2,haha,old skool outkast...i lovethis 2 disk andre/big boi s%#t did no justice to the way they used to be ...i even tried to find just one song with a tight beat to listen to or bump in my car and only found one...!!just one out of both cds!! sad really it is
2,Terrible,"What has Outkast done. They were one of the best hip hop groups out when they had structure and balance. Then someone told andre he could produce his own album. I'm going to be real here, Big Boi's cd is ok, it has some good tracks, but it doesn't stand out. Andre's cd is the worst hip hop album i have ever heard, EVER!!!!!!! It is a real shame too, because he's one of the most talented MC's ever and his album is just plain bad. if you want to check out Outkast, get ATLiens, it's from a time when they were hungry and flowed from a love for hip hop. This new album is a sell out and unless your a 13 year old girl who loves her a hit single, don't waste your money. Peace"
2,Disappointing...,"Speakerboxxx/The Love Below is by far Outkast's most disappointing album. The fact that they have two seperate discs for each artist was a mistake because their combined talent and unique personalities is what makes them so good in the first place. Big Boi's Speakerboxxx is very sub-par, his rhymes are mediocre and the constant interludes with his kid talking are annoying. Andre 3000's side has two good songs, ""Spread"" and ""Hey Ya"" but his love songs get repetitive after awhile and are not nearly as good as his rhymes. For those of you who are just getting into Outkast, I recommend skipping this one and picking up Aquemini or ATLiens, far better examples of their talent. I hope the next album they get back together and stick to what they do best because, simply put, an Outkast divided does not stand."
5,Should be illegal to be this good,Outkast did it seperately and still shined like the sun on a saturday. I personally think that both albums are fives b/c they are exactly what Andre 3000 and Big Boi have always done. Dre has always been a little different. And Boi has always been the more street rapper of the two. This is an album for Outkast fans and not for the fans of the singles but the fans of all the past Outkast albums. This is another timeless southern classic. Peace
5,Groundbreaking,"Without a doubt one the best album you'll hear this year. No one has the creativity that these two posses. They come with something good on every album, but always come with something new and creative. You could listen to other hip hop classic albums but none could ever measure up to the unique sound that OUTKAST has. They've well held their name as the greatest hip hop duo ever even when they're not together."
2,"they let me down, they'll probably let u down 2","i am/was a huge outkast fan. i have all of their cds (except stankonia), and not one of them was mainstream garbage. but now, speakerboxxx/the love below (should've gotten their best songs and made 1 cd) is now mainstream crap played on mtv every day. whatever happened to the great rhymes of ATLiens or aquemini or southernplayalisticadillacmusick? the love below is andre 3000 singing about sex (pure garbage). what fun! but on speakerboxx, big boi does a pretty good job, which is why this cd/s got 2 stars (2 much collabos).if youre an old outkast fan, dont even think of buying this. but if your an 8th grade girl who listens to mainstream crap like my band, yeah, and tipsy, this cd is perfect for you and will fulfill if not exceed your expectations for a modern (...) rap cd"
1,Am I listening to same cd everyone else is???,"This CD is such a big dissapointment. After listening to Hey Ya,Roses, and The way you move, I decided this CD must be good.SURPRISE!these are the only good songs on the album, and by the time I git the Cd these songs were played out.I seached desparately for a good track,and had no luck. THen I got a sinking feeling in my stomach. I spent so much for this CD and I do not like 1 song (Besides the ones I had mentioned before)If u really want to listen to the singles they put out, then buy the singles, Dont waste 20 bucks on this extremely dissapointing album."
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!!!,I LOOOOOVE OUTKAST AND THIS CD EXPLAINS EXACTLY WHY! THIS DOUBLE DISK ALBUM IS PERFECT FOR WHEN U WANNA JUST BEAT AROUND WITH BIG BOI OR WANT TO HAVE SOME GOOD LOVIN WIT ANDRE. IF YOU APPRECIATE MUSIC IN ALL FORMS U WILL DEFINATLEY LOVE THIS CD.
1,This is not Hip_Hop,"What the Hell is this??? I mean Amazon put this crap in Hip-hop C.Ds and I tell you guys this is not Hip-hop.This sounds like the Beatles (Iven if I love the Beatles).Outkast must been drunk or really high when they did this record! I accept that hip-hop has to grow but not in this way! If you are a hip hop fan and that u are looking for a good C.D, don't buy this crap, don't buy this crap!!! I'm a nice guy so I put one star but only for the featurings with Killer Mick,Ludacris and Jay-z. This is not hip hop I'm telling U the truth!"
2,Outkast The Love Below,"The reason why I gave this 2 stars is soley because of 4 or 5 songs on Big Boi's disc. I've seen Outkast a number of times in concert and those were some of the best concerts I've been to. Just listening to 88 percent of this cd made me want to vomit. How does an artist completely change there genre succesfully? By going completely teeny bop. Every one of Andre's songs is without rap and there all about love crap. I've tried to listen to these songs multiple times as I never base my impression on just the first listen and I still hate this CD. This album is a perfect example of why people download music. I will now download the next 2 albums of Outkast to make up for about $20 I wasted on crap songs. By the way did anyone see Dre's acceptance speech when he won a grammy for Hey Ya? All he said unconfidentely was ""thanks"" Even he probably feels like he didn't deserve that grammy."
2,Too original for me,I give Andre props for being original but Im just not feeling what he's become. Big boi's cd is the reason for the 2 stars.
1,Oh my God!!!!,"This is this biggest load of garbage that I have ever heard in my life. Both cd's are WACK!! If there was any doubt that Outkast was through, there isn't now. This has got to be one of the worst rap albums in history. Don't get me wrong, I love Outkast as much as anyone, but this album sucks. I have never heard an album so wierd in my life. They ought to be ashamed of themselves for putting out such crap. If this is the best they can do, good riddence to bad rubbish. Please don't ever put out another album this bad. It's even worse than Aquemini! Save your money and pass over this so-called album."
1,WHAT THA HELL!!!!!!!,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY SOLD OVER 10 MILLION RECORDS ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP. I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T BUY THIS BECAUSE I WILL WANT MY MONEY BACK. IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD ENOUGH TO BURN IT.
3,Half a double,"I very much enjoyed the Andre Benjamin half of this double album. He has a terrific voice, the tunes are melodious, and the lyrics are listenable. The second album was not my cup of tea. The two styles were so different I wondered why they were put together."
2,A few good songs and the rest is no good.,"In this album, we have two sides of things. Speakerboxx and the Love Below. Speakerboxx is mostly rap based. Pure hardcore rap. The Love Below is hiphop with some more soul. The Love Below is better. All in all, you are only buying this for 2-4 songs, so you might as well download them."
4,"Different, but good","It's a lot different than I expected it to be, but OutKast switches their style every album, so I cant say I'm really surprised at how off the wall it was. It was well worth the purchase price though (I got it for 10.99 on release date). Also, I thought Roses was a little crazy, but still funny in its own way."
4,HMMMMM.......,"The Speakerboxxx album is a good album. His flow is incredible and the background music on his songs isnt too bad either. The Love Below is weird! BUT....not realy in a bad way. IT is just...strange and very experimental. Best song is ""Hey Ya!"" #9 on The Love Below. i say get this cd to hear something that is not done much in todays world of hip/hop."
4,Pretty Good,"I'm gonna leave this short. At first, I hated Dre's CD, It grew on me very quickly however, and I must say it is rather good. I guess my primary reason for writing this is in regard to those say things like ""this isn't even rap! I got ripped off!"" Well, so what? Dre's CD is him expressing himself musically. He isn't selling out: if he was, it WOULD be a straight up rap CD, ie. what everyone expects him to do. How can he fully express himself if it can only be through what everyone else wants him to do?"
4,Caroline!!!,this cd is better then any of there previousit is cool and collectiveu should buy iti mean they have had three major hits. Roses especially is about to blow up. put dust in all there competitions facesbuy buy buy!!!!this cd is goodi also recommend Chariot by Gavin Degraw or chicken and beer by ludacris
4,Everlasting and Everchanging,"This album is very good. So many rap albums today are so alike; all the artists rap about is sex, drugs, guns, and da hood, but Outkast continues to reinvent themselves with every cd they release. They force you to listen to what they have to say instead of spewing on about a bunch of crap that's unoriganal and boring. Outkast is so unique and origanal and they make music what it's supposed to be...fun. There's a song for everyone on this album. The only problem I had with the cd is that Andre doesn't rap enough. He's proved he can flat out spit in songs like ""A Day in the Life of Andre Bennjamin"", but I wish he do more of that."
2,THIS C.D. IS JUST PLAIN BAD. THIS IS MY EXPLANATION.,"What is this stuff????? The only two credible songs out of both c.d.s are Hey Ya and I Like The Way You Move, which are the two you can hear on the radio every ten minutes. If those two songs are the only reason that you're getting the c.d., then it's not worth it at all.I Like The Way You Move and Hey Ya are no examples of the c.d. It sounds like two different duos, when you listen to some of the stuff on there.Please, do yourself a huge favor. If the reason you're getting the c.d. is I Like The Way You Move and Hey Ya, then just burn those two songs and get on with your life."
1,Outcast slipped,Outcast have released a lot of good albums in their reign but this one is horrible. 2 Cds and only 3 good songs on it.
2,They Fell Off....,"Let me say first that I love OutKast and I have loved everything they've put out up until this CD. The Love Below is nothing more than Andre 3000 attempting to sing and stay on beat...these songs would be great, but they are sooo slow and all about the same thing. I didn't like any songs on The Love Below. I liked 5 songs on Speakerboxxx (Bowtie, The Way You Move, The Rooster, Tomb of Boom, & Flip Flop Rock). Maybe it's just because this CD is so different from everything else they've done. Very creative...I'll give em that...very unique...and if I could i would take it back. OutKast fell off...."
1,About as fun as a root canal,"This album is complete trash that isn't worth 10 cents. Ever since OutKast cursed us with their prescence some 12 years ago, the hip-hop community has been punished by their simply horrible music!"
1,terrible,"i had to TRY really hard to like these albums and i still dont. to put it in simple terms, big boi's album isnt good, and andre's just plain sucks. i'll focus on andre's album the most because it stood out so much. it really sucked. i'm sitting in my car listening to the tracks and 1/2 of them are interludes. it sounded like a demo tape from a wannabe rapper trying to make it big but doesnt know he sucks. andre's album could possibly be the worst album i ever heard in my entire life. i'm SOOOOO glad i bootlegged it. i would have never wasted $16 for such garbage."
3,Mann hold up!!,"Ight, first let me jump off and say,nigg is a lil disappointed. Dre is my nigg, but he fell off with The Love below,he would have soundied tight on ""Bowtie"" on Big Boi cd. Big Boi fo show doin it up with the ole school sound beat's which make this joint off the meat rack. The Video for ""Way you move"" is off the chain with that Brown Skin Boppa (Mann!!). If you truely a fan of the group you'll get this joint to add to yea collection. If not try and just cope the Speakerboxx side. No Down Loadin get the real Deal."
3,Hip Hop is DEAD!!!!,"I have been waiting for this sound for about 10 years. I have always loved the spacey experimental funk of the older bands like Funkadelic and (some) Jimi Hendrix and until a couple years ago, there werent many groups/bands doing it. Although Big Boi might still be beating the dead horse of hip hop (its dead, even Andre3000 says so in YRB Magazine....check it out) Andre is finally realizing his full creative potential. Align this with Electric Circus (Common), Worldwide Underground (Erykah Badu), Headphone Masterpiece (Cody ChesnuTT) and Ceelo Green and His Imperfect Perfections for a list hip hop inspired intelligence. Keep pushing the envelope, Oukast, youre almost there!"
1,OUTKAST SUCKS! Plain and simple,"OUTKAST is the absolute worst rap group to date.... they suck so bad. If anyone could explain to me how they are classified as rap/hip hop it would be greatly appreciated.... They should be under the genre of either Funk or Childrens Music! This cd sucks just as much as their other ones.... actually it is probably their worst album to date. They have 3 songs that are good out of all their albums.... Rosa Parks, B.O.B., and Ms. Jackson...so just download them or dont get them at all..... Worst album i ever heard!!!"
1,NOT Classic Outkast,If you thought this would be a classic Outkast CD like Southernplayalistic or Aquemini or ATLiens you are sadly mistaken. Speakerboxxx sounds like Outkast meets Techno and Love Below sounds like Outkast meets sappy love songs with no beat (aka Justin Timberlake). Anyways the basic jist is if you like old school Outkast you might like about 3 songs out of all of them... if you like new school rap meets a bunch of [junk] then you will like this cd. All I have to say is what happened to Outkast... they definately fell off... their last few cd's have just gotten worse and worse. If you are even considering buying it check it out online first so you don't waste your money.
3,Slippin..,"Almost every album since southernplayalistik has slipped...they're just getting too off the wall, they'll eventually fall off."
3,confused but in a good way i think,"I'm gonna start by sayin what the f%#k were they thinkin when they decided to do two seperate cd's, I mean don't get me wrong they're alright, but Andre 3000 can not do it on his own, so The Love Below is what gives this album a low rating. Big Boi's Speakerboxxx is the only thing that keeps this one from getting a two star rating. I leave with this Big Boi keeping doin your thang and Andre go to Big Boi's Boom Boom Room and get inspired by booty shakin girls of the ATL."
3,Can I rate them separately,"Everyone of the previous reviewers will hate my review, but hey,I'm sharing my opinion. I liked Big Boi's album. Definitely loved ""The way you move"", it has the old skool feel-I'm lovin it. The rest of the cd has some good songs as well.Dre's cd....... i'm at a loss for words. I didn't feel his cd AT ALL , i felt that he could definitely be classified as 'alternative'. Was he smokin when he made this? I guess i'm not into the whole 'artsy' vibe. Some of the songs seemed to have a good message but a lousy & LOUD presentation.Maybe this cd didn't live up to my expectations b/c I was expecting something similiar to their previous work? I'm not sure, but I wasn't feeling Dre, period. My friends urged me to listen again w/ an open mind & my opinion has not changed. I'm now trying to give Andre's cd away. If i coul rate Andre alone, he would get 1/5."
2,fell the fu*k off!,"first off, most people that LOVE this album probably wasn't listening to outkast albums like Atliens and Aquemini but probably came in on the whole Stakonia uproar. this album is a joke. outkast has lost their minds. for one thing, andre is the better lyricist of the two but he decides to sing on his disc and big boi is left by himself to rap which is not that good of an idea. you want some GOOD outkast then listen to their first three albums and leave this commercial pop trash alone."
1,ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT...Give me a BREAK!!!!,"Hey Ya is the STUPIDEST song ever written...how can anyone like this garbage?? ""SHAKE IT LIKE A POLOROID RECORD""??? ""ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT..."" GIVE ME A BREAK!!! If this is a hit, anyone can write a song. I may write a song... ""THROW THIS RECORD IN THE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE..."" There it is, my hit record about Outkast.NOTE TO EVERYONE: PLEASE DON'T FOLLOW THE CROWD AND SAY THIS SONG AMD OUTKAST IS GREAT. BE DIFFERENT, DONT RUN WITH THE PACK AND REALIZE WHAT TRASH THIS IS. In 3 years people will look back at ""Hey Ya"" and Outkast and say what a joke they were. Believe me."
1,300+ reviews CAN be wrong!,"Please, don't believe the hype. If your favorite reka sto doesn't have listening stations, please, bootleg it before you buy it. It's bad meaning bad."
3,Only Andre 3000 album is good.,"Big Boi's album is very, very, very dry. The only good song is ""The Way You Move"". It seems like Big Boi is trying to be a hardcore rapper or something. Its not like he is not a godd rapper or anything its just that he seems to be overdoing it.Getting to Andre 3000's The Love Below....that is a very talented album, it is so different, yet so fresh...and I guess you can say clean.Later!!!"
3,A little underwhelming,"If you haven't heard already, Big Boi and Andre 3000 have gone their seperate ways this time and made a solo album each, but still packaged them together as one album. Both discs are vastly different. So which disc is better? Well, neither of them are really that great. Big Boi's album Speakerboxxx is strictly rap and gets boring pretty fast. Dre's album is fresh and has a wider range of styles, but suffers from his puerile lyrics about love and sex. It does however have the killer hit ""Hey ya"", best single of 2003. Overall pretty dissapointing. Big Boi and Andre should really get back together and work on something."
3,below average for outkast,"This cd is by far not their best work. Since this is a double cd there are twice as many tracks and probably not as many hits. I miss the duo exchanging lyrics. Andre has some stuff that grows on you, but Big Boi's best is already out (the way you move) with just mediocre songs the rest of the way. I think that the fans are overrating this release. Looking forward to their next albumn."
3,a guide to small kids that like hey ya,If you like hey ya just hey ya then don't buy this cd it is nothing like hey ya if you like outkast and have past rewcords of theirs then buy it because you must like hip hop if you don't then don't get it the only good songs on the album pesonally i think are dracula's wedding and hey ya only two without explicit content that i like be carefull y'all. Matt
5,Genius,"Andre 3000 is simply a master of his craft, and he keeps growing. ""Hey Ya!"", ""She lives in my Lap"", the list goes on, they are all brilliant. I'm so excited about where he will go next, needless to say I felt that The Love Below was the stronger half of the album. Big Boi did put it down though on Speakerboxxx, it's not as easy to listen to though. Long live Outkast!!"
5,Revolutionary,"For all you cats hating on Andre 3000s part of this great 2-CD set, stop it! You're witnessing greatness. At a time when everybody is sticking to the script and refusing to be creative just to sell records, Dre had the courage to be revolutionary...and he pulled it off. We've been waiting on music to be our generation's Motown, Curtis Mayfield, George Clinton/Parliament/Funkadelic/Bootsy Collins, or Prince...and Andre did that. He threw out the cookie cutter. For all of you faithful hip-hop/rap heads, Big Boi made sure you weren't left out. He dropped some hot tracks for you. Together, they put together the best ""rap"" album I've heard since...well, Stankonia. And before that...well, Southernplayalicadillacmusic"
3,Thumbs Up & Down,"If I had to bet money on whose side of the cd would be better judging from the singles out now, I would've bet on Big Boi. But his side was GARBAGE. ""The Way you Move"" was a ten on a scale of 1-10, and the song about being so fly, but the rest was a waste of money. I don't know what's cute about having a little boy curse, hatin' on Michael Jackson, and having his son ""rap"" the lyrics to ""Whole World"". Parents think whatever their kids do is cute. They have to understand that the rest of the world doesn't.On the other hand, I don't press the ""Next"" button on Andre 3000's side. His side is much longer, much tighter, and genuinely made me bob my head when I wasn't laughing hysterically (Where my panties at? was off the chain). I still don't like his single out, but the rest of the cd was a ten."
2,A dissapointment,"Im a really BIG Outkast fan and I really anticipated the release of this latest album and it was way overdue. Wow the minute I heard Andre 3000's CD I didn't even know what to think besides wow this is definately not the same outkast style as before; it is more of an jazz mixed with techno if I could some it all up. As for Big Boi's CD it was not bad it more like old outkast but it lacked impact as far lyrics are concerened but I have to say that big boi's disc earned the 2 star rating. I did like: the way you move, happy and knowing. I can't wait for Outkast to go back to their old style. Aquemini and ATLiens are definately outkast best (in my opinion). If new wave type style music is your taste this CD may be right for you."
2,what???????????,"ok i knew dre was switching his style but damn! althought he has the better songs of the double cd...big boi did not by any means put any effort into his portion of the music there were only a few songs i liked""prototype"",""she lives in my lap""and ""a day in the life of andre benjamin""are all the types of music i was expecting throughout the whole cd(s).i am a huge fan of oukast and think that dre is one of the best lyrisistin rap,but as much as it pains me to say this,....this is the worst outkast album they've ever put out...i went from highly excited to highly dissapointed"
4,cop this album,"i agree with itchyvinyl. i like big boi's speakerboxxx better than dre's the love below. and yea dre is a much better emcee than a singer. big boi sticks to outkasts normal vibe while dre comes out with a funky jazzy record that is below my expectations. but nonetheless, this is a great buy for any outkast fan or really, any rap fan. i give it 4, not 5 b/c dre needs to go back to rapping instead of singing. i already cant wait for the soundtrack they have comin out for their HBO movie in 2004. outkast, keepin it real! ATL 4 eva!"
3,1/2 excellent,"Big Boi album: GreatAndre please leave this type of music to Prince, who's 1000 times better than you, and stick to rap (you're great)"
4,outkast=greatest hip-hop group of the year,i love outkast. the songs on this 2-disc cd are incredible.
2,most OVERRATED group ever!!!,"Ok, I'll admit i've never been a fan of Outkast. But everyone started talking about how ""original"" and great this new cd was, so I decided to check it out. BIG mistake!! I was already sick of the first two singles by that point. And there is NOTHING else worthwhile to listen to on either disk!! Roses is one of the worst songs i've ever heard, and the video is very annoying. I gavce this 2 stars because, well, there ARE songs that aren't about being a ""gansta"" and getting it on with ""ho's"", so that's kind of original I guess. I just think the state of hip-hop and r&b is REALLY sad when a mediocre album like this gets so much praise...don't bother buying if you've heard the singles already."
5,"not neosoul, not rap, not urban contemporay, strictly hiphop",This is one of the best CDs I have EVER bought. The last cd I played this hard was jill scott first album. What makes this a master piece is that this CD is so FRESH. I could write more about this album but there is no point just go get it.
3,Relevant is all it has going for it,"This album (both sides) really had me going for awhile, it has become less impressive each time listen to it. I think that Andre's side is especially, while tracks like Prototype, Spread, and A Day in the Life of Andre Benjamin stick out all it really did is make something that was already there clearer to the pop audience. It's like ""wow you can mix styles of music and make them sound good, amazing!"" To me it just seems just like they just expanded on Stankonia: Andre was able to go crazy and just basically do whatever he wanted with out having to cater to Big Boi, and Big Boi was able to get better tracks although falling in the shadow of Andre. I think the fact that Andre was able to right a few really good pop songs learn to play some instruments and just do some freaky stuff shocked people. It is somewhat relevant but only in the slightest sense. Flip Flop Rock best track on either disc."
3,"mixed feelings, but still a good album!","Big Boi = 3-5 starsDre = 4-5 starsI recently bought this cd on this hopes that it would be a great album. While on the way home I popped it in, and I thought Big Boi's cd was pretty good. Then I tried Dre's cd, and skipped through every song at rapid speed. I thought I'd have to throw that cd away or something. Then I decided to listen to it while I was laying in bed one night, and since, I've loved it. It grows on you. I think I will listen to Dre's cd more than I will listen to the other. He has done a GREAT job on this cd!! Just give it a try, or a few tries, if you think it's not for you. Trust me, it's great!"
4,"Not my usual flavor, but it taste great!","After being absolutely dazzled by the video on VH1 for Hey Yeah, I purchased the set and cannot listen enough to The Love Below. I'm 40+ and would rate the disc up there with The Beatles-Sgt. Pepper album for freshness and the superb blending of musical styles. My friends joke that Andre 3000 might be shocked to see me so enthusiastic about the whole thing, but the sound is that good.I am biased toward local Atlanta talent, but I was not as pleased with Speakerboxxx, which had that angry vibe available from most rap/hip-hop artists."
3,not worth the $,you get 2 CDs but really theres only about 1/2 a CD worth of valuable content.... unless you like slow repetative tracks with zero creativity and all a desire to burn up valuable time on the CD. i think they came up with the 2 CD set idea before they had 2 CDs worth of quality music. however a handful of their tracks harken back to their earlier music and provide a vision of whats to come. overall rating: dont buy it brand new.
5,They did it again,It's funny to see someone can do it over and over again. They do it in several different ways in this double cd. It's not easily heard. Listener has to focus on lyrics to achieve the moment dre and bigboy are catching. It's somehow amazing. These lyrics just keep coming at you.
4,Outkast - Always the freshest sounds,"I think this album is amazing. The first time I listened to it, I was a little thrown because it was so much different than I was expecting. After listening to it a few times, I started listening almost exclusively to the Big Boi disc. Many of the songs are just incredible.. I even like the track with Jay-Z (who I normally don't like very much.) After a while, I broke the Andre disc back out.. and wow. I hate to use the word 'revolutionary' but that's exactly what this album is. There is so much to listen to here.. don't let your first impression deter you."
5,Andre 3000 Is Shakin' Like A Polaroid Picture!!!!!!!!,"Andre 3000 is going crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My favorite tracks on their Grammy award winning masterpiece; ""Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"" are: ""Roses"", ""Behold A Lady"", ""Love In War"", and ""She Lives In My Lap"". Outkast won 3 Grammys and 3 more of the total of 6. ""Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"" sold over 9 million worldwide (9x Platinum) all the way to the Diamond!"
4,3 stars for tlb ;; 5 for speakerboxxx,"the love below was okay, but not really my style. if you like more r&b, or slow rap songs, you will probably prefer this cd. i prefer big bois cd much more. i like ""harder"" rap and all the guest stars. this is still a great collection of songs, and deserved all the nominations it received."
5,Great album,"I didn't like the love below at first, when i was just skimming through the tracks, i left it sitting there for about a week ,then i decided to give it a try and i put it in the cd player. Now its in my cd player all the time i must have listened to it about 100 times over and over in the past week."
5,OutKast cranks out another hit,"At a time when most artists run the risk of sounding the same over and over again, OutKast proves to the world that Hip Hop is what you make of it, infusing their own thang and creating something new. Like many, I was totally unprepared for Andre's album, but I totally loved it. It takes a lot of confidance in oneself to go out and produce something so different, yet he pulls it off with aplumb and shows the world that Andre 3000 is indeed multi-talented.Big Boi's effort was not to be left behind. His album packs the solid punch that the double disk album needs.OutKast has done it again, and as a die-hard OutKast fan, I might be biased, but I believe that you should really go out and try this album."
4,"This is closer to a 5, perhaps 4.6","I am NOT a fan of rap music, and I particularly detest the vulgarity that pervades most rap. However, I really like Speakerboxx/The Love Below because most of the album is about consciousness rather than blasting somebody's head off, or smoking reefer. I must admit, I've spent more time listening to ""The Love Below"" because of its rather eclectic groove and the fact that Andre appears to have borrowed a page from Prince's playbook. Me being the Prince FAM that I am, it's difficult to resist.Big Boi's ""Speakerboxx"" is what I would consider to be an instant classic. I believe that more rappers will try to be more creative and insightful as a result of the jams included here.Perhaps the only reason that this CD doesn't get a 5 from me right now is that no song on either disc reaches the creativity level of ""Rosa Parks."" Big Boi and Dre revolutionized hip hop with that track. As I listen to Speakerboxx/The Love Below more, expect it to approach a 5."
2,Very Disapointed,"When you buy an outkast album you expect RAP not [junk.] If I wanted singing I would have bought R. Kelly. I want rap, the southernplayistic style. when you have something that goes platnium everytime don't you think you stick with it. I hate buying new music without hearing it, thank god for the internet."
5,Great albums...,"These really are great albums. Andre 3000 and Big Boi never disappoint me. Some of the standout tracks are ""Behold a Lady"", ""Happy Valentine's Day"", ""Dracula's Wedding"", and ""Love Hater"" on The Love Below, and ""GhettoMusick"", ""Bowtie"", ""Unhappy"", and ""Reset"" on Speakerboxxx. I would give this 4.5 out of 5, however, because there are about 1 or 2 unnecessary tracks on The Love Below and Speakerboxxx, but still amazing."
2,Mainstream crap-hop at its worst,"Wildly overrated, eccentric just to be eccentric rather then for the purpose of furthering the music...don't be fooled by the hype, this album is nothing special, in fact it's quite irritating..pick up some of their old stuff, or better yet, just leave Outkast alone altogether."
1,SUMBODY SHOOT ME,"There is rap, hip-hop, gangsta rap back in the 90's. In the year 2000 you dont hear none of that. All you hear is hip-pop and rap crap. Who are theze str8 up BOZO'S known as outkast. YEAH....they got nice clothin....NOT!!! I think im gonna hop on my clown car and buy some pink fur coats like theze sissies. Hell NAH....listen to sum real rap muzik....especially undaground muzik cuz undaground talkz bout real life....theze outkast got too much imagination and i think theze bozo's sniff too much crack.....PLEAZE DONT BUY THIZ ALBUM UNLESS U ARE A FUTURE CLOWN"
1,They're kidding right?,"This is just an unbelievable disappointment. These two have been putting in good work for about a decade, and then this. I'm just waiting for Andre to tell us all he was just kidding. Even Big Boi disappoints. Sad man. I hope they bounce back, this is almost as bad as Mos Def ""experimenting"" with rock. Stick with Hip Hop, it's why people fell in love with your music. Experimentation is fine, but this is horrid."
1,terrible,"nothing like any of their other albums... they experiment, but they take it too far and it sounds like crap. also, too many skits and worthless songs."
1,Andre's album sucked but Big Boi's was good,"This album was really dissapointing especially that song, ""Carolyn""...whatever the song's name is. What da hell was Andre thinking?!! I know he was trying something different but hello...doing something different doesn't mean doing whatever!! It's really sad how they went from ATliens to this crap!! I'm shocked!! If Andre can't sing or if he was trying to do something different on that song, ""Carolyn""...he didn't have to go overboard by just doing whatever. Oh, it's got to be whatever!! Big Boi's cd was good on the other hand...now, he meant business. I can't believe it was the best album of the year but again, we know who thought it was....obviously, those that don't have their rythm straight...Andre, get your head straight!!!!!"
1,Where is the love?,"Girls, don't lay out any cash for this trash ...or any other crap rap ... that just tells how he's gonna give"" it ""to you cause hes so great. We need to start demanding more from our men then just that and then let them throw us away?? The songs of love set the tone for us so far I ain't heard any from this group. A quick one in his caddie tisnt no love song laddie. Bindare want mo than that."
2,I no u can do better,"Dont get me rong, ive loved outkast ever since i heard ATLiens and Aquemini, but this is unexcusable. After burnin this and expectin alot of creativity form a 2 disc set, i was shocked. The only reason this is gettin 2 starz is cuz of andre's creativity on his cd, big bois cd SUCKED. No creativity wut so ever and wit horrible guests such as Jay z and the eastside boyz. Outkast needs alot of help in the future for them to drop another classic."
5,Pay attention. . .you might miss it!,"speakerboxx/love below is the best i have heard all year. 3000's cd is out of control!(Awesome!) I listened to it at first thinking, ""What the hell is this!"" Now, I can't even listen to anything else. I am so refreshed by Outkast and so inspired by Andre 3000 for not being afraid to be himself. You absolutely, have to buy to this c.d. You have to listen to the love below over and over in order to appreciate the art of it. Again,it is out of control!"
3,"Hard to get around at first, but turns out good.","This double album is very cool, and VERY HYPED,ill cut to the chaseGood songs on Speakerboxxx: The Way you move :( and BowtieGood songs on The Love below, nearly all of em, maybe some not, but here are some:Hey Ya!, Roses ( I LOVE THIS ONE SO MUCH I LOVE IT I LOVE IT, THIS DESERVES A BAJILLION STARS!), Draculas Wedding , Take of your cool ,a day in the life of Benjamin Andre, all out its good,Speakerboxx Disc1 : 2.2 StarsThe Love Below: 3.4 StarsAll condensed 3 stars, Try it out tho!"
4,Alt Rocker Review,"Im not a fan of rap music,hip hop, or anything remotley tied into the music of the normal outkast fan. I listen to alternative rock, punk,metal,techno,bands like Nirvana,The White Stripes, The Vines, Tool, Anti-flag, VAST, Our Lady Peace, A Perfect Circle, and Damien Rice. Not at all someone who you think would like outkast. Ive heard a few songs from the cd, and i love it. Theres just something about Outkast that seems real.There stuff is awesome. I recommend the track Vibrate, very good song. Anyone with any musical interests, should give this album a chance."
5,TWO TITLES,"I ONLY HAVE LITTLE TO SAY ABOUT OUTKASTS BLAST FROM FUTRISTIC PAST. THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT HIP HOP MEANS TO BLACK PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. ITS THAT NO MATTER HOW THEY TRY TO LABEL US ADAPT AND DIVERSIFY TYPE OF MIND STATE WHICH IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR SURVIVAL.TWO SONGS ONLY NEED MENTIONING BECAUSE YOU CANT SHINE LIGHT ON THE REST THEY ARE ""UNHAPPY"" ON SPEAKERBOXXX-A BALANCE WITHIN ITSELF AS BIG BOI RHYMES ABOUT HARD TIMES OVER AN UPBEAT HAPPY TRACK,-AND ""PINK AND BLUE"" ON THE LOVE BELOW-PURELY AMAZING - DRE THRILL DOES IT AGAIN OUTKAST DOES IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. RIGHT ON TO THE REAL-strive niner"
5,listen to it more than a couple of times and you will loveit,"when I first got it,I was just listening to Speakerboxxx, but tonight, I listen to the whole ""the love below"" disc and I love it. Dre is really creative. You can tell that he really put alot into his songs.Now i think I like the love below better than I like speakerboxxx. So when you get the CD, don't just listen to the first couple of seconds of the songs and skip the ones you don't like. Really when I did that, I skipped almost all of them. But when you take the time to listen to the whole album, you will see it in a different light."
3,In there own class,"This collection is some of the best hip-hop you can find right now...Big Boi' seems to keep to the same ""pimp style"" many fans have come to know and love about Outkast with his jam that has the following words, ""crocodiles on my feet, fox fur on back, bow-tie 'round my neck, that's why they call me a gangsta' mac, in a cadillac..."" How can you not love that style???Andre 3000, is on some planet that most hip-hop artists will never probably get too. His style is truly unique...""just lean a 'lil bit closer and see that roses really smell like boo-boo."" Who else would write something like that? Maybe Biz-Markie would have, but that is about it...Ya gotta buy it!"
4,I can dig it,"As a rule I don't go for hip-hop, maybe a song here and there, but this I like. Each song has a fun groove you can get into. You want to dance-like in - ""Hay Ya,"" or in ""Love The Way You Move."" No matter what track you hear there is a fresh sound. It's a great find."
1,I'm so disappointed,"It's lucky that it was a gift as I wouldn't have wasted my money buying it.As a great fan of rap/hip hop, I'm sorry to say that this double effort from Outkast doesn't make my cut. Maybe next time buoys..."
5,A NEW LOVE FOR STANKONIA'S BEST!!!,"Boy I wish that I lived in Stankonia!! This double CD is the best of the best!! It incorporates Big Boi's style and Andre's. Everyone knew that Andre 3000 has a flair for fashion, but for it to be incorporated into his music is beautiful. They both speak from the heart as always, and I'm soooo glad to finally hear Andre singing, and sticking to always being different! You have to go get this album and make it #1 until the end of the year...Trust that there is not going to be another album better than this one, (of course until Jay-Z..Nov. 28)"
2,don't be fooled....,"My friend from work just lent me the new Outkast double CD and, well, it sucks frankly. The rapping is terrible and the beats are dull. Outkast tries to cover up for what is lacking in skill with flashy production and speed rap. didn't fool me.buddy"
2,what is all the hype about,"i don't get it they call this album ""genius"".i find it hard too listen too.it is for kids.if i hear hey ya one more time i will shot myself."
1,IS THIS A JOKE???,AND THE WINNER OF THE WORST CORNIEST ARTISTS OF THE YEAR.......OUTKAST....HEY YA!! WHAT A JOKE..THESE 2 WOULD GET THEIR AZZ WHOPPED IF THEY CAME THROUGH MY HOOD..THEY ARE THE WORST..YOU KNOW YOUR BAD WHEN LITTLE GIRLZ AND OLD PEOPLE LIKE YOUR MUSIC...THATS THEIR WHOLE FAN BASE..I GIVE THIS ALBUM A NEGATIVE RATING..I WOULDNT OWN IT IF IT WAS FREE..HECK NO..ALL YOU OUTKAST FANS STICK TO THIS CRAP THAT YOU THINK IS RAP AND LEAVE THE REAL RAP FOR THE REAL HEADS.. I NEVER SEEN A GROUP FALL OFF LIKE THESE SUCKERS..THEIR GARBAGE
4,Confused,"I love Outkast, but I don't know what to think about these CD's, especially ""The Love Below,"" I think I like it, I will follow the majority of the customer's advice and continue to listen, because from the first listen I was like what the ****?"
3,OutKast should stick to being a group,"First of all, everyone who thinks andre's album is creative genius is way off. Dre is a tight rapper, but only flows a couple of times on the whole album. Some of the singing songs are tight, but it gets old when all the tracks are about love. If you like that buy a Ja Rule album.Big Boi's album is alright, but only has a couple of good songs.I just hope when Outkast makes a new album they stay creative (ATLiens), but don't have dre sing on all of the tracks."
1,Warning do not waste your money,"Yes thats right this album is a waste of your money any if you listen to it, your time. The entire album/s have an appauling lack of talent and no real music. I fail to see what Andre and Big Boi are trying to do here...unless is it completely ruin their reputation, because I see that. I dont even give this album one star. I bought this album off of the recomendation that it was really good hip hop/rap, I dont think that i could have been lied to more. If you see this album on a shelf in a store my advice is to run, run far away and not look back. Do yourself a favor, buy andre 3000 it will remind you of the days when Andre wasen't a mainstreem 60's trying sell out."
1,"This isn't Hip-Hop, too strange to even call music.","I loved all of the Outkast albums until I collided head first with this garbage. What the f**k happened? I use to like there different style, but this album is really weird. All the songs are wack, I can't believe they just totally switched their sh*t like that. They turned really soft on their real fans. If you like this album you're just blinded by the fact that you like Outkast. If you like this album keep it to yourself, I can't picture any real hip-hop fan jammin this weak CD in their ride or in public, what a total collapse by Outkast."
1,O Pleaseeeeeeeee,I am a big outkast fan. Hater I am not. I love outkast in the past for there original style. selling 2 different cd's as many had me wanting and expecting the best of both worlds. Dre has always been on the edge with his style & Big boi he just bring it to you mostly. This album is not the best it is definitely the worst Outkast complication I have ever heard. I listened to it for about a week now. I tried to be objective and give it a 2nd 3rd 4th & 5th try but to no avail. Dre has more singing & music that is PRince (Purple Rain) music than anything. I am far from close minded. It hurt tru Outkast fans to admit that this is a junk CD. It is very easy to not say that to support OUTKAS. I SUPPORT OUTKAST and will always be a big Outkast fan but this is definitely up to Outkast level that they have set. With maybe 4 hot tracks off a 2 cd set
1,?,"I don't get what's going on. The new Outkast is terrbile. Forget all the hype, just listen to one song and you will not want to buy this cd. At least that's if you are a real rap/hip hop fan."
1,clean rap is an oxymoron,"seems like amzn is in the censorship business, as my previous review was taken off. anyway, what I said back then still stands. andre's cd is garbage. what new sound? the only good songs r hey ya(actually this is mediocre but compared to the rest it shines) and roses. big boi's stuff is all right. got this ""clean"" version from the library. I dont buy cds or dvds, i illegally copy them after getting them from the library. u should do the same if u aint no punk, but i suspect u r. andre recently whined on some award show about not illegaly downloading music. i have 25,000 illegal mp3s on my computer....andre 3000, go phook urself..."
4,Bad Ass Cd,"I bought this Cd just for the hell of it i wanted to spend some money...lol....well when i first listened to it, i was like ok this is cool then i kept listening and i really got attached to it. Big bois CD is bad ass with tracks like the way u move and bowtie this cd is awesome.......andre's cd is just average for me but its worth buying this cd just for big bois cd"
4,Rap? Not rap.......,Like any great artist Outkast is hard to pin down and takes a while to appreciate. If Frank Zappa and Prince collaborated on a release produced by George Clinton it might sound something like this.
4,Really good Outkast people.,"I usually don't like rap, or even hip-hop/funk that much. However, this cd really appealed to me. This cd, mostly the song Hey Ya though, is very universal too. My parents, my sisters, my friends who like hardcore and 80's music, and even my grandma likes Outkast, but mainly Hey Ya.The first single has such an appeal that it is played on practically every radiostation as well. But, enough of that song. What I like is when bands experiment with new types of sound and a different kind of music than they usually do. The cd The Love Below, I feel succeeded doing that.However, the reason I gave The Love Below/Speakerboxxx 4 stars instead of 5 is because of Speakerboxxx. I just can't get into Speakerboxxx no matter how many times I listen to it. If the band would have just released The Love Below, then I would have gladly given it 5 stars."
5,A Master Piece!!,"I got this double CD as a birthday gift, yesterday. I must say, that I was blown away, this is a Masterpiece!! Let me start with Dre. He has set a new standard in eclectic. From, ""In my lap"" to Prototype, you can see that this man has been influenced by a lot of people. You can hear, Prince, Sly Stone and EWF. My favorite track is, Prototype it just has a grove to it.Now, Big Boi, keeps it more close to the vest. This is something that I was a disappointment to me. Not that his CD is not good, it is great. It is just that, it sounded like an OutKast cd. Overall, these CD's should be used in future music theory classes. For they have given what the music of today needs, a shot in the arm."
1,STANKONIA!,"Bla,bla,bla,this album stinks! The producing is horrible, the ""rapping"" and ""singing"" is even worse and the beats are unmentionable! The album is simply the corniest, poorest exuse for music I have ever come across in my entire 23 years on this planet! I would rather eat rotten gumbo than listen to this trash! Don't be a boring fool and waste your money on this mess!!!"
2,grammys they didn't deserve,"I like outkast a lot I think that ""southernplayalisticadillacmuzik"",""atliens"",""aquemeni"" and ""big boi & dre present..."" are great hip-hop cd's but I just didn't feel this cd.The cd is more dancemusic than hip hop.I don't understand why it was so succesful.This cd is one of the worst hip hop albums out there.Probably their creativity took them,one of the best hip hop artists ever, over.Why big boi and dre why?"
2,nah,"I don't know about this one. Yes, hip-hop (or whatever passes as hip hop nowadays) needs to change from the dull junk most of it has become (not J5 and some others) and experimentation needs to happen in order to breathe new life into the genre, but I think that Outkast miss on this one. Especially from some really great albums (i.e. southernplayalistik!! and ATLiens)...It's a little too in your face poppy. they have always been so smart in their stuff, it just seems like they are trying to bring it to the masses through this watered-down-clown-groove."
1,Sellout 3000,"There aren't enough words to say how disappointed I am with this album. Only reason I gave it 1 star is because Big Boi had sense enough not to sellout and stuck to being OutKast while Andre tries to be the next Prince. But even Big Boi was barely even trying with his lyrics. The only good songs on Speakerboxx are ""The Way You Move"", ""Bowtie"" and ""Church"".I understand why Hey Ya was #1 on TRL so much, and that's because TRL is a pop video countdown. Dre has definetly sold out. If you wanna hear OutKast and their best, buy Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, ATLiens or Aquemini (Stankonia was alright, but not as good as their first three). The Love Below is the one that really smells like boo-boo."
2,New Outkast: Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,"this is a very big dissapointment to me. i like the old outkast days when they were together on their raps but on this album they had seperate cds, which is dissapointing. Andre's side has tracks that feel like they're soulfoul , he mostly sings on his cd. then theres big boi's side which is also dissapointing because his rhymes are wacked! he should of took more time, both of them should've. i can tell why the two singles were ""hay ya!"" & ""the way u move"" because they were about the only good songs"
3,It's........okay............,"I just bought the new disc, and listened to both cds...uhm...all I can say is that besides ""Hey Ya"" I won't be listening to any of the other songs on The Love Below. Actually, I can hear that song on the radio, so that disc probably won't ever re-enter my cd player. It's way out there. Not my taste at all. On the other hand, Speakerboxxx is awesome! I really, really liked the songs on this disc. It's a toss up. I loved one disc and hated the other."
3,"ok, but no Aquemini or ATLiens","this album is alright, its cool that they tried to experiment with new stuff. But am i the only one that thinks they should stick with their style from Aquemini or ATLiens. Those albums were [...] amazing. This album just kinda made me shrug. I only heard about 4 good songs. OUTKAST GO BACK TO AQUEMINI FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!![...]"
2,Speakerboxxx rocks!! The Love Below BLOWS!!,"I bought the CD, listened to it once and man was I disappointed. I though hey, 2 CD's for the price of 1, but all I got was 1 decent CD. I am amazed this album is #1 for the second week in a row! The Love Below was one of the worst CD's I have ever listened to! It sounds like Prince and George Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelic got together and made a very craptastic album. Speakerboxxx on the other hand saved this CD, and it has a typical Outkast flavor, but is not worth more than $6.00. There are only a couple really good tracks on Speakerboxxx and the other ones are just ok. If you were smart you will not buy this CD. I bought it, sold it to some sucker on ebay, and I say good riddance!"
4,a great series of videos,This is a great series of videos for learning the Five Animal Frolics style of qigong. The videos are well done and easy to learn from. See my reviews of the Bliss and Power Qigong for more details.
1,"Good for storage, but not for reheating.","I bought this because I thought I could use it at work to reheat left-over pizza. I have a pizza stone at home and always reheat pizza in the oven on the stone because it comes out crisp and delicious. Unfortunately, I believed the advertising on this item and my pizza came out of the microwave floppy and yucky just like it does if you just reheat it on a plate or paper towel. Tasted like soft mushy bread with cheese on it. When I picked it up, it flopped right down. Disappointing at best. However, I think it's great for storing the left over slices rather than trying to wrap each one of them in aluminum foil which is both expensive and difficult to cover a triagular slice with. So, I don't really know if it's worth or not. Would I re-buy it? No. Do I use it for storage? Yes. So not a complete waste of money, but not all that great a gadget to own. In other words, you can live without it."
2,Not exactly the historical saga you'd expect,"I had loved the boy in the striped pajamas, however I am somewhat disappointed by this Boyne novel.As entertaining as it might be to some, it gave me a very quick and shallow sum-up of the history of Europe in the last three hundred years more than follow a clear storyline. Some chapters were totally irrelevant to the main plot and the two phases of his life, its beginning and end, on which the author puts most weight, were quiet honestly, boring.I had bought it along ""Mutiny on Bounty"" and hope that the second book won't disappoint me like this one did."
5,thief of time,Interesting story of a man who never gorws OLD; lived still at 257 yrs. Not a story like Dorian Gray at all - no portrait growing old and ugly with a youngish mans life of meaness and hate. Instead this story is many stories within about this man during his many centuries of living. Very interesting. I liked it!!!
3,It was just Okay!,"I must admit I was a little disappointed with this book. I guess I misunderstood what it was about.. I did get through it, it just took me awhile...."
4,"Adventure, humor, deception, and above all Love through time.","I love the story, the way it is written, very addictive and multicolorist. I could see an adventure Tv series right there. But the last page broke it all (or didn't it?) After all, I must respect the author's decission although the story has a great potential to become a book series. I never got tired of reading this book and... I wanted more of Mr Zela (Matthiew, please). Lovely written."
2,Thud!,"Another of the dreadful international films that (deservedly) killed Bryan Forbes' directing career, DEADFALL has popped up in a handsome Fox DVD transfer. So what? This picture's still the snoozer it's always been, with the usually reliable Michael Caine dull as dishwater here. Leading lady Giovanna Ralli is lovely, and nearly unintelligible; sounds like she's made a valiant stab at learning English phonetically. At that, she beats the dire Nanette Newman, the exceptionally untalented Mrs. Forbes, who's unfortunately thrust front and center in his films of this period. Here, she's easily the world's least enticing starlet, cavorting around behind her usual filters playing her usual ingenue that she's a good fifteen years past (no, no, Nanette!) A nice John Barry guitar concerto is cross-cut to little effect with a wowless heist sequence. This picture is strikingly photographed, expensively mounted, and DOA."
2,Transistor Electronics by Gerrish/Dugger,"A High School textbook (1981) about basic electricity with only one forth of it on diodes and transistors. The title would more appropriately be ""Basic Electricity and Electronics for High School Students""."
3,Room for improvement,"This book isn't bad. It covers a wealth of material and gets into a fair about of detail on how to set up a photoblog, mostly on the suggested Nexcess.net.This is fine should you choose this route, as you will have all the information on how to do that.What could help the reader is a better organization of the material presented to keep one from having to go back and forth between pages to take in the examples presented. This will probably happen in the next edition.Other than that, I admire the author's talent, knowledge, and enthusiasm for photography and blogging."
1,a headache,"a lot of fluff in this book, but when it gets down to building a photo blog, your at her mercy as all of the lessons require that you sign up with nexcess.net (which is a total rip off!) and even then, the coupon for the free month doesn't work. I tried using a different host, but it's rather complicated to install the programs and templates she uses in the book unless your really good with websites. this is not a beginers book at all."
1,Throw it in the Fire,"This album is 100 percent hoedown music. Most every song is identical in sound. This is terrible stuff. I purchased this because I understood these guys to be a hip, country or alt-country band. After listening to it, I am not sure what type of music fan would like this--perhaps ""Cotton-Eyed Joe"" or ""Turkey in the Straw"" fans. The lyrics in these tunes are moronic, and listening to the songs is absolutely painful. I am selling my copy to a used CD store today. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Those w/ conflicting interests should not review titles.,"...such as members of the band or those involved in production. No objective person would characterize Cowboy in Flames as ""waking up country music"" or as ""masterful."" The album has one tolerable song, and that's it. Just listen to the links above to find out what the album is about. God, these guys .... I would rather listen to a cow give birth."
1,Vile christian propiganda,"Think about it, have you ever seen a film this bad, come on,give it a good thought,no, i would reccomend showgirls or caddyshack 2 before I would ever recommend this swill. Only rent it if you are a big fan of UPN"
3,a good movie for a debutant and for $7m.,"even though i've seen much better Christian movies than this, i have to agree that considering the budget put in, its a pretty good movie. as long as it opens doors for more christian productions in future, its all worth it! and direction wise, Matthew crouch is still learning, but like they say, 'its not just a movie, its a miracle!' so if God's working on this..everyone better buckle up..! you never know what would happen."
5,Hollywood didn't have a clue!,"This was the best Christian movie out there. Of course this isn't the best ""movie"" but it's the best Christian movie. I loved the whole movie, It was great! It seemed a little hurried at the end though, but it's still great. By the way, this movie IS RATED. It's RATED PG-13. The rating isn't listed above, so I thought I'd tell you!"
1,Bad Taste in Christian Entertainment,"I endured the 1 hour 40 minutes of this film and as a Christian thought that this film is very dangerous and damaging to authentic bible prophecy as it mixes truth with error. Apart from the bad acting and violence, a lot of scripture was quoted, especially from the books of Daniel and Revelation, but misapplied in spurious ways. A true insight into bible prophecy can only come from the book itself (with God's guidance) and not a fictitious movie."
2,A waste of my time,"I rented this movie in the hopes of getting a gripping good vs. evil/end of world type film as with The Omen, or even The Seventh Seal or End of Days. I didn't get what I wanted. The Omega Code is a confusing movie with no suspense and what I feel is bad acting all around. Any remaining comments would not serve as good an example of my opinion of the movie than this: I got about half way through it one night before I gave up and retired for the night, intending to finish the remainder the next evening. I never did. I just didn't care enough about any aspect of the movie to go back to it...and it's rare for me not to finish a movie."
1,HOLY COW!,"I just have to blow off some steam here. This movie is the WORST, most POORLY WRITTEN movie of 1999. The sole computer effect seems to be a building blowing up in quasi-slow motion (it's obviously a model.) Satan, when he FINALLY shows up, looks like a Gumbyfied dog in heat. And the dialogue...I won't even go there. The only people who'll like this movie are Christians who have lost all sense of art and goodness and care only to put more people on their resume. I'm a Christian myself, and I can tell you: disregard all other reviews. This film somewhat resembles the Book of Revelation, but it blows everything out of proportion, virtually skips Armaggedon, says empathetically that the world will end in 2000 (hey, everybody...it didn't!), etc., etc. I don't know if Christ would even like this movie. Avoid it."
1,"I wanted to like it,","but you would have to search long and hard to find a worse movie. Whether you believe its spin or not, this film was so poorly done that it might have actually been better to watch with the sound muted. Don't let the celebrity names fool you. This film stinks."
3,Halfway OK,"Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought. The acting was often questionable, but Michael York seemed perfectly at ease as a supervillain. Sure, there were some plot holes you could fall right into, and the ending was definitely abrupt. On the up side, there was nothing that could be construed as Christian pontificating, and there were enough explosions, fast editing, visions, shootings, and car crashes to keep you awake. I don't expect family friendly Christian films to be exciting or...good...but this was at least entertaining."
3,Intro to Bible Prophecy,"Having spent the better part of 18 years studying Bibleprophecy, I had high hopes for this film. The production values areexcellent. However, only a basic introduction to Bible Prophecy is given, and though the Bible Codes work well in the movie, I'm not convinced of their validity in this area. Michael York gives the best performance of the lot and is most enigmatic as the manipulative world leader. No suprises for the well-read prophecy student, but a basic introduction for the novice. Though not perfect, it ranks among the better prophecy films produced. Try to remember it was made for only $6.5 million dollars, which is 1/3 what some actors alone receive for starring in a film."
2,Don't try to convert me!,"Starts off with potential, but just starts to ""scare"" you into coverting! I rented this to watch a movie not to tell me that I need Jesus. I respect the fact that it is being accurate to the book of Daniel and Rev, but this movie goes too far. In addition, the acting is very bad and the story itself isn't that interesting."
1,Worst movie...ever!,"This is the only movie I ever walked out on before the ending (I lasted about 30 minutes.) And I have sat through some stinkers! I wish I could give it a few hundred negative stars but, sadly, one star is the lowest rating."
1,Don't believe the hype!,"I checked out this indie psuedo-scifi movie after hearing a bunch of buzz that it was pretty good. Wrong. It is confusing, poorly acted, and boring. The story was intriguing, but the scriptwriter fell on his face early in the writing process and never recovered. If you want to watch and excellent movie (that came out first) dealing with hidden codes in religious transcripts, I recommend checking out Pi...a far more superior film all around. As far as The Omega Code goes, stay away from it, or rent it first."
3,An Interesting Plot,The concept of the movie is this: the end of the world (Book of Revelations). The movie starts out really interesting and then it goes slowly down hill. If you like things with religious tones or have a curiousity about the end of the world...this movie is interesting even though it does kind of hault to a stop. I will say that it has a good plot to it and I was really interested...but the ending could've been better.
2,no no no!!!!!,it is just plain and simple.. I DIDN'T LIKE IT!! I have seen many movies about the end of times and so forth.. this was boring.. and it doesn't follow the biblical text as it is supposed to.
3,Christian views,"Good movie but not so sure it's worth buying, I wish I hadn't bought it, but just rented instead."
1,A Christian who hated it.,"I wrote a review for this movie a while ago (see ""good thing I only rented it""). And it amazes me to see the un-Christianlike comments the so-called Christians are making.... Calling people who disliked the movie 'pagans' and telling us to fear the wrath of God for judging 'his work'.I am a Christian, and the movie was terrible *gasp*. I urge those who liked it to rent a film starring a good actor like Harrison Ford or Kevin Spacey, and compare them to Casper Van Dien.... I shudder mentioning him in the same sentence. But I even doubt that a great actor could have saved the script. As a general rule, I dislike any movie that has two grown men air-conducting classical music in a scene that isn't supposed to be humorous.Let's see if from now on we can stick to reviewing the movie, and stop pre-judging the reviewers religious beliefs."
3,Apocalypse Now ?...,"Intentions were excellent by the writers, actors and director; but not enough to save this film from it's own apocalyptic demise. Why ? The acting was either dismal or melo-dramatic.The special f/x were not exactly near the caliber of ILM (George Lucas' special effects company).Yet, the subject matter is very fascinating and the timing to release the movie for theatres was no coincidence;2000, new millennium, etc.,etc.).On an entertainment value level it comes close to a good thriller for a rental..."
2,Omega Code -- God help us.,"I'd heard that a faith based organization wanted to put out a movie that was able to get its message across without using the basic staples of other popular movies. I'd thought they'd only meant sex, violence and drug references with a little bit of obscense language thrown in. I never dreamed they meant direction, decent acting and script writing. Casper Van Dien has apparently been studying under the Tom Cruise method. Stand there and look pretty but heaven forbid you should do good work. I understood what the plot was. That was pretty effortless. Getting there seemed a challenge for the filmmakers though. Oh, yes. I kept track of the violence. There was at least as much gun play and killing as in a Bruce Willis movie. Just not as graphic."
2,The End is Nigh!,"My kids picked this out from my local video store last night when there was nothing left due to the rain. It started off OK and kept their attention but then they started asking questions, sometimes about the sub-standard plot, sometimes about biblical references, then they started talking and making fun as the story deteriorated until the closing scenes when they felt rather cheated but at least it had kept them occupied for over an hour an a half.I could not bring myself to review this movie personally, but I thought I would share my kids reactions.By the way my kids are 11 and 8, have a religious upbringing but are aware of what goes on in the world.The Omen is far, far away a better movie and obviously the source of a lot of ideas for the Omega Code.PS. By the way after Armaggedon how can there be an Omega Code 2?"
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad Acting","Let me just start out by saying - I couldn't make it through the whole movie. I'm sorry - I just couldn't stand it. After watching it about 45 minutes I just had to turn it off. I couldn't stand it. The story line was weak, but the acting was just horrible. Who ever told Casper van Diem that he should pursue an acting career was playing a cruel joke on the world. I really wouldn't waste my money on this DVD"
4,This is the closest you can get to Biblical truth!,"Omega Code is the closest to the Biblical truth you can get! It is meant for action, but that isn't the whole genre. It is suppost to show you the prophecy in Revelations about the Anti-Christ. This is a cool movie with novel-like cliffhangers that lead up to the Rapture! Believer or not, this is a great movie with drama, action, and truth!"
1,Just Terrible!,"I rented this movie out of curiosity, but it was so bad I could barely stand to watch it the whole way through. With the popularity of action-thriller movies, I guess the filmmakers felt that a Christian thriller would make a lot of money. There are many movies out there that aren't given the label ""Christian"", but are much better and more inspiring than The Omega Code. Don't waste your time on this. It isn't even good in a ""so bad it's funny"" way."
5,Masterfully made and something for the whole family!,"The Omega Code is a masterfully produced,exciting and interesting work presenting a Biblically-based portrayal of the apocolypse.The acting and quality of the production is excellent.In my opinion,The Omega Code is one of the highest quality Christian films ever produced,and indeed the best movie I have ever seen."
1,Terrible,"This is the worse movie I ever saw, It was so boring I fell asleep in the middle of it and when I woke up I really didn't miss anything. The story was really lame the acting was worse. Save your money."
1,Gibberish,"A film which purports to be true to the bible & then revises it cannot be other than disingenuous. Plus, apparently, the ""end times"" will witness generous gibberish & exaggerated demeanors. Good Lord, deliver us!"
1,Just Terrible,This movie has to rate as being one of the most boring movies of all times.It's just terrible in every respect. You just keep waiting for something to happen.......... but it dosen't. Don't waste your money or your time!
2,Boring as can be,This movie is so boring. It starts out good at the begining and is good at the end but in the middle this movie is so boring. I say if you are looking for a action movie do not pick this. It has some action but that is only the shooting that are dumb. Do not waist your money on this.
2,Nahhh,"I must admit it was fairly entertaining, but the acting andmuch of the story was outright artificial."
1,How about half a star?,One forgets to even look for a plot in this movie as it is so poorly acted and directed. The acting is wooden and what plot there is lacks continuity and development. Wouldn't even suggest this for a rental. Read the book
3,"Made for Christians, by Christians....the message is clear.","There is a love and hate for this movie by the critics on this list which can be explain simply. If your a christian, you going to love this movie. If your not a christian, your going to hate this movie....period. I seen this movie from beginning to end and must say that the plot and storyline makes sense from a biblical standpoint, which i cannot say the same thing for the Ninth Gate, which makes little sense. The acting can be better but they really try hard so kudos for their efforts. If your not a christian, this movie will bore the life out of you since that is what my friend said, who is not a christian. I know some christian friend who enjoy this movie alot. Let's just say that i am at a crossroad as far as my faith is concern at this point but this movie did show me that life is short and one who waits might regret it in the end."
1,"Awful, convoluted, bad acting Mess!","Promising premise. Bad Acting (hello! Casper Van Dien?Pluuueeese), badly executed story, horrible writing and weakdirecting. Enough said. See it if you want a laugh at the expense of Trinity Broadcasting."
1,"Waste of time.... ""christian"" propaganda","Don't waste your time or money.... It's all about the so called ""Christians""They may as well be the Taliban, given the way they try to force their opinions on vunerable souls....Thank GOD they don't have guns....God bless America!!!!!!"
1,A Chick Tract for the big screen,"Complete with Basil Exposition as the anti-christ. What a laff-riot.This film plays like a parody of itself. Could be an embarrasment to us Christians if we take it seriously, but I for one do not. None of the actors seem to even remotely take their roles seriously, with the notable exception of Michael Ironside. Mr. Ironside is the only one who does a decent acting job in the entire film. He delivers his usual better-than-average ""bad guy"" portrayal.I like to think of The Omega Code as a Jack Chick Tract on film. If you are a Christian you *know* what these are. (The little ""Christian"" comic strips with the hellfire/devil-n-demon/apocalyptic message intended to ""scare"" you into belief.) All it lacks is for Ironside's character to laugh: HAW HAW!"
1,Worst...movie...ever,"I've made it a point to try and see as many of the films in the IMDB 'bottom 150'. I wasn't surprised to see <I> The Omega Code </I> in that esteemed list. It's a dreadful film that hasn't found any niche. Born-again fundamentaloonies never took to it because it isn't 'biblically accurate.' Most sane people dismissed it off-hand. If it didn't completely bomb at the box office, it's because of it's 'limited theatrical release' and the fact that it was [messed with]so well by TBN. Now there's your 2.7 mil at the box office. The TBN crowd (read: instant gratification evangeloonies) flocked to see this croaker. They also put money in Benny Hinn's pockets. Enough said.Well, it didn't take me long to get a hold of this. Most video stores have this stored away somewhere. This is pure MST2K stuff, people. The acting is wooden, the plot is nonsensical and it's just totally pointless. Was this supposed to make me drop to my knees and praise the Lord?I was too busy laughing. Avoid!"
1,BAD BAD BAD,"to the director, actors and writers of this movie: don't give up your day jobs.Film.com voted this film as a candidate for Mystery Science Theater--boy were they right. I find it easy to suspend belief for the sake of entertainment, but this was just to far out there. Example: the main character is in LA running from the police. in the VERY next scene, he wakes up in israel in some castle with the female lead, who explains that she found him passed out on the street in LA and brought him back to israel, on a private jet, in a car, to a castle without help and without his waking up. PUHLEEEESE."
2,Not all that good,"Y'know, this movie is not what i'd expect from something supposedly dealing with the End Times prophecied about in Revelation. Yeah, they revealed snippets of prophecy, but they left out massive parts in the story. And also it appeared that the anti-Christ needed the Bible to tell him what to do. And anyways, it was terribly done in the first place. Cheesy pyrotechnics, terrible computer generated effects, and non-Christian people supposedly converting everyone to Christianity. I mean, i dont know about you, but to me a movie like this needs not only to be accurate, but be done so that people can get the feel of the real End of Days--this doesnt even go into religiousness really, its like people are afraid to go out and show real Christianity in a Secular movie area. If you want to see a good movie about End Times, read the Bible or Left Behind series and envision it in your head. I highly dis-recommend this movie."
3,Not Bad!,Worth the watch. It has a biblical theme and you can follow the idea(s) being shown on the screen. Would recommend.
4,Not Bad But Could Be Better,"If I could rate this, I would rate it as a 3 1/2. The movie was slightly better than average at best. Casper Van Dien was so fake in the movie that it was hard not to laugh. The plotline was really not well written. The only reason I liked this movie enough was that the events was quick paced and the graphics was pretty good. The Omega Code 2 turned out to be much better."
3,Good but not great,"While this was a good movie to watch in that it is a Christian movie, it does not follow the Bible enough regarding the end times and what it says in the Book of Revelation. I applauded at the end but it was missing a lot of details that are referred to in Revelation. Other than that I would recommend watching it for entertainment, not fact."
1,Mechanical Properties of ceramics: A student's perspective,"Mechanical Properties of Ceramics was the textbook used in my graduate Ceramics Engineering Class. I felt that the book was rather lacking in many respects. Very often, formulas occured without any explanation of their origin or any sort of derivations. Additionally, a few of the derivations that were presented were wrong.Many of the concepts were explained very vaguely and it was difficult to follow the author's train of thought. It was sometimes difficult to follow why various conclusions could be drawn, or why certain assumptions could be made.As a student, I do not think that this was a very good textbook. During my course, I tried to read the textbook carefully and in detail, but often found myself very confused. The text and the mathematical formulations and the conclusions did not follow a logical and consistent order."
5,All the way,"Ken Navarro's CD titled ""All the Way"" is really cool and relaxing. Every song is a gift to my ears. I truly enjoy tracks 4 & 11, ""In the sky today."" I will buy more Ken Navarro's music."
5,A Positive Story of Adventure and Friendship,"Teman, who's 12, is attracted to the exciting world of magic and mystery. He discovers he has the gift of magic, and on his quests meets many thrilling characters, starting with Velachaz the wizard. This is young adult fantasy available hard copy and as an Ebook. You'll find humor, suspense and characters who are believable. It's a fast-moving, positive story of adventure and friendship. Teman is a character in whom teens can see themselves. This is a story sharing the value of teamwork and the importance of belonging and believing."
3,The Right Hand of Velachaz,"Rie Sheridan sets the stage for what could be a series of fun adventures spinning off virtually any character in her book, The Right Hand of Velachaz. Sheridan's story was a great introduction for beginning fantasy readers and I look forward to future stories from this author."
4,Interesting life.,I enjoyed the material about Domenico's life. There was alos quite a bit about the times as well. I have yet to read the analyses though.
5,all i can really say...,"...is that THIS one is REALLY THUMPIN' !!!! ...and a 'SPIRITUAL ADVISORY' WARNING IS DEFINITELY IN ORDER!!! NO DOUBT!!!! if you're stupid, it will make you sane, and if you're sane it will make you stupid...go figure..., but SERIOUSLY, it is THAT GOOD!!! lol!!!"
1,There are much better books out there,"I ordered this book along with ""The Smart Woman's Guide to Plastic Surgery"" and ""Change your Looks, Change your Life"" for patients in my office. These others were FAR SUPERIOR in every aspect-- depth of information, pros and cons, etc. While reading this book, I kept thinking that this read like a poorly researched high school term paper. Rather than clear, concise information, it had a lot of pointless ""filler words"" as well, causing me to wonder if their editor told them they had to beef it up from a two page outline in order to sell it as a book. I was very disappointed in this and highly recommend purchasing the others instead."
3,Dated but interesting,"Originally presented in 1992 by London Weekend Television LWT/ITV. Includes 6 25-minute programs. Attempts to cover all sides of various political and monetary issues which were in the air at the time, doesn't flinch from controversy, and includes interviews with some who voice highly critical points of view. Quite a lot has changed since then, but it remains an interesting time-capsule. Elizabeth II's personal style, attitudes, and work ethic have become so entwined with people's ingrained understanding of how a monarch and sovereign generally behaves that it is going to be a great jolt when she is inevitably succeeded by someone who isn't an exact duplicate."
4,A Love to Last,"This is not a run of the mill love at first sight romance. Even though the manga is short Kyoichi Katayama is able to express the deep motions of Sakutaro, a high school student, who is in love with and suffers after the loss of Aki, his girlfriend that dies of leikemia. They know that the life they had planned to lead would never happen but it is the love they have for each other and the feelings expressed byt he characters that make the story so speacial."
3,"Good, but not great....","To be honest, I can't really see what all the hype has been about. Everything happend at an accelerated pace, and it all feels like a bad soap opera. The descriptions of the feelings of losing someone are quite accurate though, having experienced them myself. I finished it in less than 3 hours--it's a really quick read, with a little over two hundred pages (and grossly over priced, IMO.)."
5,What I liked about my order of Kitchler pendant lights.,"They were exactly as described, and also matched perfectly the fixed bellamy Kitchler fixtures we ordered earlier. I would recomend Kitchler lighting to anyone as I think they are good quality for the money."
4,Piano Tackle Box,"I bought this item for commercial/ residential hardware, not for fishing. It is fantastic... easy to carry, tons of organization and a dream to have everything I might need in one place at all times. Jakespeare"
5,Great for what I wanted. Good quality,"I bought this as a sewing kit, I wanted to be able to remove portions of my sewing items and not lug around the entire box. This product is perfect because I can organize the removable compartments according to the projects I am working on and have everything I need ready to go on a weekend trip or just around the house. The price was a little more than I would like to pay but I'm happy with it. I like quality and am willing to pay for it, everything seems to fit together well and the plastic is as good or better than other similar products. I don't worry about it breaking with normal use."
5,EXCELLENT FOR TINY PARTS,"I use my tackle box to store beading supplies. It has ample space and partitions for all findings with room to spare. The upper part, under the lid is perfect for storing beading tools."
4,Big tackle box,Well this is coming from a 12 year old but I liked it. Its big and its for compact. Great Tackle box overall
5,This is a sturdy tackle box.,This is a sturdy tackle box. The small boxes within the tackle box can be removed and easily carried when fishing small lakes and ponds when you don't need the entire tackle box.
4,"A mature, hearfelt album by one of rock's finest songwriters","I've idolized Paul Westerberg for years. The best work he's done--with The Replacements and as a solo artist--ranks with the finest music ever recorded. This album shows that he's come to terms with who he has been and who he is now and is unwilling to hide his true self. The songs here run from good to great and, as always, Paul wears his heart on his sleeve."
3,OK.....perhaps my first review was a little harsh,"Since the last time I reviewed this album I have had the chance to listen to it several more times. It probably deserves 3 stars or perhaps 3 and a quarter. This album was written and composed during a dark time in Paul's life.....perhaps the lyrics should convey more of this than they do (Lookin' Out Forever does). For what this album could have been check out ""You Come and Go Like a Pop Song"" by The Bicycle Thief. Bob Forrest (lead singer) emerges after a dark period with an album of equal parts cynicism and hope. For those of you who don't know Bob--he was lead singer of Thelonious Monster--a band that the Mats influenced. T-Monster often performed Mats tunes in their concert sets"
5,one of the best of 1999,"Nevermind the naysayers, this is great stuff. Paul is still a god and always will be. This is full of soul and great songwriting. Honest to goodness ""old school"" mats fans who admired them for all the right reasons will love it but more importantly, as a friend said, this has nothing to do with the Replacements and why should it?"
5,From clever to poignant,"Paul Westerberg has produced a truly elegant, minimalist, folk/rock complilation. While some fans may deride the lack of wit on ""Suicaine,"" compared to his Replacement's work and his two earlier solo efforts (both favorites of mine), I would argue is actually an evolution towards poignancy and directness that comes from a more secure and mature artist. Sometimes cleverness can obscure the truth. His infectious melodies and plaintive vocal delivery will move from between your ears to deep under your skin. Give a listen to ""Sunrise Always Listens"" next time you find yourself in a cloud of melancholy. You can tell Paul has been floating there also--and taking musical notes to bring back for us. Bravo."
3,Disappointing,"I really wanted to love this record. Unfortunately, I can't. I rather like the laid back feel of the record. Almost like a polished demo. But, ultimately a PW record must be judged on the quality of the songs. The overall quality just isn't there. Make no mistake there are some truly nice moments. The excellent first song, ""Wonderful Lie"" sets the quiet tone. ""Looking out Forever"" is the only song that really takes off and soars. By the time you reach ""Actor In The Street"", its nap time. This record just doesn't live up to the quality of the previous two. For the long-time PW fans, we can only hope for better next time around. For the uninitiated, better off spending your money on the ""14 Songs"" or ""Eventually"" records."
1,Pod Westerberg,"Love Paul Westerberg. Hate this CD. Take away Wonderful Lie and Best Thing and it's unreleasable. Having Don Was at the boards didn't help, but the blame has to fall on Westerberg himself. The songs are simply meandering. Possibly the worst album ever by someone who was once a major artist."
2,"Where have you gone, Tommy Stinson?","Well, ten years later, it's clear who shaped the sound of the Replacements: Tommy. Paul's lyrics are outstanding, but he alone lacks the musical swagger that made the Replacements the greatest band, anywhere, ever. Suicane Gratifaction continues Paul's downward arc that began with All Shook Down. He's either content to ride his career into obsurity, or doesn't care. I suspect it's the latter.If you like post-Mats projects, go find a copy of Bash & Pop's Friday Night is Killing Me instead. Tommy still has the swagger."
1,worthless,"Westerberg once titled a live album ""Dont buy or sell, its crap"" (and it was a great live album). That title should have been reserved for this unlistenable throw-away. I found myself laughing outloud at how poorly thought out the songs are on this album. Self-defense sounds like it was written by someone who's never written a song before as do most of the songs here. Westerbergs downward spiral continues on this dud. Do we give the greatest songwriter of all time another chance? I dont know. Grandpaboys stuff was decent and more uplifting than this but we'd be better served listening to old Mats albums than struggling through laughers like this."
4,Find out who really buried Paul,"Bears repeated listenings. Initially, it doesn't quite hook you the way ""14 Songs"" or ""Eventually"" might have.At the same time, it sounds like more thought went into this outing over his previous solo efforts.Also, the overall sound here is consistent--the production is excellent. Nice work."
3,Strangely Familiar,"As I listen to late Replacements,and all of PW's solo work,it's become clear that he has four of five songs skeletons that he has written. On each CD,starting with Don't Tell a Soul and especially, All Shook Down,he presents a version of each with different words and sometimes slightly different tempos.They're all here again on Gratifaction. They are more acoustic here and the recording is good. If you liked the songs on All Shook Down and 14 Songs you'll like them here.I'm a big fan and I listen to the CD,but it's all strangly familiar to me.Nothing really new,3 stars."
2,"It works great, but not for long!","Wears out too fast~This holder was installed when I had my bath remodeled about five years ago and had a Hansgrohe hand-held sprayer added to my shower stall. The first one lasted about 3 years. The second one lasted 2 years. The plastic side grippers get loose and stop holding the shower sprayer hose nut. I love all of the other Hansgrohe faucets and accessories I purchased for my bath remodel. However, this one, simple item is (as one reviewer has already pointed out) a piece of junk. I just ordered my 3rd one and they are not inexpensive. I will start looking now for a substitute product for the next time I have to replace it."
1,Hansgrohe hand shower holder,This hand shower holder from Hansgrohe is the most over priced piece of junk I have ever purchased from Amazon.It will not hold the shower head up!! The flat sides do nothing to hold up a round and tapered handle. It just squeezes the shower handle out and it falls to the floor. wwhi
5,It works great,This works just great for my Hansgrohe hand shower.Perhaps previous reviewer had a different brand of hand shower.The angle of base of hand held shower must be the same as holder.
4,"Overall, recommanded.","This book has two parts that I am not sure go togather. In the first part (p. 1-216) the authir presents his views on politics, religion, humanity and other such topics. It was the interest in these topics that prompted me to read the book. In the second part (p. 217-377) Prof. Einstein discusses his analytical work. I must admit that not beeing a Physicist, at times I was not able to follow. For that reason I cannot comment on that part of the book. Overall, I would recommand reading this book if only for its first part."
3,"Intelligent, but too dry for me","I like reading ""smart"" books. But this collection of essays was just too dry for me. It wasn't that the material was way over my head - it was just that I didn't find it lively enough to keep me going. I read a handful of essays and then stopped. I'm a fan of Einstein and, since I have a degree in Literature, I'm used to reading materials from far more ancient texts - it's not that I can't take books from the first half of the 20th century. It just failed to captivate me and that may just be my personal taste. Too bad, as I do love Einstein."
4,Good book.,"Interesting book, you will find in it something new about six sigma.I have a book from Pyzdek and one from Brayfogle, but also this one gave me new insite."
5,Ideas And Opinions,"I have not nor will I have time to read this book for some time, although I hear it is good"
4,Depends on your purpose,"If your purpose is simply reading Einstein's articles on issues like world politics, morality, peace, human beings, etc. than this is the book for you. Personally, I wanted the best of his articles, articles that you really want to read because of their specific nature or subject. This is not such a book. Simply a collection of articles."
4,wonderful reading,"All my life I have heard wonderful things about the brilliance of Einstein. I had been told he was brilliant but complex and hard to understand - they were wrong. I am sure that trying to understand his equations would make the mind spin, but he wrote far more then just equations.The writings here give real insight into the man - these are documents written by him for newspapers, interviews, and such. These show the man Einstein and his personal views from politics (and war) to his ideas of god. Its wonderful reading for anyone who wants to know more about him as a man beyond e=mc2."
3,Interesante tema,"Pelicula diferente y con una trama que te lleva momento a momento a lugares desconocidos. Si quieres ver algo diferente, la recomiendo"
2,"low quality, high price","I don't have problem paying a little more for the quality, but one of the cups from the set that I order has a black dot inside the cup, it looks like there is a fly or a piece of dirt inside the cup. The bottom of the cups are scratchy and sharp. The set also come with a very low quality box ( I am very surprise to see that there is a sticker on the box say it was made in Japan because normally I though the japanese normally produce high quality products).right after I order this set,I found a set sake set from a local liquor store for $ 25 and the quality is way better than this set I order in amazon."
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT!,"I absolutely love my curler set! I still have the original one I purchased ~15 years ago, and it still works. It's packed away somewhere due to the fact that I have been relocating more than I planned, so I asked for one for Christmas! I always get lots of compliments whenever I use it! I have fine hair, but the curls last a long time. I highly recommend it!"
2,Not a fan,I have fine hair and either I am not using it right or steam is just not a good way to curl my hair. Maybe if I had thick luscious hair it would be better
5,Long lasting curls,"if you want curls that will last for days (seriously) try caruso. Me, my mom and sister have been using caruso for over 15 years (im 24). the steam really holds the curl. i have gone through 5 caruso's over the years- here is the trick. only put in purified water. tap water kills the machine."
2,Not for every hair type,"My hair is usually perfect for styling - healthy and shiny, and I usually have excellent results with all kinds of curlers. I wanted to try this product as a more healthy alternative but did not reach the results I was looking for. I was getting the old fashioned fluffy big hair Farrah Fawcett look instead of the more modern sleek look I was going for. No matter how much I experimented with it, the result was a bit messier than desired. I believe it is the result of the moisture, as well as the softness of the foam rollers. Additionally, for someone with long and thick hair like mine, even the jumbo sized rollers are not large enough but shrink if you wrap it tightly in an attempt to get cleaner curls. It seems to be an ideal product for achieving natural looking curls without causing much damage, if you don't mind it looking a bit messy."
2,It was so hard to follow!,"I dunt think dis waz such an exciting book as reviewed by critics. The text waz hard to follow, and there were to many details, especially when dey have parts of da book narrated by Leaphorn. There waz also too much information bout da Zuni tribe. If only da author could have kept dis information to a bare minimum enough to extend da details of the mystery than the book would've been a whole lot ezier to follow. Another thing is da names of da characters. Simpler names could've helped. I'm currently reading dis book for my book report, becuz of da ""hard-to-follow text"" I had to re-read da whole book again! But overall, I think da book has a catchy tile and an interesting plot, but da story is not written in such a way dat grabs da reader's attention immediately."
4,Dance Hall Of The Dead,"Typical Tony Hillerman mystery:Good actionExcellent charactersIntriguing plotInsight into native American cultureThe only down side was one of the CD's had a defect, and the player in my car could not read after the first third. I was able to read the disk on one of my computers only. One drive out of five on three computers could read it, none of my CD players could.I could find no link for customer service on the publisher's (Harper Audio) web site."
4,Good and interesting read,"My first book by this author, and if I get a hand on another I will gladly read it. The mystery plot is quite decent and the cultural background mixed into it makes the reading also a learning experience. It is not a bad thing to pickup bits and pieces of information about topics that one would never make inquiries into. Even though that some experts in the field might argue that the author does not portray the native Indian groups involved in the novel correctly, I think that it is still quite sufficient for a general knowledge, after all if you really want to know about native Indians you would not get it out of mystery novels."
3,Not exactly what I looking for,I was looking for a hardback copy to replace a lost paperback copy. The plain binding and odd size was what i wanted but I lept anyway since I don't collect as an investment - I read my books
2,Easy reading,Easy to read good flow the characters emerged well . At times it did get pretty simplistic. hard to tell how historically correct Indian references were.
1,Package Not Sealed,"The item is not as advertised. The seller advertised a 1990 Factory sealed set. However, the cards are in a white box that is taped closed."
4,Byzance by Rochas wonderful however I found mine cheaper at,"Byzance by Rochas is astonishingly beautiful perfume. For many years it was my absolute favourite, However I found mine at a much better price cheaper at Thefragrancefactory.com they also had my lotion and shower gels in Byzance, thats the place to go."
2,You get what you pay for!,"I ordered this for a backup when/if the ones at my job malfunction and it was something I would never do again! It was delivered to me broken, the bp cuff was ok but the stethoscope was broken in several pieces!!! I will not order from this seller again and will buy something like this at a local store. It was cheap and thats exactly what it is...cheap!"
2,Lack of Standardization,"It is admittedly hard to take real-life roles and create heroic situations, even in cases where the greatest heroism derives from the most mundane.So, here's a detective story based on the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health Organizations.Not the Impossible Missions Force.Not the Green Berets.Not the CIA or FBI or even the DIA.Not even anything any normal person has ever heard of.Can this sustain interest? Offhand, I'd suspect not.It's shocking, by the way, that hospitals have not standardized ""Code calls."" Each hospital I've worked for has a slightly different protocal for codes. Given the risk associated with these, it's surprisingly irresponsible."
4,"Good, but...","This is an excellant field refrence guide providing that you have completed a class in rope rescue. Also, the pages are made of paper instead of plastic, which is the norm for Fire / Rescue field guides. Since it is made with paper, it is rendered useless quite quickly in adverse conditions. All in all, only buy this book if you are competent enough to understand the instruction and responsible enough to put it to good use."
5,Irritable Bowel = Problem Solved!,"I tried this product after reading that some folks who have had their gallbladders removed found relief from digestive discomfort (read: diarreha) with them and since they were so inexpensive I didn't feel bad taking a chance on it (besides, I figured I'd at least get some extra calcium). I was really shocked (since you can't believe a lot of what you read on the Internet) to find that their advice was dead-on.I don't know if this will help anyone else - but seriously, it helped to regulate my digestive system and now I can eat things that would have normally sent me running to the bathroom - like salad and cereal. In fact, I was researching whether salad made other people sick when I happened upon discussions about Caltrate. Anyhow, don't take my word for it - google Caltrate and assorted stomach ailments and see what you find!"
4,Easier than swallowing the tablets but...,"Caltrate 600+D Plus Chewables are easier than the large tablets but they are hard as a rock and dissolve slowly. My wife has had trouble for years getting the Calcium she needs so we thought we would try the chewables.She is not able to chew them but lets them slowly dissolve. Thankfully, they taste pretty good."
4,Tastes good,"I like taking my calcium in this format. It tastes good and you can avoid the monster pills. The only problem is that these must be taken with food to be digested properly into useful calcium. It is not obvious when you buy them, so buyer beware of this fact."
1,Not tasty,I bought these because I needed calcium supplements for a bone injury. I was disappointed by the taste. The product tastes very chalky.
5,Easy to take,I'm. Of big on swallow type vitamins. They tend to make me ill. This is a great way to get my calcium and vitamin D without side effects of swallowing a pill.
5,healthy choice,This product is a supplement that will help you avoid osteoporosis and osteopena. Taking one tablet twice a day is the recommended dosage for women.
1,Back to the calcium pills for me,"I am trying to find some way to get calcium without swallowing those monster pills. I thought these chewables would do the trick. They're even worse! They're huge -- about the size of twoTumstablets stacked together -- and too hard to chew. I have to let them dissolve, and it takes forever. They're chalky tasting, with no compensating fruit flavor. I don't want this aftertaste in my mouth all the time, so I guess it's back to the pills."
2,"Poor construction, easily broken","We had trouble putting this stool together, but did finally get it to the point where it was sturdy enough for use. But then less than 6 months later, our son stepped down on the bottom step a bit too hard and it totally broke through. The particle board was not sturdy enough and the screws just broke through the top. Yikes!"
2,Much of the paint peeled unfortunately.,"This product looked great when I received it, and my kids loved it. However, I use it in the bathroom so they can wash their hands, and much of the paint, especially around the raised portions has peeled off. Very upset, now shopping for a new stool with better quality."
5,function & form,"ultra-sturdy and stable, easy to assemble*, beautifully finished, the storage space is genius. it is too heavy for a toddler to pick up so we put felt pads on the bottom so it can be pushed along the bathroom floor. another great quality product from guidecraft* you need a screwdriver with a short (i.e. 2 or 3 inches) handle to get to some of the screws"
2,Is it a collectors item?,"I purchased the toy box from this company and I love it. The quality of the materials is great and the design is beautiful. I planned on buying this storage step up as well. However, I think that over $90 is astronomically over priced."
1,"Poor quality, broke after few months use","I bought this Storage Step-up for my grandson along with the matching table and chairs. The step-stool broke almost immediately on the top where it hinges open to store things inside and we are still trying to find a way to fix it. One of the woods that holds the hinge broke completely so it made it completely useless, a child cannot step on it anymore. It is an expensive item and we were expecting a better quality and long life. It was a complete disappointment. We were expecting better quality, we bought a very inexpensive plastic step-stool that is still as good as new."
4,highly recommended,"Highly recommended story collection for anyone who likes spare, richly suggestive prose in the Carver-Hemingway-early McEwan vein. MacLaverty tells deeply evocative stories of ordinary people without any literary tricks or cheap bendings toward genre. He helps you understand what daily life is like in Ireland while thankfully avoiding Irish kitsch. In these empathetic stories, he creates characters whose fear, anger, doubt and general misgivings about life seldom cancel out caring for others. I'm new to MacLaverty having also just read his short(and also extraordinary)novel Lamb. I plan to read all his work."
3,leaks and hard to install,"The concept is great, but it drips and was a bit hard to install for our medium size dog. We had to raise our faucet about 24 inches in order to use. I would suggest that you make sure your faucet will adjust before you purchase. Once installed it didn't take long for our dog to figure out how to use it and that is nice. Another down side is the ""eye"" sees everything that walks by... including our cat! So be prepared for it to turn on anytime you walk by or it sees you. Our waterhose is on the same faucet (they provide a y-adapter) so when we water the flowers and yard, it turns on. We are working to install a french drain to that the extra water will at least go to the flowers rather than the mulch below the faucet. Had for a few months now and still leaks constantly. Ugh!"
3,wish it were sturdier,The concept is excellent and it does exactly what they claim. My dogs did not need any training to figure it out. I wish it were sturdier. The dogs lick from it and it rotates and quits working. I had to wire it in place so that it wouldn't do that. I would love to see a larger sturdier model for mastiffs.The funny thing is that the birds in my yard have also figured out how to set it off.
1,WOrthless,"Dogs never could figure it out, did not fit our faucet well, would only dispense water when at one exact angle. Not worth the money by any means"
3,Hot Water Dog,"Unit functions well. Adjustments don't tighten up enough for two active Golden Retrievers, so I find the head pointed a kilter at times. Big issue is our desert climate. The sun heats the water in the metal clad hose to very high temperatures making it unusable at the times the dogs would need it most. Otherwise I would recommend it for automatic drinking."
4,"Works well, not perfectly suited for small dogs","Product works well and is easy to install. It is powered by four ""C"" batteries; too bad it doesn't come with an AC adapter/jack for customers with power outlets nearby to save on batteries.Also, the mounting pole is too short, so if you have small dogs (or puppies) and your water faucet is mounted on the side of the house, the WaterDog won't reach low enough to sense your dogs. Replacing the mounting pole with a short length of 3/4"" PVC pipe will easily fix this problem, though.All in all, a very good product that works reliably."
2,"I wanted it to work, really I did.","I purchased this because I wanted my dog to have fresh water all the time and I was tired of changing out the water bucket. I wanted this to work, really I did. I thought my dog would love it (which she did). But after exchanging it twice I still couldn't make it work. It kept coming on all the time, so it ran almost constantly. Tried moving it, tried replacing it, tried cleaning it out (repeatedly). Perhaps I will try again in a couple of years when they have more of the bugs worked out. Great idea!"
1,Did not last.,"Ran intermittently from the beginning. Sometimes it would not work at all, with new batteries. Sometimes my whole porch would be flooded with no dogs in sight. It made a lot of noise when it started and stopped. Both my dogs hated it. One of them would not go near it...ever. I guess you can't teach old dogs new tricks. I could have dealt with the dogs not liking it if it had worked a little better."
2,doesnt last long,I have purchased several of these and they don't last long. The latest one that broke was put on 2 months ago and quit working even though the batteries are new. Looking for substitute one.
3,Mixed feelings,"My dog loves this product. There is a downside though. We have placed the fountain on the side of our deck; Every time we walk by the fountain turns on. Our deck is permanently wet now, not good for the wood! This is something to consider before purchasing the product. However, our dog loves the fountain and I will try to figure out a way to sort our placement issues out."
3,Waterdog Outdoor Pet Drinking Fountain..,This was an excellent waterer for my dogs. They caught on quite quickly and it was really nice to know they were getting fresh water all the time. However the pvc was not as durable enough to last more than one season.
2,OK,"It runs when nothing is near it and then not run when she wants a drink. Its a good thing, but needs to have a senser that is more direct and not cover the wide range it does."
2,Did not last,"This device did not last for maybe two months.I did have it in the sun though, I would imagine it would worklonger with the detector not exposed to sunlight.My dog did love it while it lasted."
2,Director of Community Services,I ordered two Water Dog Automatic Pet Fountains. One works satisfactorily. The other one is defective and I am returning for replacement.
1,this device does not last,"This unit works great for 2-3 months, but then it fails.I have had very frustrating experience with this device for I bought 5 units so far since it came out on market.Everytime, the unit stopped functioning(or water kept on coming out without anything present). Although it broke everytime, I kept on buying a new one because my dogs love this. But now, I give up. Really, this unit works fot the first 2-3 months, and that's it."
2,Great Idea But Poorly Design,"We bought ours from Pet Smart. It is a really great idea and worked well for the first 3 weeks, then water began leaking through the battery compartment. Luckily, our dog did not get sick from the rusty overflow of water! I will wait until the design has been improved to buy another one."
3,Great idea but won't last,"My dog was so happy with the fountain, but it didn't last for long. After about a month I had to replace it, and now that won't work any longer either, even though it is less then a month old. I don't have the budget to buy a new one for nearly $75.00 every month, so I am looking for something else. I still don't know what went wrong; it simply stopped working and no battery change helped."
4,I have had no problems and am now buying a second one,"I was surprised to read the only other review citing that the water dog was unreliable. I bought one last year to use at my lake house and the dogs love it. Worked great all last summer, I stored it for the winter and hooked it back up and it's continued to work with no problems. I think I have only had to change the batteries once. I have been meaning to buy a second one for my in-town house and am just now getting around to ordering it. I keep a bowl under the spout on the ground to catch the excess water so the dogs always have a fresh supply. Works great for me so far, I'll keep you posted if I have any problems with the new one."
4,"Sassy, sexy, Sally","Some little country gems here, from Mekons' woman, Sally Timms.Especially, the John Anderson and Dolly Parton numbers.As another reviewer suggests, a must for true Mekons fans."
4,A good product - there are better,"I regularly used Slippery Elm along with Comfrey until comfrey was taken off the market. I now use slippery elm with fenugreek and thyme for the best nutritional supplemental results.I do have allergies and sinusitis and prefer the ""naturals"" such as this product.Recently I found that the Swanson Health slippery elm seemed to edge out this one.I still think you can't go wrong with it but it is no longer my fav."
3,My first impressions....,"Recently bought S5400NX. The spec seemed amazing from price-performance.Here is my opinion:[1] DVD Full Screen playback - excellent. Flawless.[2] DVD burning: Failed many times with DvdToCopy. Worked fine with Arcsoft's ShowBiz (shipped), Which is again very minimal version.[3] Recovery CD's: Doesn't ship on a different CD. Uses disk partition. You can copy it to a DVD, But only once lifetime.[4] Mouse freeze: When you install any software, the cpu shows 100% and the mouse freezes. Takes sometime for mouse release.[5] CDROM Noise: access to CDROM makes noise.[6] The above two points might be because of the ASUS technology(mother board and CDROM drives).[7] Support: International support center. Its hard to understand them. I would say chaos. Be prepared to give your contact info, even for product enquiry. Don't forget to remind that you aren't their client for product enquiry.If you can afford few bucks more:[1]buy one with Intel Motherboard.[2]buy one with DVD+/-RW support."
5,Talented young artists create one awesome album!,"Puffy Amiyumi is/are awesome! I first heard of them on a TV show I used to watch when I was younger (Teen Titans if you must know) and always wanted a copy of one of their CDs. Their songs are a lot of fun and there's a great variety. They have catchy upbeat pop songs, cool rock songs, and a couple of nice ballads. They aren't typical Japanese Pop, but they retain that Japanese charm that makes their music so fun to listen to. They have two songs in English that are pretty good, but their Japanese songs are much better."
4,Aptly Titled,"Being a non-Japanese speaker it is sort of odd that I really enjoy Puffy. After a whirlwind purchasing of all their albums I think they are a great duo whose popularity in Japan might be as high as their obscurity is in the US. For fans of Puffy this album is as good as they come.Nice is a solid effort from the center to the outer edge of the CD. Fans of Puffy's work with former Jellyfish member Andy Sturmer will be happy to find he is involved with every track on Nice. I think this lends to a better consistency to the album that some of Puffy's others might have lacked, but maybe a little at the cost of one REALLY good song (r.e. Stray Cat's Fever, True Asia, Love So Pure, etc..).In other words what are you waiting for? (unless it is for the US release slated for sometime in 2003...which is okay...I guess..)"
3,Nice!,"This is really good music. It combines pop, rock, and techo with the great Japanese voices of Ami and Yumi. My favorite song is ""Invisible Tomorrow"" because it is fast and in Japanese. I think they sound a lot better when they sing in Japanese. Another one I like is ""K2G"". Listen to them you will like them."
3,A pleasant mix of semi-sweet pop and one killer track.,"This cd is a nice*, polished bit of sugary pop, not too heavy onthe sugar, and pleasingly plump on the pop. I find the track""Your Love Is A Drug"" to be an irresistibly infectious tune whichI had no hesitation in putting on endless repeat and listeningto over and over again. That being said, it is the highlightof a cd on which, while many of the tracks are admirable, noneof the rest are quite so stunning. I don't know if they areconsidered to be ground-breaking in their native land, but thisfurlong has been plowed many times over (and better) by Americanand English pop artists. If you can't live without that onetrack, by all means, BUY IT! Otherwise, don't lament the roadnot taken -- you aren't missing much."
5,Rockin',"Ami and Yumi have another great cd under their belts here. Very catchy rock. I still can't figure out after listening to all their cd's if it's their vocals that i dig or the music backing them. I will say both together are an amazing combination. This cd is like other Puffy cd's. Hard to catogorize. There's rock, ska, a bit of country twang, and those extremely melodic tunes they always come up with that you can't stop humming. Even the theme song they did for Cartoon Networks ""Teen Titans"" is catchy and rocking! Do i recommend this cd? In a word, hell yes!"
5,-*- Best intro to the God of the Bible ever written... -*-,--- Knowing God is a classic of the Christian faith. It takesa believer by the hand and introduces him to the God whohas saved him. This introduction seems as warm assalvation itself. It also educates the believer in thebasics of the Christian faith. It gives dignity to man byplacing him squarely at the feet of the mighty God withwhich he has to do...
5,Highest recommendation,"This is a great book. I have used it in no less than three different Bible studies. By now, my copy is bent and worn from use and I have grown a great deal through studying with it. I would recommend this book highly, particularly if you are looking for a book to go through as a group. Packer's book has been used to introduce thousands to the theological study of God's word. Indeed, it was the first Christian book I read as a youth that engaged my mind in a meaningful way. ""Knowing God"" is theological - and completely grounded in the Bible - but it is also very readable and includes suggested questions at the end of each chapter. There is something in this book for both mature and beginning Christians.The book is divided into three parts. The first concerns (roughly) how we can know God, the second speaks of the attributes and character of God, and the final reflects on the Christian life and the way in which knowing God affects that life. Buy it and read it."
5,One of the top ten books you should own.,Buy it and read it more than once -- maybe once a year. The best of the best -- classic Packer.
5,Get a better theological understanding of God!,"This is a wonderful book that will intellectually stimulate anyone who reads it. It will change your understanding, and strenghthen your relationship with the God of the Bible by providing a crystal clear picture of Him. I highly recommend this book as a foundation to your Christian life. Great for the new Christian!"
5,A Christian Classic,"This book is a must read for all Christians. It discussed the foundation behind real Christianity. This book can be read over and over again, while learning something new each time."
2,audiobook review,"Packer writes this book not as a treatise on G-d, but his own admission, even though its length greatly suggests such. Packer considers this to be a series of small studies concerning G-d, as separate messages, but provided a whole in this audio book edition, narrated by Simon Vance.Vance provides a husky voice, presented in a discussion format. Vance does an excellent job at proper intonation, inflection, and authentic reading. Small groups will identify will with the narration, but find struggle keeping up with the material. In truth, this book, in itself, is evidence that audio books will never replace traditional format books (to be read, that is, not necessarily printed). Greatly complex, this book is not suited well for audio, despite the narrator's best attempts.Read the score, disclosures, and more at scriptedgenius (dot) com."
1,What a Calvinist,"The book really wasn't that good. It was the required book for a theology class I took at my Christian university. My school as a whole was not Calvinist, but that particular teacher was. If you don't agree or believe in that particular way of thinking, this book is not for you. Saying I suffered through this book is an understatement."
2,A Christian's theology of God,"I do not enjoy speaking disparagingly about a book that so many thousands (perhaps millions) of people have found helpful. Because of this, I am glad for Packer's work. Yet my reading experience of Knowing God was, to be candid, painfully boring. I yawned my way through it. If people want a thorough Christian view of God, the Bible is not only more lively reading, but it's the original treatise on the subject."
2,Hard to draw on practical experiences,"After reading this book I closed it and had a hard time relating this information to my own life. I typically dont read books for my own selfish applications, it's just that I found this book hard to follow. Maybe its me.Joe"
3,Not sure,I'm not sure about this since I haven't had a chance to read it. I needed to complete the book I had started. I will begin to read this one next week.
1,A seeming contradiction.,"Mr. Packer confuses me a bit. He seems to say 'seek Godly knowledge but don't dig too deep lest you become conceited'. All Christians need to 'know' for certain the entire gospel of Christ, how can anyone follow God unless they 'know' exactly what He's saying to us? The Corinthians had a 'wrong' knowledge of God and that's why Paul was admonishing them because they were following 'after men' (wrong knowledge) rather than Christ. The 'knowledge of God' is good and brings humility but the 'commandments of men'corrupts."
5,Knowing God,This may be the best book about knowing God that I have ever read. I go back to it repeatedly.
5,Buy This Book!!!,"Whatever you do, don't pass up buying and reading this book. Don't deny yourself the message of this book. It is an absolute pearl, a treasury of truth. I am buying several for family and am recommending it to friends. I plan to use it to study over and over. It is wonderfully written and a wonderful life changing message. I am grateful that I was led to it. Buy it and you will thank yourself for having it. Just terrific."
4,Its iight...,Umm The book is alright just that it starts really slow. I guess its because they trying to show those that dont know about flash the ups and downs but the book is alright. In the middle and during the end it starts to get a little hardcore in some ways. They do cover the basic things in flash and shows u a little about what more a user can do. The CD that comes with it is interesting in some ways . So the book is okay for the newbie and i believe the elite in some ways to have around so i give it a 4. shrug ~
3,Not enough hands on tutorials,"On the positive side this is a very comprehensive book. This would be an excellent reference book for intermediate to advanced Flash developers. On the the other hand it is not a very good book for beginners. I learn best by actually doing examples or tutorials. Unfortunately, there is not much of that in this book."
2,Not great,"Exalted's sourcebook on the Southwest. You get a fairly detailed description of the geography, politics, and culture of the kingdom of An-Teng and the Lintha pirates. An-Teng is based loosely on Colonized Southeast Asia, although I don't think the guy who wrote it actually knew anything about Southeast Asia. But who cares about that nerdiness, An-Teng would be a fun place to set a campaign of any nature.There's also a Chapter on Lintha, but its off the wall in a bad way. I don't think I'll ever use it in a campaign.Finally, there's an Antagonist Chapter, containing the usual array of Gods, Exalts, and plain old weirdoes. The antagonists are interesting, but I doubt many of them would challenge a Celestial Circle.Overall an interesting book, but not as good as the rest of the line."
5,Good for my Bible study group,"I taught ""They Knew How to Pray"" to my women's Bible study group at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church. The women loved it and found in each chapter great comfort and inspiration to pray. I especially liked the final chapter, ""Your Prayer Life,"" because it addressed my needs the best. But I also loved the chapter on the prayer life of Samuel, which is called, ""Practice a Ministry of Prayer."" I highly recommend this book to a small or large group Bible study, or even to someone who wants to use it for personal daily devotion."
1,A joint Venture,"Louis L'Amour is a great western writer and Yul Brenner is a great actor. Something went wrong when this movie was made, it has no redeeming value. I suggest looking elsewhere for western movies that are well written and directed."
2,no to bad,I guess it was good to see Leonard Nimoy in something besides Star trek. This was too much like a spaghetti western. The actors lips didn't match the words. And I guess I just didn't really care for the movie.
4,"A horrible, bloody battle...and worth a read.","This book gives the reader who is not, and has not been a Marine, a sense of what makes these guys so great (as well as the Sea Bees, the Pharmacist's Mates, and other Navy personnel). This book lets you know how the Marines function. It brings the fighting on Iwo Jima to life. And, it is certainly amazing how many Medals of Honor were bestowed on so many during this battle. This book will certainly make you proud that we have the US Marines. The book is a tribute to those who sacrificed their lives so that we may have ours. Excellent."
2,An exhausting book of valor,"This book is maybe one of the most detail in describing stories in a battle. It is very interesting, but in can also be exhausting. We will find the same pattern throughout this book, the story of one man followed by another and followed by another. I found that this pattern is not comfortable. Above all, this book is a very good one, especially because pictures in it can tell us another stories. We can learn how crule it was there, worst than we have imagined."
3,Good but not great,A good account of the fight but not good enough to rivet my attention as some others.
5,A WWII Favorite,"This book evokes feelings as the reader tends to become personally involved with each individual's battle exploits. My father was at Iwo Jima with the 5th Marines. To show my respect and honor for him & all Veterans, I studied WWII for over thirty years. This book by Bill Ross is a personal favorte of a WWII Library of more than two hundred titles."
2,A bit of a dissapointment.,"After hearing Nightworks from Layo & Bushwacka, I bought this CD, All Night Long, hoping it was more of the same. Have to say I'm a bit disappointed. Perhaps this will grow on me."
2,Not very good,"Disc 1 is truly awful. They try to do some sort of old-skool tribute, but it's just unlistenable. Some of the samples are sped up to the point where it resembles ""Alvin & The Chipmunks."" Believe me, it's just horrible. Not something you'd want to listen to at work, in your car or even dance to at a club.Disc 2 is just ok, mixed well, but nothing really stands out. Don't waste your money on this sad excuse for a mix cd."
5,Household stuff defined!,This is an awesome pop up book. My 10 year old grandaughter was veryhappy to read about why we have some of the things we have in our housesand who and when they were invented. The adults present when I gave it to her were surprised at what THEY didn't know!
4,Peculiar,"This is a wonderful pop-up book for a 5 yr. old, which I wanted, but the writings are in very small print and interesting only for an adult. This seemed strange to me. Maybe it was intended that way. I would have thought the words would have been for an 8 or 9 yr. old who could enjoy both the pop-up house and the words.The book arrived in good time and in fine shape."
3,Not as good as I expected,I bought this book for my 5-year-old son.The letters are too small to read for young boys.The pop-up is not three-dimentional.He just read it once and left it behind.
5,"Fun, educational and interesting",This fun pop up book has educational and interesting facts printed on items in each room of the house. I highly recommend it for all ages.
5,A WARM FUZZY FOR THE HOLIDAYS,"I actually read this book after Christmas. Who has time before? But it got me in the holiday spirit all over again. If you're looking for a good warm story to make those holiday fires burn a little brighter, try Pam Bauer's book. I'm saving it to read next year again."
5,HAS BLOWN ME AWAY SINCE FIRST LISTEN!,"This cd knocked me off my feet quicker than any other that I've ever heard (the first time I heard Mercyful Fate shocked me more, but that was an underground demo tape, not a cd, so that doesn't count). Anyway, the technicality on this release amazes and the black/death metal vocals don't take away from the power by any means. This is the incredibly brilliant solo debut from Meshuggah's lead guitarist and it blows away anything ever released by Meshuggah, and it's sure to stay underground with such as cumbersome band name. ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL!"
5,don't like this? your a maggot,"this is what creativity is about, but it's not experimental b0ll0cks like so many experimental projects unfortunately are, the end result exceeds so much of the dross available and by so far that you need to hear this.I can understand how the other reviewer gave this one star, it just saddens me that I have to share this planet with them."
4,"Great review book, but know it thorougly","I just passed the 271 with an 899 and the 272 with a 916. This book was my only study resource, but I have been working with the XP OS on-the-job for four years.The difficulty of the test comes from Microsoft's method of testing. Even though I did very well, I only had ""warm fuzzies"" with half of the questions as I was taking the test, because they really run your brain through the wringer. So, you must understand why all of the other choices are clearly wrong and only one is right, and this entails knowing the material thoroughly.The only problems I had with the book are is the horrible amount of typos and strange program behavior with the practice tests, and the lack of anything other than multiple-choice questions.Other than that, get hands-on training, read this book over and over, and be careful with the wording of questions on the actual exams."
2,"Useless on the test, but good general reference","I have been in tech support for a decade, and picked up this book to cover the stuff my job does not. I drilled down on it, studied it, passed its practice tests with 80-90%And it was utterly USELESS when I showed up at the test site. It does not cover the run-line commands, does not cover nearly enough on installation questions or protocols. It's a great book for everything BUT what you need to pass."

2,Do not get this book none of the information in this book is covered on the exam,I would tell anyone that this book is not the one to get because everything youread in this book you will not have any thing on the exam no way like it nor any questions you study for will be on the exam. Don't get me wrong we all know that the same question from the book and the question from exam will not be the same but there should have been some examples as the same in which there wasn't any at all. Get another study guide for this test because this book is not the one.
1,Waste-o-time,"I failed both tests on first try, almost passed both though without studying. Failed both again on second attempt after serious studying with this book AND my scores were lower! The only way to pass these tests is to memorize the actual answers. Many of the test questions have 2 or more correct answers and the test-taker must memorize the test author's preferred answer. I did pass the A+ tests on first try without studying!"

5,Complete History of Brown County,"This is one of the most complete county histories I've ever seen. If you are a genealogist working on Brown County - you need this book! It is written by a local newspaperman who compiled events, mostly by year, of various events in the county. There are marriages, deaths, calamaties, successes, colored people,indian history - you name it. It doesn't have an index, but if you know the year you're looking for, you're set. There are small histories on notable people, some who did nothing but achieve 100 years of age. The book is filled with information!"
5,Nut Chopper,She loves it ! Much nicer and heavy duty compared to the one she wore out. If it only come out once a year for Christmas cookies it's worth it.
5,nut chopper,I had one of these before and I love it. This is the easiest and the best way to chop nuts for your recipes.
4,Nut Chopper,"Had a nut chopper for many years and had difficulty finding a new one, This is an excellent product, better than the old one since is has measurements. Also has two levels of chopping. Easy to clean and easy to use. Nice appearance."
1,Heavy Duty?,"The grinder will chop nuts coarsly on the fine setting, and deliver ""crashed"" nuts on the coarse setting. The top poorly attaches to the base and will come off during use. The top best is left half filled, otherwise the it will be hard to turn the handle (which, btw, is too small for comfortable use). You may consider putting your nuts into a Ziploc and having a go on them with a rolling pin instead of using this grinder."
2,loose top,"chopper works fine but top won't stay on because it doesn't have enough threads to twist on. only twist about 3/4's of a turn, would be excellent if it twisted on 1.5 turns, as it is when you chop and reverse the crank, the top comes off, at least it does for me. you have to hold the chopper where the top threads onto the bottom."
3,Nut Chopper,"I wish it had a provision for coarser chopping. The chopped nuts are too fine, even on the coarse position."
5,Excellent tool,I chose this nut chopper because I'm an amateur bread baker. I love to add chopped nuts and stuff to my bread because I think it adds character and uniqueness. However chopping these things is laborious. I tried the slap type chopper and it failed miserably. This chopper looked simpler and sturdier. It didn't let me down. I recommend it highly.
2,It worked for a while,"I bought this thing out of a catalog from my daughters school, around Christmas time. I was thrilled when I received it as I make Red Velvet Cakes as extra income. To say the least, one of the teeth or grinders actually broke off into the cake batter and baked in the cake. When the cake was served, one of my customers bit on the medal piece. She brought it to me furious. I compared it to the nut chopper and saw that one of the teeth were actually broke. Now, the customer has filed a lawsuit against me, and I am in turn, filing a lawsuit against the manufacturer. So say the least, business has not been the same."
1,metal teeth broke off on two grinders,"I bought this nut grinder because it looked comfortable and competent. The second time I used it, two of the metal chopping teeth broke off and I discovered them while eating (luckily I discovered them with my tongue before I broke one of my own teeth). Progressive sent me a new one and again the second time I used it a metal tooth broke off (this time I checked for missing chopper teeth before mixing into the cranberry salad). The nuts were Haselnuts, which admittedly are not soft, but it's supposed to be a NUT Chopper. I can't recommend this chopper for anything other than chopping very soft nuts, and even then I'd feel nervous. Heavy Duty it most certainly is not."
1,"Makes nut powder, not chopped nuts","This thing is useless. I ran some walnuts through it on its ""coarse"" setting, and most of what came out the bottom was powder; the rest were tiny, tiny pieces. Those pieces were far smaller than I'd want to use in brownies, and to use them even for that, it would be necessary to sift out the powder first"
1,Inadequate to the task,"I needed almonds ground to a fine consistency for a Christmas recipe. At best, this thing makes almond chunks maybe a couple of millimeters in diameter, even in the ""fine"" direction."
1,Chops too small,I wish I could find a nut chopper that chops pecans into like 4-5 pieces instead of chopping them into smitherines! I own 3 nut choppers and they all chop nuts into very tiny pieces and then there are lots of crumbs too. Not what I was looking for.
4,convenient for quick nut chopping,"Whenever I have a recipe that requires some nut chopping, I whip out this chopper and I find it quicker to do then to take out the blender. It is a little difficult to turn the crank if you disconnect the base. If you have this problem just leave it intact as shown in the picture and crank-away!I would highly recommend this product."
4,"Good Product, better than most","It works well, easy to hold, clean etc. I had an older version and after seeing a magazine review of this one decided to try it. It does seem to work better, and the jar is definately bigger. It's such a simple tool, that I can't wax on too much. It works, the price is right. It's a good tool to have."
4,Nut Chopper (grinder),"This is a great product for the price but it tends to grind the nuts rather than chop them. I can't get medium size pieces, only small, or real small, which it works very well for."
3,It works,I bought this for work where we make several pecan pies daily and we needed a quick way to chop pecans. This device chops the pecans a little too small for what we wanted. Its also a little difficult to turn because the blades aren't sharp inside. It basically forces the pecans between small metal openings with teeth.
1,Poor quality,"The ring at the bottom of the top chamber, which also holds the chopping blade mechanism in place, separated from the top chamber after only about two weeks of use. Thus, the nut chopper is useless. I was also unimpressed by the cutting blades; they must be using a highly inferior version of metal in the newer models. I would love to buy a nut chopper as good as my old one; this is not it. Almonds and walnuts were chopped with very little effort for years until the old one was dropped and the glass broke."
2,Can't find anything better...,"I researched all the nut choppers available on the market and bought this one. I didn't put mine in the dishwasher, but still, after about 10 uses, the top section detached from the bottom section. Enter the super glue. It's holding and I've continued to use it, but on the last use, I was getting down to the last of my pecans and I noticed that one of the metal blades looked a little shorter. It broke off in my nuts!!! What if I hadn't noticed and had put the nuts in my muffin batter? Yikes. I just can't find a good quality product. Help!"
2,more like Not Heavy Duty,I got this chopper 2 yrs ago. I loved it for the first year. I liked the measuring cup and the fine or course chop feature. After a year of use the plastic ring that screws onto the cup cracked. I will buy another when it is made out of steal.
5,really like this gadget,"I purchased this appox. 14 months ago almost didn't due to negative reviews,but very glad I did.It is handy and much easier on hands than the""smash"" kind of chopper.Never had a problem with any part of it,and I use it regularly,and the price was good."
5,Great for small projects.,Great chopper. Love the rubber on the bottom and the larger handle.Also the clear-plastic top helps see how much left to chop.
2,wasn't impressed...,"Trying to find something that will grind walnuts for a walnut torte my mom used to make 25 years ago is turning out to be frustrating,,,I've tried coffee grinders [turns the nuts into peanut butter].....I've hunted down 'Mall-type cooking boutiques...I've asked the bakery lady if she'll grind me some [I'll pay for the service] that I purchased from the store.....she told me just bang 'em' with a rolling pin...My mother had one of those silver clamp-on the edge types with a wood block to press on the nuts while you turn the handle...man that worked great...can't seem to find 'em'. So in desperation I get this...and it doesn't give the fine ground consistency needed...very unimpressed.....most of my efforts resulted in small bits of walnuts which did go into the cake...[no choice]. I'm left to no other recourse except to order ground walnuts on line or grab hold of the rolling pin...and start banging away."
5,Great gadget,"I used this for all of my grinding needs, from nuts to pretzels. I have used this gadget for many years."
1,Excellent but dangerous,"Chops nuts better and easier than food processor or slap chopper, and cleans easier.But sooner or later, a blade will break off and fall into the chopped nuts. It will be about a half inch long, sharp and dangerous. Unless you examine the chopped nuts very carefully, it will end up in your food and then in your mouth."
2,Nuts to this product,"I purchased this after seeing it pronounced the winner of a product test on the TV show America's Test Kitchen. I planned to use it to coarsely chop walnuts for granola and baked goods, and to prepare nuts to toast for salads. This product has both a ""coarse"" and a ""fine"" option, selected by the direction you turn the handle.The ""coarse"" option results in about half walnut meal and half very tiny pieces of nuts. I tried it three times: with walnuts at room temperature, refrigerated, and frozen. In all cases, I had to sieve the ground walnuts in order to get any pieces that could be used, and thus I threw out about half. Haven't bothered to try the ""fine"" option as anything finer would be walnut flour.I'm really disappointed with the performance. Back to the cutting board and chef's knife method."
2,Picky,Much smaller than expected and cheap material gives a feeling that it may easily break. But anyway the product works as described.
3,Not like the old days,"I owned an item just like this years ago. I have been looking for a replacement for a while and finally found this one just before thanksgiving. I used it to chop pecans for several recipes. While it did a great job a chopping (fast, evenly chopped) the construction of the product seemed a little flimsy. The top did not screw on very well and as a result kept popping off in the middle of my chopping. I was hesitant to tighten the top too much as it seemed like the plastic might break or strip if i went too far. I do like the rubberized bottom and top. The bottom helps to keep the base from slipping or moving too much. Decent and I will use it again but just not like the old days."
3,Heavy Duty- Don't Bet On It.,"Have used half dozen times and it chops fairly well-a lot faster and neater than a knife and the twist off measuring cup is nice. Works fine on pecans and walnuts. Not sure the blades will handle almonds-but haven't tried yet, but judging from the way they look and action with pecans, the nuts may jam or bend the blades so check other reviews before you buy if you plan is to chop heavyer nuts"
2,Good while it lasted,"This thing was perfect for grinding up a half or cup of nuts in a hurry. I mostly used it on almonds and pistachios for our salads. I had another brand but the blades all bent over. This had stronger blades, but after a couple months the plastic part where the threads are cracked from screwing it on and off. Why can't someone make something that lasts. I would pay extra for a metal threaded top attachment. Built in plastic obsolescence."
5,Best Manual Chopper You Can Buy,"This is the second Progressive International Heavy Duty Nut Chopper that I've purchased. I have one back home--bought three years ago--and I needed another for my Florida residence. The handle is easy to use, and the unit is very easy to clean. It does a good job even with almonds, which are very hard, along with the pecans and walnuts. My husband and I are very health conscious, and we include nuts in our daily diet--both at breakfast time (on our cereal) and also in the evening, mixed in with our salad. Electric choppers tend to pulverize nuts, making them akin to breadcrumbs, so all nut eaters need a hand chopper, as well; this one is the best."
4,Chopper check,"Used this nut chopper regularly over several months to grind up about 1400 walnut kernels from a tree in my backyard. The non-skid base will only keep the chopper stable while grinding if you don't pack up the top portion with too many nuts (you may have to hold the unit down with your other hand anyway). If there's a difference between ""coarse"" and ""fine"" for walnuts, I haven't seen it, so I just use the handle in both directions to expedite chopping and save time."
4,Strickly Nut Chopping,"I love this nut chopper. It's a lot better than those choppers made for some vegatables and nuts. I prefer the crank to the pounding. Plus when I orderd it just before the holidays, it arrived the very next day,"
4,Works great for the price,"Easy to use. Worth the price. Have used it several times, even on frozen macadamia nuts. Cleans up easily in dishwasher."
3,Great untill,"This is a very good nut chopper that grinds the nuts either fine or course depending on which way you turn the crank. My wife loves it and uses it all the time. The problem is that when you tighten the top to the bottom , it is easy to turn it past the end if the threads causing the parts to come apart again. We have been very careful about this but it keeps getting harder to know when to stop. Now the threads are worn slick and it will not tighten at all without putting a piece of foil around the threads. Yes we will buy another one hoping this one just happen to have a flaw. If we have the same problem we will return it as soon as we see we get it."
4,It Works,"""Heavy duty"" seems an overstatement, since the device struggles a bit with almonds. I wish it were made of glass to give it some weight and hold it in place, but all in all it does chop nuts."
4,Does the job I bought it for,"All in all, I am happy with my purchase. It does the job and although I wouldn't mind a finer grind, it works nicely for the cake I needed it for.Added a pic of walnuts before and after, hope this will help you decide if it works for you.A few comments:- You'd like this more if you're left handed. The finer grind comes from a counter-clock rotation.- Had to grind each cup 3 times to get the desired granularity. Easy to do, just turn the thing over. The top cap falls off easily, so be careful. I spilled twice, enough to make a mini-mess on the floor.- Very easy to clean. I washed it with a tooth brush specially purposed for such needs- I wish it would have come in a storage box. Not sure how resistant it is to dropping or knocking over. I will get a box to keep it in.- I used it just once but it fells sturdy enough, if not thrown around. I will probably use it for ""softer"" nuts, wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't grid the harder ones."
1,Heavy Duty Breakdown,"Heed these warnings my fellow consumer and from one who did not do so in time let me say this ""heavy"" (ha) duty grinder fell apart after only a moderate amount of use - stripping the top storage area from the ground bottom section making it virtually useless (maybe I can convert it into a fly catcher?) ugh...avoid!"
1,Disappointing purchase,"I had my sister order this for me when she was placing an order of her own. If it was in my own name I would return it. I wanted this because I had read reviews how it didn't leave nut ""crumbs"". Well that is basically what I have after grinding 1/2 cups walnut halves. I used as directed for coarsely chopped nuts and thought maybe they had the instructions backwards. No, it chopped even finer on fine. The only advantage to this nut chopper is that the crumbs you don't want are not scattered all over the cutting board. I am sure I have fewer crumbs when I chop with my knife. Big disappointment!!"
1,Cheap product!,"I bought this product to replace a really great grinder I had for 30 years. It was glass and eventually, the glass portion broke. I liked this grinder at first. I loved how easy it is to chop, the portion marks on the bottom half, and really liked the non-skid surface. However, within approximately 2 weeks of use, the rim holding the top portion to the bottom broke. It literally fell apart chopping pecans. The handle was good, the blades were sturdy...but the thread portion cannot handle simple pecans. I'm looking for a new one now!"
3,Pretty good,"This nut chopper does, indeed, chop nuts, and quickly and easily. I would have liked to find that the nut pieces were fairly uniform in size. In fact it yields a range of sizes, with say 20% in a fine powder and 80% in nice-sized chunks. I tried sharpening the tangs, but the result is the same. So satisfactory, but not as good (and not as time-consuming) as taking each nut and cutting it with a sharp knife.Given the price, it is a very good deal. One can always filter the result to take only the larger pieces for a demanding recipe or garnish (and use the dust somewhere else)."
4,OK,"I bought this for making baklava, I needed a little chopper for the walnuts. The fine setting doesn't work as well as I would like, and when I turn it upside down the nuts don't seem to go through the chopper very well. Overall, not bad for the price."
2,Needs improvement,At first glance it appeared handy. However...I tried to chop choc chips and while turning the handle the top snapped off from the bottom. There are not enough screw rotations to securely attach the lid to the bottom. I would not buy this again. Not a sturdy item.
5,Keeps getting better and better!,"xxxHolic just keeps getting better and better. While last volume we saw a major progression with the plot with Yuko battling a mysterious villian's quest, here we get some BIG personal development between Watanuki and Domeki with heaps of romantic suggestions and Watanuki actually being forced to ponder what Domeki means to him.It also becomes apparent that Yuko ""hired"" Domeki for a much greater reason that simply to repay a fee. Several characters mention or speculate on Domeki's destiny and where he's headed with in becoming obvious that big changes are instore for him in future volumes (having seen the next volume in Japanese I can say this is definitly the case!).The art is of course first class and I simply loved the translation notes in the back (5 pages!). This manga continues to educate me in the Japanese language and culture.5+ stars for this baby!"
3,O blasted cliffhanger!,"CLAMP, xxxHolic vol. 6 (Del Rey, 2005)Will Yuko stop at nothing to get liquor? This time she ropes Watanuki and Domeki into attending a spirit parade in order to collect nectar. The second episode concerns a woman grieving for her son, who would be Watanuki's age, and the friendship that forms between the two of them. Uncharacteristic cliffhanger ending for this volume, so get your hands on vol. 7 at the same time. ***"
3,Some what of an Outkast!!!,"Very African. As an old white guy, gotta say several songs are really good. First time I heard ""Hey, ya'll"" I said what??Had too buy the whole package to get a few songs. Well it's funny, great music, the parts you can call music. I would recommend to adults. NO, children or young adults."
1,Defective Product,Video will not play. Defective. Please replace. It will play for a minute or so and then stop. This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I was so looking forward to finally having it on DVD. I am so disappointed.
3,Northwest Passage DVD,This DVD is pretty good quality considering the age of the film.I enjoyed watching it since you will never again see it on TV. It will satisfy fans of this Great Classic until a Blu-Ray DVD is released.
3,"Great Film, Disappointing Presentation","While I bow to no one in my admiration of Warner's Archive series, which has brought to light many minor and esoteric films from the MGM and Warner Bros. libraries, ""Northwest Passage"" is neither minor nor esoteric. This is a full-fledged major classic which warrants a complete restoration, not the simple remastering that this disc received. The disc, as it is, is badly in need of color correction. In order to achieve correct flesh tones, I had to go to the extreme with the green levels on my set. Also, the individual film elements of the Technicolor print have shrunken and are out of register. This is a great film and Warners is a great company when it comes to going the extra mile on it's special editions: hopefully, ""Northwest Passage"" will be better served in the future. Until then, this will have to do."
2,Classic Movie on DVD,"It's really an old movie, ""Northwest Passage"" with Spencer Tracy, which may be why the images are not always clear and sharp......especially apparent during many movement/action sequences. All that being said, and considering the price I paid which was well in excess of $30.00, the quality is less than what I had hoped for."
1,no satisfaction yet,"i have yet to see this video yet. the first disc was defective,i returned and you sent a second. the second was defective also. i sent it back 5 days ago and have yet to see a replacement that was shipped if one was or a credit,this second disc is still in limbowould like feed back on this problem."
4,Spencer Tracy at his best.,"Another 73 year old classic that I had on LazerDisc but was awaiting a DVD version. THough not studio remastered it still looked decent on my old 65"" rear projection TV upgraded by my latest BluRay player. Spencer Tracy was a huge star when he made this movie and is in top form. I'd love to see a digitally remastered version but this one will suffice for now. Directed by KIng Vidor the camera work is cutting edge for the time. I highly recommend this classic."
1,EXPECTATIONS NOT MET,"1. This is a film I've waited years to see come out on DVD.2. When I ordered on Amazon, I mistakenly ordered the version for KINDLE, thinking it was a DVD.3. Since I almost never use my kindle, unless travelling, I had misplaced it and it took awhile to even find it, charge it, etc. Once charged, I downloaded the video.4. Quality was very poor. I don't know if it a function of the Kindle's processing power or the movie itself, but the are frequent periods throughout the movie wher the scenes go out of focus. This is really annoying.I will never download a video unless I can be positive the reproduction quality is up to standards; this clearly was not."
4,Pettidee comes through hard with this new release!,"I am a big fan of all christian rap and Pettidee is one of the best artists out there. His first cd ""Still Alive"" was good, but this is a whole lot better. Songs like ""Blood Shed"" and ""Minister"" really tell it like it is, while songs like ""Static"" and ""Nah,nah(that's the hook)"" definantly give the album a more upbeat feel. I give it 4 stars because it lacks a great song like ""Devil gets dropped"" on Still Alive,but I would definantly recommend it to any fan of christian rap or just rap in general."
2,AWESOME!! and I *mean* it!!!!!,"5 stars!!!I was at first a little doubtful of this unknown artist Pettidee when I first heard of him, but I took a wild chance and got his latest CD, Street Music, from Amazon. And it was truly a blessing. It is hard to describe the awesome flow, lyrical raps, and positive messages that can be derived from this incredible CD. To put its superiority into perspective, I have various Christian Rap CD's, including, Verbs, Kj-52, Grits, Cross Movement, Da TRUTH, and many others. And, believe it or not, IMHO, this OWNS all the other CD's. Quite simply, it is tighter that any Christian rap I've ever heard. HIGHLY recommended for any collection. You will be surprised at how good Pettidee is. GET THID CD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!! Of course, this could all be just a huge opinion, but trust me, no matter what, you are going to love this CD."
2,Very Disappointed,"I enjoyed his first album, so I thought I would be loyal and give this one a try. I will not lie and tell someone to spend money on this one. Only 2 or 3 tracks hit hard and right away."
2,Sherrie,The book was not as practical as I had hoped in ways to implement skills...it was more of a touchy feely approach to her personal biography-type experiences.
4,The book aptly fulfills its full title,"""To Lead Is To Serve: How To Attract Volunteers & Keep Them,"" is well written, moving logically from one point to the next as it lays out a number of practical keys to leadership in a volunteer organization and to attracting and keeping volunteers. Its counsel applies, however, to leadership in other than volunteer organizations and to leadership in general. A good book on leadership from an author who began a complete novice but now has and writes from extensive successful experience in leading volunteer organizations of various types. The principles listed can be put to practical use immediately."
2,Fascinating subject derailed by self-indulgent author,"This is totally the sort of book I'd go for: arcane and quirky. I adore the subject. Yet Harvey's hopeless writing makes a mess of things. I beg to differ with the review who calls this book ""exquisitely written."" It's full of verbiage, hyperbolic prose, overstuffed with description, and it just gets on your nerves. Case in point: ""the winds of doom seemed to be shrieking through that library, swirling and shrieking."" A tad melodramatic, maybe? Just maybe?Just when Harvey starts sticking to his subject, and the story gets interesting again, he derails it with some self-indulgent, totally uninteresting discussion of his personal life, or waxes eloquent about Greek myth. You can seem him trying to be snappy and catchy with his prose, but it just end up as useless melodrama.Obviously the author has a knack for finding good stories, but he needs to take himself less seriously as a writer, because he's not nearly as good as he thinks he is."
3,I got lost...,"The Island of Lost Maps is a very ambitious book. Miles Harvey uses the art, science and history that surrounds cartography to explore and try to understand the motivations and pyschology of Gilbert Bland, a relatively notorious map thief. There's a lot of interesting information covered in this book as Miles Harvey explores the importance of maps and their meanings to us.However I found Harvey's exploration wandered all over, as he tried to get closer to the real Gilbert Bland. Like another reviewer I was also a little disappointed that the book descended into his own personal reflections and analysis. So while certain passages were extremely interesting, others were well, bland!I was attracted to this book by a fantastic review, and found it interesting, but because of the high expectations finished a little disappointed. Explore at will, just don't expect El Dorado..."
3,"Not great, but OK if you like the subject matter.","Too many sidetracked stories about himself. He talks about a huge collection of Bland files, but not very much is written about him. I would have liked to have seen what he had collected on Bland over the four years he said it took him to write this book.Also, he mentions other map thiefs but only in very brief. One paragraph on each. He probably could have written about those other contemporary map thiefs instead of writing about himself and his travels and trials & tribulations related to writing the book."
3,Island of Lost Maps,"The best parts of this book are the insights into the map making business - one that I know very little about. However, given that the author was not able to interview Bland, all of the author's conjecture about the crimes and Bland's motives seriously weakened the book for me."
3,Interesting even if ultimately unpersuasive,"This book is one man's meandering through the world of maps, map collecting, and ultimately map stealing and selling. There's lost of interesting information here, written in a plain style that holds your attention but thats about it. The story of the map thief at the book's heart is ultimately unpersuasive and is, in my view, the weakest part of the book. But you get a lot of interesting information about maps, map makers, and maps along the way. And I liked the Island of Lost Maps seen as a brother to the mythical islands often shown on ancient maps.Not the greatest book in the world, but you learn a lot about maps!"
4,More a journey than a destination,"I just finished reading Island of the Maps. It took me several days to read, but every time I put it down, I kept looking for opportunities to pick it back up again. While the theft of historical maps from major universities and libraries by Gilbert Brand is, on the surface, the foundation of the book, I found the subject of the magic that maps work on the psyche to much more intriguing part of this story.This isn't a ""true crime"" story, and if that's what you are looking for, I think you'll be disappointed. But if you are intrigued by the history of maps, the kinds of people who are passionate about maps, and how maps (those cartographic masterpieces as well as those that are purely mental) can take you on all kinds of journeys, then I think you'll enjoy this book. I loved the history of it, the psychology of it, and although Gilbert Bland remains a mystery, I enjoyed the journey of discovering Miles Harvey through it all."
5,Absolutely fascinating book! Better than a novel!,"Even if you have no interest in maps or rare map collecting or rare books, you'll love this book. You get caught up in the story and want to finish it in one sitting. A fascinating read about a world I'm not familiar with. If you like to read mystery novels, this is the kind of true story you'll like. I most highly recommend it!"
1,A plodding journey through a formulaic plot.,"The plot and premise were interesting and they probably made a great magazine article, which is where the author started his 'journey.' He should have stayed there. The author uses map and travel metaphors over and over again in this tale. We are on a journey. He is charting territory. He is trying to fill in the blank areas. He is Columbus. He is Humboldt. He is Fremont. He is tired and boring. The analogies become predictable and tedious to the point where they feel contrived and formulaic. Every chapter followed the same cartographic format. Why the predictable repetition? Lack of imagination perhaps. Perhaps this is what comes naturally when you try to stretch a thin magazine article into a novel."
1,calling all editors!,"Grab this embarassingly overwritten book by its cover and shake it vigorously. Perhaps then all the excess verbiage (potted history and pop psychology) will fall to the floor and you'll have a readable story. But then you won't have much more than an entertainig magazine piece and you'll be as angry as I am for having paid full book price for this unedited, overwritten excuse for a book. Where do I get my money back?"
2,A good editor could have made this an excellent 100 pg. book,"This book went off track so many times; by the end, I was able to just sense what paragraphs I could skip completely in order to keep some kind of narrative flow going. The author's description of his own obsession, his fantasies about ghosts of librarians past,and his assumptions about Gilbert Bland's history took away from solid information he did have. I learned some about map collecting and the industry, and I enjoyed that. That, along with a description of the crime and its affect on the industry would have made an excellent read."
5,For the love of collecting,"What a tremendously researched book! I have not come across an author who delved so deeply before in order to get all the facts for one book. The historical details on how maps came to be and how maps have progressed is phenomenal. I was utterly fascinated by the entire book. It was so engrossing I could hardly put it down. I learned so much and I could relate so well with the hunt for a treasured item. As I was reading I wanted to holler at the author and tell him he was on his own hunt and not to give up. It wasn't until almost the end of the book before Miles Harvey finally admitted he was, like a collector of maps, deeply hooked on finding that one item that would make his collection complete; And that was why James Bland stole all those maps. He never found it but I doubt he'll ever stop asking why and hoping someday James Bland will reveal his secret."
4,Immensely enjoyable,"You don't usually buy a book by its cover, but the cover is the first reason I picked it up from the shelf. As an avid 'map buff' I was intrigued by it, so I decided to buy it even though I don't usually read true crime stories. I was not dissapointed. This book tells a fascinating story of the history of map making and the history of map collecting, all the while being led by the story of Gilbert Bland, the map thief. I highly recomend this book to anyone intersted in maps and map making!"
1,Story could have been written in 10 pages,Diverges from the main point for about 300 pages. I kept reading out of hope that I would find out what happened to the map thief. Only bought the book because it was on clearance - a total waste of a $1.99.
2,"Harvey tries to write like Tony Horwitz, but can't","Many of the reviews here have this book pegged; too much truly uninteresting information about the author, reads like a padded-out book report, needs better editing. You get the idea that Harvey would like to have written a book like ""Confederates in the Attic""; breezy, informative, filled with quirky people, and with honest and provocative insights by the author. Harvey doesn't seem to have it in him. ""The Island of Lost Maps"" is, by comparison, plodding, not so informative, populated by almost no quirky people, and too full of the author's pompous navel-gazing. The only parts that were interesting related to Bland, and the piecing together of his extended life of map crime. Stay away from this one."
1,Interesting Magazine Article Turned Into Weak Book,"Remember when you were in the fourth grade and the teacher assigned you a book report? It had to be 500 words long but you only had 200 words to say, so you really, really, really padded it? And you took out all contractions because they only counted as one word instead of two?This book is like that report. What was an interesting magazine article has been inflated beyond recognition or interest into this book-lenth effort. Maybe Harvey saw fellow ""Outside"" writers turn their articles into terrific books (""Into Thin Air"" and ""Perfect Storm"") and he thought he could do the same. He couldn't."
1,Disappointing,"I found this book to be poorly written. It did not hold my interest at all. It leads you to believe the book will be about the map thief himself, but it never really answers the questions that are posed.Don't waste your time."
4,Getting lost in Baltimore,"This is the story of a map thief--Gilbert Bland--who cut maps out of rare books in libraries all over the country. He finally got caught at the Peabody Library in Baltimore in 1995. Much of the book is about maps and map making in general; little is about Bland who refuses to talk. Most interesting to me was how Bland got away with it so long: apparently famous university libraries refused to acknowledge the fact that someone had rifled their books, going into complete denial, thus never reporting thefts when they occurred. Amazin'."
2,Island of Lost Maps,"I was drawn to the book due to a review in the NY Times. It had two key elements that I find very interesting, cartography and collecting, add to that mystery and intrigue and I was sold. I specifically checked reviews here on Amazon.Com and decided it was a worthwhile read. As previously reviewed, the first two-thirds of the book were very good, presented in a interesting and educational fashion. The last third was absolutly painful. The author drags us through an almost surreal look at his trials and tribulations in his pursuit of an answer, when all I was looking for was a decent conclusion."
2,A minor disappointment,"As a map collector I looked forward to this book but wound up disappointed. Harvey's writing is sophmoric at worst and average at best. He loses track of the thread of the story and rambles on about Graham Arader (who evidently snowed Harvey and got some free press). He sheds very little light on the map thief himself, but rehashes old newspaper articles and really does not come up with anything new. The book is physically unattractive, but that is not his fault. The author tries to personalize the quest but that device is so strained that it is not worthy of a freshmen English essay. The book's redeeming feature is that it brings awareness of map theft to the greater public and perhaps next time Gilbert Bland (the thief) will not get off so lightly."
4,"Interesting historical information, crime comes in second","Until I read some of the other reviews here, I was unaware that this was a ""True Crime"" book. I really enjoyed the historical information in the book and thought that the modern day crime story added some interest, particularly because it brought into play the value of antique maps in todays market.I also felt that the ease with which Mr. Bland (truly a perfect name for him)was able to remove maps and other documents from public institutions points to a severe problem in local libraries and historical societies. These, often underfunded, institutions lack the money for everyday expenses, much less high tech security systems. What is to prevent their collections from ending up on e-bay? Not much if you follow this story.Mr. Bland may not have been the interesting character some readers may desire, but the historical information and the importance maps hold in history is facinating."
3,Curate's egg,"This book covers the fascinating history of map collecting. But the author tries to do too much: combining interesting interviews with collectors and dealers with a crime chase for a map thief, and personal quests as well. As a result, he loses track of where he is and includes irrelevant detail. Fun if you are a map enthusiast, but otherwise a little disappointing."
2,I MADE A MISTAKE,"I READ THIS BOOK A FEW WEEKS AGO AND THOUGHT I HAD IT PEGGED, BECAUSE I AM A COLLECTOR, AND THE SUBJECT OF THE THEFTS HAD SOME INTEREST. BUT THEN, AFTER, I THOUGHT MORE ABOUT IT AND DECIDED, THE AUTHOR CANNOT GET INTO THE MIND OF MR. BLAND, BECAUSE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE. HE WAS A POOR THIEF AND A DULL MAN. THE FACT THAT HE GOT AWAY WITH IT FOR SOME TIME IS A COMMENT ON THE LIBRARIES, NOT ON HIM. I COULD NOT CARE LESS. THE AUTHOR WOULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO CONCENTRATE ON THE COLLECTING."
2,Disappointed,"You'll run across a couple of great characters throughout the book, my favorite was Mr. Atlas the map collector, and they are interesting and fun. I also liked the part about what happened to Columbus after his first, highly acclaimed voyage. But I found the author's phsyco babble about himself intrusive and it put me off. In the end, although his pursuit of the story behind the thefts took him on some interesting detours, he was basically unsuccessful in finding out anything about Bland or the thefts beyond what was reported in the newspapers in 100 words or less. And come on - the Island of Lost Maps is a pile of paper in the middle of a table? That was weak. I think the title is misleading and raises expectations that it can't fulfill."
1,Boring,This movie could sit on the shelf and never be seen and no one would complain. Terrible movie with poor acting. The future of these actors/actresses is porn.
2,B movie fun,Movie was decent but definitely not worth paying for. If you have cable watch it on Showtime or whatever channel it happens to be playing on.
1,Utterly flat acting and cliched plot ruin this thing,"Some kids pull a prank on Tamara and she winds up dead, comes back from the grave all [...]-looking and sporting supernatural powers. Boredom and lots of lifeless acting ensue.The acting in this is some of the worst I've seen, and I watch a whole lot of these low budget horror movies. Nobody has any actual personality whatsoever, they've all got an ""attitude"", and that's pretty much the entire breadth and width of their performances. I couldn't care less if they all lived or died. This keeps the interest level at precisely zero, and that's about all I've got to say about this stinky waste of time.5"
4,Great Script Elevates This One,"This is head-and-shoulders above most direct to video horror for the simple reason that they seem to have started with a great script. How often do you see character-driven horror? Great ending, and great performances by the two female leads. Definitely recommended."
4,Bad horror movie...but in a fun way,"If you like B-horror and bad movies you might want to give this one a try. The plot is cliche but in a campy sort of way: Geeky unpopular girl is into witchcraft, has a crush on her teacher and puts an evil love spell on him. Then she gets killed by mean classmates. She comes back from the dead unharmed and a super sexy vixen as if nothing happened. As we might expect, she wants revenge and then things go horribly wrong, etc, etc. If you like sexy and insane girls you will love this movie!"
3,Tamara,"Tamara is an OK movie, She is beautiful before and after,the movie was filmed in Canada(B-Movie) that tells you it's not great/direct to video. The story I have seen before, not original. but it's entertaining. not scary but worth to watch which you can on Hulu or youtube movies section."
5,Can't help singing along,"Old 97's are one of the best and most versatile of the alt. country bands, and this is one cd that keeps making it into the rotation of my home cd player and car stereo. ""Waiting For The Other Shoe To Fall"" is full of nasty menace tinged with heartbreak, and ""W-I-F-E"" sounds like it's been played in honky-tonks for 60 years. Can't say enough about this band--they are joy."
1,The worst s**t ever,Buy this if you're looking for a reason to plunge an ice pick into your ears to stop the screeching junk that is coming from your speakers while this is in your CD player.Who decided this should be called music?
5,Help for the Grieving.,"It helps to read stories from others who are going through the grief of losing a child, (my son), as I did. Everyone grieves differently. I know this first hand because my husband & I have handled dealing with our grief so differently, as did our daughters. Reading others thoughts and realities helped me realize you have got to grieve in your own way, and that is ok. This is a book that I would definitely recommend to others."
5,When The Bough Breaks,Bought this book for my sister-in-law and brother-in-law who lost their daughter two years ago this coming December. This book came highly recommended to me.
5,When the Bough Breaks,Excellent book to read if you have lost a child or know someone who has. Helped to understand what I was feeling and what to expect.
1,Not for men,"I lost both of my children when they were very young. A grief counsellor gave me this book. I'm sure that a grieving mother would get help from this book. I won't sit and read a book that does nothing but put the grieving father down. The author makes men out to be not compassionate and uncaring. If you are a grieving father, this sexist book should not belong on your reading list."
3,The authors beliefs,"I thought the book was very good,in that it gave insite what other parents were feeling.My 33 year old son was killed 8 months ago in a tragic fire truck accident,he was a hero during Hurricane Katrina,left a 4 yr. old son,he was just a wonderful human being in every way.The only thing that helps me understand any of this,is that he still exists in a different dimension,that I will see him again.But when this very intellegent author,said her belief is when your dead your dead,and she has no belief in an afterlife.This is something that I don't want to hear."
3,Less than I expected,"If you are looking for 15 buildings, this might be good for you.All the accessories are cast metal, which can be painted. They make their list look lengthy however some items are broken down to the component level like the trailer for example- They state ""trailer"" but they also have a list of components which are die cast pieces that must be assembled and painted to become a trailer.The so called ""lights"" are not actually lights but die cast metal pieces. I was disappointed with this. They should tell you they don't actually light up.If I had to do it over, I would have purchased all the buildings I want separately. That way I get what I want. For example the ""hotel"" is an old 50's style 5 story downtown brick hotel, not what you might imagine for a hotel.It is a nice kit overall but not much savings as compared to purchasing separately."
4,Good job,"Pete does a good job of breaking down Gord's songs. I would have made a fewdifferent choices of songs, but with such a vast catalog, one can't quibble."
5,At size 50K I need some help,"This is well put together and a delight to wear. One of the few styles that goes up to a large cup size. This can cover and by using theAs Seen on TV - The Ultimate Bra Strap Solution Perfect Concealer Clips - Cleavage Control - 6 Pack Plus Body Tapeto bring the straps together in the back I get the extra lift a large pair needs. Love the flower pattern on the cups, too."
5,Great as a Beading Organizer,"My boyfriend bought this for me to use to organize all my beading. The top section is big enough for all of my pliers, and I chose to put my wire and other ""tools"" up there as well, and there's still room!The four removable storage sections are great, although please note on the changable plastic dividers, not all of them fit snuggly, but there are plenty enough of them, so tossing a few isn't the end of the world."
2,Not a good Buy at any price,I bought this box to replace an aged tackle box but found it cheaply made and awkward to use. Maybe OK for hobby stuff but it wont hold up for serious fishing latches are cheap and always popping open
3,Plano 3650 Tackle Box,"Great box but usless for my needs. The compartments come partially preset which takes away from it's flexability. I purchased the item to store my art supplies which come in a 7 inch length. There is no way to meet these measurements because of the preset molded layout. The longest option to set the storage trays at is much smaller than 7 inches. The description leads you to believe that you can set this up to your own desired sizes, but neglects to inform you that it already has perset molded dividers that can not be changed. This would have been perfect if it had been adaptable to meet my need for 7 inch spaces. I'm giving it a 3 star for it's lack of actual size description."
5,"Great product, a little small","The box is very good, very steady and well built. The only drawback I saw was that it was just a little too small for my intended use. I highly recommend and will get a larger one later."
5,tackle box,Bought this for my husband for fathers day and we just love it. Love all the space it has. Easy to get to where we need to.
5,An Excellent Storage Solution for Anything With Lots of Small Parts,"This product is fantastic. The transparent trays alleviate the need to label everything and, since the trays latch independently, you're able to take just the tray you need and leave the rest of the box should you so desire. The removable dividers within the trays allow for scalability unseen in most competitors' products and the top compartment provides space for items too large for the trays, all in a relatively light-weight case."
4,Varity at your fingertips,"I purchased this as part of my starter kit to get back into fishing and it has worked out great. You have lots of storage space, enough dividers to carry a wide variety of artificial bait, hooks weights, etc. The top lid gives you plenty of room to throw in a box of crickets or worms, extra line, tools, etc. on your way out to the lake. It's all strong plastic so if you happen to use any scents or scented baits and they get into the compartments, you can just pull everything out and wash it. Well worth the money."
2,"Potential in an interesting topic, but didn't quite meet expectations","This was a very quick read following the lives of several young women in 1830s China. There's some interweaving of their experiences, but the characters seem mostly two-dimensional. A lot of the book is striaght-forward narrative, which is fine, but the plot seemed largely simplistic and underdeveloped. There was potential for a lot more - greater depth in understanding some of the key characters (including the women who were not spinsters) and some of the historical events taking place in this period of time."
4,The Moon Pearl,"The book was very interesting, kind of like reading about the Women's Movement, but in the 1800s in China."
3,touching love story entwined in family struggle,I enjoyed watching this young man and woman as they developed a romance while trying to cope with their own personal family's problems. Each coming from different yet similarly difficult backgrounds with a fledgling brother. Their attraction builds into a loving relationship that dreams are made of. The intensity of their passion comes upon you and makes you wish you were Jada or Allen. It also pulls you into the danger that both brothers become invloved in. The danger that eventually envelopes them both. Can their love transcend their struggle??
1,Very Bad Quality DVD,"Rating based on Quality of the DVD and not the movie itself.Jason's Lyric is a great movie, that screams for a new release, as the MGM DVD is of horrible video quality,and seems to be the only dvd release of this movie."
4,good,i was please with the package. and the movie was in good shape. so i was please with this order.
4,great movie,Such a beautiful love story with highs and lows. I received my product in a timely manner and packaging was good.
5,Jason's Lyric,I feel this movie shows how real love can come from the unexpected. And how life can bring circumstances that you cannot handle no matter how hard you try.
3,"Simple Story, but in excellence of mannerism","Jason's Lyric, a story about an astute poet who exaggurates about leaving the 'Ghetto Hood' of Los Angeles, CA finds it worth while when meeting a troubled individual with a shocking past. The two fall in love but first must overcome obstacles in their own lives. Jada Pinkett and Allen Payne provide decent preformance and make the movie worthy of watching and understanding the story. Unlike the stupidity of the storytellers basing a movie in the deprived areas of America, this movie shows the obvious human side to the characters and gets you attached to them even more.Although the ending of the movie was an enigma in itself, the story was adequate in most areas and tied the lives of the characters together to bring one of the passable plots of the 90s."
3,not a bad movie at all,"I would like to find out if this movie has been cancelled on DVD or what. i heard that it was suppose to be out on 1/26/99 Polygram, but I can't find it on DVD anywhere. Does anyone know whats up? Email me your answer......"
3,Body double,"I really liked this movie great story and I really liked the love scene until i was told Jada had a body double in the love scene then it seemed fake,but other than that i enjoyed the film"
1,sucks sucks sucks!!!! 0/5 stars,"I got this gun for a bargin of 2.00 at a flea market (new) and when i got home ......heres the list of reviews:*bad accuracy*lazer flickers if you tighten the holder*no safety (kids,you WILL shoot your eye out!)*fps is below 100 (you can see the bullet fly)*gun is small*cheap plastic* the mag holds about 10 rounds*and lastly it has no meaning of hurt to it!"
4,Found: His Perfect Wife by Marie Farrarella (Large Print Silhouette Special Edition),"Third book set in Hades, Alaska, part of 'The Alaskans' series.Description from the book back cover:Unexpected marriage ... It was love at first sight for Alison Quintano when handsome stranger Luc LeBlanc saved her from a mugger. Ironically, Luc got hurt in the encounter and so, when he needed a favour, Alison was prepared to help him out, even though he wanted a temporary wife! So Alison bravely agreed to accompany Luc to his Alaskan home as 'Mrs. LeBlanc'. But soon this marriage masquerade was stirring up real emotions, and Alison was uncovering the woman she'd always tried to deny. Could she convince Luc that he had found true love at last?"
3,it's ok.,I just need one song from the cd. some songs are not that good what i expected. but it is okay.
4,Better Than The Other,"Sick yes, Loud yes, Original, a little bit. But a hell of a lot better then their other album. This rocks."
5,A Seminal Work of Plainly Indispensible Value,"A highly detailed account of the origin of the Anglo-Saxons, Germans, Jutes and Danes with four maps showing the ancient homelands in Scandinavia, Germany and Britain early in the present era.It has often been said that the English nation had sprung from diverse racial origns, but while it indeed represents an amalgam of Anglo-Saxons, Germans, Jutes and Danes, with related Celtic elements, these peoples were all closely related. Even the Celts are now believed to have separated from the Germanic speakers only a thousand years or so B.C., when they spread out in all directions from the common Germanic-Celtic homeland north of the European Alps.Contents include: The Saxons, Angles and Jutes in Britain; The Angles and Saxons in Germany; The Danish Settlers; The Classification of the Ancient Germanii."
4,I love Amazon! Best shopping ever!,"I bought the Thing costume for my son, it was dirt cheap and a great product. I absolutely love Amazon, one can save so much money."
4,BIG MASK,"Bought this costume for my son who is 4 1/2 yrs old. He is about 39 inches tall, 39 lbs (average size, little on the skinny side). The body costume looks cool and fits him great. The mask is way too big though, he can barely see through the mask because the eye holes are too far apart and the chin hangs really low so he can't look down. Mask would be perfect for 10-12 yr old. I actually put on the mask and it fit perfect (my head is same size as 12 yr old). But my son loves the costume."
1,Zen confusions,"The author is currently mixin up two different tribes of Papua (Irian Jaya), one time he even quote a story from Borneo. He describes the Dani people as Cannibals and Headhunters, they never have been both. Its the story of a unprepared man who climbes the highest peak of Papua.He did it, but I would not have been a member of the tourist-group he went with.The whole book is a shame, and the only remote thing in it, is the mind of the author."
1,Ineptitude at its highest level,"I found myself wondering how the author had the nerve to write such an embarrassing book about his own ineptitude and poor planning. Perhaps Zen offers some explanation for him but I sure can't. Like another reviewer, I was glad I wasn't a part of the group with which he was traveling. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Finishing this book was a test of my will,I whole-heartedly agree with what the above to folks had to say. The author was absolutlely hopeless and self-absorbed.
1,Probably the WORST travelogue ever written,"I never finished this book.The style is childish, usage of English poor, what little background information is presented was obviously all gathered from the same one travel guide.So much of that ""information"" is wrong and even derogatory that the Dani people could sue the author for defaming!Can you believe that Kipling's Jungle Book is cited in the ""bibliography""???It is true!!! :-))))No more comment is needed, I believe."
4,Beginning to intermediate level,"Ever wonder about the outputs that have the term plan in the PMBOK are ? i.e. Project Plan, Communication management plan or Risk management plan. This book gives template which are filled by the books example project a ""water amusement park"" with guidance on how to write them. And other templates such Request For Proposal and Status meetings. It will definitely shed light on what these articles are to the newcomer to the PMBOK or project management. However I was not overly impressed with the contents, perhaps the authors were trying to keep it generic and not too complicated for the reader. The CD ROM is an exact duplicate of the book in MS-Word format. So don't expect any more on the CD, a disappointment to me. The book seemed to be missing on templates for budgets, time keeping, work completed and more. Not for a seasoned project manager."
3,Not available on cloud reader - why not?????,Looks good - but can't read it on a PC in the cloud reader - disappointed!!!!There are a lot of good project plans and other documentation - I was looking forward to reading it on a PC.
4,GET OVER IT ALREADY!!!,"Can anyone out there understand that this music is meant for CHILDREN to listen to? It's not produced for the musical talent. The kids singing these songs will not win any awards for their versions of the originals. It was produced for CHILDREN. Now use a little common sence here...the girl mentioned in ""Sk8er Boi"" is OLDER than the songs intended target audience. Get a clue and get over it!!! The music is cute and will give kids an alternative to the originals, plus these kids versions are edited...what parent really wants their children listening to the unedited versions in the first place, right? Take the songs for what their worth... my kids (ages 8,6 &4) enjoy ALL the Kidz Bop CDs and I don't find anything in them that would ever keep me from prohibiting my children from listening to them."
3,"Fun, but silly","Hi,(...) and I still like these CDs because I think they are fun, but silly. I just got the Kidz bop 4 CD and I like it when they sing Evanescence's ""Bring me to life,"" No doubt's ""Underneath it all,"" and Good Charlotte's ""The anthem."" I think the kids are probably all between 6 or 7 and possibly go up to middle school age (12 or a little older.) Some of these kids are good singers, while others are fun to laugh at since they are so bad."
2,Eh.,"I think it's really horrible to make kids listen to this jargon. ""WOO! It's got kids on it! They'll listen!"" It's like bad karaoke. The only reason I gave it any stars at all, is because they have kid's best interests at heart, and you've gotta love that."
5,listen to me,These c.d.'s are for kids. You are not liking these c.d.'s because you are not kids. Children all over the world buy these c.d.'s.*****************PEACE EVERYWERE**************
1,Scary. Just REAL Scary.,"Talk about scary. It's one thing to re-record radio hits with small children... it's another thing to make poor decisions. Evanescence's ""Bring Me To Life"", clearly one of the frontrunners for biggest hit of 2003, doesn't quite belong on this CD. ""Save me from the nothing I've become""... mmm... yes, this is what I want my 4 year old to be singing along to with a big grin on his face. I think not. That is seriously borderline morbid, and while it could serve as some kind of piece of abstract modern art, it's not a very good idea to bring it to the masses and into the minivan.As far as the remainder of the CD... sure, it seems like a great idea. Let songwriters get the maximum bang for their buck, ween older kids out of Raffi and into pop... but I think it should have been clear to the creators when they listened to the results of Kidz Bop 1 that this was just not a product with either a long shelf life or credibility."
1,they ruined some great songs!!,"hi. For all you people LOVING this..i don't encourage it. Let me make a point thought,~THE SONGS ARE APPROPRIATE!!~ they completely ruined bring me to life..in the chorus please listen to the man..not to mention it sounds constipated when it holds a note out too long. horiblay!"
1,PLZ JUST DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH ON THIS,Parents plz plz DO NOT BUT THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF (place word here)Have any of u ever even herd the lyrics? KIDS try to learn the lyrics and they're good at memorizing songs. Do you really want to be sitting at your dinner table and hear songs about drugs and sex come out of your childrens mouths?!?!? I sure as heck dont!! I meen they're not even good at singing! Its like trying to listen to Abanchie or however you spell that things name!!! COME ON PEOPLE I know tv has all these vidieos on it anyway but do u really want to encourage it?PLZ DONT BUY THIS CD FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR CHILDREN'S MINDS!!!
4,Ketchup Song is the reason to buy this CD,"Well, I have ""skimmed"" through this CD, and it's pretty good. I would like a different variety of songs (Miss Independent has already been played to death! and Sk8er Boi - yuck!) but I work with kids, and have to play ""kid friendly"" tapes. The radio is not allowed. Since this CD has KIDS in the title, it's ok - even though it's radio songs - but it's managments call so go figure.Anyway, the main reason I bought this CD was for the Ketchup Song. It is catchy, fun and will make inside time a lot more fun and bearable. One can only listen to ""This Old Man"" or ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" a certain amount of times before going crazy, and Kids Bop CD's are great!"
2,KIDZ BOP SUCKS,THE KIDS WHO SING THESE SONGS PROBABLY GET BEAT UP AT SCHOOL AND MADE FUN OF. I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE ALL OF THE KIDZ BOP SINGERS ONE BY ONE AND . THEN THERE WOULD BE NO MORE CRAP.
1,Yuck...,"If you want to hear kids sing, ask your friend to sing to you. It's a lot cheaper, and chances are, your friend will sound a lot better then the group of kids that sing this boring, annoying series of CDs! If I were a singer, I would never let Kidz Bop butcher my songs! Actually, in my opinion, the songs aren't the same as the originals much at all. The music is screwy, the person they have sing lead is a terrible vocalist, and the kids sound just as bad. I would recommend the Radio Disney CDs. Not only are they clean, but they don't have a bunch of kids ruin hit songs. Ugh! When will the Kidz Bop series end? Hopefully soon."
1,RUN AWAY,This cd is like the worst cd i ever heard. I don't think Sk8er Boi and Jenny from the Block are meant for little kids. They even messed up my favorite song which is Bring Me To Life. I would never buy this for anyone.
1,Why do People Call this Music??,"I think that it was a horrible idea for young kids to resing all of these hit songs. Their versions of it sound horrible.But also, I don't think it's that appropriate for young kids to be singing these songs. A lot of them probably don't really understand the lyrics; they just like the rhythm.Unless you love to listen to little kids screeching about some skater boy, PLEASE don't buy this CD."
1,Kidz Bop SUCKS major !#@%,"i've always hated kidz bop.they're all so freakin annoying. its a knock off of the NOW series and is the worst idea i've ever heard of. it ticks me off that these little midgits are singing songs favored in my age group and makeing sell outs of the good songs. you cant go lower than Kidz Bop . there were some one time good songs that i dont listen to any more because my 5 year old brother is singing them. and some songs are innappropriate for a bunch of whinny kids. it annoys the hell out of me. our music is ours, let the little ones listen to NSYNC and backstreet boys."
4,An Enjoyable Visit--,"While this is not the most comprehensive video on the Queen, it is a most pleasant documentary, not only about Her Majesty but about many of the traditions surrounding the monarchy. I agree with another reviewer that the coronation footage is amazing in its restoration.An inexpensive addition, most welcome, to my DVD library."
1,Open your mind to all therapies and think....,"I read this to help with pain. As we all know, for ""pain go to a chiropracter for help"". Well, this got me interested in the scientific evidence to support chiropractic care. The support is not there - basically a faith based treatment for pain, which will work 30% of the time, as good as a sugar pill. There is no scientific evidence to support this book. Nothing helped my pain, so I'll look elsewhere. Sorry I couldn't be positive."
3,"good, but not well written","This book is more quantitative than the author's other book, but it is still very basic. The author is also a little redundant in his writing. He spends a lot of time talking about the different types of funds available, but not actually giving that much insight into how they are run.This is a good book for someone like myself that has very little prior knowledge about hedge funds, although it could have been written better. There are many misprints, yet the organization is good.The most rewarding parts of the book are the questions at the end of each chapter. The answers are provided at the end of the book and many of the Q & A's give you more insight into hedge funds than the actual body. This is a good book for someone with no knowledge of hedge funds but would be too simplistic for someone that has already has knowledge of them."
2,couldn't get past the blunders on the 2nd formula,"OK, so I am a quant and I thought a simple guide could show me ""the ropes"". But when a ""Course"" gets the definition of standard deviation WRONG on page 12 (it's missing the square root, and doesn't define rbar as the average return), I must simply give up. Wiley? Hello?! Anybody proofreading these??"
4,Slightly scattered but HIGHLY entertaining noir novel.,"Mike Robinson's novel is an enjoyable ride through the seedy underworld of rodents, insects, and the other sorts of vermin.Unlike most novels featuring anthropomorphic rodents, which feature cute, happy mice who overcome their small size to win the day, the protagonist of Vermin Street is a rat. And not an overly pleasant one, either - a refreshing change from the norm.Though the book can get overly wordy, there are a handful of printing errors, and the narrative feels slightly scattered at times, there is a quality about the darkness that I find very appealing. Also, the verbosity of its author is tempered by his willingness to try and dazzle the reader with his descriptions. Robinson never seems to lack for new ways to describe even mundane items and situations, and many of his phrasings border, and periodically do cross into, the brilliant.A worthy effort, and I look forward to more from this author."
4,a slice of (Hollywood) life in 2011,"Russ Meyer meets Woody Allen meets Cheech & Chong meets Karate Kid... Playboy mansion babes planning world domination while lounging at the poolside listening to elektro new wave music (cool Arling & Cameron soundtrack)... 3 hipster slackers getting pick-up lessons from the Cassanova neighbour... It's funny and witty and intelligent but also trashy and, at times, misogynic. In a word: a slice of (Hollywood) life in 2011."
1,thanks for nothing.,"For a start the title is misleading as there are no Hollywood, no sex and no wars. Most chicks plainly plain with acting abilities well below zero. What this flick reflect perfectly is general confusion about life in US--nobody work but has money, how everybody pays bills is mystery, prostitution is illegal and has negative image so chicks are trying to do their best to look...ehehe hard to say from the movie. What everybody does is drugs, drinking and havinng good time and in addition chicks trying to extort money from guys. Family values left in 19th century etc. You get the idea. Yes, couple times we see tits. Should I continue?"
5,The Temptress Review,This book is great reading I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to read books in their spare time.
4,The real Nashville,"If you look beneath the hype, the branding and the 24/7 publicity machine of today's Nashville music business, you'll see a different Nashville. The other Nashville is populated by singers and musicians who tend to be guided more by their muse than their publicist (if they had one). The music on this album shows this other Nashville. Not fashioned to be fashionable, each artist is unique to his or her musical voice and art.You may not like every song or singer, but you will hear the Nashville grounded in the basic sounds and history that seem to be missing from the country music of today's radio and television.It's music from the other side of the alley and the other side of the river (Cumberland, that is). It's music to be heard and appreciated."
4,Tax Revolt by Social Delinquents,"Exciting action, vivid characters, and evil politics kept the pages turning for me.However, the two major themes of general criminal mischief and a major tax revolt are not well balanced or integrated. Perhaps this should have been two books.I still liked it"
4,Another Rosamunde Pilcher !!,I found this book at a used book store in England recently. I am a fan of Rosamunde Pilcher( The Shellseekers) I was told that if I liked her then I would enjoy Marcia Willett. They were right! This is an excellent book. In the very best tradition of Pilcher theis story involves great characters and wonderful descriptions of the landscape and great interactions with dogs!! The story centers on a woman who left her husband and daughter for another man and he leaves her. She deeply regrets her affair and seeks to return to her family who can't forgive her. In the course of this she moves to a seaside cottage rentfree so that she can take care of an elderly lady who lives in the house.The rest of this great story involves several other characters and the relationships that develop when the lady dies leaving her estate to unknown relatives. Please get more of these books she has written several other books!
5,I LOVE THIS THING!!,"I bought the bounce got my son's 2nd birthday party instead of renting one for $275 for 4 hours, I was skeptical at first and so was hubby but I love it love it love it, My sons love it I have a 2yr old and an 8 month old , For his party up to 5 kids fit in it with no problem 3 yrs and under, It was a hit for his party and we have used it about 4 times total, It inflates in 5 seconds and takes a while to disinflate, Its easy to put away and fold but it never fit in the box it came in so buy a bag for it. Anyway it must remain on constantly while in use. I love it , It's totally worth it. Make sure you put a large cloth or plastic cover under it to protect it from rocks and stuff. Have fun jumping i know we do!! Oh yeah even I have gone in there to play with my 2 kids :)"
5,years of fun for kids,I have three children from 2-8 years of age and they all LOVE it!!! It is very durable. Even my 200 pound husband did not have a problem in it. I highly recommend this toy. It inflates and defaltes in less than a minute.
3,Adequate but not Great,"After a three year absence from Notes, I needed to get up to speed fast on the new revs. At the time I purchased this book, I also purchased Mastering Lotus Notes R5 by Haberman & Falciani. From an intermediate level users standpoint, I found the Sams book adequate but nearly every question that I needed answered in some depth I found in Mastering. In a nutshell, I could have saved the money for the Sams book since Mastering provided everthing and much more. This was especially true in setting up Internet accounts and Locations as well as understanding how to manage databases."
4,I'll never watch TV news the same way again.,"Right from the start, I knew Reno McCarthy was going to get into trouble. Most people know better than to return to an old job. Sure enough, while doing some investigative work for his old boss, McCarthy busts in on a murder and things go downhill from there. Cummings gives us an inside look at broadcast media, exposing some of its foibles while letting us share McCarthy's frustrations with himself and his situation.""Deader"" is fast and fun, a great adventure in a great city with great characters. I look forward to seeing more of them in future books."
5,Pulse Quickening Mystery!,"Cummings' skillfully written descriptions were so realistic that I felt like I was right there along Reno's side. For example, when Reno was punched I felt the whack. The book drew me in deeper, the more I read. I had a hard time putting it down. Without being predictable, Cummings left me craving more info to solve the mystery. Totally action packed, from the very first chapter. With the turn of each page, I was excited to discover the next dilemma Reno would need to work his way out of. This book is filled with surprises!"
5,A Debut CD With A Voice Direct From Heaven!,Listening to this CD is Sheer Delight!A voice so pure and beautiful it will bring tears to your eyes and you will be convinced you are hearing an angel sing!David's tenor voice intimately caresses you like a gentle lover...and at the same time the power of those vocal cords will give you goosebumps and leave you breathless!This CD is a MUST HAVE for every collection!Don't hesitate...join the many who have already discovered the pleasure this amazing talent can bring to you!
3,Great Pen...better in the .5mm though,"Somehow came into possession of one of these pens and fell in love with it. After a few months of constant use, it finally quit on me and I wanted to get a package of multiple. Unfortunately, nowhere on the pen itself does it indicate what millimeter tip it is equipped with. I took a guess on the .7mm but guessed wrong :( No fault of the seller, just wasn't sure. Pen is still pretty decent, but not what I fell in love with originally. I will definitely be buying another pack of these...just will make sure they are .5mm when I do."
4,"Great feel for a large pen, but water soluble","The pen writes easily, smudges a bit but is fairly quick drying. Left-handers might think twice. It is a very large pen, with a good, rubberized grip.Largest issue is that the ink appears to be water soluble, and can smear/run heavily if it comes into contact with liquid -- from rain to a busted water heater. It is not the best archival writer for this reason."
3,"Writes nice, but potentially messy","These pens are pleasurable to write with and produce a satisfying, bold line very reliably. However, there are a couple of problems. First, the ink dries a little slowly and is therefore slightly prone to smearing -- not a big deal, but worth noting. More significantly, I've had several of these pens leak on me. The conical area just tipward of the grip gets covered in ink; I've had to throw away 3 or 4 out of a box of 12 for this reason so far."
5,Bic Grip Roller Pens,"I love these pens, they are hard to find locally.Amazon.com to the rescue. Easy ordering, excellent updates on package delivery and fast shipping."
1,Dried out while sitting in Amazon's warehouse,"I've used these pens before, so I know they work just fine and the ink should glide right out of the tip. But out of the entire box of pens I got from Amazon, most were dried and faulty. I had to send them back. Disappointed, b/c I do a lot of Amazon shopping and usually most of their stuff is great. I wouldn't waste your time buying these pens here, though."
4,Bic Roller to the Rescue@ my House!,Works for me and tired of ball point pens that won't work after a few years or even new ones made in China!I still like to write a note and hold a pen and see the ink flow in TexasRon in Texas 1-22-2013
2,Better than no Buffett... barely,"They try hard. Really hard. Kinda the antithesis of the Parrothead Approach. Even so, they come up shorter than a dwarf in a slam-dunk contest.The dustsleeve/card on the album claims that Parrotheads all over will love the spicy new mix. pumpkin spice and marjory are spices, and that is about all these guys brought to the party (their salt shaker is empty to boot...)"
5,Heartwarming Story,"This is a heartwarming story, very well written, about a man who builds a home on the side of a giant redwood tree. A family of skunks claim the house as their own, and the man is kind to them. Other forest animals visit, as well. The man doesn't have the heart to turn the animals away, nor can he turn away children from two fueding families. My eight year old son loved this book at bedtime. It's a gentle story written decades ago, in a gentler time. Highly recommended."
5,PWIM User,"The Picture Word Inductive Model (PWIM), developed by Emily Calhoun, is being used extensively in an elementary where I work as curriculum coordinator. The teachers and students report that it's fun, engaging, and well worth the time and energy devoted to it. The expert users find that this model reveals very helpful knowledge about student learning and are able to make targeted instructional decisions as a result. Using students' own language, PWIM builds sight word acquisition, hones categorization skills, develops knowledge and use of phonics, and increases word, sentence, and paragraph comprehension, among others things. I highly recommend this useful book."
2,"Not a Bad Egg, Not a Good Egg","Shipping took forever, almost a month to get here after much trouble.Bought this to to relieve stress but ironically, it did the opposite.Egg is smaller than I thought for my hand. It does maintain its egg shape, which is a plus.It also collects dust very easily and there is a ""rotten"" smell to the egg that you can also smell on your hand after squeezing it."
3,"Nice. Not thrilling, but nice.","I ordered the ""firm"" resistance variety, thinking that at worst I could work my way into it if it were too tough for me at in the beginning. Unfortunately, I found that it was far too easy and didn't give my hands/fingers much of a workout at all. My kids enjoy playing with it, however and it was relatively inexpensive, so it wasn't a total waste."
4,Good product,"Product comes as advertised and shipped quickly. I ended up getting three different strengths as it is hard to judge what will suit you best without actually trying them in person. I would recommend the very soft and then soft first.4 stars because the one I bought from Brookstone many years ago had a slightly better tactile feel and better grip, but these are fine too."
5,Wonderful Hand Exerciser,I love to use this exerciser as I walk around the park. Fits perfectly in my hand!
4,There good,I bought two of them thinking that i would be able to use them anywhere. I have not really used them as much as i like but they are nice. There shape helps fit into the palm of my hand so its more comfortable. I have the medium one and i think that works just fine for me. I found you have to squeeze it a while to make it softer. But it works great.
2,gets gummy,"I like the texture of these Eggercizers, but after manipulating them for a while they get gummy. Baby powder or cornstarch helped, but that gets tacky, too, after a short time."
5,Does its purpose,"This is a simple device used to create strength in the hand and very easy to use. My daughter got it when rehabing a softball injury. Great, simple product."
3,School book...,"I read this for my History, Technology and Science class in college. It is quite intriguing a life that Palchinsky leads. The book starts off telling about his life in general and how it ended, and his influences on Russia. But then halfway through the book, the focus shifts to descriptions of technological failures the Soviet Union encountered and how they struggled to beat other countries in the engineering field.I don't think this book really gives Palchinsky the credit he desrves and this book certainly isn't all about him, just brief historical facts."
4,Test your knowledge,This book consist primarily of multiple-choice questions about economics. I have used it during my undergraduate studies and it helped me significantly. Although it is not sufficiently challenging for postgraduate study of economics - I can recommend it to anyone who is still undergraduate.
4,It will change the way you look at ads,"A thoughful and revealing book that takes a look at the myriad of commercial images we see everyday, and challenges us to stop and say, ""Wait a minute, what does that imply? What am I being told?"" Kilbourne's passion for this topic is evident, and some might say that some of her ideas are a little extreme. But as a rocovering alcoholic and smoker, she has valid perspective, and her overall position is balanced. The final chapter where she outlines the changes that can be made in society to remedy the problem of advertizing is a refreshing change from other books of this genre that ideantify the problem, but seldom give any solutions."
1,Metal you can bend with your fingertips,"This was a disaster of a shelving unit. I got it, unpacked it and raised my eyebrow at the seemingly flimsy construction materials, but thought ""Hey, maybe when it's together, it's stable."" It isn't.To give you an idea of how flimsy this ""metal"" unit is, my two year old picked up one of the ""stability"" bars, and was able to bend it in half. The materials are about as strong as tinfoil. Seriously, you get what you pay for with this unit."
1,Shelves of Frustration,"The worst shelving unit I've ever had the displeasure to assemble. Connectors do not fit in shelves, each piece had to be modified, connectors are flimsy and bend much too easily. Beware, apparently this company has absolutely no quality control."
1,Trash,"Just bought this an hour ago at target, and I'm not even sure how it holds up it's own weight in the picture. The other reviews say it all, and I wish I had read them before assembling this tin foil disaster. Even managed to cut my hand handling the razor thin metal while I was trying to disassemble it."
3,face mask for air soft gun,I asked my son what he thought. He is 13. He said the mask is very comfortable on the face and has good coverage for protection. The problem is when trying to shoot the gun it is difficult to align the site on the gun because vision is blocked somewhat. You have to turn your head on a weird angle to get a good shot.
5,A RARE GEM; BEAUTIFULLY POLISHED,"If you want a true picture of Opera Buffa, look no further. ""Matrimonio"" is an absolute joy; a sympathetic cast, uncluttered scenery and good conducting. It is the type of plot that is just what one would expect from an opera such as this. One would be pretty stiff not to fall in love with its inherent humor and delightful singing. In short buy it and find great pleasure in the whole preformance."
3,"Smallish pans, after 2 years show the wear...","Can't complain for price paid (one oh nine, shipped). These are well made and high quality. The only drawback as mentioned by another reviewer are the fact that these pans are on the small size- I guess I'll wait for another sale from A-zon for larger pieces. Heat up quickly and evenly on my new glass-top range, easy cleanup.Dropped 2 stars, should be 2 1/2 (originally at 5)- these things aren't holding up as well as they should. My girlfriend runs these through the dishwasher too much, but they are now showing signs of fading, scratches, etc."
4,Good value for a good cookware set,"I replaced an old set of cookware with this set recently. They are very functional -- heat fast and evenly and cleanup is a breeze. Very satisfied with this purchase, and have purchased several separate items to complete my cookware needs. Recommended."
3,Can't use cooking spray or high heat?,"We don't buy sets of cookware lightly in my house, and this was the first significant amount of money I've paid for a set. We really loved the pans at first, but they have gradually lost their non-stick qualities - mainly the two saute pans. I knew there was a lifetime warranty, so I just looked it up. Their warranty page indicates that 1) using cooking spray or 2) using high heat voids the warranty! Unreal! We've had the set for about 5 years."
2,Not dishwasher safe!!!,"I've owned this set for 3-4 months at the time of this review. I have been extremely pleased with the performance of this set, however a week ago I noticed that one of my pans had been damaged due to dishwasher use. I had used one of the detergent gels that the manufacturer recommends. I checked with Anolon to find that the ""lifetime warranty"" on these dishwasher safe pots does not include damage that occured in the dishwasher. If you like these pots for their other features they are a great purchase but do not expect to be able to toss them in the dishwasher without consequence. I am very disappointed and we'll eventually be replacing these with stainless steel pots."
4,Great quality and Machine washable,"Hi,I just bought this 2 weeks backs, it arrived on time, well packed and with warranty info.The set is very heavy, and looks great...but the best part is it is dishwater safe which is very important to me."
3,Handles too heavy for Pot,The handles on the small pot and frying pan seem too be heavy and they want to fall over. This is first time I have ever experienced this with any pots or frying pans. Really wierd!
5,GREAT COOKWARE,"THIS SET IS THE BEST COOKWARE I'VE EVER OWNED AND THE PRICE WAS GREAT, THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SUCH GREAT PRODUCTS AND GREAT PRICES."
4,Great cookware,I love this set. It heats evenly and can go from stovetop to oven. I wish the saucepans were a little larger but I would purchase it again nevertheless.
3,tough,"If you're not a yid...especially with some orthodox background, it's going to be a tough read."
1,I dropped after 20 pages,"I though that I was familiar with the Yiddish vocabulary, but I could not understand any slang. I also couldn't care less. I didn't relate at all with the story and any of the characters. Actually I found everything very annoying. When I drop a book, it is because there is absolutely no way to proceed. I am very benevolent with books, but this one didn't have a chance. Congratulations to those that read it and enjoyed. I'll wait for the Cohen brothers movie."
3,Good reading.,"This book starts slow but it gets better as you go. I have not finished it yet, but now I am really looking forward to see how it ends. To me, a book is good when it can hold your interest in spite of not being super exciting or with a lot of action. This one is worth reading."
2,Too much going on,"To me, this was like Chabon trying to be Dan Brown (and I am a fan of Chabon, but not Dan brown). Too many characters, the plot line is too complex and fantastic. I like fantasy, I like revisionist history, but at some point the story for me became discombobulated and way to far reaching. I liked the general story of the death of Mendel Shpilman, but the side plots were too numerous and far fetched. Readable yes. Admirable, no."
2,Boring and vacuous,"I thought at the end there would be some great insightful, philosophical meaning to this book. I kept reading it even though it took five weeks because I don't speak Yiddish and there was no plot to follow. At the end, and this is a spoiler, all that happens is nothing. It was probably the worst book I have ever stubbornly stuck through. I really like this author, and you can tell he expended a ton of energy and time researching and writing this long novel, but in the end it was all wasted. It just isn't that good and is completely uninteresting. I wait anxiously for his next book."
5,Wonderful!,"I waded through the first half of the book looking at a dictionary to familiarize myself with the yiddish on every page. It was definitely an education and as I became more comfortable, I let the story unfold and the scenes becoming more and more vivid. Now I'd love to know more about Alaska history, the Jews there and more. Thanks for the ride!"
4,insight,"Insight into a slightly fantastic jewish world, which can explain to an unreligious European some of the weird phenomena,that religion introduces into our life. Well, although nott brilliantly not written,and a good story."
2,Another showoff,"Drunk on his own words, piling his strained metaphors on, Chabon is a ""Look at me! Look at me!"" writer if this book is any indication. Tiresome."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"Gave 2 stars in fairness because I couldn't get way through, though I went much further with this than usual due to the author's reputation and early hype.Needs a Yiddish glossary. I understood about 2/3's but people from Utah will be stumped most of the time."
2,Tedious,"A long tedious book, offensive in the use of Yid on every page. convuluted.A dozen names that are hard to remember, and its called a mystery. Ridiculous."
1,Yeeesh,"I like alternate history, Alaska, and a decent mystery novel.This was awful. The first Chabon book I read was, of course, ""Kavalier and Clay."" It was great, so I read ""Mysteries of Pittsburgh,"" which was disappointing. This was just awful. I didn't understand what was going on most of the time, I couldn't figure out what the Yiddish meant, the writing was choppy, and the plot didn't seem to be able to make up its mind about which way it wanted to go.I only finished it because I had nothing else to do when I was at work. If I had thought to bring some logic problems with me, I would have given up on this mess about 100 pages in."
1,Helps to be Jewish - but not enough.,"Chabon's talent shines through even as he disappoints.First off, the deluge of Yiddish and invented near-Yiddish words makes the book tough slogging. If you don't come from this background, you start off with a handicap. (Count the number of Jewish last names among the five star reviewers, and compare to the one star reviewers.) Then, the plot takes half the book to start moving faster than a crawl.On the good side, Chabon's virtuoso use of the language is as good as Nabokov with an extra side order of sarcasm. His laugh-out-loud wisecracks are almost worth slogging through this book. But not quite. For this one - two thumbs down and an ""Oy, veh!"""
1,Overhyped,"This book is completely overhyped and disappointing. Author tries to be too cute with Jewish language, and the story is a bore. I put it down without even finishing it."
1,Beautifuly written awful story,"Chabon writes beautifully. Unfortunately, this book is about as interesting as reading a gorgeously penned description of wallpaper drying.I was the ONLY one in my book group who even bothered to finish it. However, we all agreed it was awful."
1,Ulp !!!,"The nicest thing i can say about this one is that Chabom has done better!This is not a review in the strict sense, but my badly addled mind reacting to a horrible book. I cannot dignify this to be either a novel nor comedy, well written or not.I accept the basic premise (Israel overrun in 1948 - ""alternate history"") - which becomes the story line. However, the book is a combination of some the worst stereotypes (and stereotypes of stereotypes) and ugliness pretending to be comedy I've seen in years. I was sick to my stomach. I cannot believe that Chabon is such a self hater... And I will stop there......"
1,The ultimate downer,"Because of the title and the unlikely setting, I assumed this would be a somewhat humorous book. Not so! If you appreciate dour, hopeless, helpless subject matter, and excessive descriptive ability regarding illness and physical limitations, this is your book. The characters, all Jewish, call each other ""Yid."" I found the entire book offensive, and I am not Jewish. I am not looking to any other offering by this author"
1,"If I was Jewish, I Might Enjoy!",I really tried to finish this book. Didn't make it. Author wrote this for Jewish people.
1,"Oy, How Pretentious","A man is found murdered in a fleabag hotel in Sitka, where Jews found a temporary homeland for at least 60 years after the Holocaust. Turns out the man might have been the messiah, and gave justification for the planned destruction of Dome of the Rock. The murder investigation shows that even without a messiah, the plan continues.The story is tedious, characters dull, and plot convoluted. Don't waste your time."
2,Book by it's cover,"Chris Ware should get royalties for this book cover, sincerest form of flattery, but please."
5,Another Classic From Chabon,"If you loved Summerland, Wonder Boys, Mysteries of Pittsburgh order The Yiddish Policemen's Union today. Chabon delivers another classic."
4,Chabon is smart....and he knows it.,"I do love Chabon. His work is certainly in the tops when we talk about clever, lyrical, metaphorical and even laughable. He certainly has lines that make me laugh out loud which is quite rare. The characters are quite engaging and relate-able the story is, well, exciting, smart, witty, fun and unexpected. Altered history is always fun to postulate and ponder. The situations he greats are both outlandish and realistic. My only complaint about Michael Chabon is that he is so witty, wordy and clever and he knows it. He flaunts it, sometimes to the point where it hurts what he is actually trying to say. He may be a walking thesaurus but filling a page or three with a single description isn't very productive, and in fact, comes off as rather arrogant. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoy his writing, characters and stories and look forward to his continual work. It's a great addition to his, already, impressive accomplishments."
3,Enjoyable,"Not as good as some of Chabon's other books, but enjoyable. The ending felt a little rushed. All of a sudden there were characters and conspiracies necessary to wrap up the plot. Maybe I missed their introductions or hints of their introductions earlier, but the end was a little convenient."
2,Oy Gevalt,"How could you take such an exciting idea and make it into such a tedious, boring, overinflated novel. I'm sorry, this writer is talented and smart, but he's no John Grisham, who as a writer is not as talented and smart, but he sure knows how to tell a story. This guy hasn't a clue, and I don't think he has any respect for readers to tolerate all the nonsensical, convolutions, the Jewish shtick is OK, but way overdone, of plot. I said to myself, is this ever going to be interesting, or worth reading--no less all the time and effort it took to write it--the answer was a resounding NO.I think any sane editor would have told him, very early on, Michael this is terrible, you have a gem of an idea and talent but, when is this novel going to wake up from its frozen pickled herring slumber.YAWN. YAWN. YAWN.If it wasn't for the professional critic's hype this thing would land on the remainder table in a flash. Definitely not worth your time.The best thing about it is the cover."
3,What is the point,"Considering the high praise this book received from the critics, obviously I missed something. My interest in this book went from being fascinated by the setting and the mystery to disappointment in an ending that made little sense. It helps, I presume, to have a basic understanding of the Jewish culture and of Yiddish. I found the book hard going at times but pushed on expecting to be rewarded by an exciting ending. It didn't happen. The book did revive my interest in Chess, a game I want to renew my interest and skills in. I even ordered a book on the subject from Amazon."
1,Yawn,"I feel bad leaving a negative review because everyone seems to love this novel and Chabon seems like a nice fellow, not to mention that his previous work was fantastic, but the writing in this book is terrible. My boyfriend and I read it at the same time, and we would read passages out loud and wonder 'what does that mean?' It was as if we couldn't really get at the meat of the matter, the details, what was going on. Ultimately, I stuck with it until 50 pages shy of the end, then just had to stop. I got sidetracked with a Jonathan Lethem novel. I'm hoping my boyfriend will finish and just tell me how it ends. It's too bad because the plot is fantastic, but the writing just fails."
1,I gave it away,"I forced myself to finish the book. It was awful. I'm amazed that it received an award. I drove to the library and handed it to the librarian as a donation. Her face lit up and she was clearly happy to get this just released, like new book. I was happy to never see it on my bookshelf."
1,Disappointed,"I heard so many good things about Chabon that I decided to read his new book. I am struggling. It is hard to understand--too many Yiddish phrases that I don't comprehend. I have lots of Jewish friends, so you would think that something would be familiar. Oh well, I will try to finish this book as I hate to give up on anything, but it will be hard. Don't think I will try Chabon's other books."
1,Chabon at His Dullest...and Most Disappointing,"I usually adore Michael Chabon's work, whether it be a quick read like ""Mysteries of Pittsburg"" or a hearty, slow-burn page-turner like ""The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"". Like other reviewers who gave this book a poor rating, I simply couldn't get past the first few hundred pages of ""Yiddish Policemen's"". Initially, I felt dense, perhaps as if I was missing something crucial Chabon was trying to get across to me the reader. However, what really WAS missing were two of Chabon's strengths: engaging language and characters the readers actually care about, even if they have a hard time liking them. If you ask the question ""I wonder what happens to this guy at the end of the book?"" and the answer is ""Who cares?"", it's time to put the book down, and move on to the next tome."
1,Our entire book club couldn't get through this book!,"My book club is made up of well-educated and well-read people. A few read and loved Chabon's previous work. NONE of us could make it through this book. It seemed overly wordy, complex, and indirect. One third through this book we still couldn't figure out what it was about and why we should care about the characters. And, if you don't know Yiddish words, you're hopelessly lost. We can't figure it out: why does everyone else rave about this byzantine and plot-less book? Maybe if we stuck it out past the first half, it would have redeemed itself?"
1,Disappointing,Way below my expectations after Kavalier. Characters are unsympathetic ; story premise is weak; writing is plodding. I am half way through and I lost interest continuing to read it to completion months ago. It's the kind of book you have to force yourself to read to see if there is something worthwhile further on. Attempts at humor fall flat most of the time. Find something else to read.
1,Awful..... you should have an option for zero stars,"This book was a total bore. I am surprised it has stayed on the best seller list. It is degrading to Jews (I am one) and if I didn't know the author is Jewish I would say he was anti-semitic. But not only the horrible descriptions, on and on, the story plot was stupid. I kept reading hoping to find something, anything worth while, alas, as I neared the last page I realized what a waste of money and time this was.I have talked to two other people who read the book, one is Jewish the other Christian, and they too thought the book was not only redundant but disgusting and awful.Dorothy Harper, Northridge, CA"
1,"A ""kick""","I bought the book because I was intrigued by the cover and also becauseit had the word ""yiddish"" in it, of which I have a smattering of understanding.The premise of the book is interesting, a Jewish ""homeland"" in Alaskawith everything Jewish, including street names, characters, etc.I admired his artistry in his use of descriptive words which, to mewas probably the best thing,no, probably the only thing I enjoyedabout the book. I found the book to be boring, disjointed, and tediousto read and could hardly wait to finish.I had not read any of his other books, nor do I intend to.I call it a ""kick"" because that's what I'm going to do--kick it intoa publc library as soon as I can so maybe others may enjoy it,because I did not."
4,Michael Chabon Writes Another Book,"I read the 'The Final Solution' and didn't like it, but this book is different than that book. It is a much larger and nicer book. If you are familiar with trucks, 'The Final Solution' would be like a Ford Ranger, and 'The Yiddish Policemen's Union' would be more like an F250 or even an F350, both of which are diesel and very powerful. 'The Yiddish Policeman's Union' is the second best book I have read this year, behind Tao Lin's 'Eeeee Eee Eeee', which is also like an F350, but with a dragon or cool picture of a boat painted on the hood."
2,Nah,"I've read most of Chabon's stuff, including the disappointing ""Summerland."" Most impressive was K&C;, though ""Wonder Boys"" was, for me, the most enjoyable. This one I've set aside about a third of the way through. Am reminded of an exchange in ""Blazing Saddles:""Taggart: I got it.Hedley Lamarr: What?Taggart: Let's kill every first born male child in Rock Ridge.Hedley Lamarr: Nah, too Jewish."
3,Nu,"Chabon's prose is the star in this book. I just love the way he turns a sentence. That said, the plot was a bit flaky. It just didn't seem to stand up to Mr. Chabon's beautiful writing-kind of like putting a mink coat on a hog......."
5,Listen to the audio CD,"This is a great book which is absolutely enhanced by listening to it on audio CD. The guy who reads it gets the accent spot on, make the book all the more hilarious. The story is funny and touching, with a whodunnit plot that moves at a brisk pace. I can't say enough good things. But do listen to it--this is a book that is made better by listening."
5,Inventive and Fun,"A thoroughly enjoyable read, enhanced if you have some knowledge of Yiddish.Michael Chabon turns a phrase in a manner that amazes me.""By now they were staunch Alaskan Jews, which meant they were utopians, which meant they saw imperfections everywhere they looked.""Many of my family members were utopians ..."
3,Well written but not what it should have been,"It usually takes me a while (in this case months) to think rather I like a book or not. I bought this the first week it came out, having loved Chabon's earlier works like Mysteries of Pittsburgh and Werewolves in Their Youth. I also was intrigued by what I heard about the setup-it brought to mind Phillip Roth's brilliant Plot Against America.But then it turned into a so-so murder mystery with a drab leading character and a bunch of caricatures out of a Mel Brooks movie. It was well written but hard to care.Also as a side note. Am I the only one to notice the similarity to The Big Nap--the second of Ayelet Waldman's Mommy-Track books in that her detective ventures into a Jewish enclave and seems to run into a conspiracy involving a young person. Just funny considering Miss Waldman is Mrs. Chabon."
4,Gorgeous prose,"If you read fiction for the plot elements or a compelling story, skip this one. If, however, you read fiction for the dizzying exhibition of a writer using language like a chisel, creating a gorgeous piece of art in the process, then you shouldn't skip this one. Buy it and savor it.Chabon again displays his almost eiree ability to craft new phrases and force the reader to just submit and go along for the ride (paraphrased - ""his voice was molten rubber dropped into a bucket of ice"").The story of Jews relocated to Sitka, Alaska forms an interesting backdrop, if for no other reason than for the sheer audacity of its historical recrafting. The detective/noir style never suffers under its own weight, as it might from the heavier-handed.One is left wanting a good yiddish phrase book, however!"
5,Go With the Flow,"Like many reviewers, I found this book hard to follow, but I gave it a chance and found myself getting into the flow of the story. What I was confused about, I let go, and then I was swept into the telling of an amazing tale. I eventually found it hard to put down.After finishing the book this morning, one of the wonderful things I love about reading happened regarding the journey it takes you on and the connections it forges. I watched Bill Moyers Journal which I had taped and was amazed to watch the short film about John Hagee and CUFI, Christians United for Israel and Moyers' discussion with Rabbi Michael Lerner and Dr. Timothy Weber. Suddenly Michael Chabon's story did not seem so outlandish. Suddenly I was sore afraid."
4,I liked it,"This was an interesting read, extremely well-written. The characters were terrific- multi-dimensional, not 100% likable. The concept of a world without Israel and the Jews living in Alaska was fascinating. The detail and thought of what it would look like and how it would play out kept me reading.My only criticism, and this is not of the author, but rather my own laziness, is that it was difficult to understand the Yiddish references. I'm Catholic and my lack of knowledge of Judaism also played a part. I didn't know what was fiction and what was real.I actually enjoyed this more than Kavalier and Clay- it was more creative."
4,Cool story.,"I'll be honest I havn't finished the book yet but I am pretty close. His writing style is fun to read and he has some good analogies/anecdotes. The only downside with this book is that I don't know much about Jewish customs, traditions, or names and so some things get lost in the translations when talking about any of the above, or items relating to Jewish culture. Don't let that stop you though its fun to read. Also maybe try to find a paperback instead."
2,Doesn't add up to much in the end,"Chekhov said that if there's a gun in the first act, somebody had better use it later on. Chabon violates this principle completely. While the Yiddish Policemen's Union is imaginative and literate, it also completely fails to follow through on its provocative premise that in nine weeks potentially the entire Jewish population of Alaska is going to be expelled. More worth reading for the atmosphere than the story."
4,It's funny,Chabon has a wonderful gift for unlikely metaphors that will make you laugh out loud and an imagination that creates an alternate history with intricate and plausible detail.
4,What if,After the Holocaust what if instead of being spread all over the World to whatever countries would take them coupled with what if Israel had lost the war of independence a temporary homeland for the Jewish people was established in Alaska. Start with this premise and add a murder mystery and it makes for a very good read.
3,An Acquired Taste,"It was hard to get into this book. Neither the setting (mostly unrelieved gloom)nor the characters (Not Nice People) made an attractive first impression, and the plot showed so few signs of life that I almost gave it up a third of the way through.However, something kept drawing me back to it. As my mind's eye adapted to the dark atmosphere I started to find things to admire -- grim humour, an odd sense of honour, and dogged resilience in an (apparently) lost cause -- that kept me going right to the end.Not an easy read, not even enjoyable, but certainly memorable."
4,such a fiction,"I can appreciate the creation of a convoluted combination of yid intellects facing career suicide as a context in which people sometimes speak American to express the perverse reality in which Christians mildly expect to cheer up at the end of the world. I started reading the book a week ago in homage to the darkest part of the year. Minnesota is not Alaska, but it has snowed and been cold this winter. Finding perverse pleasure in a situation that avoids existing people but explores many aspects of literary life with chess as an illustration of how people use their minds to visual the nature of problems that reach back to ancient religion to make black hats a symbol for strict social control that gives an author opportunities to drop comic comments on some relationships that really wish supernatural powers were helping to end what is going on instead of sucking up anything Kant would consider a fetish made The Yiddish Policemen's Union worth reading for me."
2,Bad narration on CD version,"It's hard to believe that Peter Riegert has never met a Filipino, or that he couldn't at least have done some research. His ""Filipinos"" talk like Chinamen from old Charlie Chan films and sometimes lapse into what Riegert calls ""TAG-a-log."" Is this the work of a professional?"
4,Contains one of my favorite sentences of all time...,"""The obscure unease that Pluto has always inspired, a dog owned by a mouse, daily confronted with the mutational horror of Goofy.""pretty much sums it up I felt."
3,The Yiddish Policemen's Union by Michael Chabon,"Michael Chabon continues his unique writing style, which once you get more or less used to it, becomes an entertaining story."
3,Too Cutsey,"Hard to fathom and follow, thanks to too many cutesy Yiddish expressions and associations. And I'm familiar with Yiddish."
1,Just draining,I tried. Swear to God. I sat through 100 plus pages before I put this going nowhere novel down. (and I really wanted to like it...Really did) It was so painfully slow and the subject matter so tedious I could never follow the mystery. I understand that to fans this makes me dull witted and lacking in cerebral structure and they might be right but I found it impossible to get through. Nice cover art.
1,I'd rather give it 0 stars,"I really cannot say one positive thing about The Yiddish Policemen's Union. I finished it, and I'm glad it's over. Plot, character, concept, multiple-genre (romance/mystery/crime) - all poorly executed. I was intrigued by the idea of a parallel/alternate history, but Chabon failed to create a world distinguishable from our own. the yiddish element was cheesy, distracting, and did not add meaning or mirth. Please save your time, and read something else."
1,NOT CRAZY ABOUT THIS BOOK,"I'm not Jewish and I don't know Yiddish at all. Apparently, unless you have one or both of those qualifications, you may not like this book. I've gotten far in the book but I'm waiting still to like the story or for something to happen to make me understand all the good reviews. Seeing Mr. Chabon's tight smile on the book insert at the end seems to be trying to reassure that it will get better but I think it won't. I am leaving a bad review b/c I think I know at this point that I will never get into the book although I understand the basic story but can't get any enjoyment out of it since I don't understand what they're really saying."
1,"I tried. I really, really tried",I love Michael Chabon's novels. I know a lot of Yiddish. I am a fan of black humor and alternative history. But after struggling through 75 pages of this book I have decided to give up. Maybe I'll wait a year or so and try again. Or maybe I'll just wait for Chabon's next novel.
1,The Yiddish Policemen's Union,"Snooooooooze-o-rama!This book cured my insomnia.While I liked Kavalier and Klay, I thought it was overly wordy but somewhat entertaining.This book is just wordy, dull and indulgent."
1,A very boring book,"I was really excited to read Michal Chabon's new book when I started reading it in 2008. Now, almost four years later, I still have twenty pages left to read. It took me almost four years to finish this 400-page book because it is just so boring. It may truly be the most boring book I have ever read. I am hardly able to read two or three pages before I fall asleep. There's no tension in this book, no characters that I could relate to in any way. By using tons of Yiddish idioms, Chabon creates a plot that is extremely hard to follow (in additional to being very dull). The plot sounds great on paper, but Chabon's style in this book is just terrible. In The Yiddish Policemen's Union Chabon clearly fails to grab the reader's attention. All in all my recommendation is to skip this book. It is not worth reading."
3,"Good, not great.","Michael Chabon is a wonderful writer and has a way with words. The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay is the best book I have ever read and this book disappoints. I only really had a problem with the flat ending of the book, anti-climatic to say the least. Still an interesting read and a daring subject to tackle, changing history in a unique manner but a let down none the less."
4,Would it have been so hard to include a glossary?,"I felt the cold,recognized the people, tasted the food, knew the restaurants, and experienced the city and landscape. I have never been to Alaska. My exposure to Yiddish comes from living in NYC. A one page glossary of the terms would have been helpful. Why not?"
1,The Yiddish Policemen's Union,"This was a mildly entertaining novel. It has way too many Yiddish words for easy reading. It would have been nice to have a note inserted early in the novel that there was a Yiddish dictionary in the back of the book. Even there not all words are explained. The reviews said it was ""hugely entertaining"". It was not. It was imaginary but weird. Suggest one pass on this one."
1,worst book i've read in a long time,i am a huge fan af michael chabon and have read most of his books. this book seems to have been written by someone else. it was a terrible plot line and was almost writted in a different language. it was a terrible disappointment and hope he corrects this in future novels.
2,a 'shtunk',"This novel, unfortunately, is a stinker. Great setting and concept, and that is the stroke of genius -- one can really sense Sitka as a time and place. But the plot ultimately doesn't flow. While the plotline is linear, the characters (other than central) are forgettable, their names as well as plot details overly complicated, the story doesn't make sense. Plus it exploits and stereotypes very sensitive groups, which is so distasteful post 9/11, and especially those of us in NY who live with these groups everyday. I adored (!!!) Kavalier & Clay, and Chabon's delicate use of historical metaphor and character. In this book, subtlety is thrown to the wind for purpose of genre and parody."
1,Really wanted to like this,"I had heard all kinds of great things about this book. I am not jewish but have been fascinated by jews and their traditions for many years and am also a fan of alternate universes. This book bothered me - firstly, everyone calls each other ""yid"". I don't know how jews feel about this but it was disconcerting. Also, it would have been helpful to have a glossary in the back for the ""jewish"" words. Finally, I found this book hard to follow and basically gave up 3/4 of the way through when I really didn't care any more ""who did it"""
1,Very disappointing,"I was expecting to like this book very much, because I loved Kavalier and Clay, and the premise sounded intriguing. But I was very disappointed. The characters lacked depth, and I felt like the author was showing off what a clever writer he was, without really saying anything important or interesting. Futhermore, I was offended by his characterization of Orthodox Jews as gangsters. When I got to the end I felt like I had wasted my time."
2,Average mystery,"Peel away all the Yiddish jargon and what I found left was your average cozy mystery. I understand a lot of Yiddish and I still found myself having trouble following the dialogue. It was confusing keeping all the names straight. ""Yid"" this and ""Yid"" that - everywhere like too much salt on the meat. OY. And please, with all the Yiddish jargon to make us feet right at home in fantasy-land Jewish Alaska, and then he writes about ""noodle pudding""? What?!?! Why not just say kugel? For goodness sakes. I found this book tedious to read and get through. Ultimately a somewhat satisfying mystery. But I don't get all the hype unless it's just for the sake of uniqueness. Sorry."
2,I expect better from this author,"Hard to believe I put it down with only 75 pages left, but I did. Chabon is much too taken with his own gifted writing in this book. My expectations were so high after the superb Wonder Boys and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay that perhaps I'm overly negative. Maybe if I were Jewish I would have appreciated this book more, but I'm not and I didn't."
3,"Chabon, Please Lose The Genre Shackles","I'm a fan of Chabon, but the genre elements of TYPU grew tiresome for me. The characters talk like B-grade Don DeLillo and their psychology is often a distillation of noir cliches. To me, the appeal of Chabon's writing has always been its beautiful fluidity and imaginativeness. That's still here in TYPU, but it's heavily leavened with a copland machismo that does not feel honest or effective."
2,Overestimated... unfortunately,"My expectations were great, and so was my disappointment: I just could not finish it! It is well written, of course, the prose is worth reading, but the story is simply going nowhere and it is terribly boring.So, unless you want to punish yourself for unfathomable reasons, don't waste any of your precious time on this book!"
3,Disappointed,"I loved The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, so my expectations for this novel were high. Alas, I am disappointed. These characters are hard to live with and the plot seems contrived. It has too many rabbit-from-the-hat tricks that I would expect from Stephen King, who I do not read.I like Kavalier and Clay so much, though, that I plan to try other Chabon novels."
2,Not unless you are jewish.,"Since I am not familiar with the jewish lifestyle and customs, I found the book very hard to follow. I spent a lot of time researching jewish terms."
2,The Yiddish Policeman's Union - a novel,It is difficult to read more than a chapter or two at any one time. The use of the Yiddish terms is not always appropriately applied and loses the meaning of the sentence in which it was used.
2,"beautifully written, terribly boring...","I loved The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, and I also liked The Final Solution, which was a mystery novella by Chabon, so I was excited to read this. Of course, it's amazingly written. I give the prose five stars. But that's not enough to save it. To put it simply, the story is just terribly boring. It never gets interesting. Around page 300, I said to myself, ""Okay, it's gotta start picking up soon."" But it just didn't. It's not that I don't appreciate great prose. I do. But I don't see much point in reading beautiful words that tell a boring story when I could be reading beautiful words that tell an interesting story, like his other works or works by other authors. I'm not giving up on Chabon though. I'll probably read the next book he writes. I just hope it's more interesting than The Yiddish Policemen's Union."
2,A Disappointment,"As a huge fan of KAVALIER & CLAY who made her entire book club read it and fall in love, I was really disappointed with Mr. Chabon's latest. I found the writing to be unexpectedly dense, at times over-written with an abundance of descriptive language that dragged the story down. I wanted to like the story, as I thought the revisionist premise of a post-WW II Jewish district in Alaska was intriguing. But the main story kept changing direction, and I found myself just not caring by the time it finally showed itself in the end. The main character of Meyer Landsman was compelling, and the mysterious murder victim was interesting, but the rest of the characters were pretty flat. This was the first time in a long time that I really had to force myself to finish a book, because there were many times I wanted to put it down."
4,Alternate history made interesting,"Landsman, with all of his flaws, is a character who gets under your skin and quickly becomes that lovable underdog that you love to cheer on. The culture, language, uncertain future for the Sitka Jews, and setting are great characters too, bringing a richness that most stories (regardless of the format) simply don't have these days.The murder mystery felt lost at times but always pulled itself out, which made the main plot feel less important than the setting. This was the only flaw I found with this book. However, it did give the sensation that I was reading page after page of description that didn't have any real meaning. Ultimately, this does resolve itself. The murder does get solved.I understand how this novel won both the Hugo and Nebula award. All of its elements of alternate history and the fantastic push The Yiddish Policeman's Union into a place where a book about cops becomes a wonder of soft science fiction."
3,Kept me reading,"The story was inventive--the relocation of Jews to Alaska. Alaska of all places?! There are more than 200 reviews of this book and many seem to be gushing about this book--saying that Chabon is a genius.Well, I disagree. He's a storyteller sure, but a gifted genius? No. I pushed through this book thinking it will get better, it will get better. It starts off and I felt like my copy was missing a pivotal section that somehow better explained things or just plain set things up better. I am not a huge fan of this author (I prefer Ayelet Waldman's work, his wife), but the gushing critic reviews made me think that this was a must read book.I found the story choppy at times. If you like the crime noir genre this is your book. Overall, I was glad it was a fast read at my local library, since it's definitely not a book that I'd add to my personal library."
4,The world construction rules,"It's a strange book, but strangely attracting. Fantastic alternate world, juicy characters and only the plot seems to sometimes loose its pace for me. But the funny thing is it doesn't really matter, as the worldbuilding is interesting enough to make me want to know more about it, despite the action flaws. All in all it was a very satisfying read."
2,The atmosphere is well-done,"Unfortunately the plot is not. Starts off with a homicide case, throws in an extra one with no impact on the plot (but it does give the protagonist a chance to shoot someone), veers off into crazy conspiracy theory nutjobbery, and finally runs out of gas and pulls over to the side of the road without resolving anything.The Yiddish was fun, the alternate history take was fun, but at the core the plot needed another couple trips to the kitchen."
3,A detective novel,"Interesting primarily because of the novel futuristic societal setting in which the action takes place. Otherwise the noir style is overdone, and the story itself middling in keeping one's interest."
3,Glossary Needed - Please!,"One word sums up this book..confusing. There are lots of Yiddish words that I either skipped over, eventually figured out, or sometimes looked up on the internet. The Yiddish words, coupled with the unfamiliar last names, made the book a chore to get through. I even looked at the back of the book to see if there was a glossary, which I think would have been helpful.At the end, when the murder was solved, I thought, ""Who?"" In the very last sentence of the book, the main character tells another character, ""I have a story to tell you."" I presume he is getting ready to explain everything to someone. I wish he would explain it to me because I don't have a clue."
5,a real find,"I picked up this book after seeing the title recommended again and again. It is not only an intriguing story but is well-written as well. Chabon has that rare ability to pack a lot into every sentence, never wasting a word. I thought his style was a little hard to read at first, but once I got into it, I was rewarded over and over by his mastery of the language and his ability to tell a terrific story.I immediately got a copy of his pulitzer prize winner, which is an easier style to read. Chabon is a real find if you like well-written literature.Slynn"
4,Tales of the Rapture,"Preceding the Reversion/Rapture, the messiah is taken to Heaven. Only the messiah is a drughead, and he's taken with a bullet on the head. So, somebody has to clean up the mess, and find out who did it. And the task falls to Meyer Landsman. From there follows a hard boiled novel with all the usual ingredients, tough cops with porkpie hats, snub-nosed bad guys, but once again the tough cops are not so tough (in fact, they barely shot anybody) and the snub-nosed bad guys are hassidim scholars. All in all, a very well fleshed-out uchrony, with fitting language, which does not dissapoint."
4,a good mystery read,"This book by Michael Chabon was a different kind of police mystery - it is Jewish. This is a good, if different, read and one that I enjoyed. The characters are good and the plot is interesting.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
4,"A little this, a little that","I absolutely loved Mr. Chabon's poetic prose; wonderful words that instantly paint perfect pictures and create emotion, both humorous and hurtful. It was a little long for a mystery."
3,Just okay,I thought the story would have better without so much time describing each situation. A little to wordy for my taste.
2,Yiddish Policemen,"A very esoteric book that i hoped could be good and informative reading, but I stopped reading after a couple chapters. Maybe for others a good book"
3,"BOOM, BOOM, BUST","I loved this novel until the climactic sequence. The similes fly as thick as fireflies on a Kansas summer night, the characters are as different as fingerprints, and the fictional world is as rich as New York City in the snow. The clichés are re-engineered. Landsman the detective is a divorced drunk. How many of those have you seen? But these clichés are so fresh you don't notice them. I lost interest after Landsman gets on the bush plane and flies up to investigate something that seems completely outside the world of the novel. The real problem is that this remarkably talented writer forgets that a novel, whether mystery or mainstream, has to dig deeply into human nature and reveal something about the human condition. In a mystery, that human truth must be gritty and close to the bone. If we don't arrive at some human truth, the novel melts in your hand like snow."
2,Good Premise; Imprecise Execution,"I had heard about this book and this author, and figured I would get around to reading it. What prompted me to actually buy it was the coupon from Borders I received for reviewing the first four chapters.These first chapters were intriguing. I naturally thought the whole book was going to be like this - a unique combination of various genres. Being of Eastern European Jewish descent myself, I looked forward to a lot of the Jewish in-jokes other reviewers have mentioned.Unfortunately, as others have also mentioned, the tone became as dreary as the weather, and there was virtually no payoff to plodding through to the end.I will defintely read his other works. They all can't be winners."
5,Great read,"This is a very funny and very enjoyable book.Of course, to get the humor you probably need to know who Emanual Lasker was and what a landsman is. Growing up Jewish in Brooklyn makes this even better. Especially if you had also read Raymond Chandler. The ending however, is a little bit illogical and seems to come out of nowhere."
4,Couldn't stop thinking about it,"I really enjoyed this book. It's the first of the author's that I've read. The best books are the ones that you think about even when you're not reading them, or long afterwards. And this was one of those."
5,A delicious meshuga melange of Yiddish and Alaskan.,"You won't be unintentionally jarred by the interpolation of Yiddish and Alaska. For all the strangeness of its alternative-history setting, the plot is as finely crafted as if it had been put together with woodworking tools. I mean this plot is as good as one by Thackeray. It's a love story, a good one. I did figure out the main aim of the conspiratorial combination long before it was revealed. There is not a dull character in the whole thing. This book was a superlative choice for a poolside book on my Alaskan cruise vacation."
4,The Yiddish Policemen's Union: A Novel,"This book has a slow start, but it picks up speed and keeps you intrigued 'till the end. All in all a good read.NOTE: It does need an English/Yiddish glossary/dictionary, after all: not everyone is familiar with Yiddish and the Orthodox Culture...NU?"
2,I read but...,Didn't think much of this laggy plot. Thought the characters were trite. But I still read on. The writing is above average.
3,you call this yiddish?!,"Am I the only one who read this book and thought that all Jews must hate themselves, or at least that Chabon must think that they do? Although the language and writing of this book was beautiful as many reviews have said, that was about all the book had to offer. And even the beautiful language distracted from the story, which might not be a bad thing. I read the entire book with the feeling that I must be missing something, and I can only imagine what someone who's not Jewish would have felt, with all the Jewish allusions and Yiddish terms sprinkled in. Yet even that failed to seem real to me. Although the speech of some of the characters occasionally had a real Yiddish flavor to it, the book as a whole did not, even though we were supposed to believe that the characters all thought and spoke in Yiddish all the time. For ""what if"" fiction like this, I'd stick to Roth's Plot Against America, a somewhat less flawed book."
3,Chabon trying to write like somebody else,"Of course, Chabon is always a writer worth reading, but this book is a disappointment compared to Kavalier and Clay. There is no original voice here. It's Chabon trying to be a Jewish Martin Cruz Smith. Well written but just not as magical as I expected from such a wonderful writer."
1,Disappointing...,"One thing I truly hate to do is give up on a book. In fact it's rare that I do, but unfortunately, I gave up on this one after about 115 pages. I simply could not get into the story (and this was after trying to read it for 5 days.) One reviewer mentioned that the author should consider a yiddish dictionary for those, like me, who are yiddish-challenged and I have to agree. There were so many words that I was unfamiliar with that it made it that much harder to get into the story. Truly a disappointment since I had really looked forward to reading this. An interesting premise that just didn't work for me."
1,Very disappointed,"My book club selected this book based on the strength of ""The Adventures of Cavalier & Clay"" and because Chabon is such a gifted writer. I was very disappointed with this book.This follow-up to the Pulitzer winner is regrettably self-indulgent. Not sure who the intended audience is but it wasn't me. It seemed like Chabon couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a fantasy, an homage to 40's detective mysteries or a love story. In my view, he did none of these. And the ending is so preposterous that it exceeded my 'willing suspension of disbelief' limits to such a degree as to insult my intelligence.All that said, there are a few passages that are sheer magic but all they do is remind you that this is a failed attempt by a very gifted writer."
1,Contrived attempts at Humor,This is an attempt to be humorous which falls flat in his contrived use of Yiddish words and idioms which for most readers should have provided a glossary of italicized words.Of course the idea was a preposterous story but any humor interspersed in the pointless detective story was lost. I grew up with parents who spoke Yiddish and I didn't recognize many of the words as they were used.I plowed through the book only because of a compulsion to finish anything once started and was implored by my wife to give it up as I moaned and complained.I did not read his first book but reading this casts doubts on the Pulitzer prize committee.
2,Highly unlikely,"The author created such an unbelievable scenerio for this book that it was too difficult to accept. Fantasy is fine; sci-fi is fine, but this was neither; it seemed to be trying to be passed off as real world. As a result it flopped - for me anyway. The author has talent; he shouldn't waste it on nonsense."
1,A strange time indeed...,"I bought this book because of the wonderful reviews and publicity it received. YIKES!!! Was I disappointed! If Chabon had submitted any part of this book as a freshman English paper, he would have received an ""F"" for his diction. The story was interesting and I did finish it, but the language was forced and jerky in its tempo. It is a strange time to be a Jew ...or not..."
1,The Yiddish Policeman's Union,I am stuggling to read this book because it is not holding my attention. The author is not drawing me in what-so-ever. Some things are overly described and others are not explained well. It is hard to follow. I have had to skim sections in hope to get to a more engaging part of the book. I have yet to find the more engaging part of the book. I do not recommend this book.
1,not good,"This novel is vastly overrated. I do not like novels in which the tone of the novel is one of belittling and condescending. It just did not interest me at all. I wanted to like it, I am interested in Jewish life, Interested in alaska, but the authors attitude was evident in the book and I did not like that tone of one upmanship. Totally boring."
4,Fun Read,This book was a pleasure to read. Chabon's writing is witty and rich in substance without being unnecessarily long-winded. The self-loathing of the main character (and that charater's reflection on same) is simply fantastic. I am now going to begin reading everything else Chabon has written.
4,Oy Veh!!,Chabon is very clever here and the interplay between the characters and their motives skirt brilliance. What endures about the novel is the atmosphere and the feeling that we are facing finalities.
2,Th Yiddish Policemen's Union,This book was recommended to me and I was very disappointed in it. I found the sentences went on forever and were hard to understand. I was confused as to why the Jews were where they were and in fact it was hard to determine who were the Jews and who were not. Who were the bad guys and who were the good guys. I'm still not sure what the purpose of this book was.
5,Great fun,"This is one of the most peculiar, most fun, and in places sweetly sad pieces of fiction I have read in years. It is like life itself: a tragedy with elements of farce. It is a weird sort of noir detective story set in an alternate universe where an obscure plan from the Roosevelt Administration was carried out and part of Alaska, rather than Palestine, became the Jewish homeland.Characters include a sort of Jewish Phillip Marlowe with a warped sense of humor and a bush pilot sister who is three times the man he is, Orthodox Jewish Native Americans, Hassidic rebbes who are also gangsters, born-again Christian G-men, a occult master of string, chess prodigies, an alleged talking chicken, and a reluctant almost-but-not-quite Messiah. All of this and lots of cold, rain, and salmon. What could be better?"
3,A new world,"Welcome to Alaska, the temporary home of a large Jewish colony now on the edge of repatriation. Chabon has set his sights high, again, but this time there seem to be so many pieces to put in place, so many portraits to paint in his newly formed universe, that at times the book feels more like a heavy wade than a pleasure. Sure, we all know Chabon can write his contemporaries off the page, but I have the feeling this will be remembered as a novel that landed just wide of the target. If you're going to play with a genre like mystery, you take on not just machinations of plot, but also of pacing and that's my main gripe despite the gorgeous prose. After 150 pages of a mystery, you'd usually like to know more than that the story revolves around the body of a former chess player. It's hard to think of a writer with Chabon's skill doing anything that isn't deliberate, but just because he sets his new world in Alaska, did it have to move at such a glacial rate?"
2,There are better Stephen Bishop compilations,"You can't really argue with the song selection here, but the sound is a step down from the other two Stephen Bishops CD compilations I own. The earlier MCA CD On And On / The Hits Of Stephen Bishop sounds warm and open and there is a nice natural level of hiss on the quieter acoustic tracks such as ""Madge,"" which is one of my favorite songs. By contrast, the 20th Century Masters sounds a little ""cold"" and there seems to be some clipping in the high frequency transients, especially noticeable on the drums and cymbals. Also, I couldn't hear any hiss at all, which makes me wonder if they used noise reduction in the mastering of this CD. I would stick with either On And On or the earlier Rhino Best Of Bish which contains the single mix of ""On And On"" and the superior movie version of ""Separate Lives."""
3,It Might Be You,"I bought this album for that one song from the movie Tootsie that he performed and co-wrote, ""it Might Be You""."
5,Cash + Clash = Waco,"This is the CD that started it all. ""To The Last Dead Cowboy,"" the Waco Brother's first CD, set a standard that has been hard to match. In fact only ""Cowboy In Flames,"" their third disk, matches this CD's energy and spirit. The Waco's literally marry the country purity of legends like Johnny Cash with the tempo and attitude of bands like The Clash. This marriage of punk and country (an idea first envisioned by the likes of Jason and the Scorchers) as interpreted by lead Waco (and Mekon punker) Jon Langford and his band mates, ultimately produces great rock and roll that transcends musical categorization. This is the album that established the Waco Brothers as the standard bearers of insurgent country and has secured them a place in the hearts of left-wing country punkers everywhere."
4,great package,"Bought these for a friend. Tried to buy them from a local car parts store, but they would have to special order the for me taking up to 6 weeks. I searched amazon and found them for about 10% less than the store said they could order them for and I got them in less than a week. They are in the jungle lighting the way for a frind on safari."
4,Turkish rock with heavy sounds!,"Some friends of mine equate Bunalim to an arabian Black Sabbath. This is some of my fave World music from the best musical period of late 60's to early 70's. Lots of great guitar, heavy bass lines, great beats."
3,they're okay...,"These cups do keep liquids cold a lot longer than the regular Take & Toss cups. However, the lids do not fit as tightly, and pop off a lot more easily when thrown to the ground by a rambunctious toddler. I still give it 3 stars, though, because I haven't had this problem when using the regular Take & Toss lids with these cups. As a matter of fact, the straw lids with the insulated cups is the perfect combination for smoothies. I just wish the thicker lids that came with these insulated cups fit a little better."
2,Good idea bad product,"I got these cups for my 15 mo old son. I thought that they would be great, a nice cup to take with us when we go out that I would not mind if we lost. I bought two packs and opened them right up, wash them, and then handed one to my son while he was sitting at the table. Not even two seconds later he had pulled the cap off and dumped the cup. This would be a great idea if the lids screwed on like the other sippy cups. The lids are really easy to take off. I would not recommend this cup to anyone unless you want a cup that your kids can open and you want to sit right next to them when ever they use this cup. Me I would just rather give him a regular cup he can not make any more of a mess. I love the other take and toss items and an really disappointed in this one."
4,A great reference utility,"This reference set provides the reader with a complete guide to the controls used in each of the 5 programming languages. Even though a majority of the material is taken from the MSDN cd-roms, their is never a substitute for having a physical book in your hand to look at as you go. The MSDN online reference is much more confusing and is not organized nearly as well. Anyone that is looking to have a set of books to use as reference/referral to common functions should definitely get this complete set. All this needed was more code samples to get my 5 star vote."
5,This CD was my intro to the Waco Brothers...,"I first heard the title track on the 'Local Anesthetic' show on WXRT radio in Chicago a couple of years ago. The song stuck with me, so I decided to get the CD. Years later, I still listen to that song over and over, again, without getting sick of it. Needless to say, that's never happened before! I have to agree with the other reviewer who said that the title track is strong enough to justify buying the album."
5,Probably one of the creepiest films I've ever watched - and I loved it!,"Robert Mitchum is SO creepy in this film - even as an adult watching the film, his character gives me the heeby-jeebies!There's something about the way this film was shot that is just exquisite. It is a black and white film but I'd still recommend it to those (like my husband) who hate watching black and white movies. The children are not the most amazing child actors, but once you let yourself get past that this film is utterly enjoyable and haunting. That feeling will stay with you for a while even after you've put the dvd back on the shelf."
4,"original, good, frightening","I've always liked Robert Mitchum and Charles Laughton. With this being Laughtons only gig as director how could I refuse?A tight story that puts you on an emotional roller coaster. You find yourself furious at the various characters for various reasons and asking your self how can people be so stupid. The not so subtle message coming through is that people believe what they want to, because it is easier then facing the truth. But..when the truth is finally faced, there is hell to pay.The Cinematography is excellent and the acting is top notch. Winters is superb as the longing and insecure widow, Mitchum is creepy, menacing and charismatic.The only negative aspects are the occasional overlong scenes such as the river montage and brother-sister dialogues.Overall a great movie; you'll keep a closer eye on your kids after watching this one, I guarantee it."
4,scared me when I was a kid,"I remember watching this movie for the first time - probably 30 years ago as a child. Thanks for putting it on DVD. A little dated but still outstanding. Some reviewers seem to loose their perspective when reviewing old movies.Night of the Hunter spins a suspenseful tale about demented preacher (Robert Mitchum) who gives a strong performance.""Chil Dren, Chil Dren......"""
3,this film needs a Criterion release,"I am a huge fan of NIGHT OF THE HUNTER - I have been ever since I saw as a small child at the movies in the late 50s -- it is a classic noir with indelible images and haunting imagery-- the barebones release by MGM back in the day doesn't begin to do this masterwork justice - for one thing, it is not letterboxed and it has been shown for many years now on TCM in that format...Criterion could certainly find much to add to the appreciation of Charles Laughton's only directed film -- maybe they could track down the children - Billy Chapin and Sally Jane Bruce - and also ask Peter Graves to do commentary and a making of documentary---before it is too late."
3,Based on a 1920's serial killer.,"This movie is based on a 1920's serial killer who lived and murdered in Clarksburg, West Virginia. The real one raped, tortured and killed at least 6 women and children, maybe more. This 1950's movie is watered down and is not nearly as frightening as the real ""Harry Powers."""
2,Sappy & crappy.,"I adore Robert Mitchum and I do not disagree with much that has been written here, but the religion was laid on with a trowel. So hokey. So corny. The angelic voices, the hymns...Lillian Gish looking up to heaven...please! What I thought would be film noir turned out more like a rally for George Bush Jr.!"
2,Night after Night after Night of the Hunter...,"It had it's moments for me... Was Lillian Gish the older lady who kept took all the orpans in there at the end of the movie who had the face-off w/ Mitchum? (He was lookin' good in this movie...) - I love how crisp it was filmed and how clear the scenes of the town and the time were captured. But I did almost condone his brutal slaying of Shelley Winters after her prayerful speechifyin' while laying down to sleep. And Peter Graves was comically stiff in his brief moment of ""where to hide all this dough?"" - in the way he answers his own questions instantly."
1,Hank the Crank,"I hate to be a stick in the mud and a crank but...UNTIL THEY PUT OUT A WIDE SCREEN DVD! Boycott this until they do!!! The picture is beutiful and the sound is great. It always was! The fraction diference DVD provides is nice BUT!!! Where is that extra third of the screen!!!! its my favorite movie BUT!!!! I've seen it in TV format. I'm outragously dissapointed! Buy the video until they take their heads out of the sand. i'll admit I didn't read the print that said it didn't include wide screen so... stupid on me. BUT!!! The very idea that they would put this classic out on TV format... MORONIC on them.... I have to admit, my mistake never crossed my mind. ......... WHY SHOULD IT!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,How Could It Possibly Have Been A Success?,"Night of the Hunter was Charles Laughton's attempt to elevate himself from actor to AUTEUR while at the same time getting on a film set with Bob Mitchum.In so doing, the faded, ill-humored, child-hating British star made other predictable moves:Turned direction of the childrens' scenes over to others because he lacked interest in them;Attached Lillian Gish as a stamp of respectability on the tawdry mess;Attempted to prove himself artistically and intellectually superior to young American Orson Welles in his startlingly transparent imitation of Citizen Kane's visual and allegorical qualities;Broke the rule about writing what you know;Substituted garish cliches for passion;Held his subjects and audience in utter contempt.Fifty years later, reviewers still don't have the guts to kick this dog."
3,Doesn't he ever sleep?,"Well, now I know where Spike Lee sampled the Love/Hate story for Radio Raheem in Do the Right Thing. It's cool how Mitchum's character successfully demonstrates the tale of love vs hate the first time, but Lillian Gish's reaction to Mitchum's second attempt is on the money, sonny.The DVD notes how Mitchum was the intermediary between the director and the child actors. Supposedly he brought out the best of their performances. But guess what...their performances (...were bad)! Ok, the boy was half-decent overall, but the girl was damn annoying...not realistically annoying, or ""that's how it was in them times"" annoying, but plain ""I'm a Hollywood brat"" annoying. No Scout or Jem here."
5,very twisted,this film is really hard to describe. on one hand you have all the corny hokey disney like elements; on the other you have a brutal noir horror film. even the expressionistic noir film takes on a disney like animation quality.
4,Cinematic Genius or Melodramic Comedy-Thriller?,I can see that this film was probably ahead of its time for 1955.I can even see where it was a little artsy...the close-ups of the animals was a stroke of quiet genius!I enjoyed this film because I thought it was Funny. I actually laughed out loud several times. The story is really over-the-top and Mitchum and Winters don't ACT very well (still early in their careers...). The kids were the BEST!I'd recommend this film for laughs.But not much else.
4,Recommended,"When I was a little girl, growing up in New Jersey, my entire family would visit my grandparents every Sunday afternoon. There was nothing to do, so my 5 sisters and I would sit in the day room and watch the Million Dollar Movie on the black & white TV. I probably wasn't more than 6 when I saw Night of the Hunter for the first time and I never forgot it. Of course I didn't have a clue what experssionism meant at the time, but that film touched a nerve. Robert Mitchum's preacher was super creepy. Recommended for those who like something dark and off balance."
2,DVD cuts out half the movie,"This is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, and by chopping off the sides to make it fit the TV screen, the producers of this DVD have deleted the power of some *very* striking images. I will keep my eyes open for a properly formatted DVD."
3,This is an odd movie,"Interesting, and somewhat engaging, but odd. Robert Mitchum's performance is over-the-top, the other performances are lackluster, except for the character of the older woman who takes the children in. Mitchum's role especially presages Robert De Niro in the reamke of Cape Fear."
5,An Amazing Cinematic Experience,"This is one of the love-it-or-hate-it films of all time. Defiantly expressionistic, with the firm, uncluttered moralistic sweep of a fairy tale, Charles Laughton's treatment of James Agee's nightmarish script is difficult to pigeonhole and hard not to respect--but very easy to dislike. I have met not a few people who find the film hokey and cornball, if not out right ludicrous. But if you submit to the dark, terrible beauty of the story (as well as Robert Mitchum's performance--one of the very best of all time) you will have an original, unsettling experience. A film like no other, and one of the true masterpieces of all time."
3,Superb Movie but Poor DVD Sound,I have seen this movie several times and have always been impressed by the haunting mystical quality of it. Everyone in the film plays their character wonderfully and the LOVE HATE hands have become legend. However my disappointment comes in the sound quality. In the DVD I have the background soundtrack overpowers the dialogue to the point of discomfort and makes it difficult to enjoy the movie.
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Night of the Hunter falls apart to a degree once Lillian Gish gets on screen and turns everything into a simple parable, but for the first hour or so it's an incredibly creepy film with a terrific villain by Robert Mitchum and some amazing photography; overrated a bit in some quarters, Night of the Hunter is still definitely worth a watch."
1,"Dig your southern accent, Bob","Recently saw again and then read the reviews by Maltin and assorted movie buffs; this is a real lemon! Horrible, overstated, numbing acting. Ms. Winters is her usual slob, sad self ala her portrayal in ""A Place in the Sun"". Mr. Laughton should have stuck with hammy roles and Mitchum is just godawful. Cinematography is sophomoric and the whole thing is so dark. And James Agee involved to boot! What a mess!"
1,The emperor's new clothes!,"I was utterly disapointed with this movie. It was so blindly touted by so many reviews...this could be one of the most over-rated movies ever. The acting is inconsistent and amatuerish and was embarrassing to watch. Robert Mitchum, an otherwise excellent actor goes over the top here and often parodies himself. Lilian Gish should have not come out of retirement. Shelly Winters is her usual watery mess. The children are so wooden, you can make a coffee table out of them. The editing, the continuity, the music...everything is a jumbled mess. Charles Laughton, an irritating and over-rated actor, just took a very good story with so much potential, and dragged it on the mud.If only Hitchcock made this movie, it could be up there with Vertigo!"
1,Horror or just Horrible?,"Ok, I don't know what the three other reviewers saw that I didn't see but this is an all time bad. I love film noir. I love a good thriller. I lover a good horror. Hey, I just love a good film. Night of the Hunter is dreadful. Why was it not nominated for an award? I'll tell you- bad screen play, bad acting, bad film. On a positive note- I did laugh in spots that are just too bizzar for words. I would recommend this movie just for sheer educational purposes. Please compare this movie with good film noir. (Rebecca, Gaslight etc) What was C.L. thinking????"
1,"Once again, did we see the same movie?","I am wondering if everyone who has reviewed this movie since me, like this movie because they have to because it is considered a ""classic"", like Children of Paradise, a crashing bore. Is it good considering the time in which it was made? Now, each movie is flawed to some extent because of the time in which it was made, witness Birth of a Nation--no one really, except for the blacks who couldn't afford to go to movies--really understood those white hoods. Now, I digress, please check out the acting--it is gruesome; well, I have said this before. I do love Robert Mitchum, but he needed more dialogue coaching. Elm Street was more terrifying."
4,at once beautiful and terrifying,"From an email I wrote to a friend:""You were right when you said I was going to like this. I actually think I like it a little more than you do. Despite my pretensions at being an amateur film historian, I can't remember ever hearing of this. Mitchum is completely terrifying -- mainly because he actually does believe a warped version of what he preaches. It's certainly the scariest movie I've seen in about 15 years or so, despite being around 40 years old. I had to keep stopping it because I simply couldn't take the suspense. What's new to me about this movie was that you were admiring the lyrical photography all the while scared out of your wits.""The reason I give it four stars, though, is that Laughton seemed to drop the ball in the ending: I found nearly everybody's actions in the final act both disappointing and hard to believe."
5,"Terrifyingly Beautiful, and Scary...","The entire cast did an excellent job and the director should also be applauded. The dichotomy of good and evil are well played out. The bank robber, who robs a bank for the right reason yet commits an act that sends him to death row; the Preacher who who one should be able to trustm is a murderer and then what happens to the entire Mayberry RFD like town in the end...Loved it! The children and the Preacher are the centerpiece of this marvelous feast for the eyes and senses! You really don't want to miss out on this one!"
5,still as good as ever,"The extras on this DVD are worth the price. To see how Laughton directed, particularly the childrens roles was fascinating. This movie still holds up after all these years both as suspense and horror."
4,don't take your kids to this?,"A black and whiter film noir classic that borders on horror.The preacher character played by Mitchum is a very Frankenstein like creation.I think the acting of the two children is as good as that of the adults.I had seen a trailer of this film before , but not the full version.At times your skin actually crawls watching thisand you know that is just the effect the director was aiming at."
4,creepy...,"and quite funny as well. There are some unforgettable visuals in the film (ie. Winters submerged and still seated in her car, the trip down the river, the silhouetted form of the preacher on the horizon etc. etc. etc.) True, some of the acting (the children) is bizarre and a bit wooden, but nothing about this film is even attempting to portray ""reality""...It's actually more like a funhouse mirror version of ""our world"" which distorts everything. This film is weird and wonderful!"
4,Innocence meets evil.,"The story is a rather strange mixture of innocence and evil with Mitchum in one of his nastiest roles. It's almost like he was rehearsing for his nastiest role in CAPE FEAR. He meets his match in Lillian Gish's character who stands up to him and is just as courageous and savvy as she is ""sweet"". In fact, the performances were great all around in this atmospheric film. Charles Laughton, in his only stint at directing, does an excellent job but I think he might have done more with the climax because it did seem that it could have been a little better and have more tension. A very good example of film noir."
5,Great Classic,"This is a tuly excellent classic movie. My entire family enjoyed it! Great dramatic performances from Robert Mitchum and Shelly Winters. I am so glad that movies like this are still in circulation , I just can't stomach much of what is on the silver screen today! This movie is a keeper!"
5,Absolute masterpiece and amazing blu ray transfer with loads of extras,Charles Laughton's directed this masterpiece with an amazing performance from Robert Mitchum and a standout performance by Lillian Gish. The extras on this blu ray are worth the price alone. The transfer to blu ray is incredible and does the amazing lighting true justice. I highly recommend this blu ray.
4,OOHH... chills,"Well, first off... I don't know any of the actors, don't know anything about directors, and I am not a classic film buff. But I did become unusually intrigued by this movie. While the first half was somewhat annoying because of the intended theatrical acting, the movie becomes oddly intense when the mother is murdered. I don't know why I was so into this movie... except that I enjoyed it. It was like a wooden rollercoaster (you know... old.. but it still has great kicks). The preacher was so scary... I practically screamed when he was inches away from the children... oh.. the children... they are so cute that I can't help but worry for them so much... i don't want the evil man to get them... and... well.. anyway. I thought it was pretty cool... and I figured out that the acting was intentionally over-dramatic, and the scenery was intentionally unrealistic... and I totally enjoyed it. I was completely disturbed. GREAT."
1,Flapdoodle indeed.,"Easily and far out in front the worst movie I have ever seen, and that may be an understatement.For a good laugh, watch this movie. But whatever you do, do not fall for these ridiculous 4 & 5 star reviews. These people are morons. Dont be a moron."
1,"""My whole body's just a-quiverin' with cleanness.""","As far as I can tell, this is perhaps the worst movie ever made. Even entertainment starved masses of the 50's hated it, its only taken a pack of brain dead intellectual wannabes in the last 10 years to resurrect this pile of garbage to its current legendary state.If you've never seen this thing prepare to laugh a LOT! If you have seen it, and think it passes for art, or great film-making, you need to ask yourself why Charles Laughton never directed another ""film."" Seriously the worst of all time. My apologies to all you mooks that took the time to write 5 star reviews."
2,Thin and fragile,"I ordered 4 goblets about 2 weeks ago and they were beautiful, thick and sturdy and gave them 5 stars. I ordered 4 more but these are totally different. They are the same products but are much much thinner and fragile. I couldn't believe my eyes. I ordered the exact samething and received products in much inferior quality. This company is going down.i am going to return the last order. I am so upset."
3,Almost all good,"The 20 songs in the latin version are almost all pretty good, nothing extraordinary, but good reinterpretations of Jose Alfredo's songs, well almost all, the Moderatto cover of El Rey is one of the WORST SONGS EVER!!!!Oh my good! I still cannot believe that a record label allowed this God awful song to be in an album, much less a TRIBUTE ALBUM!!!Truly Mr Jimenez was roling in his grave because of that Moderatto cover.The best are Saul Hernandez (of course), Aterciopelados, Elefante, Bunbury, rabanes, not a bad album, but that Moderatto song. DEAR GOD!!!!"
3,Practical LotusScript - for beinners only,"I was starting at zero-level, and now after two week I'm developing myown Agents under LotusScript. Hoped to receive further informationsabout the classes and programming the API under LotusScript. Good for beinners, a lot of good examples. NOT for furhter informations about the API, or the classes. As beginner, but familiar with C++ and Java, easy to start, if you have NO exerience in LotusScript, but if you are familiar with lotus notes."
2,Disappointing,"I am relatively new (3 months) both to Lotus Notes and to LotusScript but have been thoroughly comfortable with various computer languages for many years.The decision to purchase this book was strongly influenced by the generally positive reviews but, sad to say, I have to agree with the negative view. There are rather too many typos but my main grumble is that, having laboriously copied some of the examples into a database used for self-training, too many (six of 13 tried so far) fail to work. This does nothing for confidence or skill development!If you're looking for an unfrustrating quick start to LotusScript, this is not it."
1,"Bait & Switch - these are good for bait, not eating!","These are NOT true Cross-Pack sardines, and they are Scottish, not Norwegian.These are very large sardines with the front 1/3 cut-off, so they'd fit in the tin cross-wise.I have eaten hundreds of 2-layer tins from Season and King Oscar, and these are clearly inferior.Cross-Pack is supposed to be the finest, rarest grade - these aren't that.If you see these in a store, read the back label carefully!Season used to be a good brand - what a shame."
5,"The MORE layers, the smaller; the SMALLER the better.","Anyone that R=E=A=L=L=Y likes SARDINES prefers the little-bitty ones.I used to buy a brand that sold ""three-layer"" sardines.Only seen the SINGLE or DOUBLE -layer variety, lately... and, of course,the single-layer ones don't actually ADVERTISE the fact as they are justbig chunks of chum-like [bait] fish.I understand that the reason I CANNOT find three-layer sardines is be-cause they are now known as either ""tiny"" or ""cross-packed"" sardines..................................................................................................Sardines are healthy because of the oil; and the bones supply calcium--- I suppose --- hell, I just like them... The little ones, I mean.I'll just have to remember that the SMALL [good!] ones are now called""cross-pack"".................................................................................................."
1,season sardines,"terrible - not tiny as described - had 19 in can. they are cross packed, but should have 30 -32 in can to be the real good ones. KING OSCAR are the best of all - if you can find them. no more of these for me (SEASONS)ever."
4,Scary stuff,"One of my teachers suggested reading this book for a class about communicating and health care. The stories in this book are chilling, especially when one realizes that much of the suffering could have been avoided had more effective communication techniques been utilized. I think all nursing students should read this book at some point in their education."
5,Big Boy Combo Part I (Railroad Lines),Great history when the Big Boy was in its prime. Great for train lovers of all ages.
4,Nice realistic FPS,"Vietcong really shines as a realistic first person shooter. Even on my moderately high-end gaming machine I have to turn down the specs some so it isn't so sludgy on mouse movements, though. Everything is realistic and entertaining. The jungle warfare is great and unparalled in the industry. Get this pack because it includes the expansion. Overall it's an awesome game and really worth the money!"
5,Vietcong: Purple Haze,"Not only a tremendous ego-shooter this is the best action game I've ever owned! Graphics (on my system anyway) 10, Story 10, voice-acting 10, replay value 10. Lots of levels, great music/sound. Many ""quickfight "" levels and weapons to be unlocked - this game has it all at the highest quality level!"
2,Disaster story,"I bought this product offered by Office Depot and was happy until i started unpacking it,Here are the things that i recount happeninng when i started to assemble it.1) All the parts are not labeled. It took me nearly hour and half to figure out what the various pieces for.2) The screws are not packaged correct. It was like playing a puzzle , which number matches with which part3) After a couple of hours of assembly , i found out that some of the pieces were missing. Gladly i found a customer service rep on a Sunday. Hopefully i will have the parts in a few days4) To top it all , when i tried to moved this assembled product one of the leg pieces gave up and now i have a new handicapped hutchI recommend that this producuct is a waste of money,,"
4,I'm Glad I'm Mechanically Inclined....,"Good stuff! Great price! ...I brought it home at 1pm and finished assembling it at 7:30. I labeled the screws and other hardware before I started.... and yes, it would be helpful if all the parts were labeled but with a little thought, you can do it! Or call customer service! I especially liked the unique locking nuts for added stability. I jockeyed the assembled desk into the corner in stages - - first right, then left, then the middle supports. Nice & Easy. The sliding keyboard shelf doesn't work properly (probably something I missed) but I'll give a call to customer service on Monday. I like it! With a six year warranty you just can't beat the value."
4,NOKIA 6133,"This item works as advertised but is an older model not specifically designed for the 6133 as it doesn't easily clip into the phone, you have to kind of force it in but for the price it is still worth it."
1,Cell Phone USB Data Sync Cable,USB data sync Cable for Nokia phone did not work Vendor never responded to product not working.
4,Cable works great!,"I was shopping around for this cable at the mall and they wanted $32 for it and I thought personally that was a little to steep. After doing some research for this cable online I found it at amazon for just over $5 and shipping costs just over $4. So all together it came out to be just a little over $10 what a substantial about of savings. Not only the savings , but the cable works great. I can say I am VERY SATISFIED with this product. Thanks Amazon!"
5,The Amazing Marilyn Monroe,"Let's Make Love"", is a delightful film. It is funny, romantic, and adorable. It has an amazing ending!A billionaire wants to impress a stage girl, but he has no talent. He hires Bing Crosby to teach him how to sing, then Milton Berle to teach him comedy, and ofcourse the talented Gene Kelly to show him his amazing steps. At the end he tries to explain to Monroe that he is not poor, and that he is the Billionaire Montanda. She thinks he is insane. It is humorous, and lovely.Buy a couple of these tapes!"
1,Techno Belly Dance,If you prefer traditional bellydance music - give this CD a pass. There are several classics from Abdel Wahab which keeps this from receiving no stars at all.
5,"Unbelievable album, wonderful dancers...","I just love this Album. You have to have a copy of this Cd for any occasion. I got it for my daughter's birthday so she could practice bellydance at home, and I cannot stop listening to it. It just gets you moving everytime. I recommend it to anyone who is searching for a special album filled with sensational Middle-Eastern rhythms. I heard the dancers are doing the tour at the Lolapalooza this year. Gotta check them out, I saw them at the House of Blues, and they ROCKED THE HOUSE!"
3,Bellydance - jazzy or old-fashioned?,"The CD is okay for people who prefer a modern, more ""jazzy"" kind of belly dance - or modernized versions of classic titles. I like the traditional ones better - but that's probably a matter of age."
4,great starter compilation for beginners,"I'm only telling it as it is: - Bellydance Superstars is a great album for someone who's on the cusp of venturing into the world of bellydance but without having to suffer from complete musical culture shock. I've had a lot of fun with the CD, despite its commercial-oriented and aesthetic aspect (thanks to Miles Copeland). I recently saw Bellydance Superstars performance feat. Vol. 2. The performance was an additional eye-opener and well worth questioning whether you're ready to move on to the more authentic North African/ Middle Eastern fare.All in all, if you're thinking of buying the CD I would recommend that you listen to it first to see if this is what you're looking for."
5,THE BEST BELLYDANCE ALBUM EVER!!!,"I hope you all get a chance to get this album, it is the most wonderful and entertaining dance album. This bellydance album is not just for dancers, it's for everyone who just wants to listen to some good music. The variety is be far the best I've heard yet, and I've heard a lot of them. I guarantee you will love this album as much as I do!!!"
3,"Make ""Bellylicious"" CD your first choice before this one","I bought Bellydance Superstars after I had already own Bellylicious for 4 months ( which I played to death ) & frankly I was very disappointed . I really liked the majority of the songs on Bellylicious because they were really catchy , quite new & each song is by a different artist . When I bought & listened to Bellydance Superstars ( which has 1 song in common with Bellylicious - Chicky by Ooajami) , I was dismayed to find that 2 or more songs were by the same artist & the songs weren't as good probably because some traditional bellydance music was included .Let me be the first to say that I don't bellydance - I just like bellydancing music .Perhaps some songs on Bellylicious may be too fast to actually bellydance to , I'm not an expert here - whatever it is I hardly ever listen to Bellydance Superstars prefering instead the faster beats & greater variety on Bellylicious ."
3,Noisy Fan,"This fan works OK, but it is neither low speed or quiet. If you need a quiet fan look elsewhere."
2,TOO LOUD for a Low Speed fan!,"I got these fans to help ventilate my stove and these were way too loud, louder than the fridge. I thought low speed meant they would be somewhat quiet but it makes a loud hum. it moves an good amount of air and was very easy to install, the three ftt cord could be longer. I have the same size metal fan that came with my cabinet and it was much quieter than this one. Both blow about the same amount so this might be a quality or make issue."
3,Electronic cooling fan 110 V AC,"This fan really puts out the wind but it is far noisier than the fan it replaced; mea culpa, I had read reviews to that effect before I bought it."
3,Mechatronics 120x120x38mm Low Speed AC fan...,Mechatronics 120x120x38mm Low Speed AC fan...This is not for continuous use over a long period.Bought it for the desk top computer to cool the desk space it's in.It got out of balance within one ear and needed to be replaced.
2,Great service - poor quality product,"The battery arrived promptly and charged OK. The problem was that the battery held charge for much less time than 2 year old one I was trying to replace.I give it 2 stars because of the quick shipping from the seller, but the battery itself is not good. I will try B&M; store and see what happens..."
1,Blew up on me!,"Well, maybe didn't blow up, but is melted instead of charging. I sure wouldn't order form this stock again..."
3,shipping okay- product questionable,"The company shipped the battery to me fairly quickly- I think it took 5 to 7 days.I was disappointed that the battery was not in the original packaging- it was shrinkrapped in cellophane. This means I don't know if it is new or used. It seemed to work okay the frist week- but I started getting an error on my cell phone when I plugged it in to charge- saying ""non-standard battery"" but it charges up okay. I think it may be a fake SonyEricsson battery- it has a label that is different from the original - but still looks real- what can you expect for around $10.00 anyway.It seemsd to be working okay and I can get 2 days from a full charge.Doug G.P.S. I stopped getting the error message about the non-standard battery after a couple weeks. ??? may just be my phone."
1,I recevied this battery in bad condition,I was trying to buy a new battery but battery perferms much worst than original also receive in used bad condition and too much scraches.!!!i disapointed on amazon... Please do not buy in here~!!!
1,No good,This is either faulty or a cheap knock-off. It needs to be charged everythree days even when not in use.
1,Mine was lame,"I can[t speak for anybody else, but the battery I bought was as lame as the old one I was trying to replace. Finally replaced the phone :( Shipping was timely and accurate."
1,This is a waste battery,This battery is worse than the original Sony battery which I have already used it for 2 years! Dont buy.
5,Very happy,"I was extemely happy to find this battery priced so cheaply and it arrived in a matter of a couple of days. Good battery, good price, good service."
5,"Great battery, price and Quick!","The batteries (I got several) work perfectly, they are a great price, much better than getting them in the store for sure! They were delivered quickly, this is a definite way to go to get extra batteries for my camera!!"
2,below expectation,"Bought this to replace a 3 year old original battery. No significant improvement over the old one. After a full charge, it only hold up for 2 days (with average 1 or 2 ten-min call per day)."
1,sam,"Another worse product made in China.Please don't buy this battery,it's not same as your original battery, after insert to my sony erricson 750I, I have to break the battery aparts to get it out my phone compartment because it's too thick, I bought 2 pieces have a same probblem."
4,Cell Phone Battery Purchase Review,I bought this battery through Amazon.com and am pleased with the product and the bargain I got on this purchase.Thanks
3,Battery looks and performance,"I recieved the battery in time, which was the great part of order. I was expecting a ""new"" battery. Just looking at it, the battery had dents in it and did not look in the shape I expected. My old battery look better than the one I received. The new battery does perform better than my old battery, but is not as good as the new battery, which came with the phone during its purchase."
1,laser,Am not able to change out the lenses as described plus changing the battery is a challenge also
2,Fun for a week.,"I have (had) a laser VERY similar to this (same type but w/o heads)anyways bought it at at petstore for around 10$ it peaked at 5mw then just was dim the batts were VERY hard to replace.If you're looking for a laser for your pet get a red laser (not oneshaped like a bullet) Or even a green laser, just be careful of your pet's eyes because most class llb lasers can cause BAD eye damage."
2,Buffalo Veterans Court started this program,"The veterans court is a great program that was started in Buffalo NY by Judge Robert Russell in 2008. The Buffalo team, along with Justice for Vets, has trained 95 courts across the country (including Houston). I wish 60 minutes would have recognized the Buffalo team and Justice for Vets for their continuing role in this nationwide success story."
5,everyman and medieval plays,"thankyou for this opportunity.I first read this play in 1968, preceding my role as ""Fellowship"" for my school's production of 'The Reading of Everyman"", played out within our School Chapel. In later years I can now better understand about my role not knowing then, the impact that this play would have in my adult life. I am now 57 and a retired Army Chaplain(not that you really retire). Over the years I had lost the books that I had, and now through the ability of [...] I can relive those years and can more fully understand the content. thankyou."
5,Great speed and operation!,"By using the Firewire 800 I achieved to copy a 1.7GB movie from my macbook pro 2.5GHz/250GB 5400 RPM to this LaCie drive in 45 seconds. My eSATA drive connected by an express card 34 is not much faster as the Firewire 800 has a better sustained rate of speed no matter how full your external drive is. Xbench drive benchmarking shows a sustained read and write speed of 62 MB/sec via Firewire 800. I love the fact it is powered by the Firewire 800 connection. The only con is the very large blue eye (light) is extremely bright and constantly blinking during hard drive activity. It will take away about 1 hour of battery life, depending on usage, on your notebook via battery connection only. Great product for the price!"
5,An Engineering Marvel,"I use it with my MacBook Pro and Final Cut Pro to edit a broadcast that airs on the WB Network. It has been reliable, fast & convenient."
5,Great alt-country album from 1996,"""Country Love Songs""by Robbie Fulks(Bloodshot Records, 1996)------------------------------------------Great record; one of the touchstones for the alt-country/Americana movement of the 1990s. There are several hilarious, witty songs on here that don't pander to white trash stereotypes or whatnot, and some fine pickin' as well. Highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Hick Music)"
5,Wonderful,"Catherine Bowman has always been one of my favorite female poets. I can't believe this book is out of print. I'm lucky I bought one a while ago. If you can find a copy, buy it. She's one of the best around, and this book proves it."
5,Great book,This is one of the few books that I feel very comfortable with five stars. The poetry is beautiful. Many other books are ready to be donated after I finish them. This one will remain a permanent part of my library to be read over and over.
3,Very specialized book,This is dated material from the 1970s and 1980s and is likely to be of interest only to bankers active in those years. I enjoyed it because I was somewhat to very knowledgeable about the individual cases discussed.
3,A Good Place to Start,"This is an adequate survey of translations of material from ancient Egypt and a useful jumping-off point for interested readers. There is not much in the corpus of Egyptian writing remotely approaching the quality of the Greeks or Babylonians.The translations are pretty readable though a little awkward. The translators intentionally attempted to preserve something of the grammatical structure of the Egyptian, which strikes me as an odd choice. One does not translate into bad English, and whatever information is conveyed in mimicking Egyptian sentence structures will probably be of interest only to specialists who are unlikely to study this volume.Some genres gets short shrift (hymns, coffin texts, and funeral texts) and some translations are a bit off (like the willfully eclectic rendering of ""Dialog between a Man Weary of Life and his Soul""). More explanatory notes would also be useful."
2,Very disappointing,"I was immediately disappointed after I received this book and first browsed through it. The authors' idea of a ""project"" is buying some off the shelf gadget and plugging it into your PC. I don't need a book to explain THAT.Oh, and if you don't know what an MP3 file is, HERE ARE ALL THE DETAILS. What rubbish. Of the 14 ""projects"" maybe 3 or 4 are easier with this book, but the chances of you're being interested in one of those seems poor.If you get the chance to look this thing over before buying you'll quickly know if it's for you. If you have any experience interfacing PC's at all, just skip this book."
1,All of it can be found on the web for free,This is just a repackaging of info freely available on the web.
5,Lots of Fun,"I first heard about this book when the author was on the Computer America radio show, and he was discussing the build your own TiVo-type PVR project. This is something I have been thinking about for quite a while, so I got the book.Its actually full of projects like that - all very cool, and with do it yourself instructions for each one.Some of the projects dont seem to go as far as I would like, but they are great to get you going and provide some very solid foundation for your own modifications and tweaks.The writing style is easy to understand, and not at all over your head like some computer books.By the way, I discovered that this is actually a series of books that Extremetech.com is doing, and it sounds like they are doing more.All in all, I rate this 5 stars - mostly for the fun factor that makes this book, and these projects very interesting."
5,"Watchman Nee a man of God, an insperation to all",Watchman Nee from the time of his conversion to Jesus Christ laid his own life down at the cross. God our Lord used Watchman Nee in a powerful way to reach many in his own country and others around the world. Any person who desires to follow Christ would be wise to read this story of a man who submitted himself to the Lord and how God used him to change many lives. This was a very insperational book about true christian life.
5,A book even a local loves!,This guide goes straight to the heart of Atlanta dining. There's no fluff or obligatory listings - Jane Garvey knows the city and can sniff out those hidden jewels better than most travel writers. I live in Atlanta and love referring to the book for those eclectic finds I might have forgotten. An out-of-towner will be delighted to dine like a real Atlantan instead of a tourist!
4,Just what the title suggests...,"I cannot help but notice a little more closely or tip a little more generously each time I have the opportunity to come across folks working on or close to minimum wage - yes, they are everywhere - ever since I began to read this book. Yes, it will affect you and it is a good thing if it does. For it is the customer who demands 99 cent specials at fast food joints or the business which provides cut throat offerings which leads to such a dichotomy in our society today. Read this book and you will be a little more appreciative of your surroundings. But don't go about looking for the answers to the worries of life - that's something which Ms/ Ehrenreich did not set out to do... happy reading!... and consider reading Fast Food Nation as well - a scary but well written account of the evolution of the fast food industry (I read it two years ago and have not been able to go to a BK/McDonald's since...)"
3,"Good idea, less than perfect result","The author researches the life of the working poor by temporarily leaving her job as a writer and taking low paying, dead end jobs at various places in the U. S. Much of the book seems to be about her feelings about her loss of status and the indignities of blue collar work. She can't quite put herself in her coworker's shoes because she seems to perceive herself above them. A better book would have been letting the workers and their employers tell their stories and point of view."
2,Disgusting,"In a previous reveiw of this book it was written, ""Anyone who is curious about why poor people can't stop being poor should read this book.""Typical of the sort that should read this garbage and consider themselves ""enlightened"" as to the difficulties millions of Americans face.Buy the book, throw it onto the passenger seat of your Ford Expedition, and read it while waiting for Brittany or Blake to finish soccer practice."
1,Socialist propaganda at it's very best.,"This book is pure liberal propaganda. I was forced to buy this socialist pamplet by my like minded public university. Unless you are being forced to purchase this book by the University of North Carolina or some other educational institution avoid this book like the plague unless you are a dyed in the world socialist looking for justification to violate individual rights in the name of equality. However if you are a Republican, a Liberterian, or anyone who prefers personal freedom above the supposed good of society this book will leave you either stewing with rage or beating your head on your desk at every page."
5,A very eye-opening book!,"I absolutely loved this book!! I have a whole new respect for my waitresses and the house keepers at hotels and even walmart workers. I have a friend that works at walmart and she can totally relate to everything that Barbara talks about during her walmart experience. I strongly feel that this is a book that EVERYONE should read, especially those who have had the fortune not to work any of these jobs. It is one of those books that is just good for humanity, it lets you see the world from a whole new perspective!"
4,Engaging and well written,The myth that hard work will bring success is very ingrained in Americans. It is used to allay our guilt about widespread poverty in our country. That myth is challenged by Barbara Ehrenreich in this excellent read.
2,She had enough money to buy drugs,"Interesting topic and one that should be explored at a more substantive level. I've had my share of blue-collar, low-to-middle wage jobs, from high school until I finally received my college degree in my early thirties. The author chose to pay for her own apartment, rather than finding a roommate or renting a room. I knew plenty of working adults, myself included, who shared a house in order to keep expenses down. A low-wage job, in my opinion, is an entry level job. If one is still at that level well into adulthood, then there is an internal issue. What really bothers me about this book is that the author, in her mid-fifties, is a drug user. Did she already have drugs from her ""real"" life, or did she purchase them with her wages while working these low-wage jobs? Regardless, I suspect that she is a long time drug user and it's not a habit that she suddenly picked up as a result of her having to cope with poverty, albeit short lived."
3,ok,"I bought this for a sociology class. It is biased, a book based on a poorly executed experiment. However, sociology professors love it."
4,Eye opening literature,"I absolutely think that everyone should read this book. I was required to read it for school, but actually I think that I got much more out of it than expected. So many times people take what we have for granted. Ehrenreich, did a great job of helping her readers to open their eyes more and to not overlook the lower class of america, or those struggling to get by, but to appriciate them or lend a helping hand. It is a book that promotes national unity and appriciation. Nickel and Dimed is a great book and I highly recommend it."
4,Good book,"Nickel and Dimed is a good book. It really explains to you what the life of a working class person is. I'm 15, so at times, the book was a bit boring, but I know it was written for older people.One of the main strengths of the book was the writing style Barbara Enheric (I know that's the wrong name) is great at writing simply so you don't have to do that thinking type of reading. I hate that. So many Authors today try to write like their sooooooo eduacted, but forget that there are people reading it. No one wants to hurt their head while reading a book for leisure. This author really knows that.Also, I like how the author didn't only write about while being at work, but wrote about the life, the experiences that you have living on minimum wage, trying to find a cheap place to live. It's a good book, read it."
2,NO new New's,"This book was interesting, but not till the end of the book. The first part of the book was really hard for me to understand Barbara because she came off so arrogant. For me Nickel and Dimed wasn't new information, for me or anyone I know. My life was worse than what she was writing about because I had to pay my next months rent. I didn't have the option to just get up and decide it was time for me to move to the next town cause I was tired of dealing with the reality of life. Barbara on the other hand had that option and she had her back up money, that the working poor don't have. It wasn't till the end of the book that she didn't come off ssooo arrogant. Barbara had a really good idea about doing the study to see if she could live on the pay of a minimum wage job. I didn't really care for how she went about her study, but the book wasn't that bad I guess."
5,"The book is very funny, with a lot of heart.","What most reviewers haven't mentioned is that the book is often laugh-out-loud funny, especially when she works at WalMart. The author, an independent writer and academic, takes a fresh and bemused look infantalizing rules that employees of corporate America take for granted. Her stories reminded me of david Sedaris', because they're so real and affecting."
3,Too Sarcastic and Too Angry For Me,"After having read an excerpt of Nickle and Dimed in The Sun Magazine, my interest was piqued and thought I'd purchase a copy to see what I could learn from Ms. Ehrenreich's sobering experiment. I'm unfortunately disappointed. I admire Ms. Ehrenreich's guts in pulling this feat off. I am discouraged though by her hypocrisy, her belittlement of her colleagues, and her sarcastic and biting whining. Ms. Ehrenreich has enlightened me but her writing style is stifling and suffocating. This is the first time in my life I have felt anger and rage reading a book not so much because of what I was reading but more so because of the author's contempt towards her indiscriminate subjects of the working class."
1,"you said it, key west...","i usually disagree with babs's politics, but this ""expose"" is simply ridiculous. a diatribe for non-thinking people."
4,Fascinating,"Since the welfare cuts of the Clinton adminstration, there has been very little effort to explore the results of these drastic changes. This is a good start. well written, well documented, and engaging."
1,Poor: and this is why:,"I usually love books in this vein, but not this one. This author decides to take a break from writing to work at very crappy places. Sounds inticing, but when you read it- you don't discover ANYTHING. She does not reveal anything that is shocking, or give you anything that made you say; ""Wow, I didn't know that!"" At times this book was very boring. A page on what cleaning supplies she used and what surface they were applied. Through most of the book I was asking myself- ""Why am I reading this? I am not learning a damn thing!""Another thing that I thought was poor was how she had to tell about her religious beliefs, whih could have clearly been left out. If you are a Christian, you may be somehat offended at times. Overall, a very forgetable book."
4,Nickel and Dimed,"I flew through this book, loved every minute of reading it. If you ever wondered what it would be like to live off a minimum wage job, this is the book to read. Ehrenreich's style of writing was engaging and she really captures the drawbacks of what many of these low-paid workers feel and have to live through everday. I would highly reccommend this book."
4,A Must-Read,"Although some of the material could have been presented better, I highly recommend Barbara Ehrenreich's book. Sad, shocking, and at times completely unbelievable, the book clearly displays the truth about the low-wage working class in America that most would rather ignore."
4,*A Must Read for those Wanting to Change Things*,"Ehrenreich set out on a mission in this book and in my opinion she completed it. She desired to know what it was like to make it on minimum wage in the ""real"" world. Through hands on research she documented her 1 year episode of working job to job and being paid minimum wage in the state where she was at the time. Throughout the book Ehrenreich provides detailed observations of the working class and the corporate system displayed in certain organizations. This book is written for those in higher power to enlighten them as to the problems that the working class faces every day and to hopefully bring about change. I give this book 4 stars for its clarity in writing and its powerful message to spur on some sort of change."
3,Compelling in parts,"Nickel and Dimed paints a picture that tells a thousand words. Far removed from the everyday world of unemployment rates, minimum wages, poverty lines and other myriad statistics that serve only to numb us from the true meaning of poverty, Ehrenreich aims right for the jugular -- and succeeds.Infinitely more compelling than her own travails, which are disappointing shallow in nature, are the stories of her co-workers and their managers. These are the people behind the numbers. Real, breathing flesh. The people driving their beat-up dodges behind your SUV.Ehrenreich writes well and has a flair for using the more-than-occasional obscenity to jar the reader out of his comfort zone. It is refreshing that she does not try to attack or 'guilt' the reader, but rather just sticks to narration.Nickel and Dimed is a quick read, definitely not a deep, literate tome you will find yourself reading over again. Ehrenreich has a simple story to tell. And she tells it well."
3,Interesting but no detail,"I ordered this book for a project in a policy class in the Masters in Social Work curriculum. It was interesting, easy to read, humorous at times - all of which I enjoyed. The book is not heavy on details or statistics related to Welfare Reform or minimum wage. It did serve as a great backdrop for my presentation."
4,Interesting,"A friend of mine told me that I would probably enjoy this book, after saying that they did not like it at all. I was not sure why they automatically thought I would like it, but as soon as I began reading it I learned why. Although this book reinforces information that you may already know, it also brings the ""true-life"" story alive. This is not the most exciting book, but I found it be to interesting because of the way Barbara Ehrenreich was able to change her lifestyle, and slowy, change her mindset about the poor working class of America."
5,nickel and dimed,the book arrived well before the promised time . it was in fair condition as promised . the only thing wrong with it was someone got to it with a pink crayon.
5,Powerful and moving,"It's a quick read that will stay with you for a long time. For those who earn more than minimum wage, it is a call to political action to make this country a better, fairer place - or at least to remember that terribly hard work is not the key to success for many, many people."
4,required graduate school text,"Good price in used books, good prompt service. Interesting and thought provoking topic, quick read"
4,Informative,Definitely realistic in depicting the blue collar or vested working world. Since I've worked jobs like these before I wasn't shocked by too much. It just confirmed and put into more intelligent detail what I already knew...
4,Ari's Review,I really enjoyed the book. You really get a look into the low working class and the hardships that they go through. I personally recommend this book for everyone to read and I promise you that you'll like it. It is very powerful and will make you see the world in a different way.
4,Nickel and Dimed,"This book opened my eyes to how people really try to live! I look at workers in so called low paying jobs, quite differently. I see them."
4,A great book club read,My book club read this a few months ago and it really prompted a lot of great discussion. About half of the club thought Ms. Ehrenreich had a liberal agenda. The others believed the book was just trying to shed light on how hard it is to live on minimum wage. A thought provoking look at the working poor.
4,insightful,"I really enjoyed the book and I believe that the author gave alot of insight into the world of the underpaid working class that people so rarely take notice to. I didn't really like her style of writing, but nevertheless the book was eye opening and interesting."
3,subject audience,"Ehrenreich wrote ""Nickel and Dimed"" with the intent being that the middle and upper classes would read it, and therefore know something of what the lower classes were going through. It was not meant to be a biography of certain lower class people, delving into their private lives as well as their work lives. It was supposed to tell of only their ability (or lack thereof) to survive with ""poverty-level wages"". And while Ehrenreich's seemingly carefree style of writing may put some readers off, it seemed to almost mirror some of the poverty stricken characters' attitudes. They always seemed to be hopeful, or at least accepting.Also, while Ehrenreich's education is of the highest in rank, it didnt seem to do her a bit of good in her low-wage jobs.Although there are problems with her research (for instance, her quitting when the going got tough, her dermatologist at hand, etc), all in all, Ehrenreich did a good job of getting lower-class problems out and visible to the other classes."
4,I'm on the fence,"Having struggled for many years, this book didn't tell me anything any poor person didn't already know (except, perhaps, that maid services don't wash the pee out of the rags between houses- eeeewe!), however, it's nice that she wrote it and served it up for the people who don't understand the struggle.My biggest issue with the book is that the author seemed quite stuck-up and above it all, thinking that she was better than poor people. She walked away from jobs when she got too peeved- a *real* poor person has to just take all the crap that's dished out because they have to feed their kids.So maybe it's eye opening for some, but I found it offensive for her to say she lived it. She dabbled in it; she did not live it.Overall a positive review for the impact it's had on making people aware of the poverty struggle."
3,pretty informative and kinda interesting,"Although I am skeptical of Barbara's ability to find low-cost living solutions (I can find cheaper housing in San Francisco - one of the two most expensive rental markets in the country - than she was able to find in Minneapolis) I definately agree with the basic theme of her book: life is not affordable on minimum wage in this country. This book offers yet more evidence of the ever-growing gap between the rich and poor, and is especially relevant now during our jobless ""recovery."" But I didn't find the book to be particularly insightful; much of the data used is common knowledge - only the methods are truly original. Still, it is a worthwhile read, and if nothing else it should make you more compassionate when dealing with low-wage workers."
3,Not Exactly,"This is an interesting, but clearly left-of-center account of what it's like to be one of the ""working poor"" in the United States. Ehrenreich seems a little heavy-handed in her writing, and thereby loses much of her journalistic objectivity in the process. She suggests that she has the right answers to the problems she encounters, but many of her answers could surely be contested.I am a huge Bill Bryson fan, and I even enjoyed his ""A Walk in the Woods,"" but he didn't really walk the whole Appalachian Trail -- what a disappointment. ""Nickel and Dimed"" gave me the same kind of feeling -- Ehrenreich only ""sort of"" lived like those she writes about.Still, this book is worth a read -- even if it's not quite what it purports to be."
3,Response to Review by Scott Baier,"I chose to respond to a particular review by Scott Baier written on January 14, 2005. Praising Barbara's methods and skills, he neglects to mention the benefits that Ehrenreich began her journey with. While I agree that Ehrenreich should have set certain boundaries and limits for her story, I think that ruling out public transportation as her main mode was not the best idea. She also paid for her auto transportation with credit cards that she would not have had if she had actually been playing an accurate role. Many lower-class people rely solely on public transportation. Baier was so impressed with the book that he even went as far to state that ""the life of Barbara Ehrenreich will change yours forever"". I feel like this is a huge understatement and that while Ehrenreich's work is on the right track to revolutionary literature, many of her initial methods are flawed."
5,Give this book to family members who treat waitresses poorly,"If you enjoy non-fiction, (even in this ""reality"" imbued culture) this book is for you. Having worked in the food service industry, I identified with Barbara's undercover stint as a waitress. After finishing this book, I did find work that wasn't so gruelling ( which I was very grateful to find) Barbara gives an intellegent view behind the curtain of several types of low-wage servant-type jobs with wit and verve. It was a learning experience and an enjoyable read.How often do you get that?"
1,Left Wing Propaganda,"I read this for bookclub.What a disappointment and waste of time.This book is nothing more than the author expressing her bias, prejudice and progressive views. She is not grounded in reality. Sickening."
3,Ehrenreich fails to address the real underlying causes,"I have the book, and while it's informative, Ehrenreich fails to reveal why wages are so low.Globalization is a huge factor. Jobs are being outsourced to countries such as China and India.The feminist movement is a REALLY huge factor, hand in hand with the sexual revolution. These have contributed to more women (more people) in the job pool. Instead of having a family where Dad works and Mom takes care of the children, the parents are divorced, both parents have jobs--or the mother is unmarried and must work. Plus women buy into the lie that a woman is worthless unless she's out there actually making money.Illegal immigration depresses wages as well. My dad made over $20 an hour as a meatcutter--in the sixties. Now that same job pays less than $10 from what I'm hearing. We have illegal immigrants taking American jobs and Americans on welfare. Something is not right with that picture."
1,Great Concept. Awful Author,"The concept of this book is really good, but the way the author goes about it is all wrong. This book is not enlightening at all because the author focuses on herself instead of the people who really have to make do on minimum wage. The footnotes in this book are good and the only reason I would even give this book 1 star. How anyone could read this book and not get the vibe that the author is self important is beyond me. What a waste of a great opportunity on the author's part to really explore the lives of the individuals she came into contact with on her journey."
1,Would give this book negative stars if I could,"This book is so full of whining liberalism that it unnerves me to think that it would ever be considered for use in a classroom. The author criticizes everyone but herself. She berates her coworkers, her employers, companies, capitalism, those who have risen above poverty, and nearly everything else. I think she will be very happy in an increasingly socialist USA. She would only be pleased if everyone ( except her) were to be in the same depressed condition she puts the reader.Working in a free clinic I see many people who have been dealt a bad hand with health problems and unforseen tragedies and I have empathy for them. On the other hand, I see those who make terrible life choices yet do not recognize that as the cause of their misery. This author seems to see things in black and white, good and evil. This book and this author give the reader a real case of nausea."
2,Only A Beginning,"Working for $7.00 per hour or minimum wage was never meant to sustain a middle income lifestyle. Minimum wage is a start, but the most important thing to do is to obtain a formal education. If you are smart and poor and can prove yourself academically, you can get a scholarship. Take one step at a time and you will climb. We live in America -- don't ever think you have to settle for $7.00 per hour. The author exposes problems within our society, but there have been problems since the colonial era and will continue to be problems. As long as we are progressing as a country, the bar will be raised higher and higher for individual achievement. Americans should get off their laurels.Freedom is not free!!!"
1,dimed out,"I belong to a book club and we found this book quite unnerving. Nine women belong to the book club--some of whom are republicans, democrats, career women, homemakers, moms, etc. We were all in complete agreement in our hate for this book. One person even rated the book a ""0"" on the scale of 1 to 5. This book certainly got us fired up! We found the author very self-serving and at the same time very condescending. In our opinion, the author was snooty, judgmental, and definitely not politically correct! We thought the topic was of interest and would merit research but not in the way ""Barb"" conducted it!We just thought someone should ""dime out"" this author!"
1,An eye opener? May be for top 5%,"After extensive study and field investigation, Barbara Ehrenreich came to a conclusion that the lower 95% of the population have always known: Starting from scratch aint easy. The only people who might be enlightned by this book are other self-rightous, liberal, elitist brats who have never punched a time card or bothered to stop and talk to the ""underclass"".Reportedly, her next book will be entitled ""Fat and Ugly: (not) Getting Laid in America.""I can't wait to be enlightened."
1,"Oh please,","Talk about making a mountain out of a mole hill. The number of positive reviews for this book is really truly suprising. I'll spare you my rant. Buy it on the cheap if you must read..either that, or I'll GIVE you my copy."
4,Renewed Appreciation,"After reading this book, I have a new appreciation of the blessing of a stable address, food in the refrigerator, and the ability to close a door and enter a space that allows privacy without fear of interruption. Ms. Ehrenreich has made it impossible to ever walk into a mega-mart store again and see the employees as faceless servants or to dismiss them as under achievers. Although her political sentiments sometimes lead to some naive and biased conclusions, this is a work that changed my perceptions and for that I thank her."
2,Very disappointing,"I feel generous giving this book two stars, and I only do so because I think the underlying idea behind the book has some merit. Unfortunately, the author's attempt ultimately fails miserably because she brings all of her own baggage and biases into her reporting, which I think ultimately clouds her conclusions and results in a book full of whining and complaints. While there's no doubt that life for the working poor is difficult, I've worked quite a few low wage jobs and known many people who did also. I never saw anything close to the attitude of helplessness that the author pushes in this book."
1,Her evidence belies her conclusion,"Ms. Ehrenreich makes the very point she is trying to deny in this book. ""Low wage"" jobs actually serve an important purpose in society: they allow low-skilled people to earn a living. Without the fast food chains and discount store employers, these folks would be even worse off! At least with these ""back-breaking"" jobs, they have a chance to enter the job market, a chance to rent a trailer with running water, and a chance to improve their skills.As for ""affordable housing,"" nobody is ""entitled"" to own their own house. When you earn a low wage, renting a small place is what you do. Some of the ""characters"" in her book seemed to appreciate what they could afford, as opposed to Ms. Ehrenreich, a spoiled brat, who bemoans the small bathroom and long travelling distance from her trailer to her workplace.The book was a rant against successful people who make accomplishments in their lives. Mr. Ehrenreich seems to feel guilty for her own success as a journalist."
1,Lousy,"A lousy book by a snobbish, undignified, drug abusing author. I don't remember seeing a book written solely to put down the hard working class. What a phony."
1,A look from the bottom?????,"A look from the bottom?????I worked my way up from bagging groceries, washing floors and washing bottles. I worked in big box, and fast food and I escaped. I worked real hard, got educated and eventually got a good job. Each job helped me get the next job. That is the american story.I think the authour too an unrealistic approach to this, and this make the book useless. She is not doing the things she needs to do to escape.But what can you expect from a book that refers to Jesus Christ as a ""wine-guzzling vagrant and precocious socialist."" The authour is really uneducated if she belives this. Maybe her failures in life have more to do withe her attitude about the creator of the universe than our country.He attitude and lack of morals can when she identifies with the thief and becomes defensive of him. even though he was caught red-handed stealing from the storehouse. Honesty and integrity go a long way and those that lack them can be stuck at the bottom."
1,A waste of 10 dollars,"Barbara Ehrenreich's story of her experience of living as a minimum wage worker is an example of terrible writing/investigating. The intelligence she showed forth was small. She knew she had a limited supply of money but she didn't spend it well. She was biased in her views towards many people including blacks, Latinos and her coworkers. She constantly quit jobs and obviously wasn't able to become accustomed to the ""minimum wage lifestyle"". You don't have to life a terrible life if you are paid poorly, and you definitely can't live a life of luxury, but you can live fairly comfortably. It seems as though she did it all to simply sell a book and make money. Overall, Nickel and Dimed was a terrible and biased account of people that have to live their lives as a minimum wage worker."
3,Research has flaws,The concept of this book intrigued me so I bought this book. A couple of my friends support families with minimum wage jobs and I just don't know how they do it. I just thought the research seemed a little flawed because I didn't feel she stuck around long enough to get more information from her coworkers about how their lives really were.
4,Ehrenreich Does It Again,"Once again, Barbara Ehrenreich gets right down to the nitty gritty in her role as a social critic. She is as brilliant and witty as ever in documenting the travails of those among us who are constantly being vilified by the white guys in suits for ""burdening"" our less than idyllic society. This book should be required reading for those who insist on blaming the victims of our lopsided economy, rather than the system that victimizes them."
4,Met expectations,Ordered this bbok for my daughter's required summer reading. Received the book in great condition. The description given regarding the book and condition were spot on. Great service-fast turn around time.
3,cool,I got the book for a class. It came just like it said it should which like never happens. Its a good book not something I would pick to read but it has me going.
4,Barbara enlightens readers to the downfalls of low wage jobs,"Barbara does an excellent job portraying what minimum wage workers go through. She does this by telling the reader what her day to day life is like. To accurately do this, Barbara has to tell readers the physical hardships her body is going through. When doing this, she may seem like she is complaining. She is whining, although she is whining with the purpose of enlightening people to the hardships people face every day. I think that this book was interesting to read. Yet it does not have any startling information for people who are currently working the jobs that she worked. This book would be best suited for someone who is in Barbara's place in life. Someone well educated, who has not worked a minimum wage job for many years."
3,"Good, could have been better","I have read some of the other reviews here and some of the critiques are indeed fair, but I am going to praise the author as she is covering ground that very few others bother with. Yes, I expected more from the book and it should have been more in-depth, but the author at least made the attempt to find out what it was like to be a low wage worker. It is an important book for that reason and hopefully will inspire other authors to follow her example. For what it is worth, I currently supervise low wage workers and can tell you that many of them dont know how to get out of their situations and many feel that there is no other alternatives. I face a moral dilemna at times, as I want to tell them to unionize as the author suggested to her fellow workers at Wal-Mart. In fairness to the author, she seemed geniunely remorseful that she could not finacially hold out long enough to help them form a union. This is worthwhile reading."
2,"Good, but not great","This is essentially a modern remake of 'Down and Out in Paris and London'. I was quite interested in the subject, but the author always wrote in a detached me-vs-them tone that I found distracting. It was also frusterating how easily she gave up, or would not go to the depths that normal wage-earners have to go to... effectively limiting the scope of the book. It is, however, interesting enough to make it a worthwhile read overall..."
4,Nickel Dimed,"Firstly, Barbara Ehrenreich did not write this book keeping a lower-class audience in mind. Therefore, it does not attempt to expand the knowledge of poor people about the harsh reality of poverty, as it would be impossible to do so. Her target audience is the upper-class society that is so oblivious to the problems faced by people enduring a life of poverty.Secondly, the author does not walk away from the jobs to escape them. Rather, she attempts to go through various jobs so as to describe to the reader all the hardships associated with all the different jobs ranging from being a waitress to being a Wal-mart employee.Therefore, instead of criticizing Ehrenreich, I think her attempt to increase public awareness about the hardships endured by the lower-class, is truly commendable."
4,Nickel and Dimed,"M. Costello's review berates Ehrenreich for taking opportunities from the poor and exploiting them in a way that makes them look childish and helpless. I wholeheartedly disagree with these notions. First of all, Ehrenreich clearly did not aim to exploit the poor, which I feel is obviously stated in the book. Rather, her reasons for writing about this subject were actually to exploit the system that causes there to be such a group as the ""working poor."" Ehrenreich successfully illustrates that there are too many people working more than full time, yet are still not able to support themselves and their families. Secondly, Ehrenreich's research did, admittedly take a job from someone, but, I believe the benefits of her research far outweigh the fact that she took on several low-paying jobs for only a few months. Her book, a bestseller, exposed the conditions of the working poor to a large amount of people who may not otherwise be aware of this situation that affects so many Americans."
4,"The Real Life-""Undercover""","Barbara Ehrenreich does a fairly good job in this book of mapping out the problems that the lower class people go through everyday. I admire her for stepping out of her wealth to experience the other side, but she could have done a little better. Turning down all the help from the church and the government was not smart on her part and very unrealistic for the real lower class. She was lucky that she made it through. I felt close to the author in some ways while reading this because I know how it is in the real world but I am not undercover. It was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it to almost anyone who plans on being on their own."
4,A difficult subject,"Barbara Ehrenreich's ""Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America"" focused on her journey as an undercover minimum-wage earner in an effort to find out how people survived on a six to seven dollars an hour. From Key West to Maine to Minneapolis, Ehrenreich discovered that it was indeed hard to survive on minimum wage. The biggest challenge she found was that the cost of housing was just too unaffordable for people not earning a lot. She worked as a waitress in a diner, maid, nurse, and a sales clerk at Wal-Mart. Through her jobs, she was able to meet people who were struggling to make ends meet.This was an interesting book in sense that we have here, an upper-middle class journalist/author who ""learn"" about the lives of the minimum-wage earners. There were some valuable insights but there were also some condescending remarks that reflected her elitist point of view. There were definitely flaws in her study but her clear and concise writing made this book an easy read."
4,USA should increase the Minimum Wage...,"I regularly work in the USA, and when I mentioned this book to 10 or so US colleagues over dinner in Minneapolis last week, only 1 person had heard of it, which exemplifies the fact that the Middle Class America have little consciousness of the realities of the 'slaving classes'. This book does not go into a detailed damnation of the 'system' in the way that 'No Logo' does, but it offers well-written personal recollections of times spent in 3 locations, Florida, Maine & Minneapolis (hence why I asked my dinner companions if they'd heard of it). Even though I consider myself 'socially aware' it gave me further insight into the circumstances of those around me in hotels & restaurants, and reconfirmed my already low opinion of the inequalities in US society. I agree with other reviewers that it wasn't the greatest read, and lacked impact. I noticed that the US Minimum Wage is $5.15, and hasn't been changed for 5 years (ie since 1997)"
2,"A Good Read, but Not Enough","While I found the subject matter and the attempt at the ""investigative experiment"" quite interesting, I was disappointed that there was not enough of an effort to actually get into the lives of her coworkers. I would have preferred less statistical quotations about the working poor, and more of a personal account by more in-depth interviews and exploration of personal histories and life experiences. While an account of the author's attempts to provide a living for herself on her limited income was thought-provoking, it lacked the sense of realism that the description of her coworkers and other acquaintances along the way could have provided. I am not sorry that I read the book; I am just sorry that I didn't wait for the paperback version."
2,A Far Cry from Better Work,"Read ""Working"" by Studs Terkel.Barbara Ehrenreich's journalistic method is biased and flawed, her intentions are good but this subject is wasted on her talents and approach. Barbara's too-late realization of what it's like to work a minimum wage job is what fostered her spewing of a laundry list of complaints with little or no advice on how to alter the system she abhors. For someone who doesn't know how to do her homework, one would have expected Barbara to have worked more of these jobs before she was 18, and I know plenty of 18-year-olds who know how to yammer better."
3,Wolf In Sheep's Clothing,"Although the beginning of the book puts Ehrenreich on the correct path toward understanding the ways of the minimum wage life, by the end of the book she has completely martyred herself. Instead of attempting to relate her story, she condescends to her co-workers and leaves the reader with a better-than-thou feeling from the author. I was insulted, after watching and working with people living on these wages. I hope the upper class understands this after reading this book."
5,"excellent, what an eye opener!","This book should be required reading for all policy makers. The housing crisis in America is simple horrible. I have renewed respect for anyone in a service occupation, and a renewed passion to see change. I couldn't agree more that it is the affluent who are dependent on the working poor - not the other way around. I have become a more considerate customer and a more generous donor to food shelves as a result of reading this book. I only hope that this message can make its way to those with the power to change things. An excellent book, enjoyable to read and very enlightening!"
3,Editorial More Important Than Reporting,"The first third of the book was great, educating the reader about life as seen through the eyes of low-wage workers. Then the author lost her focus, told the reader less about her co-workers, and wandered off into a sarcastic, condescending editorial, with repeated rants about pubic hair. She had a great opportunity, and missed it."
1,Insult to my (and yours) intelligence,"A middle-class WASP that goes slumming and discovers that the getto inhabitants have a hard time. Very surprising.I'm an old ""white-trash made good"" boy, and this must be the most insulting book I ever read about being at the bottom parts of society. I mean, she doesn't even try to hide her extreme prejudices against the trash.Don't insult your intelligence by reading this (unless you're a WASP, of course)."
2,Talks About How Illegal Aliens Harm Working Americans,"An interesting books that exposes how illegal aliens take jobs from working Americans, drive housing costs through the roof and take away benefits from working Americans. The waitress does not get free health care and housing but the illegal alien does."
2,Self-serving garbage,"I read this book cover to cover before passing judgement on it, and I must say that it is not even worth picking up. Anyone who has worked a low wage job knows it is not easy to get along, but Ehrenreich seems to have written this book to make herself feel better about being wealthy, to gain some redemption for herself by experiencing what it is like to make a living on minimum wage. I carried this book with me throughout my business travels, and actually felt embarrased to be carrying it or leaving it in my hotel room. Pick another book. This one is a waste of time."
2,The author had an agenda and the book was totally biased,"BE is a woman with a very liberal political perspective and her bias was quite obvious when she did her ""research"". She wanted to see how the ""little person"" gets by in minimum wage jobs. It seemed that all the worker bees she encountered were hard working, big hearted individuals foisted into an unrewarding and unfulfilling life. All the ""bosses"" were brutish and loutish as well as bigoted and unfair. Her book could serve as the preamble for the Communist Manifesto. This book was neither valuable nor illuminating. Her husband by the works as a union organizer, need I say more."
2,Wading thru a sea of commas and punctuation...,"The story may be engaging but I couldn't tell. It was very difficult to wade thru the author's incessant use of commas along with a lot of other extraneous punctuation. I counted 5 colons on one page. I don't normally notice grammar, but then it isn't normally so annoying."
1,Author seemed a bit full of herself,I found the book quite insightful but I thought the author started to think too much of herself. But not a horrible book.
1,Crap!,This is the biggest waste of trees I have ever read. This book- if you can call it that is so hoity and condasending. I am discusted that it is required reading for a college class. I spent 10$ to read about a woman pretending to be poor???And the thing is...I haven't even made it past the first chapter.I love to read and I love books but I want to burn this one.
2,i might read it again...i guess,"the idea of the book is good, but barbara ehrenreich is probably the worst author ever. i would rather eat 56 bees infected with syphallis before buying another one of her books."
2,"Same Old, Same Old...","...tired rhetoric from the left. Worse, the author did only a very cursory effort at ""living the life."" I'd love to sell the book to get SOMETHING positive out of it but unfortunately I tossed it in a dumpster. That is where it belongs. Other than that, a great snoozer."
1,I could not stand the condescension and complaining.,"As you will read in many other reviews, the main goal of this experiment was not achieved. Instead of experiencing the world of minimum wage workers, the reader gets to read page after page of whining and condescending remarks. It was painful and provided zero worthwhile information."
3,Not as good as it could have been,"What I enjoyed most about this book was the author's quirky attitude and comments throughout the book. However, I thought that reading this book would give me a chance to see the world from a perspective other than my own, and offer me insight into the life of the barely-getting-by. A rare glimpse into another way of life that I wouldn't understand and maybe even have some shock value into what it's really like to live on low-income wages. But I was disappointed by the book because I feel as though I could have written it myself, just by guessing what it's like to live that way. I didn't learn a thing from reading the book, and I was hoping it would be insightful, it wasn't."
4,Food for thought,"This truly offers food for thought. Can you make it o. Minimum wage? After reading this I interviewed people doing the jobs that were written about, it was really eye opening."
4,nickel and dimed,"In my personal opinion Nickel and Dimed was a well-written book .The book is worth reading it especially for the ones who doesn't know how to handle money in life. The book gives some information about the way money is handled in life. After I finished reading the book, I just realized that nothing changed; I mean employers are still getting a low wage. It's not that I didn't like the book but I think we should put some of our thoughts in action. However, I definitely agree what Ehrenreich highlights in her book that on getting nothing in America, which is really hard to survive in life, if we do have a low wage jobs. I really enjoyed reading the book and Ehrenreich really did a good job on it because nobody who lives a life of luxury will challenge in a situation like this."
1,VERY BORING !!!!,This book is very sorry book I had to read for English class and as for the writter she doesn't even go all the way with her project by living off min-wage job. She has car and home to start off with fancy laptop if she really want to put herself in someone's shoes than she really should have. Who does this lady think she is judging others. When being a white lady makes easier to get a job in the first place.
2,Nickel & Dimed,"This was an enjoyable book to read. Simple and to the point. Barbara really got down into the trenches with America's low paid employees.She experienced their everyday routines and the headache of stretching their incomes, and gives some insight into the rules and personalities of their boss's attitudes."
3,okay,"i heard so many good things about this book, but in the end, i was a bit disappointed with it. yes, it gave me a glimpse into the world of the working poor, but i was already aware of how unfair it is. i think it is a good book for someone who has never had to work pay-check-to pay-check, so they can understand why people just don't ""change their situation if they don't like it"". i respect barbara ehrenerich for sharing her story and wish more people would be brave enough to conduct further experiments like this one."
2,190 pages of whining,"If whining turns you on then this is the book for you.It's too bad because there are some salient points here, particularly concerning the economics of trying to make ends meet on entry level wages. Unfortunately the author would rather complain about supervision, pre-employment screening and consumers who have the audacity to use products or services provided by low wage workers."
4,Is minimum wage really minimum?,This book reads like a novel. What is horrible is that it is not fiction. The characters are all too real and so are their problems and their attempt to get by on minimum wage.The author was quite brave. Of course it was easier for her to get by since she knew she could turn around at any moment. Which she did... but it was brave to go out there and try...
1,"Author repeatedly cannot believe that no cares when she ""reveals"" she has a PHD.","I really wanted to like this book, novel concept, should have paid off. Instead of a sociological experiment into the working poor lives, we get a whole book in which the pompous author repeatedly insults the ""yellow teeth"" and hopeless lives of people she works beside.Do not waste your time on this hateful book."
5,Pretty Good!,"Well my item took a while to be delivered, but it was a reasonable amount of time. The book is in great condition."
2,Could have been better!,"While reading Nickel and Dimed I found myself getting bored throughout many of the chapters. Ehrenreich seemed to get off of topic even though her book was supposed to be on low-wage jobs and the working poor in America. There were many times when Ehrenreich used racism, criticism, and an overall rudeness towards the people involved in her project. The footnotes were really good, but Ehrenreich should have focused all of her attention on her project. Though, her writing was very descriptive, she made herself seem very contradictive and very unpleasant at times. I do not believe that Ehrenreich was very informative when referring to the main topic of her book."
2,"Like ""The Simple Life,"" except serious","This book reminds me of ""The Simple Life,"" with a PhD-educated scholar who belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America and who was voted Humanist of the Year instead of a spoiled socialite. It's essentially the same thing. If you like hearing a spoiled brat griping about having to eat convenience store food instead of the homemade lentil soup that she's used to, or if you like hearing rants about people who don't tip, this is the book for you. If you're looking for intellectual insight, it's not.As an entertaining read that can be devoured in a couple of hours, I give this book 5 stars. As a sociopolitical statement and work of undercover journalism, which it's technically supposed to be, I give it one. Averaged together and rounded off, that gives us two stars."
3,????,"so i saw everyone knocking this book for it's ""whining"" approach to social righteousness. And how she didn't take the most menial jobs that were out there. After reading this book, my views on shopping and other cases has changed. After reading the section on Selling in Minnesota, i will never just discard an article of clothing whereever i feel fit. I will take it back to where i got it and neatly fold or hang it. The point was clear to me that no matter what kind of work a person is doing they should not have to do extra work do to human inconsiderance."
3,MAud Arnold Review,"I thought that this book was decent. However, she is patronizing the life of low wage workers. She has made a lot of money off of this book and the difficulties of the lower class. I respect her for her initiative to do this, however it was not a true expeience. It was very well written and captivating."
2,good idea - poorly written,"Our bookclub did not like this book. Her first 2 experiences are an eye opener and some of her remarks are funny. But by her third experience it becomes boring. Nobody understood the need for her to explain her drug problems, which did not add any value to the book.She each time jumps in a job for a month and questions her colleagues. How can you tell what it is really like when you just pretend for a monthI also felt her evaluation was adding more statistical numbers without giving a way forward. The conclusion of her book is that when you are poor life stinks and there is not much you can do to help it"
1,Good Idea - Poorly written and executed,"Great idea for a book. Poor execution and shabby insights by the author. The only insight is that cleaning services are not so clean. I guess this insight pays for the book, but otherwise a waste of time....and frustrating read.Try it yourself, but don't buy it..it's a waste of money.Donate the several dollars to charity...a much better investment in humanity."
2,Not Reality,"Like other reviewers, the author had resources to fall back on and she knew it was temporary and could quit at anytime. I was disappointed in this book mainly because I thought it would be more about stories of the people she met while working in minimum wage jobs. It was mostly about her and what she had to do to make ends meets, etc. I would have liked to read about REAL people who do this day in and day out with no end in sight. How do they manage to get up and do it all over again each day, knowing they'll never get ahead, never get a promotion, never make a decent living? I could never quite get into the author's shoes or feel any sympathy for her knowing she was playing a role and ""pretending"" to live like the other half. This is a good idea for a book, but needed to be written from the perspective of the low-wage workers...like interviews with them? How they perceive their jobs, how the future looks to them, how THEY manage to stay afloat?"
3,An all right book,"I purchased this book for a college course, and it started out okay. By the end of the first chapter I hated the journalist because I felt as though she wanted a pity party. The wages in this book was around 6-7/hr. in 2001. In my area the highest paying job is 8/hr now so I wasn't to impressed."
1,Dry and Boring,"No real insights here. This book seemed like such a good premise and that there was so much potential for insights and commentary on a social experiment, but I was left feeling like I wasted time reading it and was so disappointed it did not measure up. Here is all you need to know about this book- it is hard to be poor and being poor is hard. Physically demanding labor is hard and often not compensated with enough $$. Don't bother with this one, put your money to buying a sandwich and thank the person that made it for you with a smile and some kind words."
3,Good book but not realistic.,"This book is a good eye opener for people who have never been on the bottom. Read as a school book, my class and I worked our way through the book together. Ehrenreich provides an entertaining look into the world of lower class, minimum wage workers. Although, when reading the book one must keep in mind that through the entire time that Ehrenreich is ""undercover"" she also has an outlet available to escape if need be. Most individuals in this situation do not have this type of outlet. Ehrenreich is readily able to complain about her surroundings but what about those who have not known any different.I would recommend this book to anyone, but would give them a warning about these types of issues that Ehrenreich seems to skip over while on her adventures. It is a fantastic, well written book that everyone should read, with caution of course."
5,it is all so painfully true,"barbara e is to be championed for her daring to reveal the soft underbelly of the american economic prosperity. there will be a day of reckoning. the wages that the corporations are stealing from the people who do the real labor so that the bankers, lawyers and investors can make a profit will reap an interest that will be painful to enjoy. when inhuman corporations have more 'value' to the government than the people there is something terribly wrong. read this book. tell everyone you know about it...."
4,"Pretty good, but not in depth enough","An interesting look at the problems encountered by the working poor, but I would have preferred if the author had been more in depth about making ends meet on a minimum wage job. Thousands of us do it every day, and few of us have the resources the author had for _start up costs_. Try scrabbling for a place to live on $200 and a 16 year old car. I know, because I did it. And I am well educated and literate and a published writer, too. I would have been in heaven with the amount of money she had to start out on."
2,Good idea but disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book but was disappointed. While her idea was very interesting, I agree with many readers about her condescending attitude, both towards the poor and the wealthy. She made sure to always remind us that she was not one of ""them"". Halfway through the book it seemed her only agenda was to write an expose on Merry Maids and Wal Mart, and not about living on mimimum wage. Instead of being a book about how hard people struggle to successfully survive on low wages, she made it seem as if her co-workers were lost souls who had no direction or goals in life."
5,Great Holiday Book,"Being a sociology major at Michigan State University, one of my professors recommended that I read this book, and I absolutely loved it. Ehrenreich is an amazing writer, bringing humor to the not so humorous topic of minimum wage. She takes you to expericance first hand low income occupations such as waitressing in Florida, housecleaning in Maine, and working at Wal-mart in Minnesota. I quickly became attached to Ehrenreich and her quest to expose the back-breaking monotony of these low-class jobs. Through reading Nickle and Dimed, I realized how fortunate I am, and how affordable housing and minimum wage is a very real and serious problem in America today."
4,Read the Book/Donate your Tax Refund,"This is a well written and thought provoking book. My biggest gripe is that the author writes more about herself than the people who actually work at low wage jobs for real.Barbara Ehrenreich makes a particularly strong case for the difficulty of making ends meet in areas where housing costs don't begin to be affordable with a $7.00 an hour job. Read the book, and you may too feel compelled to donate your tax refund to agencies that serve those who do not earn a living wage."
1,Worthless Book,This book is a waste of everyones time. Especially of the students forced to read it in public school.
2,Elitest,"Although I give Ehrenreich credit for addressing an issue so often overlooked by most in this nation, I believe that Ehrenreich's approach was sincere, yet very elitest. Although she constantly brings up the fact that poverty is spreading across the U.S. population, it seems as though she's preaching to the choir, since most of us reading are part of that population of low-wage earners..."
2,Irritating book from over-class lady,"Big surprise,YES it is hard to work in the service sector in USA. This books is easy to read, but the author seems to have lived her previous life protected from reality. It is quite shocking that a grown well educated women seems surprised that she has little money left the day before pay-day, or that her back hurts when she has worked as a cleaning lady for ten hours.She is jealos of the people she work for, because they earn 2 dollars more an hour.In general this book is a boring tragedy of a women who really hates to work, and loves to complain. Get a life!"
2,I Paid A Quarter For This Book Used,"It is worth more like a nickel or a dime. Unless you enjoy dark-minded griping and the glorification of cursing a lot. This book could have been something great, but the author clearly believes she is way smarter than everyone else. The Dipper despises elitism and it is everywhere in this book and in those who insist I am too dumb or mean to not see it their way. Tough times can build character unless some pandering ivory tower type insists that that is too hard. Someone clearly has a god complex, but despises God. Sounds like daddy-issues to me...."
1,exploitation at its worst,This is a horrible book. She obviously knew what she wanted to say beforehand and did the 'research' because she had to. She goes into the situations with half a heart and is completely unwilling to see them through until the end. She is basically taking advantage of the situation of people struggling to survive in order to get a best seller based on her reputation and her publishing company's ability to advertise. Read The Working Poor instead. It gives a much better anaylsis of the situation and is built on years of research and relationships.
3,"Eh, it's so-so.","I thought the concept of this book would be very interesting. However, the Author's delivery, not so much. I would have liked more details about her co-workers, friendships and follow ups on where are they now or simply more of a personal insite to the people. She was very ""on the surface"" with alot of descriptions. The Author was a bit arrogant by constantly reminding us about her eduation and background. I hope once she published this book that she gave something back to the hard working people that ""helped"" in her research. Or at least gave them a (free) copy of the book! The Author ends with some very strong and thought provoking points. All in all it's an ok book if you're not into details."
3,"Not even close to ""Black Like Me.""","...Ehrenreich does deserve some recognition for what she did accomplish but this trial can by no stretch compare to ""Black Like Me"" where there were no escapes or refuges while living the life of a black man in the South. Griffen's life was constantly in danger and the human degradation was much more hurtful and complex.I do not admonish Ehrenreich for her mission but I do have a problem with her need to constantly remind the reader of her education and her ""fit"" body. Her callous remarks about the plus-size women...and people with bad teeth exhibit her need to feel superior by mocking others. These type of remarks lessen my respect for this author in an endeavor that should bring forth humbling admiration as well as respect.Ehrenreich does expose many important problems that low-wage earners have and for this I believe the book is worth it's weight as a paperback."
1,Waste of time,"This book was a waste of my time. The time she spent working on this book gave her BARELY a superficial knowledge of what it is like to live on or below minimum wage. She started out with a chunk of money to help her through hard times and constantly dipped into it yet acting like she had to work hard every hour to earn it all back. Sure, her back hurt a little and she may have been ""offended"" by drug tests, but it is not even remotely a taste of what it is like to work 2 jobs and not have a house to go home too. She wanted to go rescue her co-workers from low paying jobs, but she worked and spoke with the mindset of a well off White woman who is in these situations only temporarily. I doubt she came back to her real life and stopped hiring maids or even fought her change. Poor book, her experience was quite superficial and I am surprised so many people liked it."
4,A Very Interesting Look,"This book gave a very interesting look into the working class industry, especially waitressing, I always thought that was an ok field of work, the tips seemed good when I was at a restaurant. But I only had the customer point of view,not the workers point of view.I'm glad I read this book, it teahces you to appreciate the things you have in life.I recommend everyone to read this book."
5,Nickel and Dimed: A Great Book,"This book was a great read. I enjoyed reading about all of the different things that she had to do to just keep a roof over her head. Having a minimum wage job and that being your only source of income is something that is very hard to do. It is virtually impossible if you have someone else to support because you can barely support yourself. If someone had to do that here in Santa Monica it wouldn't be possible because rent nowadays is nearly $1,000 a month for most areas. Then adding your other bills you would probably not even be able to live on your own. Barbara Ehrenreich does a good job in this book conveying that so many people are treated unfairly and can't live comfortably and live check to check because of their minimum paycheck."
4,"Truth, or something quite close","How you react to the indignities heaped upon the real people in this book will let you know where you really stand on a wide variety of societal issues. The author doesn't just research her material, she lives it. She took the phrase, ""walk a mile in someone else's shoes"" literally. And what a tale she tells...Educate yourself. Read this book."
4,Putting Money Where The Mouth Is,This book was my first exposure to Ehrenreich. Little did I know of her activist past. However she does something few writers do....puts their holier then thou theries to the test. Well written and a great idea this is the book for all you who think all people are poor because they choose to be.
2,Worth the read but not your time,"I did in fact read this book in one sitting. And much to my ""surprise"" i found the author to be very snotty and felt that she fell VERY short of what she was trying to find out. In the beginning of the book I couldn't decide if I should keep reading or stop dead in my tracks. Nonetheless I continued with it. In some parts I questioned this woman's authority to be saying she had to eat and have housing to make it, I don't think anyone told her that she doesn't always have to have a table to dine at or food on it for that matter. And was she racist or was it just me? I tried to understand when she first started saying weird things, telling myself that ""she needs to do it so we could better understand the book"" but after two comments I wanted to throw-up on her. The only reason i would recommend this book to anyone is if they 1. were a housekeeper at anytime, which i was and found parts of this book funny. and 2. if you already hate wal*mart"
2,Just flip to the end...,"As entertaining as the book sounds and can be at times, I advise you for the sake of valued and limited time to flip to the end entitled, Evaluation. This last and smallest section of the book is in fact the point of the experience documented throughout."
2,Faux poor,"If you want to know how the working poor live, you could ask them. But why do that when a rich, white woman, who thinks spouting Marxist gibberish shows sophistication, tells of her attempt to live their lives? And if she cannot do it, you know that they cannot do it because she is so clearly more intelligent than they are."
5,Good investigative report,"The author proposes to live the life of a low-income earner for a few months to see whether she could survive under these conditions.She starts in Key West her hometown (I am surprised no one has recognized her), moves to Portland, Maine, and then Minneapolis. In each city, she barely survives on her minimum wages but has to live in rundown motels or trailer. On one occasion, she has to take on two jobs to make ends meet despite the fact she does not have any dependent.The low-income earner, she finds out, is a ""giver."" He/she endures privation, lives in substandard housing, and toils at low wages to keep inflation low and prices reasonable.Although the study is simplistic, the author is to be congratulated for her courage and sense of adventure for undertaking this project."
2,A good idea not well done,"I wanted to read the book from the time I saw the cover -- a good premise and a unique (these days) approach to the matter.The book is indeed a good quick read -- if you skip the preachy Evaluation part. The story that is told, though, belongs to the author and her adventures -- not that of the people she works with and for. The other folks in the story are not well-developed and come across as one-dimensional or as caricatures.If you're looking for insight into a way of life that you didn't have to bear by some good fortune, you'll have to go elsewhere."
2,could not finish this book,"I could not even finish this book even though it had potential. the author should of approached the subject in a Studs Terkel fashion with interviewing low wage earners instead of posing.Since when is the minimum wage supposed to be a ""living wage?"" minimum wage jobs are supposed to be stop gap jobs for high school and college students, immigrants. people in transition. i worked 2 low paying jobs nd put myself through trade school and have made over 6 figures a year for well over decade.Two things I learned about chronic low wage earners . One is that most of them have self esteem issues. Second, they will usually give you the shirt off their backs to help you. The nicest people I have ever met in life were strawberry pickers, farmworkers, maids, waitresses , etc.The name of the game is 'supply and demand' and always will be. It's not the big bad corporations as the author tries to make it seem.This book was a disappointment."
2,Half the Effort of an Investigative Journalist.,"I read this book a few years ago for one of my classes in college.The idea: a woman would give up all of the privilege and comforts of life to investigate the impoverished masses of America. Sounds brilliant, except the execution and dedication Ehrenreich puts into the book is sickeningly low.In the beginning, she sets rules to safeguard herself from actual injury or any dangerous situation, but it turns into an easy cop out whenever Ehrenreich was presented with a situation that was unappealing to her, yet these situations would have vastly improved the read for the audience and improved our gained knowledge from her experience. It may be that I have an unpopular opinion of investigative journalism, but I feel like if you're going to commit to something like this you have to commit with a Hunter S. Thompson level of dedication.Bottom-line: Fantastic idea, but poorly executed."
3,High Class Cop Out,"Barbara Ehrenreich's books starts with a wonderful premise, an attempt to understand how (and if) a person can live on and feed his/her family on minimum wage. She tells a good story but gets wrapped up in statistics and indignation, and ultimately, she knows that she can always go back to her upper crust life, and is a pretender to the throne of poverty and suffering. And in fact in her last stint as a working slob, she leaves the scene early, content in the fact that she may or may not have started a revolution in one Wal Mart in America. I don't buy her dedication to the cause, she always had a way out."
4,Excellent perspective,Not many people would have the courage to change for a while how they are living. Her experiences shows details that we take for granted and that we do not pay any attention.We think that jobs that uses brain are very stressfull but in reality all jobs can produce that level of stress. It is a eye opening book.
4,Mickle & dimed in America,"You have got to admire writer's sincere research. Book was timely for me in view of romney's recent comments re th 47 percent. As an individual who has lived in both a blue collar culture growing up and a upper middle class culture as an adult am acutely aware of differences and felt writer to be on target with recognition that while ambition, energy, committment and hard work blended with some natural intelligence count for much....where you are born..to whom and other ""accidents"" of life have a far greater influence on what you will Eventually achieve. A good read with an honest focus of economic facts affecting the working poor of america"
3,Long time,"It took about 3-4 weeks for this book to come in. It was a long long time, but it was in great condition!"
2,Ho-Hum. Ya-a-w-w-w-w-n....,"A decent writing talent, but unfortunately just another elite class-warfare socialist, using the same hyperbolic vituperation, false assumptions, and questionable statistics that so befoul Das Kapital.She hates the rich because they are (while she deducts $20,000 a year from her tax returns for mortgage interest!). She disdains the middle-class - and tries to hide her disdain of the poor - because they are just too, too banal, doncha know, and lack her intellectual pretensions. This book could have been so much more than just another left-wing piece for massive government intervention."
3,"Offensive, if not obviously degrading","Page 121: ""I had thought for months of going to Sacramento or somewhere else in California's Central Valley not far from Berkeley, where I'd spent the spring. But warnings about the heat and the allergies put my off, not to mention my worry that the Latinos might be hogging all the crap jobs and substandard housing for themselves, as they so often do."""
1,Where are the roommates?,No one can afford this type of rent solo on these kind of wages. I made this work with a 2 or 3 bedroom apartment and splitting up the expenses with roommates. The general premise behind this book is that people are entitled to live better than minimum wage will afford. I do not believe that people are entitled to any standard of living. People are certainly not entitled to a standard of living mandated or granted by the government and definitely not by taking the money earned by one person and giving to another person who earns less. People are only entitled to opportunity. There are millions of stories of people starting with nothing and achieving success in this country. There is no caste or group that you can be born to or join that will bar you from the highest rungs of success in America.
4,Nickel and Dimed,This book will reveal just how difficult it is to live under the poverty level in this country.
2,"A Good Book, but WAY too condescending","My family is not wealthy. In my life I have worked many of the same jobs that the author did (waitressing and wal-mart, to name a few). While I agree with the author's descriptions of the jobs themselves, and some of the conclusions she draws, I was mostly insulted by this book. I was not aware that I was so desperately ""poor"" and that I was such an object of pity, scorn, ridicule and amazement (as if the fact that I have a college degree, or actually read makes me something of a well-trained circus monkey). Basically, I was so insulted by the author's attitudes toward the people she was working with, that I had to force myself to finish the book."
4,"review for ""nickel and dimed""","i thought this was an excellent book and exposed many interesting things about the working class lifestyle that i was not aware of. while i agreed about most of what ehrenreich said about the inequality of those working minimum wage jobs, she was not realistic about some of the things she complained about. there are typical things within every occupation that one must complete that aren't always fun (i.e., drug tests, certain rules of conduct)and it seemed that she missed the point of that sometimes. i would have rather learned more about the lives of the other workers she worked with; it would have been more realistic."
4,"Good story, flawed conclusion","Pretty accurate description of everyday life for certain classes, but the final conclusion - impossible to survive - is clearly doomed. Most people in her situation would likely consider staying with family / friends or shared accommodations to save up certain amount of money, and one month on a job is not nearly enough to draw long term conclusions... But overall it is a pretty decent book, well written; and offers good portrait of a part of American life."
3,A closer Look,"I decided to read this book for my economics class. I thought Barbara Ehrenrich could have done better, but overall it was at least thought provoking. The whole book was about problems facing working class people in America, and though she adressed the problem she didnt give any kind of thought to what could be done about it. I also was dissapointed when she said she would never let herself go without food or a place to live, I think in putting these limitations on the experence she never truly got the feelings of fears that people without money might face. However even with these problems the book was well written and at least made me take a closer look at living and working in America."
5,Excellent book,If you have not read any Barbara Ehrenreich books this is a great start. She always knows exactly how to get down to 'brass tacks' when it comes to life in America. I have worn out two copies of this book already. Even though some of the information in the book may be a bit outdated (in 2013) the message is still the same. I use it as a reference often in political debates....all you need are the current unemployment figures. Should be required reading for every politician. Especially those who think they understand 'poverty' or the 'welfare system' or the working class in America. I highly recommend this book. It's a real eye-opener.
3,it's ok but not as observant as i hoped,"i got it for my wife. so liked it so i quickly read it.upper middle class tourist into the bottom wages jobs.ok. descriptive enough, she is a good writer. not nearly as much commentary on why people live like this nor why society and other people should care.this is a big problem, the book just barely is an introduction to the issues and little about how to help or care about the people stuck there."
1,Just Plain Bad,"This book was required summer reading before my freshman year at the University of Missouri. I was appalled to find after the first chapter or so a political undertone of liberals masquerading as journalists yet again.Now I am a middle of the road individual, but my biggest pet peeve is when people are NOT UPFRONT with there intentions. It was the most hypocritical book I have ever read.She does her best to point out how hard it is to get by on minimum wage with minimal education. She stays in these personas long enough to learn about her coworkers and show us how hopeless it is. Our lives are what we make of them not our jobs or money-I certainly hope I can not be reduced to a $ sign. Maybe if she lays off the drugs long enough she will stop blaming society for our problems and realize that it boils down to individual responsibility."
4,Great Book,"A real eye opener.I am the author of Domestic Abuse All Sides, Domestic Abuse Our Stories and Murder in New England & Closing the Circle."
5,A must read for anyone who has ever been interested in economic inequality,"This is a very interesting book, and is especially moving if you have ever worked in a low wage position. I have had jobs like those discussed in this book, and it is all very true. The book is taking a look at the people who are working low wage jobs as a living, not as a phase. When I say phase, I am referring to those of us that are still living with parents while we work through school, etc. The book is very telling of how society views its workers and it reminds us that we are all human, no matter what uniform we wear."
3,review,"Although many students either living with their parents or living with roommates take low-wage jobs to supplement their parents' income and to obtain spending money for themselves, there are many individuals who work low-wage jobs to sustain themselves and possibly their children. How many times have you had a waitress or maid that was obviously not a young college or high school student simply making money to be able to go to the mall later? There are clearly women and men who make, or at least try to make, a living by working at least one low-wage job. Some may feel that these people can move on at any time they want, but the truth of the matter is if they could obtain a better job and live more comfortably, they would. Although Ehrenreich is obviously not one of these people, she still gives a more enlightened perspective to what a low-wage worker must do to survive, whether it be living out of their cars or motels or working two jobs to the point of exhaustion just to get by."
3,A fun read,"While anyone could be angered by the political positions that Barbard Ehrenreich takes in this book, I don't think I've ever been more amused. She knows how to state her facts to keep her writing entertaining, yet, she pulls no punches. This is one of the funniest writings of working in the minimum wage world that I have ever read. From her time as a waitress, a Wal-Mart employee, and a maid. The most amusing part of this book that I will always remember was her writing about her position as a maid, cleaning a wealthy Buddhist's house, and then stating that the man pays thousands of dollars on retreats where he has to scrub toilets.I loved this book, and it was one of the most enjoyable reads from the social commentary genre. I wish every writer could present information as Barbara Ehrenreich did in this book."
2,Nickel and Dimed?,"This book will give you a look at a couple different aspects of low wage workers. In Barbara Ehrenreich's study, she works many different jobs in many different regions throughout the United States to show how low wage workers get treated in todays world. Throughout her experiences she documents all of her own and her fellow workers experiences.On the other hand, if you can manage listening to her complain about working this hard low income jobs, you learn that she only works for month at a time and hear her talk about how bad she is living. I believe you will really enjoy this book."
3,Book Review,Barbara Ehrenreich does a well done job writing this book. She shows how living on minimum wages will get you nowhere. Barbara talks about how getting two jobs is the only way to live indoors. She finds out that these low wage occupations require hard work and discipline.
1,What a load of bull,"I can't believe I read through the entire book. the only consolation was that I filled the sidebars with angry comments. the whole tone of this book was bitter and angry. SHE was angry to be poor not her workmates. THEY were rather happy with life and full of hope looking towards a better future. Those of you who read it and bought into it, I advise you to read it again. pay attention to the tone of the book. Observe who the author is, and what her outlook in life is like. then, imagine youself in the situation of these people she writes about. than think to yourself if you would be as angry as she is. I am sure you wouldn't if you are well adjusted.The whole book was a sream of ranting and raving: I just love the way she compares a husband to a dog at one point, and the way she talks about pubic hair in the shower. a real OPTIMIST I gotta say."
4,I've become a better tipper since reading this,"This book really opened my eyes to the discouraging reality of the lives that so many of our service workers live. Even finding time to read for pleasure is a luxury that I now realize so few low-wage workers enjoy.I realize now what a lousy tipper I've been, and I've resolved to do much, much better."
2,preordained conclusions,"Perhaps this writer has never worked (thankfully her father did). She should not have bothered to waste her time experiencing the work force. Her conconclusions were all preordained although she claimed she was investigating her hypothesis. I'm sure she's planning to give the fortune she makes on this book to those unfortunates she has written about.(Perhaps George, the Czech she failed to defend on charges of stealing)."
2,I lived it.,"Babs worked at a few low wage jobs but she did so as a tourist. I worked as a janitor and a factory worker for years. I dont feel that she really knows anything. I would suggest instead Ben Hampers book Rivethead. I give her credit for looking into the subject, but come on. She is just another Harpers denizen who doesnt' know bupkis about the world if she cant write some nifty article about it. There is alot more to say about blue-collar America than Babara wants to fit in here cute little articles. Too bad. Try Ben Cheevers book. Hes' significantly less flippant, believe it or not. Thanks for nothing Babs."
1,I hate this book.,I had to get this book and read it for Comp 1 class but it is awful.The author basically complains the whole time through the book while she is trying to live as a low income person but she cheats constantly and still complains about it. Also she is rude and judgmental. I was just not impressed and 90% of my classmates also hated this book.
3,not horrible,"this book wasn't horrible, but i found it repetitive. The author seemed to be saying the same thing over and over. Got this book for highschool because it was a summer reading book we were suppose to read. I haven't finished it yet. Tho much of it is little repetative i did find it interesting."
2,Please forgive her...,Ehrenreich mocks the underprivileged with her unrealistic perspective. The two stars go to the last chapter.
2,one long article,Nickel and Dimed is about the author's experience of being a poor white women trying to pass off as a part of the working class. The book hits on several good points but she could have gotten the same information in an interview. A better book on the poor and not getting by is The Working Poor: Invisible in America.
2,Unrealistic.,"Even though I liked the concept of the book, I feel that there were many additional types of entry level jobs that she didn't consider.I worked in a warehouse distribution center for 6 years. People hired off of the street with no experience or even a mastery of the English language were paid $12.50 an hour to start. (And that was 3 years ago!)She also never attempted to use a temp agency - something that totally perplexed me."
5,An amazing read,"The entire time I spent reading the book I was both amazed and hooked.The writing is funny as well as informative and critical.Undoubtedly this is s book everyone needs to read,as it highlights the real working and living conditions of the low income workers."
3,Interesting Social Experiment,"It was an interesting social experiment and at times eye-opening. But, I wish Barbara made use of public transportation -- which she seemed to shrug off. Automobiles are very expensive, and taking the bus could have allowed her to spend...extra [money] on rent (thus helping her with her housing problems -- especially in Minneapolis). Also, expensive habits like smoking ...do not help a low-income person either -- not to mention increasing the likelyhood for healthcare issues.Overall I liked it. I admire her courage to undertake this experiment and report back."
5,Outstanding!!!,"I hated to put this book down.I can't say, enough, how much I enjoyed this. This book will give you a entirely new prospective on our economy and our working poor.It will make you think, twice, before passing judgment on a cleaning lady or a waitress or a department store clerk...if that's the type of person you are.I think everyone should read this and then go back and read it, again.Bravo!!!"
3,"HELLO, HELLO, HELLO?????","I read the first ten pages of this book online and I couldn't believe Ms. Ehrenreich made such a big deal of having to take a urine test.. that really shows how out of touch with reality she is. When was the last time she worked a 9-to-5 job before she wrote this book???? Does she even have regular middle class friends who work 40-hour weeks?? I paid 36% of my income in tax this year and I had to take a urine test to earn that privilege, both on my current job and my previous job. People in her social-economic level tend to see others through tainted glasses. I give it three stars because I have not read the entire book."
4,nickel and dimed,This book gives an insight to how the economically challenged live and it sheds light on what they go through to survive. It also sheds light just how wrong the government is when they make the salary brackets that determine who gets aid and who doesn't.
3,A Nobel Effort,"How do people get by on minimum wage? They sure don't shop here!Barbara Ehrenreich's book does document a total submersion study of her explorations into poverty. For even trying she should be commended. Still this is an insulated point of view for an insulated audience. Want to know what it's like to be poor? Read this book and dream on.At best this book documents the bad choices women in poverty can take, like working for Wal-Mart instead of risking venturing into the non-traditional hardware plumbing department at higher wages. It's like her idea of poverty meals was fast food. (She admits the idea was formulated over a $30 dinner.) At best it simulates the leading edge of a fall from grace. The initial start of the learning curve.Her conclusion? Unions for all. Okay, maybe so. She didn't have to stick around to follow through and those that would benefit aren't reading this book."
1,Author short on real experience,"I truly thought this would be a thoughtful and thorough evaluation of how people try and live on minimum wage jobs. Instead it is a long rant by an obviously overprivileged writer who is offended that people actually take jobs cleaning other people's toilets. Rather than tell us HOW she gets by one low wages, she rages about the indignity of the jobs. Every day in America people go to work and bend over to load a dishwasher. For most, it's a job, not a an oppression by an Aristocratic government. The only social study going on here is how far removed someone well-educated and well-fed can be from working class society. Skip this book and read something by Studs Terkel."
3,Condescending much?,"I'm glad this book was written and has been so widely read. People need to know this stuff. However, I didn't find it an enjoyable read, and not because of the depressing subject matter. Ehrenreich's attitude bugged me. The moment that disgusted me most? When she mentions casually how she allowed herself a handful of tapes, then lists the artists - just so we all admire her musical tastes. I bet if she listened to Celine Dion and Hanson, she wouldn't feel it was germane."
5,"Very Engaging; Req'd reading for all who live ""comfortably""","I needed to read this book. I'm at a place in my life now where I'm living ""comforatably"", but it wasn't always like this for me. Ehrenreich took me back to what it was like living (barely) pay check to pay check without healthcare. And, it can be that way again for me, for anyone. This book calls us all to work for social justice and demand healthcare reform. Life is HARD, but it's even harder when you're trying to make a living earning the minimum wage. F' feeling sympathy or pity for the Walmart workers--stop shopping at Walmart! Stop helping the rich profit off of others' pain and suffering. Read this book, get mad, do something."
5,STAYS with you forever!,"I read this book 3 years ago, and I'm STILL experiencing recall and flashbacks to some of its passages. For example: I might be doing nothing much in particular, as I set myself down to dinner at a family style restaurant...and WHAP!!! I will recall a passage from ""Nickled and Dimed"" concerning the not very pretty or easy plight of many waitresses and cooks who work at such establishments. And ""Nickled and Dimed"" does it all with a sense of humour, to boot!Very thought provoking and enlightening for anyone who wants a better understanding of the working poor and the flaws in our socio-economic system.""Nickled and Dimed"" should be required reading for every politician and social worker in the United States."
2,We get it! You have a Ph.D.!,"My book club selected this, I doubt I would have selected it on my own. At first, I found the author's sarcasm entertaining. Eventually it just got on my nerves. Did she have to keep reminding us that she was a writer with an advanced degree? I enjoyed some portions of this book but I cannot give it more than a 2 star rating."
3,Try to get past the hyper-liberal point of view.....,"I found this book to be an extremely interesting study of those who work in the service sector. Having been a food server myself, I thought the observations about the perception of management were quite accurate. I grinned to myself multiple times while reading, recognizing my own thoughts about managers.However, the obviously liberal bent of Ehrenreich's writing was hard to read at times. She seems condescending toward those who work these jobs and yet don't resent those of a higher social class. Overall, I thought the book was well written and well thought out."
5,Just what I expected,"Barbara Ehrenreich took on several working class jobs to see how she would fare if she had no money, husband and no relatives to go to for help. She also made her fictional background pretty bleak with regards to work background and education.Just as I suspected it is nearly impossible to live any sort of life that most of us take for granted. A lot of it was pretty depressing when you think about the real people that live like that every day. Forget having any fun and be prepared to run yourself ragged if you find yourself in their shoes. It's no wonder so many people turn to drugs in that situation. It might be all you could look forward to.Despite being depressing, it was absolutely facinating. Go ahead and take a ride on the other side and be sure to thank God that you're not in their shoes when you're done."
1,A disappointment.,"A noble idea, deeply flawed in implementation. Ehrenreich's analysis is superficial and her tone whiny. By the end of the book, you know a lot more about the author than about the challenges facing low-wage workers--and what you know is not particularly flattering. With a great deal of editing, this material might have made a good magazine article, but there's just not enough reporting or research for a book."
2,Privileged author finds life is hard when living paycheck-to-paycheck,"Sorry Ms. Ehrenreich, but your chronicle of suffering through the experiment of the blue collar lifestyle left me less than sympathetic. I have lived in the low-rent, high-crime areas. I have driven the beater bombs. I have forfeited conveniences like fresh produce, telephone service, and shoes that didn't tear up my feet. I have lived through pay periods where I had less than five dollars left after all of the bills were paid. Welcome to earth. Sorry you didn't like it."
2,Possibly there was a better way...,"All in all I belive that this book has brought light to the plight of the working poor. However, I do believe that this story could be told better by someone who has actually lived the life of a minimum wage worker. If the author had spent less time with her personal conversations and complaints of the working conditions she might have made this a more effective tool for people to use to help change the lives of many Americans."
2,Awful,"As a card-carrying liberal, I am very concerned about the pervasiveness of poverty in the U.S. and was eager to read this book. However, Ehrenreich's sanctimonious, condescending, self-satisfied writing does a disservice to the issue. Her tone was so self-righteous and smug that after 5-6 chapters I put down the book in disgust. Save your money. Borrow the book from the library if you feel that you really must attempt to read it and then brace yourself."
4,An interesting perspective,"I felt that the author's message was very important, and make this book worth reading, but her somewhat cynical and sarcastic writing style does get a little wearisome (not to mention her attacks on religion). Ehrenreich does do an adequate job of explaining that she didn't really know what is was like to live in poverty... and this actually strengthens her argument. She had it better in many respects than her coworkers, but still struggled to get by. A worthwhile read."
1,Life [disappoints] - The world according to Ehrenreich,"It is amazing to me that a person would spout such nonsense. As a person who has worked many low paying jobs, I can say with authority that the author's portrayal of life is dead wrong. We don't sit around and whine, we try to better ourselves and succeed."
5,Personal research and stories as social commentary,"Ms. Ehrenreich has done what many people would fear to do--she participated in her own social research. She wanted to find out how people manage to get by (or don't) in low-wage jobs in the United States. To do this, she spent several months finding and working low wage jobs while living on the budgets those jobs allowed.The story of her experiences in three different cities is very well told, approachable, and (in my view) without significant recrimination at ""corporate greed"" or ""social injustice"" in the politically correct, abstract sense. Where she offers critique, it is from personal experience and in specific examples.I live in one of the cities Ms. Ehrenreich tried to get by in. While I realized the difficulty that the shortage of affordable housing in my area causes, this book gave my a much better picture of what a ""housing shortage"" really means to people trying to live in low wage jobs.I strongly recommend this book."
1,leftist rant,"This was a really great premise, but was scattered, shallow and turned quickly into a naive rant. This woman is out of touch with reality. It is a shame, as a true adventurer could do this and come out with a gem. She is an academic snob, who can't write in logical sequence, and should stick to her biology. Even her co-workers were not impressed! A bore, from a well intentioned but a clearly 'out of her depth' writer. Save your change, folks, and spend your silver elsewhere."
5,great book condition,"Even though I ordered a new book it was in awesome condition. Shippped right on time, it even arrived a little earlier than I expected.The book's condition, as I said, was great no scratches or folded ripped pages. Excellent."
2,An interesting idea that gets mired in leftist demagoguery,"The premise of this book is interesting and the author is reasonably successful at portraying the plight of the working poor. Unfortunately, the book degenerates into a lengthy and disingenuous leftist diatribe. This book would be much more persuasive if told from a more objective point of view."
2,A simple Comment,"I think that Mrs. Ehrenreich has very little appreciation for the fact that our country's poor have as good a lifestyle as they do. I'm not saying it's easy to work a minimum-wage job and support a family, but perhaps the author could benefit from a comparison with a number of third world countries where the poor are not only literally starving, but also comprise a much larger percentage of the total population. No society has it perfect, but the United States is doing a DARN good job of providing a high standard of living for its citizens while also forwarding the previously unprecedented idea that anyone has the freedom and the capability to take it upon themselves to better their situation.In short, ""Nickel and Dimed"" was fine as a personal story, but it fails as social commentary. It would have greatly benefitted from a bit more perspective and a bit less agenda."
1,Self-Centered,"This book was not about how to make it by in America on an average wage, it was about how much the writer could inflate her ego. All the writer did was talk about herself and give social commentary (misguided at that). She goes into excrutiating detail about what she eats, what she packs, etc. Actually, in my viewpoint, Ms. Ehrenreich is making money on the backs of the poor with this book, exactly what she is disgusted about in the corporate world. I do not recommend this book unless you want to read a book that will completely agitate you."
2,Seems Like a Pointless Exercise,"Maybe the author was well intentioned, but Nickel and Dimed was a real disappointment. I did not understand why she chose to live on the financial edge, unless it was, of course, just to get material for a book. She showed little compassion for the people she worked with and was never one of them. A certain smugness about her education and fall-back funds was always there. It was more stories about abused wives,abusive husbands, abused employees,surviving with no education,living in awful conditions with drugs and alcoholin the background. I think most Americans who can read know these things. If the book had had a point it might have been how the plight of the poor can be helped with education, stronger families, programs that help the poor help themselves. The book was a downer with no answers and no hope. The only positive thing I can imagine coming out of it is profit for the author."
2,lacking class,"I was quite disappointed in it -- I guess I bought into all the ""hype"" that I had heard about it. I appreciated how informative it was and it confirmed what I already knew. The author's sarcasm at times was offense as well as how she talked down towards others not like her -- not very classy in my opinion."
1,"No ""Grapes of Wrath"" Here","As a dedicated populist, I was looking forward to reading this book. I teach high school history and assign the Grapes of Wrath to all my AP US History students. I was looking for a book for the students to read to demonstrate how the poor live today.Instead, what I found was a book about Barbara Ehrenreich and her jobs. It was not about the people who hold those jobs. I do not want to know why she refused to hire a maid when she could afford one, I want to know why someone takes a job as a maid and how they live on those wages.It helped me truly appreciate the stark brilliance of Steinbeck and his ability to portray the reality of poor American people. It also demonstrates the distressing inability of the popular liberal media to understand or describe the reality of life for poor Americans.I agree with another reviewer -- read Studs Terkel. I would also would welcome other recommendations for short reading that I could assign to my class."
3,She Often Missed the Point,"While her little social experiment was interesting and enlightening, she spent much too much time indicting people and situations that were beside the point. For example, she criticized Minnesotans for being fat, the rich for having dirty toilets needing cleaning and Wal-Mart for actually wanting to keep its stores organized. Her footnote quoting experts about how to clean counters and floors juxtaposed against the guidelines dished out by the Maids would be more apropos in a book about the cleaning industry in America!"
4,Interesting and insightful!,"I found this book very interesting both in its topic and its approach. I now find myself more aware of employees and grateful for their help in the stores and establishments I go to that are similar to those depicted in the book.Unlike some readers, I didn't take the book from a political standpoint, but rather from a human one. Nor did I choose to question the authenticity of her experiment.This book simply made me more grateful for things I tend to take for granted and after I closed it, I found myself counting my blessings..."
4,Kool,"Kool rhythms: play it LOUD if you can afford speakers. Missing something, though.... like something other than pinpoint focus. Commercial possibilities as background music for a speed (or B-2 bomber) commercial."
1,dice,"This was a disappointing transaction. It did not turn out to be what it was represented to be. I was not happy with the seller's response, but it wasn't worth a fight."
3,book review,"I ordered this guide to use for planning a training in my job. The book was in good condition, arrived on time, and has been very helpful."
1,Do Not Buy,"I bought a 4 pack at OfficeMax because it looked nice, it comes with a replacements for the lead AND the eraser top. But I really regret it. The lead keeps breaking (while in the tube) so when I press to put more lead out, it comes out a little bit and then when I write, it pushes it back in so I keep pressing it until it falls out and I repeat. It's pathetic. I'm actually writing this right now after I got frustrated while writing some homework and the lead broke once again. I'm sure there are cheaper brands with more reliability than this."
1,Absolutely terrible,"-Shoddy construction-Poor mechanism-Breaks the lead within a few clicks-Exhausts the reservoir within minutes of (attempted) useI really regretted this buy, and I'm glad this item isn't available any longer."
5,effective treatment for hand eczema,"I have periodic flareups of severe hand eczema and have tried every lotion made (ok, not every one made, but ALOT of them, including steriod pescriptions) trying to calm the itching cracking and blistering. I used this product like lotion, applying it every couple of hours for about a week and brought a two month flare up under control. Give it a try. FYI, the lotion version on it's own was not effective."
4,Good Power Window Motor & Regulator Replacement,"This product was very close to the OEM product. However, the 3 positioning nut holes were replaced by 3 bolt stubs. I had to run down to Home Depo to get three 6mm nuts in order to complete the installation. There was no clear instruction just like most of the auto parts. However, I could get some help thru internet. The rest was on my own. The whole installation process took about an hour. That did not include the time to figure out what to do and how to do when I saw the part did not fully match the original. The time to Home Depo was not included neither."
2,Better items for your money,"I've owned this interface for about a year and a half. After about three months of moderate use it started acting up on me (such as disconnecting). These things continued to get worse with more time and after about it year it stopped working altogether. I will give it that the sound quality was fair and Cubase LE isn't a bad 'out of the box' recording program. Furthermore, the preamps leave something to be desired. I was able to get a few decent sounding recordings out of it while it lasted, but I could have spent my money much more effectively on another product. I would recommend something by PreSonus or M-Audio."
3,Works when it wants to.,"It works great when it wants to. From day one, IT will decide whether or not IT wants to actually finish a song without disconnecting from the computer via the USB cable. Apparently, the connection in the interface is loose (on the inside of the box) and tell the computer ""Well, I'm done, now you can use your own internal mic"". This is really frustrating when my 10 year old is just about to finish Master of Puppets on the drums and it decides to shut off the external mic and go to the mic on the computer."
2,Mac users beware!,"Horrible support for the MAC, despite claims that it is compatible with 10.4 and above. The software reverb is VST not AU and will not install in 10.5. There is nowhere on the companies support page that even mentions the Mac version. All of the controls are on the hardware including routing and volume as well as live input mix. Routing is problematical and is made very unclear when in apps using the interface. Logic had no problems getting signal, but Guitar Rig 2 and 3 couldn't get signal no matter what I did (if I cant get it to work, I'm returning the unit.) Sound quality is adequate and I were only using Logic I would have scored it at 3 or 4."
2,Cheap Quality -WTF Lexicon???,"PROS- Low Price. Decent Mic preamps and converters. Pantheon Reverb is high quality. Good signal routing features.CONS- Cheap plastic casing. Limited applications - the Pantheon plug-in sounds good, but will ONLY WORK in the version of Cubase LE they ship - which is buggy. Big Letdown.Also, the USB installer is buggy. From time to time I get a ""Found New Hardware' message and things stop working until I reboot to a previous configuration. HASSLE (sigh).You get what you pay for. I only purchased this because at the time the EMU1820m was out of stock.I've also got an Echo Layla interface (paid $700 new) from 1998 that still runs GREAT under WinXP, worth every penny.Now if the Layla from 1998 will run flawlessly on XP, and one released last year will not, it's obvious that the Lex was rushed into production, COMPROMISED all the way.The Lexicon Omega is rubbish."
2,"great idea, didn't work","I had problems getting this to work. After several attempts with the manufacturer, I gave up and sent it back. The tech was very helpful, but nothing I tried would resolve the problem."
1,"Would be OK, if it worked properly","Simply put, this item is not reliable. Do not expect it to capture that perfect 100th take of your next single when you finally get it after weeks and weeks of takes. This thing will happily glitch out, distory the audio, not record, or otherwise horribly botch even the simplest of recording tasks. I replaced this unit with a MOTU ultralite and am now much happier. The MOTU is somewhat smaller, but MUCH heavier, as it is constructed of metal. (The Omega seems to be made mostly of cheap injection molded plastic)I never could get this to work properly with my studio monitors or headphones either. I bought this for a mobile setup, and have no such problems with the Digidesign 003 mixer/interface I use at home, or the MOTU ultralite I ultimately purchased to replace this flakey incident-prone product.Do yourself a favor, you're better off with your computer's built in sound card than this device. At least the built in one works."
1,Worked for a few months,"I've owned the Lexicon Omega for 2 years. It worked for a few months, then began behaving very erratically. It will connect/disconnect from the computer constantly, and even caused my computer to get the 'blue screen of death.' (My computer has never been the same and I am having to replace it now.) I returned it to the manufacturer while it was still under warranty. However, it still did not work when they returned it to me. Now it is out of warranty. It definitely has defective craftsmanship. I have heard some good reviews for this product, so if you get a good one, then you are in luck. However I'm not willing to take that chance again. I definitely do NOT recommend this product to anyone."
2,Very poor reliability and quality,I've given this product a chance as an owner for over a year now but the quality is just terrible. After purchasing the Lexicon Omega the device would disconnect about 5 times a day and I would have no sound until I unplugged and replugged the USB/power in a specific order. Lexicon was very helpful and replaced the mainboard in a timely manner.Since then the sound quality has been slowly deteriorating to the point where I now have a constant hiss that continues to get louder. When I turn the level knob I get extremely loud hissing and popping around the 25% mark. Sometimes the levels between the two speakers don't match and I have to make minor adjustments to the level knob until they match back up.I've decided to ditch the Lexicon for a more reputable product.
1,I've finally given up...,"I have worked with this unit for far too long with too many computers. I have finally given up. Now I have to get this off my chest and hope to save some others who, like me, really hoped this was a great answer to recording at a great price. It's not. It's junk. I keep trying to believe that there is something I could do with this unit. But I can't. It is cheaply built, it records badly, the drivers don't install right, Cubase LE is worthless, the Pantheon 'Verb is a joke (might be OK if you are doing some REALLY cheesy new age stuff, but even then it would be a thick wad of cheese fluff). There is nothing worth having in this package. Buy something else. Buy ANYTHING else. Buy a cheap hand held cassette recorder. At least you can record with it. Better yet, by a Zoom H4 and download audiocity and you will have the ultimate portable studio for home and live. I wish I did..."
5,Outstanding Interface Recording Unit,"My opinion of the Omega, after owning and operating one for over a year, is that it, in conjunction with a good computer, can produce fantastic quality recordings. I've found the Omega to have a steep learning curve that requires some reading and experimenting, but the results are stunning when compared with analog tape machines or early entry digital devices. I've had to add some memory to my RAM and have upgraded my Cubase to a better version than LE-there always seems to be more to do or learn-but right now I'm having lots of fun with this machine and it hasn't failed me once. Love it;)"
3,Great for you Justin!-now you can afford an Editor,"We were quite impressed with the chef and his parents for encouraging Justin-way to go!! For the next book, I would suggest a cookbook editor to proof the recipes...of course there is no substitute for parental suppervision-but some parents are non-cooks and wouldn't catch things like 'blend all' directions when making French Toast! We did, but I felt sorry for the others..."
3,Too many cooks in the kitchen,"....These [recipes] are definetly written by a child and often are missingsteps or are confusing. For example in ""Sydney's SailingShips"" mayonnaise is a listed ingredient but is completely leftout of the steps. In a ""Hannah's Banana French Toast"" thefirst step says to put all ingredients in blender, mix well. Well, inwent the bread and out came slop, my son was dissappointed and felt hehad done something wrong. In short this book is worth having, we arehaving fun with it and the recipes and resulting dishes are appealingto children and adults, but you definetly need to fill in the gaps foryour child."
3,"Peepers, Creepers","I am a huge Michael Caine AND Natalie Wood fan since the Mid-Sixties and I have never heard of this movie til it came out on DVD. How could such an ideal movie match-up escape me? This looks on the outset that it could rival the chemistry of Gambit. Our stars do deliver: Caine is still slim and Harry Palmerish and Natalie is stunningly beautiful. No question they work great together. But the problem about this mystery is the plot: the scenes keep going by and I don't really know what is the point. Caine is trying to solve something about which lady is the missing twin, I think, and for what purpose, I'm not sure. I lay the blame at Hyam's feet. In his interview, he admits the film tested badly, but doesn't seem to know why. Obviously, audiences were too baffled by the murky plot to fully enjoy the Caine/Wood combo. Fans of either should watch this, but don't expect the cleverness of a Gambit."
1,Painful,"There are some stylish production touches and the DVD looks good, but this is nearly unwatchable. Is it screwball or noir? The jokes fall flat and there's no real tension. Caine and Wood are okay, but everyone else is playing to the back row. (The climax's eerie foreshadowing of Wood's death doesn't exactly add to the enjoyment.)"
3,Michael Caine Private Eye Caper from 1976,"With Michael Caine as a down-at-heels, in-over-his-head 1940s private eye, and Natalie Wood as a femme fatale, this film's problem isn't in casting. And any movie with character actors like Thayer David and Timothy Carey essaying the bad guys is worth watching for that alone. Additionally, Peter Hyams' direction is smooth and production values are top flight. What's needed is a much tighter script or at least one with a sharper satirical edge that doesn't drift off into slapstick every couple of scenes. What makes its failing all the more regrettable is the talent Hyams demonstrated just four years before directing and writing Goodnight, My Love, a TV movie that was an extraordinary salute to Forties private eyedom. It had Richard Boone and Michael Dunne as two sleuths involved in a case that might have amused Raymond Chandler. And when will somebody make this little masterpiece available on DVD?"
4,Peeper the sleeper,The is an underappreciated movie starring Michael Caine as the private detective (Peeper) and the always stunning Natalie Wood. Give it a try.
3,Boy in Wonderland and back,"A Belgium story of a mental man-among-teens (or all they are the same-it is hard to understand as actors look too mature for school folks?) incorporates interesting ideas of a virtual space as a new living demention of the new millennium and a degree of idiocy oncoming generations should acquire to be modern citizens.It is notJulien Donkey-Boybut a happy-end story of a bulled pupil, suicide staged and coming back.So-so."
5,"Creative Stoicism, with and powerful story to tell","The films centers around a teenager with autism (Asperger Syndrome to be more specific) that has to fight his extraordinary life in order to fit socially I an ordinary world, beyond autism, themes such as school bullying, and violence as well as suicide, and social reactions to underdogs are covered in this beautifully crafted cinematic story. This is one of those oddly feel good films that will leave you entertained, but also with a plenty of ideas about life , existence , and the way we as human interact with each others , to reflect upon. I believe every parent show introduce their adolescent children to this film at their on discretion, in a way to help them reflect on how to be better social individuals."
5,this is what it would be like to have autism,"As the parent and step parent of two boys who have Asperger's Syndrome, I can say on pretty good authority that this film does a very good job of giving the audience an accurate sensory experience of what it's like to be on the autism spectrum. The loud unrelenting noises that you can't filter, the visual focus on teeny tiny details, the literal interpretation of speech. The way above average sharpness of the intellect. And how it feels to always be the outsider. Excluded. Misunderstood. Shamed. Ridiculed. This film takes you on a very special journey. It's not an easy journey, it's not always pretty, and it's not always a happy result. But it's an important journey for neural-normal people to walk for 100 minutes in neural atypical people's shoes. Films like this one will never be blockbusters or make the director rich, but they can help the rest of us find our humanity."
4,What I was looking for,"Almost as soon as I received this book, and had had time only to skim it, a friend saw it on my table and was so interested in it that I let her take it home to read it. Consequently, I am not able to write a review at this time."
3,Technically great but where's the music?,"Give Richard Leo Johnson his due: he takes the slides and quirky rhythms of Leo Kottke, the percussive taps and boinks of Preston Reed, the harmonic attacks of Michael Hedges, and adds a touch of Bill Frissell and produces an amazing amalgam of acoustic guitar artristy. I honestly can't listen to this album all the way through; it is tiring to my ear. The technical gee-whiz-look-at-me-now onslaught on every song hides the music. Richard Leo Johnson is a fanatastic guitar player, but he's trying to hard."
5,Grateful for film preservation,"Thanks to the folks at UCLA, Film Noir Foundation and Stanford Theatre Foundation for restoring this lost classic and VCI for making it available to the public. The restoration is superb. The film is great. The DVD quality is excellent. What more is there to say. If your a fan of classic film noir then this is for you."
4,Standard Straight Noir.,A NOIR that can be stomached by most people. A simple straight story line. Not too mean like some. Girl looks good enough to watch. Acceptable Noir so to speak almost prime time TV. Probably too much for kids but fine for adults that don't want the total trashing that modern movies give.
4,The Prowler,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Should have passed on this one!,Film noir is my favorite genre and I am garnering a collection of what I consider some of the best of the genre...this is not one of them! I loved Van Heflin in the Strange Loves of Martha Ivers (in my opinion a noir classic) here the script just doesn't work for anybody not even Heflin!
5,Double Indemnity's poor second cousin.,Wonderfully thrilling B movie from the early fifties directed by Joseph Losey and beautifully shot by Arthur Miller. Taut and intelligent with a brilliant performance by the under rated Van Heflin.
5,"Maximum help, low level comprehension","I am an RN with FM. I have found Miryam's book to be excellent, no nonsense assistance that can be readily incorporated into everyday life. I keep it in the bathroom to review areas I'm having difficulty with while I'm ""resting""."
4,"A comprehensive, easy-to-understand masterpiece!","I have read this book several times -- mainly because as my own fibromyalgia symptoms change, I need to focus on some other aspect to help myself get through it. This book provides that. No 10-syllable words, no promises of backflips by the end of the book. But what you do get is a genuine understanding of what is going on inside your body and what you can do to help yourself."
1,Perhaps ok for a starting point.,"For the newly dx patient, this book has some of the answers. Unfortunately, they are spread very thin by trying to cover a very wide range of cases and situations.There are more comprehensive books on the market that offer a bigger bang for the buck. Check out those by Devin Starlanyl for more complete information for both the patient and the professional."
3,A o.k. book,Somewhat boring in the descriptive writing the story is still exciting. Espicilly at the end of the book you can't put it down. Christies characters perfect and have a great personality. Despite some of the bore the book is still fun to read.
1,This book was boring and in my opinion had a bad plot.,"Gabriel CoronaFive Little Pigs by Agatha ChristieThis book Three Little Pigs ,Christie was not as good as I it to be expected, in myopinion. I found it to be dull and repetitive,and it having no originality throughout thewhole book. The idea of trying to solve a murder that took place sixteen years ago is theonly aspect of the book which I found interesting. Though I do not know AgathaChristie's work, but by judging from this book I would think that she was not such a goodwriter. Even though I do not find this book appealing, other readers who are interested inlong explanation and great thought into a problem in order to get a solution would find .the book interestingI would recommend this book for readers who like to read thing sover again in order to come up with new information that is more interesting and can bemore conclusive."
3,Missing something?,"did i miss something? because everyone here gives this book high praise. not that i didn't enjoy the plot, but 16 years is a long time to go back and judge a crime. also, we get the same story like 12 times because we hear it twice from each ""pig"" and from some random people at the beginning. this plot would've made a better movie, and it did in the adaptation for tv. but it is all dialogue in very large and run-on chunks and there is no crime scene to analyze and even i guessed the murderer. not her best."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"After being given the arse at the end of The Honourable Schoolboy, yet again they decide they have need of Smiley's talents after an old agent, a Russian, is killed.They realise Smiley is the man for the job if they are to finally get to the Russian spymaster guru Karla by an operation designed to leave the man between a rock and a hard place."
5,Incredible Story,"This book provides a great story about an incredible discovery. I really enjoyed the balance between Roberts' historical perspective and Anker's first-hand experience. While we may never know for sure whether Mallory and Irvine made the summit, or what exactly happened on their final attempt to reach the summit, this book provides solid information and analysis via thoroughly enjoyable writing, which is more than we've ever had before. Excellent job!"
5,As Close to the Real Truth as One Could Imagine,"This story is told in a dual format style; Anker uses the 1st person and Roberts the third, recounting the history of the 1924 British expedition, and the loss of Mallory and Irvine. The backgrounds of both these hardy early climbers is investigated in great detail, including several earlier scouting expeditions.The book was a fabulous read and I finished it in two sittings. I was interested in the subject, having seen the BBC/NOVA TV production and heard the comments of other climbers on the discovery of the lost Mallory.I was impressed on the multi-points-of-view taken by both co-authors, and the discussions of what the range of possibilities were for the results that were discovered. At the same time, there are many interesting yarns recounted by both writers, themselves very strong and sensitive adventurers.If you are going to read only one book on the subject, let it be this one!!"
3,little too much ego here,"I bought the book, and read it cover to cover, as all Everest fans must. I respect Conrad Anker's abilities, but consider him lacking as an author. While his desriptions of the technical aspects of the climb were mostly fascinating, his routine ""shots"" at the ""lesser"" members of the team (which includes everyone else) leaves a bad taste. David Roberts related a lot of the interesting prior history surrounding George Mallory's quest for Everest, and that was appropriate, but he spends too much time in his adulation of Conrad, and in his own quest to implant literary anachronisms into the book, to get my vote. For my money, I'd rather read a few paragraphs written by Dave Hahn regarding the price of tacos in Taos, than to read anything written by these two fellows."
3,An Amazing Story,"I really enjoyed the history in this book. It's a fast read and is pretty well written, yet I wish Conrad had written it all by himself. Even though his analysis of the fate of Mallory and Irvine is rational and well-argued, I'm not convinced. I still tend to think that Odell, being the last person to see the pair alive and believing they topped the second step, is to be trusted."
3,Tiresome adventure,"Gave perfect comparison-contrast of '20's climning to 90's climbing. This book was not the most riveting adventure tale but enjoyable to say the least. To say that Anker, coauthor of the book along with David Roberts who has also teamed up with Krakauer, was vain in this book is a bit harsh. Anker accounts for the find of Mallory and his personal climb to the top of the world. Roberts condenses the info on Mallory into pure-meat information."
5,beautiful love story,"this is a beautiful love story,and a classic,set during WW1 & 11.. a MUST SEE & WORTH KEEPING FOR ADDITIONAL VIEWING!!!"
4,Great blues-rock album,"I have finally been re-united with this excellent, mainly blues-rock album from 1988. The best track on the album is the soul ballad ""I'll Be There With You"". But there are other great tracks like ""Hoo Doo Eyes"", ""Walked From Dallas"" or ""HPD"" (Short for Houston Police Department) or ""Mississippi Delta Blues"". Houston-based guitarist and singer Rocky Hill is sadly no longer with us. This is some of his finest work."
1,ouot-of-date map,"Getting lost in Manchester, England several times in one day - weasked people for help showing our ""new"" map and were told it wasout of date. Got some laughs at some places. We were very disappointed."
4,One of their best,"This is where they really started pulling together their sound -- better songs, not as brooding and clunky as the previous records. Not everything is perfect, but most of it is very good. Why Won't You Stay, Confidential Agent, Ex-Girlfriend, Crabwalk and Royal Cafe are all-timers for me, and Jesus's Hands might be the best album closer I've ever heard.Their subsequent records for the major labels had some standout tracks but never really captured the overall feel of Everclear. Recording-wise, this record might be their peak if you're looking at the entire package."
5,everclear is amazing,"everclear always puts out an outstanding set of songs, and this cd is no different."
4,",","This was one of my favorite folk tales growing up.I'm not sure I like the layout of this book, in comic style, I think it's a little hard to read, but my nieces enjoy it and I haven't yet found a better edition of JUST this folk tale."
2,Too Silly even for kids,"I've really enjoyed Kellogg's Pinkerton books, but this one's a dud. The best thing about this book was the wonderful illustrations and the only reason I gave it 2, rather than 1 star. I think my friend's 6 year old child put it appropriately - the book is weird and doesn't make any sense. It was so absurd and ridiculous as to be frustrating...not even my 3 year old found it fun. Maybe 4 or 5 year olds would, but no one younger would understand the story since it makes no sense really, and anyone older than 5 would think it too strange to enjoy. Kellogg should stick with a good thing like Pinkerton."
4,Lorena's spell on the locket,"Better than the first story in the Blackstone Chronicles. More frightening too because it didn't turn out as I expected. They did rush Jules into madness a little too fast. It would've been better if after he got ""the locket"" that he slowly became paranoid. Not in just one big dose. Still better than the first. --NA"
2,Not again!,"Dear Mr. Saul, the story itself is quite suitable for a horror-novel but why did you have to repeat exactly the same story as in part one? You just changed the gift, the family and the way the person(s) get killed. This is not enough. I hope this series improves soon.."
3,"Strange, Strange, Strange","What in the world is with these heirlooms that keep showing up?This was a little better than the first volume, but only a little."
3,Is there anything about flying?!,"This was a good listen but the series takes 5.5 tapes out of 6 to get to the part I wanted to hear, about WWII flying. Not the best title for this book. Should have been ""What I did before I earned my wings of honor"".The book had some interesting parts, but thank god Im a history buff or I would have thrown it in the garbage. Did not relate much to what I thought it was about."
3,For you and your team,"April, 2002You should read Managing Upward by Patti Hathaway & Susan Schubert. The topic touches most everyone. Since I just changed jobs, it came at just the right time.It has all the ingredients I look for in a book:-- A relevant topic - like most of us, I have a boss.-- Easy to read - without the fluff.-- Short chapters I can read in those brief periods of idle time.-- Practical suggestions I can immediately apply.The one complaint is there are too many self-assessments. But don't let that stand in your way of a valuable addition to your library.Not only do I recommend the book for you in dealing with your boss; I encourage you to provide copies for your direct reports."
1,Love OXO kitchen products but not this one...,Don't waste your money...buy Craftsman at similar value but superior quality to this one. I bought it as a gift for my husband for Christmas thinking it would be handy but it's cheap and not of OXO calibur...we were surprised. We sent it back.
3,Fishing,The rod appeared to be very sturdy but on the first time I went fishing with it the tip snapped off when I got stuck and pulled it.
1,the worst products are from o'sullivan,All products from o'sullivan industries are a nigtmare to assemble their customer service is bad and the quality is the worst
3,Item APPEARS to be satisfactory,"The item is resilient, but not sure for how long. Other reviewer mentioned that the seam leaked after a while but I'll keep a close eye on mine and report my findings. It is possible he didn't have enough water to boil in it; thus cracking the enamelware making it leak. I test equipment like this in controlled areas to see how long they last and how they stand up to abuse.WARNING: The item must never be put over a hot surface (such as fire) without liquid food or water in it! Make sure to never put this item in cold water when hot, it will crack the enamel and your percolator will be useless.The percolator system itself is made of aluminum, can't really complain about that but may give your coffee or boiled water a ""metal"" taste. You'll need to buy some wrap-around coffee filters for tea, coffee, wild herbs but I think this product should have included a few filters free of charge."
5,A MODERN CLASSIC!!!,"Chris Knight is a true blue from the soul musician. In these ""dark days"" of fluffy sweet contemporary ""pop country"" Knight is a brilliant ray of light. Raw, honest and true, this is what country was meant to be.In my humble opinion, Chris Knight is the answer to that Jones classic: ""Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes?""My recommendation is: BUY ALL 3 of KNIGHT'S CD's and see him live if you are able. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!"
1,Sorry this cd just LAME!,"Chris what has happen you have great song writing but this cd is a big snooze. The first self titled cd blow's this way outta hear!First the production stink's the vocals need to be turned up and get rid of all that other clatter Guitar, bass and drum's is all you need and drink a Red Bull or Mountain Dew AND LET LOOSE with that voice add some grit like the first cd that is the Blueprint to Follow for a way better cd!"
1,I would not buy this product.,It sounded very bad. It's not a good product to buy. I have to return it.
3,not as advertised,"This is not pie crust. It is soft graham cracker powder in an aluminum pie pan. When the pan cover is removed the soft graham cracker powder falls apart when placing filling in the pan and then trying to remove a portion. I scoop out the powder and place it in a bowl then add some filling and mix it up and serve portions on to a plate. Tastes ok this way. This graham cracker pie crust is NOT firm, hard or sweet like the ones you get in the grocery store. It is a cheap knockoff. Dont buy."
1,crumbly graham,Package arrived yesterday and today I used one crust --- it was totally crumbly...powder...nothing solid about it. Very disappointing. I guess I have to go back to making my own crusts.
5,50/50 Sugar -Free Pie Crust,"I Have two diabetics in my family, this is a delicious dessert for them,I fill with sugar free pudding. I keep the pie crust in the freezer until needed, my non diabetic daughter likes these better than regular graham pie crust"
5,An excellent resource,"After three years of infertility due to endometriosis, we had given up hope. After eight months on this diet we were expecting our first child with no medical intervention. Even if you aren't trying to conceive, this diet DOES help you feel a lot better."
5,The Best Endo Book,"If your looking for a book about this condition, please, be very careful about evaluating what you read. When I started researching this condition I was really dissappointed in the number of outdated books that are still available in most bookstores. I picked up a book that was originally published in '89, and the figures it gave for fertility after a lap were devastating (and no longer valid). This is the only Endo book I've found outside a medical library that adequately describes this rotten disease. It makes no great promises and it doesn't sugar coat anything; it feels completely honest and helpful. If you really want to get control of your body, you have to know precisely what it is that's gone wrong, and exactly how desicions about your lifestyle will affect your condition. This is the only book I've found that made me feel like I could do that."
5,Awesome!!,"one of the best cd's this year. the production is tight. much better than other ""major"" label releases."
4,Not just for dust heads,"When I heard that Cage and Tame One of Eastern Conference were getting together to make an album entirely about angel dust, i was a little skeptical. Despite the singular topic matter, the album is diverse; 100% cracked out rhymes by both Cage and Tame who have stepped up lyrically from their previous releases. The beats come from a variety of big underground names: Mighty Mi, J-Zone, Camu Tao, RJD2, El-P and others, each providing a different soundscape for the leak bros. demented lyrics. My favorite cut would have to be RJD2s cinematic ""Gimme Some Death"". The only cuts I didn't like was J-Zones as it sounded too much like one of the beats he gave Akinyele and El-Ps. The only guest is Yak Ballz on the hook of the first song. If you are a fan of the Definitive Jux or Eastern Conference rappers, or of rappers in the horrorcore genre, check out this album."
1,Rocking Chair,"Though this chair looked so cute, it was for a very big (over 6) kid and not for a little princess. The wood cracked when I tried to assemble it, and the return took over a month to receive credit. They finally did credit my account."
5,Great compilation if you're getting just one CD,"The classics are all here -- the Parrot Sketch, the Cheese Shop, the Spanish Inquisition and more. And they are produced for audio, which is an improvement on simply capturing the TV sketches on tape. I happen to love the Four Yorkshiremen, all trying to outdo the others' growing-up-in poverty stories. Also, there's something about Aussie sketches (Australian table wines and the Bruces) that hits my funny bone particularly hard.Not a bad choice if you are planning to by exactly one Python CD. Otherwise, spend $40 on The Instant Monty Python CD Collection for the best bang for your buck."
2,One CD for the price of one,"Aptly named, this ""twofer"" has good tracks from previous albums, but an equal amount of styrofoam packing material in the shape of monumentally boring unfunny stuff such as Traffic Lights and I'm So Worried to live versions of fundamentally good sketches (eg Dead Parrot) which are not as polished (or audible)as the original studio versions.If they had just put the good stuff on a single CD and provided a cork disc in the other compartment, they could have called it Matching CD and Beer Mat."
2,Uh... I Remember it Better,I memorized the three famous Monty Python albums of the early 1970's but I haven't listened to them in years and I just got this CD collection. Some of the routines hold up well (Novel Writing). Some seem tired to me. Some of them seem to have been re-mastered and made to sound worse (The Cheese Shop?). And having them taken out of their original flow and contexts makes me feel like I've visited an old neighborhood that has changed more than I want. Maybe it's a good introduction for you fresh young folks to whom it's new. I feel sorry for you to hear the live versions with the actors shouting all their lines and the audience so predisposed to laughter that all the subtlety of the original versions is lost. But it's an overview...
4,"Verry funny, but don't let children listen to it.","It is very entertaining, but there is some vulgar language and adult topics. But overall the set is side-splitting."
5,AWESOME,"The wait was worth it. This CD's got it all, from the classic punk-ska supertones sound to Sublime style songs. It's also got some great rapping reminiscent of 311. The only song that I didn't really like that much was Hallelujah, and thats just because I don't like reggae too much."
5,The Supertones Srtike Back Again!,"I found the new album very AWESOME DUDE! I love the songs GROUNDED, IN BETWEEN, FADE AWAY, HALLELUIJAH, SURE SHOT, oh, I guess I love then all. I can't wait to see then at SWC again. They are taking the WORLD by storm. Their new album is the best yet, and their next one will be too! Shank for Jesus!"
4,Excellent album,"Their 3rd album Chase The Sun is a good album but needs a little improvement on their music. I would have gave this album 5 stars if it weren't for those dumb trombone and trumphet they really mess up songs that are sooo good like Chase The Sun. It was sooo good and fun until those 2 instruments came in. The good news is that the Supertones at least lost one of their band member who played the horns (which made this album a lot better than lost one bleah). Otherwise this album is excellent and probably is going to be one of the biggest Christian albums of '99. The best song on this whole album was Away From You with Crystal Lewis. Other good songs were One Voice, In Between, and Old Friend. For you Ska lovers you'll hate this album. For you party animals and rock with horns in it lovers you love this album. Also what's cool about this album there's one rap song in it called Chase The Sun. I wonder why they would put horns in rap song?! Well in all this album is excellent"
4,Too much hip hop Ska Punk is really needed,This album is hard to listen to for me because the first supertones cd is so much diffenrent.Pretty soon the supertones are going to be Audio Adrenline or some crap like that.Nice Praise songs.Ska but not ska ska ska.Ska fans beware.
5,The Happy Music is Back!,The Mighty West Side Supertones are still neutral as a Nazi and their lyrics prove it! Stay Strong Supertones!
3,Almost wanted to give it only 2 stars.,"Sorry, I had to say it. After listening to some of their better albums such as, ""Adventures in the O.C."" and ""Supertones Strike Back"", I was expecting so much more from ""Chase the Sun."" Unfortunately it just didn't live up to my expectations at all. Most of the tunes in this album lack the richness in harmony found in the earlier ""Supertones Strike Back""; Unfortunately, ""Chase"" comes off as a watered-down sequel to their earlier albums. This is like the Supertones' own ""Highlander 2"", if you know what I mean."
3,"Not punk /ska ,but still good","This is not punk/ska.Its a good mix of ska(yes their is a difference between ska and punk/ska),reggae,and surf rock(with a bit of punk,surf punk,and alternative mixed in).This sounds nothing like old Supertones but is still good.This album was engineered by Darren Grahn(Bryan Adams,Metallica)which I think is a definent plus.On the downside,the Supertones replaced their awesome old guitarist(Kevin Chen)with Brian Johnson and altogether dropped their sax player(Dave Chevalier),which altered their sound even more.Also,the title track,""Chase the Sun"",gets rather old.In my opinion,this album is worth buying despite the negatives.For the most part,CHASE THE SUN is a well done album full of upbeat,enjoyable, rythems.I personally enjoyed ""Hallelua"",""Away From You"",""Old Friend"",""One Voice"",and ""Dedication"" the best,although most all were good."
5,"Very, very cool!",I've already worn this CD out! My whole family knows the words(my dog occasionally sings along!) My recomendation: buy this CD!! It kicks!!
4,it kicks!,"This is my first Supertones CD. I like all the songs, but Revolution is my favorite. I recommend this CD!"
4,"Gets better every time you listen to it, you'll wear it out!","A bit different than ""Supertones Strike Back"", this is one of those albums that really grows on you. Now when someone says that about an album, it usually means ""stay away"", but I'd HIGHLY recommend this album. The Supertones have an ability to sing net-it-out Christian tunes that are fun to listen to (they ROCK) while sharing the Gospel. A must...!"
5,I NEED THIS,Hi. I love this baby doll and carrier. It looks so cute. All the La Baby dolls are great. As well as the other dolls by Berenguer. I'm 12 years old and I love dolls. This is a must have doll for any child. Now all I need to do is buy a twin stroller cause I have so many dolls! Bye*****************************PEACE EVERYWHERE*******************
2,This baby STINKS !!!,"The baby itself is really sweet looking... my daughter loves it... BUT... it has a STRONG smell of roses that does not go away. So, people who are sensitive to smells or have allergies may want to think twice. As much as she likes this baby... it may need to go back as my eyes are watering."
5,"A great gift for an ""Girly"" golfer!","My assistant plays golf every week, and these are her favorite balls. She says that they play very well, and the colors are a nice change of tradition. It was nice to get someone a gift that they really liked!"
4,Pink Golf Balls,This was a gift for our daughter and she likes the pink golf balls because her grandmother died from breast cancer. This is our way of helping to fight cancer.
2,It worked for a month,"This battery was a great price. I thought so anyway until I tried to take a picture with my camera and it wouldn't turn on. I assumed I just forgot to recharge it. But no, one month and a few charges is all it lasted."
1,This battery will kill you digital camera,"I got 2 battery for my EOS Rebel Canon Camera. The first day I use one it just Kill my CCD on my camera. I test the battery volt's and find out that this battery give you a little more that this camera will need, killing you CCD system. My camera is know for repair."
1,short-lived generic junk: get what you pay for,"Haha, PREMIUM! Just junk! Don't buy these generics, you'll regret it. The original Canon battery lasted over four years and I was too cheap to buy another.This knockoff lasted only about 6 months and around 3 charges before it died. Will no longer accept any charging. Off to the recycling center. This is the 2nd generic battery pack I've purchased for a digital camera that lasts under a year. No more generics, I'm sticking to the ""overpriced"" name-brands."
3,Good for AMC/Eitzel Completists,"There are better acoustic versions of ""Chanel No. 5"" and ""Crabwalk"" on Mark Eitzel's ""Songs of Love Live"" cd, but the track ""The Right Thing"" is a very pleasant rarity. This version has a different cover than the original 1991 Alias single. Regardless of its overall quality, even average AMC was always better than their contemporaries. Not the greatest place to start, but a wonderful place to return to if you were there to begin with."
1,fifty 50 almond bars,"My order for fifty 50 almond chocolate bars arrived very very rancid and inedible. Needless to say, they went in the trash. Money wasted. NancyFifty-50 Crunch Chocolate Bars, 2.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)"
3,Not bad...Thrilling...And OK,"This book describes what it is like to be a fighter pilot - from the biplanes of World War I to the jet fighters of Viet Nam. The best stories were from the Viet Nam era, one from Korea and a few from World War II - especially the story from Ted Lawson (30 Seconds Over Tokyo) and the story about the Enola Gay. Wow! The rest of the stories were OK but I didn't find them to be a knock-down jaw dropper as others found them. Nevertheless, what each of these pilots went through is amazing. It's just that some of the stories were OK to read, but others from the book were fascinating...therefore the 3 stars. I do recommend the book to any aviation enthusiast."
5,Is this studio snoring?,"Glenn Ford was one of our Western greats yet many of his greatest movies are unavailable on DVD. What gives???? When does this one come out on DVD? And while we're at it where's ""The Fastest Gun Alive"" on DVD, or where period is ""The Sheepman""? Some Executives must be rollin' in the dough because they absolutely seem to refuse to make another buck."
5,Hard to find movie,This is my father's favorite movie. It is old enough that it is not even available on tape. To be able to have a DVD made of this and give it to my father made for a terrific gift.
4,fun film,"I saw this many years ago and never forgot it, so finally decided to look it up. Amazon came through for me. Just as good as I remembered with two of the greatest stars of all time, Henry Fonda and Glenn Ford."
5,Totally Southwest Cowboy,"I have sat and watched this movie several times and I've enjoyed it more each time. Ford and Fonda are a great cowboy team. With the spectacular scenery of Sedona and surrounding Arizona territory, this makes for a superb afternoon at the movies."
4,Remastered But not Forgotten; Rust Never Sleeps?,"Rollins' sonorously melodic classic album provides bridge from older innovators Parker, Coletrane, ""Birth of Cool"" Davis and Mod. Jazz Quartet to Latter Day Saints Coleman and others. A rare and surprising glimpse into the virtousity and technical aspects of a sometimes underrated master"
5,Some of Sonny's Best,"A rare combination of awesome musicianship and sheer enjoyability; Rollins is at the top of his game, Jay Jay Johnson heads up a stellar combo including giants Horace Silver and Paul Chambers..."
4,One of the best album covers ever!,"Yeah, I love the cover of this album. Reid Miles and Francis Wolff were stinkin' geniuses. And Sonny and crew are playing pretty good here. I don't consider this essential Sonny, but it does have Thelonious Monk, Art Blakey and Paul Chambers (wow). ""Misterioso"" and ""You Stepped Out of a Dream"" are reason enough to check out this solid session."
4,Expected a lot and it was even better,"It's not fair that this guy is so well rounded as to write a novel this compelling and engaging. Those are just common adjectives. For a certain reader of this genre this is really, really good. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is it didn't change my life to millionaire status or make a supermodel stalk me."
5,A true guide,"If you like to learn from examples and illustrations, and do not have too much time to waste with long explanations, this book is for you. All the major topics of C++ are covered in a nicely structured series of 33 chapters. To name a few:-Pointers-Classes-Methods-Overloading-Dynamic Memory Allocation-Inheritance-Polymorphism-Abstract Classes-Exception Handling-Templates-Containers-etcEvery topic in a given chapter is typically introduced in two pages, the first with an illustration and/or a sample code, followed by a clear and concise discussion of the topic, including its motivation and caveats. The discussion on pointers is particularly illuminating, as well as the discussion on Classes and Object Oriented Programming, which is after all the heart of C++.I would not recommend this book for someone who does not have any previous exposure to a structured computer language, but it is definetely a great guide and reference on C++ for those already familiar with C, Pascal, etc."
4,Resource for preparing for Sunday School of youth age,Great resource for preparing study to teach youth in Sunday School. Also resource to help expand on stories used in VBS.
2,Fascinating topic but so far author's not doing it for me.,"Let me preface this with the statement that I'm only 1/3 a way through. I find the topic fascinating and was anticipating learning a greater appreciation of Jesus' teaching based on the audience he spoke to. So far, though, the book hasn't been too enlightening. I have to add that the writing style is poor and highly repetitive. Furthermore, the fact that the two editors are also the one's quoted on the back cover should have been a red flag. Oh well, I'll keep plowing along and amend thisreview in case the author does a better job."
1,WARNING - COPY PROTECTED!!!,"This is a copy protected cd! Don't support the practice, don't buy this! Be forewarned. Amazon should include this information in its product description, as it is material, but they do not."
3,A must read for current and future academics,"I am a doctoral student who plans to seek a job as a professor when I graduate. As such I picked up this book to learn more about my intended career. It is well written, easy to read, highly informative and very balanced. It addresses the variations in tenure across the US and the world, its history, pros and cons, uses, and possible changes to it. Tenure is one of those political hot potatoes that always remains under the media's radar, even though educational institutions across America and their funding sources are wrestling with it. I recommend this book to anyone who intends to pursue a career in higher education or academia."
4,AND I'M GONNA DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN,"I've been a fan of World/Inferno Friendship Society for a while, but I have yet to go to one of their shows. This cd gets me pretty damn close.Sometimes it amazes how much their live performances match up with their studio songs (in this cd, Younger Man and Let's Steal Everything are comparable to the recordings on Red-Eyed Soul). Many bands cannot do that.As a bonus, Jack's suave little intervening episodes are sure to entertain.The quality is so good. Extremely enjoyable."
2,A throwaway book,"""Jedi Trial"" adds little to the Star Wars expanded universe. It has a linear plot and poor character development. It does not feel like a Star Wars book. There are many little inconsistencies between this book and the movies/TV shows/other books. Skip this book."
2,Juvenile fiction???,"This book has some potential, but suffers from some lackluster writing. I'm not sure if this book was intended for a younger audience, but it was written as if it were. The language is very simple, and not very descriptive. Often it reads like a script, person A walks in the room, person B says something, person A says something, etc. Very little is done to set the scene and describe the surroundings or the emotions of the characters.As for the story itself, there was good and bad. Unfortunately the bad stands out more than the good. The dialogue and the characters were often very cheesy and simplistic. Two of the main characters, a scout and a pilot, were two of the cheesiest cookie cutter characters I've read in a long time. I literally rolled my eyes as I read how their subplot wrapped up.I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't get past the simple writing and the simple characters. There's just not enough depth to this book to really enjoy it."
1,So sad,"I am not sure who okayed this book to be written but, whoa, missed the boat on that one! This is the only Star Wars book I have ever not finished. The writing was like something out of fourth grade fan-fiction. The dialogue made me cringe, but when read out loud brought many a laugh to friends and family. Probably not what the author's had in mind. I would have to most definitely not recommend this book."
3,Just filler material,"Jedi Trial can be summed up by the following: A military novel set in a Star Wars Universe. Obi-Wan is away, so Anakin befriends Nejaa Halcyon another Jedi Knight, who has been down on his luck with the Jedi Council given his past assignment. The two get to team up with the blessings of the Jedi Council to help out Praesitlyn, where the Separatists have taken hostage the folks of the Intergalactic Command Center. Since I'm a reader of techno thrillers, this book had some good action with military planning and battles. We can see Anakin delve deep into the Force beyond what is good, leading toward his turn to the Dark Side. I found Halcyon rather weak as a Jedi. The other characters in the book, both good and evil, were filler. SPOILER: On the cover of the book lurks Asajj Ventress, who does not make a physical appearance is this book, but just shows up in a few sentences over the HoloNet to talk to Pors Tonith, leader of this Separatist army about his progress."
3,Not the Best,"This would have gotten 2 Stars, had it not been for a wonderful section towards the end, where anakin is confronted by ghosts of his past. Too much military lingo and battlefield strategies for a fan of the series. They really lacked the Jedi foundation found in Shatterpoint and The Cestus Deception. I was not impressed with this one. Thought , it is a good one if you like the military stuff and star wars, but i am a Jedi guy through n through, not a military man."
2,Don't Bother,"This book is poorly written and extremely boring. Even if you're trying to read all of the Clone Wars novels, do yourself a favor and skip this one. It's not worth the money, and it's not worth your wasted time.If you're looking for good Clone Wars novels, try these: ""Yoda: Dark Rendevous"", ""Republic Commando: Hard Contact"", and ""The Cestus Deception"". I have yet to read ""Labyrinth of Evil"" (prequel to episode III) but I expect it to be good.- Chris, a moderate Star Wars fan"
1,Just plain horrible,"Have these people ever heard of an editor, numerous mis-spellings.The most annoying thing though, was how the writers kept refering to thier charicters by first name only, yet kept calling the main charicters by thier full names (Odie, Erk, Anakin Skywalker)If you gotta read them all, go for it. But if your just looking for a good Star Wars novel start somewhere else like ""I, Jedi"""
1,This is the worst SW novel I've ever read.,"This book has no redeeming qualities about it, whatsoever. Character development was horrible, and not believable. Don't waste your time on this book, it is the worst SW novel I've ever read (I've read close to 30)"
2,Disappointing and lacking substance.,"I was excited to read Jedi Trial because it is the first of the Clone Wars novel to feature Anakin as a central character. I was sorely disappointed upon reading the book, however. It doesn't have the feel of other great Star Wars books and the authors are pretty poor writers in my opinion. The book is lacking much of a plot development and the dialogue and characters are both very wooden and lacking substance.While the book claims to be about Anakin, I found that I was let down by the abysmal portrayal of him through the book and it was fairly obvious that the authors weren't too familiar with the Star Wars saga and shouldn't have been invited into its wonderful expanded universe."
1,Could Have Been So Much Better,The battles were very cool but everything else could have been better. I was dying to see Anakin's Jedi Trial. To see what exactly a real Jedi trial is. But we don't get to see it even thought its all Anakin talks about. Obi Wan is sent on a mission without Anakin so Anakin gets a new master temporarily in Jedi Halcyon. I was very interested in seeing how this played out. Anakin having a master who wasn't Obi Wan and one who was a lot like him. Considered a maverick or wild card of the Jedi. They have a lot in common including having a love one even though its against of the Jedi Order. They would have made for an interesting team and yet they weren't. They were more boring then I ever could have thought.
2,Authors not familiar with the SW universe,"Jedi Trial is the 15th or 16th Star Wars novel I've read/listened to, and I must be nearing the bottom of the barrel. Jedi Trial is written by two authors unfamiliar with the Star Wars universe, and it certainly shows. Anakin Skywalker's personality is totally at odds with anything previously (or since) written, and his part could have been played by any number of cardboard cutout Jedi. Equipment and weapons function in ways previously (or since) unknown. The authors are militaty tactical fiction writers, and they do a fine job wth the battle scenes... but the details they create don't fit with what readers know about the universe, and it's terribly distracting. Definately the WORST Star Wars novel I have read to date."
2,It showed so much promise...,"How long have SW fans waited for a Halcyon novel? Too bad this one isn't it. Nejaa should have been a high point in the Clone Wars novels, and instead we're shown a foundering, outcast Jedi who can apparently only associate with a Padawan.The action in this book is not compelling; the strategies are basic at best; and some of the Expanded Universe knowledge is wrong. The authors imply, through Halcyon, that marrying among Jedi is rare, even for Corellians. However, the (much better) book I, Jedi states that Corellians were known for doing things differently, staying in their own planetary system (it took a galactic war to bring them out) and training their own padawans. Halcyon's placement as an outcast was a horrible mischaracterization and it ruined an already mediocre book.Cross your fingers for Stackpole to write a real Nejaa Halcyon novel. Don't bother with this one in the mean time; the bad characterizations and sloppy plotting will only dishearten you."
1,How to fight a Galactic War for Dummies.,"With advance apologies to the authors of this book, I have to say this is the worst Star Wars novel out there. The attempt to bring the action in the Star Wars universe closer to reality by discussing at length what exactly the job of the quartermaster is is not only brain numbing, but useless to the ""plot"" of the book. If you do choose to endure the book simply to see how it ends as I did, you will be disappointed that all of that ""how to fight a battle and win"" knowledge that you trudged through turns into filler as Anakin does what he should have done about 150 pages before he actually does. I am sorry but the last time I checked Star Wars was a fantasy story where the main focus is the struggle between good and evil, not a documentary on how often a X-Wing needs an oil change in order to function properly. While their writing style may have it's place in stories that take place on Earth, it is not suited for a galaxy far far away."
4,SQR in PeopleSoft - Developer Review,I thought that the book was well-written and very informative. I would recommend it to any SQR developer as a reference guide.
5,Sqr in PeopleSoft and Other Applications,Finally a well writting and organized SQR with plenty of examples. Like the part that once you buy the book you can go to a web site and download all the examples.
5,An Excellent Desk Reference,I work as PeopleSoft technical consultant and use this book at least once a week when writing and/or modifying SQR programs. It's a great desktop reference book - solid examples and easy-to-understand text. I use it to supplement the technical manuals that come with the SQR product.
4,An SQR reference a must-have for any SQR developer!,"The Landres book provide a very solid introduction and expansion of SQR concepts. This book provides an excellent introduction to novice and new SQR programmers, and it is an excellent reference guide for experienced programmers. The examples of various reports are based on the PeopleSoft HRMS, but can be applied for any other application or RDBMS.The authors cover version 3.x and 4.x of Scribe's SQR. This is the first comprehensive book on SQR that I have seen and reviewed which presents the material in a logical manner which leaves the reader yearning to read on ahead.A must have for any SQR developer / programmer."
5,Polo snobs need not apply,Don't read this if you are looking for a polo primer. The book addresses the culture and the times more than the sport. And it is beautifully written.
1,Pashion Play? - I dont thnk so,"You ever read one of those books and get about a third of the way in and you say to yourself ""what the...""?Well this is one of those books.In essence its about a rather sad individual who drives across the country in a horse box with his polo ponies.Now, anyone who plays polo and reads this book will read some of the descriptions with utter astonishment. The idea that you can stop your horsebox in a middle of a city car parking lot and practise on the tarmac is to anyone who knows about horses and or polo impossible. Immediately the writers credibility goes out the window.This book is badly researched, dull in its content and baffling in its plot.The second half may be much better than the first - I wouldnt know - I never got that far."
5,An excellent one stop reference.,After returning to college after 8 years working I required a review of math concepts. Math Refresher provided all the relevant topics logically laid out in a single volume. The relatively low cost of this book compared to other math references was an additional bonus.
2,Poor Kindle Formatting,"This book is much better in the printed format. No question that the content is perfect for the intended audience, but you don't get many pages into the Kindle edition before you discover missing elements and poorly formatted equations- a disappointing purchase."
2,A Good Substitute For A Sleeping Pill,"Beautiful Planet - France & Italy arrived at my door full of promise. I love the blu-ray format, and a high definition film that captures the beauty of France and Italy had to be a sure bet. I've spent a lot of time visiting both countries, and I was looking forward to revisiting France and Italy, in the comfort of my home. I don't think I have ever spent a more boring 4 hours in all of my life. The limited geographic areas covered by the films, the inarticulate narrators, and the lack of stunning cinematography compel me to give this blu-ray 2 big thumbs down. I gave one star for just making the bloody film, and another star for effort, and the bargain basement price. Don't waste your time on these awful movies - Rick Steves has visited many of the same places on his PBS Show, and is far more enjoyable and effective in standard definition. If I have to hear the word proscenium pronounced ""pro-sheen-ium"" again - I'll scream."
1,Worst Purchase I Ever Made,"I made the mistake of buying this at Target, not knowing it was from the same group that produced the dud ""America's National Treasures"". These are unquestionably the worst purchases I've ever made. The other reviewers are spot-on. Don't waste your time, and don't be fooled by the beautiful images on the cover."
1,"Even if this was free, it would not be worth your time","Though I only spent $8 on this (from another vendor, not Amazon), it was still a waste of money. The narration is monotone, the ""script"" is essentially the monotone narrator reading off sterile details (e.g., this building has 17 doors and 30 windows....45 steps lead up to this doorway....), and there are moments when one can view dirt/water stains on the camera lens as the camera scans across the skyline for panoramic shots. Do not confuse this with the BBC's excellent ""Planet Earth"" series (which the packaging of this disappointing blu-ray mimics) - this is waste of time and money."
2,Mostly filler.,"Terrible ""documentary"". Major landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower are completely omitted in favor of dozens of shots of bland buildings and repeated generic locations. This video is 90% panning or still shots (in HD!) with small voice-over blurbs in between. There's maybe half an hour of material here stretched out over four. I think I enjoyed it as much as the narrator did."
1,Not acceptable,This travel documentary was cheaply made. It consists of poorly shot video of tourist destinations in France and Italy combined with interviews with experts and tour guides. The video is ugly and the audio is worse. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Waste of money!,"I bought mine at Target thinking of get a blue ray full of beautiful French and Italian images and some knowledge.The narrator is so dry and monotone, she puts me to sleep. Background music is so boring that silence would be more exciting. This is a huge disservice to France and Italy.I wish I bought 3 boring coffeehouse lattes instead! Too bad I can't get a refund on bad entertainment!"
1,Not worth the money!,"I love travel films, and I never get tired of Rick Steves. So, after buying this film, I felt compelled to share a review. The film was a total disappointment! It's boring, uninspiring, and s-l-o-w... You won't recognize or be interested in any of the places they chose to film - through lots of gates, trees, and outside fences and with no people in sight... Lastly, the voice-over sounds like a European woman trying to make a textbook sound sexy while an easy-listening soundtrack plays in the background... Don't waste your money."
1,Don't Judge a Blu-Ray by its Cover,The cover has pictures of Paris and Venice. The cover is the closest the blu-ray comes to showing those two cities. It is an in-depth discussion (other reviews have shown just how boring and lengthy the discussions are) of a few cities. And those cities are not the most significant ones in the two countries. What a disappointment. The only redeeming factor of this blu-ray is that it was cheap.
1,neither beautiful nor really blu-ray,"how does one go about making france and italy boring and bland? well, here's a master class. there's really nothing more to be said than what has already been summed up in the other reviews. boring narrative, uninspired photography and poor video quality were huge disappointments. if you're looking for something to convince you NOT to travel, this is the dvd for you."
2,"Wasn't up to my expectations,","photography not so good.... narrator, not so goodBlu Ray quality .. not so goodDon't bother, if you are looking for quality tour information"
1,Buyers Beware - Misleading dual titles,"While I was pleased with the actual content of the CDs, and feel that I learned a good deal of Spanish beyond the beginners and travelers spanish, I was pretty angry when I realized that Driving Towards Fluency in Spanish 3 was exactly the same content, CD for CD as Behind the Wheel Simple Subjunctive for which I had paid another 50 or so dollars.The quality of the product is very good, but I feel taken, since there was no indication that I was buying the same set of CDs twice, but under different titles. And there was no way to compare the contents before buying. Otherwise I would have given this five stars."
2,Deceptive,"I purchased this book after reading dozens of positive reviews, and being a prepper, figured it would fit nicely with my collection. Unfortunately, this book only goes into heavy weapons, flamethrowers and mines etc, I was hoping it would go into small arms since I've always loved tinkering.Pretty much sums it up for me."
2,In a word,"in a word... eh.Its not quite what it claims to be. The part on breathe of the dragon (flamethrower) is neat, so just by that book and save some money."
3,Photocopy!,I purchased this item new from Amazon. I'm not commenting about the quality of the content but the quality of the print. It seems that the book is literally a photocopy of the original version. the figures have lost the quality. There is no gray shadings it is just black dots!
5,THE COLDEST mARCH,"A well written book is one that keeps you interested to the last page, but even more than that, is one that makes you think. The Coldest March opened new areas of consideration of the purpose and possibilities of exploring unknown areas in this world. More than who got to the Pole first, but how the missions were prepared and executed, and how much past experience, or even the influence of the individuals' home environments, had to do with the planning thereof, was quite interesting and gave more thought to why some succeed and why some fail. Reading this book motivated me to read many more books about the subject of exploration in the polar regions, and introduced me to a new field of study. Regardless of whether the reader agrees or not with the author's conclusions, the reader must agree that the information given from the vast research Soloman obviously did to bring us the facts and the easy to understand the details goes to make a well written book."
3,Last Place on Earth is better!,"Susan Solomon's 400+ pages of closely reasearched and well written material can't disguise Capt. Scott's failings in leadership. He may have possessed a modern scientific outlook in his thinking, but his methodology was so often flawed that his expedition was probably doomed from the start. The PBS companion program ""Secrets of the Dead"" also does a great diservice to Roald Amundsen, characterizing this professional polar explorer's successful journey to the South Pole as ""lucky"" and ""unplanned."" Amundsen's achievement--traversing nearly 2000 miles of unknown territory in the harshest climate on the planet with a mixture of meticulous planning and hearty self-reliance--completely eclipses Scott's slavish & unimaginative repetition of Shackleton's route & methods. Roland Huntford's excellent ""The Last Place on Earth"" remains the classic study of the Amundsen/Scott polar journeys--don't read Solomon without Huntford."
