4,Grizzly,"It'a a great movie for a B movie fan. I agree with the VHS being of better quality than the DVD. The ""State Park in Georgia"" is what you are wondering about it's Black Rock Mountain State Park in Rabun County GA. Same county as the Cult Favorite, ""Deliverance"", as well as the John Denver ""Foxfire"", and the Disney Classic ""The Great Locomotive Chase"". But folks, No Grizzly here, Maybe they should have done a Giant Black Bear. But all in all a great movie for those of us who could do without the matrix stuff in our lives."
2,Not the same,"I havent seen this since i was a kid, Im a little dissapointed, i was hoping that the bear wasnt just some bloke in a suit and its not-its worse... The footage is taken of a bear standing and walking through the woods and is then used again and again throughout the film which is a shame as the film is enjoyable enough."
3,Grizzly-Not all bad.,It may be a bloody movie but it also has some very beautifull scenery and some excellent acting. I do recommend for children to be under adult supervision while watching. It is worth your time to check it out.
3,Grizzlies have attacked,"This film is ok, not on par with the first Jaws. Grizzlies have attacked people. When I was in high school one of my classmates and the friends he was with were tracked by a grizzly throughout the day. Late in the night after they built a large fire when they had all gone to sleep the grizzly came into their camp. All but one person was able to escape. The one who didn't was drag off by the bear and as she was she screamed ""I'm dead! I'm dead!"" They found her patially mutilated body later the following day. This happened in the late sixties in Montana. The film's story did have some basis in reality however it wasn't as suspenseful as the original Jaws."
2,a caution,"The real problem I have with this film is not it's quality or the work that went into it. It's actually better than some movies considered classics, with higher production values than such credible and successful horror movies as ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the original ""Halloween"". The problem is with the threat itself. I live in grizzly country, real grizzly country, where these big bears behave much as they did before the continent was tamed. Grizzlies simply don't act the way they do in this film, and not even disease or injury could change that. A rabid animal will succumb to the disease or fight an opponent it can't beat (there aren't many of those for a grizzly), not engage in the prolonged reign of terror depicted in this movie. A pain maddened bear will go off somewhere and die, not on a rampage. Anyone who sees grizzly should keep in mind that this is fiction. I worry that it would justify murdering bears the way ""Jaws"" has nearly made the great white shark extinct."
2,Hokey and the bear,"""He could be listening to us right now"", Bear expert Scotty tells the ranger. ""Well, if that's the case, maybe we can flush him out."" Not a chance. If the Grizzly's been listening to this grisley dialogue he won't be coming anywhere near. More likely he's expired in the woods with paws and legs outstretched flat as a pancake.I have two Girdler films but I've always steered well clear of this one. Like the Ursus, I should learn to trust my instincts."
2,Better as a kid,"Watched this as a kid and was terrified. Watching it again as an adult and as expected, just a bad bear movie. I didn't purchase it for the crazy prices listed though so I don't mind. Full movie is available for free on YouTube."
3,Interesting movie,"I viewed the Grizzly DVD and it looks just like you would expecta film from the seventies to look. The hairstyles, clothing and theattack effects were quite fascinating and overall an okay movie."
2,Not A Beary Good Film,"Grizzly is about a killer grizzly bear. It's not a beary good film, but it's not completely un-bear-able. The bear attack scenes are beary cool, but all the dialogue in between is beary boring. Also, the music used for the film is beary inappropriate for a horror movie. It beary much sounds like music from Lassie or something like that. Bottom line: Grizzly is a beary average movie."
5,I think that they should have shown the bear more often,This movie was really cool It would have been so awesome if the bear had attacked a Sasquatch and it was pretty cool when the bear cut off the horse's head I was wondering if they made a sequel to this movie?
3,Very convenient but a little hard keep in place.,"If you have a laptop (and this product is intended for that) then it'll suit you perfectly. If you are looking for a gaming pad, then save the trouble and get something else. This mouse pad simply won't stay in place while you move your hand quickly during FPS battle heat. Maybe I'll try using Windex on the adherent surface (as suggested) to clean it and see if it sticks to my furniture's plaidwood. So far not working good here. I'm back with my old thin Dell mouse pad."
3,OK mouse pad,This mouse pad is just okay. In my opinion it is too small and the feel of it is a bit odd.
4,Super fast!,I was looking for a light weight mouse pad to go with my lightweight Toshiba netbook. I had to decrease the mouse speed as it is now super fast.
5,I Pity The Fool Who Don't Buy It!,Its loud enough to hear 20-30' away. My 11 year old son loves it. For around $10 it's worth every penny.
3,"It's cute, not durable though","It definately is good for what we want, friday and saturday night dance party with our 2 year old. However, she picked up hte light and the head fell off. So we now know durablity wise, it's not great - but it definately works well enough for the dance party :)"
4,I have been happy with mine,"For the price, I didn't expect this to be dance hall quality anyway. Agreeing with another reviewer that the light could be brighter, but, I just dropped mine on the floor from a considerable height and it did not break.It *is* a cheap-ie disco ball, but I have been happy with my product. If you are looking for a disco ball that is really powerful, invest more money and buy a bigger one with a brighter light. If you just want a silly party light, this one works for me."
5,Disco fever!,Bought this for my teenage son as decor for his room.. he loved it.. had it running for many many nights
1,..not the book I was expecting....,I saw the spanish version of this book and I bought the english version.......and it was another different book. Nothing to do with one in spanish..........I was really sad...............
3,Deutschland Ueber Alles,"Ok, first off it annoys me to no end that Duisburg is not found in this book at all but 5 cities of equal size with both historical and economic importance are found. Whats more is that there are no real mentionings of how to get around on foot, by bicycle or scooter. Other than that this book is sadly the best one I could find when comparing about 10 or so German Travel Guides at my local bookstores. I plan on writing my own travel tips, guides and more and then submitting them to Lonely Planet."
4,"Good, comprehensive guide, without the photography","Remember, the Kindle versions of these books omit all the photography, so you're left with the maps and the text. In this case, the maps and text are good - comprehensive, informative, up-to-date, and rich in cultural and historical contexts.You'll pay quite a bit more for the print guide, but you'll also get all the nice color material omitted from this file.As an e-book, this guide turns into a purely practical resource. If that's what you're looking for, this is a good choice."
1,not helpful for me,"This book had very little information in that areas of Germany I want to visit. In fact for a country the size of Germany, this book is very small indeed. The Lonely Planet guide to Spain is much larger and has information on nearly every town in Spain worth seeing. There is virtually no or little information on smaller sized towns in this book. For example, there is only 13 pages and four towns exhibited in Eastern Bavaria where I am planning to vacation. That is not enough information given to this area."
5,"When equipped with this book, Germany is like your neighborhood.","This book contains 99.9% you need to travel in Germany and it also tells you where to find the last 0.1%. You cannot leave for Germany without it. Especially, you are the first time be there."
1,"good numbers, awfull concepts","Good maps, good technical information for trains and services... but very poor information on history, on culture, on art. This guide seems to be made for the average vulgar tourist who wants to have an standard-correct-hedonist trip, without caring for deep things. Useful if you need practical information about trains, subways, fees. The rest is nothing."
4,Lonely Planet Germany,"Arrived quickly, and in excellent condition. Would happily purchase again from this seller. The product itself was useful for my needs."
2,Be careful-is this really what you need?,"I travel a lot and compare guides a lot. I have used and enjoyed other Lonely Planet guides for other countries successfully. This one was a real disappointment. It is thorough, but does not really teach you to prioritize your time, or compare routes. It is intensely geared towards rail and bus travelers, but many things in Germany are worth renting a car to see--in which case the book will not cover those areas at all. Hotels chosen by the book will be in relation to train stations--which aren't always either a good deal or a restful place to stay. Add that to the fact it's heavy, and you'll be shlepping a lot of useless information unless you're spending the whole year there..."
3,"Informative, but biased","Overall, I found Lonely Planet's guide more informative and definitely more accurate than Let's Go's. However, I must thoroughly agree with other readers--the book does a severe injustice to Eastern Germany. While Eastern and Western Germany are once again one country, they continue to be very different in many respects. LP judges Eastern Germany with very Western German eyes, not recognizing the fascinating history and culture that lies within this region. Lonely Planet--improve your Eastern Germany section!Also, more information could be included about Germany's various Nature Parks. While they don't rival the National Parks of the states, they are beautiful nonetheless and offer tons of opportunities for exploring."
5,nice adult fantasy!,Mark Ventimiglia's THE BLOODSWORD SAGA VOLIME ONE is fine adventure and quality writing. It is especially pleasing for adults...The characters are believeable if not lovable; the adventure exciting and fulfilling. Serious adult fiction defanitaly NOT for ages 9-12...
2,Not Much Here,"Origionally I bought this book to add to my library of martial arts literature. The flip diagrams were helpful, but the overall quality of the book suffers from a serious lack of expertise. Ms. Beck does not seem to have any credentials from which to teach or write obout this subject. I ended up filing it with the other non-serious and other unfounded martial arts books."
2,Light on useful information,"I wanted this book in order to help me design alien races that would appear scientifically credible in a science-fiction universe. After having read its 220 pages what can I say? All the useful info could take a mere dozen pages.There is lot of advice that could really be summarized like this: 1) be logical and think about the environment before inventing your race's characteristics; 2) read all you can about ethology; 3) Humans are obviously a scientifically credible race, thus in creating humanoid races you cannot be wrong. Ah great! I am glad to have read a whole book to learn just that. Then, here and there are a few tid bits of info really interesting, but in the end most of the text teach you very little on this subject.Overall, I found this book disappointing."
4,Hmm...Interesting,"It's generally considered impossible and absurd to write the perfect book on imagination. That's exactly what ""Aliens and Alien Societies"" is all about. This should not be taken as a book of guidelines on how to use your imagination. It simply gives you scientifically-believable ideas on how to make aliens that you come up with a bit more plausible."
5,Fascinating guide to help any science fiction writer.,"Excellent review of important considerations that every science fiction writer should think about before creating aliens and their societies. The book provides guidelines to ensure the the writer's creations conform to known science and tips on how to ""create"" pausible science to support the science fiction writer's intentions. Included is a biography of fiction and non-fiction to support the author's points and provide the reader with background research"
4,A great book for fans and would be authors.,"The book is not just about aliens and alien societies. It also deals with making proper stars and planets and what alien science might be like. Could of used more details on the subject of planet building, but there are other works that get into the nuts-and-bolts of that subject. This book touches lightly on alien culture, view points and history, not just the science of building an alien creature. Also, some of it might be outdated with our increasing knowledge of other planets and solar systems. It looks more and more like our idea of planet forming and how systems form might be slightly incorrect (if not out right wrong). That is why I held back a star."
4,Aliens and Alien Societies,"Excellent product to springboard thoughts on making an alien race for a novel or roleplaying game. It is written in plain english, and any hard science is explained in laymans terms. I personally used the information here for a space opera RPG, afterwards my players asked me how i made such a believable alien race. This book was worth every penny i paid for it."
2,Over detailed book bogs down writers,"This book, though well writen, has to be one of the worst on the subject of writing. I must say it does go into a great deal of detail, but that is where it stops. The book is long and drawn out- definitely one to put you asleep at night. It goes into far to much detail on creating ""believeable"" species, leaving little to the imagination. This is not a good book if you are into using your imagination while you write"
4,Good but it has its flaws,"This is a nice tuner, it does its job for the most part. The only problem I had with it was the image loss. When I connected xbox to it through the s-video connection, in wreckless the yakuza missions the wheels weren't as shiny as they were on a television. In Dead or Alive 3 when there is fast motion there are these black lines that appear on the characters legs which were not apparent on a television. However, the tv tuner part of it is excellent (which is why most people probably buy it for I'm guessing), it is better than most other internal tv decoder solutions. Despite my small gripe with its video game problem, it is difinately a strong performer, with one of the best tv tuners on the market which gets it a 4 out of 5 from me."
3,Just wanted to say something.,"I do NoT own This... Im sure its good...But, One advantage of the TV tunners that go in your computer and USE your computer To display The TV or whatever On the Computer screen, Is that YOU CAN RECORD VIDEO FILES or take pics of the TV on your computer. Thats one thing I'd want in a TV tunner."
5,really nice unit,"I bought this vga box because I own a front CRT projector (sony 1270) with RGB input. The projector does not have a line doubler built in so when watching tv, even the slightest motion shows the scan lines (you thought the scan lines were bad on a 50"" bigscreen. try looking at them on a 120"" screen!) ...it's a huge improvement for the price. I plan on ordering a second one for my 21"" computer monitor."
1,Quality Control Suspect,0 stars- Unfortunately I was never able to experience the features of this product as I had QC problems with 2 units. The first time the audio out did not work and the second time the box began to burn up and died after about 5 minutes. In those 5 minutes though the picture was great and the sound did work!
4,Good deal,"This product is amazing. I have it paired with a good to high quality 19"" computer monitor. It allows a pass-through so you can use it with your computer when not watching TV. It comes with a remote and some cables. You can also connect a set of speakers and another DVD or VCR to it. My only complaint is that the highest supported resolution is 1024x768. However, the picture is still amazing. The picture quality of televison broadcasts and DVD movies surpases one of my televisons. If you would like a LCD TV but can't afford thousands of dollars. Get this with a good computer monitor. You'll save yourself at least a thousand dollars and get something pretty darn close in picture quality."
1,Bad day for Mike Mainieri's fans,"Beware Mike Mainieri's fans, this DVD contains only 3 tracks of this master vibraphone player, the majority of music material (5 tracks) belongs to less known Richie Cole. While Mike's playing is superb, backed up by great musicians (Eddie Gomez,Bob Mintzer...) I suppose it's not worthed $25 to Mike's fans."
5,Great Googly Mook!,"For all you Whitman Mayo fans out there, this is the DVD to buy!6 episodes of ALL GRADY plus 2 more GRADY appearances! This is Grady at his Finest Waiting for the short lived Grady series to be released on DVD! Go Go Grady!"
4,SANDFORD AND SON IS A CLEVER SHOW,Redd Foxx is one of the best comedians of the 70's and his series Sandford and son is a T.V Classic. Season 3 is one of the best out of the 5 seasons spanning on 3 dvds. Due to contract desputes Redd is missing from certain episodes the show explains Fred is in St. Louis and Witmann Mayo(grady)Stay's in charge of Sanford and Son. Don't be discourge Mayo is a funny character but not near as funny or clever as Foxx. My only complaint is that season 3 DVD does not have subtitles hence my 4 star rating. SO in closing if you wanna laugh you cant go wrong with Sanford. If you dont like it you might get one across your lip you big dummy
2,What is UP with the transfer....?,"I have three, YES THREE red lines about 1 inch thick that runs through (so far) the first 2 eps. Am I the only one...? I returned it once and it still has them, sometimes they are worse than others, but sheesh it is annoying not to mention ugly. Should I try to exchange it at a different store? No other reviewer here mentions this. Of course the comedy is gold but there is just no excuse for this fuzzy red striped mess in the digital age."
5,GRADY IS THE MAN!!!!,This is a good dvd set also I own all three but Grady is in charge of Fred's Castle during most of the season he is good and as funny as Fred and he cracks me up just as good as Redd Foxx does ..... Whitman Mayo was a great actor and comedian. I think that Whitman did a pretty good job filling in for Redd Foxx the show still went on without Redd Foxx and had continued to be successful so hats off to Whitman Mayo!!!!
2,CONTENT EXCELLENT BUT...VIDEO QUALITY EXTREMELY POOR,"I'M SURPRISED ONLY ONE OTHER REVIEW FOR THIS SET MENTIONED THIS PROBLEM AND BOY IS IT A PROBLEM. THERE ARE NUMEROUS EPISODES THAT HAVE HORIZONTAL RED LINES RUNNING ACROSS THE SCREEN. THESE VARY IN INTENSITY FROM A LIGHT SHADE TO A DARKER SHADE BUT THEY ARE ALWAYS VISIBLE AND REALLY DETRACT FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF THE EPISODES IN MY OPINION. THE EPISODES THEMSELVES ARE CLASSIC S & S AND ARE GOOD FOR MANY LAUGHS BUT THERE IS REALLY NO EXCUSE FOR SONY RELEASING THIS SET WITH THE OBVIOUS DEFECTS THAT THESE DISCS HAVE. SONY PROBABLY SAVED A FEW BUCKS AND IN THIER RUSH TO GET THEM OUT THE DOOR JUST SKIPPED QC ALL TOGETHER. IS IT A TRANSFER PROBLEM? A MANUFACTURING DEFECT? WHO KNOWS?...BUT BE AWARE THAT YOU WILL HAVE SERIOUS VIDEO ANOMOLIES WITH THIS SET. IF YOU CAN LIVE WITH THAT, YOU WILL ENJOY THE CONTENT WITH FRED, LAMONT AND THE GANG(MOST NOTABLY ESTHER WHO IS OUTRAGEOUS!) WERE IN THEIR PRIME."
5,"""I Want My Daddy's Records""","This is probably the peak of the Sanford and Son series. Redd Foxx is at his peak and with a strong supporting cast of characters such as Aunt Esther, Grady, Bubba Bexley and the Sanfords' Puerto Rican neighbor Julio.The best episodes are ""The Blind Mellow Jelly Record Collection"", ""Lamont, Is That You?"", ""Fred Sanford, Legal Eagle"", and ""Superflyer.""The ones with Grady as the star sag a little but it still is good."
5,Don't make them like this anymore,I really like it. Love the humor that each story line has.They don't make them like this anymore. We're toopolitically correct now days.
3,This was a Christmas gift.,"I bought this for a Christmas gift. They just don't make decent entertainment anymore. Shows like this prove that you can make an entertaining show without sex, profanity or violence."
1,"Nice design, terrible sound quality","While the look and feel of this walkman is very nice, the sound quality was awful when wearing headphones. If I switched the audio output from ""headphone"" to the alternate feature which allows hooking up the player to a stereo, the sound was great, but then I couldn't work the volume. I will be returning this product and looking around for something better. I had high expectations of this product, and am very disappointed in this Sony product."
5,Critical information for today's world!,"I saw this video in an educational setting and was so impressed I purchased a copy for my children and grandchildren. With fast-paced candor and comfortable humor, Pam Stenzel clearly informs about the realities of sex in today's world and the physical safety, moral strength foundation and mutual respect that abstinence can add to a relationship."
4,My brother likes these shorts,"If you have a man in your family that will not yield to having pleats in his pants, you should consider these shorts. It's fairly difficult to find flat front shorts in a good quality. Typically they make them in the cargo style, which both my brother and husband hate. These are just plain shorts, with normal pockets, and a relaxed fit, which my brother noticed immediately and appreciated, since he has picked up a few pounds. At $8.99, they were a good deal, and the putty color is pretty neutral. The only surprising thing was that Lee Jeans apparently isn't that proud of these shorts because there is no company marking whatsoever on them."
5,guitar learner's inspirational book,"For any Weird Al fan, this is a good start. Has enough variety that the young musician will find a song to get started on. We played Beat It together (piano and Guitar) soon after the book's arrival in our home and it's been a great source of inspiration. The biography on the inside cover is humorous as well. Got it used and was an excellent deal. I'm sure there are newer ones, but Weird Al never goes out of style!"
4,"Great herbal spa recipes, PLEASE WATCH MASSAGE TIP!!!","I found, and still find the information given in this book extremely useful, I use the 'recipes' of this book weekly. However, I was particularly alarmed at the suggestion on page 112 to ""gently push on the spine' - NEVER DO THIS (I'm a trained massage therapist) unless you have proper chiropratic training! I can't BELIEVE this is even suggested!"
5,What an excellent book! I need to own it!!!,"I got this book out of the library, and it was by far the best herbal beauty book I've ever seen... and what a great price!!! I'm buying it so that I can own it and use it forever!! Get it, ladies.... it's a keeper!!!"
5,Just exactly what I have been looking for..!!,"If you are looking for those homemade potions that soften the skin, tighten the pores, or sooth the soul ..this is the book for you.I love this book due to it's simplicity and straight up directions that really work.!I highly recommend."
1,i can't believe this book is getting so much praise,"apparently none of you have sensitive skin, because if you did, you would understand that all those receipes that include the use of alcohol would murder your skin! especially the one for problem skin, my face hurt just reading it! i would also like to add that, for what you would need to put on your skin to kill the bacteria that grew there from all the spoiling FOOD you just had on your skin...it's not worth it. i was quite disappointed with this book, except for the incredibly well known use of cucumber...all you're going to do is damage your skin, upset it's natural balance or give yourself an infection. it sounds really nice, but there are tons of alcohol free, safe herbal products out there that would do a lot better for you."
4,They sound great but can't move too far,I use them with my ipod. I did a lot of research before choosing these headphones. I actually tried three different ones. I like that these have a flexible wire between the earphones and they are comfortable to wear. The only down side is I can't move too far from the transmitter. The sound is great though.
4,Creative Lab Wireless Headphones,"Good product, good sound, some difficulty charging. headphone controls only work with certain devices though. Great product overall"
3,The short life was OK,I loved them for as long as they worked but died in less than a year. :( Still worth it for busy subways and buses. Your player stays safe in your bag while you're listening.
3,meh,"I wasn't too impressed. The sound would cut out every once in awhile even when the device was only 2 feet away. Also, the weight of the headphones pulled on my ears. Every time I took a step I could feel them and after an hour they would really start to hurt. The only positive is that with the adapter I can now order another pair of headphones that will hopefully be a little less painful."
1,Batteries do not charge,"I just purchased these after doing some research on the internet. These seemed like the headphones for me. I just got them last week and I have been trying to charge them. I read through the instruction manual and charged them according to the manual, but they did not behave according to the manual. When they charge, the red light is supposed to stay on until it is fully charged and then it turns blue. For me, it just turns off and then nothing. I have not been able to use them at all. Creative has yet to get back to me on replacing or fixing these. I'm still shocked that they can let something as defective as this out of their warehouses. Creative clearly has problems with quality control."
3,Good but buy better,"The Sony Model D-SJ303 is a capable portable cd player that can hack out music while absorbing shocks. On the down side, it is bulky and weighs more than other cd players. I bought this thinking that the price range would put me into a quality cd player but was disappointed when it had trouble playing HDCD discs. The sound quality was not as good as the Sony D-NF600 cd player that replaced the D-SJ303. Be sure to check out the Sony D-NF600, it produces better sound, weighs less, comes with similar shock absorption features, and has many many more features for just a few bucks more."
2,Not Very Good Quality for the Price,"When I first used this player, it worked fine, but it started to have problems very soon after it was bought for me.The sound quality deteriorated very quickly and the paint started to chip off. Problems it had originally are that it's very bulky, even for a sports player, it doesn't have a pause button (or at least I didn't notice one or one has to do something special to get it to pause) and the sound knob is too easy to turn, so if it bumps into something, suddenly the music is at deafening levels.The Sony D-EJ001 CD Walkman (Blue) was bought for me as a replacement for this player, but it didn't work very well, either."
1,Broken.,"I bought this at a store and it has never worked. Literally I bought it a store,took it out of the box and placed the batteries in the machine and it did not work. Stay away from this product."
2,Not Much Substance Here,"Being a real sucker for merchandising, I loved the packaging for this creativity ""kit,"" a red and black oriental-inspired treasure box. But after tearing off the cellophane with great anticipation, there isn't a lot of substance. The very slender booklet contains mostly blank lines for journaling, each page being adorned with an inspirational quote to get you going. I liked the incense and the little packages of creativity cards that give suggestions for doing things out out of the ordinary (e.g., ""bake a special treat for your pet""). Since I have no pets, though, those suggestion cards will be deep-sixed. This kit is awfully expensive for the slim offerings. One would be better off just buying ""The Artist's Way"" and picking up a package of incense at the local psychic shop."
2,Very disappointing,"I'm a huge sucker for just about anything Julia Cameron does--I have ""The Artist's Way,"" two of her books of prayers & declarations (& a third on the way), two tapes, ""The Vein of Gold,"" etc., etc. & I love these tools. I eagerly snapped up this box but was very disappointed. The little journal could be sold separately--it's a nice volume & a neat idea. The other contents really aren't worth the money & just under half the box is air (there's a cardboard insert to fill up the space). I suspect this was someone's marketing idea & not something that should've been approved, because it's not up to the quality of all that Cameron has done (& her other stuff is very, very good)."
2,Disappointing,"This piece is very unlike Julia Cameron's other creations. The kit doesn't seem to have much substance - a far cry from the Artist's Way. I was very disappointed by this kit, and I would not recommend it to anyone who has already been through The Artist's Way."
3,Better off giving this as a gift with the book,"I was fortunate to get a copy of this kit on sale for $5 at a metaphysical bookstore brand new. The Artist's Way Creativity Kit is very beautiful, complete with a small journal, incense, a circular cards with ideas on what to do for an artist date. That's pretty much the contents. It's simple and a great gift with the book. There really isn't a tool in the kit to help with promoting more creative output."
5,Nice jacket.,I've had this jacket for at least a couple of years now and I am very pleased with the purchase. It hugs in all the right places and it's very warm for a cool day.
3,What's the difference?,"I don't know if you've noticed, but if you search for the Epson-brand replacement color cartridge... It sells for cheaper than this generic Rhinotek! Why? I don't know! They both seem to be rated for the same paper output (around 300 pages of color, probably at %5 coverage) so which is different? Go with the Epson since (right now 9/28/00) it's cheaper.. save a few cents. =) go figure..."
1,Not impressed,This is the second time I have tried 3rd party ink cartridges in my printer. I noticed the difference in output immediately. Colors were washed out and on the blue/greenish hue. When replaced with Epson brand cartridges all was brilliant again.
1,Not for American Designers,"this particular book seems well written, but is only usefull to a designer in the UK. I was hoping for a book that works with LRFD & ASD design aproaches. If you work in America, do not waste your money!"
3,Good idea,"I liked this one right up until the last 40 or so pages. It just kind of fizzels out, unfortunetly. Without spoiling things for those who haven't read it yet, I'll just say that I felt that the author made some promises about resolving some mysteries she sets up in the novel, but sadly many of the most striking and intriguing elements of the mystery mearly dangle unresolved at the rather abrupt ending. However, the idea alone made the whole thing worth while, and the science was understandable and relevant to the plot. I will be on the look out for DiVono's next and I hope it may be a sequel that addresses some of the issues I alude to."
4,This book teaches us that it is okay to define our success,"I think Ms. O""Brien hit the nail right on the head. What it is all about is being able to define what YOU believe is the key to success and to live you life in that way. As long as you live up to your expectations, that is what really counts. At least to me anyway.On another note, I personally met Ginny and she is a fabulous person with extrordinary insight. Her book is not a bunch of mumbo-jumbo, but actual experiences of real people. I would recommend this book for those who question their idea of success. It is very enlightening."
4,Great tea! Cup ok!,"Great teas! I have bought several of the variety packs and have been impressed with the quality of the tea for the price. However, I have also had problems getting the filter to stay in once the water is hot (see reviews for other items with this cup). Filter will stay down when cold water is in it but when the water gets hot in the microwave it floats up and you have to push it down with a spoon for awhile to get it to stay. Or if you boil water on the stove and then pour it in the cup, the filter will not stay in place either. Overall generally happy with the purchase!"
4,Easy Tea brewing,"Practically same product first debuted in Teavana, this tea brewer is quite clever. Put in the tea and add hot water. Let brew for 3 - 5 minutes and dispense the tea by placing on top of a mug. This particular model can be used in the microwave for student or traveler with access to a microwave but no hot pot. Only design flaw is I wish I could take the bottom apart for better scrubbing. Having said that, I own 2 of these and love them."
2,Poor Customer Service,"This tea set was ordered as shown but the pot never arrived. In spite of paying extra to get ""expedited service"" (1 to 3 days promised), the package took eight days to arrive. The company has never responded to any of three e-mails. Be careful."
5,The Best Group in the present.,"After 'Dish of the day' this is the best CD of Fool's Garden. We see, or best I must say, we hear that in this days of commercial music (DJ's, ""punchis-punchis"", etc.) for people with money and little musical appreciation, that it even exists groups making excelent music like this.It's a must in your CD collection."
5,"Very readable, & descriptive of the times in pre-WWII China","Mr. Letcher's letters were written in a style that gives the reader a ""visual"" description of pre World War II China. Although some of his opinions may not be politically correct by todays standards, I think he honestly expresses his feelings of the people and surroundings at the time. Some of his predictions regarding the upcoming war are almost right on--however his prediction that California would eventually be captured by the Japanese happily did not come true. Regardless of Mr. Letcher's personal opinions, his letters are well written and gives the reader the feeling of being there. A good story. The editors did a great job of keeping the story on track, and the footnote information was very informative (Their references led me to several other publications which I subsequently read). The copy I read was from the public library. I plan to buy the book for my collection in the near future."
3,Fair to Meddlin,"Actually we bought the hammock for camping. Our intent was to sleep on it in our tent instead of an air mattress. We really liked the room of the hammock, and being off the floor with ventilation under neith was good. I found that for sleeping it needed to be proped with a couple of blocks to have at the right level. The firmness of the hammock is great for short times but hard on the body over an extended period. We thought when we would not use it for camping it would be good for around the house, but found it to be too bulky. So we nixed the whole thing. It's a good product itself, but not very practical in the long run."
5,the bridge ain't over,"It's a pleasure to hear classic rap like this again, after a year filled with the hot boys. But you can alwaays count on Marley Marl to produce a true gem. peace."
5,The Queens of Mean,"I just saw this movie, and it's now my favorite. The News and Observer(local newspaper) quotes: ""It's the best teen movie since clueless"", and I fully agree. These girls are so mean, you want to scream, but its entertaining and funny as well. It reminds you of the cliques in high school. The cast is funny and extreme, I was laughing til the end. I had read ""Queen Bees and Wannabees"", the book the movie pulled ideas out of, and i noticed similar ideas and/or quotes, but it wasn't based on it, which I enjoyed. In a way, you want to have the power of a Mean Girl, but the genuine personality of Cady, which makes you love and hate the the mean girls (especially their leader, Regina) all at once. This movie shows the consequences of being mean in a funny, entertaining and realistic way."
4,Okay i guess...,"I think this movie is Ok but the fact that 5 year olds were watching it was a little disturbing... I mean, isn't it a little explicit for little kids??? But for all those teens out there, I think this movie rox my sox and will rock ur sox too!!! I love how it really portrays teen life and its complexity. (...)"
4,"Finally, a good teen flick for everybody.","Thoese of us who have survived high school and those who are still in it, can really relate to this film. It is not masterpiece theater, but it is definately smarter and more clever than its predecessors. It doesn't single out a group of socialites, and it is't entirely about the chess club, it is about the entire high school population. It really breaks high school down scientifically, which is kind of overdone at times, but hey it is a comedy movie. Lindsay Lohan shines in another movie again. (...)Like I said it isn't Gone with the Wind, but it will dfinately go down in teen movie history."
3,Get MEAN,"MEAN GIRLS amounts, mostly, to a bout of guilty pleasure: four great looking high school girls -- their cliche called 'The Plastics' -- have it all: they're beautiful, they're beautiful, and ... well ... they're beautiful. Beyond that, only Lindsay Lohan has any real brains, but -- in the way that only a misguided high school beauty can -- she loses track of her way and has to find it again before the two hours of screen time is over.The script is witty but could've used a bit of polish. Oddly enough, I found myself wanting to see more of Tim Meadows school principal (wonderfully deadpan) and Tina Fey's nerdy math teacher. Had the film given us more of the heartwarming moments packed into the last twenty minutes, it would've been a far more interesting and rewarding experience.Again, not a bad film, and, if it were possible, I'd give it 3.5 stars out of 5.0. Lindsay is a talented young actress coming into her own, and it will be terrific to see where she ends up after all is said and done!"
4,Mean is Good,"The movie Mean Girls was a lot better than I expected it to be. I expected it to be some little kids movie, but it was not. At all. It is like the antichrist of kids movies.The movie is incredibly dark and adult humored and totally threw off my expectations. Tina Fey's sharp writing showcases her talents very well. That comedianne had much more in her than i knew, and i liked that. If Fey continues to write like this, i think she will get very far in hollywood and out of the 5 minute span of her Saturday Night Live skits.The 4 mean girls of the movie are well played. Lindsey Lohan continues with her string of successes in film once again. This movie only showcases her talent even more and shows that she can get out of the kid's movie genre. And, the main mean girl (i don't know her name) is quite the mean girl and she is awesome in showing that. The other 2 girls are perfect in their supporting roles are ditzy followers.This dark little movie is weird, but very enjoyable."
2,"""Mean Girls"" is for Tween Girls despite the SNL casting","Dont get me wrong, I think Tina Fey is great. But am I the only one who finds her shallow 'moral of the story' in the movie, ""Making fun of other people will get you nowhere"", a little hypocritical, since she makes fun of people for a living? Im making too much out of a crappy teen girl movie.Basically, everyone in the film is stereotypical right down to the makeup. And the gay guy is too gay. and the ""rebel"" girl seems psychotic more then 'different'. and nothing about lindsay lohan makes me think ""Nice Girl"". She looks like a diva to me. Even with her boyish good looks.read my other opinions and leave some of your own on www.xanga.com/bogdana"
5,This is A MOVIE!! NOT A BORE!!!,This movie is a reality movie. It tells you about what its like in middle school and what is coming up. This movie had some curses that were used in a good way. But then after using them they were excelled with a punishment. So the children will learn that if you do that they will be punsihed. Though it is not good to curse but to act an appropriate scene is wonderful. This is a great movie! ~*Marissa*~
3,Mean Girls or Dumb Girls?,"After watching this movie not only was it different, but I found it to be quite funny. Everyone could relate to this movie from high school. I enjoyed the movie until close to the end when the bus accident occurred. That should have been left out and I also things so other little things should have been changed. But overall, it was a good movie with a twistng end."
3,Looks Funny!,I'm glad there is a movie for teens that is different then the whole i'm not-popular-popular girl-is mean cliche. Looks funny hope Lindsay wows us again!
1,Used to be a Lindsay Lohan fan,"I thought that Lindsay Lohan didn't star in movies like this. I am very disappointed. I used to be a fan of hers when I saw her in the Parent Trap movie. I've seen previews for the movie and it doesn't look good. Who would want to sit and watch an hour and a half of fighting? Go to www.screenit.com before you see a movie. There you will learn if it is acceptable for kids to see. If we don't go to see this movie then we will show the movie producers that we don't want this kind of movie and they will start making better movies. Don't go see New York Minute, either. That is a disappoint. However, if you are wanting to see a good, clean and funny movie go see Cheaper by the Dozen or the Lizzie Mcguire Movie."
1,Save your money,"My whole family saw this movie in a prescreening on Thursday, 4/22. We left totally disappointed. Why a homeschooled young adult would want to go to a public school is a ridiculous notion. My wife and I have been homeschooling all of our 5 children for the last 10 years. All of my homeschooled children disliked the movie and thought it was unrealistic, vulgar, and wished that we walked out after the first 10 minutes. Lohan plays Katy, the main character, who's socially stupid for a homeschooler. Academically she is outstanding, but has to downplay her intelligence to try and win the attention of a boy and associates herself with Plastic girls. She isn't honest with herself and painfully learns her lesson to be herself and to tell the truth. Save your money."
2,Started off great,"I love mean girls, and i was thrilled to find out that it was paired with clueless. I bought the dvd less than a month ago and it is already not working."
5,Given to God delivers,"This is one of the most interesting books of its kind that I've read in quite a while. ""Given to God..."" delivers a brilliant mix of historical fact and fiction. The author brings the characters to life in a manner that helps you quickly take interest, with a continuity to hold that interest through to the last chapter. The style of writing made it easy for me to visualize the surroundings and experience what the characters experienced; which is very important to me. Be prepared for a stimulating tug at your emotions, and some interesting surprises. You will not be disappointed."
3,Some awesome standout tracks..,"Like the title says this cd has some awesome tracks that really deserves a listen, however the quality this release is somewhat mixed since a lot of the songs are mediocre 80s rock tunes. I`d say this band reminds me a little of bands like XYZ, Dokken a.o. The last song on this record, Subway Train, is absolutely the best piece of catchy R&R I`ve heard in quite a long time, other great tracks include ""All Fired Up"", ""Moneys Tough"", ""holding Out On Love"" and of course ""Subway Train"""
2,"Works, but not for the PS3.","I purchased this adapter hoping to read xD cards from my wife's camera in our Playstation 3. It did not work. The adapter itself functions, but not for the purpose for which I needed it."
4,Dresser,"The dresser is very nice, but the top drawers rub against each other if open at the same time, otherwise it is very nice and was fairly simple to put together."
1,manufacturer's flaw,"The 7-drawer dresser I purchased has a manufacturer's flaw, which means the four top drawers do not square. It makes opening the drawers below difficult, but MORE IMPORTANTLY it makes the piece look like a cheap piece of junk, because the drawers angle inward. (The center vertical piece is about 0.25 inches too short, which is why the drawers dip towards the center.)"
2,"*Still* not white, Amazon/DaVinci!","Thinking that Amazon or DaVinci would have corrected their color labeling mistake by now (see previous reviewer's comment about the ""white"" dresser), we ordered this dresser for our nursery. As soon as the 100+ lb box arrived, I knew we'd be sending it back. The box was labeled 'Antique White', as a previous reviewer noted (months ago). I did open the box to compare the color of the dresser to the other white furniture we have in the nursery. Not even close. I can't comment on the quality of the dresser itself, as I made no effort to assemble it."
3,"nice dresser, wrong color",i love the actual dresser but returned it because it is antique white and i needed white.
1,"""THIS RIDE GOES NOWHERE""","THE LATE PAUL BUTTERFIELD WAS A GREAT FRONT MAN WITH MANY FINE MUSICIANS BUT HIS BEST WORK WAS WAY BEHIND HIM WITH THIS POOR RELEASE.I THINK THE IDEA WAS TO PULL PAUL BUTTERFIELD INTO A COMMERCIAL AREA AND ONLY ONE BLUES PIECE,A SAD VERSION OF MANNISH BOY,IS PRESENTED ON THIS C.D.SADLY THIS WAS ONE OF PAUL BUTTERFIELD'S LAST EFFORTS AND IT DROPPED INTO THE DELETE BIN FASTER THAN ONE OF HIS TRADEMARK HARP SOLO'S....WHY IT WAS RELEASED ON C.D FORMAT IS BEYOND ME???"
1,where's butterfield?,bought this on used vinyl several years ago for a couple bucks. don't waste your money. butterrfield's presence on this album is very minimal. i think they just paid him to use his name.
4,Pretty good - could grip a little better,"These push blocks do what they're supposed to - keep my fingers away from the jointer knives. I like the angled handles. They don't grab the wood quite as well as I'd like, though, sometimes forcing me to apply more pressure that I want to, which can sometimes interfere with correct jointing technique."
5,Closing Doors Hurts Others,"Days after watching this film, I still think about it. It is a pleasant little story that takes us someplace unexpected. It isn't about a Jewish family that was wronged by others during WW2 (although they certainly were). It is about a Jewish family that wronged others after the war. The wrong that they perpetrated was simply one of isolating themselves, of setting themselves apart, of closing the door on others, of not saying ""Thank You"".Well, that door is opened 50 years later. And the world is a better place because of it. It was such an honor to see this warm, gentle film."
4,Documentaries don't usually make you cry!,"Documentaries usually are designed to make you think. This one makes you think AND feel. It starts with the protagonist, Menachem Daum lamenting that religion in general is in danger of being taken over by hate-filled extremists. We find that Daum's two sons are Yeshiva students who have no particular desire to associate with those who aren't Jewish.`Perhaps, through their grandfather, perhaps, through their studies, they've developed the mindset that non-Jews are basically dangerous and that it's best to erect a barrier between them. This is a journey as father reunites his children with the Polish couple who risked their lives to save the children's grandfather and uncles.The story drags in part, but press on. The end more than accommodates the lack of professional editing, and it has a few life lessons."
4,"Relaxing, fun and a good challenge :-D","Keli Roberts is one of the best instructors. She's brought us another great workout. It's kind of unique because of the foam roller. It massages almost all of your muscles (and some you didn't know you had) and it's very relaxing. As you get rid of your knots, you are also becoming a little more flexible as it's great for helping you to improve your range of motion. You can adjust the roller's position to get a deep tissue massage or gentle relaxation.In this you'll work your abs and total core and feel really good afterwards. It is about 30 minutes and so it's perfect for using at the end of a stressful day. I'm loving mine and it will make a great treat for yourself or a friend because almost everyone can do this routine."
3,"good exercises, poor editing","I've used a roller for years at the suggestion of a physical therapist so I'm used to moving around on a roller. Keli's choice of exercises is great, she covers a lot of areas that can get really tense. The part that bothered me was the editing of the video. The warm-up was less than a minute and only covered the hips then ended abruptly. The other workouts were just exerpts from a video she shot and when played separately, they begin and end abruptly. No introductions, warmups or conclusions. Overall, the exercises are good but it's best to play all of them to get the full effect."
5,Excellent book,I first read this book in high school (1968) this past month i reread it. It is still a powerful voice on responsible consumerism. The pedacabs are now real. I have a rhodescar quad cycle. I strongly recommend this book.
4,1950s social satire,"Welcome to the 23rd century USA. The government is in thrall to business, spaceships are named after David Ricardo, corporate advertising is all-pervasive, coffee is either highly addictive or illegal, and eco-terrorists battle corporations. How prophetic!"
1,Ridiculous,"If you liked Monty Python's..., ""I used to have to work 26 hours a day paying the mill master 20 dollars a day for permission to work and live in a cardboard box in the middle of the road...""... then you'll like this."
3,"OK, but not good for usb wireless equipped PCs","This hub worked ok on my older computer and my laptop and did the job fine. I just got a new HP that advertised wireless b/g capability. The wireless connection was working fine until I plugged in this hub, then the computer dropped the connection and kept telling me I didn't have a wireless device installed. It took me a while to figure out that the wifi device was USB powered (although internal to the desktop's box). After I found that out I disconnected all USB devices. By a process of elimination I found that it was this hub causing the problem. Now, this may be a factor of the wireless device and have nothing to do with this usb hub, but it's something to think about before buying one of these if your desktop is using a usb wifi device (and you want that to function properly). Other than that, no complaints with the hub... like I said, it worked great on my computers not using wifi."
3,NO GOOD PACKING,"I JUST RECEIDED THIS ITEM TODAY. I ALREADY CONNECT IT AND LOOK LIKE WORKS GOOD FOR THE MOMENT. I DIDN'T LIKE THE PACKING. SEEMS LIKE THE ITEM ISN'T NEW. IS NOT OPEN BOX, IS A DESTROYED BOX."
4,Smart Dog,This book is great! I really enjoyed reading it. I liked the part when Sherlock said he was on the computer.That really amazed me in the book because dogs don't know how to use a computer. I also liked this book because the science teacher and the kids were going to dissect his brain! I also likedthe part when Sherlock was jumping up in the window at the school and got all the kids to start laughing.
4,Amusing canine fantasy,"Sherlock is a dog who has escaped from a university lab where gene splicing and neuron stimulation have made him intelligent and able to talk. Fifth-grader Amy and her friends find that keeping the dog's identity secret from grown-ups results in all sorts of unforeseen and hilarious complications. ""Smart Dog"" doesn't quite measure up to Ms. Vande Velde's best (""A Hidden Magic,"" for example), but still I found it an enjoyable read: Sherlock and his rescuers are likable characters, the school bully gets her comeuppance, and all ends happily. If you like humorous dog stories, you might also want to read Peter Dickinson's ""Chuck and Danielle."""
2,What the Heck !!!,This book came in with every library stamp / sticker / code on it along with a 'This book belongs to the Blankety Blank Library'....What the Heck......???? Dont buy a book from this seller unless you want one that belongs to a library with all the library tags/stamps/etc.
4,"Nice pictures of how machines work, good recommendations","I am an incipient woodworking amateur and as such the value of this book is in the tutorial and recommendation aspects. I liked a little better the Ortho book (all about power tools) as it does a better job of describing practical tool applications.Despite the previous comment, I did like this one."
2,ASHAMED TO PURCHASE THIS BAG,"Fendi had made good looking watches, simple and timeless.What they have done to handbags is disgraceful !Italians (in Italy) do not buy this rubbish.It's trashiness and Designer label appeals to mostly adolescents and young women with poor qualifications to inspect for detail , quality and aesthetic appeal.The fakes they sell are as ugly as the asronomically expensive ones that are authentic.authentic sappy imports."
2,not leather,I liked this bag.My mom boght it for herself but it doesnt smell like real leather I think its phoney and not soft really stiff.
1,Not as described/pictured,"These fit badly like they are warped. There are also no nose pads, just curled up pieces of wire and no pad or support to keep them on."
5,Great sunglasses for my NEO costume,"I have a NEO coat that I usually wear on Halloween, and I'm always looking for NEO sunglasses to compliment it. I have to say these are the best I have come across for the price, and the look is PERFECT -- these are more like the Matrix Revolutions style. I am Matrix Geek LOL.Very happy with them. won't wear them every day, but definitely enough to get my use out of them."
2,"To fragile, broke easily","These glasses where very fashional but yet broke easley ,sorry because I really liked them , should be more durable , not a bang for the buck, loss of money, sorry to say so, the shipping was ok..."
1,bad,"i received the glasses , but i am sorry the quality is too bad , and its better for me if it was more expensive with quality better than this , thanks"
3,"Good for the price, but odd customer service.","For the price, roughly $10, I like these sunglasses. They are easy to fit and do a good job of blocking sunlight. I've actually ordered two more because I like them. Two problems in my experience tho...1) The nose pads on my initial pair were brittle. I was trying to adjust the nose fit when one of them snapped off into my hand. On the bright side I found that several companies sell sets of 20 or more replacement nose pads for less than $5.2) I told the seller about this problem before posting any feedback, as they requested. They thanked me for notifying them of the problem. They asked me for more information and offered a discount on my next purchase. I sent them more information. They replied that, because I purchased through Amazon they couldn't provide any kind of discount and thanked me for buying their product.I've knocked a star off this review because they offered something and then refused it, and another star because of the faulty nose pads."
4,"A kinder, gentler Halloween with style","Kasey Rogers has brought us a kinder, gentler Halloween. Although I think this one fell somewhat short of her first Halloween crafts book, there are still some great ideas and A LOT of inspiration in this book. Again, Halloween is the eerily elegant holiday she presented in her first book and enough to single out this book in the bulk of Halloween crafts and decorating books. Also worth note are 10 or so odd vintage images at the back of the book that you can use for her projects or your own."
4,"Almost too cute, but still worth a look","I *loved* the first book from Kasey & Mark,Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Decor, and always knew that I'd be getting this book to add to my collection. It's important to note that the title says ""Fall-o-ween,"" and not to expect a full-on Halloween book. Many of the projects are too cute for my taste, but I'm pleased to have this in my collection all the same, because of the spirit behind it. Kasey loved the holiday and it really shows. Even if I can't use many of the ideas straight out of the book, I can take inspiration from them."
3,Does the job,It does what it states. It hands the Zoomed 501 filter on the back or side of an aquarium. It is easy to install and seems to hold it up fairly well. The main thing lacking is the quality of the plastic. I am not sure I would trust it in the long run. It feel like I could bump into it and it would break and make a mess everywhere. Though if mounted in the right location it should not be an issue.
3,good sound but cd player didn['t last,We loved this boombox but after a few trips with it the cd player stopped working. Starting getting the no disc message. That was very disappointing.
5,WONDERFUL MACHINE,I PAID $80.00 FOR MINE. WE USE IT ALL THE TIME. GREAT QUALITY AND SOUND. FOR SOME REASON THE PRICE WENT WAY UP AND YOU CAN'T FIND THEM FOR SALE. IPOD COMPATABLES SEEM TO BE FORCED ON US. LOTS OF US JUST WANT TO PLAY OUR CD'S. WHAT IS GOING ON. LETS RAISE OUR VOICES AND TELL THEM WHAT WE WANT.
2,Disappointed,"Bought this so I could carry it around the house with me. However, the CD player's anti-motion mechanism shut it off extremely easily, although sound quality was excellent when it was playing. I returned it as a defective item, and although I bought it direct from SonyStyle, they had great bureaucratic problems having the unit picked up and a replacement sent to me - so I had no choice but to return it and shop for another brand, loyal Sony customer that I had been. The offshore service representative gave awful service."
4,Not A Bad Buy!,"Probably the best boombox I have ever owned. Has great sound for such small speakers, although I wished it had just a bit more bass...Then it would be perfect.A great buy nonetheless and a great price too."
2,Not as nice as I had hoped.,"I decided to buy a sony CD player for our family Room. When it arrived, it was larger than I had expected. The sounds quality is mediocre at best, which is not what I had expected from a sony product. Not a good deal for the price."
4,Great product for the money!,"I utilize this Sony ZS-X10 on my deck while basking outside on nice sunny days and cool evenings. I use it a lot for playing my collectionof early 50's to mid 60's doo-wop recordings, which I have painstakinglyconverted from analog vinyl to digital compact disc. Over 750 original tracks taken from both 45rpm and LP formats. The sound is quite good for a device this inexpensive. No, it doesn't meet audiophile standards but I've never heard a home portable sound system that does. It looks sharp, is easy to operate and with ""megabase"" in operation sounds better than units costing much more. The only thing that would make it a perfect buy is the addition of a remote control. Commercial CD's sound very good andthe FM/AM radio pulls in strong and weaker signals without hiss or noise.A great boom-box, for the minor investment, as a gift or for yourself."
2,I suppose there is a reason it was never republished after 1810,"I had to do a research project on this book. It was very dull in sense of fiction writing technique, but very interesting when looking at the perspective of the time it was written. It is very Romanticized and fantastical. The main character fights a bear, finds Native American Egyptian Mummies (WTF, I know?) and saves himself from doom with his years of practice in ventroloquism.An interesting read if your looking to see something strange from a time period so different from our own."
1,MISLEADING Ad Quantity/Price,"The Ad states: Dyna Stopper Trauma Dresssing, Ster-60 Per CaseList Price: $130.59 (price is lined thru)Price: $1.58You Save: $128.99 (99%)I ordered and received one package! ONE !! The Shipping was $2.41 whichis MORE than the product! I thought they were having a clearance or maybeoutdated supplies so I ordered it to put in my Doomsday Supplies cubard.A month later I went back to look at the Ad and they have changed it to:List Price: $15.00Price: $1.58You Save: $13.42 (89%)I assume they read my Review about their product. Very disappointed. I'll shop at Wal-Mart next time. NO supprises there.I did purchase this item at Amazon but it came from: BP MEDICAL SUPPLIESDyna Stopper Trauma Dressing, Ster - 60 Per Case."
4,Interesting read...,"This dark collection of stories was very interesting. Take a nightmare, and imagine it being warped, twisted, and then shown to you in print. John Shirley had one or two stories in there that I've read again, simply because they were so powerful. Others, I read, and promptly flushed from my memory banks... If you're looking for spooky, violent and fairly sexually themed stories, this is good. If you're easily offended, or have a weak stomach, skip this..."
3,There's only so much one can take,"About: Collection of horror short storiesPros: Lots of blood, gore and sexCons: One can only stand so much blood, gore and sexGrade: B-"
5,Salt Desert Tales of Genius,"""Great God Pan - Salt Desert Tales"" sandblasts off layers of smog and grime that have been clotting up the West for the past hundred years. This is a history that has been abandoned or neglected, and when one delves into these tales a clear appreciation of this idiosyncratic region takes hold. These stories are not mere anecdotal tales, but stories with unlikely heroes, impossible eccentrics, and visionary madmen. The best part is that all of this is true. The writers of this book have gone to considerable lengths to find histories of the West that step outside of the traditional homage to the individualist, Western Expansionist prototype."
1,"Shallow, Not Subtle--Simply Awful.","I'm amazed at the number of reviews I've read here that descibe the ""witty dialogue"" in this film, or that describe it as a ""representative piece"" for the 1980s. Good Lord, I sat through this film last night, and it was the most vapid movie I've seen in quite awhile. I waited--in vain--for the dialogue to become witty and insightful. I generally love films with a lot of dialogue, but this was a ""talky"" film that had very, very little to say. I began to think that the point was, perhaps, that these characters were so shallow that they had nothing of note to communicate to one another. If that's the case, this could have been done with more style and with some semblance of a plot or character development. The actors sound like they're trapped in a bad high school play--indeed, I think I've seen high school and community theatre productions that were more engaging than this pretentious waste of film stock."
2,Should come with a dictionary!,"For those that lived the era of the Megadiscos this movie is silly! The story line is entertaining yet sometimes hard to follow with all the names being tossed around with $12 words. Imagine a writer who writes about something he has only heard about yet never experienced and you get the feel of the movie. Music that spreads a gap of about 10 years for a club scene set in the early 80's. Dress that also is reminiscent of 1970's but also of 1990's? (What's with the Tommy Hilfiger ""rapper""head bandana on the ONE gay couple? )One profound statement exists in the film however, how some will look back on a very influential era and only see John Travolta with his finger in the air in a polyester suit, hedonistic values and widespread drug use. Ah..memories......."
2,Moves slowly at first... ok ...but not quite as good as the sexy cover shot!,The best part about the movie is the cover. Kate Beckinsale looks grrrreat! Chloe can act as well. I first reviewed this film and trashed it after watching the first 1/2-3/4 but then went back and finished it and surprisingly enjoyed the rest of it. Ok but worth $150 because it's out of print? No way.
3,I love the disco.....I love the disco......,"I saw this movie a couple of times and was impressed in a few ways. The script was very witty and creative;the disco music was a pleasant respite from the BEE GEES and K.C. & the Sunshine Band. Also I couldn't keep my eyes off of Chloe Sevigny. She was mesmerizing. This movie was on a par with METROPOLITAN and much better than BARCELONA. On the other hand, does anybody really think these people live in N.Y. I lived in N.Y. and real New Yorkers would kill these people. O well it's a parody and just a movie. But enjoyable."
1,Dull!,"Was totally surprised that this film got any good press whatsoever! The acting is not as good as that you'd see in a high school play--lustreless, wooden--the scene is nothing like a real disco--it's clean, roomy and not thick with smoke. Discos--even the best, at there best, were crowded, smokey, and filled with debauchery, music so loud you had to scream to be heard, and drugs everywhere. This is inaccurate as well as boring."
1,Absolute pants. Avoid this movie like the plague.,"Surely the most overrated movie of all time. I had heard rave reviews about Last Days of Disco, and was eager to watch it. I saw it as part of a school trip and was bored within the first ten minutes. More interesting than the film was the competition Alex and I had trying to hide under chairs! (Yes, we were that bored.) We couldn't wait for the film to end. Our feelings were shared with the other fifty or so students on the trip, and all the teachers! If you watch this you must really want to waste your money."
1,Stupid and self-indelgent,I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. I was expecting some good music and interest circumstance...but instead I encountered some lousy acting and some people I absolutely disliked.
1,I had to turn it off after an hour,"I had to turn off this yawn-fest after an hour due to the poor acting, the hollow pseudo-intellectualisms, and the barely-nonexistent plot."
1,Simply Horrible,This has to be the worst movie that I have ever witnessed in my 28 years on Earth. It was simply horrible and I would rather eat the $20 plus that I spent on buying it.
3,CHLOELIOUS!,"'The Last Days Of Disco' is a fun film. But what makes me want to own this film is the always mesmerisng/interesting,striking/fun and the delightful Chloe Sevigny. She always has a presence and life that I havn't really seen before. She is one of the best actors around. She just seals the deal-getting to watch Chloe for one hour and fifty five minutes."
3,Not Whit Stillman's best,"If you want to truly appreciate writer-director Whit Stillman's work, buy 'Metropolitan' or 'Barcelona.' (Regrettably, neither is yet on DVD.) 'Last Days of Disco' does have some of the clever dialog and observation as those other films, but it suffers from some anonymous and uninspired acting including Chloe Sevingny's strange wooden style and male characters who all look and act alike. Chris Eigeman, who is SO great in the other two films, is sort of miscast here."
2,"Run away. Run far, far away.","Being a writer myself, I can appreciate the talkie movie. Your Friends and Neighbors is a perfect exampe of a talkie movie that works. The Last Days of Disco is not. The dialogue isn't very witty, the subject matter is boring, the characters lack any flare, and plot is merely a structure to hold together countless uninspired conversations. Watch Barcelona or Metropolitan, much better films. Leave this one alone."
2,"Some good moments in a dull, overlong film.","The night life/love life of a group of Manhattan yuppies in the ""early 1980s.""See them whining at work! Hear them whining about their love lives! Feel their pain as they whine about the lack of affordable housing in Manhattan!Some clever but shallow dialogue. Some minor but unoriginal insights.Slick production values. The scenes accurately recreate early 1980s Manhattan (when I worked there).But the dialogue and characters are so unbearably shallow, it's not worth wading through the film's nearly 2 hours for those few good moments."
3,Where is Metroploitan,Why is it that Whit Stillman's best work is still not available on DVD. Will the appropriate people please remove their heads from their arses.
4,Fantastic Dialogue,"If you enjoy well-written, intelligent wit, then you'll love The Last Days of Disco. Full of sharp, enjoyable dialogue, The Last Days of Disco tells the story of three roommates and their relationships in and around the club scene of New York in the waning days of the disco era. As others have stated, Chloe Sevigny is stunning in the lead role. This definitely isn't for the Dumb and Dumber crowd, but if you enjoy having your mind tickled as well as your funnybone, then you'll enjoy the Last Days of Disco."
4,Yoshi,"It's a good plushie, but it has a small tear on it. A good addition to your Mario Bros collection."
2,Smaller than described,"This toy was much smaller than it was described. It was closer to the size of a beanie bear. It was a gift, so we just added to the gift and he seemed to like it. I was disappointed in the size vs cost."
4,yeah yoshi,"Great stuffed animal for the price. It is bigger and more durable then what we thought it would be, perfect for the young child in love with yoshi!"
1,Yoshi,"My son loves the toy , but it is a pain in the neck, it rips. I had fixed it several times. If my son did not love it i would put it in the garbage"
4,Happy son,My son wanted some stuffed Mario characters for Christmas. This was great. He has slept with it every night since; it seems to be constructed very well. I was happy with shipping time as well.
3,Sewing,I had to sew this product back up at least 3 times already. The construction is poor and it keeps opening up at the seams. Luckily I can sew and I am able to fix it.
4,Yoshi plush is pretty cute,"I'm a guy and even I think this Yoshi is quite cute. I bought this for my girlfriend as a present because she loves Yoshi from the Mario series. The plush is a great size, not too large or too small. One of the strings on the hand came off only a few weeks after getting it, but it was very minor and everything else seems to be pretty durable for the most part, even though we've only had it for a little over a month.I recommend this to any person who loves either Plushies or Yoshi (or both)."
5,Yoshi animal,"Our son LOVES his new Yoshi, he said it was the best birthday present he has ever gotten. He is soft and cuddle and perfect for playing and sleeping with. Haven't had to wash him yet so can't tell you how durable he is but he has given our son hours of fun."
5,dance kids dance!,billy jonas rocks! dance sing and beat on a water drum!songs you will sing for years to come! we got his CD by mistake in a rafi case and were SO EXCITED for the mix-up! super good tribal fun!!
1,Not happy with the product,"I bought two of these ink cartridges for my Epson Stylus 660 printer. Last week I replaced my empty Epson cartridge with a Rhinotek. I was very disappointed in the quality of the ink. It is very inconsistent. Sometimes it prints fine, while other pages are terrible. I will spend the extra and stick with Epson cartridges in the future."
3,In the Pink,"This is a bawdy, fun but oddly directed live concert featuring the always enjoyable and creative Pink. The spontaneous and quirky Pink and her amazing voice are overshadowed by bad editing, sloppy sound and a stunning example of censorship in an unrated dvd! There are numerous examples of Pink's showmanship and command of her audience and some incredible vocals, the Janis Joplin tribute is worth the price but should have been longer. The only song that is tough to get through is the goofy version of Lady Marmalade which for some reason involves choppy singing sections and cabaret with blow up dolls. This spectacle takes away from Pink's singing and becomes an unintended parody. If you can get through the bad editing and sound this is an entertaining ride through a tour in the life of one of pop/rock's great singers."
2,"Good Music, but very explicit.","I have been a huge P!nk fan for years, and I have never seen her like this. During the performance of ""God is a DJ"", ""Oh My God"", and ""Trouble"" P!nk and her back-up dancers are heavily pole-dancing, and the back-up dancers are wearing nothing but thongs and small patches over their nipples. I ended-up throwing my copy away, because the sexual content is just WAY too strong. But, if you don't mind all of the filth, her performances are very good, she has a gorgeous voice, and her performing is awesome. It was simply too much for me to handle."
1,unwatchable and unlistenable,"not worth the free shipping I spent on this, it seems like a mean unfun,not happy sort of concert and dvd singing is bad,lyrics bad, dancing poor If you want good Female/dance sort of dvd with some joy in it buy the new Gwen Stefane dvd"
5,From Europe to my living room,"It was unfortunate to learn that Pink's third tour was not making it to my city but I love the fact that I can now feel as though I was there with this DVD. Not only did she perform her new tracks from the third CD but she did plenty of songs from her previous albums as well as some awesome covers that I've never heard before. Also, the performances, choreography and set was the most creative I've seen from her!"
4,VERY GOOD.....,Don't really understand why the explicit label. I guess it is the language and the nipple piercing she has done while her mother is watching. OUCH! The concert is very good and the music is great plus all the extras. The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is the camera work. It seems that it is very jumpy. I mean it never stays focused on her. Other than thatit is very good..
2,Director is clueless,"Apparently the director mistook shooting and editing a concert for shooting and editing a music video, and thus we are treated to endless jump cuts and focus changes, completely losing the concert experience. Beyond annoying. I ripped the audio from the DVD and spent much of an hour editing down to 22 songs."
2,just ok&a so-so re-thread,"this is basically ""Blow your Mind"" Part two.Eve is the Guest Rapper who already did this song with Gwen Stefani already. this time around with Mary J.Bliege it seems calculated by the Numbers type of track."
5,MagiCactus.com,This has to be the best book wrtten on the cultural background and use of this amazing little plant. Explains in depth the variations between cerimonies depending on the tribe. I only wish Anderson put as much effort into his studies of this plant so taht his information wouldn't be so lagging and incorrect when describing the species. Learn more about this little plant at MagiCactus dot com.Happy Growing
5,Best So Far,"Over the past week or so, I read or skimmed a bunch of books on Peyote. This one was the best. It covers a wide range of issues: from user's experiences to history to plant attributes and qualities. Peyote is an amazing plant. In fact, as you read more, it's hard not to think of it as a divine plant (well, I suppose all plants and beings have spirit, at least from a peyoteist perspective, but this one is especially soulful). It's very worthy of further study. The only downside to this book, is (as one would expect from a university press) a bit on the academic side. Some of it is a bit on the dry side; still the best book on the topic I came across. So anyone interested in peyote should start here."
4,Amazing 1959 sound!,"The sound quality is pretty amazing considering the recording was made in 1959, but then, Vanguard always had a real sharpness even on their old LPs. This recording was long considered one of the chamber classics from the old era, when they simply performed the music to the best of their ability (and extraordinary ability at that!) and let the listener make of it what they will. Serious Mozart (and the string quintets are the most serious) deserves careful listening, and these performances deliver."
5,Grab it now !,"I constantly go back to it for ideas and ""how-to"" tips. Keep it in the bathroom, and consult it often. Very helpful and easy to understand, generally ! When will the illustrations used in these self-help books improve ? My biggest complaint because they are so hard to see or not obivious !Ron Mitchell, Indpls,IN"
3,"Not a back book, but....","To be fair, I have not really spent much time with this book. I bought it mostly because I thought it was really going to take me to the next level. I found that my skill levels were already past this book. It is not a back book and it can be good for someone who is fairly new to Elements. But, I don't know if I would really call it Advance. Overall it is not a bad book."
5,Why isn't John Hatfield a household name?,"This CD is freaking awesome! John apparently wrote and recorded this whole thing all by himself. I believe he also played all the instruments. If you like GOOD music, you will love this CD. Several of these songs got some major play on a few of the stations around Lexington, KY. In fact, i heard a song from this cd just the other day on the local NPR station."
5,Kirkus Review is right on...,"Righteous book that turns each corner with speed and danger; a novel of personal discovery and release; characterizations vivid and terse; plot steps along nicely; you can see, smell and hear today's LA without being bogged down; attention to detail is brief and very effective; Marlowe in Ann Klein. A great read and wonderful achievement"
1,Extremely Underwhelmed!,"Very unimpressed with this book. Did not like the writing style at all! The book was quite odd and lots of scenes did not make sense. Had to reread multiple passages because it was so hard to follow!! Lots of times left wondering, where did that come from or what does that have to do with anything?? I highly doubt I will be reading anymore books by April Smith, especially since other reviews have said this book was some of her best work!"
3,Underwhelmed by abridged audiotape,"Depending on libraries is cheap but sometimes not always the best way to go. This is probably one of those times, since I generally wouldn't chose an abridged audiobook. In this case, this editors seemed to have sucked the life out of Ana Grey. So many of the other reviewers talk about an intriguing new protagonist. Well, the Ana I heard was boring and a bit whiney. I just didn't like her.Tape or no tape, the bigger plot is also a bit out there - not the movie star part or the Salvadoran refugees -- just that Ana is related to them. Smith does a good job of portraying life in Los Angeles north of Montana Ave.So, my advice - read the paper version, if anything. If you really want a sizzling new writer from So. Cal - try Don Winslow."
1,Such a waste of money - Glad I bought it used,"""I found this book to be tedious and boring. The writing was very poor and the story line will put you to sleep.I didn't even think the book flap described the plot very well.By the end, I was skipping entire pages just to finish the book.The main character was someone that no one could relate to. I had no sympathy or empathy for her.Just an awful read."""
5,Amazing video!!,I bought this product used and it worked perfectly. This is a wonderful video for anyone who is interested in water sports. Very well-done and totally family-friendly.
4,DEFINITELY A VISUAL GUIDE,FOR SOME REASON PRUNING SEEMS COMPLICATED TO ME. THIS BOOK REALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND THE DO'S AND DON'T. IT HAS GREAT VISUAL AIDS. THERE ARE MANY TOPICS COVERED AND ONCE LOOKED AT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO EXACTLY AS IT WAS EXPLAINED. GREAT BOOK DEDICATED TO PRUNING.
5,Pruning Made Easy,"An excellent guide for pruning everything in the garden. Diagrams are clear and easy to follow. After looking at more that 20 books on pruning, Pruning Made Easy was my choice and I am very satisfied."
4,Very Helpful,"This has been very helpful with all the shrubs, vines, trees, etc I have around the house. I don't want to kill them all. It also helped for the landscaping work I was doing at church on the rose bushes and crepe myrtles."
3,O.K,"I was somewhat disappointed when this book came. I was expecting a detailed description on pruning individual types of trees. For example, I wanted a book that I could look crepe myrtle up in the index go to that page and have a detailed description on how and when to prune. Crepe Myrtle is not even in the index. I am going to buy the Southern Living Gardening book now."
3,Pruning guideline,"It was an okay book, but was hoping for more guidance on how to prune my fruit trees correctly. I only use it once in a great while."
2,Pruning Made Easy,". Not very impressed, poor quality printing. Not really suitable for bookshelf reference, ok in shed. Same information in several other gardening books so nothing new.If this is the standard I prefer to use my local bookshops where I can judge the book on a range of preferences including content, quality and value for money. A three week wait to be disapointed I would rather view, maybe go home and think about it, have another look and convince myself that it is a book I would have in my reference library. Even if it does cost me a few dollas more - I can even select the best and least thumbed copy. Much more satisfaction.My previous purchases have been books that I have already previewed at local bookshops and so I have been pretty sure on what I am getting."
2,Not as pictured,"The pink and purple pictured in the Tropical Seas are not accurate. The set is more like stained or lightly painted wood. The purple makes the legs look dark purple. The pink stain makes the drawers look sort of pink, but you call still see the wood underneath. The picture shows even bright color throughout and it's not like that in person. I am disappointed with the appearance of this desk as compared with the picture. There were no directions for the chair in my box and you have to drill your own holes and get creative to put both the desk and chair together. Not a novice project."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this because I liked the colors and design in the pictures. However, it came with a missing back-support for the chair and the decoration fish. I ordered a replacement and that too was missing the chair piece. Moreover, the replacement set had colors that were distinctly faded/washed as compared to the first one. The first one also had a repaired joist (for want of a better word) underneath the table top. I have pictures that I will upload once I figure out how.The packaging had styrofoam that was aching to crumble. Made a mess at my house entrance. I was sorely disappointed since I had great expectations, having liked the design and colors so much. I wish they would put in just a little more effort. This can be a big seller.I must say though that Amazon customer service is amazingly good. I am a Prime member and the only inconvenience I faced was the effort I put in to repack everything."
4,I loved this book,"It is very easy to read, has plenty of illustrations/pictures. There is soooo much information in this book, I recommend it highly, even for adults.I bought this book in order to learn where certain inventions and discoveries came from.It starts out explaining stone tools (c 3,000,000 BC), the use of fire and continues on throughout time. It ends in 2001 with self-cleaning glass invention.I had to laugh at the first walkman (do young people know what that is?) in 1979.I was amazed at all the things we take for granted, when they were actually discovered, how and so forth. I recommend this book to anybody that is curious about when and what was invented/discovered."
4,The pictures & illustration is great,"Pictures & illustration makes this book more entertains to read although someone can suggest other encyclopedia that gives more information than this book, but for me, it doesn't matter how much or complete the information but how much information reader can get from this book... if you want more complete information you can go further with multi-volume encyclopedia like Britannica or simply using internet to google many information regarding any great invention and discoveries in human kinds. (eg Wikipedia, etc)IMHO, this book is suitable for any level, adults or children, but may be the content is only for leisure reading, not for complete & formal educational purposes, it may wrong to state this book have a complete reference about human inventions but for me it contains 'enough inventions' to be known by us.Lastly, I really enjoyed reading this book. Just my 2 cent :)p/s: sorry for any bad English as it is not my mother tongue."
1,What about 'Discoveries and Inventions' from India,"Many nice pictures but the title of this book may have reflected its contents better if it had been '1000 Inventions and Discoveries from mainly Europe, China, Egypt and the Middle East'. Although it mentions discoveries from 3,000,000 BC, there is practically no mention of any significant discovery from India. The thousands of potential readers of Indian origin and those who know about the great discoveries India has contributed to the world may not appreciate such an 'oversight'. ..."
2,"GREAT ANIMATION, BORING STORY","Why can't they spend as much time on the story, as they do onthe animation? I love these kind of movies, but if they'reboring, I start falling asleep. Kids will like it, becausethe animation is so incredible.(animation 2 stars)(story 0 stars)"
3,"Pretty Good, A little Boring","I was very excited to see this film, I tried to keep an open mind, I even sat down and started it 4 times!Parts of it were clever, goofy, and entertaining. I am a fan of Will Smith, so that was kinda cool. But this movie starts strong, and fizzles out slowly.It is probably pretty good, I just couldn't quite enjoy it."
5,the best dreamworks movie ever made!,"Shark tale is great!It replaced Shrek in my top 3 films!The underwater world has a reef city which is hard to remember that it is not real! Frankie is the son of a shark Don Lino, Also Don Lino has Lenny who is not like other sharks.At Frankie's death, Oscar is mistaken for the killer and he gets a luxury apartment and heaps of friends.However the sharks are angry at Oscar and they want Revenge!"
1,not that good...,"this is not a good movie although my nephew bought i do not like it that much it gets annoying after awhile and it's just a bad movie like everyone else said it was ok? it's just boring,nasty and annoying!!! or wait the actual rating is 1 star even though it doesn't deserve it."
5,excellent service,We received the movie in brand new condition and it plays perfectly and we received it quickly.
3,"Average movie, but a decent one","Oscar, an average fish working at a whale wash (human equivalent to a car wash) is being chased by frankie but then frankie dies (anchor falls on his head) and oscar takes the credit (the amazing SHARK SLAYER) blah blah blah, anyways the plotline and godfather-ish jokes might be hard to understand for little kids. I found it funny, most of it anyway. Well, it's not Finding nemo but its not really bad. i liked it and i would like to get (or at least rent) the DVD (i saw it on HBO)i hope this was a useful reveiw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A mediocre 'tale'.,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was going to be really funny. I barely laughed. I have to give this movie props for the characters I thought were cute (Oscar, Lola) the bright colors, clear picture, and the song Car Wash, but that is where it ends. This is worth a rental and no more than that. I can't see myself watching this again, even when I think it is average. It's nowhere near as appealing as Finding Nemo or Shrek (and those are more for children since the crude humor is toned down) I'm also peeved by the previews at the beginning. Dreamworks needs to stop this nonsense, nobody wants to sit through previews. They should just include those in the extras, then if anyone really wants to view them, it's by choice and not because of being forced into it."
1,Forgetable GARBAGE!,"I am SO glad I saw this movie myself before letting my kids watch it. The dialouge in SEVERAL spots was highly inapproprate for children. I though this was going to be a cute, family film. Similar to Finding Nemo, perhaps? NO!!! Not even close! This is boring, has no real plot, and was a real waste of time and money. At least my kids weren't subjected to this garbage. That's what this is- GARBAGE.Dreamworks should be ashamed of this horrible attempt to ""desensitize"" our children!"
2,No Disney in this tale,"Sharks Tale is cute, but it's not as good as a Disney flick. There's no magic in the movie and no matter how many big name voices there are, it still doesnt make up for the loss."
2,"colorful, but still a kludge",Shark is a kludge of a movie that at its best moments only reminds you of the far better movies that you've already seen--Shrek 2 and Finding Nemo.
3,Is original material to much to ask for?,"Ok to begin, this movie was riding the wake of finding nemo. I mean when I heard about it, I was like another fish movie. But, I wanted to give it a chance because I really enjoyed finding nemo...it was intelligently written. I did not find this to be the case with shark tale. Sure it was funny but only because it took funny lines and situations from other movies. I mean pop trivia was shoved down your throat!!! Instead of coming up with original jokes the sharks were the godfather and every other line was from some other movie. Sure this entertains adults I guess but it just seemed over done. However, the movie is funny but i suggest renting it. Or better yet rent some of the movies it advertises throughout."
4,Underwater World,I love that movie. What I liked the best is that the fishes kind of look like the actors who play them. It's a very funny movie. Good for children and adults. Have fun watching it.
2,not so good....,"this is not ""finding nemo""!! this is a rap music video for fish!!without the singing part. but they cuss alot!!! and oscar hides from a shark but he blows up the shark."
2,A brief overview,"Great music-- Great cast-- Okay but cliché and unengaging plot-- Good animation; some good jokes, a lot of dark humor and morbidity, inappropriate for kids and not great for adults"
2,"the commercials seem great, but the movie is boring","this seems like a good movie when you see the commercials. the animation is great, but this is definitley not Dreamworks Animation's greatest film. the movie is very boring."
1,Shark Tale not for kids,"We bought this DVD because the ads looked cute, and we were expecting another movie like ""Finding Nemo."" The only thing the movies have in common is great animation. Shark Tale has no threads of morality for kids, and the gangster humor is lost on small children and even disturbingly violent. If it is really designed for adults, so be it, but most adults do not buy animated movies unless they are shopping for their kids. The PG rating should be upgraded to PG-13 or even R."
1,"Big Names, Pop Refrences, Piece of Crap","How anyone could like this film is beyond me (except for the kids, hell, I'll include them anyway). Horribly cliched throughout, a bad script, and people who can't do voiceovers for crap, Dreamworks expects the ""celebrity"" voices to save the movie. Boy, did they fall flat on their face. Sure it made alot at the box-office, but that doesn't mean it's a good movie. It means that dozens of zombies with no taste fled to the box office as soon as they seen the overly praising previews. Jack Black is the only saving grace in this movie, my mistake, NO ONE is the saving grace in this movie. A blalant rip-off of ""Finding Nemo"", this movie is another product out of the DreamWorks P.O.S. Factory."
1,it just didnt work out for me,"I got really bored during this movie, why I did is because I really was disapointed. The reason being is that the movie wasnt fully what I accpected. The combination of rap music wasnt that great and Will Smith ( Bad Boys and I, Sinkbot as I like to call it) was annoying as hell. Jack Black (School Of Rock, Envy) did his best and so did Robert DeNiro (Heat, Godfather 2) and Martin Scorsece (Casino, Gangs Of New York) but like I said it wasnt a good kids movie in my mind. Angelina Jolie (Alexander, Sky Captain and The World Tomorrow) in another movie this fall, man shes having a long list as well. Also starring Doug E. Doug (Tv's Cosby, 8 Legged Freaks) and Ziggy Marley (Bob Marleys son) as Jamacian Jellyfish, Katie Couric and Renee Zellweger (Jerry Maguire, White Oleander).For all means I didnt like it but kids might find some of it funny and heart warming."
2,Not so good.................................................,This movie wasn't horrible but it was bad.It wasn't funny and it.........Well.........It just wasn't a good movie.
2,Not for kids,"This mafia-themed movie is over the head of most kids. Better for teens and adults. The whole thing is a metaphor for having a gay son and accepting him for who he is, which is fine, but it's not very entertaining."
5,Best!!,"This is a very good movie. I saw it twice and it did not get boring the second time! Oscar is so funny and Lenny is hillarious, too! YOU HAVE TO SEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Loud, and annoying","Terrible! This movie was nothing like Finding Nemo. Loud and obnoxious. I have too many horrible things to say, but what I can tell you is to get Finding Nemo......."
2,"Hackneyed, not funny, not even cute","Shark Tale simply cannot compare to the better CG (computer generated) animation features from Pixar/Disney. The script is laughably dumb and not cute at all, and the play on ethnicity (Oscar is black, the sharks Italian, Zykes Jewish [?]) borders on being disgusting. Well, if it had been cute and enjoyable like Pixar/Disney films these could have been overlooked and forgiven, but it simply falls flat and leaves a rotten after taste in the end. I was very disappointed in this film."
2,Could Have Been So Much Better!,"I have no problems with the fact that this film was obviously written for an adult audience with hopes that kids would enjoy the animation as well. Who says only kids enjoy a good animated/computer-generated movie? And excellent animation it is -- beautiful scenery!!! I just found the movie a bit dull. I guess after you've seen Shreks 1 and 2 and Finding Nemo, you begin to expect the same level of entertainment in future films of the same genre and this one just didn't hold up in my opinion."
1,Junk....,"Just an all around bad film that I really don't feel is appropriate for kids. As others have noted, the racial stereotypes are about as bad as you can get, the kids in the film get praised for their grafiti, there is a lot of 'product placement', and finally the story isn't worth talking about."
1,boo! hiss!,This DVD has previews that you cannot fast-forward through! What the heck??? FIve minutes that you are forced to watch every time you load this disc. How is that helpful when you have children who just want to watch the movie?Boycott this disc. Convince these overbearing studios to stop forcing you to watch things you don't want to watch
2,Not for kids .. and no skipping over preview trailers either,"Animation: 5/5Story: 3/5For Kids: 1/5Annoying Features: Again as in Shrek 2, Dreamworks made the trailers un-skippable . I'm pretty sure that this is the last Dreamworks movie I'll buy on DVD, because if I pay I want to be able to start the movie right away without having to watch their trailers. It's probably better to rent Dreamworks DVDs from now on. That's to bad, because we enjoyed many animated movies by Dreamworks. It's an annoyance that bugs me more than it should -- but on the other side I pay for the DVD movie not for Dreamworks' commercials. They can make it easy to skip, or put it at the end. The movie itself is actually better than my rating, possibly around 3 stars."
1,Must - Watch - Previews - Again - and - Again - and - Again,"Previews, which are lengthy, are protected - cant forward through them (but you can forward through the FBI warning!). So each time your kid watches this movie, you get to watch the previews the previews the previews again again again."
1,Stereotype Tale,"This is the first review I have ever written, and am compelled to write because this movie was so bad. The number of stereotypes as well as clichéd situations, trite lines, and idiotic storyline must have been the inspiration for Princess and the Frog (thankfully I heard the bad reviews and didn't waste my time watching that catastrophe.) There are smart, witty, kiddie movies. But I suppose there have to be train wrecks. DreamWorks should be embarrassed for drawing such gross racial lines and trying to profit on alienation. The moral of the story was amateur for even children. What a disappointment, what a waste of space on entertainment shelves- but what else would be expected then a major studio trying so hard with such a contrived group of actors. Please avoid this movie!"
2,lay off Nemo's success and come up with your own idea Dreamworks,"I know Dreamworks can keep doing Shrek forever, but they shouldn't of gotten on ""Finding Nemo""s success and make another fish film. It was mediocre because I don't like the fish and their ocean world being humanized, only toons should be humanized. I didn't like Will Smith in this film, pretty much I didn't anybody. Fish just don't look good humanized. It's not this film was big winner anyway. The thing I hate the most is a missy elliot fish and Christina Auguleria fish appear, what has happened to computer animation. When I define a computer animated masterpiece I answer with the first and greatest computer animated film of all time. It's the 10 Anniversary of ""Toy Story"""
3,The animation was great but it lacks the humor,"If you want to buy this movie because you think it's a funny movie_think again...The animation was quite impressive and I'm sure kids would enjoy the colorful images on the screen, but it's not funny unless you're twelve years old or younger, or simply likes to laugh at anything. I know my friend did. I think she particularly finds the 'shrimp' in the movie quite amusing. I forced myself to laugh, just to make her feel comfortable. Although,it wasn't funny, it was quite creative so you might find it entertaining."
3,Cute Movie for the kids!!,"Recieved movie in good condition from the seller. The movie itself was cute, not as cute as a disney princess movie but was great for the kids.My girls (three 3 yr olds)liked it and watch it over and over."
2,Not Oscar-worthy,"I know this movie was supposed to be all that and then some, but it didn't do it for me. I understand that most of the people that are doing the voice-overs in it are Oscar-nominated actors and winners, and some people think that's enough for the movie to get going. WRONG!!I felt like this was a hyped-up version of Finding Nemo, though the soundtrack was a little better than the movie itself. Kids would like it, but they'd probably try to make comparisons between this movie and Finding Nemo, though the stories are different. Or at least that's what my little cousin did. He has a good memory.If you like the upbeat soundtrack, this is great. If not, keep on looking."
2,sharktale: plot-less? trashy? yep.,"I liked Shrek, loved Shrek II, but Dreamworks really went down hill with Shark Tale... to basically sum it up this movie was an A-list cast of voices and jokes we've heard before. Poor man's version of Finding Nemo."
2,"Uninspired movie, annoying trailers","Shark Tale is quite uninspired and is only mildly entertaining, especially when compared to Shrek, Shrek 2, Antz and Finding Nemo.As in Shrek 2, the DVD starts out with 2 non-skippable tailers which have to be fast-forwarded over each time you play the DVD. This is highly annoying - even more so on a DVD I payed good money for. Doubly annoying, one of the non-skippable trailers is even for the same movie as a non-skippable trailer on the Shrek2 DVD. It appears the studio is doing their very best to annoy and drive away their regular DVD customers. It looks like they're succeeding at that."
2,Shark bail,"I have watched 'Shark Tale' many times over the past two weeks and I keep noticing problems in the movie. For on part the things the characters say are so corney. Like in the begging, ""Hi im Oscar, you may think you know but u hve no idea"" what does that mean? I also did not like the dance party thing. It was stupid and dumb. The parody to ""U Cant Touch This"" is just wrong too."
3,good airplane movie,"I saw this appealing film on an airplane going across the country. It was a good way to waste a few hours. I really enjoyed the parodies of the classic gangster films. The bit where the scared little shrimp do a perfect ""Scarface"" turn was pretty priceless. Why is it that animation these days seems to be far more engaging with more craft than most types of films? I'm not a big fan of Will Smith but he makes a good cartoon character. Add this one to your animation collection for some mindless, innocent fun."
5,Better than Nemo!,"This movie was a bit better than ""Finding Nemo"" and has a good plot,a great lesson,and lot`s of good movie things!I think Will Smith has a good voice for Oscar and has a good part in the movie!I know this Review is not very helpful,but i`m telling you......go see this movie!!!!!!!!!"
4,It Aint No Shrek!,"This is what Nemo would be like if he lived in Jamaica for a while. While Will Smith bring the fish world a lot of urban hip hop flava, it just doesn't help the movie. There was only one really funny moment in the movie where I laughed! But sadly, I can't remember where it was.A film with this many stars should have spent more on writing, since most of the new CGI movies have a lot of laughs in them, which in turn makes them memorable. I'm sure the kiddies will love this movie more than I did, but it just didn't do that much for me. I wonder how much Will got paid for the movie? Frankly, as a Fresh Prince fan, I think he should stick to the Action Genre, and leave his Fresh Price comedy days , back in the 80's. BTW, I, Robot was excellent! Why all the shabby reviews?"
1,A FISH MOVIE MADE TO APPEAL TO ADULT BLACK CULTURE,all racism aside - talking fish who act black is just stupid and annoying
1,Urbanizing Nemo,"Yeah, umm..It would have been better if they payed fees to disney and given nemo a gold tooth and some bling.This movie has no heart."
2,What A Gay Movie!,"This movie may be for kids, but there is an underlying theme that seems to strike out at adults. How to accpet your children for what they turn out to be and be happy about it.Voice acting and animation was good, thus the 2 stars. Most of the characters were lame, up to and including those 2 stupid jellyfishes. The Times Square layout of the reef and the hint of mafia in New York was also an underlying theme, which was almost Godfather-like in a comical sense.The plot was a typical Hollywood love story plot, poor fish has a girl, can't see she's in love with him, wants to become a celebrity, but turns out to be a lie, until proven wrong etc, etc, etc.Finally, this movie is purely for the innocent kids out there who want to marvel at the animation and a good laugh, and who still can't get enough of Finding Nemo. Personally, I recommend that parents bring their kids to watch The Incredibles!In the meantime, dolphin nose, blue paint and scarf anyone?"
3,Lacked an endearing story,"My almost four year old enjoyed this one at the theater, so I bought the dvd. It's entertaining enough to be watched by older teens and adults, because much of the humor is adult themed, and it's over the top of the heads of most youngsters, so they'll just enjoy the action and bright lights.It may not be that great of a film for the middle ages, those that kind of get the adult humor, but aren't really old enough to really understand it or, at least, shouldn't.While the premise of loving others as they are is a good one, it may have been too much to tackle here in a kids animation, at least the way it was done. How many stars do we need? How many references to products, songs, movies, etc., of pop culture does a movie need?Not nearly as good as Finding Nemo, Shrek, Ice Age or some of the other well written animations that adults love too, this movie still gets enough stars to be worth seeing, and even worth owning if the audience is right."
1,"Not good, not good at all...","If I had wanted to watch Will Smith, I would have watched a Will Smith movie. If I had wanted to watch Robert de Niro, I would have watched a Robert de Niro movie. Instead, I watched Will Smith and Robert de Niro disguised as fish!!!! Give me a break!!! Lousy movie, ridiculous story, no funny at all. Long live Finding Nemo, Shrek and now the incredibly wonderful The Incredibles."
5,Shark Tale,"The movie was is great shape. It arrived to my home a lot sooner than I thought, my son loves this movie."
2,Had enough of these yet?,"Pixar has pumped out yet another CGI kid/adult friendly movie, this time its about fish - again (Hoo-boy!). Talking fish, again. There is nothing really reprehensible about Shark Tale, it just seems that Pixar rolls these barely funny, unoriginal films off of the assembly line every year.Sure, the Pixar films look pretty but when are they going to make a ""Spirited Away"" or better yet: make their own ""Akira""? It looks like never since another one of these films is coming out next year.Ho-hum.."
2,Nemo is way better.,When I first saw previews for this movie I thought It would be stupid. And boy was I right. Not ragging on Dreamworks. There a good animation studio bringing us classics like the first 2 shrek movies and Spirit. But This movie I thought was so pointless. I mean it has good animation and 20% of the movie is funny that's why I'm giving it a 2. I hate the Club Oscar feature is like Far Far Away Idol but it's getto. And you can learn how to dance like the characters on the Club Oscar Feature. (YEAH NOW I CAN DANCE LIKE M.C HAMMER). Also all the fish act ghetto. If you want to see this movie watch it on tv or borrow it from a friend. I think the kids would like it but if you want a talking fish movie get Finding Nemo.
3,A good animated movie.,I guess I saw this movie with high expectations but was somewhat let down. The animation was awesome but the plot and the comedy of the movie was flat. The storyline was old news with virtually no new twists. It is worth seeing but I will leave it at that.
5,Funny,This movie will make you laugh. Will smith did anexcellent job playing his character. I could not stopluaghing
4,ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???!!!,"This is movie is a like a blue-collar Disney-PIXAR film. The animation, color, graphics are not the best we've seen, however, that does not make the film any less enjoyable. It is very funny and has many references to real life and other movies. Similar to what we saw in Shrek 2. Examples are the Times Square setting, the similarities of the characters to 'The Godfather' and references to other hollywood films such as 'Gladiator'... 'Are you not entertained???!!!'.This movie is definitely more for adults than for kids. That's not to say that kids wouldn't enjoy it, but there are references to many things and inside jokes that would just go unnoticed by younger viewers. The mob leader Don Lino actually looked like (and not just sounded like) a cartoon shark version of Robert DeNiro, haha. And the funniest part of the movie for me was when Lenny painted himself up to look like a dolphin. hilarious! Personally, I thought it was a great movie and worth watching. 4 stars."
1,DVD do not work in Australia,"I purchased three DVD's for my daughter's Christmas presents and although they were delivered promptly and in time for Christmas, none of them work in Australia. Which is very disappointing and impossible to explain to a two year old wanting to watch the cartoon. I took it for granted that the DVD's I ordered would be compatible with the technology in the country from which I ordered it. Unfortunately, not."
2,Shark Tale,"I was reluctant to even watch this movie. That said, I was able to sit through the entire movie, but it wasn't without its challenges. This movie was extremely hard to pay attention to. It was moderately funny and exciting for a children's movie, but offered little in the sense of buy in. Shark Tale is a typical poorly written movie that uses star power for ratings instead of good writing."
1,Another dreamworks ripoff,"This movie is a flat excuse to ride on the coattails of Pixars beloved Finding Nemo. It has fish in it but unfortunately for Dreamworks, it possesses none of the magic that Nemo has. Don't waste your money on a copycat film."
2,WHA???!!!,"Well, Shark Tale isn't as horrible as Barnyard, but it's still REALLY bad. The jokes never succeeded in making me laugh, the celebrity voices were distracting and very unnecessary, and the movie itself is tedious. And I mean TEDIOUS! I almost couldn't take it anymore. A Troll in Central Park had something more interesting than this, and that's really saying something. And oh boy, you'll be begging for all these characters to go away. They're as annoying and uninteresting as the ones you find in the ever-dreadful Disney Channel. I give credit for the film's decent 3D animation, though; that was the one that avoided me from completely hating this movie. But yeah, I'm sure the kids will love this. But when it comes to teenagers and adults, this will be a devastating disappointment. Just rent it if you're in the mood for some good 3D animation."
5,GREAT,"I bought Shark Tale for my new family. I just had a baby boy 4 months ago and since Shark Tale was one of my favorite movies, I wanted to start by buying this movie and a few others to have a nice collection for my baby boy. This movie came fast and in the sealed package. I would definately order from this person again! Thank you!"
2,Not Very Funny,"Talk about disappointing. ""Shark Tale"" comes off as a very poor imitation of ""Finding Nemo"". Not even Will Smith could save this one. A big two thumbs down."
3,OK Movie,"shark Tale is a decent movie. It does not have the wit and charm of Shrek but its OK entertainment. It is basically a parody of ""The Godfather"". This movie was made to cash in on the success of Pixar's ""Finding Nemo."" This movie does not have anywhere near the charm of ""Finding Nemo."" Shark Tale is geared more toward adults."
3,Entertaining Enough To Watch Once,"There isn't anything fundamental about this movie, but it was still entertaining. It was funny and the voices fit the persona of the characters.There were many laugh-out-louds moments and you've got to be paying attention or else you might miss some of the humor (there is a 5 second spot where a fish is going out of business because he opened a sushi shop!!).The brightest spot about this movie is, without a doubt, Will Smith. Can you not love the guy!!! He is amazing and very entertaining.But, my biggest complaint is the character the Will plays, Oscar. Oscar is a fish who will do anything (lie, cheat, steal, and take advantage of others) and I hate seeing a character like this made the hero for children to see. It takes more than being entertaining to be somebody worth looking up to."
2,Slay Shark Tale!!!!,"Shark Tale was suppose to be a modern day sea adventure with hip music and fantasy sea world. Shark Tale fails... Orginally seeing the adds for Shark Tale I had the hope that it would be ""Finding Nemo"" meets Shrek but, it wasn't... this a generic rip off of the craze that came from Nemo and added with a few cheesy lines.The kids I saw this with all hated it and the only good thing in this movie was seeing the cute Vegan Shark(who is hardly seen in the movie it focuses more on Will Smith's fish). The animation is just crummy not up up to the usual Dreamworks standards you see in the Shrek movies and the voice talents although good fail to save this movie!But, what do you expect from a movie that focuses on vegetarian sharks and fish? The storyline is predictable and over-dramtised at times... The worst bit of this movie were when the pop songs came up. All in all this not a movie I would waste my money on rent or buy Nemo or Shrek instead! And slay Shark Tale from your mind!"
1,AVOID AT ALL COST,"The WORST Animated movie ever made. I sat thru this boring, shallow story hoping it would get better and it just got worse. Bad music, bad story, bad voice talent, over payed voice talent.The low point of this movie was when CGI fish versions of Missy Eliot and that other chick sang car wash. Hey, it was a WHALE WASH not a car wash.AVOID this movie. Watch a Pixar movie over and have alot better time. I can't beleive this came from the makers of Shrek which I loved."
5,Super Funny,"This movie helped me to relax after a hard day's work. After being so tensed and stressed at work, I was able to come home and laugh out loud...and relax.Of course my eight year old daughter was surprised that I had bought this movie for her. She loves it too. She even wonders whether I bought the movie for her or myself.It is a movie for the entire family to enjoy quality time together."
2,Avoid,"For every Finding Nemo, there is a Shark Tale, an unimaginative piece of dreak that proves that no matter how good the animation is, it does not compensate for a good story. The voices provided by Will Smith and the cast is fine but they like the rest of us are let down by a by the numbers story that has no heart or substance and are full of stereotypes that offend other than charm.I suggest you see Finding Nemo for the hundredth time other than sit though this."
2,Mediocre,"A rip off of dozens of films and animations, this film, with its unfunny dialog, makes one cringe. The set up pieces for medicore pop music are shameful.The animation itself is quite good, practically the only saving grace of an insipid movie."
2,A HUGE disappointment,"This movie was beautifully animated and the characters were drawn to actually LOOK LIKE their human counterparts. That, however, was the only worthwhile aspect of Dreamworks' biggest flop to date.Voice work by Will Smith, Angelina Jolie, Renee Zellweger and countless others with ""star power"" couldn't save this movie from certain death.It was a fresh idea and had great potential, but fell quite flat in the end... you get an A for effort, fellas, but unfortunately you get an F for results!"
4,Great Tale......,"OK, this is the first review I've ever written on a cartoon! I normally never watch cartoons and stick to my horror movies. A friend brought over this video and at first I was like, ok I'll suffer thru a kid's cartoon! Well, I truly enjoyed this film. I give it a 4 star rating because for a cartoon, this film is both funny and entertaining. Even without the aid of celebrity voices, Shark Tale would still earn 4 stars in my book. Very funny characters in this movie along with good music. Well written to keep everyone entertained. I had some good laughs with this movie and think it's one of the best animated films to date. Much better than Shrek or Shrek 2 !!!!!"
3,A changed story,"One of the most known versions of Robin Hood comes fromIvanhoe (Penguin Classics).The general story is that the Sheriff of Nottingham is a Norman servant of King John , King Richard's brother.Robin of Locksley is a Saxon Nobel whose father is dispossessed while Robin is away fighting with King Richard in the crusades.So on two counts the story is faulty from the traditional Robin Hood:1) the historical period of Saxon and Normans, crusades2) the age of Robin, here 17, as too youngThere have been something like ten movies, three major releases, of Robin Hood. Most have used the Locksley model of history with King John as a major source of the trouble of turning good Saxons bad in a Norman ruled era.Although not that bad in the telling as it covers the major tales involved,the object of education is faulted in the historical errors."
4,Robin Hood,"Robin Hood is one of the books I enjoyed reading. It has action, and adventure and a few historical facts. Robin Hood takes place a long time ago, probably in the middle ages. Robin Hood is the main character. He is handsome, brave and he has a bood heart and he steals from the rich and gives to the poor. Robin Hood has a little romance. For example when Robin says ""I will win the archer competition and take the gold arrow and give it to the princess to be mine!"" I would recommend this book to people who like action and adventure."
1,Not like my original Spam Musubi Press,This press was made too deep. It's hard to make the rice patties the right thickness and the Nori (seaweed) gets ripped and crushed in the process. At the end it's difficult to eject the sandwich. I wish I did not buy it for my friends and family for Christmas gifts. The problem is I can't find the same model that I purchased 20 years ago from Hawaii.
2,"Flat, uneventful, and too sentimental","All in all, the movie disappointed me. First of all, there isn't much Christianity in it, but I can handle that if it's a really well-turned and interesting story - which it isn't. It's flat, a little boring, and uneventful. The lead character is extremely vague and weak in his acting (not just in his actual character in the movie). All the way through the story, I was rooting against the protagonist...! There isn't much to make you sympathize with him, except for the fact that he went through a divorce, which you don't really get to experience with him, so all we see is this weak character with a highly sentimental attitude. The good parts in this movie are the people telling him to do exactly the opposite of what he wants to do, plus some good comments by his mentor about why God allows people to go through something like that. But, everything taken into consideration, if you want a Christian love story, watch Fireproof or No greater love instead."
2,I really wanted to like this movie,"I saw the trailer for this movie about a year ago, maybe more. I was looking forward to it but when I watch it with my mother I was pretty let down.The Acting was good but the characters just weren't believable. The situations were a little too far fetched and the main character's behavior was just downright stalkerish. The female lead's character was enjoyable but seemed way too forward for it to seem real. I won't spoil it by going into detail but if you've seen the movie you know what I mean.The main focus of the movie is divorce and dealing with the pain. This is a pretty relevant topic but the movie gave no real answers for people dealing with the pain of divorce or separation. For a Christian movie to leave out something as vitals as this was a complete let down.In the end it isn't something that I would watch again or recommend, sadly."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this DVD for my Dad's wife, who has wanted to get it since she first heard about it. She received it and when I asked her how she liked it, she said she was very disappointed, that it wasn't at all like what she expected. And that's about all I can say since I didn't watch it. I had read other reviews about Me & You, Us, Forever that would have made me think twice about ordering it, but since it wasn't for me, I just placed the order and checked on it later. Hope this was helpful."
5,Completely absorbing drama . . .,"Me & You, Us, Forever - I liked that it came from true events and experience. The adaptation was unapologetically Christian, yet characters are engaging, sharp and convincing, nothing shallow or phony.As one who is divorced and has never considered group therapy before, nor remarried, nor participated in extramarital physical relationships, I am now open to trust and explore this myself and see what happens."
2,Only if your divorced or going through one...,"If your going through a divorce or divorced that's the only way you will sit through this movie. I had trouble in the male characters judgement. It got to the point where I just wanted to scream at the TV and say ""Just stop it - are you blind""? I suffered through the acting but the message was clear... you can't live in the past. ((People change))"
5,DVD - New condition,"The movie got here in a very timely manor. It was everything the seller said it was, new condition with the rap still on it."
3,Nearly right !,"A group of mystery story fans meets regularly to review the latest thrillers but when the plots of a particular author begin to play out in real life, and some of the book club members are murdered in the same style as those in the latest book, people really start to look over their shoulders.It's an interesting premise and though I believe that the author threw in too many unnecessary characters as red herrings, perhaps her style will improve with more experience."
4,A great introduction to the merchant marine,"One of the first books issued to midshipmen at Kings Point (www.usmma.edu), the American Merchant Seaman's Manual is a whirlwind tour of everything the new mariner should know before going to sea. It introduces the fundamentals of navigation, ship handeling, deck seamanship, cargo handeling, safety of life at sea, and countless other important subjects. The serious mariner will quickly graduate to more detailed navigation and seamanship texts, but the American Merchant Seaman's Manual remains an important ready reference. I can offer no higher praise than this: Of the leangthly reading list for sea duty, this is one of the few books that midshipman actually reference in their sea projects."
5,Great Item,"This is really a great item, very comfortable. I would have no problem wearing them for more than girlfriend if the opening was not so loose. Great for the intended purpose though."
2,Metallic Boxers,Very disappointed with these - poorly made and ill-fitting. Far too expensive for the price. What a disappoitment and again too much hassle to return and argue with the company.
5,"The Amityville ""Hoax's""","This is a very fine telling of the events that were to become the most famous ""haunting"" of our time. On the night of Nov. 13,1974, drug crazed Ron Defeo Jr. shot and killed all five members of his family. After a short investigation, he was sent to jail and the house sold to the Lutz's family. After 28 days there the family fled in the middle of the night and said that demons and all manner of supernatural ""things"" forced them out of the house. Not long after, with Author Jay Anson They gave the world ""The Amityville Horror"" and made millions! Besides giving us the facts as told by the family this excellent program looks into the case and finds many things that don't add up in the story. A fine piece of reporting that shows this was one of the better ""Hoax's"" ever done on the American people. Well worth the time and money!"
5,amityville the haunting,this dvd is great and very information is intresting te hear and see for your self to believe i9n the supernatual existance in that house a must have for your other amityville horror movies too complete your collection.
4,Histories Mysteries---The Amityville Horror,"Interesting historical documentary behind the Amityville house, property, the residents over the past 200 years."
2,wrong product,"They sent the wrong jersey. After several phone calls, they admitted that they had the wrong picture on their web page. Despite the inconvenience, they did pay for the return postage."
5,Stunning songs,"I listen to this album almost every day. I wish there were audio links to the songs so others could get an idea of to them. Heather Kropf's style is influenced by all kinds of musicians: Joni Mitchell, Paul Simon, Sade, for example. She is one of those few musicians who writes well AND sounds good. The song ""Cholera"" is inspired by Gabriel Garcia Marquez's LOVE IN THE TIME OF CHOLERA. Kropf sings, ""Like vines leading to angels/ If they take you in/ If they let you stay/ Ask no questions/ & look for no answers/ Vines leading to angels/ Will she take you in/ Will she let you stay?"" (By the way, there's good news for all Kropf fans: she's coming out with a new album soon!)"
2,"Not a ""How to Draw"" Book....","I was disappointed in this book after reading the great reviews printed here. This is not a ""How to Draw"" book at all, but focuses much more on the publishing/layout end of the comic book biz. Nothing like its title suggests: ""How to Draw and Sell Comic Books."" Sigh. What a let down.The art instruction inside is minimal, and most of the art is fully completed and consists of comic panels and pages from comic books. Most of which, are well done - but failed to enlighten me.For those interested in reading about comics, this might be the way to go. For those looking to learn drawing techniques, you'll probably be disappointed in this book. I know I was."
4,Works great in a dry climate,"I have been using this face lotion for years. Denver can be very dry and this always works very well for me and I tend to have dry skin anyway. I only gave it 4 stars because I don't think it has any sunscreen in it, which isn't a big deal for me but may be for others."
5,Phytomer,"I have been using phytomer for twenty years and even though I am 69, my skin is better than it was 15 years ago! I was delighted when I found phytomer on amazon less expensive and NO SHIPPING !"
1,If you have a list,"If you have a list of movies you would like to purchase for yourself, gift or children this should NOT be on it. Actually, YOU could have made this movie. The acting is non-existant, period. The plot is weak to predictable and hopefully they spend less than $1000 making it as that is how it looks and feels. I was tired of watching it within the first minutes as it was painful to endure. Referrences to Harry Potter, etc., are pure imagination and creative marketing. THIS IS A PASS!"
1,Powerful Fact or Interesting Fiction??,"Having Watched the movie or read the book doesn't make someonean expert in the events of 20th May. Even as one of the victims of the ""Protagonist"" aka, Ms Dann, the reality is Killers don't show their true colors to everyone, despite what books or movies might portray. The only reasons the media give you this impression is so you feel safe at home ""knowing"" you don't know anyone capable of this... the fact is you can never know what the person next to you is capable of. If you want to know a bit more about the events then you could read this book- but remember, this is a book... and as such falable! Read with caution and remember,interpretation of events does not make for gospel truth!"
5,This is..,"such a good book.It's so compassionately written with such A rich,viVid detail of the life and humanity and loves of Laurie DaNn.IT does not deserve one stars!I smoked pot with one of the teachers in this case.A very bad thing,and I callEd the cops (LuckilY I've only smoked it once..) on myself (ChrisSy..Be good..)years later as a cop gave it to us!Bad!(I know Dan Collins also..)to uS.Laurie Dann waS a person just like anyone elSe..Sad.Detailed.Tragic.Firsthand almost.A good commentary by a ChicagoAn I think whO thinks that we're alL the same.."
2,Boring - basically a bunch of identical interviews,"The video shows little or no fight footage. The video shows little or no day-to-day ""life of a fighter"" footage. Its basically the same 6-8 fighters answering these questions:-as a fighter, can you ever stop learning?-why is mma hard or cool for you?-what does it take to be a champion?The video has terrible production quality... bad sound quality, can't hear some of the dialogue. I prefer other mma documentaries."
2,Not a documentary,"Hey, I want to start out by saying that I'm a fan of Bas Rutten. I also love documentaries, so I figured watching this would be a double win. Well, the dvd failed on both points. All this dvd consists of is a series of gym shots of people practicing and a few interviews where everyone says the same thing over and over.You would be more entertained playing Parappa the Rapper... ""Kick punch it's all in the mind."" That is all."
2,Poor shipping & service from ReStockIt,"I am quite disappointed in my order of 2 Texas Instuments 34 II calculators. When I received the shipment yesterday (much later than anticipated), it contained 2 TI 34 calculators NOT the TI 34 II calculators that I ordered. The packing list was correct but the calculators were not."
4,Aother omission commas,"I know, most people probably do not care, I must have some kind of dyslexia because when I see 4589339 I have no idea what that is, looks like my ex-gf's phone number (shudder) as compared to 4,589,339 which I instantly recognized as 4 million, 5 hundred thousand,etc."
3,Oui ........MAIS,Ce n'est pas un opéra vraiment indispensable comme le plupart des Opéras de Massent - Il y a quelque bonnes pages vraiment très belle ; mais on ne peut pas en dire autant de tous l'opéra - Christian (le bon navire) France
5,This should be required reading in US high schools!,"Having gone down my own path of working at minimum-wage jobs, being a single mother, receiving food stamps and Medicaid for a short time when my child was small and I had to be home with her, this was a poignant read. Since that time I was able to complete my degree and am gainfully employed.That said, this is an excellent book that explores the realities the poor face, and hints at solutions. Shipler does a fine job of provoking critical thought about why people aren't able to pull themselves out of poverty, rather than pointing an angry finger.The book really should be an educational tool used at an age where school is mandatory. Had I read this book in high school, rather than college, perhaps I would've been more keenly aware of the path I should have taken in the first place. There is nothing like living through mistakes to teach, but this could come awfully close."
5,Great Reading,"This is a book everyone in America should read. It shows many sides of the poverty issue. It does get confusing sometimes with which individual she is talking about but is easy, interesting reading."
4,Powerful view of the difficulties of the poor and our country's inabilitiy to manage the whole picture,"Extremely well written and very readable. Real life views from the poor and what they face daily, from both the external and internal perspectives. Should be a ""must read"" by all our elected politicians."
3,"Good data, Few answers","The author gives very good (and well-written) case studies and analyzes the situations of several working poor and their families. Gave me a better appreciation for the tangle of issues families 'living on the edge' face. I was looking forward to some concrete suggestions for solving portions of the constellation of problems . . . he did offer a few, but on the whole, his answer was to 'elect Democrats.' Huh. Like one political party or another is the answer. Worth reading, until the last chapter, but don't expect to see any serious ideas for making things better. On the other hand, if it were easy or cheap, it would have been handled already."
5,well researched,"I found Working Poor to be well-researched, and I prefer it's tone to Nickel and Dimed. Shipler was thorough and balanced in his view of the poor in America. In the various stories, Shipler takes us into the psyche of the ""working poor"", showing the different circumstances that allowed these individuals to remain, or get into poverty."
4,"""Strip Mall"" Flunkies","Though the working poor in the US would be rich compared to other countries, it is troubling to see the progression of ""strip mall"" flunky jobs over the last 20 years. Shipler's book provides in-depth narrative on the people this trend affects. It also gives great insight to the problems, frustrations and institutional bureaucracy experienced by the ""working poor"". This book illustrates the ""interlocking effects"" when any aspect of the ""working poor's"" life is disrupted."
1,Working Poor,"We all must see and understand the ""other"" america......Why arethey hidden from our view. We can't correct an evil if we denyits existence/...read..read..read..write..write..write..vote !!"
3,Good Information,"The reason I rate this book so low is not that it is uninteresting, or full of bad information, or unrealistic, or uninformative, or unrevealing of the problem of the working poor. I used to be the working poor and I already lived this, I saw myself and my friends in it , the ones who climbed out tnad the ones who didn't.that"
3,An unscholarly but entertaining read:,"This book is an easy read for those who don't have the time or inclination to pursue this subject further. No source material is given for any of the chapters. It seems to be plagarized from a number of other works on this subject. I'm not familiar with this writer and wonder if he's primarily a writer of fiction. Anyway, he covers in an entertaining way most of the well known Amazonian explorers but leaves out true greats such as Henry Walter Bates, who only gets a passing reference,and Candido Rondon and Richard Evans Schultes, both of whom are not even mentioned. But he includes Julio Arana, for who, as far as I am concerned, cannot even be classified as an explorer. Perhaps he is included because his reign of terror as a rubber baron on the upper Amazon makes for spicy reading. The serious student of this interesting subject should go to ""The Explorers of South America"" by Edward J. Goodman for a serious study."
2,Too little and out of date,"The author begins the book by stating ""most of it has been written over the last six weeks"". Well, Steve, it shows! The book is a glossy overview of the basic features, but is neither thorough nor deep. Pages of HTML code examples do nothing more than state what function is happening here - good luck to a novice that actually has to do something in HTML.The book is based on HTML Help version 1.1, and I wish I had counted how many times it said such-and-such doesn't work yet, but it will in version 1.2 due out in 1998. Well it's the fall of 1999 now, and I downloaded version 1.22 from the Microslop site only to discover most of the book's examples won't work with it.I bought this book because I wanted to begin an HTML Help project at my company. After studying the book and examples, I have revised my plans to avoid HTML Help altogether."
3,Basic,"Gives basic information on how to create an HTML project, and on the functionality of HTML help. It is sponsored by Microsoft, and it shows. Nowhere does it cover the issues, bugs and shortcomings of HTML-help, or possible workarounds.However, the book does cover all the basic information you need to develop an HTML-Help project and is a must-have for anyone developing in this media; if only because it is the only book on this topic. For basic info, it is good. For real insider tips, you have to look elsewhere or struggle alone."
3,A good book to gain an overall understanding of HTML Help.,"I found this book helpful in the sense that it gave me some overall understanding of what can be achieved with HTML Help. As is often the case, this book did not go far enough in providing detailed descriptions of what is possible with the ""cutting edge"" of HTML Help systems. The long pages of HTML were tedious to read and should have excluded from the printed publication, yet included on the CD-ROM. Regardless, I found the book helpful, well written and worth the purchase price. I know that authoring is not an easy occupation, however I would like to see an advanced book on this same topic from Steve Wexler."
1,This book is not useful for an application developer.,"This book contains numerous screen shots, but very little useful information. In particular, this book does not provide coverage of application development topics such as how to implement id-mappings for context-sensitive help."
1,How not to write a help book,"First of all, the book assumes that everyone is already familiar with all computer functions. It is extremely user-unfriendly and most examples are inconsistent with the current version. Worse yet, in the examples, seems like many steps are skipped and you have to sort of grope with it for a while. Are there no other books on this topic?"
1,One Of The Worst Technical Books Ever...,"This book is written in a point-and-click, monkey-see monkey-do format. If you follow the steps EXACTLY you will end up with (usually) a working help file with no explanation for what you have been doing. The author even tells you that some of his code ""won't run in this version but will in the next"" - and most don't. Half of the things I want to know (TOCs, FullText indexes, WhatsThisHelp for VB, etc.) do not have adequate (if any) coverage. It is too bad that the minimum rating is 1 star because I don't even want to give it that. If you are looking for a ... guide to ineffectual help systems - this is the book for you! Everyone else - save your money for a DECENT tech reference that is worth reading..."
5,Good So Far,Just started with the book 5 days ago. It is a great help and it seems to be written well. I hope I'll be an expert in no time.
1,Not worth the money!,"One star because this appears to be the only book available on the subject. The examples are POOR and incomplete, if they exist at all. There has to be more than this to HTML help."
2,To much screen dumps vs text,"As most Computer books this one has loads of screen dumps, but if you have to create some HTML Help files it's a good start."
3,Talented group of men,"Most of my household loves Celtic Thunder. Very talented men, singing uplifting, fun songs. I would rate this higher but it is visibly evident they are doing the show by lip-synching. My 9 year old son even said it could have been done better had you not been able to tell. But, wonderful songs, great concept and talented, good looking guys and gals. A lot of fun and enjoyment to be had!"
3,"Something new, but not necessarily better.","I've loved Celtic Thunder since the first time I heard them. I have always liked the way they show off the songs-props etc. Almost like a skit for each song.I have to say this DVD was a little disappointing, but I'm not exactly sure why.I'm sorry to say I probably wouldn't recommend this DVD."
5,group entertainment,this is my type of easy listening music.Good story line interesting lyrics fast moveing great harmony. Like all there other dvds wonderfull interaction of there inderviduals talent.irish music show or concert that makes you want to replay over and over. Have collected all there dvds for there musical and entertainment value.
3,Stage play?,"The music and songs are beautifully done. Costumes are wonderful. However, it is not celtic music. It is set up like a stage play. I was very disappointed in the DVD. I have watched it one time, won't watch it again. I was hoping for better through the complete show but better never happened. The CD was better but only because I could not watch what was going on....These gentlemen have such wonderful talent and voices. I hate to see them go downhill in this manner. I understand the desire to do something new but this was way off the hook. I wasted my money buying it. Not sure I will buy anything else of theirs."
3,Disappointed,"I preordered this DVD and waited anxiously for its arrival. My mom is as much a fan of Celtic Thunder as I am and we always plan a special day when a new CT DVD arrives. We were both sadly disappointed with this one. I think the producers/directors of Celtic Thunder should leave things alone and just keep giving us concerts like It's Entertainment, Heritage, the Show, etc. These shows are what have made these guys so popular with their fans. Phil Coulter - just write a few songs that highlights what we love about these wonderful entertainers.A loyal fan from New Mexico and still waiting for your tour to come to my state so I can enjoy you all in person!Carry on Celtic Thunder :-)"
4,Celtic Thunder: Storm,"This musical presentation is well done, and I appreciate the professionalism that is behind the production of this kind of entertainment."
3,I love Celtic Thunder a lot!,"I have all of the other CT DVS's and I thought this one did not add up to my expectations. But, as always, the music was fabulous!"
3,Recording issue,Video quality and show was nice to watch. Noticed during the second song that the actual sound was not in sync with the video itself. After a while it started to get annoying and I had to stop. Don't know if it is something that was screwed up during production or if it's just my dvd that has the problem
5,Celtic Thunder Storm,These guys are good. I like all the cds and dvds that they have made. What more can I say
4,Dynamic,"From reading previous reviews, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I love Celtic Thunder Storm! Very cool! That said, I do agree with the reviewer who asked what the heck is up with Damian's tattered and dirty clothing. It could have been toned down a bit. It was so exaggerated it seemed almost clownish. I guess Damian was too young and cooperative to point out that he looked uncomfortably out of place with the others."
3,Celtic Thunder Storm,Didn't like the format of their performance. It's too bad they chose the go this way on the last CD of the original beloved group.
5,Great DVD,"I enjoyed this DVD very much. Worth the money and real good entertainment. Great music, great acting. Another fabulous piece of Celtic Thunder work!"
1,Not up to their previous work,"First let me say all of their previous dvds are absolutely fantastic. You can't go wrong with any of them. But Storm was a huge disappointment. Instead of the previous mixtures of Irish songs and pop songs, this was apparently completely written by one person, not one song that was memorable. After watching this dvd once, I'm donating it to the local library. At least library patrons won't have wasted their money. Instead, buy any of their previous dvds--you won't be disappointed."
1,Celtic Thunder - Storm DVD,"I am a fan BUT this is the worst yet!!! They should stick to singing not try to be a Broadway show. It doesn't work. I bought both the CD & DVD & I am sorry that I did. We want to hear Irish music, there were only 2 Irish songs on this DVD/CD."
1,Celtic Thunder Not Show Boat,"This was very disapoiting, it was notting more that a long skit, Not real singing, just a musical version. I would not recament it. Celtic Thunder is giving less minets of time on every DVD, it sucks, The Show was 1 hour and 40 min. The Take me Home was 1 hour and 44 Min, The It's Entertainment 57 min, Celtic Thunder Christmass 1 Hour & 02 min, Heritage 1 Hour & 03 min, Storm 1 Hour & 01 min, Voyage 1 Hour. So they are giving us a Just over a 1/2 of a show compared to when they frist started, they get us wanting more, but give you less. At least Celtic Woman Gave 1 Hour and 31 min, on the last Beleave DVD, 30 min more then you get with Celtic Thunder. That Sucks!"
5,CT,"Just another good dvd. This was more like a musical play, which was very interesting and a departure from their norm."
5,Celtic Thunder: Storm EXCELENT!,"Celtic Thunder NEVER dissapoints. They are very talented and personable. They are like a part of my family and I love having them in my living room teaching me all they're songs. This was a ""have to have"" dvd that I could not live without. I started out with them in 2007, and when the next dvd comes out, I always have to have it. People all over the world love them. I'm just another fan."
3,Costume musicals are not their thing,"My 95 yo mother loves watching these guys. The music is good, the material is not over the top. I like the special features more, I've seen these DVDs 3 or 4 times now. This is probably not their best stuff. But it was a concept to try. Kinda like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The musical""."
3,Quite entertaining,"It is always a treat to watch the guys from Celtic Thunder in action. As usual they were in good voice and entertaining. However, I thought the sound quality was a bit ordinary and the plot thin to the point of non existent. Still enjoyable, but it won't be watched as often as their other DVDs."
2,celtic thunder STORM,Not to my liking.....first part of the DVD was horrible ..trying to jazz it up was wrong. I made a mistake in purchasing this DVD.
5,STORM,"Have all CDs and DVDs by Celtic Thunder and love them all. Storm represents a different view but is still filled with the wonderful songs, harmony and enjoyable entertainment that Celtic Thunder has always provided."
5,The Real Best of Asia!,"Don't be fooled by the boatload of Asia collections. This is the greatest hits package to purchase. There are 3-4 Asia greatest hits CDS that focus on Asia from 1992 onward. The new band doesn't include John Wetton, Carl Palmer and Steve Howe. This CD includes all the hits that made Asia a huge smash in the eighties. They were all remastered and sound wonderful. As others have stated, it's a shame that the CD contains two edited tracks(Here Comes The Feeling and Sole Survivor). These two tracks are classics and should be heard in their entirety. The CD does include three b-side tracks. These three tracks make the CD a must have, even if you own all of the original albums. To hear Steve Howe's guitar playing along with John Wetton's voice on three tracks that I haven't heard before is great! This CD rocks!"
5,ASIA SOLE SURVIVOR!,This is a excellent compilation of ASIA. One of the last groups that play progressive/pop/hard rock so well! The cd features 3 songs never included on a ASIA original albums. Enjoy!
3,"Good Compilation of Songs, Very Bad Sound Quality","I love all the songs on this cd. I can't argue with the selection, but when I plopped it into my cd play I was shocked at how bad the songs sounded. For a cd from a band like Asia to succeed you need to have a crisp sounding cd. The sound here is tainted...even when you turn it up. I would think there are better Asia greatest hits out there."
3,I was never a dedicated fan.,"I only really remembered the main ASIA songs that I heard on the radio. I liked what I heard of them but I didn't hear a lot from them. I thought I'd buy their Greatest Hits to get the ones I remembered and basically sample some of the ones I've never heard of. In the end, the ones I remembered were the best on the CD. The others are a little forgettable in my opinion. Again, I was never a dedicated fan."
4,I guess it was their time,"Yeah, most of us are grumbling about the shortened tracks on the cd itself. I think many of you already have the original albums, and are getting this for the songs that aren't on there, like I am. Yeah, I have all three singles on vinyl, but since I don't have a turntable anymore, I can't listen to the b-sides anymore. It was good to get them on digital format though.I think they were better served killing one of the tracks, and having the other tracks to their full length. But, no big deal. I also never got Astra or Then and Now on cd, so those tracks for me are bonuses."
4,Should we be ashamed to own this!?,"Last year I saw the movie ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and the band Asia and one of their songs were sort of a running joke in the movie. The lead character was harangued by his friends for having an Asia poster in his apartment. I was like, ""Hey, what's wrong with Asia? I used to have one of their records!"" I remember when Asia was pretty cool, but I guess now they are looked at with a laugh (as are many of the bands from the 80's). No matter, the music is still great. Certainly a lot better than some of the cuff-me-beat-me death metal on the radio today. Buy the CD, you won't be disappointed."
3,Are You Kidding Me? This is Asia We're Talking About...,What's with all the four and five stars for an Asia CD? Is this the Asia Groupie Convention camped out here on Amazon? I'm being generous here with three stars. This was a band of talented musicians who faded fast after their successful debut album. The critics weren't too thrilled with them for a reason: their material was mediocre. There's nothing earth shattering or groundbreaking here. If you're not familiar with the band borrow a cd from someone before you waste your money for two or three good songs.
2,In The Heat of Nausea,"Hard to believe that these same guys were part of King Crimson,Emerson Lake and Palmer and Yes. An 80's supergroup made up of castaways from progressive rocks finest? The trouble is everything here is quite predictable and 80's and really not that good. It is Arena Rock nearing the end of it's reign and thank god that it's over...."
2,Where's The Beef?,"The producers missed the mark on this CD. First mistake, editing down ""Sole Survivor"" and Shaving 2:10 off ""Here Comes The Feeling to save some time. Obviously, they did not care about ASIA fans. The remastered sound quality is not up to par with other techinques such as Sony's 22 bit digital transfers. This could have been a great set if they would have made it a double CD package. First include the first ASIA album uncut and remastered to higher standards. Second, include the acoustic sets from the live albums and then the the B-sides and other tunes from the other albums. The bright side of the CD is songs like ""Ride Easy"" and ""Daylight"". Once again ASIA fans are left wanting more."
4,Sounds good,"Apparently, this model has changed. The model number is the same, but it is now 5 x 13 x 4 inches (which worked out better for me). It now has two 3-1/8 "" woofers with 7/8 inch tweeters instead of the quad 2.5 inchers. It is still rated at 120 watts and sounds good."
4,Great sound in a little package,The great thing about this speaker is the size. Produces great dynamic range for such a compact center. This speaker can also be used / hung sideways as a side wall surround speaker. If you have 7.1 channel you may want to pick up 3!
4,Clear + Crisp,"Good clear tight sound & affordable.It also greatly depends on your receiver, but if you're a fellow audiophile nut, this center channel speaker is a fantastic purchase to fill that center gap."
4,Good for the money,Let me start by saying that any decent home theater needs a good center channel speaker. Don't skimp on the center. This is a good starter center or for a smaller room.It is fair for the money. It allows for bannana plugs and it has a nice piano finish. I bought this model due to size requirements and as a result of brand reputation. It offers decent sound but will distort at higher sound levels. I don't think you can beat it for the money!
4,"one of My ""boys"" bought this for Me and...","one of My ""boys"" bought this item for Me, and well while is does clean your body well, it does not have enough scent added to it, you can smell the scent on the bar itself but not when used. I did HOWEVER love the fact you recieve a personal hand written note from Danielle and She did include 2 other bars of different scents for Me to try... I can't wait to try the candy cane one... thanks Danielle!"
3,crazy . . . . like a horse,"good grief charlie brown, when will someone re-release our favorite Osmond albums on cd. phase lll, and crazy horses ????so many re-issues of the same old top 40 hits, certainly there is a market for those unheard songs included on these 2 yet unavailable albums. i mean, if they can re-issue the partridge family albums and for pete's sake some fool named p-diddy actually makes cd's certainly something this worthy deserves released."
5,This is current day Osmond Brothers singing old hits,"This CD is excellent. I am not sure when it was recorded, but it is the modern day Osmond Brothers singing their old hits and doing a darn good job of it... A little cheesy for Mike Curb to stick in an old recording (song) off their 80's country album, etc... The music is up to date. It's a must have for Osmond fans!"
5,The mature Osmonds,"This is an honest review where yes, this album is the hits rerecorded by the Osmonds. This is how you would hear them if you saw them in person, and enjoy them differently. Those of you who are looking for the original recordings, they are available and say all original recordings. There is need no need to put down Mike Curb for releasing a product for fans that they may enjoy. I, as a lifelong Osmond fan, enjoy these new recordings, and listen with an open mind. Simply, you will either like it or not. Thank You Osmond for keeping this music fresh. Enjoy and Stay 2nd :-)"
5,Simple Feline Diabetes Test,"This is a terriffic way to confirm a tentative diagnosis of diabetes in a cat without the trauma of taking your cat to the vet or trying to hold a strip to them while urinating. You sprinkle some sugar-detecting ""confetti"" in the litter box and check it each day for color change. In our Simba, we confirmed high blood sugar and immediately took her off her existing kibble diet (kibbles are generally high in carbohydrates as well as grain products such as flour and gluten that cats and dogs can't metabolize). She now eats only high-protein grain-free canned food and is symptom free. I highly recommend this product.Purina ""Glucotest"" Feline Urinary Glucose Detection System (one test packet)"
5,Glucotest for management of feline diabetes,"Purina Glucotest is a wonderful product to use, in conjunction with veterinary monitoring, to manage feline diabetes. My cat has been diabetic for 2 months, & is now getting better, because I have this product to use. It came quickly & worked very well for us. I have ordered at least 10 packets, and all of them worked well. Thank you Purina!!"
3,Diabetic or Not??,This is the first time I ever used this product but cant make up my mind if its helped determine if my cat is diabetic or not. I followed the directions but the results seemed inconclusive. Will be taking my cat to the vet. Id say take the money you wouldve spent on this and use it toward a vet and tests.
4,Saved my kitten from more blood tests,"You need to use a whole packet of the Glucotest at a time, and check the litter 2-3 times per day to assure accuracy. Outside factors may have caused a faulty result from an earlier blood test for our kitten, but the test confetti did NOT turn colors. We are comfortable that our kitten is diabetes free, without subjecting him to more blood tests. Works great!"
5,Purina glucose test strips area blessing,"OMG...I don't know what I would do without these strips....It's cheaper than going to the vets a few times a week, which I was doing. It's less stressful than pricking the ear vein with a people meter which is NOT calabrated the same for a cat. I monitor the test strips 24 hours a day as I take my cat to work with me...and I get up every 3 hours to check his levels.I am not changing what works...This is a miracle product. Donna Fenza- Sea Isle City, NJ"
5,"Vanished Hands, Maybe, But No Vanished Stars!","This is my first book by Wilson and I am very impressed. He is one of those few thriller writers who relies on good old fashioned WRITING. No cheap tricks, no serendipitous coincidences, no whiz-bang save-the-world with only seconds to go. No, Robert Wilson takes his time, develops his characters, unravels his complicated plot, leavens each page with great wordsmithing and, in so doing, presents the reader with a treasure. This book, however, is not perfect. There are so many characters that he thoughtfully provides a cast of characters at the end of the book. And the pacing of the novel bogs down right at the outset, but like a big train engine, the novel rolls down the tracks, gaining momentum that, by the end of the book, seems unstoppable. I liked this book because it was a good read and it didn't insult my intelligence."
4,An intriguing story,"After having been very disappointed with Robert Wilson's ""A Small Death in Lisbon,"" I really enjoyed reading ""The Vanished Hands."" It is a psychological murder mystery, set in a sizzling hot Summer in Seville, Spain. The book is well written, with intriguing, mostly believable characters. Once you get into it, it is hard to put down. I highly recommend it."
4,again a novel about paedophilia,"the start is very promising, and I couldn't let the book down. Great police work. But towards the end, it was found the bad guys were in a paedophile ring with political connections, and nobody could touch them. So overly used in detective novels, so boring, it seems that the author didn't know what to use as a mobile for all those deaths. The end was like a wet cracker. But overall, a good detective novel."
3,Light enjoyable read,"I think Essie Summers died this past September. Please correct me if I am wrong.This book is not as textured as her earlier ones. Yet it is a gentle idealistic story. Her leads seem removed from this generation. Characters from previous books are mentioned, one even makes an appearence. It was a nice nostalgic moment.Summers wrote literate romances, she peppered her stories with poetry and prose from various sources. She shared her love of her native New Zealand as well. She also shared her deep spiritual believes in what I consider an unobtrusive manner. I am an atheist, yet felt comfortable enough with the characters deep religious beliefs. Possibly because Summers was comfortable with her beliefs so didn't force them upon the reader.She clearly is/was a talented writer who writes intelligent romances with men who don't behave as boors and women who possess depth.If I am correct and Summers is dead, she will be missed by many readers."
4,Easy to understand information,"This is a very good beginning book on the subject for children. It begins with scientific information about how earthquakes occur, and then goes through what may happen during an earthquake, such as buildings falling down, fires, gas leaks, etc. It goes into further particulars, such as how it feels to be in an earthquake, and what safety measures to take.The illustrations are very simple, and not especially appealing, but they do help illustrate the points well.All in all, a good book for children ages 8 -12 who live in earthquake prone areas, especially."
1,The foolproof guide to wasting $19.95,"There is nothing in this book that will really help a guy to meet or keep a woman, unless he has been living in a cave for the past 50 years and has absolutely no common sense. It's basic crap like have clean fingernails, keep wine in your apartment, yadayadayada...If you do some of the stuff brodsky reccomends you might look like a loony or worse a stalker. Buy Nice Guys and Players for better info. Also check out the seducingwomen101.com for the real truth about women written by a women. Brodsky must need some cash to write this piece of drivel."
5,current favorite,"I saw the movie several years ago and remembered the beautiful soundtrack (I usually never notice those kinds of details) but forgot about it -- till recently a friend just watched the movie and it reminded me to get the soundtrack. I have been listening to it non-stop since - and now my husband is hooked too! Listening to it makes me so happy and lighthearted, changes my outlook even if I'm grumpy. Makes me hopeful and want to dance in the sunshine. If you love beautiful music that stirs something deep within, while keeping things light -- get this CD, I can't rave enough about it."
2,Fingers too short!,"These gloves are very soft and seem to be made well, but they have a big flaw: the fingers are too short. Ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems."
1,Size is the issue,"These are marvelous feeling gloves - supple and soft - but they are impossible to fit. The small is WAY too small and short fingered, but the medium is WAY too big and long fingered, and I tried four or five different pair. I will say the merchant was very tolerant of me, with multiple shipping charges absorbed by him, and at one time I had three pair in my possession trying to get something to fit, but eventually I had to bail and ask for a credit to my account."
3,Not the greatest fit and quality,I ordered a small. Very small and seams have already come undone in certain areas. It does look great though. They definitely stick out in the unique look factor
3,Where's the real small?,"Small is REALLY small. fingers are to short, can hardly get my hands in them, and yes I wear a size 8 shoe and my hands as measured are supposed to fit. I then ordered the medium and the fingers are much longer and the glove is what I would call a relaxed fit. Somewhere in between is the real small? The glove quality is excellent and the leather is extremly soft. Whould have rated them a 5 if I could get a decent fit."
3,ok book,"I expected more, but this is a small, short book with not a lot of details of the site. Dr Hawass writes great books, but this is not one of his best, just ok.It could be better if the book was larger, with more photos and details of the site."
1,Disappointing,"This is a look at a REHEARSAL of the Ring from the vantage point of the stage hands. It would have been much better with footage during an actual performance. Most of the comments and comedic moments seem feigned. It's probably worth one viewing, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,A WORD OF DISSENT!,"I am truly amazed that the folks who have written such positive reviews of this DVD enjoyed it so much. But as someone who bought SING FASTER entirely on their recommendations, may I warn any prospective buyers that this DVD falls somewhere between the level of back-stage ""home-movies"" and a one hour Reality Show consisting of stage-hands playing cards and watching TV during tech rehearsals of THE RING. If either of these things sounds ""hilarious"" to you [or worth $24!], go for it. But I would suggest renting it on Netflix before parting with your hard-earned dollars. But I agree that - if you enjoy opera - yes, you should own Anna Russell's CD and/or her FAREWELL CONCERT DVD (which includes a live performance of her wonderful 'Condensed RING')!"
4,"Functional, solidly built set","I got this socket set primarily because I needed some deep socket wrenches for my car. The fact that it also includes a spark plug socket and 3"" and 6"" 3/8 extensions were a bonus. The case is solid plastic and well-formed so the tools don't rattle around inside. This is a better socket set than two sets I bought from Home Depot."
3,Fun movies,"Okay, I'll admit my secret pleasure is watching films that destroy the world. The combo of 'Day of Destruction: Category 6' and '10.5' follow the usual plots of these types of movie. However, I love how in '10.5', despite everyone's best efforts, the earthquake happens and the US loses most of southern California. I find that a far more realistic approach than the norm of : humans win out over nature. It adds to the delusion we can do anything about climate change. We can't. in the sequel to '10.5' the best line is : 'The Earth will do what it wants'."
4,USPC Longeing book,Another good book from the Pony Club. A nice short but comprehensive guide to working on ground work and longeing that is written so that it is easy to understand even by kids.
5,Very happy,Got the items quickly and exactly what I ordered at a fraction of the price I would have paid at a walk in store.
1,Defective,After receiving these I replaced the black in our printer. After trying to print a test page the printers display said the cartridge was empty. I took the cartridge out and sure enough it was empty. When I put it in the printer it was full. Upon closer inspection I saw that all of the black ink had leaked out and drained to the bottom of the printer. It was such a mess I ended up throwing the printer away. Not a good experience for me.
2,Not pleased,"I am always a bit hesitant when the price is too good to be true, but tried it anyway. Several cartridges arrived damaged (two were leaking and had to be thrown in the garbage). The colors are not true and my printer spews out some very odd looking prints.Not happy at all."
1,Get what you pay for,The product description stated that these cartridges were compatible with my MFC-210C. If they were than they must have been filled with invisible ink. An 8 pack for only $4.92? I should have known it was too good to be true. And so should you. Stay away.
2,Don't do it unless you really can't afford anything else,"I thought I'd cheap out, but this is killing me in the wasted paper and wasting my other more expensive inks. I ran out of my old black first. Popped in one of these cartridges and it worked fine the first time, but that's it. Now I have to open the printer, re-seat the cartridge, and let it clean itself, every time I print. When I forget to do this, every color prints but the black (the other colors are still my old brother inks). Thus, I loose paper (since the print outs are incomplete) and I loose the other inks. I'm going to see if I can return what's left."
1,sucked,was not happy with this product at all. It did not work well with my printer at all. My printer could not register all the colors at the same time.
4,A great substitute,"The purpose of my printing is for lecture notes and journal articles off the internet. IT is fine for this type of work. I have had to use it for coping papers, and that is fine. For official documents, I personally would not use it. For most everyday purposes, it is good substitute. This is my second order from this company and I have no complaints."
1,Horrible...,"I tried to save some money over OEM parts, but it's not worth it. The print quality is horrible with these. They cause random streaking all over the page. Do not waste your money."
4,Very Good,"This was a great value, good quality, and came very quickly. The box was slightly damaged, but the product was not."
3,Customer service is great. But...,The brother cartridges are very poor. dont fit in the slot quite right and are not printing anything above a 10 font size.
3,Mostly just a hotel guide,I was hoping this book would have more ideas about what children would love to do and see in Italy. This is mostly a hotel guide.
1,Do Not Buy This Book,This is a truly awful book and will not assist you in planning a trip to Italy with your children. Unless you are interested in the personal exploits of two traveling chiropractors and their children with unbelievably dated and limited reviews I would strongly advise you to avoid this book. There are many other Italy with kids travel guides which will serve you well this one will not. This is the first book I have bought from Amazon that I have truly considered returning as it is useless and not a good read. I repeat its AWFUL
4,title a misnomer,"This is a great look inside the workings of a ""big gun"" battleship during World War II. While only one chapter is dedicated to the Battle of Surigao Strait, Howard Sauer speaks from his experience as an officer in the gunnery department. He includes a map of the action, with postitions of combatants noted, in addition to firing tracks. His detailed look at life aboard the USS Maryland is helped with pictures, diagrams, and maps. The book is a valuable resource for anyone wanting to know about life aboard a battleship during war. Another feature of this book is the directory of all United States battleships."
3,straight-foward,"written by a non-literary type, the book is in a straight-foward manner with no diversions, not even for the dead. It is the history of the WW11 battleship ""Maryland"". One of the ancient ships raised from the mud of Pearl. For a flavor of WW11 sea battles it serves a purpose. It is as advertised, ""An eyewitness account""."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product and quit using it after less than a week. Although the photo shows the screen as clear, the actual product has a (in this case) purple silicon skin over the screen, so the image is blurry and hard to read."
3,Not worth it,The material covered here is topical at best and is somewhat onesided on the true history of witchcraft. A good one time watch but not something I would deem necessary for my library.
4,THE RIVER FLOWS SMOOTHLY,A great first effort. The lyrics are thoughtful and often quite moving. Several songs have catchy refrains that will keep you humming.
5,Adidas Men's Pro Intimidate Turf Low,"Very comfortable, durable! Just as described! Recommend this shoe to anyone who plays on turf!"
1,"WARNING! Keebler announced ""precationary hold"" for Salmonella!","I recieved an email from the FDA stating that Keebler has placed a ""precautionary hold"" on these crackers because of the salmonella outbreak associated with peanut butter. You can look up the info on Keebler's website."
1,Just Shoot Me!,"The title indicates a genre populated by movies such as ""Armageddon"" (seriously funny Bruce Willis) or ""Deep Impact"" (straight to the end of the World - almost). Well, only the title could indicate quality. The characters are cast in a grey, two-dimensional plot which offers nothing but repeated yawns. I actually didn't manage to view through in one night. As for technical quality on DVD: Forget it!"
1,ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH,"I am a huge Sandra Berhard fan, but honey, this is the worst movie ever! Sandra is terribly miscast as a spaceship captain, and Laura San Giacomo is a horrible mess as a Shakespeare crazed computer terrorist. This is blackmail material for all involved!"
2,Crunch review,"This video is not very user friendly. If you're used to the stylings of Jane Fonda, you won't love this video. There isn't much cardio and the beginning warm up is very hard to follow. I recommend doing 20 minutes of cardio before doing the exercises in this video. The video alone won't leave you feeling very tired. The ab exercises are great, but without any cardio they won't get you very far. There are cheesy sayings between each section and the video doesn't tell you when you need to get a mat like Jane does. Personally, I would stick with Jane Fonda's abs and thighs videos. I can't speak for what kind of results you get using one versus the other, but Jane's videos give you a great workout and are much easier to follow."
5,VERY EFFECTIVE,"I am a fitness instructor, teaching kickboxing, Cycling and Step. I work my abs every day and have a hard time feeling my ab workout the next day. I actually bought this tape about a year ago and just hadn't had time to use it. Recently, I have incorporated it into my workout routine and absolutely love it. The moves are basic, but if you focus on how the instructor tells you to perform the move, you will really see results. I like the fact that she keeps reinforcing ""navel into the spine."" That makes all the difference in the world. If you use proper form, you will definitely see results. I have really seen a difference in the ""definition"" in my abs and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in getting those ""Washboard Abs."""
2,Way to easy!,This has to be one of the easiest videos I have ever done. It was far to simple for me to even get a good workout from it. I did it once and I gave it to my mother. If you want a good abs video try an Abs of Steel tape or Keli Roberts Abs and More. These will give you a workout!
1,Don't waste your money,This is without a doubt the easiest video I have ever done. I did it one time and then gave it to my mother. The workout is far to simple for someone at even a low intermediate range. I did the whole workout without feeling a burn once. I was in the low intermediate range when I bought this video. I recommend Kathy Ireland's Absolutely Fit for a better quality and workout.
4,Cheap and simple,The only thing easier would be if the person who broke the mirror had bought it and replaced it himself. Follow through would be nice James Michael Emond.
4,replace mirror glass,"Exact fit replacement. Super easy to install with double stick tape, just like the original mounting. The reflection is clear as a the factory mirror, no wavy reflected image."
3,"A great set, but CD 1 isn't so hot","Okay, now a lot of people call this such an amazing set. Well, I gave it three stars and here is why.I really had to nail this one because of CD 1. It starts off really, really poorly. I had high hopes for a cool Garbage ""When I Grow Up"" remix, but this just wasn't it -- it was slow! Not as cool as I'd hoped. Now granted a slowed mix of a song can be cool, but this just didn't do it for me as Track 1. But what really irritated me more than anything was their inclusion of Fatboy Slim's ""Praise You""; it does not even remotely resemble a remix, it is just throw in there! COMPLETELY silly inclusion if you ask me, and as big of a fan of Slimbo that I am, I always skip the first couple tracks, because they reallly do not belong. I certainly hope they didn't just throw this track in to try to draw Fatboy Slim fans; it is not nearly his best work and like I said before, completely disconcerting.Of course, throw on CD 2 and you will forget everything; it rules.Later... Mike"
5,It's all about cycles,"This book was written 9 years ago, but it could have been talking about 2003. Having just lived through a massive coporate ""optimization"" and seeing my friends become the ""attrits"" (those impacted by the attrition) I found myself thinking ""yes...exactly...that's right"" on every page. These stupid euphemisms have found their way back into our corporate vocabulary - they were ridiculed in this book in 1995, and are just as ridiculous today. With a few minor updates, this book needs to be re-published. It is brilliant."
4,Another good early Sabatini,"Sabatini is in his element here: renaissance Italy, treachery, and the long shadow of Cesare Borgia. The plot gets quite gripping at the end, but of course both the set-up and the deus ex machina are preposterous. There is actually one point of subtlety in the characterization of the protagonist, which I won't spoil; see if you can spot it..."
3,For nostalgia purpose only,"I was into jpop in late 80 to early 90s in my younger days, and was a fan of Sukeban Deka series.If one sees this film at this day of age, it's pretty laughable - as they really can't act - but it left me laughing all the way the end with silly grin and nostalgia of my youth."
2,On a short list..,"This is one of only 2 books that I lost interest in finishing to the point where they were put down. I had bought it, read probably half of it, and consciously decided to not bother finishing it. I don't even remember what it was that turned me off, but it still sticks out in my memory."
1,Disappointing,"I was going to give this as a gift but now I'm too embarrassed to gift it at all because these books are horrible! Boring, repetitive, and not funny. The humor is supposed to be in the responses, not the forced kind that is displayed in the writer's letters. I would not recommend these, even to my enemies."
5,Simple Comedy,"Having already read Ted L. Nancy's first volume, I was more than excited to read more outrageous letters. Similar to the Laszlo Letters (but much better), Ted L. Nancy writes zany letters to all sorts of organizations (companies, governments, the military, hotels and more) to make his hilarious requests. Though they are, of course, outlandish, but that's the entertainment.Equally as entertaining are some of the response letters. Because most aren't totally sure that Ted L. Nancy is fake, they have to diplomatically word their letters -- great stuff.Jerry Seinfeld has written the forward to both books by Nancy, causing many to speculate that he is the real author. Check out the wikipedia page on Ted Nancy for more details, but I'm not completely convinced that Seinfeld is the real author. Nevertheless, More Letters From a Nut continues the great tradition from before, and also makes for great comedy when read aloud. Enjoy it!"
5,Best ff8 GUIDE ever!!!,"this guide basically tells you every little detail a person can ask for. It has a section for items, enemies, weapons, SECRETS, the guide itself, character profiles and every single draw point there is. Included are some very helpful hints that can help you defeat bosses and such. but what i enjoy most about this guide is its organization. everything is easy to find and not scattered everywhere. you wont find a piece of info your looking for in a misplaced area. highly organized and highly recommended. plus it makes a good collectors item. thats also one of the main reasons i bought this.In conclusion, very organized and helpful. so if your looking for a guide for ff8 this is your best bet!"
3,Less than it seemed.,"A nice little book, over-priced in my opinion, with little that was new for the Romanov fan. It seemed to offer new insights and pictures, but on the whole nothing really worth the asking price."
1,t never came!,"It is difficult to review a book that one ordered, but which never came! The review needs to be about the supplier."
5,Amazing,This glove has been amazing thus far. It's been breaking in very quickly and I feel like i have the best mit on the field!
5,fun toy,"My 6 yo purchased this himself with birthday money. I was a very cute toy, it works very well, and so far has held up to my 3 (very active) boys. They really like it, and take turns sitting on the little cushion (think blow up bean bag) and throw the balls at the target, which goes down very easily. Then the water sprays out onto the cushion, very gently. If they prefer to just play in the water, then you just leave the target down, it will continue to spray. I was very surprised at how well this did work. They really love it."
5,Fun summer toy,"I ordered this for my 4 year old, and 11 year old. It arrived the next day!! They have had a blast with it, it works very well. It's a bargain at (...) and free shipping. Your kids will love it."
4,Fun for the whole family,"My son and husband loved this. They're both into baseball and liked the challenge of trying to hit the target. It's great during the hot summer days, and at $10, it's a great deal. My only gripe is that when the ball hits the target, sometimes the little pole the target sits on comes off the lower part of the doohicky that makes the water spring forth.To play the game effectively, you need at least 3 people: 1 to sit in the chair (which can hold a full grown man child), another to throw balls at the target, and a third to act as catcher. Then, everyone rotates after throwing 4 times each.And if you don't like it, you can give it to the kids next door."
3,Cast Iron cooking,Not worth the money!!! Very disappointing! The recipes were not interesting or anything I wanted to cook in my cast iron cookware. I was looking for real southern cast iron cooking recipes.
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed to find out that the recipes in this book are very sugary and satly due to using processed foods as ingredients such as cans of soda pop, cans of soup (tomato, cream of mushroom), or boxed ""broccoli and cheese rice mix"", and boxed yellow cake mix or frozen concentrated OJ..... There were a few recipes that seemed okay like the classics: beef stew, but the majority of it doesn't seem worthy of slow cooked camp food."
3,"Not really ""ancestor"" cooking","The last sentence in the introduction says something along the lines of ""now let's cook like our ancestors!"" I'd estimate half the recipes in here call for refridgerated dough or boxed cake mix. Two things I don't eat and one I can't take with me to camp! The small section on breads was good as those were from scratch but be prepared for lots of mixes, cannded items and more convenience cooking than traditional ancestory fare.Many of the recipes were ""brown this, add that on top"" which I could figure out myself. I bought this because the mixed reviews were unconclusive. The three stars come from the begining care guide and the bread section. Almost all the rest of the book is ""meh"" at best."
2,Dutch Oven Cookbook,Bought this for my husband as a gift. He really thought the book was only OK. Did not have very much information about cooking in the kitchen. Was mostly about using the Dutch oven while camping. We do not camp out.
3,Close,"Don't even try to figure out the plot of this movie. Makes no sense, and nobody cares anyway.Now for what you care about...For starters, this is the most explicit Torchlight release that I've ever seen: very realistic sex scenes, more female exposure ""down there"" than what these movies normally have. The cast also is more attractive than most.So all of these things are good, and I would have given it four stars EXCEPT:--I don't know who the blonde is--the lead female character--but the director missed a golden opportunity here by never really showing her from THE BACK. Without a doubt this is her best side, and we never see it. Big marks off.--The editing is at times horrible; several times the patches that female actresses wear to cover up their goods in these movies are visible. AWFUL!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I just got this CD at a concert featuring Stephen Pearcy, LA Guns & WASP. I wondered why his entire set consisted of RATT songs and had no tunes from this CD until I heard the CD. It's pretty disappointing. The songs are very rough, the vocals are terrible, the production stinks. You'd never know this came from a guy who'd been to the top of the charts - it sounds like a home made garage band demo."
3,Not as good as Social Intercourse,"The stand out tracks for me were Drive With Me, Godsmack, and Gambler's and Thieves. Didn't really need another version of Round and Round. I liked the previous Pearcy solo cd Social Intercouse more. This one does come with a video for Drive With Me which is pretty cool."
4,"Pretty good, MAN!","This CD is a good by metal standards, but be warned: don't expect RATT, because that is not what Fueler sounds like. It has some elements of Ratt, but more hardcore on the metal scale. The songs are pretty good, especially when pumpin' iron. My favorites are Drive with Me, Kill Kitty, and Overdrive. I saw Pearcy performing at American Metal Blast with WASP and L.A. Guns and he opened with the song Overdrive, so I had to buy this CD. Another good song is Gamblers and Theives, which contains references to a bunch of Ratt songs. Pearcy cleverly uses titles of songs like ""Between the Eyes"" and ""Back for More"".The only downside of the album, dispite driving beats and nice riffs, is that Pearcy's vocals are really rough on some of the songs. It's not exactly rap metal, but its a far from hair metal.P.S. The CD includes a music video for DRIVE WITH ME that you can watch for free on Stephen Pearcy's website. Oh well..."
1,Is this a joke?,"What in the world!?! This album is complete garbage. I'll be chucking it in the dumpster right when I'm done with this review. Stephen Pearcy has a cool voice and Ratt was a talented band. But to any would-be-listener who expects melody or quality musicianship, be warned: Besides ""Gambler & Thieves,"" there is NONE to be found on this album. Ironically, the production represents that of a garage band that would have been booed off stage or pelted with eggs had they toured with the likes of Ratt or Dokken back in the 1980s. How can anybody produce something that sounds this awful and yet have the nerve to sell it? I realize that music is a matter of taste. So with that said, if you like poor productions, grungy sounding guitars, and the almost complete lack of melody... then this album may be for you. But those who like harmony, melody, skillful guitar, and a quality production--look elsewhere."
4,Fueler is a different kind of rocker from Pearcy,"I just picked up Fueler being a fan of Pearcy and RATT and i must say i did like it even though it sounds nothing like Ratt and more so like the industrial feel of Rob Zombie or Brutal Planet era Alice.It has some really cool rockers like ""Overdrive"" which sounds great blasting through my car stereo and ""Godsmack"" another killer cut.Like i said dont expect any Ratt here just new school Pearcy which is not necessarily a bad thing."
2,Problem knives,"Set looks and feels good, but knives all got rust spots on the blade and 3 of 8 handles have broken off..poor design.."
3,"Great design, but rusts.","This flatware is good looking and feels great in the hand. The teaspoons are rather tiny and the tablespoons shallow, which I can live with, but for some reason the knives, and only the knives, get flecks of rust that do not come off! It's very annoying and noticible. I haven't bothered to contact Bodum, but might."
3,Must have for understanding IMHO,I am trying to work this book on my own outside of a class room setting. So far so good.
1,Terrible Company and Product,"Purchased a new GoVideo DVD Recorder + VCR model VR3930. The instructions for set-up were very confusing and it took many tries before setup was accomplished. While attempting to record off our Sony CamCord,the unit would tape for a certain length of time then would stop completely. Called their service dept and received no help solving problem. When recording DVD's off another DVD Player the 3930 would not play the DVD at times. Some DVD's it would play, others wouldn't. All the DVD's would play on our bedroom DVD player. (Which is not a GOVideo machine)The machine is not very reliable at all. Sometimes it will do what it is designed to do, other times it will not. Customer Service is not very helpful, and lets you know if your outside the 90 day warranty period, the machine is your responsibility. After dealing with this company, I definitely would not buy ANY product from them."
1,Save your money.,"I bought this unit about a year ago and have gotten about 4 DVDs recorded. Even those don't play sometimes. This machine will give you messages that, ""this video is copy protected and cannot be duplicated"", even though it may be a VHS tape that I recorded from my video camera 30 minutes prior. The ""copy protected"" seems to be a favorite excuse for not working. It also indicates everything is working fine; shows the titles, etc., but then gives a message when you attempt to replay that nothing is on the DVD, or it needs to be finalized, or some other reason, however, nothing you do regarding finalization or any other remedies make a difference. Save your money, time, and frustration. Wish there was a zero minus catagory for this useless component. My sister-in-law bought the same unit and has exactly the same problems. Also forget tech support."
1,Worse than worthless,Pros: Fast rewind time on the VCR.Cons: 1. Long start up time 2. DVD recording is very unreliable. I waste a dozen discs for every one that works. Disc errors and other messages appear despite updating with patches. 3. Noisy. 4. Uses quite a bit of power when the machine is turned off. 5. Bad instruction manualDo not buy this product thinking you can record DVDs with it. It will not work. It has turned out to be an expensive DVD/VCR combo.Piece of junk.
1,GoVideo 3930 is Junk,"This unit works for a short time and then starts to reject every type of DVD known to humankind. I successfully transferred a few of my most important VHS tapes to DVD within the first few months that I owned it, and good thing I did, because it quickly died. Now every time I try to copy from VHS to DVD it starts out like it is going to work, but then within 5 minutes or so I get some kind of error message saying that it could not finish recording. Total piece of junk. To confirm my suspicions, I did a search online and found that I was not the only person experiencing this problem. Too bad, because it did a good job at first. Very unhappy with this unit!!"
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this item a couple of years ago. Worked great out of the box. Today I went to record a dvd. It no longer works. I called the customer service number for ""White Glove"" service as noted on the unit. Number has been disconnected. I went to the website and looked through their FAQ - no answer to my problem. I clicked on their email address - it came back undeliverable. I clicked on ""Contact Us"" and all that was there was an address. So, do not look for any type of customer support or service when purchasing any GoVideo product."
3,Good idea but small,This item is great is you are storing a petite woman's shoes oe high heals. I wear a size 12 in mens and the slots cannot hold two shoes. I'd look for something with bigger slots if you are a guy.
1,very disappointed.,"When I got the package, the box was already half opened and thought it was weird. When I opened the box and tried to assemble it, I realized that all 4 wheels as well as 1 screw were missing. Now I have to go through the whole returning process. I wish they check the product more carefully before they ship it."
3,Won't last long!,"I loved the use and the ability to move it about easily from place to place. But, after a short time the canvas at the top ripped and the wooden dowels inside broke. The corners where the wood connects came apart often; I had to glue back together. Neat and cute looking, but not very tough or durable. Better to invest in a piece that can endure more use!"
2,Boring...,"The long title first struck me very impressively. However, as I went on reading the book, I find it frustrating and uninteresting. It's hard to write a book with a boring life (no offense, Mr. McCaws). But rather than diving into how the McCaws from not a nerd, a technologist, or futurist becomes successful, the author tries really hard (but unsuccessful) to make McCaws as a great visionary. If you look at the reference section in the book, you will see that most materials for this book came from newspaper. The author has to admit in his book that McCaws didn't spend much time to be interviewed either. Besides, some readers might find the book funny and silly in a technical point of view. Well, I have a feeling that the author doesn't have much insights on the wireless industry. I just read ""AOL.COM"" before reading this book. And in comparision, this book is really a frustration even though I really want to know more about McCaws, a local well-known family."
5,Terrific book; Insightful and fun,"I loved the book. O. Casey Corr puts a fast paced, complicated life of Craig McCaw into a simple fun readiing, makes you excited, book. It is amazing what one man can accomplish. I recommend this to any one with great dreams in business. I learned more in this book then a semester in college when it comes to real life business tactics."
3,not super enough for this Sonics fan,"This book is just a series of anecdotes that are at times great when he talks about the seasons in question but your eyes begin to glaze over when he talks about his relationships or encounters with famous athletes, politicians, etc. I know there are a series of these ""Tales from..."" books involving various teams in all four major North American sports, but the problem is once you've read one, you've read them all really. I learned some stuff about Moses Malone I did not know and about Spencer Haywood and Bill Russell but other than that it was kind of a big ""so what. ""Loved Slick and that era of the Supes and there is plenty of material in his life for a truly great book. Sadly, this isn't it."
2,"If you like hot peppers, this is your book!","Mirtha Umana-Murray has shared the recipes of three generations of Chileans. They're excellent recipes and you will enjoy the results if you're a ""chile"" pepper fan. However, with my Chilean husband, I have dined in homes and restaurants from the north to the south of Chile, have also dined in many Chilean homes in the United States, and I have never been served a dish with ""heat."" I also own a collection of Chilean cookbooks dating from 1925. I believe that while these recipes are traditions of her Chilean family, they are not often tipically Chilean."
5,really really good.,"i think that this album might even be better than their other album (twilight). The music is really good, at least if you like the style. In one of the songs, the lead harmonizes with herself, which creates a really cool effect.If you have heard any of boa's music and liked it, definately get this album.There is only one available right now, but boa sells them in their website [...]"
5,The Best,"I love Boa, I've been a fan for so long I can't even remember exactly when I learned of the band, but Jasmine Rodgers' voice is fabulous and she has been my favorite singer since I found her. It was thanks to her that I got inspired to learn to play guitar as well.Oh yes, and a lot of people mistake this band as the Korean pop singer BoA, this is obviously NOT her. This band is from England."
1,"No one is looking at you, Monica.","This is the worse song ever! ""All Eyez on Me"" is just a weak remake of ""Pretty Young Thing (P.Y.T)"". All Monica did was change the title and some of the lyrics and everyone thought it was a hit. Hel-lo! The song came out around '83-'84! If you bought this single, you deserve what you get. Thank goodness that it's unavailable at Amazon."
1,"Great Jazz, but not at THAT price!","Don't fall for thaT WAY OVER THE TOP offer price - $4 Million for a CD? (even if it is was double disc ;-)Come on Amazon,check your algorithms..."
4,Author says much that needs to be said but needs an editor,"Kennedy, of course, is faulted by fundamentalists (both Catholic and non-Catholic), for saying up is up and down is down. But their criticism is foolish, and when examined, really unchristian. In this book Kennedy says what is so obvious it should be written in neon: the institutional church (not the real church, the people) has a hang up on sex. It cannot heal this sexual wound because it will not admit it exists. Amen. He is right, absolutely. My only objection is with his writing style. Run-on sentences are the norm. Parenthetical thoughts abound. But read through them. The message is worth the effort."
5,Diocesan Priest for over 40 years,"I am a parish priest and I have taught in seminaries .This book is so needed. It's brave and solid as it addresses the RC theological poverty in the area of sexuality. Kennedy goes for the jugular - ie power and control motivation at the heart of the church's official position , dysfuction and immaturity in the clerical world. John"
2,A book which can only appeal to those who already believe,"Eugene Kennedy has written a heartfelt, impassioned polemic against the Catholic Church's teachings on sexuality. For those who are already troubled by the Church's teachings, Kennedy's rhetorical flourish will seem insightful. For those who wish to think more deeply about the strengths and weaknesses of the Church's teachings, Kennedy offers little of substance. The Church needs to find a way to have an open and healing dialogue between those who accept the Church's teachings and those who do not. Unfortunately, Kennedy's book can only widen the gap between them... which is particularly unfortunate since the book's title suggests that the author recognizes how much we are in need of healing."
2,Huge logical flaw,"This book is well written and holds the readers attention. In it, Kennedy presents a well argued and powerful case. Unfortunately, his argument is deeply flawed. For his thesis to make any sense at all one must assume that Catholic priests are more likely than is the general population to committ acts of sexual abuse.Where is the data? The data that does exist (see Phillip Jenkins of Penn State and Thomas Plante of Stanford U.) suggests exactly the opposite is the case. Despite all the media hoopla priests are, if anything, less likely than the general population to commit sexual abuse of minors. That being the case, how can sexual abuse be the result of the Church's teachings and practices?So, in the final analysis, Mr. Kennedy's book presents an interesting theory which has no objective data supporting it."
3,Some Kindle deficiencies,"I have this paper book, but wanted a copy for my Kindle DX. There are a few versions for the Kindle, but I shelled out a few bucks for the one that said it was optimized for larger readers.Although it reads well, and there are illustrations, the Table of Contents doesn't work. I mean, it is there (you can see it), but it is non-functional. A bit diappointing, since I'll have to tag the locations for the chapters myself.I think Amazon should have a bullet list when selling electronic books that tell you things like this.I'll keep the book anyway, but there was no reason that whoever threw this up there didn't take the time to do it right."
1,No illustrations,"This review is for the kindle edition.Unlike the other reviewer who had no working TOC, but had illustrations, my copy had a functional TOC and NO illustrations. I think the figures and illustrations are essential, and without them the book is worthless."
1,wortheless,"the type set is like a stream of conscious, the preface just runs right in to the first puzzles, and it just goes on from there.most important, this book contains many puzzles that refer to illustrations which are nowhere to be found. makes the thing completely worthless, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,A great free puzzle book,"If I were a math teacher or had kids, this book would be worth good money despite its age. There's a collection of a few hundred math problems, involving money, time, families and other situations. They're good brain teasers.The book doesn't have the greatest formatting for the Kindle. There are a few errors and it lacks a table of contents and proper markup, but it still works well. The only ""downside"" I have is that some of the math puzzles are a bit difficult when older British money was used, when the problem is compounded by the fact that you had to use shillings and pence were used, and you mention that you have a half crown and threepence in order to buy something. It's a little confusing but there's a table of conversions in the beginning."
4,Wasn't really quite sure what I was getting,Thiswas free so what the heck check it out. If you like math you will find this book amusing. No loss
4,my opinion,"it's a great keychain...picture was good, but i wished the clear border was a little more durable. they charged WAY too much for shipping. other than that, its great. thank you!"
4,only non-epson cartridge that stands up to original,"I've tried various brands of replacement cartridges for the Epson 740, and this is the only one that I've deemed worth purchasing."
1,Too bad,"Printing quality was as good or better than 'name' brand. Unfortunately, the cartridge lasted for half as many pages/jobs as the Epson equivalent.I got what I paid for."
3,Poor production techniques hinder this workout,"Overall, the actual workout on this DVD is pretty good. However, there are several factors that keep this DVD from being great:1) Camera changes angles way too often, making it hard to concentrate.2) Background music is annoying and distracting. Keli talks almost constantly, and that combined with the music is just too much.3) Setting is cold and unappealing.4) One of the two background exercisers repeatedly demonstrates improper form, and it's never corrected.I have Keli's Kickbox Bootcamp DVD and it's one of my favorites. Her workouts are better when it's just her, there is no music, and it's filmed in a more home-like setting.I sure am glad I rented this first."
4,My favorite watch!,"I love this watch! It has a nice big face with clear numbers. My grandkids get a kick of me wearing such a fun watch. My only complaint is that the hands are hard to see if they are on Minnie's legs , but what the heck, that is just part of the day."
5,Minnie Mouse Jumbo Watch,"I love this watch! Minnie is cute, and the face of the watch is large and easy to read. The price was good, and the watch is durable."
3,Hebrew a language course 3,"As much as Ora Band 's well thought book has a good structure for vocabulary and grammar,this book is not intended for self study, because there are no answers at the end of the bookfor the set exercises. No one can advance with Hebrew structure or grammar as a self taught manual.I would imagine that Ora's book would really be suited in a classroom situation so thatthe Hebrew teacher would give out the right answers to the excercises.Otherwise the examples of texts and stories are well thought out.Perhaps another edition should be issued for people who would like to do aelf study courses.Hebrew: A Language Course, Level 3"
3,Quite Commendable,"I stumbled upon a copy of 'The chefs' ""Guilty at"" a friend's place and I must say I was quite bowled over, not only by the sheer display of patriotism by this music group, but also by their efforts and creativity in using thier talents and music to put across such a wonderful and important message. And their timing couldn't be more perfect. From the first track; 'Smoke You out' to the worldbeat 'Ijo Oge' ('Let's Dance'), Guilty is undoubltedly worthy of a place in any music loving person's home."
5,This is a very good book for those who love angels!,"If you believe in angels or not it doesn't matter,after you read this book you'll realise some changes in your life and become a more positive person.You'll discover the inner you and you'll feel the lovely angels around yourself and you'll get some help from them to make your life perfect!"
5,Working with the Angels to Create a Better Life!,"Terry Lynn Taylor does a fantastic job of sharing her knowledge of and experience with God's angels, showing her readers how we can all engage in angelic communication. Learn how to connect with the angels for help and assistance in every area of your life- especially spiritual growth. Strengthen your connection with the Divine spiritual realm and learn to love yourself more as you embark on this wonderous journey. A must have book!"
3,Hard to find info on,"The converting hardware is simple to use but once you get beyond that things get a little more complex. To set chapters in the DVD or have the title screen changed and minor issues like are not so simple. Some items are in the help text. But the help text does not actually jive with what is on the screen. Simple solution would be to e mail them to get clarification right... not so--- their contacts points are like the CIA. basically, you bought it now you are on your own to figure it out. oh well, live an learn"
1,Don't risk it,Well I am returning this item because it was defective. Support was non existent (fax a question to support and wait for an answer? I don't think so). I checked the reviews first and thought I wouldn't have issues but this was not the case. The video conversion was poor and things were not as intuitive as I would have thought. DVD burning just did not work. I tried it in my computer after burning (I have a Dimension xps with 2GB Ram) and couldn't play it on my new DVD player either. It's a shame as I couldn't find anything else. It got a good review on CNET or PCmag but I can't see how this could be the case.
4,"Fantastic hardware, editing software lacking","I've been researching analog capture devices for a long time and finally bit the bullet and bought this one. With horror tales about crashes accompanying the reviews for many similar products, I was fearful even after receiving the package. But I needn't have worried. It was simple and worked great. I am loving reliving memories of my son's infancy that were stuck on 9-year-old VHS-C tapes.The capture software was easy to use and very effective for my purposes. But the editing software, which you don't need to install to capture video to your hard drive, doesn't compare to Adobe Premier Elements. If you combine the two products, you get a fantastic package for the money."
1,retired electronics design tech,This item was returned for refund because I ordered the wrong item.This item consisted mostly of cables of which already had plenty.I cannot really say much about this item since I returned it for refund.
2,"Hardware works, software/support is TERRIBLE","The hardware is quite convenient and does a good job of capturing video and stills for my purposes. However, the provided software is flaky and buggy. Also, I recently reformatted my machine and redownloaded the software from the vendor site, but needed two (two!!) different serial numbers to activate the software, both of which were on the original packaging which I had long since misplaced/lost/thrown away. The fact that I actually own the device was meaningless when I contacted their support. So I broke down and purchased different authoring/capture software which works 200% better than theirs, but now my cost for capturing has doubled. There are better solutions out there than this one, particularly given the lack of support/help from Turtle Beach."
1,Don't buy....poor software and no support!!,"This product would not even install on my Windows XP PC, does not pass Windows certification, asks for old Windows files and to make things really bad there is no telephone number listed anywhere in their manual or website for support...buyer beware!!"
1,can not recommend,I have windows vista and this product does not now nor does it plan to be compatable in the future. I tried to use it on a frinds computer and it did not work and was difficult to navigate through.
4,very good for the money,"this video is one of my favorites, some of the hottest actresses are shown in ""pink color"" doing softcore scenes very nice"
3,No ventilation holes as advertised,"This is a very good brand, but when choosing between different styles, I chose this one because of its ventilation holes, but the bandages did not have them."
2,Save Your Money {2.5 Stars},"For the most part, this thing doesn't perform as advertised. Sure it cleans your already functioning discs, but the ability to repair mildly scratched CDs is virtually nonexistant. It's one thing to try and fix deep scratches (the only remedy for that is a new disc), but the surface abrasions and mild scratches will go unchanged. Also, the cleaning pads aren't of very high quality and will tear after just a few uses. With all that said, this thing is great for cleaning already functional discs. I'd only recommend this for that reason alone though."
1,Over-rated,"Can't believe how people rave about this movie. I found it very boring and predictable. Definately, not Vince Vaughn's greatest movie."
1,not a good experience,"I had a bad experience with this phone. Given how cheap it was, I wasn't too surprised.First, it messes with your Windows sound volume settings... I get what it's trying to do, it's trying to be clever - but it just doesn't work. It's a pain.Second, I had all kinds of call quality problems using this phone. Skype's quality is always fine for me, but not with this phone. The range to the base is terrible, and the speaker/mike are of really poor quality. I stopped using this and ordered something different after a week."
4,This is what we wanted!,"For all those who must know just what Lurue or another minor deity looks like, and similar details, this book will answer all your questions about Forgotten Realms deities. The artwork, in most cases, is excellent. Most interesting to me were the descriptions of the major deities' churches and clerics. Holy days can be a very nice focus for adventures, and a reminder to PC clerics of their duties beyond hacking, slashing, and looting. This detail to worldly aspects of worship is what puts Faiths and Pantheons far above Deities and Demigods, though that is also a nice resource. Once again, the cover and page edges tie in this book with other Forgotten Realms sourcebooks. The prestige class section, which at least one was seen in Dragon magazine, has some quality ideas for villains and PCs alike. In conclusion, Faiths and Pantheons makes very clear why religion is such an important part of life in this campaign world."
3,thorough and in depth...to a fault...,"first i'd like to say that i find this book fascinating. the level of detail thats put into everything forgotten realms related has always awed me, and this book is no different. the amount of information on each deity is astounding and has stat blocks down to stats and feats and personality quirks. HOWEVERi cant imagine being in a campaign where 1% of this information would come into play. if you're running a forgotten realms campaign its a good (though not necessary)accessory, otherwise its useless. thats my rationalization for my mediocre rating, being that i run a campaign that exists in a different world, i never have reason to pick it up, and even for a campaign in faerun its not required."
5,A great resource for players,"Not every book is needed to play Dungeons & Dragons, and while you don't need this book, it is one heck of a good supplement. The book gives a great rundown of the pantheons of Faerun and goes into faiths as well, providing players with insights for their characters and gives DM's ideas for campaigns. Definitely has been a great addition to my collection."
3,It had the info I wanted.,"This book is good for getting info for clerics and dm's, or anyone who wants a better ide of the forgottens realms."
2,Mostly rehash and incomplete,"This is by far the worst FR supplement to date. It basically repackages information previously contained in 2nd ed. supplements Faiths and Avatars, Powers and Pantheons, and Demihuman Deities with very little new or additional information. In addition, the demihuman pantheons that are included are dealt with in only a cursory manner. Even worse, many demihuman/monster pantheons are not dealt with at all...."
4,Great book,"I enjoyed this book. I bought a copy because we are taking our students to see a play based on the book this spring. The book is now out of print, but I was able to find a copy on Amazon."
4,a musical tapestry of Asia,"Missa Johnouchi is another brilliant artist from the Pacific Moon label. This CD is a masterful asian recording. Reminds one of wonderful and beautiful asian gardens with an abundance of stone. She creates some subtle sexy and romantic pieces, some introspective ones and some grand ones too."
4,Good CD,"This is a good CD. It's very relaxing and the instrument that the person plays is really cool. However, I do not like this CD as much as Jia Peng Fang's RAINBOW. But this CD is still great. It's a very soothing CD and great background music for dinner or a relaxing bath. Recommended highly. Enjoy!!!!!"
2,Not very impressed,I was not very convinced by this book . Reiki is meant to help all people . Methods done by other practitioners may not be identical to the method you follow . An open mind is part of Reiki practice I believe . We all need to find the method that works for us individually . I am personally still looking for that method .
3,"I received an open item box, but got the refund.","The set should contain 8 games, However I received an open box item, with carry case broken, and 3 games missing."
5,Great workout!,I have had this VHS since it came out on the market. I've used it so much I have parts of the tape that skip a bit. I just got on Amazon in hopes of finding the workout on DVD but with no luck. I'm going to buy a new VHS due to the price but I'd love to get this workout on DVD.
4,Kathy Smith Great Buns & Thighs,"I am a beginner/intermediate stepper. After doing Jane Fonda step aroebics and riding my bike for a week, I still found this step routine to be overly strenuous--you need to be in great shape already to do the workout! So far, I've only been able to do session 1 (warm-up, 8 min.) and 2 (16 minutes). Kathy is easy to follow, pleasant to listen to (unlike Denise Austin), and after feeling the ""burn"" several times, I feel confident that this routine will definitely give you great thighs and buns."
1,"Do not buy a Fill-Rite--Pump broke after 3 uses, Fill Rite didn't help.","Overall, it appears that this pump was poorly made.Initially, when I purchased it in early 2012 it seemed like a bargain. However, by October 2012, the pump seized and the handle snapped off. It could be ween that the handle was a cheap casting (not a forging).Aside from getting set behind in work (after all, when a pump like this is purchased, it is because it is *needed*), I was generally ignored by Fill-Rite. When I called the company, Fill-Rite, they were not any help regarding warranty and indicated that I needed to find out who the distributor was (Although my purchase was from Amazon LLC, the Fill-Rite rep I spoke to said they did not consider Amazon a distributor.If you are looking for a pump, avoid this model. And if this model is an indication of their material quality, avoid Fill-Rite in General. The right tool that lasts may cost a little more, but as the old saying goes, ""buy once--cry once""."
1,Solid *Cast Iron* construction,"I ordered this to use for some water storage barrels, and had to return it. It is a really nice pump, but it isn't made of cast aluminum like the product description says. It is made of cast iron.I'd say 5 stars for the pump itself, but 1 star for the incorrect information."
1,Broke second use,"First use it leaked all over, very poor quality, you get what you pay for. THen I repaired the leaks made some changes and the cast bung adapter snapped right off, now the cast handle has broken . I would put this money towards a better pump, this is a waste of your cash."
2,weak pump,I bought this rotary hand pump to get diesel fuel from an underground tank. The tank is only 6 feet below ground level and the pump does not work. Repeated priming just barely makes the pump work with ferocious rotating of the handle. Wasted my money. Sorry.
4,"Inforrmation - yes, but not qute what I expected","There is quite a bit of information in the book, but not quite the quality I expected. Some pages are faded and the type face is older. It reminds me of a print-at-home book.The actual ideas for trips are good, but they don't line up too much with what we wanted. Very good for all over the country, but I expected more for the alps.One other thing, the trip ideas seem to be arranged geographically, but not always. For instance, I have looked at the 'alps' trips and figured I had the information available. But then I found pieces of information and ideas in other trip suggestions.I also bought the Switzerland Eyewitness Travel Guide and LOVE that book. If you are opting for one book, get the Eyewitness Travel Guide."
1,Book's pages looked like they had been photocopied,"Poor quality of the pages and tours that were not very insightful make this a ""thumbs down"" for me."
2,just OK,"GOT IT FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER, SHE'S 6, SLING WOULD NOT HANG ON HER W/O TRYING TO DIG INTO HER THROAT, VERY UNCOMFORTABLE, DOLL DID INTERACT WITH IT, IN RETROSPECT WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN."
2,Twistie sling carrier!,"This is a cute idea, and a cute design, BUT! It is not realistic! When you put your babydoll inside, it takes a bit, esp. for a child to get the sling hanging around neck correctly and turned right, then, the poor baby doll falls, directly out of it, no back support on it, the only way she stays in is if your hands never leave her! So if the price, which is on sale right now, lures you, I would suggest an older child, rather than , say 3, or so, my 3 year old, doesnt like it, and for her abilities, I dont like it either, but now, my 6 year old, she can do it, when she is being patient enough! Only 2 stars given, for its cuteness and price at the moment, otherwise too difficult and unsupportive to suit my girls:)"
2,A bit too small,I dont think that this should cost 14.99 and the doll cannot fit it properly plus u might want to buy all the pieces for your child i thing they should be a little less expensive cause its so much pieces the doll have and all kids would love them
2,Not as pictured - but a colorful item,"I is a nice item, but it is just NOT LONG enough, not is it deep enough for the baby doll chou chou. It needed to have been at least 3-4 inches deeper so the doll won't fall out and about 2 inches wider. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT THE STRAP IS NOT LONG ENOUGH to go around the body as pictured. It is great for a girl about 3-4 yrs old. The colors are vivid and vibrant. the side bottle pocket is extremently small, the bottle won't even fit and stay.please fix this problem."
2,no no no,"I thought I liked this one (I had only ever done the first few songs as a warm up to my regular workout. Today I played it practically all the way through and I was sooooo bored. Jane tries some acting with this guy that is in the wrong place (the workout meaning) and that you can get over but the lighting it horrible and the ""sunshine arms"" and the ""reach pulls"" are done over and over again. I love most of her other workouts but this one is so bland and tasteless."
4,great way to start a fitness program,"As you sit there in front of your computer, you are probably wondering how to start putting some movement into your life- and quick. This is the way to do it. The moves are interesting but not complex. You notice changes in endurance and flexibility pretty quickly. The stretch is the perfect way to end off too. If you buy one fitness video-as I did, this should be it."
1,Video looked used,"The seller noted that the video tape was new, but it looked used. I am not pleased."
5,Good Upper Body Workout,Great workout because of adding wrist weights. Gives the upper body a real workout. Very easy to keep up with and a great workout in its own right.
4,the film dictionary,it is exactly what i need to help with my classes at the art institute. It is perfect for a student starting in a film class.
4,A great guide for advanced Shotokan Karate students.,"The late Masatoshi Nakayama wrote these ""Best Karate"" series so that all Shotokan students could better understand the role kata played in the art. This volume includes three advanced black belt katas. They include Gojushio Dai, Gojushio Sho and Meikyo. In the Shotokan curriculum these katas are usually not learned until the student has many years of practice. They are challenging katas even for advanced students. Like all the books in this series, the photographs are clear and the techniques shown are done by advanced black belts. It should be emphasized, that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to learn how to perform these katas from the book alone. The value of this book can be best appreciated when it is used in conjunction with actual practice with a Shotokan instructor.Rating: 4 Stars. Very good book. Joseph J. Truncale (Bushi Satori Ryu-Author: Samurai Aerobics, Wakizashi Jutsu)"
5,It saved my slides.,"I;ve got a lot of slides from my younger days. Then technology advanced. No more film...just digital ones and zeros. So, what do you do with hundreds of old slides? Especially when your old slide projector bites the dust. You find a new one on Amazon...and all is well."
4,slide projector,I like the projector- it came in handy for my needs. Only problem there are two slots where the slide always gets stuck. I will have to see if that can be fixed. The projector was delivered very quickly. I was very excited about that since originally it was scheduled to come after my relatives were here. thank you for the promptness.
5,better than anything in print on this subject,"There aren't many books that deal with the effect of divorce on college age and adult children. This book is readable, clear and on-target. It describes (using lots of real life stories) the issues that come up and the pain involved. It gives some practical advice, and shows that there is a way to emerge on the other side.At first I balked at paying $60+ for a used book, but as I've continued to look, I have found nothing that comes close to this one, and I have found some bad books. So it's worth the high price."
5,Marriage Outside Mass,The edition brings spirituality and dignity to the marriage service held outside the Mass. The planning guides allow the couple to focus and reflect and plan the ceremony.
5,for our wedding,We used this book to plan our wedding ceremony. It met all expectations and came in perfect condition.
4,Good tool for preparation,I would highly recommend this book to all who assist people in preparing catholic wedding services.
3,Ok book,We had to buy this book for our wedding ceremony otherwise I wouldn't get this book. There are so many other books that are better then this one.
4,Recommended by a reformed priest...,"GREAT and easy to read. The officiant that is going to marry us recommended this book to me and my fiance. It is what he uses to conduct his weddings. So all we had to do was just go thru and decide which ""version"" and/or readings we wanted read and that was it. Pretty simple. It also has a nice little record keeper in the front in back, so that you can keep track of what is going to be read and when. It also offered really good alternatives for the standard vows."
5,Great Book,"An excellent tool. It covers verb conjugations and tenses well, and the grammar teaching is excellent. It even covers minute grammar points you probably won't find anywhere else."
2,For independent learners - NOT beginners,"I'm sure this will be a great reference for someone who has a good foundation on which to build, but this is not for beginners. It's very confusing from the start and hard to grasp without any experience. I do intend to use it after I have a good foundation, but for now, it's collecting dust on my bookshelf."
5,Bought this to help me improve--- ended up loving it.,This book has been so much help that I couldn't even begin to describe it. I brought this to Spain while I learned Spanish and everyone that I showed it to bought it. They were so envious of it.
1,Not as I had hoped,"I ordered this hoping that I could give it to a highly motivated student in my class and have him go ahead of the class on his own. I did not find it able to meet either my or his expectations.I forgot that I had it, but was able to return it easily---thanks to the generous return policy at Amazon.com."
1,Worst pictures I've ever seen. Total waste of money.,"This book says it's a reproduction of a classic book. If by ""reproduction"" they mean ""crappy photocopied pictures that are really really dark and you can hardly tell what you're looking at"", then yes, this is a reproduction. It literally looks like they went to Kinko's and photocopied the whole book, faxed it to someone, photocopied the fax, then bound it and put it up for sale. I bought this book for our library because it is one of the few books available on this topic. Since the majority of the book is comprised of photographs of buildings and architectural details, it's a big problem that the pictures are terrible. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Lacks detail and analytical depth,"I was very disapointed in this book. It barely scratches the surface. The author refers to her ""research"" a couple of times in the text, however, it seems shallow. A true understanding and explination of the life and times of this controversial woman is seriously lacking. Not only did it lack analytical depth but it took a very biased (pro-Pompadour) approach. Therefore failing to convey the ""Big Picture."" There was no flow to the verse and it seemed disorganized. The author herself must have known this because she makes reference to the difficulty of organizing the life of Pompadour into an easily followed timeline. The pictures chosen do not help to glimpse into the world of Pompadour. While the author describes many portraits of her there is only one or 2 pics of her. None of which the author stated was the best likeness of her. For those wanting an understanding of the life of Pompadour and her world I would not recomend this book."
3,Traditional Cuban Cooking,"This is a small handbook of traditional Cuban recipes that are easy to follow. My family is half cuban so we eat Cuban food at least once a week. I have tried some recipes in this book and they are very good, like the Chicken Fricasse which is classical, the Coconut Flan, the Chicken Rice (Arroz con Pollo). Each chapter of the book is a menu of three or four recipes, the book has no pictures. Good to have if you are looking for reliable and traditional recipes."
1,Still waiting,"I ordered this product in very early January. It took several weeks for the order to be filled and then when it finally was filled, the tape contained the wrong artist. Even though everything (the box and the tape itself) indicated that it was the Fra Angelico VHS tape, it was about another artist. I have been waiting for the replacement item to arrive and it is said to be going out Feb.28th, my fingers are crossed."
5,Fantastic,I bought this and a yamaha 5840 receiver and am very happy with how XM is integrated with the receiver. I would highly recomment this product if you listen to XM at home.
2,Great idea - but sound quality suffers,"I have an XM-ready Onkyo SR-603X, and bought a Connect and Play, since I love XM so much in my car. Setup was easy, I got a signal quickly, but the sound quality is poor. When I listen to DVDs, CDs, my iPod, even FM radio on my Onkyo, they all sound great. XM, however is a big disappointment in sound quality, even though my signal strength is over 80% (70% is recommended). It sounds nowhere near as ""full"" or detailed as I was expecting.Listen before you buy and be careful."
4,Often Overlooked,"Often overlooked in the pantheon of classical music, Granados will emerge as one of the geniuses of 20th Century music. This album is an esquisite rendition of some of his work."
3,"Wonderful, until the singing starts...","Taliesin Orchestra has proven that they are capable of creating gorgeous, haunting harmonies and sounds. Their first album of Enya's work was a beautiful thing. This album...has several lovely pieces, but also several cringe-worthy singers. I'm not sure why they insist on trying to turn Enya's work into a pop-flavored dance mix, but it seems they deliver their best work when they keep their mouths shut. Fortunately, the majority of the tracks are purely instrumental, with only a few minor deviations into the club scene."
3,Not the Best Tribute,"This group has other wonderful albums, and some of those are even Enya tributes, but this one isn't the best. I didn't like the dance-like version of ""Only Time."" Both the singer and music were wrong for that song, so it sounded very incongruous."
5,Translates very well to the battlefield.,"I used the ""Battlefield Guide"" May 18-19 while touring Shiloh, and could not have been more pleased with it. I re-read Sword, Daniel, and McDonough first, and used the Guide in conjunction with the Trailhead Graphics map of the battlefield. The tour stops were aptly detailed and quick & easy to read. I strongly recommend the Guide for anyone planning a walking tour of the Shiloh park."
4,Good. Not exclusively for small children.,This is basically a collection of classical music. Not necessarily just for children. I use this to teach ballet from preschool to middle school.
5,LADY PANK,(sorry za spelling) Naprawde spoko plyta! Nie ma nic wiecej do powiedzenia... Jak biedziecie miec szanse... warto ich zobaczic na zywo.... w Ontario Place w Toronto 18 June. razem z LOMBARD i ELEKTRICZNE GITARY do zobaczenia...! PANK NA ZYCIE>>> ANIA.S. VIVAT POLSKA
5,Perfect,Almost a necessity when cooking with charcoal. The Kingsford Charcoal Starter puts an end to hot coals in the center of your grill and barely lit ones on the edges. It ensures that EVERY briquette is burning hot and evenly.
3,INTERESSANT MAIS COURT,J'ai acheté ce jeu pour mon fils qui a aimé mais le trouve un peu short à jouer. Cela lui a pris trop peu de temps pour parcourir l'ensemble du cd à son got.
3,Good But Very Short,"soon as the game came out i rushed to go buy it.knowing that it would better than its successor.the Game starts of with The Shirogane Clan wanting to take over The 5 Nations by Ressurrecting The Master puppet.the storyline is alright and some of the bosses can be very diffucult at times.but it only has 10 stages after that there are about 38 missions u must complete to get to Kakashi story.Why?? i ask when some of the Missions are boring as hell.now there are some Hidden Characters Like Sasuke,Itachi and Kisame.to get Sasuke u have to beat the Story Mode Twice.Like who wants to go through that again.To get Kisame and itachi you need to beat the Kakashi Gaiden, which you get by beating story mode once and completing all of the missions. You unlock him at the same time as Kisame.(COMPLETEING ALL THE MISSIONS) I SUGGEST U RENT IT"
5,The elusive spirit of Bob Wilson,"I agree very much with Mr. Linders. I recently worked with Bob Wilson at the Watermill Center, although it was undergone many changes since the beautiful photographs were taken. The book is indeed no documentary--it presents more the very spirit of Watermill--the creativity, the inspiration of being in the presence of such a master as Bob Wilson. It's repetative images of ceiling tiles, concrete walls, though at first questionable, quote the very atmosphere of Watermill and it's industrial air--and for one who has experienced it, the beauty of the building's simple architecture, and its history as the birthplace of the telefax machine."
4,Not so bad !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"In French !Entre rien du tout et quelque chose, que faut-il choisir ?Heureusement, on m'a offert ce coffret, car au vu des autres commentaires, j'imaginais l'horreur ! Or, c'est bon ! That's good ! quite good !!!Pearl n'est pas parfait, but !!! Pearl produit en CD des enregistrements introuvables ailleurs !Pourquoi bouder notre plaisir et tre si exigeant ?Si demain la Chorale des Pinsons du Val de Marne produit en CD une pièce introuvable de Mozart... j'achète !Lovers of Sullivan, be happies ! ""Esmerald Isle"" by Pearl is good !!! It could be better, that's sure, but it's good !!! What a music !"
5,Great operetta,"""The Rose of Persia"" is an infrequently performed and recorded operetta. To prepare for a community theater company's production of RoP, I purchased this recording. It was a wonderful help in preparing for my role. Now that the show has closed, I'm looking forward to listening to ""The Emerald Isle"", for me the ""bonus"" operetta of the CD set."
1,multi wave changer,My wave system has just out of the blue refused to read the discs as well. in fact one cd stayed stuck in the multi changer and I had to unscrew the stupid thing to get it out. The other slots will not read the disc.I had been quite happy with it but I give it a ZERO. I paid a lot of money for this thing and have only had it for less than one year.
1,Won't Let CD be Inserted! I hate NO buttons on the machine!,I have experienced the same problem as the rest of the comments. The machine won't allow a CD to be inserted. Troubleshooting at 1-877-210-3782 said to merely uplug - wait one minute and then plug in. Dah! That didn't work. CD goes in about 2 inches and hits a wall of some kind. Told to ship to So. Carolina - pay shipping and approx. $100.00 to repair. To have no buttons on any machine is just plain annoying! What if you misplace the remote! A Really stupid machine. Comments go back to 2009 - why doesn't Bose fix the problem!!!!!
1,Disk problems,"I have had the same problem as many other reviewers; The multi-disk changer has been used sparingly, and suddenly it would not play nor eject CD's. But of course, you can send it in and they will repair it for only about $90, which includes a 1-year warranty. Quite obviously, this is a defect in either the software, or in the mechanical operation. This is very disappointing, considering the $249 price. Don't waste your money."
1,Bose Wave CD Changer will not work.,"I own a the Bose Wave Cd changer that is less than 3 years old and has had minimal use. Several months ago the unit stopped working and displays 'disk error' regardless of which disk I insert, it then refused to eject the disk. The disks check out fine and work in other CD players and the PC. Called Bose support and was told to get a return number and send it in along with $75 for repair. The repair would be warranted for 1 year. I don't want to throw an additional $75 away and I lack confidence in Bose products. I have nothing positive to say about the Bose Wave CD Changer."
1,Awful product.,"I would have given ZERO stars but I could not proceed without giving at least one. System broke down after 6 months, with cds stuck inside unit. My wife had to stop me from using the sledge hammer on it to try to remove the cds (more valuable to me than the Bose system).Third Bose system, same problems. I'm done and I hope I can get my money out of it one last time! Good luck to anyone buying this product after reading this. I wish I could have read this before buying, unfortunately I had to write this)."
1,Should be recalled,"So many of us share the same symptoms. Sometimes I think I'm just unlucky, but the other comments convince me that Bose has a real problem with this item."
2,I'll keep shopping,"I thought I had decided on this system until I read your comments. Now, I'll keeping shopping.. Thank you"
2,Bose Wave CD Changer failure,"My experience is identical to the other three folks regarding the failure of the Bose Wave Multi CD Changer failing within a couple of years of VERY MINIMAL use.In the context of the original price for the unit, $75 plus the $15 UPS shipping fee seemed okay, but; in the context of REALITY it is fairly absurd to think the unit is apparently prone to this obviously design related failure.There are other sites with similar stories, ALL regarding this unit and the identical problem.HELLO BOSE, wake up and take note."
2,Multi-CD Changer malfunction,"My changer also has had minimum use. However, recently I am unable to insert discs in the CD slots. I thought maybe a disc had gotten stuck inside, but the eject button just flashes and nothing comes out. The disc will go in half-way, then seems to hit something that prevents it going in all the way. I have looked on the Bose site to see if there is a troubleshooting area but all I find is a phone number to call. And we all know how much help that can be. Anyone else with this problem and a possible solution?"
1,Piece of Junk,"We experienced exactly the same problem with the changer as described by others. Disc error flashes, discs are stuck in the unit and don't eject even with numerous resetting attempts. Upon contacting Bose we were told the same story - send it in for $75.00 repair plus shipping. When we mentioned that this seems to be a common defect judging by all the complaints on the net, the technician seemed to be ""ignorant"" of this fact - great acting job. This is not to say that he wasn't polite and is probably told not to admit that this unit has major problems.I love my bose radio with the one-slot CD changer, but advise everybody to stay away from the changer. The glowing reviews are most likely from new owners that just received the changer and haven't experienced these problems yet - believe me - you will!"
1,"Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful.....","My experience is exactly the same as the other reviewers. After only 15 months and minimal use, the 3 CD changer ate two discs and will not eject them. I am not sure I will repair or replace the changer, since I do not know that I want to buy Bose again. Sadly, I had great success with the 5 disc player bought six years ago, and left it with a family member. If you want to play more than one CD, buy something else."
2,Bose multi-CD changer,"Well, I seem to be not alone regarding this product. We don't use ours all that much either and a year ago to this date we sent it in for the grinding noises and the CDs getting stuck, etc. After less than a year it has now done the same thing. I have sent them an e-mail stating how disappointed I am in the product but as of this date I have not heard back. As far as the actual main unit, it works fine and I love it and the sound quality is awesome! Too bad I can't say the same for the changer."
1,Bose Wave Music System Multi CD Changer,"I paid $800 for the Bose wave Music System/Multi CD Changer. The changer holds 3 CDs. Now the changer will not work and the changer was seldom used. It keeps the CDs and then displays ""Disc Error"" and will not eject the CD. If you put a CD in any of the CD slots in the changer, it keeps the CD and will not eject it. Bose will give you a list of procedures to perform that might correct the problem and at the end states that if they do not work;send the changer back to them and they will repair it for $75 plus shipping. You can try all these remedies numerous times but they will not fix the changer and Bose knows it; they know what the problem is. This problem is common on their CD changers. Bose should be made to compensate/and or fix this problem when a consumer has spent this much money on a sound system/changer. I will never buy from them again. It is a rip off and they are getting by with it."
4,Brooding psychological Western,"Glenn Ford plays the son of a former gunfighter ,haunted by his father's reputation and his own inability to come to terms with it .He is himself an expert with a gun and fast on the draw but is trying to live anonymously as a storekeeper in a small frontier town.Enter Broderick Crawford as a swaggering psychopathic bully who wants to build a reputation as the Fastest Gun in the territory .This inevitably brings him into conflict with Ford and the local citizenry virtually force Ford into a gunfight as they exert presure amid accusations of cowardice.It is clear they are as blood lusting as Crawford under their veneer of respectability.Their are thematic links with The Gunfighter and High Noon in this fascinating western which is brilliantly acted by its leads and a bevy of strong supporting players ,who include John Dehner ,Leif Ericson and Noah Beery JuniorExpertly shot in black and white this is a curio not a classic but it is compelling ,literate and engrossing"
1,AmazonPrime Should Know: COLORIZATION = ABOMINATION!,"WARNING to all those who love their black-and-white films! Although not a fan of westerns, I'm a serious fan of Glenn Ford, as well as the black-and-white art form in film. I also prefer VHS tapes. So I checked the description of this film. Yes, black and white. VHS. Good. I purchased the AmazonPrime offering. WHAT A SHOCK to learn that the film is a COLORIZED version! Not blaming the Seller. And I hate to give any Glenn Ford film less than 5 Stars. But AmazonPrime should designate when a film has been ""altered"" with colorization. It's horrible! So Black & White Purists BEWARE: If you order this film, double-check to make sure that you are getting ""The Real Deal"" -- a black and white western starring Glenn Ford (who doesn't really look so great with that orange face, courtesy of the kid-paint-box colorization technique)."
5,excellent quality of a movie,"I would like to thank Amazon for expediting this video to me so quickly. I have been trying to get this movie for a very long time, and i just want to say the quality of the video is excellent considering the movie came out in the early 60's. Thank you for getting it to me so fast. God bless you and keep you.KLC/ Miami,FL."
1,Worst Western ever made,"I can't believe anyone would rate this movie worth five seconds of their time!!!! Broderick Crawford as a fast gun!!!? Good god, I never saw an actor so out of place in any movie. And that name, VINNIE HAROLD!!! Who the heck thought that one up!? My kids and I laugh our heads off every time this movie comes on TV. To us, it's as ridiculous as ""Blazing Saddles"", and might be funnier. As for Glen Ford, an actor I usually like, his performance couldn't be much more overwrought if he tried. I love westerns in general, but this is a real stretch. Horrible movie."
4,Classic Western,This one of my favorite movies all though it is hard to find. I would love to have this movie especially in a colorized version and wide screen. Glen Ford plays the part of a store keeper who puts away his gun for a new begining with his wife. As the story plays out a mean low down killer wanting to make a name played by Brodrick Crawford. The towns people get to talking about how he killed a gun fighter. Some of the men keep going over the story and frustrating Glenn Ford.He then gets agitated and wants people to know he was good and fast with the gun. He does not say to the towns people he has not killed anyone with a gun. GlennFord was known as the fastest draw with a gun in hollywood westerns.
1,POOR QUALITY,"This is a classic movie, But do please avoid this DVD the picture qualityhas to be the worse i have ever seen...bargain basket quality.."
5,Good movie,One of my favorite westerns and nearly impossible to find until now. I searched for 7 years after i saw half of it on TBS. Not even available on netflix. buy it before it disappears again.
4,Works Great,Park Tools always work as described. I use this for bicycle repairs and is always in my tool box. The ergonomic design makes the repairs quicker and more effecient. Highly recommend....
3,Too Big,Ball end allen drivers are usually for the tighter spaces. This thing is way too large for most of those places.
3,Park has no balls,"The product description is misleading. It says: ""Chamfered tips for a precision fit. Hang-card packaging. PK-4238: Bondhus balldriver tip for up to 25 degree angled use."". Now that I received this product I find it does NOT have ball tips (was thinking maybe the ball tips were inside and they could be flipped around). Then, go search for ""PK-4238"" as a separate product - but you won't find it anywhere except pasted in various sales postings for this same product."
4,"Great tool, gets the job done","We have a couple of these puppies at out workshop, i also decided to buy my own for home use. 4,5,6 are the most commonly used hex wrenches on bikes, so this Y-wrench lets you easily switch between all of the three instantaneously. you also have decent control when turning bolts, the leverage is great. the only reason i give it 4 stars is because i found the metal to be a little too soft when used over an extended period of time, such as in the workshop.perfect little companion for the occasional bicycle enthusiast, too heavy for traveling though."
1,Great workout to prepare for,killing Imperialist Americans. Not only can you learn the secrets of Communism that we should all 'fall on our kness and beg to be someday'. Learn how to man an anti-aircraft gun with your new found strength that this video will develop.Also learn how to talk on camera or radio just like Jane did in Hanoi!
4,Great Info,"this book is great. I own the national parks passport and the national parks pass. This is a great companion. Basicly it has info on every place that the NPS owns and runs. Each park has about two pages. The sections are: overview, what to see and do, food lodging and supplies, fees, hours, and regulations, how to get there, and contacts. There isn't a whole lot of info on each park, but it covers the whole country( and US territories). For more info on the parks you can go to nps. and after the dot type gov or go to nationalparks. and after the dot type org , they are both very helpful and informative websites."
2,disappointing,"Maybe I had invalid expectations. This book is a thumbnail - at most - of each National Park. Virtually no photos, no in depth discussions of what to do and see, just the very basic facts. If this is what you need this book delivers, but if you are needing more detail, descriptions, and illustrations, keep shopping."
3,It's definitely a halloween costume,"It fit well, maybe a bit big for a size 10 with a 32C cup. Grommets aren't sewn in very well, so be careful playing with the corset part. I replaced the string that ties up the corset because it was fraying and looked too cheesy.The sleeve cuffs and apron have kind of a eyelet lace on it that I didn't see in the picture. I didn't think it went with the costume and ended up tucking the lace cuffs up the sleeves.The hood is a lot brighter than the corset, more of a cherry red color, rather than maroon, like the picture shows, and clasps with Velcro.It's a decent costume-- not too see-through-- and good if you don't want to show off any leg!It's down to my ankles and I'm 5 feet 5 inches."
3,"Description listed as ""Foldable"", but it is not.","This item is ""collapsible"" and not ""foldable"" as described. It maintains the same footprint. It did not meet my requirements so I returned. Otherwise, Item is of acceptable quality for price point."
4,Perfect gift,"My wife is a crystal gems collector, and this necklace exact accessory for her handmade 3 tier bracelet. Gorgeous!"
5,Worth the Wait,"For those of us who have been nuts about Judy Henske ever since the Folk Era, this new CD is almost unreal. How could anyone sing like that twice in a lifetime? How could any new material measure up to those legendary recordings that can still knock the breath out of a person as thoroughly on the 1000th listening as they did on the first? Yet here she is, the Queen of the Beatniks, miraculously back again, singing with the same power and conviction as always, and the added richness of what she's learned along the way. From the sardonic ""Mad Dog Killer"" to the haunting ""Blue Fortune"" to the kick-butt ""Tin Star"" to the marvelously wry ""Wish I Had My Old Guitar"" and ""Dropped Like a Dime"" ... well, what am I going to do, name 'em all? Let's just say that if you put this 10-track CD on shuffle play and let it play forever, you may eventually go mad but you won't ever be bored. Guaranteed."
5,A very unique and extremely talented woman,"I have this CD and I never tire of listening to it. Judy is very earthy and so creative. She sings about the 'seedier' parts of life and she's so fun. The lyrics are terrific, very easy to understand and you'll probably find yourself singing along loudly. If you get a chance to see her 'live', you'll have the time of your life. Her music is wonderful but she could be a stand-up comic easily. She turns tragedy and heartache into fun. Dropped Like a Dime is a great example of that."
4,"value priced motion lighting, battery life not so good","does its job of turning on when approached from about 6-10 feet away. Because of the opaque white cover, the light is dimmer than you would expect. there are 4 led bulbs inside that turn on. Unfortunately, they turn on even in the daytime or in lighted areas so it wastes the battery. In retrospect, I would go for Globe locker lights which only turn on when it is dark, are brighter, and have longer battery life. however these are a lot cheaper and more visually appealling (black and white; the globe locker lights are a terrible green or orange). I put a couple at the front door entrance and in my bathroom and kitchen pantry. Expect the battery to last about 2-4 months. hope this helps"
1,This is the worst poster ever,I don't blame the company at all for this but this poster looks like someone got a wallet sized picture and blew it up without cleaning up the picture. It is very blurry and pixelated and honestly not worth the money.
1,Only useful if you're interested in this author's agenda,"Limited only to author approved, mainstream Christian sects, this book is not useful as an overall guide to those interested in all religious sects."
5,I love this book,"I love this book and have bought it as a present for many special friends one of whom started to use it as a teaching aid for young children learning French. At Christmas, it's a great stocking stuffer. I have a copy on my desk and a few spares in a drawer to give visitors who become enthralled. You don't need to be a cat lover. My own view of cats is that they are a species with what Americans call, 'lots of attitude'. Churchill said that they looked down on all humans whom they consider to be their servants. I have had many in my life and my present cat has more attitude than most."
5,A must have!,This is an absolute must have if you have kids or are one... How amazing to hear how much our Heavenly Father loves us as we listen to an earthly Father sing to his children...
4,Rock solid dive watch,"The Luminox dive professional watch is a very solid well made piece. Nice design, fairly large at 45 mm although it wears a little smaller and a good substantial weight. Comfortable to wear with a good quality long rubber strap. Easy to read uncluttered face and great lume in the dark. I would like it even better if the 12 o'clock marker would glow a different color like some of the other Luminox models do. Very nice overall and a good choice to wear in harsh conditions as I have had mine for awhile and it has proven very resistant to scratches and wear. I've been well pleased with mine and I would recommend it."
5,Prompt and Efficient,"I received the item I ordered in such a short time, not only it was quick delivery but the book was also in perfect condition. I highly recommend this seller."
3,moby dick,"Tthe book came as promised, and in the advertised condition, but it is NOT part of the Enriched Classic Series.It's an Airmont Classic, which only includes an intro by a PhD. It's a wicked old version, which is actuallykind of fun 1964--- to read an american classic with old and yellowed pages. I like that part.It is complete and unabridged, but I thought I was getting a lot more ""Enrichment""when I ordered.Sadly, it's just a copy of Moby Dick, a bit weathered... lacking the scholarly infoi thought I had ordered.:("
5,Loved it!,"Beautiful work of art! A must read for lovers of Classic Literature. It is one book you will have to sit down and focus your time and attention to though because the author has done such an amazing job at filling the pages of this story with detail not only for the characters but for the world as well, that you lose yourself in the story!"
4,good and really cheap,"This works very well and I believe has multiple speeds. I got this though when it was 2.99 or 3.99 (and the free velvet pouch was not included!) it was so cheap i figured, why not. it worked about a year, then it just broke so I got another one. the second one is still working but it seems to run out the battery if I keep the battery in (like it is now in an always on position?). however it has worked equally long as a $30 model i've bought in the past. if the $30 model had lasted longer, I would give this one a bad rating. but since it lasted about the same amount of time, it gets a good rating cause it is WAY cheaper! its quite small too which is nice."
5,Great Start to Finish,"This was a pleasant surprise that just keeps on giving. As a fan of Way Out West, I had high expectations for the Nick Warren disc and was almost entirely satisfied. Disc 1 is solid from start to finish with a softer start and a few tracks near the end that could thump in any progressive set. I listen to this disc start to finish often and rarely consider skipping around. That says a lot..."
5,Nick Warren at his best,"If you are a global underground fan this is the cd for you, there is only one word needed to define disc 1, beautiful, the tracks nick warren picks for this cd reminds me of why I love music and if you listen you will agree, cd 2 ain't bad, a little more up tempo than cd 1 and full of catchy rythms, but trippy rythms is what nick warren does best. One of the Best cd's i've listened to, I salute NIck Warren and Global Underground. Cd 1 e"
4,Essential for Fans of Stonewall Jackson,"For fans of Stonewall Jackson, this is an essential read. It presents Jackson as a warm family man with a deep faith in God--something that doesn't come across in books focused on his military exploits. Jackson was a man of character aside from his accomplishments on the battlefield and this book helps bring that out. For those who are not Civil War buffs or fans of Jackson, you will probably not find this book interesting."
2,Several pages are hard to read.,Some pages(pp276-347) of this reprinted edition are hard to recognize. I strongly recommend you to buy an old book.
5,Unusual 20th Century Autobiography,"A lovely, calm, well-written and beautifully illustrated book. The biography covers the end of the Victorian era and the first half of the 20th century in middle class, literary-artistic society in London. Pooh does not appear, and the reader won't miss him."
2,stud goes a-writin',"This book was ok, dabbled with some clever turns of phrase and flashes of insight. However, it frankly got a little old that, regardless of the story's specifics, the narrator (a fella) was going to get some, and the lady was going to fall for him, hard.I mean, I'm happy Mr. Almond is so successful with the ladies, but when that's the only message that's reliably communicated in each story, it becomes the opposite of edgy. that is, dull."
4,sexing the short story,"a post-modern heir to philip roth, almond is hysterically lyrical and poignant in the sack; his sad sack academically inclined male protagonists just can't seem to tame their libido. hence, love/sex/coupling inevitably curdles. not all stories here are top-drawer (heavy metal, republicam, pale lover, ex.. are the cream of the crop.) almond is weakest, surprisingly so, at the end of his stories, as if to say, he is worn-out, post-coitally exhausted. the endings don't satisfy. nor are they checkovian. they hang, so to speak, limp."
5,such a good read.,"i absolutely loved this book, despite what one critic said about it presenting women one-dimensionally... i didn't really feel that way, and i am a woman. i felt like his writing was ruthless, daring, and very edgy. i mean, with lines like ""it was like having happy birthday sung to me each day: ecstatic and deeply disquieting"" (my life in heavy metal) or ""and now you listen to me, you people with your poise and careful judgements: These are the things I did. And I was punihsed for them, as wel are all punished, in the end, for the degradations we inflict upon those who love us. Sorrow waits, with the patience of a psalm, for the infidel."" (also from the story ""my life in heavy metal"")In spots Almond's voice reminds me of Ewart's poetry; his lines are cutting and and truthful; I especially liked the first three. I highly reccommend this book. So good, sexy, brilliant."
2,Did not live up to its promise...,"I am not really sure what my expectations were but for some reason this collection of stories did not live up to its promise. They're okay stories, not particular innovative or inspiring, good for a quick read in the airport, waiting for your flight, or perhaps in a long queue at the check-out. The collection promises stories of love and longing, and most of the stories do have that theme, yet I couldn't help think of the many, many collections of stories which have done a much better job at this theme. What I do agree with though - in fact another reviewer (who gave the collection three stars also pointed this out) is that the author has a wonderful way with dialogue and words. He is definitely a smart writer. Is that enough? No, not really."
2,"pretty pictures, but a poor text choice","I ""inherited"" Smith's book from my predecessor as the text for a general ecology course (junior-level). I found it to be a poor choice. The fifth edition appears to have undergone recent and massive revision; the text had far more than its fair share of typos, literature citations that were not listed in the bibliography, and perhaps most damningly, colorful figures that were often inadequately explained and sometimes incorrectly labeled. While I understand the presence of factual errors - a text with a subject as diverse as ecology would be difficult for one person to write - there is no excuse for them. All in all, this book was a disappointment."
3,"Great book for class, but...",The text itself is fine and wonderful for class but unfortunately as soon as I opened the book half the table of contents and preface can apart from the spine and the rest are just as easy to pull out.
4,Ecology Text,Textbook in great condition. Was here in a timely manner. Needed for a college course and will come in handy.
1,"Did not receive it, but got money back","I did not receive my book because it was out of stock. Some weeks later, I got my money back."
3,Not a great music composition,Seems some indian musician trying to sound like enigma and Linkin Park. Get yourself a break. Listen to original western music instead. If you want to listen to good Indian music I would recommend:1)Bombay Theme from movie Bombay2) Any of Pandit Ravishankars works.3)LagaanI guess these are the some of the original works.
3,Notre Dame Soccer Ball Pendant is about the Size of a Dime!!,"This Notre Dame Soccer Pendant is about the Size of a Dime, so the writing is hard to see. I guess for $36/sterling silver, it's what one might expect, but the picture makes it appear bigger and so I was somewhat disappointed. Each one is made by special order, so it takes a little while before it ships. I contacted the company directly and they were very nice & helpful. I gave this to my niece for her graduation, she's playing soccer for Notre Dame, and she seemed pleased, but wish it had been slightly bigger. I spent $47 with shipping, and felt like it was a lot to spend on an item that was that small. It's ok, but not great!"
1,failure to ship,"Can't tell if this is a good item because Super Deal never shipped it, nor did they bother to tell me until I asked where it was a week later...however...Amazon is very good about returning my $ to the credit card..."
1,Haven't Received The Product,"I haven't receive this product, I am waiting tath the seller give me my money back"
5,One Interesting Spin on Lycanthropy After Another,"I must say that I picked this book up initially just because I was bored, but it delivered much more then I thought it would. From the lighthearted ""Stag Party"" to the highly intriguing and thought-provoking ""The Way Things Should Be"", this book had more twists on the were-mythology then any compliation I've seen. Brilliant. Simply Brilliant."
5,"mostly light-hearted, quite entertaining","Bought this book as an airplane reader... had a few hours to kill. I thouroughly enjoyed it. it was perfect for what I was looking for. There's some serious stuff in there, but it's mostly light (were-guppy???)."
2,Way too predicatable,"Quite simply, plot twists are fun. Most stories need them to be exciting. The plot twist of all the stories is that someone turns into another creature. You usually can figure out what they are going to turn into in the first page. Most authors in here use that as thei main plot twist and the results are tedious. There are some good stories in here, particularly towards the back of the book. If you have nothing else to read I would start reading from the back and give up about halfway through. Overall this book is a waste of time and money."
4,I was really impressed! I loved it!,"Although I am not one for actors-turned-singers, Jim did a most excellent job on this album. My favorite cut was Leap of Faith........wonderful job! Hope to hear rumours of another album in the future......great job Jimmy B!"
3,Good Album,"It's good but not great. Don't get me wrong, I'll listen to it and enjoy it. The band's good and the recording is as well. Jim's vocals are fine but nothing that's going to set anyone's ears on fire. I think I'd enjoy seeing him live. I hate saying bad things about good albums but this one is just kind of flat, sterile, etc. That's sad to say considering the band's performances are top notch. That being said, it's kind of like they all learned the songs in the studio the day they recorded them and just played the arrangements. As a result, they don't seem to have the spark to inject life into the songs. Buy this album and you'll probably enjoy it, I did. Just don't expect to be ""over the top impressed"". I wasn't."
5,Surreal MMMMMMMMM,"This is really an incredible CD set and by far the best by Nick Warren to date. CD #1 is filled with focused trance music and CD #2 is slightly more ""ravy"". I myself prefer CD #1, especially for driving in the fog, writing poetry and ...well, you know...those other activities...The best on CD#1 - The first four tracks: Avatar - Dub in Time followed by Substructure - Firewire followedd by Atlas - Compass Error followed by Ulrich Schnauss. This is truly truly sublime. #10 is rather humourous and I'm not sure where he got the voiceover.CD #2 is also quite good, especially Tracks 3 and 4 (Vector - Rise followed by Aquaculture - Don't Play the Game).I am definitely not an expert on rave, house, trance or such music, but I know what I like to listen to. This is even better than Nick's BACK TO MINE set that I purchased last year. Overall, this entire set is very surreal."
4,An Excellent Mix,"NIck Warren has really nailed it this time.Starting the first disk off with the best in downtempo and IDM, like the incredible Ulrich Schnauss, and then moving into excellent breaks, while still keeping things mellow with ambient interludes ( the mix from burufunk's 'outsider' into Global Communication's '14:31' is absolute Genius...)The second CD keeps it simple with very solid, deep trance. Definitely good, but the first disc is the keeper... I would say that the first disc is worth the price alone."
4,Interesting Mix,"This album is a somewhat odd mix of EuroRock/Rap/Retro. The covers of oldies are orchestrated to deliver fresh versions. The RockRap offerings are tolerable and somehow seemlessly blended well enough to not detract from Fancy's signature sound. The purest Euro dance rock cuts like SOUL FOR SALE are true to his style and if only for these, are worth having in a CD collection that provides a unique element in a genre that is not nearly as widespread as other classes of music."
5,Some great remixes of Popular Songs. Superb!,"Superb collection for the Fancy fans. Has some very nice remixes of his early 90s album tracks, like Sail Away and Fools Cry. Some newer tracks that are a bit out of place like Pretty Woman. Not really suited for his style and sounds corny, but Fancy is the master at Euro-disco, so pick up this collection. If you are a fan of Fancy try Modern Talking1st Album, Bad Boys BlueThe Bad Boys Bestor Secret ServiceTop Secret: Greatest Hitsyou will like these groups."
2,NOT user friendly,"This has got to have the worst manual I have ever tried to use. I gave this a 2 star instead of zero or one because I'm sure there's lots of things I haven't made use of or figured out yet. Even though I've been trying for several days. A step by step of capture, edit, render would be nice. It tells you the general idea of how everything works (with no logical order) and you have to play around to eventually figure it out. I don't think it's possible to even see what the visual effect of a transition is without a long render time.I'm usually a very hands-on learner that doesn't require manuals. But this leaves you floundering, then the manual and help just give you bits and pieces to help you flounder just a little less until you eventually figure it out (maybe).Very disappointed."
4,Tragic Hope,"This is the story of Faina, a young girl sent to live with her mother and sister, neither of whom she has ever known, while her father takes a job on an Alaskan rig to pay off gambling debts.Faina starts off charmingly naiive, but is quickly immersed into the tragic world in which her sister and mother live. In different ways she becomes a magnet of salvation for both mother and sister, both of whom seek redemption and freedom from the choices of their past. It is truly a compelling read -- a simple story of a girl suddenly thrust into a highly unstable environment. There is not a hint of fakeness to the book. You almost want to reach out and wipe Faina's tears away with a Kleenex.This is not at all the type of book that I usually read, but I would highly recommend it."
2,Aspen casebooks are horrible,"I have used a bunch of different types of casebooks and now whenever a prof. assigns an Aspen casebook, I know it's going to be a rough course. The problem starts with the text font. Aspen does not clearly distinguish where a case ends and where an editor is writing. The editor's writing, the sections of cases are all written in ths same font, same spacing, and same margins, so that at a quick glance, you don't know if it's part of a case or editorial notes.Con Law is obviously a huge subject, and there are lots of cases, but there are too many cases saying the same thing in here. Editors should just pick one major case to stick in the casebook. Unfortunately, they end up sticking in about 3 or 4 where one would have been fine.The use of rhetorical questions in the notes at the end of some cases is also really annoying."
3,Required for a law class,"This book was required for my Constitutional Law class in law school. I guess it's an OK book. The condition I received it in was fairly good. There really wasn't much I was looking for because it was merely a required book for a class, and getting it from here was the least expensive option for me."
1,So much talent .............,"There is no doubt he is a very talented guitarist. It's what he does with that talent that fails to engage me. Everyone describes this album as innovative, and that word usually scares me when applied to music, as it does here.His comment in the notes that ""...it is more important to 'feel the pain'..."" is at the core of what I don't like about this album. I'm not looking for pain in music. I look for pleasure mostly, but sometimes for anger or sadness or other emotions to help give me insight into my own. But pain? I've had enough of my own, I don't want more. Sometimes it is inescapable, but I'll never knowingly pursue it.I want music to be about resolution and moving on, not about wallowing in misery. But if you want to wallow, you've come to the right place."
3,Three Diablos is not worth buying,"I liked Puss in Boots, especially when they showed him as a kitten, so I wanted to see the Three Diablos short film. It's only 11 minutes. The animation of the kittens is not the same quality as Puss in Boots. They don't look furry, but more like a Sims character with a pattern over a flat surface. There were a couple cute moments but it wasn't too entertaining. I would want to see more of Puss in Boots as a kitten, but Three Diablos doesn't satisfy that for me."
3,Disappointed,"I ordered the double pack (puss in Boots movie and the Three Diablos ""movie"") for my 5 yr old daughter because she saw a commercial for the movie and it said it came with the Three Diablos movie. It finally came in the mail, she was super excited, she popped in the Three Diablos, and it was 11 minutes long. She was extremely disappointed, as was I. Now I know why in the ""description"", it didn't say the length of the ""movie"". She loves the Puss In Boots movie, its a great movie. She just thought, as did I, that she was getting another Puss in Boots movie."
1,Smells and tastes bad,Has an off smell & doesn't taste like fresh blackberries at all. Stick to the Oregon canned tart cherries. They are so much better. Wish I had not bought these.
1,deceptive - avoid this CD,"No offense to the musicians who put this together. It's listenable bar band music, but Jerry Garcia it ain't. Nowhere on the cover does it warn you that it's his old band playing cover versions of their old hits. I have it, have never gotten through the whole Cd. I'll give it to you if you pay the postage. Not worth even thinking about."
1,Where's Jerry?,"It is, at best, a bit disingenuous to market an album by ""JGB"", even though Mr. Garcia ain't on it. At worst, it's a blatant..."
4,You're CRAZY!!!!,"I haven't a clue what these one star reviews are thinking either. Not only was I happy to see something put together by old sausage fingers Melvin Seals, but it is really good as well. These other reviews are just standard pain felt by fans of Jerry and his passing. I saw the same thing with long time fans of Widespread Panic. They just didn't want to accept that something could come after Mikey's passing, and now they are jamming still 8 years later.I had the honor of seeing this incarnation of JGB three times and every time was great. The second time they brought the crowd to another dimention.So do yourself a favor and buy this fantastic bar bands CD and remember the good ol days. And if you don't have it already take a look at Jerry Garcia Bands ""How Sweet It Is"" live album along with the others."
4,A Nice Set by Long-time JG Musicians.,"A nice set that captures a little of Jerry's light, even though he had passed a couple of years previously. In his later years, Jerry's musicianship could be hit & miss, but Melvin Seals and this band perform well together. A nice Jerry experience, without Jerry, and Melvin wails on the organ. Those who are complaining it's not Jerry, just weren't paying attention, it was well known that this album was recorded and released AFTER Jerry's death. Even the Amazon page shows the dates of the disc. It IS the JGB, but Jerry had passed, and they weren't done sharing this music with appreciative audiences. A fun set."
4,"sure, its not jerry, but it is still good","The purists in the world will always complain that this isn't Jerry, and they are right, but hey, he's dead and there's nothing we can do about it. To be honest, i would rather listen to his friends honor his memory wiht good music than the hacks of skynrd and others who can't even keep up with their late brother's chops. nonetheless, the gospel section is smoking as is ""don't let go"". Musically, it is a great album."
4,Does Jackie Really play the Piano??,"Overall, i thought Twin Dragons was pretty good. The fight scenes were great! Some of the supporting actors were morons, but Jackie's characters were fun to watch. It was a humorous movie, and one i'd recommend to Jackie Fans, although it is not one of his Best, it's still good!"
5,outstanding!,"This is a great book for so many reasons! I bought this as a gift for someone and thought about keeping it for myself. It has wonderful little poems throughout. There is a whole section on the death of a pet as well containing poems, eulogies, and songs. A great book for anyone who has a special pet:)"
3,Animal blessings is a blessing,"For anyone who has ever loved an animal, this is a heartwarming little book. No need to read it just once - pick it up anytime."
4,A nice follow-up to Suzuki,"Though nowhere as good as its predecessor, 1999's ""Suzuki"", Dehli 9 comes in as a nice follow-up to it. With a less downbeat sound that seems closer to that developed over the past couple of albums by Thievery Corporation, the Austria-based DJ/producer team, Kruder & Dorfmeister, comes back with a work that still retains elements characteristic of their musical signature, such as their typical percussion and keyboard accents nicely spread throughout the album. As an overall recomendation, I would probably get started with ""Suzuki"" but if you already have that one and liked it, I would give ""Dehli 9"" a shot."
3,"Listenable, but not nearly as enjoyable.","I was excited to find a new release from Tosca, but found this release to be a let down. The production values are high, the vocals are smooth and the sound is very polished. Tosca and the entire genre of downtempo is known to be repetitive, but this was just boring. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I don't find this album engaging. Perhaps I did not give the second cd a chance, but I found it completely worthless. It's nothing but one incredibly long, boring piano piece. I listened to the first few ""songs"", skipped through the rest of the disc to find more of the same, put it back in its case and it's remained there ever since.This CD isn't bad, it just isn't that great."
2,Great songs - Poor production,"I have to say I am a big fan of almost everything put out by G-Stone. I have always been impressed by the studio's high standards and overall quality of production....except in this case. Tosca's latest release is marred by glitches in effects returns, occasional clicks, hiss and generally poor attention to detail. I must say I was quite surprised by the lack of care put into mastering this album, particlarly the second disk. The songs are terrific, but such messy production makes it very difficult for me to get into the groove. Of course, if you have little concern for quality and just want to play this album really loud at a party or club, you will love it."
5,Good trippy chill...,Great CD. Bought it after reading other reviews online. They were correct. Some ecclectic sounds and moods coming from this one but a true pleasure to experience. Thought provoking in a very laid back and playful way. Really sinks into you and engages you when you listen to it. Big hit with my friends too after they heard it.
3,Tosca flinches and misses,"Tosca doesn't explore horribly new territory here, but keeps some good beat ideas learned from his last albums. A few vocal tracks start off the album with good energy, but the downhill half of the album is just that: downhill. The last half feels like an afterthought of the duo... not to mention the second CD, which is an hour of ""Pearl In""-like music.Favorite track, out and away by a mile, is ""Wonderful."" While this song is very awesome and great, it is very unlike the work on the previous albums: Zinger performs full sentence stream of consciousness lyrics over Tosca grooves, a first for a Tosca track.The packaging is exquisite, and makes you feel like you've made a great purchase... and it is, at the very least for the extremely nice feeling of the outer CD case. The music inside does not have a similarly impressive vibe.(...)"
3,Just didn't grab me like Tosca did,"I've given Dehli 9 a few listens and there are some fairly cool tunes, but so far it hasn't grabbed me like Tosca. I'll keep listening though. My advice at this time is that if you dig the K&D formula, pick up a good quality used copy instead of shelling out full price and you'll be happy."
4,Great 30 minute workout,"I would recommend this video to other intermediate exercisers who are looking for something to do when they don't have time for a 60 minute video. The instructor is energetic, and explains each exercise very clearly. The backup exercisers hoot and holler throughout the routine (as if these buff ladies are really getting tuckered out by a few squats) which might irritate some, but personally I find it entertaining, and it gives me something to chuckle at while I'm working out. The most effective segment is probably the abs, they don't skimp even though its only a 30 minute video. My only complaint is that there is too much lag time- sometimes this occurs because as each exercise is being explained, you're standing there doing nothing. In addition there are these ""motivational"" blurbs thrown in between segments. Of course it dosen't take much sense to realize that you can just keep doing the previous moves until the routine starts up again."
3,for beginners,"I am new to exercising (about 2 months) and this was one of my first purchases. Even from day 1, it was so easy to complete all of the exercises. I have increased my weights and still don't really get much from this video. The is the video I do when I'm short on time and need some form of exercise for the day. It's 30 minutes long and includes arm and leg work as well as a short ab workout at the end. It's very low impact so I would guess it's perfect for those new to exercising or those who want a light workout. I don't think I'll be seeing much tone from this video. On the good side, it is fun and the time flies. The instructor takes her time to show you proper form. On the downside the quality of the tape itself leaves a lot to be desired. It seems to have been recorded on the fasted mode so it sets off my vcr's automatic tracking too often."
4,quickie total body workout,"It's a great workout for those times when you don't have too much time but you want a total body workout. It's great for legs, butt and abs. If you have more time, combine it with a cardio routine for a great calorie burning and toning."
2,Ridiculous,"is the conductor being paid like a taxi driver? The qucker he reaches the end of the journey the more he gets? If the orchestra played this any faster you would'nt even know what it was. And I thought Solti rushed things along !! There are much better small orchestra performances than this one, let alone full scale orchestra performances. This is ridiculous."
4,Adventures on a Far Planet,"I knew Jeffrey Redmond through the Asatru community for many years and knew him to be an original thinker and a real mensch. This book takes the form of historical chronicles from a distant planet, and features adventures, war, romance, death and all the good stuff. I think that the science fiction community and the Asatru community will both continue to be increasingly enthusiastic about the Er-Da series."
4,Chronicles of Er-Da: Book Two,"This is Redmond's second book of short fantasy stories. There's all kinds of weird and wacky characters in them, getting in and out of every kind of trouble and situation. There's something for everyone: action, adventure, suspense, survivalism, romance, and everything else. More good stories and reading for teens and students. Enjoy!"
1,Extremely disappointing,"Waste of time and money. All the information in this book is a result of one week browsing the web. Author lacks any logical categorization, jumps from topic to topic. Most of the book has absolutely nothing in common with the subject."
3,Disappointed,"I bought the book expecting some insights into what manufacturing would look like in 2020 and how I could focus my efforts. What I found was too much ""look how brilliant I am"" and not enough on where things were headed. The last third of the book was more useful with some good information. So, I read it cover to cover but was left wanting."
5,This Book Brought Me Business!,"Wow! ""Never Be Boring Again"" gave me an easy-to-follow process that impacted my business immediately. I used the Story Theater Method for a brief business presentation. Each speaker only had 15 minutes so I created a ""Phrase That Pays"" using Doug's method and made sure I repeated it often as the key benefit of using my services. Plus, I used Doug's technique of stepping in and out of story for extra impact. Within 48 hours of my presentation, I signed 9 new clients. ""Never Be Boring Again"" gave me the tools to stand out in a crowd and be remembered -- several of my clients still use the original ""phrase that pays."""
5,"Written by the creator of the ""Story Theater Method""","Never Be Boring Again is a solid, 352-page guide to spicing up business presentations in such a manner so as to fully captivate attention, inspire and motivate action, and bring about tangible, practical results. Expertly written by the creator of the ""Story Theater Method"", speech writer, and presentation consultant Doug Stevenson, Never Be Boring Again focuses on stories as power for getting and keeping the audience's full attention, peppered with tips, tricks, and techniques to keep 'em coming back for more. If you are charged with speaking in public, then Doug Stevenson's Never Be Boring Again is enthusiastically recommended reading for you!"
2,Wrong size,"Ordered large & got medium, not worth the hassel of returning, does not require 9 more words to explain this."
2,Disappointing and Unhelpful,"Speaking as someone with a degreee in math, plus some graduate work, I found this book frustrating and disappointing. I wanted to fill in some historical perspective to all the math I had learned, but I was little illuminated by this book. While the author clearly knows a lot about math, his writing is vague, poorly organized, and unfocused. He answered few of my questions and does not present a coherent picture of his topic. Rather than this book, I recommend Morris Kline ""Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times"", which is infinitely better."
4,A good general outline of Mathematics,"While the style could be better, this is a general and good outline of the history of mathematics.I would point out that the little time spent on Al-Magi Al-Khawarizmi (literally ""The Magus (Zorastarian, not Muslim) from Khazar (near the Caspian Sea)"") is justified. Al-Khawarizmi merely translated the formulaic Algebra (which the Indians developed from the Greeks and systemized it from its rhetorical origin) from a Hindu text (brought to the court of the Caliph by Indian Ambassadors seeking trade, they were soon rewarded with Moghul Jihad) and translated the Hindu word for 'reorganisation' or 'rebalancing' into Arabic (Al-Jabr). From there, Spanish scholars were able to access the work. As a translator, AL-Khawarizmi certainly provided a service, but he was a Zorastarian from the biggest population of Zorastarians outside of Persia, Khazar. No self-respecting Muslim would keep ""al-Magus"" as part of his name after conversion."
4,MVC-FD85 is a worth while purchase!,"I purchased this little beauty 1 week prior to the Christmas since we were going for a short trip [1wk]. I've used this camera in all the modes for three weeks now at family gatherings, vacation and parties. The day after the party I up load the pictures that I took to the hosts Email for distribution. The still pictures can be taken in different levels of image size 1280x960,1280(3:2),1028x768,640x480 and Movie 320x240, 160x112 for (up to 1 minute w/sound).This Sony is my first ""Digital Camera""...I have taken approx. 300 pictures in the last 3 weeks. Instant ""LED"" viewing is perfect for capturing ""GOOD pictures"" as you can delete bad ones right away. Don't loose the instruction book. The ""LED"" menus are simple but their are a lot of them.The MVC-FD85 is advertised as a ""Still Camera"", personally I have used it for everything but a tipod!"
1,Nothing easy about this one,"Day Trading Made Easy is not exactly what you will call a strong how to book. The book contains many definitions, but no substance. The title is great, the execution is poor at best. There is nothing easy about day trading. The book is confusing. If you are looking for definition of day trading terms, then read this book. If you are looking to learn how to trade successfully, spend the money and take a seminar. This book will teach you nothing of value.I have to agree with the reviews written by Steve Flacks, Stephen, and Fred Morgan. I think they have expressed their feelings about this book very well. Read those reviews before you buy this book it will save you more money than just the price of this book."
4,"comprehensive, timely",This guidebook provides a comprehensive foundation for successful Day-Trading. Sarkovich offers key insights and successful strategies for both new and experienced traders. This is a must-read for anyone considering the risks/rewards of this fast paced field. His alternatives re. financing are viable options to help the new trader build his nest-egg while actively trading with highly leveraged funds.
2,About the author,"From the back cover, ""Misha T. Sarkovich, Ph.D., once the managing partner for a day-trading firm is an economist for a large utility company ...""Why would someone who thinks day trading is easy enough to write about, would be an economist for a large utility company? Why doesn't he trade for a living? Obviously, if day trading was easy, he would be day trading and not holding a salary paying job. Avoid this book and buy books that are written by full-time traders, such as Raschke, Connors, Cooper, and the like.I just wonder why the author is not a managing partner of a day trading firm anymore. Is it because all of his clients lost their money while trading at his firm after being trained by him?I think the review by Flacks from Encino is excellent. I would have given the book only one star myself, but could not do so after Flacks gave it two stars. I guess the author deserves two stars for the effort. AVOID!"
2,A REAL MONEY MAKER,I really enjoyed reading this book. It was very amusing to say the least. I found the book to be full of errors providing the reader with nothing new. Same old outdated stuff that doesn't work.
1,"FULL OF ERRORS, FLUFF AND FILLER!","THIS BOOK OFFERS INCORRECT AND IRRELEVANT EXPLANATIONS OF ORDER EXECUTION METHODS, LEVEL II SCREENS, RISK MANAGEMENT AND MORE. THE AUTHOR FAILS TO DELIVER HIS OWN TRADING STRATEGY AND CONTRADICTS HIMSELF THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE THE AUTHOR SAY THAT HE TRADES ONLINE SUCCESSFULLY AND WHICH METHODS AND STRATEGIES HAVE WORKED WELL FOR HIM OVER THE YEARS OTHER THAN READ ANOTHER ""HOW TO GENERATE COMMISSIONS"" FOR THE BROKER TYPE OF BOOK!THE ONLY ONE WHO WILL GAIN FROM THIS BOOK IS YOUR BROKER OR THE BROKER THAT IS FEATURED IN THIS BOOK AND ON THEIR ""INTERACTIVE"" WEBSITE.AVOID THIS BOOK!"
1,AVOID THIS BOOK!,"I found this book to be full of errors and information that is not correct. The author tells you about risk, yet he tells you that you can get financed by someone else and use their money without them taking any risk at all. This was in the very first section of the book and after reading that section I knew that what was to follow is questionable. And indeed it was.Bad information, errors and complexity followed the first section of the book. I was very dispointed and returned my book to the store. I should have known not to buy this book in the first place, because it says on the back cover that the author works for a utility company. It does not say that the author trades stocks for a living anywhere in the book, or that he successfully traded any of the strategies in the book. On a scale of a Strong Sell to Strong Buy, I rate this book as strong sell, and if you can, you may want to short this one."
5,Excellent Introduction to Day Trading,Electronic Day Trading Made Easy makes learning about day trading easy. This book is a must for any new trader. Misha Sarkovick reviews all the necessary considerations a new trader needs. This book is an excellent introduction to day trading made easy. I highly recommend this book.
2,Nothing but fluff,"OK, if you want to read something that gives outline view of what Day Trading is about, go ahead and buy this book. If your looking to build a foundation for a successful career in trading, move on. Not only is this book a warmed up re-hash of material covered in dozens of other books, the information is really dated. I suppose that if we could roll the clock back to 1999, you could read this book, start trading and you'd probably feel pretty talented. But in reality, all you needed to know in 1999 was 3 or 4 steps.1) Pick a stock,2) Buy the stock3) Sell it after it goes up.4) Repeat steps 1 through 3."
5,good book,Easy read with a lot of great pictures. Provides a good framework to approach breast imaging. I liked it so much I ordered the whole series
4,Perfect kids knex starter pack!,This was bought for my 2 yo son as a toy he could enjoy now but also grow into. He has a lot of fun as does my 3 1/2 yo son. It provides lots of scope for imagination. We bought an extra small pack separately and are thrilled that the blocks connect in with Duplo making for a very versatile toy!! This big box is the perfect start pack to build from.
4,My son loves these!,We bought these for our son for his birthday and Christmas. He loves to play with them and the set is big enough for his sister to join in too. A great toy that is durable and fun for a wide age group.
5,Great Set for Kids,This a great set for young kids. It helps them with their eye hand coordination and simple enough for them to use!
4,For my grandson,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 2+ year old grandson. Immediately upon opening them, he began to sort pieces and connect pieces. It's a hit!."
5,Tons of CREATIVE FUN!,"I bought this for my 4 1/2 yr. old son after watching him play with the set in his preschool classroom. It has provided HOURS of independent playtime. I love that this kit gets him to use his imagination and create his own fun. So many toys today do everything for the child and don't encourage any creativity. As an educator myself, I think this set is definitely worth the money."
3,prohibiting poverty,"This was written by my great grandmother. Did not know it was still available. I do have an original, but will obtain another copy. Of the day, it may have been a vision of good. But, I do not agree with its political views. Far too much government and intrusion to personal lifestyle and work , education . I at times speak softly with the content thinking was this really what Prestonia believed to be a better way to live?"
1,SONY VAIO Neoprene Cases,"The AC adapter case is fine, holds items securely and has an inside strap. Also able to fit additional battery.The Laptop case is extremely thin and very loose fitting. It's not worth the purchase.The company ships FedEx, not UPS as Amazon does. Keep this in mind."
4,Nice for the price...,"This product was nice for the price paid (Sony charged at least $10 more). The one downside, in my opinion, was that I expected better/more padding than it has. I would guess the neoprene case is a mere 2/3 mm. In comparison, that is the same thickness as a surfing wetsuit. I was hoping for somewhere between 5-7mm for the extra cushion. Nevertheless, I'm satisfied."
5,Fit with my Vaio FZ series laptop,"I think you would be satisfied this vaio case,because it's truly designed for your vaio laptop.also other 15.4"" display laptops. I highly recommend this one for everyone who wanna buy a case for laptop and its adapter."
5,Great cover for the Sony Vaio Laptop,"I purchased this Laptop cover for the Sony Vaio laptop and its a perfect fit for the Laptop size specified. The material is durable and soft. Provides protection from dust and dirt, but since its just a laptop sleeve it does not provide protection against water or any kind of shocks to the laptop (e.g. dropping the laptop etc.)"
1,Movie DV Suite 4.0,"To put it simply, it;s a piece of junk. The installation was complicated, and it totally messed up my computer when I finally got it to work. Ever since I had this software on my computer, every time I plug in my camcorder, I need to re-install the MovieDV software AND my camcorder software. After only 3 or 4 uses, I gave up on the whole thing completely."
2,bad quality,"I bought this item and when it came, it was still wrapped in plastic. However, as i have been watching the discs, the quality is pretty bad. There are no obvious scratches to the disc, but it skips, gets stuck, and the sound does not match the picture. I tried them in two different DVD players, my laptop, and my roommates desktop computer just to make sure its not the machine. . . it wasn't."
4,Only one downside,"Everything came in just fine and very timely. The only thing that I didn't like was that I couldn't watch episodes 5 and 6.The disks of season one are double sided and are supposed to contain episodes 1-4 on side A and episodes 5 and 6 on side B. However, on my disk episodes 1-4 were on BOTH sides of disk 1. So I did not have episodes 5 and 6. I don't know if this was a major manufacturing accident that happened to everyone or if it just happened to mine. I didn't send it back like I could have done though because I wasn't very concerned about them. Aside from that one little mis-hap everything has been great."
2,Issues with some of the DVDs,"I purchased this set as a gift and the person I had given them to says that there are a couple DVDs in the set that are bad :( I had purchased it quite a while before Christmas so I didn't know about it until now. Other than that, it was shipped to me very promptly and appeared to be in good condition."
5,bones seasons 1-5,I really like this show. just enough drama and comedy. I watch this more than once. glad i bought it.
1,Buy this and get Boned!,I bought this as a gift thinking it was a Boxed Set. It is nothing more that the first five seasons shrink-wrapped together. I should have read the other reviews. Do yourself a favor: add the individual seasons to your cart and save $20+
5,Awesome,"One of the best shows I have seen in a while. Totally worth every penny spent! Great cast, and the plot always keeps you guessing!"
1,Good Deal?,$200.00 for the first five seasons isn't a very good deal considering the fact the you can purchase the first six seasons directly from Amazon for $205.44
5,Best Tarot Book,"I have 3 or 4 copies of this book, and recommend it to anyone who asks me about the Tarot. I've been studying and reading the tarot since I was a girl (in the 1960s). Once I read this, I used it as my only reference (except for some miscellanies she doesn't cover).I have emailed Ms Masino and asked her to write more books on the tarot!If you buy ONLY ONE tarot book, make it this one. If you already HAVE tarot books, buy this one also! There is no ""esoteric"" or ""metaphysical"" goobledygook here.... you learn from every single page.This HAS to be the clearest and most useful single book on the tarot, ever."
3,Interesting approach,"As a Christian, I saw in this book how many people on the path to Heaven experience life in so many different ways and through so many different trials. It made me appreciate the knowledge that God is always there and how He uses others."
5,worked well for us,"The best thing about this guide is the format. It is arranged alphabetically and each 'attraction' is on a two-page spread and contains description, tips, address, hours, age range, website, cost AND nearby kid-friendly places to eat and a 'hey kids' fun fact or something to look for when visiting this attraction. There are cross-reference lists by category (parks, museums, sports, etc.) and by neighborhood. This is a supplement -- not the only guide to carry since it has no maps -- but lots of useful information."
5,A true Texas songwriter,"Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful and gifted songwriters that helms from Texas. I was first introduced to her music through a friend. She has, as her album proves, a rare ability to fuse country, rock, and confessional songwriting. This album reveals a talented musician and time will definitely bring her to the forefront of Americana's best. Listen to Dry Spell and Long Way Home; the perfect soundtrack to a night's drive outside of the city limits."
2,Beware of Switch Problems,"I was told that they fixed the infamous switch problem a long time ago(2005?), so I went ahead and bought one. I have had it for about 2 years. After a few hours of very light hobby use, the switch failed exactly as many others have reported. I removed it and took it apart, and sure enough the switch was packed with saw dust. Imagine that, a router killed by saw dust! Amazing. I see that the Bosch website emphasizes that it ""now has a dust proof switch"". Brilliant. So, be warned that there may still be some units out there with the faulty switch. It's an easy and cheap fix, $15 for the part and shipping, but very frustrating to have to stop work in the middle of the job to fiddle with it, or worse, wait for parts to arrive.UPDATE: I purchased a new switch and received it yesterday. They sent me the exact same dust prone switch, rather than the new dust proof one!"
5,Another Great Bosch Tool!!,"This router is exceptional, I couldn't be happier. Bosch has never let me down--Great tool, Great Company!!Adjusting the height and depth is quick and the fine adjustment is in the thousands of an inch. It's lightweight and very quiet. I love the variable speed. It is easy to handle, controls are easy to get to, and the height adjustment couldn't be easier. The speed adjustment is very responsive and has many settings. As far as cutting goes, I am very pleased.Once again, I have nothing but praise for another Bosch power tool. If your in the market for a router,look no more! You will never need to buy another router again, I would know I've been in the wood working business for 20 years. This is a quality power tool that is a true workhorse!"
2,Didn't Last Long - Replacing with Porter Cable,"Won't start after about fifteen uses. After reading other reviews, I asume the switch failed. Took it apart to see if something obvious was wrong, like a burned wire. This I could repair. Saw nothing obvious but the motor and insides were filled with sawdust. What kind of design is this for a wood working tool that allows it to be ruined by saw dust?"
5,Wood Eating Son-of-a-Bosch,"This is a sweet machine! It's my first router. After reading many, many reviews, I decided on the Bosch. I am now a firm believer in taking the time to read the reviews for anything I buy. It's pretty easy to figure out which reviewers are reliable and know what they're talking about. This really helps with making a purchase. I am totally satisfied with the Bosch and it has lived up to everything the other reviewers have said about it. Buy this one. You won't be sorry."
2,"Great, except for a defective switch","It's great when it runs. Not so great when you're in the middle of a project and it won't turn on. I am on my 3rd SWITCH. Very frustrating. Add the cost of 2 extra switches, time to replace and order and shipping, and down time and this is one expensive tool!The plunging base is also flimsy plastic handled and is not nearly as stout as the main tool. Buy a heavy duty Porter Cable."
1,this item has no warranty it seems,I purchased the Bosch 1617 evs on december 27 2011 and tried to return it on february 10 2012 and was told i would be credited an amount that was applicable but i would be responsible for shipping charges. The router would just slow down and almost stop at just about any time. and would break the pieces i was working on.this does not seem like a very likeable warranty period. when i found out that amazon would not honor the warranty I proceeded to disassemble the machine and the only thing i could find was both brushes were chipped off on the armature end.
1,Undelivered Promises,"The Bosch 1617EVS is an attractive router package; however, Amazon is unable to deliver on it! Don't believe the ""ships in 24 hours"" claim. I've ordered the item on December 31st and since then I've been receiving ""delay in shipment"" notices. The one I received today promises me that I will not see the ordered router until the March time frame. Should I wait, they ask? Unfortunately, along with the router I've ordered several accessories. All of the accessories have arrived, but not the router. Do I wait? Do I cancel and return the accessories? Do I postpone the projects for which I've scheduled the router based on Amazon's false delivery date promise? What would you do? Go to Home Depot and buy a router that you can feel and touch and take home with you?I've been shopping with Amazon for many years and this is the first major let down on their part. Has Amazon outgrown its commitment to its customer base?"
1,Bad Switch and Bad Design,"If you ever plan to use this router mounted in a table pass it by. Purchase a different brand.I have owned the router for a little over one year. It is table mounted and used infrequently.I have had to replace the switch numerous times. The service tech told me that this is a common problem with this router, if table mounted, because of dust build up within the switch.Now after only 40 minutes of use it has failed again. Bosch offers no help and based on the history of the problem, dating back many years for other owners, it appears this very expensive router will become nothing more than a paper weight.No Warranty ... No Help ... No Quality"
4,Nice Router But It Has ON/OFF Switch Problems,"I have owned this router for 1 year now and for the most part I like it. However I have been having a problem with the ON/OFF switch. I was just about to take it to BOSCH Service when I decided to read some wood forums on the product. It appears that I am not the only one to have this problem. Several posts on different forums and even on this Amazon site, people are complaining of the ON/OFF switch failing or working intermittently. One reviewer said that you can gently remove the switch and clean it, which I did, this corrected the problem but it appears that the switch is prone to this dust problem. Other then the switch problem that can be frustrating especially when you're in the middle of using it, the router performs well. The variable speed and soft start are very nice. If Bosch fixes the switch problem this is easy a 5 star product."
2,Variable Speed Problems,"I use many routers. This is the worst of its price range. Sometimes it actually runs at top speed, but most of the time the variable speed knob cannot decide. Mega electrical tape all around the knob helps. Sometimes it runs smooth, but most of the time it runs rough. Sometimes it is easy to height adjust, but most of the time the tool does not slide in its holder properly. Consider purchasingPorter-Cable 892 2-1/4-Horsepower Router. It is much better all around and remains in a good mood."
2,"Nice router, bad switch","I've have a number of Bosch tools and they have all been good with the exception of 2 routers. One, the 1613 plunge router and this one, the 1617 plunge router/fixed base router kit. Both have bad switches. Both switches were replaced with new bad switches. Dust. How can a company that makes quality tools make routers with switches that are not dust proof? These routers were purchased 4-5 years apart. I thought that would be sufficient time to address the problem. Apparently not... No more Bosch routers for me."
5,It's just great,"My neighbor had the 1617 without the soft start. You had to hold the router with one hand while you flipped the switch with the other hand. It has a lot of torque and intially jerks hard in your hand. A sweaty or tired hand and you could have a problem.The recent review in Fine Woodworking loved this router, but also praised the D-handle. It cost ... more, but is worth every penny as it gives you complete control upon start-up. The soft start feature is great, the variable speed is good for large bits, but what sets this router apart from the others is the fine calibration on the depth gauge that allows you to make precision cuts. There is no better router for ...."
4,Router great but consider the combo,"Wanted to remind those thinking about this router to consider the combination plunge and fixed-based routers in the Bosch 1617EVSPK unit as an even better value. I have lots of good things to say about this router and recommend it. If you have or are considering a router table, leave the fixed base router housing on the table and do free-handing with the plunge router housing. The additional cost for the combo is definitely well worth it and if you have a router table you might regret saving a few dollars by not buying the combo set."
3,Two Classic 1980's Nora Roberts in book.,"Rules of the Game (1984) is a story about Brooke Gordon an advertising producer who finds herself directing Parks Jones a famous baseball player. It is a cute story of how two strong willed people merge.The Name of the Game (1988) is also based in LA about Johanna game show producer who has a connection with Sam a hunky actor when is agrees to do her trivia game show. There are some similarities in the stories and both are classic Harlequin love stories.If you are looking for some great romance novels I would suggest Nantucket Nights by Elin Hilderbrand, Bubbles series by Sarah Strohmeyer, Crazy For You by Kate Angell or Welcome to Temptation by Jennifer Crusie."
3,Musical joy,"Sandy Wilson's loveliest musical score.The only cavil being the lack of orchestral backup and this rich score demands more than what it has been given. This Chicester 1980's Bertice Reading CD version is skimpy and not as well-sung by some soloists as the original version. Bertice Reading and Fenella Fielding are wonderful but Robert Meadmore has the oddest voice I have ever heard in the musical theatre.Melodically and lyrically this is a gem. Much more sophisticated than Wilson's The Boyfriend, this score is gorgeous.Someday hopefully we may get a new version that orchestrally does justice to Wilson's masterpiece."
5,great quality,"I agree with Professor Bubba's review. I stumbled across this brand once in an outlet store called Big Lots. I got a box of 115 sheets of 4x6 smooth gloss for $7.00. I wish I had known then how great this product really was! That price was a steel for the quality of this product and I would have bought more. I've been trying to find it sold everywhere, finally found it here on Amazon."
1,cheated,"I thoght to read a story written by the ""right"" winslow but I was wrong. anyway I tried to read the book but I could not manage to. I quitted at page twenty. It should be an erotic novel, I found it just boring"
2,terrible,"This book could have been good but wasn't. The most memorable scene was the capture and rape of the female blond warrior and it was ridiculous. If your going to have a rape scene, fine, but the idea that the girl was exhausted from, and i quote, ""her own copious spendings"" after being violently gang raped was just to unbelievable. Most scenes are perfunctory and boring"
2,Rusted in under a year,"I WAS really happy with this, but it began rusting after a few months. I cleaned it and put some petroleum jelly on it, which has helped out, but it still is really irritating."
5,Good Quality,"Great quality. I have not had any rust issues.. and I bought this a year or two ago. I just use it to hang towels, and have a third rod with shower curtain. It wasn't difficult to install, but it did require two people. Never had it fall down, always stays up in position. Overall, works great!"
2,Duo Shower Curtain Rod,"We have had the rod since December 2010 but did not installed until the end of January 2011, we ordered it to use as a towel bar as well as a shower curtain rod. My husband was not real happy that we had to drill holes in the wall to install it, and neither of us are happy that after a year it's all rusted and looks terrible. Disappointed as we buy many things from Amazon and very seldom have any complaints."
3,"Good backgrounder, but...","This book provides many good principles.I was hoping for more, easy to adopt ""how to"" ways to build effective relationship evangelism habits.Other books on the subject I have liked especially are:-Evangelism Outside The Box (Rick Richardson, 2000)-Power Evangelism (John Wimber, 1992)-Witnessing Without Fear (Bill Bright, 1987-Out of the Salt Shaker (Rebecca Pippert)"
1,Not the puppy food for us,"This did not work for our puppy. It left her with quite the upset tummy. It was the food she came home from the breeder on, but something must have changed when she got home. We have since made the switch to eukanuba and she is a much happier pup! Plus, I am happier too since I'm no longer cleaning up after her all the time! As always, Amazon was great, but I would not recommend this food for your puppy."
5,Diamond Chicken Flavor Puppy food,Good product for the price. My dog is not picky and he puts it down fairly quick. Would recommend for the bigger puppys.
4,A good resource...especially for new teachers,"I purchased this book for a friend who is new to teaching theatre. A month later, she called me and told me how valuable a resource it was for her in the classroom. I think that it is well written and full of useful information."
1,CRAP!!,"First off, what a waste of money. I bought this book looking for an essential manual for High-School Theater Directors and what did I find? Crap. I have never read a book with such a condescending tone in all my life. This review can't even begin to tell how terrible this book was. After reading 2 pages I threw it in the fire, put the ashes in a glass jar and dropped it into a well...never to be seen again.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"
4,Une auteure à découvrir!!!,"Dans ce recueil de nouvelles, Aude nous fait partager des petits moments de la vie de gens déracinés, déprimés, épuisés, mal aimés, torturés... Mais surtout, elle nous démontre que, par dessus tout, la petite étincelle qu'est la vie finit toujours par triompher et dominer face à l'adversité. Que par la force de notre volonté, on peut toujours réussir à surmonter les difficultés. Bref c'est un hommage à la force du destin mais surtout à la puissance de la vie.Fidèle à son habitude, elle utilise une écriture simple et dépouillée mais combien forte et riche en mme temps. J'adore cette écrivaine!Je vous glisse au passage un extrait de la quatrième de couverture qui démontre toute la poésie de son écriture.""Tout est dans l'il. Mais il faut parfois du temps pour percevoir, au creux des petites morts quotidiennes, cet imperceptible mouvement qu'on appelle la vie."""
2,is there an afterlife,"The book was way to long, a lot of opinons with a lot of unproven information. I personally did not enjoy it and skipped over a lot of material because of the size. I would imagine some people will like it much better than I did and that is mainly because of the extensive (unproven and opinionated) material. Conclusion = No one really knows - do they? Which means one will have to wait until their demise to really find out."
1,Filled With Mistakes,"Idrove a car around three-quarters of the DR, using this book everystep of the way for nearly the entire trip. But many times the authorjust wrote a lot of nonsense. Places he describes aren't anything likethey really are, like he just asked other people to describe them andwrote what he heard from people who forgot a lot and gave him badinformation. This book is no good."
5,Great little everyday coat,I was looking for a boucle coat and I found this one - I wear it all the time. It has the kind of fit I was looking for.
4,decent chrome part,Part has decent plating but i had to egg shape it a little to get it tight enough to stay in place.
1,wrong part,the listing for this item said that it was for the rear of my vehicle. this part in fact only fits the front
3,"Seems fine, but watch grease fittings","They seem of fine quality, but be careful threading in grease fittings. One of them wouldn't thread in right, and actually pulled out when I tried to pull the grease gun off the nipple. I had to re-thread with a larger size and just put a bolt in it."
5,The best reference,"I have traveled in Italy many times. I do not speak fluent Italian but am doing my best to learn enough to get by. The Michelin guide is by far the best reference to use for restaurants. I would not go to Italy without it. I have been to restaurants ranging from one fork to three star and I never hit a loser restaurant using this guide. In addition, the maps have helped so many times in finding hotels, sites to see and restaurants. Even if you do not speak Italian, you could find the book very helpful with just a few minutes of study to understand what the symbols mean. The guide also gives email addresses, websites, etc. that are very helpful in planning trips. For sophisticated travelers, this is the best of the guides."
1,Might be OK if you can read Italian.,"Having purchased the wonderful Michelin Green Guide to Italy, I looked forward to the Red guide to hotels and restaurants. They call it multi-lingual, and it is for the first few pages. Unfortunately, the next 1100 pages are entirely in Italian. Therefore, this guide was worthless to me."
2,Multilingual ?,If you are content with a translation of the symbols this is OK. But if you don't read Italian you are going to miss a lot of the descriptions because it is all Italian.
2,Mediocre at best,"This book basically gives you the watered-down rehashed MSDN version of .NET socket and network programming. This is a 350 page book attempting to cover all aspects of this subject including remoting and the structure of the .NET libraries without getting into much detail in each one.A mere 18 pages is devoted to server side socket programming, but even that is packed with so much fluff that a programmer winds up with too little information to implement an regular TCP socket server, much less an asynchronous one."
4,Sparse but well constructed,"This book is an introduction, not an advanced text. As such, though, it gets into several details, and draws together the concepts of .NET network programming fairly well.It does fall down in relating the .NET system to that of other systems, such as PHP on Apache, which would be helpful in a book like this that covers so much without much depth...let's see better where the .NET concept fits into the world.It does fall down on the asynchronous web services...in fact, the example is like a programmer printing out a fraction of a project and saying, ""Yeah, just read this."" But in all, a very useful read for the newbie or the administrator needing a top-down perspective."
4,some gems but mostly old stones,"Koch uses so many other writers and his own refined method to push the writer in two different ways. The first part of the book focuses on what we so often need: motivation. He's not afraid to tell the reader to put down the book and get to work. Sometimes this is exactly why I turn to books on craft. Koch certainly motivates, but when he turns finally to craft he stumbles some. It could be that switching modes is difficult for the reader, but he can only lay out so many edicts, so many quotes from other writers or books on craft, before everything begins to sound familiar. There are some gems there, but they are hard to find among so many plain ol' stones."
3,Like an English class,"This book is more comparable to, say, an English class than a writers' workshop. As an English class, the author relies mostly on classic works to cite examples of good writing - rather than taking the writers' workshop approach that is usually more hands-on. For this book to be effective, you'll need a good understanding of which method works best for you.The material offers a very basic introduction, much of which has been covered in other books of equal or better quality over the past few years."
1,unrecommended,"This book is nothing more than 300 pages of strung-together quotes from famous authors. It does nothing but induce irritability. To read it is like being at a cocktail party, trapped in the corner with a very boring name dropper. There's lots of information and the speaker seems interested, but in the end it's not very illuminating and about as interesting as a shoe."
5,One of the best books out there on the craft of writing,"This is one of the best books on writing I've ever read. I highly recommend it. I'd give it 10 stars if I had the option.What another reviewer states, as ""name-dropping"" is actually research. Anyone who has ever written a term paper knows this. In order for the writer, Stephen Koch to include all of the facts and quotes, he had to find them. I thank him for writing this book and for doing all the research required to take it to a higher level. As the back cover states, "" If you can't get Vladimir Nabakov, Virginia Wolfe, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez together, The Modern Library Writer's Workshop gives you the next best thing."" The quotes from great writers are inspiring. They bring the writers alive.Like notes from a great writing workshop, I'll continue to re-read this book. This is definitely one book I'll keep accessible on my desk.If you are interested in other books on writing, I suggest Natalie Goldberg's Writing down the Bones."
3,Okay Tan!,"I purchased this product because of the reviews AND I love NARS products. This bronzing powder provides a nice ""tan"" look. I probably won't purchase it agan. I'll try something else."
1,pressed powder not so pressed,"Within 3 days the compact fell apart and crumbled, however the other pressed products that I carry in the same case are still together, and not completely crumbled, so I know it was not how I was carrying it, but that this product is not a good one."
3,I thought it was a darker shade,"I have a skin really white and when i put this procuct in my face rarely seen, but i think the products NARS are amazing !"
3,Not for me,"I am a caramel skin tone and so I thought this color would give me a sun-kissed glow, unfortunately it is the same color as my skin. I like NARS products just picked the wrong color this time."
3,Best bronzer but it breaks a lot,I LOVE this bronzer but I am on my third one now - apparently it is defective and the makeup cracks and breaks inside the case. Take it back and they should give you a new one..
2,spares the rod...,"I agree with the over all review given prior, except with the amount of stars giving. Because this is the only recording available is not a good reason to give anything above a two. The poor quality of the recording and the generally poor quality of the preformance are often painfull to listen to.I consider myself a great fan of Sir Arthur Sullivan's music and have yet to hear a piece that I didn't like as long as it is preformed well and the sound quality is decent and this album falls short on both counts.Sadly many who listen to this cd will be listening to this opera for the first time and turned off from it for all the wrong reasons.If you wish to buy this cd to simply own all of Sullivans works on disk than buy it but if you wish to own it for listening enjoyment than save your pennies."
2,"Good as a reference, but Not a programming guide","While this book is a fairly good reference, it certainly is dreadful as a programming guide. Little things annoy throughout, such as the author constantly mentioning new topics only to cop-out and say ""see Chapter X for more details"". Some sections have this at the end of every paragraph, which makes is read like 'stereo instructions'. Also, while most programming books are quite dry, this one takes the cake for most 'sleep inducing'- it is a stream of information with no mention of possible uses or implementation. As an ASP/VBS developer I thought it would be easy to move from VBS to VB, but not with this book. Avoid if you are new to visual basic!"
4,Everything a GLBT Theater Major--or just the Curious Might Like To Know,"Academic read is a bit dry, but the revelations about homosexuals and their influence on American Theater history is awesome!"
1,Sorry I had to give it one star,"The replay unit is Wonderful! However, I would never buy it again and will avoid all Panasonic products in the future. If the romote dies, you can no longer use the unit. There are no replacement remotes available and the company does not repair them. This ranks right up there with buying a new car because of a flat tire. JUST DON'T BUY THIS!"
2,TIVO vs REPLAY,"I have both units and the TIVO is much better. The TIVO remote is so much easier to use as well as the screens and navigation. I find the REPLAY remote far more complicated than necessary. Both units have the same record time but I tend to use the TIVO more often. Luckily I paid very little for the REPLAY so it's a good value for what I paid ($200 new). Even though I pay 9.95 a month for TIVO, I feel it's a better product."
2,What the product information didn't tell you,"This book is a history of Long Island (NY) written in the 19th century. The pages are direct copies of the original publication and the antiquated print and flowery language of that era remain in this reprint. For real history buffs, it's a gem, but I have a masters degree and found myself struggling to push through the language and print. I'm not done with it yet for this reason but I'm planning on plugging along."
2,Bland Tamales,"I bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday present. Thankfully, I bought her a second present as well, because these tamales turned out to be utterly underwhelming. They were bland and tasted mostly of corn meal. The only one that had a little taste to it was the mushroom one. If you get these, I recommend pouring on some hot sauce. The tamales were also quite small. I suppose I've never had true tamales before, but these were nothing like what I expected. They came frozen solid were squished flat. They were about 3.5"" long and 0.5"" thick. You would easily have to eat a whole package of them to feel full. Of course, that's not a problem, because they're all frozen into one giant block, resulting in your having to peel them off of one another unless you want to eat all six. The only good thing was they shipped on time and in a nicely packaged box with a large chunk of dry ice. I'm never ordering these again."
4,surprisingly good,"this is a solid effort for a 50-year-old rocker! the band is excellent, w/ the outstanding simon phillips on drums, pino palladino on bass, and the julliard orchestra directed by michael kamen. townshend and the ox make cameo appearances, as do linda perry, david sanborn, and the chieftains. the sound is carnegie hall golden, and roger sounds like he's still got some left."
3,Another Celebration?,"The concept of this is good...Roger Daltrey traveling about to do Townshend's song, especially with orchestral backing, and some guest shots.This tour pretty much ground to a halt in the US due to low ticket sales, but when it was going had its moments.The arrangements for the symphonies are quite good, and you hear a very different quality from some of the Who's most powerful rockers. Also, hearing Daltrey do his version of ""The Sea Refuses No River,"" a Townshend solo track was interesting.Pete shows up for ""Who Are You,"" but he, Rog and Entwistle never actually get together on stage.Another rub: the best stuff was left to the TV show! Daltrey, joined by Entwistle and Chieftains, and John's thundering acoustic bass work...why was that not here?!?Linda Perry shows up to growl her way through ""Dr. Jimmy,"" but that was kind of take it or leave it.In any case, a show that started with good intent and was ground down, perhaps under the grandiose planning."
5,A Great Disc For The Who Fan,ROger's been singing Pete's songs for most of his life and this is a great and grand release. Highly recommended if you are a Who fan. Baba O'Riley is a highlight here.
5,Both of my children love this!!!,"I have an 11 year old and this was his favorite book when he was a tot. I also have a 15 month old and it is now her favorite book!!! It is so cute and they both love hearing the repetitive ""Not the Monster!"".. I Highly recommend this book!"
2,"Overpriced, But What You Gonna Do?","I managed to lose my USB cable for my Olympus DS-2 and was shocked to pave to pay 21.99 for a replacement. (I only paid 70 for the recorder!)While this price was competitive, I don't think it can be justified.By the way, I found my missing USB cable 2 days after the new one arrived."
2,It's a good Idea but...,"It's difficult to see the 3-D... and some people don't see anything 3D. I was proved with my family and friends because I thought the problem was just mine.The pictures are beautiful, but I just can see in 3-D one or two of them"
4,A Must-Read for every teen.,"Althouh this book doesn't apply to every woman, every woman should read it. Two therapist friends who happen to be male found it very enlightening as well. It can provide courage & confidence for the teen approaching womanhood."
5,What your Doctor never tells you,Eye opening. We all complain about the high cost of medication by the author went the extra step and teaches how we can reduce our costs. I am giving my copy to my doctor's office so they can share this valuable information with others
4,A well written guide to packing with llamas.,"I've read every book on llama packing that I could get my hands on. This one gets my nod. It is more concise and well-written than other texts on the subject, and deals with the details of food, equipment, and pannier organization quite well. The pack-trip checklist at the end of the book is well conceived. This book is probably the most up-to-date of the books on the subject, but it does have one bit of outdated information: it states that llamas can begin to carry packs at the age of two, when in fact the new consensus is that they should not begin to carry significant weight until at least the age of three-and-a-half."
4,a good place to start llama packing,"Although I would like to see a new, updated edition, this is still a great book on llama packing. It is concise and easy to read. It even comes with some good recipes."
5,what a way to begin the Millennium than with Teresa!,"Being a collector when I saw this Teresa,I thought it was one of the most glamourous of the Teresa dollsto come out in along time.She is one of my ""pride and joys"",of the Teresa doll collection.Mattel really went to great lengths on this one"
4,Beautiful Holiday Keepsake,I was fortunate enough to get both the Celebration Theresa and AA Barbie on ... this site. These are beautiful dolls to display during the holidays or all year round. I would consider this doll more appropriate for a collector and not for heavy play because the dress might get ruined.
4,Great looking doll,"Great doll!!!!the glitter comes off the gown, but still she is very pretty and for this price!!!!!she is a steal."
3,Great Stuff!,"I saw this movie in Cannes and I thought it really kicked butt! It was a bit too long and sometimes drifts into comedy, but overall it was great stuff. The fight scenes are nicely shot and edited and they just keep going and going (which is what you want isn't it?). Fans of the genre have a treat in store for them. Get this one while you can and you can say that you spotted these guys first before everyone else jumps on the bandwagon!"
4,Hollywood Just Got It's Butt Kicked!,"Yep it's true. Come in Hollywood your time is up.Jackie. Jet. Woo. Stand aside.I kid you not. This film has to be seen. Made for a 100,000th of the budget of your average Hollywood movie 'Left For Dead' boasts some of the most spectacular action you will see this year or any other.First time director Boyask keeps the action coming thick and fast.It's funny script, solid acting and dramatic storyline keep you entertained when the action lets go...SEE THIS. Rent it. Buy it. JUST GET IT NOW!"
4,Really Enjoyed This...,"With less stars than a cloudy night and less money than half an El Mariachi, 'Left For Dead' arrives on a wave on a few good reviews and very little else.But don't be put off... this is a funny, action packed (oh god so much action, my head hurt by the end of this film) low-budget epic... this is what us Brits call 'a beer and curry' movie.Meaning? On a Saturday night you get a beer, a curry, sit in front of the TV and switch off. And by that standard there are few better films...If your looking for high art, big budgets or production values look elsewhere. If your looking for a good, fun and enjoyable movie then here you go!"
3,I enjoyed the film...but thers something fishy going on,"I really enjoyed the film, some of the fighting and acting could have been better, but overall it was entertaining...but I think I should mention that there seems to be something a little fishy going on here....There's a review on here from a 'P.Hobden', claiming to be a satisfied viewer of the film...and there's a guy called 'Phil' Hobden who's a Producer on and actor in the film, and one of the managers or something in the production company who made it. Seems like a pretty big coincidence to me! Hmmmm!"
5,AWESOME!!,"I like laughing at friends who said they got a good deal for $125. This one works great. I have removed my 37"" INSIGNIA TV many time to run different componet wires behind the TV and through the wall. This bracket stays strong and is what I expect to pay for a hidden piece of metal mounting equipment."
5,Awesome wall mount,"This product is OUTSTANDING. It's so simple to install and works like a charm. If you spend more than $45 including shipping for a TV wall mount then you're just throwing money away because this one does the trick. We hooked up a 32"" Samsung LCD and it couldn't have been simpler. The wall mount spans over 2 studs and the brackets easily mount into the tv. In fact it's so simple that my 17 year old son did everything and this was his first ""home project"". I will say that the directions could be a little better but the simplicity of this makes up for it.One last comment - I never write reviews because of the time it takes, although I should due to the fact that I like to read them. But in this case, I had to make an exception. I HIGHLY recommend this product. Finally, I oredered this through ERSE and I received it in 3 days using standard shipping. I'd use these guys again in a heartbeat. Very professional."
1,What?????,"$3.50 sounds like a decent price. When the item was placed in my cart the price increased to $11.40. I didn't review all the prices for each item in my cart. When I received the pakage and invoice I discovered the shenanigans. It was too late. Amazon said I could return shipment, but I needed the item and it was such a small amount of money when you add up shipping to and from my address it was not worth returning. What a rip-off!!!!!! Keep your eye on any purchase made through Amazon from Grizzly Tools(The marketplace seller in this case). Thanks Grizzly."
5,It works like a small piece of steel should.,"This piece of steel successfully adapts 1 1/4 to 3/4. What else can be said, it's pretty too?"
3,"Cheap, arrived quickly, but not a quality piece of furniture","It's okay for the price. However, there are cracks in the white paint where the wood seams meet. Also, one of the knobs is unattached, I'll have to glue with wood glue. So, it depends on what you're looking for."
1,Sherlock Holmes 3 video Collector's Set,"I am sorry, but bad prints and Extended Play do not make a collector's set. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful series of movies, but it deserves to be sold in Standard Play. I find the EP format and less than adequate picture to be in insult to my viewing enjoyment."
3,DVD of designer,"Some good views of his building designs, but shot like a casual home video; traffic noise and vehicles,, etc. No evaluative comments. Would like to have know of the home-shot production."
5,dental aid,"this is a great product for those who need something to clear up infections in the mouth, teeth or gums"
1,Shipping charges,"Amazon is charging me $30.69 for shipping even though the title clearly states..""Free Ground Shipping"". While on the phone with the Amazon support people there are giving me the run around about it being a third party seller and I need to contact them about the shipping charges. But that company isn't charging me the shipping cost.. Amazon is!."
4,"Great funk rhythms, and potty music!","Weopon of Choice is one of the best unheard bands of the last 5 years. They funk out and offer up some of the most interesting party music since Fishbone bit the big one. Sure they sound like P-Funk, Prince etc. But they mix in a healthy dose of Frank Zappa. Furthermore, Finn Hammer is one rockin' guitarist!"
1,Just us Volks here,"Schumann attempts to portray ordinary, day-to-day life in Nazi Germany, but has so very little to say about the fervor with which so many ""ordinary"" Germans adored their Fuehrer and embraced his ""philosophy."" No Holocaust here, folks, nothing to see but what's cooking and the top ten on the hit parade. Only the brown eye is weeping."
5,FABULOUSLY EXCELLENT !!! :),"This book COMPLETELY changed my life!!!! It is THE book to read to have a HAPPY relationship and a HAPPY LIFE!!! You don't need to read any other book once you have read this one!!! Beleive me!!! It is pure, inspiring, and very uplifting... and yet so helpfully ""practical"" and easy to apply!!!"
3,Skeeter Davis,"Although the CD is quite good, Skeeter's versions of some of Buddy's songs are rather unusual. I think her versions of Dolly's songs are better. However, on the whole, the CD is pleasant to listen to."
3,I only bought this one because of the box cover!,"The DVD cover of this one shows a pretty blonde and a pretty brunette close to eachother, and since I love scenes involving pretty women together, I took a chance and purchased this one. Yes, these two women engage in a love scene together, and it's a pretty nice scene, too! But it's the only one, and it's poorly set up. The best part is when the blonde girl kisses her way down to the brunette's beautiful derriere. The rest of the DVD is all guy/girl scenes which were only so-so at best. But notice that they didn't put any of the guys on the boxcover because that would have hurt sales."
4,German workbook...Deutsch Aktuell Level 1,"Excellent on sending out the book ASAP. I actually wanted the text book, not the workbook, but that was my fault. Getting the workbook, it was in excellent shape. No complaints whatsoever. This sender was fabulous!!!"
2,"Okay, not great","This is a nice size for a reptile cage, because it fits nicely on an old changing table my kids have long since outgrown. It took a little effort to put it together, but that is reasonable. I would give this cage more stars if the door fit better. It looks like the holes for the hinges were drilled just a little bit off, so the door hangs at a slight angle. It separates from the base by a very small amount - about a quarter inch at at bottom of the door on the latch side. That small amount is just enough to let crickets escape. I don't want crickets in my house, so I move the chameleon to a terrarium to feed him, and now that I think about it, it is just stupid to spend this much on a cage that doesn't completely keep the inhabitants inside. So I just took away another star. I'd advise the R-Zilla guys to drill their holes more carefully, and inspect their work before it ships out.Except for that little problem, it's a pretty nice cage."
1,Waste of my money,"In my opinion, I found this book to have some of the ugliest handbags / purses that I have ever seen. I have no desire to recreate any of them."
1,Uninspiring and ugly,"Not a single bag style that I would recreate, I had started making handbags when I bought this book for inspiration, big mistake. All of the bags look like home-ec projects (and not from the talented kids) in unattractive colors and fabrics. The patterns are not cute or trendy, and I struggled to pick out even one good tip I could use. If you're the type that likes to wear sweatshirts with embroidered kittens and flowers on the front you might like this book, if not, don't waste your money."
2,"Tips, not patterns","You don't want to buy this bag if you are looking for handbag patterns to follow. The bags are ugly, but some of the design elements can easily be modified to make something a little more fashionable. There are some decent construction tips, which was the whole point of me buying the book."
1,Dont bother to order!,This book is not that great. It is the same purse pattern (fold over flap sack type bag) just has differant designs. Many are for people that crochet... I dont!! And it doesnt' even show how to crochet. What a waste of money... I sent it back!! I did read all the reviews and orederd it any way. Take heed... don't buy it!!
2,Ick,"There are some hideous bags in here. I bought the book for tips on sewing handbags, not for patterns luckily. The handbags features are more of a fiber art style, not fashionable. There are a few decent tips on construction, but nothing too fabulous."
1,So Many Ugly Purses,50 designs from many people and most are UGLY. That is quite an accomplishment. The one on the cover is OK so you hope for the best if ordering site unseen. The advice to check it out in library first makes sense-you'll never buy it if you do.I also don't want to make a single bag in the whole book and the instructions on the few I read through leave alot to be disired.
4,"This is a very good product, though...","ReplayTV or Tivo. You may be thinking about it.If you want to see closed-caption to enjoy watching movies, get a Tivo. I could not make my ReplayTV work to display closed-caption and that was the only reason I exchanged my ReplayTV (Panasonic) for a Tivo (Sony). For non-native English speakers like me, it would be a very important difference.However, for other capabilities, I liked ReplayTV more. It has two RCA inputs, much better program search function, faster program database import, more functional (a little bit confusing, though... :) remote control, etc. Tivo's software may be more eye-catching than ReplayTV's and better for novice users (Tivo's IR setting is actually better than ReplayTV's) but not powerful as ReplayTV.Again, if you need closed-caption, get a Tivo. Otherwise, get a ReplayTV."
4,Long-term Reliability Poor?,"Replay TV is really the coolest thing to hit the TV market in quite a while but the reliability of both unit & remote is not great... We've had this ""TV enhancement"" for about 2 years and it's down right now. On the good side, TV watching has been completely under our control, including elimination of network broadcast timing/day, etc as well as the magic ""replay"" and ""skip over the silly bits"" buttons!!Despite the constant useless messages about ""call failures"", clunky data entry (keypad select/click vs a REAL keyboard) and the crummy image quality, the system is worth every penny ... Online connectivity to your box is also super cool, letting you tweak the record settings when you're away. ... Enjoy it if you have one!"
4,Your comparison of TiVo and RePlayTv misses important points,"Your comparison of TiVo and RePlayTv misses important points:1) With TiVo you have to pay for the program guide service, with RePlayTv you do not.2) TiVo is limited in how long you can freeze/pause a live broadcast, with ReplayTV it is only limited by disk capacity.I really can't understand how a ""web"" company would do a comparison that is just a long bunch of text. No ""quick glance"" feature comparison table or chart??? Who has time, or desire to read a novel to just compare two products!!!!! On top of that, you missed two of the most important comparison features, but had a whole block of text on the difference between the spacing of the buttons on the remote control!!!"
5,A very good read,"First of all this book I dont think is a stand alone book. Originally this book and Magicain Apprentice were one book just called Magician. This book concludes where Magician Apprentice left off. Pug, in Kelwan, and, Tomas in Elfandor. This book brings up conflicts for Pug because while living in Kelwan he becomes a ""Great One"", or a magicain of high social status. Actually these guys are untouchable. But when he under went his training he developed a loyalty to the world that is at war with his home world, Midkemia. Tomas on the other hand is having trouble making the transition form a human to a god like being. In Apprentice he received a gift from a Golden Dragon, for keeping him company in his dying hour. This gift is armor, once worn by a Dragon Lord named Ashen Shugar. This armor is kind of addicting, Tomas sleeps in it, eats in it, doesnt ever take it off. In this armor is the essence of Ashen Shugar, which is trying to take over Tomas body."
5,"Active, inventive, and fun!","Magician: Master, is one of my personal favorites. The unsuspected leaps and turns around every corner hook the reader nearly immediately. An inventive book with a great storyline and excellent imagination, especially if you read Magician: Apprentice."
4,Satisfying conclusion to the epic saga,"This was a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga begun in Magician: Apprentice. Feist is a competent writer and he does a good job of creating a world and filling it up with a colorful cast of peoples and creatures. Although I thought this was very good, I thought the first installment was a little better. I was more interested in Pug, Tomas, Roland, Carline, et al, as they grew up together at the Keep in Crydee. In trying to keep up with the details of the war between worlds, Feist occasionally lost sight of the superb characters he so intimately brought to us in the first installment.Feist sets the plot at a nice pace and despite the length of the two volumes they can be read relatively fast. Overall, this was entertaining and a worthwhile addition to the fantasy genre."
4,"Good, but drawn out in some parts","I love books like this that deal with an individual who has an inner power to do good for his people, and even manages to have a few girls with him... The most exciting parts about the book are the battles and heated discussions included in it. At times, though, I found myself reading on only to get back to the parts about Milamber. I you like fantasy books or are interested in becoming a wizard, read this book, because it is good most of the time."
5,Masterfully Crafted,"I think that anything I could say here has already been said, but this is a great book, and better yet a great series. I just like to get my opinion in with a rating!"
2,Ugh...,"Are we talking about the same book? This book stinks! I felt as if Mr. Feist rushed through most of this book, I mean, there were enormous gaps when years and years would go by and he hardly mentioned what happend. The ending gets REALLY annoying when everyone and their mother starts saying how much better a king Arutha would make. UGH! The last chapter is just lame. Horrible ending."
2,WHAT IS ALL THE FUSS?,"I have to say that I do not understand why so many people think that Fiest writes fantastic books. I think that his stories are aimed at young adolescents. He is in no way, as good a Science Fiction as Tolkien. Maybe his next book will be okay."
2,This is not a page turner,"Rather than growing the story further. The author created subplots that are really pointless, particularly the diatribe on this dude who want's to be king, thus affecting the war effort. But seriously, who cares. Readers want to read about how the battle between the good guys and the bad guys turns out. Not waste 50-100 pages on how the good guys are bitching about each other.And naturally, the protagonist - Pug. After getting captured, get's trained by the enemy, absorbed into the community, and elevated to a level where he is 'above the law'. I mean, seriously, the logic is pretty flawed.The ending was wrapped up pretty quickly as well, and naturally, against surmounting odds, the same old formula of a 'saviour' appearing from no where that cleans up the mess and saves the day was used."
4,"Wonderful, Gripping, Imaginative.... PERFECT!!!","it was wonderful, the characters all interacted perfectly, in a gripping saga set in an imaginative world... the tsurani, greater & lesser path magic... magneficent and perfect!"
3,"Ok, but not nearly as good as the first book in the series","I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the first book in this series, Magician: Apprentice, and was hoping for more of the same out of this book. However, I found that I didn't enjoy this nearly as much.I thought this book was a little too light on actual plot and spent too much time on the mystical transformation of Pug into Milamber, Tsurani Great One.If you liked the first book in the series, you'll probably want to read this one as well, but don't expect it to be as good."
2,not a master,"feist invests a lot in making the character's personality, at this he may be one of the greatest masters. but the plot? the seemingly invincible people are turned into fractions fighting each other. there is not enough old fashioned action here. i expected much more. there's just a lot of the character's reactions as they walk around trying to fulfill whatever's expected of them. their adventure is never really that interesting. feist is uninventive, taking a little bit here, a little bit there."
5,Best Book Ever,This is probebly the best book i've ever read. Except for the other books by Feist no other book even comes close to the greatness of this book.
5,Read Lord of the Rings? This is the college version!!,"The Entire Riftwar Saga, by Raymond E. Feist---Don't forgetthis name!! This 4 book series builds with almost nothing inthe way of fast happenings... It builds like quality foreplayto that perfect conclusion: the satisfied reader!! Hints ofhappenings dropped in the first book suddenly appear in the4th book... never a loose string dropped: and there are many!Everything throughout the 4 book series is interconnected.The plot pulls along a beginning reader, drawing them intoa fascinating web of intrigue that continually builds...To the college level readers... well you'll have to read theentire series several times to catch the hundreds of nuancesthat pop up and connect not just in one book, but the entireseries. If you read Lord of the Rings when you were youngeryou MUST READ THIS ENTIRE SERIES!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,BETTER THAN TOLKIEN!!!!!!,"The best fantasy story I`ve ever read. I have just finished reading The Riftwar Saga for the third time, and I still want to read it again. This is SUPERB!"
3,Magician: Master,"Since I have read this book previously and enjoyed it, I felt like I'd be in for the same treat. Unfortunately, this series is failing to live up to what I remember it to be. Pug as a slave and a Great One was great. A powerful plot string and an intriguing look into another culture. Every other plot line in the book, however, failed to interest me. I skipped entire sailing and pirating sections of unimportant travel, as well as overly descriptive battle scenes. Tomas' plight was interesting, though having known what happened previously, I failed to pay too much attention. Some books benefit from multiple points of view, this one did not. With Pug being the only character deep enough for me to care about, I failed to enjoy glimpses of anyone else. Hopefully the secondary characters will gain a little more life and interest in future books, or I'm not reading for much longer. For Pug's journey alone this book is worth 3 stars, barely."
5,With great power comes great responsibility,"The orphan pug, once apprentice to the magician Kulgan, is taken from his home to another world, Kelewan, as a slave along with his boyhood friend Thomas. It is then a great order of wizards called the Black Robes discover the potential of pug's abilities and teaches his the order. Now called Milamber, he learns of a great evil that is eager to destroy the world he now serves, and his distant home world Medkemia.One of the best novels I have read of this nature. The plots are very deep and rich. You follow main characters from boyhood to maturity and bond with them as they continue their adventures. Get lost in a world of ancient magics, evils, gods, and noble deeds."
1,Utter cr@p,"""Blecky Yuckerella"" is a series of one-page, four-panel vignettes in the life of an ugly, disgusting and sick-minded little girl. It's crude. It's mean-spirited. And creator Johnny Ryan obviously believes the toilet (and its associated functions) to be the greatest source of humor known to man.Sure, toilet humor can be chuckle-worthy in the hands of a talented writer, but there's nothing creative or original here. There's nothing remotely funny -- unless you're the sort of person who f@rts at parties to impress members of the opposite sex. (It hasn't worked yet, has it? Think about that.)This slim book should be easy to overlook on the shelf. Do yourself a favor and be sure you overlook it.By Tom Knapp, Rambles.NET editor"
2,Fourth Grader Approved,"When I was in middle school, I wrote a story called Poopy Man, about a talking piece of doodoo who fought evil soap and my nerdy classmate Andy. I would also write scatological stories about Oddworld that were badly misspelled on purpose. Blecky Yuckerella is about equal in quality to those stories...I love gross-out humour, but it has to be more mature than these simplistic jokes. (I'm over 13, but am writing as a Kid's Review for anonymity.) Try reading a bizarro book instead."
3,Very Spacious!,"This is a very spacious sleeping back for someone that's over 6-feet tall like myself. I can actually curl up in side of it completely! I can even move around inside of it. It is very warm. My only complaint is that the one I received had a hole in it. I ordered this 2 days before our camping trip. It arrived an hour before we left. The hole was discovered when I went to sleep that night. By then it was too late to think about a return - I NEEDED a sleeping bag! So, when I returned, I simply sealed the hole with an iron on patch. That has since started a ritual of ironing on or stitching on a patch from each park or state I have visited. Aside from that hole, I have been very happy with the quality and warmth of this sleeping bag. I like that I can buy a second one and join them together to be a double (and a HUGE double at that!)"
1,Didn't work wellness,These clips did not work with my eaves for hanging Christmas lights. The clips wouldn't stay attached so we returned them.
2,NOOOO,Okay it's portable whoopdee dooo..The battery doesn't last long and it's too small to do what I want it to do.. But if you're a newby then it might be for you..
1,HORRIBLE,"This DVD is absolutely horrible. The production quality is terrible and the narration is practically incomprehensible.It looks as if someone ran around on a cloudy day with a hand-held camcorder and shot vacation-quality videos. Finally, the colors are completely washed out, and most of the shots are taken on cloudy days, and this choice of weather exacerbates the inherent poor production quality.FYI - I returned the DVD to Amazon for a full refund.Please try these Amazon DVDs on India instead:1) The Soul of IndiaThe Soul Of India2) Ancient India: A Journey Back in Time (Lost Treasures of the Ancient World)Ancient India: A Journey Back in Time (Lost Treasures of the Ancient World)3) Warrior Empire - The Mughals (History Channel)Warrior Empire - The Mughals (History Channel)"
4,A compelling story told well,I read this book in two sittings instead of one only because I had to go to work. McDougall skillfully weaves a tale that quickly engulfs the reader. I have to admire the way one is led from sympathy for Sergio and Gloria to revulsion and a thirst for justice. This book demands an epilogue.
2,Exciting subject--boring coverage!,"I started into this book, and then read the author bio to see if this was some vanity or self-published project. Instead, this guy has been published by heavy hitters like Esquire! And I drudge away at my hourly writing job...How can a book about a sex scandal be so uninvolving and...blah? Sure, it's well researched--in fact, it's more like other people's thoughts simply cobbled together--but where the spark, the grace that you expect when you shell out $25 bucks for a book? Nonfiction doesn't mean styleless!!I finished it, but it was a chore..."
5,His feature exposes the truth behind the scandal,"Superstar Gloria Trevi was finally freed from prison after being cleared of rape and kidnapping charges, and intends to act and release an album, so ""Girl Trouble"" will be the perfect announcement of her return to stardom. Trevi was accused of masterminding the kidnap, rape and brainwashing of nearly a dozen teens in Brazil: Christopher McDougall is a journalist determined to uncover the truth, and his feature for the New York Times Magazine exposes the truth behind the scandal, tracing Trevi's involvement in the sex-slave scandal and in the music and acting worlds."
2,Blah,This is a really interesting story. The writing? Leaves a LOT to be desired and turns the otherwise incredible subject matter into a boring mess.
1,Not the most enlightening book - but quite interesting,"This book seems to have the quality of a washing-up liquid advert. This seems summed up by its complete lack of depth in philosophical implications. It is about as stimulating as having an intellectual conversation with Jerry Springer. Please, Please, Please don't read this book!"
5,My Go-To Cookbook,"My friend gave it to me 12 yrs ago and it's still my go-to cookbook. I love French cuisine and this book offers both country and contemporary fare. Although there are some recipes that are time consuming or require a lot of ingredients, there are many recipes I can whip out in 30 minutes with a few ingredients from the frig. In fact, the reason why I came across these reviews was b/c I wanted to find other cookbooks by the authors. I highly recommend this book even if you have to get it used."
5,THE BEST EVER FRENCH COOKBOOK,"THIS IS THE MOST WONDERFUL FRENCH COOKBOOK,WE HAVE TRIED MOST OF THE RECIPES AND EVERYTHING WE HAVE MADE HAS BEEN FABULOUS. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL COOKBOOK WITH GREAT PICTURES AND EACH RECIPE IS EXPLAINED IN PEREFECT DETAIL WITH PICTURES TO HELP.I THINK ANYONE WHO LIKES FRENCH FOOD SHOULD OWN A COPY OF THIS BOOK, I'VE EVEN PURCHASED COPIES FOR MY FRENCH FRIENDS"
3,Begs for color photos,"Hard to imagine what author and publisher were thinking to not have color photos of a train makeup that was all about style, design and color. Decent read if your into a time gone buy."
1,Tisserand,"While these shears look really neat, they don't work as well as the stainless shears I've had for over 15 years and only sharpened once. I was very disappointed as I paid as much in freight as the shears cost. I found out the Tisserand shears that I purchased before were a different manufacturer and no longer made.Live and learn."
5,Finisher,"In case you didn't read my other reviews of Ribbed and Studded Condoms to which I wrote (and pasted below) that I needed a 'finisher'.These are those finishers.Super smooth, and very sensitive - almost nothing onboard. I like them.Definitely buy againHere is what I said about studs/ribs:These are good.""For those slow and sensual session where you both want to feel the subtle slow sensual warmth of each other, these will work.But when you decide to pump up the speed and get your self to the finish line... I felt desensitised - which for some may be a very good thing, but not for me. When I want to arrive, I want to arrive, and these kind of kept me from the edge.To the point that I eventually took it off and slid into something thinner. Ahhh that did the trick....So yes - these are great."""
4,Taste Great !,No spermicide.No bad after-taste.Would highly recommend .Less filling - Tastes great !!!Nothing more to say .
5,It worked well.,Met my expectation and satisfaction. It's great to use when I have period because when I have period I don't need extra lubricator...
3,"Down in the Boondocks, tiny book","I was a little disappointed in how tiny the book was. I remember reading this book over and over and over to my nephew when he was little.......it was a regular hardback book then. However, I was thrilled to be able to get it to give to his soon to be born baby boy. He was excited to get it. Thank you."
3,"well played, but the songs don't shine","As a long time John Martyn '70's' fan I'm slowly but steadily delving into his later work and this is one of them. The sound quality is fine and John's singing and playing is excellent as well. His sidemen are fine musicians so all should be well, but I found these recordings not as enjoyable as the earlier live recordings I'm familiar with and it has more than a little to do with the arrangements: apart from the start, with John playing solo, the subsequent songs are very akin in texture and feel with a loss of individuality as a result. The ubiquitous presence of the saxophone especially I find somewhat annoying as this instrument generally quite often and certainly on this recording seems to flow over the music like treacle.As you may have gathered this is not a top notch recording but well worth checking out if you're a seasoned fan."
3,Good Purchase,"The tent was very easy to setup and put away. We experienced a full day of rain and had a minor leak, but that was due to user error - we hadn't wrapped all of the velcro around the poles, causing the rain cover to come into contact with the tent.We have a family of 5 - two average sized adults - man 180, woman 130, - three children, age 7,3, and 2.With two queen mattresses, we pretty much used all of the space. I was a little disappointed in the fact that the rear of the tent rose sharply from the floor to the roof, causing us to have to move the mattresses closer to the entrance way, otherwise the people on the two ends would have come into contact with the tent (raincover not over that area too, so could forsee problems).Ventilation was fine. Without the user error, the tent stayed dry.Really only a 4 person tent."
3,What were they thinking?,"The package on this tent leads you to believe it is rectangular. It isn't! It is six sided and totally strange. We got it set up and couldn't believe it was right. It still looked totally weird. You have to stake the tent on all it sides for it lay flat. It uses three poles but the two main poles attach to the tent two inches apart in the back. When you attach the tent clips to the poles it seem to pull the fabric a lot. There are no windows, so it's probably good for rain but not if you need ventilation. We've had lots of tents and had a little trouble putting this together the first time just because it is so different. I would not have purchased this tent if I had seen what it looks like set up."
2,Works fine until you make prints with picture kiosk machines,"I was given this Olympus M Type 256MB xD Picture Card as a gift when I received a digital camera for my birthday last November. It worked fine until last week when I made prints at my local Kmart using the xD picture card. The card is now 'dead' and no amount of reformatting will fix the problem. It's very disappointing, as I'd only had the card for a little while. There is no visable dirt or damage on the card or the gold 'heads', so I can't be sure if it died because it was damaged by the picture kiosk machine or because it was faulty. Either way, please beware of using this Olympus card in picture kiosks lest your card befalls a similar fate."
1,Olympus xd not compatible,This M type XD card was not compatible for my olympus camera. a waste of money. make sure you check your cameras compatibility with these cards.
1,A second opinion,"I have to disagree with the glowing account by the first reviewer who seems to be overwhelmed by the switch from the narrow inch and a quarter to the two inch. Yes, a two inch diagonal is far better, but not this one! Yes, the optics appear to be passable, but the construction of the frame is cheap and only marginally workable. The cheap plastic collar is at best three threads deep and thus only barely screws onto the visual back or reducer. When one loosens the diagonal to rotate the eyepiece, it is very easy for the diagonal to completely fall off and drop to the ground along with your expensive and heavy eyepiece. It is hard to believe an engineer would produce a product with such minimal threading, even for this low price. Spend a lot more and get something worthy of your scope!"
2,Yawn!,I don't understand why the previous reviewers gave this album such high marks. It was bland at best. Another run-of-the-mill no hit wonder.
2,Nothing Special,"The girl's voice was the only thing that got me through the whole CD. If these people can get a recording contract, I'm signing my Golden Retriever up for guitar lessons tomorrow."
5,Awesome Hendrix..a must own!,"To any Hendrix fan, especially anyone who has seen the film of the same name, this CD will be a real treat. Now we know how cut and choppy the film was! There are even two songs here that the film completely cut out, including a beautiful (HEY BABY)New Rising Sun. The band, although performing at 2:30 AM plays exceptionally tight, and Jimi is in great form..having fun even though exhausted! Of course, you must also get the film..if for no other reason than to see Jimi perform RED HOUSE. I defy anyone to find a better version! Watch as he starts out the song very shakily, even cursing at himself..but then slowly begins to find his way and nails every note brilliantly as only Hendrix could play. Awesome. Get this CD and the DVD."
3,Not His Best,"I love the man but this is definitely NOT his best. By all accounts, he was exhausted when he finally took the stage, he was beset by technical problems throughout his extended set, but the real problem here is Mitch Mitchell - usually a fine and vibrant drummer, here he is simply awful and why Hendrix allowed him to do not one, not two, but THREE drum solos I'll never know. Still there are several highlights here, the blues of Midnight Lightening is haunting, and the band offers up excellent versions of Dolly Dagger, Spanish Castle Magic, and the masterful All Along the Watchtower which make this worth having in your live Hendrix collection - but not before the BBC Sessions and Live at the Fillmore."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Very sloppy very sad........He is very tired and very out of it.The songs drag on and on.Machine Gun is long and painful to listen to.If you want a good 70's era hendrix concert I suggestBerkeley, Rainbow Bridge, or Isle of Fehmarn(Fehmarn is actually VERY good.Even though he was booed at the beginning, he lets loose and preceedes to blow minds. YOu can buy it off dagger records.)All that glitters is not gold and this is one of those items."
3,Not a good performance,"I have always thought this concert was a downer and it still is after remastering, remixing and repackaging.Was a sad way to see Jimi go."
5,Getting over the Style Wars!,"Reggie Kidd's book is the most helpful on my shelves of worship books that helps me see Christ, musical style and our mission as worshippers in a healthy perspective. Kidd's metaphor of ""Bach, Bubba and Blues Brothers"" is not only refreshing, it is helpful. My own worship planning and personal listening includes elements of each.I was a student of Reggie's while this book was written. The book could have come to market several years earlier, or at least people in the publishing world thought so. However, I think Reggie had to go through personal tragedies with his father and the family dog so he could bring these chapters together. The fruit is a good read that will give you lots to chew on. I heartily recommend this book."
3,Picture doesn't match description,Make sure you read the description as this is for 12 clear bottles. It isn't for what is shown in the pictures.
2,Safe and Unoriginal,"The Quality of production appears to be there but it is a relatively uninteresting listen...safe and unoriginal. It feels as though this album was produced by IKEA...and yes the directions and nifty do-it-yourself tools are included. But hey, if I wanted to do it myself I would have.I recommend this album to all newly graduated college students just stepping into their first corporate paycheck of security who feel they have reached enlightenment in the halls of health benefits and 401k packages..."
2,Nothing like their older stuff,"Man, what's the deal with the breakbeats? They are cool for a while, but this disc has them in almost every track! And they are all played with the same drum sounds! I only like 1 track from this entire disc and I don't even like it that much. Now that Cubanate has good distribution they decide to change their sound for the worse: why does that seem to happen to so many bands!"
3,Country Heartbreakers Cd,"Country Heartbreaker cd from K-Tel contains only two original recordings, track number 1 and track number 8. All others are re-recorded. Most of the re-recorded tracks sound good. However this import from the Uk is not your best buy if you are looking for the original recordings......Note!! Sound quality very good."
2,Expensive text with a vague introduction to VB.NET,"It is not my nature to write a negative `book report', but this book (and the Advanced Programming Using Visual Basic.NET - by the same author(s)) does really not deserve the price. This text is full of poorly written vague explanations, the OOP terminology and coverage is watered down to bare minimum. The exercise section in this text do need more work to be understandable and to be more generic to work on the Visual Studio 2003 environment.The code reviews in general are superficial and unorganized. The reader/student is presented with chunks of poorly explained material like in the database section for example, where very little detail is given on the how, why questions, that goes beyond the mechanics of clicking and dragging data base components.There are a lot better texts available for a less price.The ""Visual Basic.NET Primer - by Jack Purdum"", book is a great, clear introduction to programming and to Visual Basic.NET for far less price."
5,"Very Good, even a beginner can handle it","very detail, concise, easy to follow steps and it is not as technical as some computer textbooks that I have to deal with. Highly recommended"
3,didnt work too well for me...,"This moisturizer definitely feels pretty good but because it has the salicylic acid in it, after you apply it, you may see skin begin flaking and drying off. This is good at first because you want your skin to peel off, but this isn't the moisturizer to get if you want to apply once in the morning and have your skin feeling hydrated throughout the day. It also says it's good for preventing outbreaks but after using it for a few weeks in the summer I still had one of the worst outbreaks of my life. Now I use a general, light but very moisturizing moisturizer by SkinMedica which I has been great at doing the moisturizing part, but I can't speak for much on the preventing acne part.Overall, I'm sure many people will find this to be effective, but it's probably just as effective to use a salicylic acid blemish remover or toner and then just add a moisturizer that you like afterwards."
5,A hidden Gem ...,"This artist is very heartfelt and paints a picture perfectly . This artist has so many good songs and i can pretty much promise you can relate to them .Check him out on purevolume . He is the hidden gem and you will be pleasantly surprised.A fantastic cd from him is ''two to the chest to remember, one to the head to forget '' . Words don't do any of this justice . You have to hear it for yourself ."
5,Joe Wilson rocks!,"The final album from this acoustic duo, now Joe is doing his solo thing and has his own cd out, you should check that out too... But anywho FLO was a really good duo and the two guitars meshed really well on this cd and Joe's vocals are as heartfelt as ever. I actually enjoy this album more than the full length, which was really just a combination of two earlier eps. I dunno, it just seems the songwriting on this album was more mature and refined. All the best of luck to Joe in his new endeavours and if you read this far then buy the album!"
2,Needs Updating,"While basic HTML is the same, web site design has advanced so much since this book was first published it only serves as a source of frustration for anyone wishing to create a sharp-looking site. It takes hours of reading this book to learn basic information you could otherwise get from one of those HTML cheat cards they sell at the bookstore (which, this book is dearly lacking!). As an earlier reviewer noted, there is little in the book that is Mac-specific, so don't think you need a book that says, ""Mac"" on the cover to learn HTML.The narrative format may work well for someone who knows absolutely nothing about the web. But, it only slows down the reader looking to get up and running fast. If you want to create a cheesy ""retro"" style web page circa 1999, this is your book. If you want to create a professional site, there must be better books out there than this one."
3,What happened to all the courses?!,"You will be quite surprised if you think the 6th Edition of this book will include even more courses than the 5th Edition. The 5th Edition included 6,500 courses and the new 6th Edition has only 3,500 courses. I thought more and more courses were being built all the time. In New Mexico the courses reviewed dropped from 50 to 21. How did this happen? Apparently, only courses with 3 stars or better were included this time. Not only are some courses with less than 3 stars worth playing, but much valuable information was included with those course listings(phone numbers, costs, architects, etc). Granted, the list price for the 6th Edition is $3 less that the 5th Edition, but I would much rather pay the extra cost of having the more complete and up-to-date listings. I would have given the 6th Edition 5 stars if it had the complete listings, but in its shortened version I can give it only 3 stars."
3,golf guide,"not as good as the fourth edition, even the average golf course gets four stars jb in pittsburgh"
2,Big dropoff in content!,The current 6th edition is nowhere near as good as the 2nd edition!there are 700 less courses and no bad reviews.The worst review I saw was 2 1/2 stars.Good thing I kepr my 2nd edition.
1,can't trust everyone.,"I ordered John Bevere's book, Empowered By Grace. What I received from ""adsrus"" was a pkg. of cassette tapes from Joyce Meyer. I spoke to ""Paul"" at ""adsrus"" He apologized for an angry, now fired employee who purposely messed up the order. Paul refunded my credit card and said I needed not send back the cassette tapes. I found out they didn't carry the book after all."
5,Karen's Wish,"It's the best time of year for 7 year-old Karen. The sounds and smells of Christmas are every were. Her happiness crashes when she hers about how her Nannie had a bad fall and is in the hospital. She only has one wish this holiday season, for her Nannie to get out of the hospital. This story is sure to brighten up your holiday spirits. A must read for kids and parents."
2,Fair,"If you are looking for modern music snips from Indonesia, this is not it. Radio Java is a collection of radio snips from 1989! Still interesting to listen to, but not what I thought it was considering the album is new. If you like music from that era and region, it is fine, but this is not what you will hear now, on the radio there!"
3,Decent selection,"I was satisfied with the amount of songs. However the majority of the titles are unknown, not as popular songs, but I still enjoy the cd set. The DVD is also a great bonus."
3,DVD saved the CD,"I'd give it a 2 star if it wasn't the DVD, this album is kind of lame. There is no need to get into the details, the selection is just not that great. IMO I don't see how some of the tracks would be hits... The Annual is getting as bad as what the others' been saying, I have finally felt (seen) it. On the other hand, the DVD is quite a crowd pleaser. I play it on a 100"" projection screen and it's an instant party for anyone, everyone!"
4,Pretty good,"Overall this is a good set. Pretty much what you would expect from MOS Annual. There are few tracks that are flat, but a set worth collecting if you like the previous MOS Annual sets."
2,ministry of sound annual 2005,"i am stunned that so many people seem to like this so much. this is hands down the WORST complilation i have ever heard from MoS. generally, their annulas are fantastic, but this one is utter crap. the songs are hackneyed, the baslines are predictable and monotonous, and the transitions between songs are ham handed and ugly. some are nearly drops. check out the end of call on me on the first disk. they should be EMBARRASED to have produced this. (and the inclusion of a DVD of videos is just stupid. it's just filler. i'd rather have 2 disks and a lower price or a third disk of music)."
4,Great!,"Overall an enjoyable compilation from Ministry of Sound. I tend to prefer disc one a bit more than disc two but both are stellar. Lots of club hits like ""Call On Me"" by Eric Prydz, StoneBridge ""Put Em High"", Nina Sky ""Move Ya Body"", Khia ""My Neck, My Back"", Michael Gray ""The Weekend"", Mylo ""Drop The Pressure"", and more. Disc two highlights include ""Luv 2 Luv"" by Suzanne Palmer, Marly's ""You'll Never Know"", Kaskade ""Stepping Out"", and many more."
3,Sort of a bummer,"i bought this set soley for the DVD... i have a sony DVD player and it will not play at all due to the way it was encoded. it does play on my laptop and desktop just fine, but who wants to watch it on there, right? other than that, i can't really comment on the CDs because i haven't even listened to them once yet. in other words, don't get excited for the DVD to work, because chances are if you live in the U.S. it won't play in most DVD players...booooo."
4,Great cover,"Easy to get over my scooter. Has withstood rain, snow, wind and is still in great shape. Keep my scooter dry."
5,High School student,My 10th grade son was haveing a very hard time in Biology. I got this book to help us study and his grades came up and he understood more.
5,My Lil Tutor,"This book, by far, is the most beginning Biology book you'll probably ever own. Very concise, up to date, comprehensive book that can be used as a supplemental or an a stand-alone."
4,Biology Review,"This is a good review of the basics of biology. I'm also reading the Chemistry, Physics, and Calculus versions of this series. They're all a pretty good review of the basics."
4,not very advanced,"I liked the layout of the book and would have been more than glad to have it back in high school bio. I took college Bio I in 2008, and after a change in major needed Bio II now (2011), so I was looking for a refresher on the basics. I needed more than this book covered, but it would still be a valuable resource for students in high school or maybe college level bio I classes."
2,Garmin Quest II,"It is small and light weight, probably perfect for hikers. I think the battery is supposed to last 5-8hrs away from the car. The software is pretty versatile and it lets you do a lot. My biggest complaint is that it is very slow. I'll be typing in a name to help filter my destination choices, and if it is more than 5-10 miles away, it takes forever for it to show up. I end up not knowing if the destination (say McDonalds) doesn't exist nearby, or if I just spelled it wrong. Additionally when I pass up a turn I don't want to make, it goes into ""Recalculating..."". Then it finishes in time to tell me to turn right just as I'm driving through the intersection....""Recalculating..."" again. I think she does it on purpose. This product would probably be fine for anyone who drives at half the speed limit."
4,"Excellent out-of-box functionality, but..","I bought the Quest 2 after researching all the Garmin products, plus the products from Magellan and Dell (Dell's PDA/GPS is not going to be continued).I was literally able to open the box and set up the unit on battery power. The maps are pre-loaded, so finding locations is a matter of setting state, city, and address. Everything has worked, mostly..The but part..the documentation is not as complete as I'd like it, and some things, like how to charge the internal battery (or if it can be charged), are nonexistant.I mapped a trip to my folks in Arkansas, and it did a lot of recalculating when I knew the shortest route and it didn't. And it had their house on the wrong side of the road.Locally, it had me turning onto streets that didn't exist.I will look for map updates (and hope they exist) in the future. I'm a month into ownership, and so far, I'm impressed."
2,Tooooooo Sloooooooow!,"Disappointed. It works great in the suburbs if there aren't a lot of streets close together. Way too slow calculating/recalculating in larger towns and cities. Also, my unit's antenna stopped working after a month. I bought an external antenna and it works fine, but I bought this unit for the compact size. I wish I bought something else."
4,Great comapct package,I bought this GPS about a year ago and absolutely love it. I use it on my motorcycle as well as my car. It works great. The only drawback to it is that it sometimes takes a while to calculate route changes. It comes with the software needed to plan a route and that works great to plan trips on my motorcycle. I would recommend this product.
3,"Garmin, old technology","This Garmin works fine. However, it is very slow in recalculating a missed turn. Not as user friendly as a touch screen. I would not have purchased this unit if I had tried a touch screen first! Over priced for its features."
4,Motorcycle use,This unit is perfect for motorcycle use! It mounts to the handlebars and talks through your radio. It is shock resistant as well as rain tight.
5,"Great Seat, Goes Anywhere",We really love having this chiar. We take it everywhere and it fits every seat in every resturant. Its great for travel and grandparents houses to. Its very easy to clean and very sturdy. The model we currently have does not have the toy attachement but we will be purchasing this model for our second child!
1,Not worth the money!,"We returned this product. Amazon was great about refunding our money. Fisher-Price customer support was not so great. The belts on the booster were assembled incorrectly and they insisted that's the way they were supposed to be but the seat was not functional. The woman on the phone was rude and not helpful at all. Also, for a booster seat intended for use through the toddler years it isn't very big. My daughter isn't fat but she isn't a petite baby and she would only be able to use this booster for a few months. The tray was difficult to use. The toy was cute but not worth and extra 20 bucks. After returning this booster we bought a much better one from Safety First and we're very pleased with it. Don't waste your money on this booster!"
4,Love Little Audry!,"My Children (ages 2 and 4, and even their older siblings 8 & 10) love this movie they watch it over and over. I was searching to see if their were any more so I could get a break from the Gingerbread man story! We love it!"
3,Little Audrey,I purchased this Vhs version thinking it was a Dvd. The cartoons were classic rhymes that brought back fond memories as a child. Although there were parts that had static I found myself trying to fix the tracting on my Gran's Disney Tv but overall she wanted to see it over and over again. It did arrive quickly however but gave it a three star because of the little parts that were jumpy/with static.
3,William Girdler Strikes Again,"William Girdler director of Grizzly and The Manitou goes off into the forest again with Christopher George and Richard Jaeckel.This time due to the depletion of the ozone layer the animals tend to go a bit crazy and start attacking people.Starting off with a bunch of people going for a hike where one by one they are slowly picked off not just by the animals but also by the Leslie Nielsen character who seems to go psycho , he ends up taking on a bear (might be the same one from Grizzly)single-handed which of course he loses against.The kind of movie you put on a Sunday afternoon with a box of popcorn and have a few laughs with.It is a shame William Girdler died so young , I do believe he would have become a major Hollywood director in time as can be seen in some of the shots done in this film and Grizzly."
2,Guilty pleasure: but horrible transfer,"I have to agree with Gary's review on the quality of the picture. Disappointed doesn't even begin to describe the simple lack of effort restore the picture and sound. The colors are washed out as well.Considering this was from Media Blasters and Shriek, who did a fine job with Zombie, this is even more sad.As far as the film itself, I remember seeing it for the first time when I was 11. I enjoyed it then as well as now.For those who look to purchase this, be forewarned of the poor presentation. It's a real heartbreaker."
3,A place in history for DAY OF THE ANIMALS,This film is entertaining on a B-movie level. But the real reason to watch this movie relates to its place in cinema history. It opened in theatres the same day as STAR WARS back in 1977. Which film did you see that weekend?
4,Cheesy 70's Shock-fest,"I remember greatly enjoying these films from the 70's. You know, the bad acting, the cheesy special effects and the 70's morality and last but not least all that really big hair? Well Day of the Animals does not disappoint. You've got a group of clueless newbs taking an overnight camping trip in the wilds despite warnings from the local sheriff and their Native American guide that 'thing's weren't quite right up on the mountain?' Can you figure out what's going to happen? No, then surely you haven't watched enough B movies. Pretty much the animals have gone crazy because of a virus caused by the depletion of the ozone layer. This virus controls their minds and make them attack humans. As the hikers are picked off one by one, its like an episode of survivor all over again.No, seriously, this was a fun film. No its not rocket science but its cheesily entertaining. 4 stars."
1,Utterly boring,"This is definately one of the most boring ""thrillers"" to ever be made. Nature runs amock from man's incessant tinkering with it, and a group of hikers are conveniantly cught in the middle. No gore, no surprises, no scares, just complete boredom. If you ever wondered what it would feel like to beat time to death slowly with a spiked club, see this movie."
3,Girdler curdler.,"It's somewhat unnerving watching this with the cat on your lap. I had a stun gun ready in case it got any 'ideas'.BE WARNED: The two transfers have the euphemisms 'pristine' and 'vintage' applied to them on the back cover. Unfortunately, the latter was the 2.35:1 print I'd been looking forward to. It is quite terrible with scratches, crackly sound and a chunk of dialogue missing. Perversly, it is a sharper picture than the 1.85:1 transfer which is matted fullscreen. I guess if nothing but a battered print of the cult classic 'The Hills Have Eyes' could be found, one shouldn't be overly surprised. Curiously, Girdler's 'The Manitou' has a great R2 DVD release, but maybe that had studio backing or something.This is a childhood flick that seemed harrowing at the time but is, ahem, less so now. Nevertheless, it's still a lot of fun and thoroughly nasty. Worth catching for the flying rats and the demented scenes with Leslie Nielsen."
4,"Memorable, Haunting Entertainment.","A great cast of familiar faces make this above average viewing. It is great to see the talented Paul Mantee in one his best screen roles since the 1964 classic Robinson Crusoe On Mars. Likewise Michael Ansara, Richard Jaeckel and Ruth Roman.For those used to seeing Leslie Nielsen the comedian, beware.Also good are Christopher George and Lynda Day George."
4,When Leslie Nielsons Attack!...,"William Girdler's follow-up to GRIZZLY, DAY OF THE ANIMALS (aka: SOMETHING IS OUT THERE) features pack-hunting mountain lions, bone-crushing grizzlies, ravenous wolves, hellish hawks, flesh-plucking buzzards, sinister rattlesnakes, and rats that can leap 10 feet! However, the true star of DOTAs is Leslie Nielson as the odious hiker gone feral! He intimidates, threatens, beats up others, kills a guy, and attempts to rape a gal hiker! You see, the ozone layer's been depleated to such an extent as to cause the animals (including Nielson's character) to attack and kill all humans! Watch this one as part of your next ""nature's revenge"" film fest!..."
3,Leslie Neilsen tries to punch out a grizzly bear!,"If the ozone layer vanished,many scientists have theories about how this would effect life on Earth. I guarantee that none of these theories comes close to the one put forth by this movie. Turns out that when the ozone goes, all the animals on the planet go ICKY-BINGO and band together to wipe humanity off the face of the planet. It's not really dynamic but it is fun watching cougars running through Denver's suburbs scaring crossing guards, mailmen and dogs out of 10 years growth. The best part though, is when crazed hiker Leslie Neilsen goes kamikazee against a murderous grizzly bear. He actually tries to bite the beasts ear off! Needless to say this is a very short,but entertaining scene. There is also an attempt at drama and inter-personal tension, but luckily the creators never try too hard with that part of the film."
2,supernatural shlock-fest,"Leslie ""Airplane!"" Neilson plays forest ranger Steve Buckner, who winds up in a world of trouble in the mountains of the Sierras after a tear in the ozone layer starts messing with the minds of animals who live in high altitudes. Wolves, bears, dogs (every dog has his day!), and even an addled owl pose terrible (and unintentionally comical) threats.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Good but could have been great,"This album is good, but not as good as their other cds that I listen to religiously (chasing daylight, self titled, somewhere more familiar, and fortress). I'd honestly give it a 4/5, but the reviews are really biased by the extreme fans. There seems to be a general reduction in the instrumental complextiy and vocal variety/harmonies from their past albums -- lots of basic guitar parts and little vocal variety. I know that they are better musicians than this! Each song starts out good, but then don't really go anywhere. The refrains always seem to disappoint and are not catchy -- they just seem 'off'. With a little more work, I think that all of the songs could have been great, instead of just consistently pretty good. Also considering the poor mixing (see other reviews), it seems like this album had great potential but was rushed, perhaps for a holiday release. It's worth buying, but not as your first sister hazel cd."
4,Sister Hazel CD,I had looked in local stores for this CD and could not find it. I knew Amazon would have it and they did. Shipping was fast and reliable. I am very satisfied with the CD and the purchasing process.
3,Beat a dead horse,"Tye felt like he was living in Joe's shadow. Joe had died but , everything around him had once been Joe's. I think the author made her point well enough without over killing it. I am an intelligent avid reader and I got it the first thirty times she mentioned it in the story. It was distracting and made what could of been a lovely story annoying. Awell written store makes you feel what the character is feeling without continually stating it. I have liked most of Cheryl St Johns books but this one was disappointing."
4,Not one false step....,"I loved this book. Very sweet story dealing with the very honest emotions and insecurities that would come with trying to fill the shoes of a beloved deceased spouse. There was not one false step throughout the whole story. When the h or H had an issue, they talked about it. It wasn't a long string of misunderstandings. The characters were consistent in their actions, no one was TSTL. No contrived plot devices.Very well done!"
5,Congratualtion on another one!!!!,"I just finished reading Joe's Wife about five minutes ago and it is fantastic! I love it, I had tears in my eyes at the end. Cheryl has such a rare and special talent....the power to weave such a passionate and wonderful story with characters that are so easy to fall in love with. Characters who are come alive on the pages and paint themselves with ease into the story. *smile* It's my favorite of all the books she has written so far,I really loved it. I started reading it when I needed a break from studying, and it was my intention to read three chapters that was around 6:30 around 8:31 I finished the book without realizing what time it was. After page one I couldn't put it down. I didnt even realize how far into the book I had gotten until I had read the last page. *smile* Thank you Cheryl for writing another wonderful book."
1,"If you have to watch it, rent it, don't buy it.","I got this (the original video release, not the new DVD release) for my wife for Christmas a few years ago because she really liked the movie ""Beauty and the Beast."" We watched it once and came to the conclusion that it is not suitable for our children until they're older. Our kids are older now, and we still haven't bothered to get it out of storage."
4,It's fun but dont be misled,"If your a fan of the Quake series and are looking for an interresting and fun single player experience this game will satisfy. Overall it is a good storyline and mixes things up enough to stay interresting. Dont be misled about the multiplayer aspect of the game. It blows! It's like a really bad rendition of Quake III arena and in fact uses some of the same maps but is horrible in comparison. Players move slower, the graphics look bad and it just doesnt have the fun feel that quake III arena did."
2,Pretty much DOOM 2.5,"Take this with a grain of salt because I'm only a few hours into the game, and I'm always tough on games.I paid about $12 for this game used and I feel a bit taken. The graphics and mood are almost exactly like DOOM 3, but all of the fun has been bled from the game. The Strogg are not creepy, so the dark moodiness of the game becomes more annoying than anything. The story simply doesn't exist. The cut scenes are horrendous (think N64 style in-game graphic cut scenes). Everyone has the same face and Forrest Gump haircut. The weapons are so generic it hurts. The sound and music seem like an afterthought. Finally, the frame rate drops during almost every action scene.All that said... wait, no. I have nothing positive."
2,Doom 3.5,"In a nutshell, picture a not-so-scary version Doom 3 with an incredibly awful framerate, cheesy story-line and graphics on par with Doom 3 for the XBox 1. After seeing Call Of Duty and even PDZ on the 360 I was incredibly disappointed with the graphics on this one. If there are more than 2 enemies on the screen, the framrate slows to an incredibly choppy rate. The sky looks like a low-res jpeg wallpaper image. I'd expect this stuff on PS2 but not on a launch title for a triple-core processor system. It almost seems like this was developed for Xbox 1 and at the last minute shifted to the 360 to have another launch title. The AI is pretty dumb, they'll stand next to exploding barrels and do little to avoid your gunfire. Also, you can't melee attack or throw grenades. That is incredibly stupid. I like the Doom 3 engine so its not a total waste to me, but as a supposedly 'new' Xbox 360 game this is a total waste of time."
4,Another great fps from ID!,"This is another great fps from the masters of sci-fi and horror shooters, ID. It is based on the DOOM 3 engine, so the graphics are exellent.The only thing i find frustrating is your squad always sends you to do the work. You never get a break OR A HEALTH PACK. But still a great game. In the top 10 of the 360."
3,"Some fun, but no spark","This is a straight shoot-em-up game, with some interesting graphics and other elements, but the excitement never reaches terribly high. The levels are pretty much repetitive and not too creative. Not much of a Halo-like game, but still enough trigger-finger action to keep you from being too bored on a rainy-day."
4,"Again, not perfect but no cause for tears.","This game has some major flaws in it. However, the game is incredible looking and is pretty dang fun to play. There is this really high standard currently called Halo. If you are not Halo or better than you are a disgrace. Quake falls into that category. It is less than Halo, but is it a bad game? Nope. Is it still a fun frag fest shoot em up? Yep. Is it beautiful. Definately.Bottom Line: Should you buy this? Yes if you can find it used on ebay or in a bargain ben in a few months. Then what should I get now? Perfect dark without a doubt."
4,Dont understand.,"I see that for some reason a lot of people are finding fault with this game. I dont understand what the problem is. The graphics are great the game play is pretty intense most of the time and all the weapons are here. The main complaint that i see is that it is a ""mindless shooter"". Well it is a first person shooter just as the others in the Quake series, the Doom series and the ever popular Halo is. I for one find this game better than Halo but then again i like Doom 3 better than Halo. So i would rate this game as i have a 5 out of 5. For those who do not enjoy the FPS games and want something different perhaps they should by something other than a First Person Shooter, after all the shooting is what we love about the Quake games."
4,amazing but...,"the graphics and game play are amazing, but i had one problem with it, when i wanted to play with my girlfriend it turns out i couldnt, only one player unless theirs a system link or Xbox live, but a great game for any die hard Quake fan, and plus you get Quake 2 which i thought was a great bonus, wish they could have done that with other games"
2,Rushed.,"While the graphics are on par with Doom and the game play is entertaining, what could have been a solid FPS has been ruined by buggy code. The frame rates are a major problem in this game. When people compare it to a slideshow, it is not an over exaggeration as it does get that bad if you are near a couple of enemies. The game also suffers from freezing problems, mostly when loading a new map. This makes me feel like the game was rushed out the door without the needed time for testing and debugging. For $60, this is unacceptable. The bonus disc, which contains Quake II and features about the making of Quake IV, was a nice touch.If you are not a Quake addict and in dire need of a solid FPS, I would recommend Prey. Its graphics are on par with Doom and Quake, there are no freezing problems, and it is evolving FPS game play."
4,Used Quake 4,"I bought this used form Twin Cities pawn. It was shipped and received in a timely manner, and the disc quality was excellent. It also came with all the booklets and the bonus disc that a lot of times is left out when bought used."
3,Halo plus much gore minus much of the fun,"Let me start off by saying, I LOVED all the quake, doom, duke, serious, hexin, e.c.t type games. But this game just doesn't cut it.Pro: Fairly long game if you play it on hardest difficulty.A good twist here and there to keep me interested in the storyline.Plus, you get a Quake 2 port. It's almost exactly like the pc version.Cons: The graphics suck.It lacks a good multiplayer.Stupid looking weapons.Halo wanna-be.Bad voice acting.Too many ""almost died, now im seeing stars"" moments.The AI is almost as bad as Black Ops.The Quake 2 bounus disk has achievments.... worth 0 points.I can think of many more things to complain about with this game, but I would be here all day. I give this game 2/5 stars (stricly because it has a interesting twist, and it comes with Quake 2. My first video game EVER.) Rent it off of gamefly, unless if you just REALLY want Quake 2 THAT badly."
5,Quake 4,"With what im about to say keep in mind that im a hardcore gamer. i play games not for the graphics or story. but for entertainment, and personally i found Quake 4 to be extreamly fun. on the harder difficulties i found it to be quite challengeing i love the weapons and the weapon upgrades. which is what makes the game so fun to me. the baddies are pretty cool, and also upgrade as the game progresses. like others have said, its just mindless monster blasting action. and i still play it to this day. (dont mind the horrible spelling)"
4,Cute renditions but the title is a little misleading,"I bought the CD set in order to get the song, ""Mares Eat Oats"" and assumed that the spelling was just different. However, that title song is actually a choral ditty saying that ""Mares Eat Oats"" is a silly song. If it weren't for that disappointment, I'd rate this CD set 5-stars."
1,full bright spot lasts 5 or so minutes then 12-15 recharge is required,led's to indicte status of battery don't work. red/yel always on. green led meaning full charge never lights. spot run time is 5 minutes or so then you must recharge for 12-15 hours. you may reduce life of battery because charged led (green) never lights. you cannot kep charger plugged in when light is not in use. I purchased 3 ea and returned all for a refund. very disapointed in Blak and Decker and their support group.
2,Don't waste your money,"I have a 500,000 power light that is twice as bright and last longer. Even after a full charge this light dimmed to the same brightness as a 2 D-cell battery light. I am not happy with it. Suprisingly my 500.000 power light is made by the same company, Vector."
1,Vectorlite,I am sorry to say that this product only lasted 29 days. It no longer works at all. The old vectorlite a 1.5m candle power lasted for five years.I do not know about the quality of the new ones but seams cheeply made.Thanks
3,ok,"Just not a great spotlight. Uses a simple 55watt bulb, and 6 volt battery, which compared to other lights, is just not that bright. I should have not wasted my money and just got the 3 million 2 bulb vector set up or the LSI 3800 for an extra 20-30 bucks. The big vector seems bulky, so I didn't buy it. Anyway, it's a waste of money if you are looking for a nice spotlight. Even my old Dorcy spot is better."
4,Like Gold,"I will just say this. Gene was my mentor when I first started singing jazz. He literally taught me proper jazz style and form. To this day, his lessons are still invaluable as far as how to be an excellent performer in jazz as well as other musical genres. He is a REAL jazz cat (not just someone that plays jazz) that knows how to play a mean piano, as well as teach. I promise you, the lessons you acquire from any of Gene's books will be like having a pot of gold. You just don't see it anymore.Clear Days"
2,"Not easy to use, often requires restarts, slooooow.","I wish I hadn't bought this unit. I didn't do my research and now I'm paying the price. Often I must put the DVD in twice to get it to run. I've learned that if the DVD doesn't play, take it out and put it in again. I tried the tape-to-DVD burn feature (looked simple) and somehow recorded a TV station instead. So I will have to re-read the instructions and try again. One other thing to consider before buying...this piece of electronics has the loooongest startup time I have ever encountered. I could start my car and drive a block by the time this unit has turned on and is ready to accept a tape or a disc. How could electronics be so slow?"
2,Questionable reliability,"This DMR-ES46V was my third and last Panasonic DVD player, though my first recorder. I have yet to find one that will last much more than a year, using the device perhaps twice a week. Perhaps a refurbished one for under $150 would be worthwhile. While the functions are good for the price, product life for Panasonic players leaves much to be desired, at least based on my experience."
2,Worked fine until it failed,"Purchased this at Sam's. Used it for 13 months. Of course, at 13.5 months, the power supply fan stops working and it keeps shutting down. Spent a looong time on hold waiting for help from Panasonic. After they transferred me twice (= more hold time), I got someone on who faxed me a form to send in for repair. No offer to extend the warranty. They just made sure I knew I would pay for parts/labor. I will not buy future video equipment from Panasonic because of their phone support and failure rate."
2,"If you're converting VHS to DVD, you better work fast","...because the lifespan of this unit is amazingly short. Plays DVDs and VHS tapes fine and recording (and copying) is fairly easy. Still, it was less than a year before I got an error code on the front panel. I had to send the unit to Panasonic for a $130 flat-rate repair (they replaced the DVD drive, which I found was a pretty common issue with this model). It worked fine for another few months, and now I have an F03 code. Don't know what it is* and don't care; I've had it with this thing. I really need to get my VHS tapes converted over and then I can be finished with this whole fiasco. Until, that is, I have to convert my DVDs to Blu-ray, and then Blu-ray to holocube, and then holocube to brain chip...*Evidently F03 is the code for ""Imperial Stormtroopers in the VHS slot."" Easy fix, but still."
4,Good quality workhorse,"I've had this machine for at least a couple years and it has performed extremely well and it is used every day. I would advise that it does seem to prefer Sony DVD's however, I had some problems with Memorex (they would stop mid-recording) which likely has more to do with the DVD's themselves. The recording feature on both VHS and DVD is simple, recording looks terrific and dubbing from one to the other is as easy as I've ever seen. Since I've been pleased with this unit, it has recently been moved to my second tv as I purchased the newer Panasonic DMR-EZ48V model as a primary. Panasonic does a nice job with these machines."
1,Panasonic DVD/VCR combo units,"No one in his right mind would pay over $100 for a used Panasonic recorder based on the horror stories in the forums. I myself have had 5 Panasonic DMR Combo recorders in the last year.( 1 new and 1 refurb DMR-EZ48, 1 new and 1 used DMR-ES46V, and 1 DMR-ES40V). Four out of the 5 have failed with the NO READ error and the common lens/hub cleaning process did nothing. The only fix per Panasonic support is to send it to their repair center for $130 flat repair (you pay to ship) with only a 90 day warranty!!!!!!! For DIY folks, replacing the DVD drive/PCB is cost prohibitive, if you can even find one. In my opinion, the Panasonic consumer electronics division clearly has no interest in producing a reliable product."
2,Just ok till failed...,Paid big bucks for this thinking I'd get a quality machine. In the 1st place the manual is NINETY SIX PAGES LONG!!!!! Worked ok transferring from VHS to dvd and recording on DVD but there is a real learning curve. Should be simpler than it is. After two years of modest use the audio stopped working when playing VHS and regular channel TV. I would not buy a Panasonic and certainly will not spend as much money again.
1,Worked alright until it died,"I had it for a little over a year and the DVD drive died.We had bought this to copy our old VHS to DVDs and to use as our main DVD player. Our average usage was between once and twice a week.Tuner didn't work that well (we didn't bother using it).SD card portion worked ok for JPG format pictures but nothing else.VHS copy worked fine (software was a little clunky).Panasonic phone support was poor and took multiple transfers to even get someone to agree it needed to be sent in for repair. The DVD drive would no longer read DVDs (the laser would not move on its rail anymore), it needed to be replaced."
4,Nice Boot,"Nice boot, well constructed and comfortable.The upper needs no more break in than a standard cowboy boot.The vamp is lined as is the vertical seam in the upper, the rest of the boot is unlined.The upper is a bit wide, but if you wear boot cut jeans you really won't notice.It fits true to size and width."
5,An interesting and helpful book.,"In this book we read of teenagers living with cancer. How they make it through each day, how they deal emotionally. This book will be very useful in helping teenager who are dealing with their own cancer feel connected, and give them hope."
3,Adjustable upper garage door bracket,"This was an ingenius product that was made with my garage door in mind. Everything was as advertised and install was easy. Also,shipment was better than on time! The one criticism(sp) I have with it is that while trying to adjust it this morning,(fine tune) I couldn't unloosen it because the short carriage bolts were not real square for the square hole in the bracket! After getting it finally to unloosen I went up to Home Depot and bought 2 new ones that fit a lot better. About a buck and a half and $10.00 in GAS!!!! (that's another story).I would still buy the same product and hopefully they will get better made and proper size carriage bolts.Thanks for allowing me to vent!"
4,Celtic art & belief as a living spirit in humanity,"Courtney Davis brings together in his art a deep understanding of Celtic skills & tradition along with a charming ""pop"" sensibility. Before attempting to create Celtic design, one would do well to live with ""The Art of Celtia"" for awhile. Davis presents an excellent compilation of his own works, each one examining a mystery (The Flaming Door, Seat of the Soul, Sacred Water), goddess & god, metaphor (the Green Man), archetype, animal totem or decorative motif (Unfolding Growth, Cosmic Loom). The book includes illustrations Davis created for works about Merlin & Grail Quest symbols, along with excepts of text & poetry from those books. An optimistic book that displays Celtic art & belief as a living spirit in humanity.Bob Rixon"
4,Great Book for Lovers of Celtic Art,"A fantastic book for aspiring artists, or those simply interested in the world of Celtic art! Filled with gorgeous full-colour illustrations, excellent examples of knotwork, key patterns, zoomorohic designs, gods/goddesses, heroes/heroines, plus detailed descriptions of each piece's symbolic meaning. A must-see!"
5,Couple of Kooks: and Other Stories about Love,"THIS BOOK IS GREAT!!! I have always enjoyed reading Cynthia Rylant books because she is a very compelling and expressive writer. I was surprised to find the story ""A Crush"" inside my 7th grade class's reading book. My exact thoughts were oh joy another story that I will like and the students won't but I was proved wrong. The first words I heard after I completed reading the story out loud was ""What happens? Why didn't you finish?"" My students enjoyment of the story has led me to purchase the book and use it as my read aloud book for the next book."
5,...WOAOW. Dat's FRESH !,"I have no words to describe it...it's simply THE best hip-hop CDs I've ever heard. Forget all you've ever heard in your life, and listen to it. This CD is fresh, clean, it sounds great. Your ears will love it. You are fed up with those gangsta MCs,who are all clones? forget them, King Britt has the antidote for your ears. The instrumental is deep and perfect, the lyrics are intelligent, and the voices are splendid. Just listen to the track 3 to have an idea of what kind of masterpiece this CD is...A Fantastic Hip-hop album"
4,a halfway good attempt for a video game based Anime,"I dont own an official copy of this tape but I taped the first episode of it when it came on the Fox chanell back in 1994. Overall this is a really good anime the drawing style has a 1980's look to it. the fight scenes are very well done.The quality of the animation is much better than Pokemon.(even though I like Pokemon) But I do agree the character desighns, plot, ect.. are way off the video game."
3,Mega Man X Emporium anyone,"Mega Man TV show is bland, lacks character development and suspense. Even Dragon Ball( Dubbed and Edited still contained the above content this show lacks.) The best episode was ""The Beginning"". Other than that I could come up with humorous spoofs for these episodes! Yes Mega Man X Emporium is a website made by fans. Maybe you could write some fanfiction instead of rotting you're brain watching this mindless drivel. My advice watch Dragon ball(Dubbed and Edited Version)emphasis on edited it has a strong plot and believable scenarios."
5,Awesome CD.,"Frankie Bones has consistently been known as one of the better DJs around. This album is just a further evolution of his unique talent and mixing style. I would recommend this CD to anyone looking for a good DJ mix, new-comers to the format and hard-core followers alike. Definitely one of the best albums I own, this one's a sure winner."
3,"AKI KAURISMAKI, OPUS 12","*** 1996. Written and directed by Aki Kaurismäki. 5 Finnish Film academy awards and one award of the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. Ilona and Lauri lose their respective job because of the economical recession in Finland. The movie describes their efforts to get a new employment. The film is enjoyable and announces the masterpieceJuha [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Finland], shot the following year."
5,American Singing Groups - Group Harmony,"Great book. Very thorough. If you love Group harmony history, this is THE book to purchase. Jay Warner has done a yeoman's job."
1,"Garbage, with two exceptions","With the exceptions of The Movielife and Finch, none of the bands on this DVD are worth paying to listen to, especially NFG. My advice: save your money, and go buy a CD from Fairweather."
5,drive thru DVD,"This DVD is awesome. The songs on it are awesome, the behind the scenes is even better. I watch it at least every other day. What is really great about it is that you don't have to watch the whole thing, you can just watch The Early November's live performance of Every Night's Another Story if you want. Or, you can skip to the music videos, whatever floats your boat."
4,Drive-Thru DVD is a must see for fans,"This DVD is awesome. The videos are really good, especially for Homegrown and Fenix Tx. There is a ton of other features like live footage from Warped Tour (The Finch song is amazing), interviews, pictures, home video and really funny bonus footage. It's totally worth the 13 bucks!"
5,great comp!,"With over three hours of footage, this DVD comp can't be missed by fans of any of the bands included on the disc (New Found Glory, Finch, Allister, Starting Line, Rx Bandits, Senses Fail, Steel Train, The Early November, etc.)Rock on!"
5,"Good Times, man","This is an awesome DVD. There's some great footage of Allister, Rx Bandits, Home Grown, The Starting Line, and one of my favorite bands, the amazing Something Corporate. However, I think the shining moment of the DVD is one that I almost missed- the 'Angelica' montage which showcases the talents of Steel Train, a band previously unknown to me. Check them out, they are very impressive."
3,"MAXIMILLIANS MEXICO, BY WAY OF ITALY OR SPAIN","Adios, Sabata, isn't bad. Yul Brynner as Sabata isn't bad.Yul's costume in this one leaves much to be desired. His gun also. Both too Campy. But overall this is one of the better Sabata films I've watched, no better, no worse, than the rest.Glad I bought it and glad Amazon priced it so low. Both audio and video is excellent.After all they are ""spaghetti"" westerns and though they may have acted as a template for Clint Eastwood's westerns, he needed to improve on them.However, no one should be disappointed with this one.Roll-film, pardner."
3,camp western,"If the Yul Brynner costume puts you off this western you are missing the entire campy gay feel of this outrageously over the top spaghetti western. Yul struts and spins with his tassels circling him in an over the top parody of Van Cleef or Eastwood. I keep ecpecting him to blow a kiss. This movie is good fun but is also iconic of what brought the genre down with every B star and second string tough guy thinking anyone with an italian sur name can be Leone and they are not. But I still can not help smiling at the gimmicks, the acrobatics, and the costumes. Throw in a few scenery chewers and it is perfect rainy afternoon fun."
3,wrong size mirror,"This mirror was to small for my 93 Acura TL, however my mechanic was able to install for a temporary fix. Had to purchase right size from dealer"
3,cool,without the best of the objective marker it is hard to find where you need to go but still possible. the game is great. charachters are still customizable and gameplay is good even though its previous generation gaming.
2,Buy Skyrim instead!,"I started playing Skyrim and decided that I'd purchase this to get more experience with the worlds involved. I wish that I hadn't, as Skyrim is so much more advanced than this. Kudos to the developers, but I do not recommend this game for anyone who has played Skyrim, the less-evolved gameplay and graphics will frustrate you immensely."
1,hate hate,this game sucks do not buy it stay away is they only thing i can tell you and just get 4 for they xboox360 or they PS3
2,Truth or Not,"I have read this book and just the fact that this book is about my great Grandpa. I found this book to be not informational and it is not a positive biography on him. It is based on stories by the two youngest daughters that did not even really know about what they were talking about. They were young when all his achievements happened and do not know the stories.Most of the history that was written was based on others peoples views of what happened and not factual i would say that this is not a biography this is a fable and as some of the stories are kinda what happened it was written to glorify Deadshot and not just to tell his history. I would recommend that you read the book Raging War "" The Story Of Deadshot Reed""Jessica Reed""Great Grand Daughter"""
4,Thank God for compassionate people.,"This is a great spiritual story. Thank goodness there are people with this much care, compassion, love and kindness for their fellow man. It has made me seriously consider life as a missionary. I will take the lessons learned in this book and apply them to my job as a firefighter/paramedic. I pray that we all may find more compassion and paitence when dealing with each other."
4,"Loved the book, hated the movie","I read this book as part of my education about India before going there with my 19-year-old son to immunize children against polio with the Rotary Foundation. It was an excellent story, although I do agree with some of the other reviewers' comments of glorifying poverty. Since coming home from India, I read the Indian weather reports and think: It is miserable there and I am comfortable here, yet it is not because I am ""more worthy."" I hate temperatures over 85F, let alone being hot AND dirty AND living on the street, as we saw many times. Despite the poverty, though, what my son and I found amazing was the incredible hospitality --- and concern for us! --- by even the poorest people we met.Please also read ""Gdaan: The Gift of a Cow"" and Elisabeth Bumiller's book of India."
5,Beautifully written and moving,"If you've never been to India, this book will take you there. Through the eyes of the main character you will see the beauty and soul of the one of the poorest and richest countries on the planet.I'm going to insist my teenage son read this book this summer!"
1,Disappointing,This book was recommended to me by a teaching colleague. I bought it in Chennai and I started reading it eagerly. I got to the end but I found it an unsatisfying read.The subject was worthy and would normally have held a lot of interest for me but I just found Dominique Lapierre's skills were not up to the task.Perhaps I was spoiled by having already read A FINE BALANCE by Rohinton Mistry which was a superbly constructed book.
3,Only good as a testimony,"A French priest goes to live among the poorest of the poorest in Calcutta, including the people with leper.It is said to be a true story, and then it is a moving account of life in that place, where an American doctor and some Indian people also share these most difficult lives. Lapierre tells a moving message: joy, solidarity, friendship, can be found even in the hardest of circumstances. Love is the only way to overcome poorness, sickness and hunger. While all that is true, Lapierre's book comes to the verge of being a glorification of poverty. As literature, is almost corny and artificially dramatic; as a testimony of what goes on in there and how the human spirit sometimes excels in the midst of harshness, it's good. I'm sorry not to like it much or sounding cynical, especially since I appreciate its message, but it is only a report from dire poverty, not a very good novel."
5,a book of hope,"After reading this book you realize how meaningless our daily worries might be, how every single day in our lives has a deep dignity and should be enjoyed thoroughly. It's abook of hope, which makes you dream of a better world but also gives you the urge to start creating it yourself..."
2,Interesting but maddening,While the information was at times fascinating I did not find myself engaged from page to page. The writing was often far too grating or purple and tended for me to waver between good descriptive factual writing and unimaginative fiction. In all it was a chore to trudge through.
3,Interesting but repititive,Not my favorite Dominique Lapierre book. Try Freedom at Midnight a great book on the division of India in 1947 at the end of British rule. This is one of my very favourite books.
5,A celebration of humanity,"In these days of cruise missiles and stealth bombers,we need to read and read a book like this to return to humanity.A wonderful book that lifts you up on to a pedestal of great joy.If you plan to read only one book this year,this is the one to read.The goodness of this book is simply overpowering."
3,You get what you pay for,"The bed took about 2 hours to put together with 2 people. It came damaged (one of the boards that you lay the mattress on itself had a corner w/ particle board broken off), and there isn't really anything you can do about it. The molding around the bed didn't come with holes drilled into it, but it is soft so you have to force the screws into the molding itself, all the while from the bottom up (hardest part of putting it together). Some screws don't screw in tightly to the base boards. The molding is only held on by about 6 screws on the very edge of a board, and putting any force on it at all bends it/break it.Overall, you get what you pay for. It is made from cheap particle board for the most part, with visible unpainted/uncovered bits at certain places. However it does its job and looks decent. Spend a few extra dollars and buy a platform bed from a local furniture store instead so you don't risk not being able to return damaged goods and can have a real look at it."
4,Nice but alittle confusing.,I bought this platform for my new memory foam mattress. It looks great but was a bit confusing to put together. My brother put it together in about an hour but we did have to take it apart at one point and switch things around. If you purchase this product be sure to take your time putting it together to ensure you will not have rework at the end. Not sure how great it will be if I ever move and have to take it a part and put it back together. It is made of pressed particle board. Overall does the job and looks very nice.
2,Cheap product,"This product (bed) came with really horrible assembly instruction. Some pieces of it were not labeled and I had to use my own instinct and made educated guesses in order to put it together. It came with predrilled holes which was not properly aligned so I had to redrill holes in order to put it together. Overall, it was flimsy material and poor assembly instruction. Overall, I would not purchase this product had I known how poor it was constructed!"
4,Pretty decent platform bed,"The bed comes in a 70+ pound box. Had to help the UPS guy carry it inside, it was very heavy. The assembly instruction is very poor and the pieces were not marked properly. Took around 2-3 hrs to assemble it. The biggest problem with this bed is the top platform extends over the bottom support frame and if you are not careful you might accidentally hurt yourself. Especially if you have kids you need to be extra careful. The top platform comes in 3 pieces which needs to fixed to the bottom wooden frame. After assembly the bed is very sturdy and does not make any noise."
1,"Look elsewhere, spend a little more","I purchased this bed from another online company. In less than a year, it was destroyed. I weigh about 120 lbs, so the bed wasn't ever stressed, however the composite wood splintered where the screws attached and had to be reassembled at least 6 times. Eventually, when a friend sat down too hard on the bed, the boards split in half. I wouldn't recommend this bed at all. I am currently shopping for a new platform bed."
4,Decent bed frame,"Exactly what I was looking for. Assembly wasn't that bad and the box wasn't that bad with two people. Only complaint is that half the wood pieces canes chipped or broken since it is made out of particle board. You can see the damage when it's all out tote her and it bugs me. I took it apart one to move the top piece and it barely screwed back together, so if your going to move it I would suggest buying another design, it seems like its only good for one assembly and that's it"
3,Too low to the ground.,"I wish this product was a little taller. Between this and the 10"" mattress I bought I feel like a low rider."
1,Not good!!!,"I had to return this product after 3 days of usage. Very cheeply made. Don't look nothin like the picture display. None Of the wholes for the screws Lined up,I had to make my own holes. But On Good note, The South Shore Furniture Company takes good care of there customers. So I recieved a full refund"
2,"If you can afford it, skip the particle board and get hard wood","Decent value if you really need a bed. I was able to piece it together fairly easily and it seems reasonable sturdy. That being said, it is not nearly as nice as the pictures lead you to believe and looks quite ""Ikea"". I knew that it was low to the floor, but I was surprised by how short it actually was. Our blankets drag on the floor. The one thing that was a deal breaker for me was the smell. The fumes off gassing from the particle board glue was shockingly strong. After three nights of suffering a low grade headaches and just slight nausea, we moved it into the spare bedroom and just used our old one. It took at least a month or two for the fumes die out. My advice is to stick with plain hardwood."
3,Missing a few things,"This platform is inexpensive (until it is time to ship) and you get what you're paying for. I don't suggest this to a person who moves often, because this a solid piece of furniature once put together. It says that you need 2 people for assembly, which is true. My boyfriend, whom is a carpenter did need my assistance from time to time. The major thing wrong with this product is that it isn't really a finished product when sent out. The headrest area of the bed (generally the part that most people would have setting up against a wall) is without pain. The platform part that the mattress sits upon is also missing paint, so all you see if your mattress doesn't overflow it, is cheap looking particle board. This is nothing that a little bit of black spray paint can't fix, but it is still inconvient."
2,bad platform bed,"the bed was made with poor materials, the predrilled holes did not line up & it didn't come with all the parts"
3,You got what you paid for,Good bed at this price. Not to difficult to assemble. But the materials look cheap. I think it'll be OK for a couple of years but have to be thrown out if I move.
2,Would be average- if assembly was reasonable,"First, though it wasn't an issue for me, the heaviness of this could prove a large issue.The material is extremely ""meh"" but if fully assembled presents a fairly nice look.The BIG problem is the assembly, not because it is complex but because of numerous flaws in it's design. Holes are all in the wrong place so you WILL need to hammer/drill in your own holes or it will not be as intended(moulding wont fit, will look ridiculous ect.).However, the BIGGEST problem is that the moulding can NOT be affixed with nails. The material is too hard, and no amount of screwing or hammering will get it to fit.I have to get gorilla glue and try that in other words, or the moulding will not attach.Good for the price if not for the HORRIBLE setup."
2,DON'T BUY THIS BED,"Ok, its a decent price and its stable. But their are Flaws. One of the boards arrived cracked, one corner was broken off (it was before it was shipped because the piece was not in the box. Also two of the platform boards were cut so that they were longer then the rest. Lastly, if you decide to buy this frame, the last bit of instructions are ridiculousness. In order to attach the moldings it tells you to left the frame up and screw them in from underneath. This frame weighs 115 pounds, plus if you tilt it one way or the other you may break the platform. The boards were so unevenly cut I put a bed skirt on so that the cuts, and the missing molding wouldn't be noticed. Serious pain in the butt."
4,Good bargain! Assy. hard,"Great product for the price. 128 lb. package. Took a little while to put together. The inside boards are finished on one side, not sure why, but that was a little confusing, as the directions did show a finished side. Other than that, directions were easy, but your wrist will hurt from all the screws, as you're not aloud to use a screw driver. But a great piece for the price. :D Would recommend, as long as you have someone to help."
2,Horrible! You must to be a carpenter to install it!,"The title of the review says it all. The bed is nothing but a set of flat panels with holes drilled randomly. None of the holes match. I had to actually take a driller and then fit screws to set it up. I wanted to give 1 star, but the reason I am giving 2 is the only pain was installation. After that, I didn't have any issues with it. But the reason I didn't give more stars for this reason is it would soon be useless for me when I move. I can't imagine myself uninstalling it and then putting it back together!"
1,Not Recommended,"This bed frame is poorly made and difficult to assemble. The holes didn't line up perfectly, and for the last step they expect you to lift the whole frame up to screw the molding on. The frame is so poorly made that I guarantee it would fall apart if you lift it. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money on a nice real wood platform bed."
1,Junk,"We bought this set for our 11 year old daughter and were very disappointed with the quality. Yes, it is cheap but they could have done a little better than this. This thing is particle board JUNK. I think we will have to replace this with in a year or so. Do not buy."
1,Destroyed,"My package came in a destroyed box wrapped in plastic to keep it together. No manual and no hardware to assemble. The middle platform piece is missing a whole corner (about a foot). Called SouthShore and they are going to send me replacement pieces for all missing and broken. I guess you really do get what you pay for, but I really didn't get all that I paid for. Just a mess and some grief."
3,It's Okay,"It was a pretty big pain to put together. And not only that, things keep falling off of it. I had higher hopes for this platform bed."
2,Hard to put together,"Didn't last long. Put it together and than had to take it apart due to a move, and I wasn't able to put it back together again, pretty much fell apart. In the market for another bed now,"
5,Great Bed Frame,"This product is much better than expected. It's very, very sturdy, easy to assemble and looks great. The only downside - watch out for the corners - nailed my leg the first day!"
2,obviously,Obviously this was cheaply made wood is soft and bends with ease had to modify it by using braces and longer screws to keep it together sections not clearly labeled recieved it and all the finishes had at least 1 large area of scratches
2,Very bad construction,I don't review to many things that I have bought but with this project people must be warned. Don't dismiss the other reviews on this project lightly like I did because most of them are correct. The bed is not made well with holes not lining up and not drilled correctly plus the instuctions are not easy to figure out leaving a lot of guessing. I didn't even put the trim on because I had trouble figuring out how they go on and the way it looked for how they go didn't even make sense. Also in the instructions the boards have labels but not even half of the boards had labels on them and the ones that did were hard to find and who uses front and back for terms to label which end of the bed is which makes no sense at all which I had it wrong and had to start from the begining again and turn everthing around.
2,Insanely heavy so guaranteed to be damaged in transit,The packaging was beat all up but was mostly in tact. One of the chipboards for the plat form had a corner broke.
4,"Sturdy and great for the price, BUT poor instructions","I recieved the product on time. It was really heavy. The instructions were a little confusing, but if you look enough at it, you will figure it out. It feels sturdy, and it was a great for the price. Im a small girl, and I put it together by myself with no problem. You will only need a screw driver and about 2 hours."
3,Get what you pay for,"The product is okay but cheaply made. The box is also RATHER HEAVY (200lbs) putting together wasn't to difficult but time consuming and the product is poorly put together as a finished product. The platform looks cool but that is the only plus side in my opinion. If you have to move however the item cant come with you, once assembled you cant disassemble it without breaking so now after my move i have no bed frame."
4,Not bad for the price!,"Bought this for my son who had grown out of his twin bed. It's not the best quality,mostly particle board, but for the price it is descent. We bought it as a temporary bed until we can afford to buy a ""real"" bedroom set for him. He is very pleased with his bed and it is holding up well. I wouldn't recommend it for a long term solution, but if you take care of your purchase, it should last a good while. Great purchase for the price!! It also has a very sleek, modern look to it that makes it seem in style!! My son loves it and is happy with a bed he can fit in!!!"
3,Its ok not to impressed,The platform is very low and not that strong I had to buy better nails and put in up my way cause the holes did not match up on any of the boards it was driving me crazy till I said war ever iMac just put them anywhere
3,"Good finished product, Terrible instructions.","This bed platform looks great and gets the job done at a reasonable price. The instructions, however, were horrendous. The pieces were poorly identified and it was a follow the picture step by step style instruction manual and the pictures didn't even match up. I have put together a half a dozen pieces this week alone, and this was by far the worst instruction manual I have seen."
1,really irritated and disappointed,"it came with no instructions and the material is plywood. very flimsyit was very heavy.once i took everything out of the packaging and was ready to assemble the frame there were no instructions. it looks simple to put together, but I'm not going to take any chances of assembling it wrong and getting injured or it falling apart as I'm sleeping on it.i wouldn't feel safe if i slept on this at night, i think i would get worse sleep.DONT BUY THIS ITEMsave your money and spend it towards actual wood, instructions, and spend a little more on a safe sturdy frame."
1,Wish I could review,My son and I were very excited when we located this bed frame for his first apartment back in August.Since then we have paid for the frame but have as of today 10-22-12 have not received our delivery. We have several back and forth with company. Was promised several times. Sure wish we could knew what was going on with it.
4,all in all good deal,I love this bed. Strong strong wood. Only problem was for me the assembly wasn't clear and I had to figure out myself how to put it together but it wasn't that hard.
1,JUNK: Buyer Beware!,"This is not a functional bed at all. The wood is not what's pictured. It's cheap particle board that warps, chips and breaks with shipping and normal use. It lasted about 12 months -- about as long as a pair of cheap socks. This is a cheap, throwaway disposable bed. I never thought that after I'd purchased this bed, I'd be buying a new one a year later. This purchase soured me on Amazon and Amazon ratings forever."
3,you get what you pay for,"All in all its sturdy and looks nice bit its difficult and frustrating to put together. If you don't have someone else helping you, good luck. The holes for screws don't line up like you would think and the boards for the top of the frame are a pain to get even. However, due to it being one of the less expensive styles...you have to put more work into it. It's a nice looking frame though. And hasn't fallen apart yet ;)"
3,You get what you pay for,"This worked OK for me.I wanted something that looked modern and classied up my room.I must say, although it does look modern, you get what you pay for. It's cheap quality that works. It's a little sharp on the edges, but as long as you're careful you will be OK.It's not top quality furniture, but for the price it worked for me."
4,Exactly what I expected,"This bed does get the job done. It's nice and sturdy and doesn't make any squeeky sounds when I jump on it. There are some concerns about this bed requiring 2 people to put it together, that is clearly not the case. It is however, too heavy to carry it all by yourself. I ended up just taking the pieces to my room individually.The bed is pretty easy to assemble once you can picture the basic layout of the bed. It's not too difficult to figure out. Some of the screws don't match up, but that screws that didn't fit aren't necessary. I'm missing 2 screws, but it still feels like a solid bed."
3,not the best quality for the price...,I found the assembly directions confusing & the fit/finish of the parts leaves a bit to be desired. Sharp corners protrude after assembled even with mattress on it.
4,Exactly what I was looking for...,"A great platform bed for the price. Even after factoring in the large shipping cost, I still couldn't beat the price locally. It was very easy to assemble, although it's a bit heavier than I thought it would be. I added an 8"" memory foam mattress and have been sleeping better ever since.The molding around the trim has a bit of an edge to it, but it hasn't caused any issues so far."
3,It takes great patience to finish it,"Although this book is probably the definitive account of the II SS Panzerkorps in World War II, it uses dry prose and too many sub-units references that make the reader occasionaly to lose his patience. It is very useful tool for someone who wants to compile a study in depth of the two SS divisions, but I would not recommend it to the casual reader. Michael Reynold's book Sons of the Reichcovers the same subject,it is also very good and more readable."
2,Dry reading...,"This book, while detailed, is a very dry read. I found myself getting bogged down with details about sub-units (this book really needed an index for the reader to refer to). The maps are very crudely drawn; I could've done a better job (& I'm certainly no cartographer). Lastly (but not least) I found the translation to be awkward; the text doesn't flow evenly."
4,Moderno y Muy Agradable,"Los trabajos de Jansen Barbieri, y Karn a veces, son todos recomendables y de una calidad muy pareja y buena, y exelentemente producidos. Estos ex-integrantes de Japan han seguido haciendo una musica de muy buenos, sencillos y agradables arreglos, y con los aportes de Takemura han logrado este exelente CD, con ""toques"" casi Ambient por momentos, sin caer en el ""ruido-sin-sentido"", que demuestra que todavia gozan de lo que hoy dia NO es muy comun, que es el Buen Gusto. Recomiendo ampliamente este CD a todos los que habitualmente escuchan musica sencilla pero compleja en su construccion, instrumental, bien producida y sampleada, al estilo Sylvian, Massive Attack, algo de Triqui, algo de Eno, Etc. Unico defecto: nadie canta, sino le pondria 5 estrellas. Si fuera Sylvian, 10 estrellas."
4,Definetly a Sunday album....,"An eclectic mix of Global Communication-esque ambience, jazzy noodling, laid back beats, and a pinch of squidgyness make an ideal Sunday album for those who like a good lie in. Imagine Nils Petter Moiver, but replace the trumpet with spacey Brian Eno textures."
3,decent,"a good beginner sharpening stone. it was a lot smaller than i expected but overall, for the price, its worth it."
2,It is not a Ceramic stone,"This is not a ceramic stone, it is aluminum oxide (with something) sandstone. With real ceramic stone you use mineral oil, with a sendstone - water. Big difference in purpose, method and results."
3,You need to take 3 pills to get 500 mg,"I did not realize when I purchased this that in order to get the 500mg listed on the bottle, you have to take 3 pills. Personally, I would rather just take one pill. If I would have known this, I would have bought another brand."
4,Protect your liver,"Most body builders know this works, it's a common supplament if you take other things that may do damage such as other supplements. This stff has been around for decades as a way to help the liver stay healthy"
1,This product did not help my PMS at all,I tried it for my last two PMS and it had no effect on me. I still had all the PMS discomfort and pain.
4,Softened my cervix,"My midwife told me to take these starting at 35 weeks pregnant to soften my cervix. I believe they definitely did the job! My water broke two weeks early and I was 100% effaced when I got to the hospital. My labor progressed fairly quickly. I can't say it was because of these, but I think they helped."
4,Soften my cervix,These seem to soften my cervix! I was 100% effaced after 4 hours of labor! we used these everynight from 37 weeks on!
2,I must be allergic,"Every time I take this supplement, I get a major headache. I'm sure there's nothing wrong with this product. Just doesn't mesh with me."
3,Didn't help me this time,Used this type of product once before during pregnancy to ripen the cervix. But this time it did not help. Oh well.
5,Works in unexpected ways!,"I have horrible dishydrotic eczema on my hands and I read on a forum that evening primrose would help clear it up. I took this product as directed for about 4 days before I started seeing results. I still take it daily and the results are amazing! My eczema is almost completely gone! I have found that if I stop taking it, the eczema flares up again but it is worth a few pills a day to have relief. I have struggled with this problem for years and it's so nice to finally have some relief. I should also not that I take fish oil and flax seed oil daily."
4,Great Investment,Righteous and Kick A**. The only thing i have seen wrong is the DVD's dont have the most up to date roads. I have had no problems with loud fans or anything. it plays DVD's while i drive in front and back (self installed) if you want to know how to do it let me know. Illegal in some states. or all who knows. dont get caught.You will be happy if you buy it. a bit pricey but well worth it especially if you don't know the area. great for long distance travel.
2,Be ware of problems with the touch screen of the AVIC-N1,"I am a real user of the product, who had bad experience with the AVIC-N1 touch screen. First, the screen went black after about two years of moderate use. After having the problem fixed with a cost of $250, another problem followed; the touch screen is permanently insensitive to the touch at some fixed position. For example, if I press 'S' then it interprets as 'T' because the S area is dead. So there is no ways to enter the correct selection using the screen. It's like there is 10% of its functionality remained. Very frustrated with such a brand-named product!"
2,poor description,"The description didn't say anything about being a bolt mount. It did say it fits all right handed bows, so I thought it was a stick on rest. My bow does not have a bolt mount option so that description was misleading. The only mention of have the bolt was in another persons review, which I didn't read first. Now it will cost more to ship then what I would get back. bummed."
1,Lasted 5 minutes,"This was a waste of money. The arrow kept bending this rest every time I took a shot. It eventually broke after a few times.It really should be labeled a ""toy"" rather than a useful bow rest."
3,It seemed every family had one of these at Sea World,"I picked this set up to use when I took my two kids to Sea World in San Diego over spring break. It takes some practice for a 10-year old to work the unit. You do need batteries in each radio. The belt clip is flimsy with the voices hard to distinguish and decipher. The key is to press the button and hear the beep and then talk. You do need to depress the button in order to hear the person replying.It is not very loud, you have to speak clearly and not too close to the unit. Thankfully there is an off button."
4,Great for beginners,"This is the perfect book for someone just starting out on Project 98 and would like to read in a step by step lesson format. One will learn the fundamentals, but this is not the place to look for troubleshooting or more advanced techniques. For that, I highly suggest Project 98 Bible by Nancy Stevenson."
2,Where can I find,If this Bonanza is not in spanish subtitles... can someone help me where to buy Bonanza with spanish subtitles I've being looking everywhere and I can't find anything please just email me joanna.fernandez@gmail.com thanks
4,BONANZA,"Recomiendo ampliamente el DVD de Bonanza, y sobre todo, para los que no hablamos como yo, muy bien el ingles, ya que viene con sub-titulos en español."
1,BONANZA's great; this collection stinks,"Simply put: Do not buy this or any other bootleg set. BuyBONANZA: The Official First SeasonandBONANZA: The Official Second Season vol. 1released by CBS Paramount; these are the ONLY seasonal sets licensed by Bonanza Ventures and NBC Universal. You'll get all the episodes in this set plus more episodes from the first two seasons, plus great extras including photo galleries, trailers, interviews with creator-producer David Dortort and more. And all the episodes are un-cut, have the original music (including the classic theme song) and look great because they are re-mastered from the original film elements. BONANZA -- the Real Deal -- Rocks! And if you still want official BONANZA for less money -- avoid the bootlegs! -- and getThe Best of BONANZAput out by Artisan several years ago. No extras, but the episodes have great picture and sound quality and are complete and uncut (and have the original music including the classic theme song)."
2,out of date,"This book was ok, but very out of date. It was interesting to see how many businesses and locations have changed in the previous 4 years. Did not work as a guide for me."
3,Blue Wild Angel,"A significant release but I'm annoyed by the editing allowed - ""Hey Baby"" & some of the between song tune ups after ""Lover Man"" and ""Machine Gun"" being examples. Okay, maybe minor quibbles but ...I expected the full unedited concert. And how about sequencing ""Midnight Lightning"" on disc 2 instead of fading it out on disc 1?"
2,One of His Worst Performances,"There are so many other performances out there that merit putting on to CD. Hendrix is just not with it for this show. You are better off buying Live at the Fillmore East. I guess the ""Isle of Wight"" name carries some weight (The Who released a great Isle of Wight performance a few years back). The only other significance is that this is Hendrix' last major public performance, so there is the curiosity factor."
3,Not Jimi's best... (3.5 stars),"While the Isle of Wight concert contains some great playing (as any Jimi Hendrix release does), it is not close to as good as some other Hendrix releases. I do not find myself listening to it very often at all, despite the fact that I am a big Hendrix fan. Certainly there are some enjoyable numbers (a rarely seen live Watchtower, newer songs like Dolly Dagger and Midnight Lightning) but overall Jimi seems somewhat sloppy and tired. I find myself wishing I only bought the single CD. I leave open the possibility that this album may grow on me, but for now I don't listen to it much."
2,The Greatest guitar BUT.,"This cd would never have seen the light of day if jimi was still with us,It is by far the worst concert he ever performed.Jimi was and always will be the best guitarist in the world,but this,words fail me.The Isle of Wight has been released several times in the past so why again ?You at the Hendrix estate are sitting on much better than this.This was jimi at his tiredest and most depressed time.For Jimi's sake and memory,stay away from this release,Buy all the albums Jimi released while he was with us that's all you need to realise how great he was and is.Get Experienced.Stay Free."
2,"Novice Hendrix buyers, BEWARE!","It seems strange that Experience Hendrix/MCA chose this show as an official release over some other great shows (Royal Albert Hall '69, Berkeley '70, Monterey '67). For Hendrix fans, it is about time they finally get a complete official release of this show. But for first time buyers, don't let a fancy marketing campaign and nice packaging fool you. While this concert has some inspired moments and some brilliant guitar work, overall it is a very strained, sloppy, and uninspired performance by Hendrix. Experienced fans of Hendrix will see past the flaws and marvel at the brilliance, but for you first time buyers exploring Hendrix for the first time, consider other releases first. Unfortunately Experience Hendrix/MCA has not released many live albums yet , so the safest bet is the BBC Sessions release."
3,Not Worth the Price,"In a Hendrix biography that I had growing up, this concert was described as one where Jimi essentially ""died"". That may be a little strong, but it wasn't a ringing endorsement either. Loving Jimi as I do, however, I picked it up and hoped it was worth the price. It's not. Sloppy rhythm, poor sound (more from Jimi's guitar/amps than the recording), and messy vocals are some of the problems. After this, I picked up Jimi's Woodstock album for comparison. There is none - Woodstock is far superior (even though I wasn't wowed by it initially). Sorry to say, we may be scraping the barrel on Hendrix releases. Still love Jimi, though."
4,"Hendrix is God, with Clapton as his prince","I first bought this album in 1980, and thought it waspretty good. Now the 'complete' Isle of Wight set ishere. Eddie Kramer has done a fair job on the re-mix,considering Hendrix was having equipment problems. BillyCox & Mitch Mitchell also kept the rhythm section together,and were in fine form.There are moments here where Jimi's guitar-work is trulyinspired. And there are moments when it is sloppy, and a littleediting would've helped. But overall, this was Jimi's lastconcert, so this is all we have. Is it the best...? No. Butas a footnote, this set will do quite nicely..."
2,It's That Time Again,"""Yes it's almost Jimi's Birthday so let's rip the fans off again""This cd would never have seen the light of day if jimi was still with us,It is by far the worst concert he ever performed.Jimi was and always will be the best guitarist in the world,but this,words fail me.The Isle of Wight has been released several times in the past so why again ?You at the Hendrix estate are sitting on much better than this.This was jimi at his tiredest and most depressed time.For Jimi's sake and memory,stay away from this release,Buy all the albums Jimi released while he was with us that's all you need to realise how great he was and is.Get Experienced.Stay Free."
5,love it,this product is really great and is well made and sturdy. fits just about all belt sizes and the leg strap adusts to any size leg. I would recomend this to any and everyone. Who is an aved archer.
3,ok not great.,An affordable way to carry broadheads if you don't want to use a bow quiver. The flaws are the locking system of the quiver to the vertical strap. Poorly thought out. It can only lock with the vertical strap at a 45deg angle like in the picture.
5,Perfect style.,"Our son enjoys archery and wanted this style quiver for Christmas last year. After using it for a year now, our son is impressed by the quality having used it for a year now, and I am impressed by the price."
3,"Good product, but just a little over sized.","The concept is great, but there are a few flaws. First: this quiver is quiet large. Second: the quiver hangs on branches, or anything you may try to climb up or over. However, the hip quiver is a great buy for what I paid for it. It does get much use."
2,too hard to get arrows in,sounded too good to be true and it was. the arrows wouldn't go into some of the slots. would not buy again
5,Hip Quiver,"I bought this for my 12-year-old daughter for Christmas. She thinks it is ""way cool!"" It matches the other archery items she had chosen on Amazon.com."
3,Over sized Quiver,easy to use and it is as described. However it is a bit bulky for those of us of shorter demeanor. Its a bit bulky and over sized.
2,"Not as pictured, doesn't fit","This glove seems to have good pads on the fingertips, but the finger caps don't fit at all. I wear a large glove and ordered a large, and I had to use binder clips to pinch shut half of the finger caps because they were so big. It's like they were made for bear claws or something: my fingers slide right through the holes on the end. The straps that lead from the wrist to the caps are also cut at odd lengths, which means I'm going to have to completely alter this glove at a shoe repair shop, or somewhere else that has a sewing machine capable of punching through leather.The material is also much different than the picture would lead you to believe: It shows a smooth, polished leather, but what you get looks more like costume suede. It's also a light chestnut color, not the dark brown shown. All in all, I'm kind of disappointed with this glove. My money would have been better spent elsewhere, but unfortunately I've already altered the glove beyond return conditions."
5,Important to know!,This is a very informative DVD - not only because of current events (effects of Hurricane Katrina on oil prices and economy). Peak concerns the long-term rate of conventional oil (but also other fossil fuel) extraction and depletion. The question is not if there is a peak of oil but when it will occur. When this will happen this will have a huge effect - not only on our transportation habits but on global economy.
4,Excellent Resource,"The 3rd edition of this text was extremely helpful for me in my behavior analysis course. Word definitions were listed in the back for easy access, if they weren't defined in the text itself. Examples given were very helpful in understanding concepts and a lot of diagrams were given to help those of us who understand better via visual learning. Reviews at the end of each chapter included study questions which were very helpful. It was an interesting read, at least for someone already interested in the topic."
1,Terrible!,"This text is simply awful. It's badly written, sports terrible examples, gives outright incorrect information at times, and includes a full glossary of completely useless definitions. Half of said definitions don't even qualify as valid members of that category - the entries drone on about related concepts and examples without ever defining the word. Even when things are actually defined, they're often defined very very badly or just wrong. There's typos everywhere and even simple math errors. Please don't waste your money and PLEASE don't use this text for any valid course on Behavior Analysis. You'll loose credibility immediately, not least with your students."
3,Well worth looking at,"I've just started using this book as I find myself cooking primarily for myself. The instructions are excellent - the prepared food tasty. This book is not for someone who wants ""on the table in 10 minutes"" but rather one who believes that the preparation is a large part of the enjoyment of a meal. It was written for both the experienced and the beginner and is a wonderful resource. It is not always easy to find ""good home cooking"" meals with ingredients set to preparing meals for just 1 or 2 people. No guessing here. Would not be without it in my kitchen."
3,Somewhat predictable,"I enjoyed this novel to an extent, but it was predictable at certain parts. The character development was excellent, though and it was fast - paced. And thank goodness - no neat ending in sight."
2,Promising at times with many lags in this serial killer book,"Finally, a John Saul book that I have read that is not entirely about si-fi killer children. The best part of this book is the beginning, but it drags after the first few chapters, with repetitive scenes. The best part that got my interest was that it was set in Seattle (familiar territory). I couldn't wait to finish it so that I could begin a new book that was on my shelf. This is probably the least liked John Saul book I have read to date, and I have read about 8 of his. If you are totally in to serial killer mysteries, this may be OK, but even the ending is not complete, as he leaves a potential romance between the key Policeman and the key reporter, just forgotten at the end...so, why all the lead-ons throught the novel?"
4,The Best,This is a great psychological thriller. John Saul ranks with Stephen King. People should read this book. It jumps right into the story and will scare you have to death.
3,Not one of his best.,"I love to read John Saul novels. He captures me from the very first page. The character development in this book was well done. I felt as though I knew Anne and Glen Jeffers personally. My problem with the book was that it was too predictable. I was writing the parts of the story in my head even before they happened. When I came to those parts in my reading, I was disappointed because it was nothing unexpected. This is the only book by John Saul that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. It will not, however, keep me from reading other selections he has done."
