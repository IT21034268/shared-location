5,Great Album,"In my opinion, this album is better than the first. Don't get me wrong, I listened to the first a whole lot..but I've definitely listened to this one more. People whine and complain about Jared Leto and this band..""stick to acting"" blah blah blah. There will always be people who don't like things, but that is okay..everyone has their own opinion, right? Just try to be open minded when you sample music, if you aren't..then you'll be dissappointed more often than not. I like some good bands, like Tool for instance. They're one of the best bands out there in my opinion, but I don't go listening to stuff expecting it to be like Tool..that is where I believe a lot of the bad reviews come from - close-minded people. Like the top review calls it ""Space Metal""...this is definitely ""space rock"" at its finest, I have yet to hear anything like it."
4,Well worth a listen,"30 Seconds to Mars' latest release, A Beautiful Lie is everything I like about rock. Jared Leto has an awesome voice, the songs are melodic but still have an edge, and the lyrics are powerful as well. The reviewer before me is obviously trying to be the hipster whose opinion differs from everybody else or either we aren't listening to the same album.The opener, Attack, packs a huge punch and it is no wonder why it was chosen as a single. It is an amazing song. After that there are several standouts like A Beautiful Lie, The Fantasy, The Kill, R-evolve and Battle of One. But honstly I cannot think of one song I skip, because overall every track is solid. Not every track is great, but still solid. Anyway I don't know what else I could say but give it a listen for yourself and buy it if you like it. Any rock fan should give this 1 try."
3,nothing special,"I haven't heard their debut, so I don't know if they've gotten worse or better. This album isn't anything special, the lyrics are far from original or creative, but the sound is a bit unique. This is the first taste I've gotten of this band but it just seems so familiar. Kind of like a rerun of a show you've seen long ago. I wouldn't compare them to the used, and I wouldn't say that they're completely emo BUT it does sound quite whiny in some of the songs. The first few songs are relatively enjoyable, but the album just seems to go downhill and makes me lose any interest I had in the first place."
1,It won't play,"Like so many other customers, I've found this CD will not play on my computer, even though I have a brand-new Gateway running Windows XP and the newest version of Windows Media Player.This is atrocious. This sort of copy protection needs to stop. Because I bought the CD used, I can't take it back to a store. Don't make the same mistake I did.:-(f*** copy protectionpeace"
2,Beautiful Lie (30STM),"After receiving the initial order, there was a problem with one of the tracks. I contacted Amazon customer service and was quickly told a replacement would be sent. Which was also defective. They notified me that the problem was wide spread and once I sent both back, I had no problems getting my refund. I can honestly say they have given me excellent and quick customer service. I plan to continue to shop at [...]."
1,Don't Bother!,"I should have listened to all the song samples before buying this CD! This groups style needs alot of work, between the wimpery-whinney serinading and heavy metal screaching my head hurts. I haven't been victim to listening to music this bad since my mother's only remedy for depression was blasting Niel Diamond for 3 hours every night. There should be a refund for music this terribleA Beautiful Lie!"
4,Decent,"To start it off 30 Seconds to Mars self titled album was much better then ""A Beautiful Lie"". This release is still good but it lost its edge and went a little emo sounding.Attack- 2/5- Good song but gets annoying fast, overplayedA Beautiful Lie- 4/5- One of the better songs on the CD, very goodThe Kill- 3/5- Decent song, gets old and annying fast, overplayedWas it a dream?- 2/5- Didnt really care for this song very much, its boringThe Fantasy- 3/5- Pretty good song but really didnt catch my attentionSavior- 4/5- Good song, love the instrument and lyricsFrom Yesterday-4/5- One of the better songs but gets annoyingThe story- 2/5- Good slow song but it bored me to deathR-evolve- 4/5- Love the song never gets oldA modern myth- 1/5- very boring song, same thing over and over again, def the worst on the albumBattle of one- 5/5- Got the heavy edge back def the best song on this album"
1,Boring!!!!!!!,I just saw them live in concert along with Seether and Audioslave. All I can say is they are absoutley BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Horrible!!!!!!!! Do NOT waste your money on this trash.
5,A Must,"This CD is definitely a change of pace from their debut album; however, I wouldn't consider that a bad thing. This album is more raw and real. The ""spacey effects"" are present enough to emphasize their original sound without detracting from the overall feel and lyrical messages. This CD has it all from the palpable energy in ""Attack"" to the haunting vocals in ""The Story."" If you're looking for something addictive and noteworthy, this album is a must."
3,MARS,"A pretty decent cd. Wouldn't be the first to put in to listen to out of my collection, but there are some pretty good songs on there."
2,30 Seconds to Disappointment,"Listening to the first song for a few moments, I already knew that this album was not going to be like their first. ""A Beautiful Lie"" has a few good moments, but most of it isn't as explosive or captivating as their first. There is a lot of screaming, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of feeling behind it. The songs are pretty slow-paced.What this album seems to be is a failed attempt at recreating the power and sound of the self-titled album, only adding more feelings and emotions (notice the roses all over the album art?).The CD doesn't seem to work with Windows Media Player on my computer. Also, the copy protection allows you to copy or burn the album a maximum of three times, apparantly.This album is largely boring and nothing special. I hate to say it. The bonus tracks, however, are pretty good."
4,Enjoyable,Not as good as their latest album. I enjoyed about half of this CD. Can't explain it. Some of the songs just didn't appeal to me.
3,GOOD BUT SOMETHING IS MISSING!,"This album is a kind of album that you can only wonder what's missing?Ive been a fan and supporter for the band for almost 4 years and there debut album is a classic space rhythm ride which pulsing and engaging tones were created to make it feel like spacerock.Don't get me wrong this is a good album bit non comparable to there debut>Missing is the intensity,desire,the moving lyrics,the fast paced rhythms and most noticeable the attitude.Jared Leto has a incredible voice and has talent but this band's potential is breaching mainstream stardom and you can't help the fact it's in there back of there minds and you can tell.Songs worth mentioning are HUNTER,A BEAUTIFUL LIE,ATTACK,A MODERN MYTH.A good album indeed but missing some key components and really evolving as a band means experimenting new sounds and surfaces.My Critics Choice>6/10 good but average at best."
1,Copy Protected,"This is a ""copy protected"" CD which means it is not actually a ""Compact Disc"" (look closely and you won't find the CD logo anywhere on the packaging) and does not conform to the spec. It's very likely that you will not be able to get this onto your iPod or other player. If you're like me, that makes this disc (remember, it's not a CD) useless since I don't even own a normal CD player. Don't give these guys any of your hard-earned money. Find another way to hear this music or find an artist that actually cares about their fans."
3,What happened to 30STM?,"This album is ok. It sounds to me like a much better version of Breaking Benjamin, with vocal stylings ala The Muse. Although these arent exact comparisons, they are relatively accurate. The first album blew me away! I never heard anything like it. It was simply epic. I was very doubtful they could recreate that in this album; the album in general is meh. It sounds mainstream and not very interesting. The other reviews are dead on. I still love 30 STM, but they really need to get back to the basics and hopefully come out with a 1st CD-esque third release."
3,30 seconds of the same,"30 seconds to mars is an okay band i guess. But don't you notice there songs sound alike ? Its either Jared Leto's voice or the sound. In the song ""The Kill"" the chorus "" Bury me Bury me"" sounds like the part in the song ""Attack"" when he sings "" Run away Run away"" I think the band is trying too hard with the music because they are trying to make the lyrics more emo. Jared Leto just grew his hair and put eyeliner just to fit the part of a rockstar. Another person commented that he didin't want people to take the band litterally. It sounds like the band is just a one time deal to him."
4,WHAT HAPPENED?,"Im not a kid im a grownup....this review thing isnt working.anyways i first have to say.as intensifying the first album was it absorbed a whole different meaning of spacerock.they used effects, synthesiers and straighforward lyrics to move how they wanted the album to look at.a beautiful lie doenst have the same emotions and sound and its certainly different.maybe im contentious but it seems jared leto wanted to go to a more complex path of melodic overtones.its a style thta sometimes is risky and for this record it is.you can say im disspointed but still its a good effort after three years away.'the best songs on the cd:1.the kill2.from yesterday3.attack4.the perverse but welldone remake of hunter(bjork was better)criticschoice:4/5 songs: well crafted.but some missing linkproduction: good but needed improvementlyrics: vey steadily droned and out thereoverall: not much to talk about but still good"
1,Won't Play,"This CD is copy protected, and won't play in any of my CD players, nor my DVD player. The copy protection is supposed to allow you to play it on your PC as well, however that does not work on either my XP or my Win2000 PC. I'd like to give a review of the music IF I COULD EVER LISTEN TO IT. Do not buy this CD and support this horrid attempt at limiting my free use of the music I buy."
4,Good start for Trucks,"First off don't listen to Chris from Wisconson, after all he is from Wisconsin and is most likely a PAB who listens to Whitney Houston and the Backstreet Boys. This CD shows Derek's prowess on the slide guitar and was a good introduction to his work. Derek's second release is even better though!!"
1,Boring!,"I listened to this twice & was bored to tears. Too many instrumentals that all sound the same. The good news is I won't have to listen to it again because it found its way into the circular file, a first for me."
5,Great jamming and jazzy tunes,Derek Trucks 1st CD is a little more jazzy than some later efforts. Coltrane and Miles Davis tunes are covered here along with original material. I bought this CD at a concert where Derek was the opening act for Gregg Allman. Derek played his set and guested on a few Gregg Allman songs. He wasn't yet a member of the Allman Brothers Band but was in the loop though.Sorry to see that this is out of print as it is well worth hearing and owning.
4,Go direct to Hittin the note website,"You can find all of Derek Trucks C.D.'s at the site called Hittin the Note <google it>. It's an ABB site and they have all Derek Trucksmerchandise as well as Allman Bros Band,etc.I just bought this C.D. for $15.00 from the site....bought many more for the same price, a DVD from Chgo performance at Park West <Songlines> that backs up their live C.D. Roadsongs from the same venue. Price on each off their site is $15.00. (The C.D. is a double)Support the band and buy direct from this site. I've ordered a couple times..a shirt too, which I love!!!I use Amazon for many things...but for Derek Trucks, I will go to Hittin the note."
5,This makes it so easy to have sharp pruners,"I was surprised how easy it is to sharpen garden pruners with this little tool - it took only 4 or 5 swipes along the angled edge, and one on the straight edge and they are back to sharp as new. It is small enough to fit comfortably in your hand. Great find and super value."
1,Your better off using the sidewalk,"Corona is for betty homemakers. I wouldn't sharpen a crayon with this. There are three ways to sharpen things properly. #1 a high speed grinding wheel (you better know exactly what your doing), #2 a sharpening stone, #3 any Japanese or German sharpening product.this flimsy little thing will turn your thumb into a lacerated pool of hell."
2,It works but then its shot after a season,This sharpener works fairly well but wears out very quickly. Mine is shot after 2 months and thats with using both sides.I would not recommend this product since its a throw away sharpener.
3,pretty good sharpener,It works pretty well but will get dull again fast. make sure you carry it with you to sharpen every few cuts.
3,BioTechnology for everyone,"As a matter of fact, biotechnology is to come;not today,nor tomorrow. One dayNot for Beings, but for Human Beings.Consider the work of H.R.Giger,check state of the art inrobot technology. That's the point: biology and technologymerged in one single entity.But, are we, as single indentity, on our way to accept suchchanges ?"
3,Review for Out of Control,"Kevin Kelly was the executive editor at Wired, and his own magazine had a negative review. It describes distributed computing systems and concommitant communication problems in a new light, vastly expanding the scope of otherwise mundane academic articles on the topic. Kelly defines the rules of complex system behavior that simultaneously apply to traditional distributed computing, to markets, to a flock of birds or a bee hive. This book is tedious but worth a read."
4,Excellent and Informative,"My favorite reading from my humanities class. It is one ofthose books that makes good analogies between biology andmachines, and how technology is moving towards anintegration of both into our lives. This is a book that caninterest those who know techno-talk and those who know verylittle about how our technology operates. It gave much tothink. Crystal D. Walker/Central Michigan University Sophmore"
3,A good book leads to other branches/trees. Kelly did that.,"A truly good book carries one forward. Critics (those who can't write) are carried backwards. Out of Control carried me to Hofstadter's GOEDEL,ESCHER and BACH, as well as to Manchester's A WORLD LIT ONLY BY FIRE. Society, Business and my field (healthcare) benefit from a vision of where we are going with our current vision and where we could go with an adaptive vision. A memorable work"
5,A must to learn how technology will change our lives,"A very convincing book, describing the relationship between technology and life. It certainly helped me to further expand my thoughts on the network economy. In one word: great!"
3,"Groundbreaking book, but newer titles offer more insight","This book was groundbreaking in 1994; its insights have been improved upon by more recent writing on the same subjects. If you are interested in this topic, I recommend considering Steven Johnson's EMERGENCE before you buy this book; Johnson discussions some of Kelly's ideas, but offers are more up-to-date analysis of the phenomenon of non-hierarchical/centralized models of organization. Otherwise, this book is valuable for its historical positioning--how things seemed and were seen almost a decade ago."
5,Singularity has been here,"This book is a series of magazine articles thrown together in one collection. This doesn't take away from the impact of the book, but rather enhances it. The general theme is manufactured items are becoming more nature-like and nature is being manipulated by man into one sense of a ""vivisystem."" What Ray Kurzweil discusses in his book ""Singularity is Near,"" Kelly provides examples of the merging of machine and nature. Some of the better chapters (Nine Laws of God, God Games, and Artificial Evolution) are how humankind is manipulating environments and playing God or in some cases replacing God for the better. It is a difficult read at times and requires some knowledge of science. If you are a reader of Wired Magazine, you will enjoy this book. Great thoughts are brought together into one book."
4,An enjoyable read for anyone interested in Artificial Life,"The relaxed style of this book makes it very enjoyable light reading. And yet the author covers a wide range of issues in a captivating way that shows his enthusiasm for and experience within the ALife and related fields. For anyone new to the field, I'd recommend this as essential introductory material. I've been involved for (just) a couple of years now but am sure that I'd have benefited from reading this at the beginning. It's cheap - buy a copy and put it by a comfy chair."
4,think locally/act locally,"A fun romp through the fringe-world of contemporary science/intellectual fads.Kelly serves up a rich cocktail of darwinism, ecology, and decentralism --- how local decisions, based on local data (decisions made by particles, molecules, cellular automata, rabbits and lynxes, consumers and producers, or internet routers) add up to a global system that is (maybe) optimal, or at least mostly works and is at least resiliant in the face of change."
5,Cute and a good buy,"I bought this as a gift for a friend's little girl. She has had it approx. 6 months now and when I visit, the child says now many of the spanish phrases. Very cute. It supplements some of the spanish bits she is picking up from Dora the Explorer series. Last I've heard, there have been no problems with the functioning of the toy. The only drawback I noticed is that the stitching on the clothes appears as if it might pull out easily, but that is quite minor, particularly considering the decent price overall. I am getting another soon for a different friend."
1,"3 strikes, they're out.","returned the first 2 that malfunctioned, only to get a third one that also malfuctions.Piece of junk. Save your money!"
2,like tepid water....,"The impulsive governess left me extemely disatisfied. In fact, I lost my enthusiasm as early as the few few pages when I discoverd that the author was fond of head hopping. Furthermore, the predictable plot, and characters that were much too tame(or just underdeveloped), made it impossible for me to enjoy this book. Lord Forestale especially, acted more like a green 19 year old than the grown man he was meant to be, and absolutly nothing like a man sharp enough to be entrusted with couriering important documents for the country at wartime.Sorry to say, i will be giving Barbara Allister's books a miss in the future.Oh, and also, the blurb on the back cover of the book is totally misleading. Deveraux could in no way be refered to as a man with ""an iron will and molten temper""!"
3,Disappointed in Nostradamus.,I bought this book as an impulse. The cover intrigued me and the discription of the book on the back intrigued me even more. Unfortunately I feel that to book didn't have follow through.I found all four voices in this book to be too similar. There was no tangable differences between Cheryl and Jason especially. I also found Reg and and Heather's sections to be extremely forced.This book is timely and I think it had GREAT potential. However I feel it falls flat. The characters are trite and extremely naive to the world.I am giving it three stars.
3,Less satisfied than I hoped to be,"I'm a Coupland fan, off and on, and found this book easy and fun to read; it had less of an impact on me than others of his have had, and the semi-obligatory spiritual ruminations were no more interesting than others in the same genre, but it was fine overall. It was a library pick for me, and I don't need to own a copy.I agree with previous reviewers that the first two narrators were far more powerful than the last two; I'd add that the book was more interesting before Heather comes along. There are two plots in the Heather section - one engaging (if obvious), the other clumsy, better suited to writers of crime & suspense fiction."
3,Not sure what is up here--but it is Coupland after all.,"Well, Hmm...I just finished this novel and I'm not sure what I thought. I didn't like a lot, but I certainly didn't dislike it. This was nowhere near as bad as Shampoo Planet (which Coupland himself admits was not a winner). However, the spiritual elements that worked so well in Girlfriend in Coma (which this reminded of at times) and Life After God (I book I loved) are the main focus here, but they don't always work. The story is interesting and the format highly couplandesque. I admired the characters' ability to try and understand and change, but something was missing for me. Perhaps I did not connect to these people (also something of an issue in his last novel, All Families...but that at least was one big lark). Anyway, lots of people have loved this book. I still love Coupland after having read 6 of books, I'll be in line for the next."
3,He can do better,"I am a big fan of Douglas Coupland, but I found Hey Nostradamus! rather disappointing. It definitely had its moments, but for the most part was aimless and pointless, and seemed like he was just trying to meet a deadline and hurry and get the book finished. He did finish it, but with no apparent ending. If you haven't read any of his books, I would highly recommend NOT starting with this one. Try Generation X, Girlfriend in a Coma or Microserfs instead. Maybe his next effort will be better."
2,wrestling with spirituality,"Just finished the book. I've read everything he's ever written. The last few have seemed to struggle..He's such an effective story teller. I love the situations he creates, but he always falls apart somewhere around the end. I was riveted to this book. Hooked from page one. By the end of the third section I was angry, cause I knew he'd drop off again...On the inside cover of the book it describes this as people 'Wrestling with their spirituality'. He should figure out his spirituality before it ruins his career as a writer. Too much on the God thing. If your a Coupland fan, you may want to reconsider rushing out and buying this, simply because it has his name on it. Hey Doug! Relax!...Get confession out of the way, and come on back to the group!"
4,What a great look at our society and violence and faith,I wish this book was longer. It stayed with me long after I finished it. Coupland has such great insight into the nature of violence and faith. Beautifully crafted into four stories around a central theme. I found myself re-reading sections so I could absorb it's content better. WONDERFUL!
3,Woops,"I was really surprised at how disappointed I was with this book after seeing all of the positive feedback it had gotten. The book started off great, and about the last 40 pages just kind of bored me. I suggest reading the first two chapters and skipping the rest."
3,"I'd Give It 3.5 Stars, But That Wasn't An Option!","I'm not a Coupland fan, but I found this book to be a very moving and thought-provoking read. Recommended."
5,a great read,I read this book with no expectations. What a pleasant surprise it was. It is very stylized and descriptive. The author uses metaphors and humorous observations to express God's most important (and forgotten) messages. It is rare to read a book these days with characters that are more unique than what I see in any summer blockbuster movie. Caring for the dead makes the effort to be better than that--and it succeeds.
4,books wow getting expensive,"Shipped fast and the best deal I found on this book Could buy from this seller again.Best price I found by far on this book, shipping reasonable.This was a present. I had read this book before. It is a big book. It is not a starry-eyed account of a woman who joins the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It is good, honest and riveting account.No one who had this book listed under $30 actually had this book, not quite shure what that is about.I see the day soon where I won't be buying books anywhere except from rummage sales.There may be great reasons for the price jumps, but I haven't had a raise in over 7 years, and have taken pay cuts to keep empployed at all. So$[...] for a new paperback and $[...] for hard back really high."
2,Not what I expected,"It's not just that I love Orson Scott Card's science fiction beyond all other authors. It's not even that I have a minimal opinion about the Mormon faith. I just couldn't get into this book. I meandered along during the first half, mildly interested in the characters. However, when they turned to the Mormon faith, the book lost me from there. How could a family who had been through so much be taken in so readily and easily? As I skimmed the last parts, I discovered I didn't miss much. The heroine is coarse--I never could love her, feel sorry for her, or identify with her. I couldn't even dislike her. The male characters are clumsy and dull, the storyline is rather boring. Even the love affair between the Prophet and the heroine lacks depth. I couldn't really believe such an uptight, ""strong"", silent woman would fall for his ""visions"" and ""voices"" from God (in other words, his lies). Overall, I wish I hadn't wasted the evening and had re-read ""Enchantment"" instead."
1,Horrible! Not an uplifting book!,"I found Saints to be a poor sampling of LDS fiction. The first half of the book tells the story how Dinah Kirkman grew up in England and is VERY depressing. I continued to read the book with the hope that it would get better. It didn't! The story continues with Dinah's polygamous marriage to Joseph Smith then latter to Brigham Young. The story takes a very harsh view of Emma Smith. The intimate relationships were too graphically described. This book, though maybe well written, is not historically accurate and has blatant historical flaws. It is a depressing book, with no redeeming factors. Don't waste your time on it!"
2,I did not feel proud of my heritage after reading this one!,I thought I was reading a Harlequin romance novel based on Mormon polygamy love affairs. I do not beleive OSC gave Joseph Smith the respect that a prophet deserves. The book left a bad taste in my mouth.
4,Captivating,"I very much enjoyed Saints. While I do not agree on a philosophical level with all the teachings of the Morman church, I found myself spellbound with OSC's telling of his ancestors. I felt the ending wrapped up too quickly, but the telling of the saga is magnificant. A must read for history buffs, and especially religious history buffs."
5,Wonderful...it just absorbs you,"I really enjoyed this book. I am a Mormon and I found it to be a curious ""fiction"" of our early leaders. Card takes liberty with dialouge and thoughts, but is mostly true to character. Dinah is a complilation of several women ,one of them being Eliza R Snow. This book gives an unexpected (but none-the-less deserved) positive view on pologamy. This is understandably not written for the non-Mormon audience."
3,Worth used book price,I'm not a huge fan of Orson Scott Card but 'Saints' is one of his better books. Call it a Mormon combination of L'Amour's 'Ride the River'(written from the prospective of a strong female) & Brown's 'DaVinci Code'(fictionalized history with a dash of conspracy theory). Will make you apprecieate the sacrifices of the early Mormons. I doubt it'll rock your world or have you racing to the nearest Mormon house of worship but you could do a lot worse.
3,Reading Saints,"This is a topic that is already challenging enough for some of us who are descended from the early Mormon polygamists. As I continually grapple with my own understanding of this practice, I felt I was at a great disadvantage reading historical fiction--not knowing completely the fact from the fiction. I guess I had better make a trip to the archives myself!All I can say is that I hope my great-great whatever was kinder, more humble, and more lovable than any of the characters portrayed in this epic!"
2,Ready to Convert,"It wasn't my favorite Orson Scott Card novel but after reading this fanciful, glossed-over version about the origins of one of Christianity's most successful, bizarre and ridiculous cults, I was almost convinced that polygamy was godly and that Native Americans were lost Israelis.Better works by Card: Wyrms, Worthing Saga, Pastwatch...He still earns stars because the man can narrate a story..."
3,wax,"I would not recommend this product. I'm not sure if the problem is the wax or the heating system but it's difficult to evenly spread out the wax and it takes a lot of time. It works but it ends up becoming extremely messy, time consuming, and not nearly as effective as having it done professionally."
4,Good value cooker.. but steamer basket has issues,"I bought this as it was heavily discounted on Amazon(~25$ including shipping). The brushed steel exterior looks extremely elegant. It is quite large and cooks rice for two in about 10 minutes.My only complaint with this unit is that when the steamer basket is inserted, it gets on to 'warm' mode before the rice is done. I just avoid using the basket now."
2,Not worth buying,I had this for over a year. The nonstick wore off easily over time and one day it just stopped working. Not happy with this product.
3,Not bad ..but the best too,"I bought this cooker and we use this cooker twice per day for cooking rice. Only issue with this cooker is, bottom of rice would be over cooked and becomes black. We should disconnect after the it gets into warm mode.Overall, it is not a bad cooker for rice.ThanksRama"
1,Lousy rice cooker,Water never fails to boil and overflow out of cooker when cooking rice. Makes a mess on the countertop. Rice gets burnt at the bottom. Don't buy this!
1,This rice cooker has a fatal design flaw,"Got the rice cooker because of the good price from Amazon. However, I would strongly recommend to avoid this rice cooker because there is a fatal design flaw-it has the warmer function on all the time even not cooking. The only way to turn off the warmer fuction is to unplug the power code, which is potentially dangerous if you forget to unplug the power code. I think the engineer who designed the rice cooker should be fired! The Amazon description on the item does not correctly reveal this problem."
5,I Love This CD,"I'm really impressed with the vocals and production, and I love the pics in the CD booklet. The range of songs is cool, and I think the music offers something for everyone.All of which makes the review below very bizarre. It doesn't have much to do with music, it's just a personal attack. Clearly this was written by someone with a grudge, NOT an interest in music."
5,"Sturdy, bright, inviting and engaging",The photos are very real and keep the attention of the toddlers. The book is not wordy and has a nice rhythm to it. Great for visual learners as well as a pre-school class circle time.
3,Just ok,This visor seems a little flimsy. The brim seems overly big and I think it is unfortunate that the whole inside is lined with a white material. The fit is a little loose. I probably would have returned it if it had been more than 11.99.
4,moderately comfortable.,looks good but the fit on my head is only moderately comfortable. The padding is better in other visors I have bought.
5,So Soft,"I love this product. First my Mom, now me, and now my girls. I have even given away to friends."
5,great product,I have been using this product for over 20 years and would not do without it. Glad to see it still on the internet as I cannot find it in the stores anymore.
5,Fabulous Skin!,"A wonderful product! I love this stuff! I just ordered some more because my husband keeps using mine. It is truly wonderful. Aloe - nourishing, healthy, gentle, fabulous! That's it... the plain and simple truth!"
5,Love it!!,"I this product on my feet in the winter time. Aloe Vera products (lotions, creams . . .ect), works wonder."
3,JUST OKAY,"Although I have been using this cream on my face, I wish it had a delightful fragrance. It actually has no smell which may be good for some people but I like fragrance. It is thicker than a lotion but does absorb well."
2,It makes no difference.,I did not notice any positive results by using this cream.It did not have any bad side effects either. So you may not need it.
3,Disappointed because of the parabens.,"First, I want to say this cream does make skin feel very soft, supple and emollient... BUT after reading the ingredients, towards the end of the list, it contains parabens :(I am pregnant and it is something that should be avoided.I won't return it, for $7 it's not worth the trouble.Here's a list of the ingredients:Aloe Vera extractAqua(water)Mineral oilGlyceryl StearateCetyl AlcoholStearic AcidPropylene GlycolStearyl AlcoholCollagenElastinTocopherol Acetate (Vitamin E)SqualaneTriticum Vulgare (Wheat)Germ OilHelianthus Annuus (Sunflower)Seed oilSesamum Indicum (Sesame) Seed oilRetinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A)DimethiconeCocos Nucifera (Coconut) oilCarbomerTriethanolaminePropylene Glycol & Diazolidinyl Urea & Methylparaben & PropylparabenParfum (Fragrance)"
5,Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera Cream,"I have been using this cream for many years...it is an excellent face cream. There are two brands of this cream, vitamin E and the aloe vera. The aloe vera it is especially good if you are allergic to vitamin e. I highly recommend this face cream for anyone!"
2,Put these cowboys out to pasture,"I read great things about this book in the NY Times review, and was really disappointed. The story was flat and repetitious, the writing amateurish, the charaters one-dimensional. Bummer."
5,Good songs - not so great album,I have liked a lot of songs by this group. The best is Walk On Fire.
4,"But, Dad! It's Smokey!","This CD was released in the very earliest days of the CD era. It features 13 hits by Smokey Robinson & the Miracles and 5 of Smokey's solo hits. There are some rather glaring ommisions here, the biggest one being ""Ooo Baby Baby"". I don't understand how that one got left off. Also, the sound quality is not all that great. Save your money and buy a more recent Miracles compilation."
4,White Wolf,Interesting. It gives you a broader view of how Indians view healing and how they align the causes of sickness to how one live his/her life. It has humour and contains some emotional areas. A good read.Bought from Amazon
1,This is not THE A-Team,"Sorry, but this movie is just a bunch of wannabees. The real A-Team was from the 80's. I can't stand to watch wannabees. I can't only watch the real deal and these guys aren't it."
1,A Team,"I bought this for my friends birthday. When we watched it- it started getting stuck and scrambling all over the place- right at the exciting ending. We tried taking it out- inspecting the back of the disc, and wiping it- but that did absolutely nothing. Complete waste of money..."
1,How did the A Team get started?,"i really think they were trying to tell a story of BEFORE the hit TV show, only they bombed.if you are thinking of bying this movie because you loved the TV show of the 80s then stay away. rent it, watch it on On Demand, download it (ooops, that isn't always legal). Watch it when you have gone through your library of movies and need something to watch and you are bored."
1,"It should be called ""The D Team""","- There's a lot of action and explosions but they're not exciting.- There's no suspense or surprise either. It's just like any old action movies I've seen before. For example, there's a scene where a guy shooting from a tank dropped from a plane. I've seen it before but I don't remember in which movie.- The acting is wooden.In short, there's nothing worth watching here. It should be called ""The D Team""."
1,Genuinely Mind Numbing Movie,"Basically no plot. The action shots are incredible, but it still was a complete bore. Jessica Beil maybe gorgeous but lacks any and all ability to act and does NOT fit into the role of a ""tough"" military type, it truly was painful to watch. I expected so much more... DISAPPOINTED. My opinion: Skip It"
5,what's not to love,awesome from beginning to end. Does not need the heavy thinking that some movies try to come up with along the same line. Pure action and fun. Nice to see each actor explore the goofy side of their craft. You go in with little expectation and surprisingly walk away satisfied. Would recommend
4,Enjoyable action movie!,"Purchase came quickly through Amazon, and I enjoyed watching it. Love hearing the explosions and sound effects through my 5.1 speaker set up."
4,A must buy!!!,"Great story filled with abit over the top action scene with amazing video & audio quality. If you like action movie, this is a must buy collection. Cheers."
4,Pretty solid remake,"It's more believable than any of the original A-Team episodes but still entertaining. The plot was mostly believable, the characters were enjoyable but the ending was too over the top.I'll watch it whenever its on a movie channel, solid entertainment"
4,Very FUN movie,This was a very FUN movie. It had great action with really great stunts and the whole thing was peppered with humor that was very effective. The characters were quirky and likeable (except for that female captain!) and I enjoyed it MUCH more than I thought I would. It had enough story to keep it interesting between things blowing up and going boom. :)I never saw the old t-v series and I wasn't at all lost.
5,Overkill is so under rated! This is one fun movie! :),If ever I was wrong about a movie (So much for first impressions) it's The A team. Tops my list of surprise hits of the year. This was one fun movie to watch whether you remember the TV show or not. The casting was spot on. Liam Neeson made a perfect Hannibal Smith as were the other members of the team. It was nice to notice members of the TV show's production team were involved in the making of the movie. Here's hoping there will be a sequel!
4,THE A- TEAM,"I SAW THIS AT THE MOVIES AND I ENJOYED THE MOVIE AND DECIDED TO PURSHASE THIS BRAND NEW FROM ANOTHER SITE THRU AMAZON. IT WAS CHEAPER THERE AND IT WAS NEW. TO ME IT WAS A FAST PACED AND A FUN MOVIE. IF YOU LIKE EXPLODING THINGS , SHOOTINGS, HUMOR, AND THE PRETTY GIRL...I THINK YOU WILL ENJOY THIS."
2,Plot? Where?,"My wife & I watched this last night and just laughed at how bad the lines and plot were. There are some nice action sequences but some of the scenes are just TOO fake to be believable. It's maybe worth a rent, but I regret purchasing it b/c I know we will never want to watch it again. If you are okay with bad lines and totally impossible action sequences, then you might like this one. My wife would be mad that I actually gave this 2 stars instead of 1."
4,four stars,"Well I was really surprised,thought the movie was good.Not a Oscar contender,but it was a fun movie to watch.I like action movies and this one is just that."
3,Fun movie,This was fun - I wouldn't say it brought back memories of my childhood watching the series but perhaps that's a good thing. The BA Baracus character was a bit distracting - I just kept on thinking he wasn't the 'real' BA. Other than that there was some fun creative plot twists.
5,really enjoyable surprise,"I had this movie on my Amazon wishlist for Christmas and was happy when I opened it Christmas day. I was on the fence about how much I would like this movie since I loved watching the TV show as a kid, but I really like a lot of the actors in it...so I thought it would be worth a watch. My husband and I were both very surprised because it is actually a really good movie. We laughed a lot and I enjoyed the laid back action packed story line. If you just want to watch a fun action movie then this is a good choice!"
4,Really good movie,The movie was great. Crazy dude was worse in the movie than in the tv series. Otherwise the movie was really good.
5,Grade A Film,This was a great adaptation and made the story very current. The acting is over the top but that is the whole point. If you want a hilarious action movie that is just a ton of fun to watch then you must see this film!
3,Just OK,This was a preview and i was disappointed because it wasn't what i thought it would be. It wasn't as much like the original series as i thought it would be. maybe because it was just a preview.
2,Just Okay,This movie was absolutely boring. Nothing special and the acting was pretty awful. Even Bradley Cooper couldn't save it. It was just another action-packed movie but certainly nothing to write home about. TV series adaptations are usually not that great and this movie is no exception. The story lines were boring and the jokes not that funny.
1,false advertisement,"the way you advertise is false. its not a movie, its a documentary!! its not a movie, why call it a world premiere instead of a documentary??do not order"
5,funny movie,My whole family loved this movie! Enough said! Some where I missed the extended scenes from the original. It is still an excellent movie.
4,Love the 80's,If you grew up in the 80's you already know about the A-Team. This movie does the original A-team justice.
1,A for Absolutely boring!,Save your money folks. This ones a real sleeper. Nothing in this flickmakes any sense whatsoever. The cast is boring. The plot is boring.Everything about this new a- team is all wrong. I saw this one at thetheater and the only good thing i can say is that i didn't die watchingit. It even made the popcorn taste bad! I hope that they are not planninganother one. Some things should simply be left alone!
4,Great Action Movie Any Fan Will Like.,"Great Action, Any Easy 4 starts almost 5. I when into this thinking it would be very cheezzy, but not so much.Good acting, good plot, just an over all action packed, american movie."
5,Awesome,This movie is awesome. Grew up watching the TV show as a kid and it brought back so many memories.
4,The tv show was much better,"If I were to watch the first season of the tv show before watching this movie I probably would've lowered my rating even more. The problem is the tv show was just too good and this movie gets downgraded based on the comparison.If you've never watched the tv show then you'll probably like the movie. If you did watch the tv show, keep those memories and don't ruin it by watching this movie."
4,The A-team,"The original A-team is best, but this movie was quite good, just not as good as watching the original guys do there thing. We liked the movie and thought it was quite good. Not a great movie, but a very good movie. Plenty of action, lots of stuff getting blown up. Some of the new characters suffered in their roles as they are not anywhere as good as the original A-team series actors."
2,This is the B-Team,"As an action movie this was entertaining, but the only similarity it had to what made the orginal A-Team great was the fact that there are 3 white guys and 1 black guy. I grew up watching the A-Team and if you compare this movie to one of their episodes ""THIS MOVIE IS LAME!!!"""
2,"Good Movie, bad recording","The movie was 'new' and packaged, and the movie itself was good and quite funny. However, there are SEVERAL spots where the movie hangs up and blurs and then continues to play after a minute or so. If I purchased this at a store I would have quickly taken it back to exchange it..."
5,Alpha Mike Foxtrot - Awesome flick!,"Now you will have to watch the movie to find out what Alpha Mike Foxtrot is all about...but I can tell you that it is a fantastic action packed movie from the beginning to the end.Do not go to the theater expecting a re-make of the TV show...instead go there with an open mind and with the intent of being entertained with some comedic action.The cast, in my opinion, is dead on and makes every character portray the original cast from the TV show. There are some great catch phrases in the movie that make it fun. There is a lot of CGI in the movie but it is done quite well and makes the action sequences feel as if they were pretty darned close to real.I am not going to tell the story here..but spend the money to watch the movie and you will walk out liking/enjoying it."
3,Z - Team,"When I watch a popular movie which disappoints, I tend to check its box office report just to see if other people liked it. It does not influence my opinion but perhaps makes me realise how unique my sensibilities are.In this case I did not even bother to do that. This movie proves that sometimes it is best not to re-invent a hit TV series. Some stories are best suited for a particular format and this one is perhaps best left to the small screen. The reason why I am writing this review is the girl who plays Sosa in the movie. It is to warn you that coming within 50 metres of any of her movies can put the filmophile in you at grave risk of extinction. If there were any awards for acting-dud, she would get all 5 nominations. She is such a histrionic-wimp that she would express and talk exactly the same way if she were playing a housewife, secretary, lover, anything. Predictably stupid and with a weird name, Sosa. So""sa-d""."
2,A team review,"This was a decent new version of the A-team if you consider the actors in it. However, the plot was kind of strange and sometimes hard to follow who is evil villain and who is not...This could have been a pilot of a new A-team series presenting the new A-team members.However, as a standalone movie, it was not so good."
3,just okay...,"As a stand alone movie, it's great. You will not find in this movie what you enjoyed most from the series."
4,The A- team,Go Liam go!Haha! Really funny actin movie with Liam Neeson. This movie is really going to be a clasic you will wana see several times. I recomend to everyone! :)
5,"The A-Team, DVD","If you loved the TV show you'll like this. Stunts were great; the actor who plays ""Murdock,"" Sharlto Copely, is better than the original."
5,My surprise of the year.,"I rarely review movies. But after watching this with low expectations I had a ball. Like he says as long as you Ignore the laws of physics. Etc.But there's action from beginning to end and enough suspense to keep you Inbetween scenes.It's a perfect conbination, I doubt they will realize In a sequil UNLESS a darn good writer comes along with a good script like this was.For what this movie was, and being the very best It could be at it I give It 5 stars. AND I give special nods to all the actors as well except Mr T replacement couldn't act at all.Liam Neeson always great.Great fun boys and girls."
1,dont watch,hate amazon for tricking you this is not the movie why would you want to watch clips of the making...etc
3,A-Team Movie,the movie was ok...i kinda thought it would be better than it was but it's an ok movie to add to your collection.
3,Choppy but entertaining,"I loved the original A-team, so I was very excited about watching this movie. The A-team is very action packed right out of the gate and keeps it pretty much the entire way. Bradley Cooper is fantastic as Face, and Liam Neeson makes a great Hannibal Smith. However the movie led me to wonder what the heck was going on right out of the gate. They tried to cram a lot of back story in at the beginning. I'm guessing they expect us all to know the characters so the need for character development wasn't necessary. If you have never seen the original A-Team, you will absolutely be lost. But for those of us who are fans of the original, it's not difficult to get back on track if the storyline becomes confusing.I gave it a 3 because of the confusion of the movie, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy watching it. The A-Team was a very entertaining movie, and will be to you also if you like car chases, helicopter craziness, and explosions."
1,how to watch,how do i watch the movie and not a 6 minute trailer I thought i could download the entire movie with amazon prime if not then i have been robbed!!!!!
4,The A-Team,"I really do like this movie, hope they make a sequel and wished the original stars made a cameo. Fun!"
1,Not the movie,"This is not the A-Team movie, just an ad for the movie and some premier footage. Dont waste your money, or even your time. BLAH!"
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I loved this movie. when I first saw it, I did not know I was watching extended cut. I watched it as many times as I could on the cable station that was playing it. Well, they stopped playing it. So another cable station started to air it. UGH! it was the regular version, there was so much missing out of the movie. I hate it when they do this to a movie. SHOW THE ENTIRE MOVIE PLEASE. LOVED THE A TEAM. I hope there will be more movies with The A Team.Dianne, Warren, MI"
4,Entertaining!!,"I enjoyed the movie, it was entertaining. Funny and action-packed. I would recommend it to others, definitely worth a watch."
1,TV shows make lousy movies,"The A-Team was one of my favorite TV shows. The movie, IMO, is a total disaster. The story is silly, the acting awful and the production horrible. The only reason I finished watching it was to write this review and not base it on half the movie. The TV show was fun and even charming. The movie is tiresome and outrageous. I expect to get some nasty replies to my review. I invite you to say whatever you want. However, the movie stunk."
1,No rental?,"Who these days does not provide an option for an online rental or download? Come on, MPAA. If you want to stop piracy and make your buck for your videos, listen to what the internet masses are saying: give me online instant-watch or download capabilities, and I'll be happy to pay.BOOOOOO..."
1,"Love this movie, but disc I got sent is a RENTAL COPY","THIS REVIEW IS FOR A USED COPY OF THE ABOVE - **DISSAPPOINTING** Love this movie, and I bought the above as I was interested in the extras. Got it in the mail yesterday, and IT""S A RENTAL COPY WITH NO EXTRAS AT ALL (which was the whole point of buying it). If I didnt care about the extras, I would have bought it used at my local Blockbuster closing down sale for $5 total! Thats what I get for trying to get a cheap deal I suppose."
3,Fun!,Sometimes you just want a movie that is fun and packed with action. No redeeming value. A-Team meets those qualifications.
3,No digital copy,"Awesome movie, awesome cast, awesome Blu Ray quality. Sucky penny pinching vendor who used digital copy for himself. So its a two-pack instead of two, which means it is not forever burnt into my apple TV. You kinda need to disclose these things."
4,A-Team Blu-Ray/DVD pack,"Excellent seller, quick delivery and item received without any damages. Only concern is that the serial number for the digital copy of the movie seems to have been deactivated; other than that the item is/was in excellent condition"
2,You're not missing much...,"You're not missing much if you skip this movie. There is a minimal plot in this movie of double or triple cross among the villains and the A-Team got dragged into it. The rest of the movie is filled with big explosions, gun fights and aerial hijinks. Each team member gets a bit of character development, but blink and you might miss it."
3,"Bad Disk, worked after cleaning",I ordered this DVD a while back and finally watched it. at first it wouldn't load then 1/2 way thru it went to boxes and locked up. It took a while to get it out of my player and I started another DVD which played thru w/o problems. I waited too long to get a refund and it would cost more to ship it back for a reduced refund so I'm stuck with it. My problem. Note to self: run the DVDs ASAP to see if they work as advertised. I'll clean it and try again. Hopefully it will work this time. Buying a used disk is always chancey. Cleaned it and it played thru.
4,8 MGB Memory Card Needed,"An 8 MGB Memory Card will be needed to play this DVD on most Blu-ray players. While the cost of this card can be more than the purchase price of the DVD, the card can be used repeatedly with other Blu-ray DVDs requiring additional memory.The Blu-ray is excellent and surpasses the original theater version."
1,Inaccurate Product Description,"When I ordered this product, I was very excited to receive it! I love The A-Team and it would have been great to get to own it and for such a great price. However, when I received the product, I discovered it was for a different region and would not play on my DVD player. Maybe it said it in the product description and I just missed it, but I certainly don't remember it mentioning it anywhere. Very dissatisfied- now it just sits on my shelf."
2,Not what I expected,"This was only a trailer, I expected it to be the movie. It was not even an extended trailer, just the standard theatre trailer."
3,"""A"" Team Movie","The televison show was easy to follow. One basic plot. Very few twists. And the good guys would win in the end. The movie was too complicated to follow. If there is a second movie, I hope that it is simpler and has the humor of the televison series."
2,"Has potiential, but not as good as the original t.v. show of the same name","This movie has potiential, but its not as good as the original t.v. show of the same name. The main cast is poorly portrayed and Mr. YT doesn't star as Bosco,the comedy is very few, the action scenes are choppy because of bad camera shifting and the acting is bad. Despite these issues, the action is cool, but not really worth checking out. Watch the original t.v.. show if u wanna see the real A-Team, not this boring waste of time. 5/10"
3,"As good as Indiana 4, good actors","So, this movie suffers the same problem as Indiana Jones 4 did... when it was over the top, it was WAY TOO FAR over the top. But, given that *understanding*, this is a very fun movie. Liam Neeson and Bradley Cooper are great in the film and you will have some out-loud laugh moments. (Actually: 3.5 stars)"
4,A-Team Theater Review,"I have not seen the originals, but the new movie is excellent. I had a basic knowledge of the characters and the plot of the older movies, and I thought it was excellent. The over-the-top action scenes really hit hard, Sharlton Copley really shines as Captain Murdock, and Leeam Neeson delivers as Hannibal Smith. A great action film if you're looking for not-too-serious over-the-top nonstop action and humor."
1,Don't even bother.,"This is such a predictable and boring movie that not even my husband, which was very much into the A-team, wanted to finish watching.Don't loose your time."
2,Too fake to be good.,"I didn't even make it to the end of this flick. Glad I rented it on sale for .99 cents. There were some funny scenes, but movies like this which are filled with impossible CGI acrobatics and stunts don't appeal to me in the least. I don't know why Hollywood keeps pumping out movies like that, because in my opinion, it completely detracts from the overall film."
4,Truly Gifted!!!!,"Vanessa Bell Armstrong is a STRONG Gospel singer and this is one of her best CDs yet! I especially like that this CD is from a concert. She explains the meaning of songs and where they came from. She takes you step by step through the song, ""Peace Be Still,"" which is one of my favorites. She does a great job in getting her message across."
1,Awful!,"I can't believe it! How could anybody so untalented have a record contract? I am outraged that a group as pitiful as this would be permitted to sing some of the greatest jazz standards of all time. It's a complete butchery that, to anyone new to jazz, only gives it a bad name. Kenny G and Chuck Mangeione have been long-time members of this list, and now Vox One can be added as well."
5,Marvelous and inventive,"This recording by Vox One is simply marvelous. I love the syncopated rhythms and unusual chord sequences. The singing is tight and precise, and only the first and last tracks use vocal effects to supplement the singing. ""Over the Rainbow"" is my favorite recording, a wonderful a cappella twist on the old standard. If you love a cappella music you'll love this album."
5,The best of the best,"Vox One was clearly one of the greats and this, their best album, is comparable only to Real Group'sUnreal!for technical perfection, great arranging, style, panache, and probably ahead in jazz ""feel"" -- Gary Burton was a huge fan, and he knows a few things about it. Based on ""a customer's"" comment, we obviously need more vocal jazz fans here. People need to distinguish between personal taste and more objective criteria (for the record, I don't ""like"" Kenny G. either)."
3,I enjoyed watching this show despite the bad tape quality.,"The original Incredible Hulk TV movie was way ahead of it's time. The characters are believable, the acting is good, and the writing is great. This movie avoided the traps that most comic book adaptions fall into where they are trying to impress us with special effects and over the top villains. To this day no comic book adaption has matched the sincerity nor the intelligence displayed in ""The Incredible Hulk"". The only negative comment that I would like to pass on is in regards to the tape quality. The movie is 22 years old and it shows {painfully in certain parts}. Hopefully Universal will have these remastered and soon. The low quality however still isn't enough to spoil your viewing pleasure."
5,"Superior specs, Superior design, get this but get the 12 foot cord model if you need the length","On July 7 2007 I received from Amazon the Monster Cable MP AV600 Power Protector and the Belkin SurgeMaster Superior Series 8-Outlet Surge Protector (6', 1770 Joules). They both sold for about the same price. The Monster is vastly inferior. The Belkin has three times the Joules rating. The Belkin is much more attractive and well designed. The Monster is just a squarish standard strip that felt very cheap compared to the Belkin and worst of all the Monster had a bad rubber stink and the cord felt gritty. The Belkin had a smooth white power cord. My other mistake was to get the Belkin with the 6 foot cord , I realized a 12 foot cord was available after ordering. You will be MUCH happier with the Belkin. I will post this exact review with the Monster at 1 star as well. Last time I gave something 1 star Amazon did not display it. Maybe the higher end Monster models are nicer."
1,This surgeprotector could have caused a fire,"This exact surge protector almost caused a fire. It did save my computer after a power surge outside, but it fried the unit and created burn marks on my hardwood floor. I was home when it happened. It made a loud zapping noise and the entire upstairs smelled like an electrical fire. I would never buy this product. My electrician asked me how much I paid for the surge protector...he said it looked so cheap, so we are looking into getting a whole house surge protector for about $90.00 for the part and about 2 hours of labor....worth it. I will never go cheapo on a surge protector again."
5,Excellent value,"This surge protector is an excellent value with 8 outlets. A sliding protecting mechanism deters unsuspecting children from putting themselves in a dangerous situation.A line splitter for the telephone jack is integrated into this system.I trust this system to protect my television and peripherals attached to it (bedroom and den).Overall, for the price, this is a great value."
1,First class folk singer/song writer as evidenced here!,"Leigh Hilger has grown int a first class singer/songwirter. On this album Leigh has done some amazing compositions in the Americana/Folk music arena. Casting Shadows trancends the folk genre and takes you an area of music few others do. I compare her music to other great women such as Bonnie Rait, Nancy Griffith, Marcia Ball, Christine Kane etc. You will love this album regardless of your music preference. It has it all!"
4,Very nice!,This product is great! It feels nice and is very relaxing. My only complaint is that the scent is slightly too strong for my 8-month old. I'm thinking we'll wait to use it when he turns a year old.
3,Basic Phrasel Verbs,The book gives good information to English language learners about the idiomatic use of phrasel verbs. The context is clear to be understood by any student. A helpful book for me and my students.
5,Great Book for Pony Lovers!,"In this book we meet a little girl named Lucinda, who lives with her grandmother because her mother died when she was four,and her father is away studying animals in the Amazon jungle of Brazil. Lucinda meets Anna, a girl who lives next door, and Anna's friend Pam, and together they form the Pony Pals.In this first book of the series the girls try to save a pony named Snow White, who was caught in a barbed wire fence, and is hurt. With the help of her Pony Pals, Lucinda sets out to save the pony and find it a home. She gets a big surprise when she meets the pony's real owner, and the story gets more exciting from there.I like this book because I love ponies. If you love ponies and you like adventure then you should read this book too.Enjoy!"
5,Read THIS,I loved this book its a graet interdoction to the pony pals and it is not only inthasting but you lren from it to.
5,Liam Neeson was great as usual!,"I just watched this movie on televison and it was great,and as usual liam neeson delivers a great acting job, not to mention the characters he and andy mcdowel play had great chemistry together. Again liam does a good job as he did in several other movies such as ""the phantom menace""..GOOD JOB LIAM!"
2,received wrong movie,I received Deceived with Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGreggor. I am sure this movie is equally exciting. Usually I get the movie I order. This is the first mix up for me.
1,Boring film,"I watched this thinking ""Liam Neeson & Viggo Mortensen, this has to be good."" Unfortunately, they are not onscreen enough. Instead, it's an Andie McDowell movie - she is NOT an actor. She is so boring that I turned it off after 15 minutes of excruciating torture.Don't waste your money."
2,This is NOT Ruby Cairo,"This is the edited edition of Ruby Cairo, which was released in the U.S. Andy McDowell objected to the nudity in the original. ""Deceptions"" is the edited version. Ruby Cairo is only available overseas.I give it 2 stars because it is not the original."
1,dont waste your money,"I bought this movie looking at the unbelievable cast Mortensen, McDowell and Neeson. It had an implausible plot and dreadful acting. Felt like these outstanding actors needed to make a quick movie to pay the bills that week."
3,Not as sturdy as decribed.,I found these to be somewhat flimsy. I need more support than these supply. They do help a little but I would not purchase them again.
3,They help,"I have a heel spur that is very painful, these have helped relieve some of the pain...would recommend them to a friend"
1,Useless unless you can glue it in place,"Within 50 steps these heel cups rotate 90 degrees and become very uncomfortable in the shoe. I don't know about you, but I don't have time to keep taking off my shoes at work and realigning them.By the other style of heel cushion Tuli's makes here:http://www.amazon.com/Tulis-Heavy-Duty-Large-175lbs/dp/B000MSZT7O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=hpc&qid;=1275889277&sr;=8-1"
2,Heel cups,Cups are not worth the money they are soft and don't do the job advertisedvery unhappy with them and had to reorder Tuli's hard plastic cups later inanother order don't waste your money.Cups are to flimsy and to much jelly.
2,Tuli's heel cup,inserts slip too easily - do not stay in place. I find that a full insole works best
2,Mildly interesting,"Crown Jewels describes the evolution of Bell Labs from the gravy-train days under the Ma Bell monopoly to its struggling to stay alive under the faltering Lucent. Aside from back and forth chronology that confused me at times, I found the book to be well-written. However, I don't know that the material is worthy of a book. The entire volume is really summed up in one sentence: Life at Bell Labs was like academia until after the divestiture, and then no one at either Bell Labs, AT&T, the RBOCs, or Lucent really knew how to harness its energy. As somewhat of an industry insider, I was hoping for more details of its products and innovations, but such information was hit-and-miss -- the author talked about ""MapsOnUs"" in detail, but quickly blew over other products like VoIP and Softswitch."
1,outdated,We used the chapters on Cusco and Sacred Valley-Machu Picchu on our last trip to Peru and we found many outdated information and incorrect addresses. I understand there's the 2008 edition is out so buy the new one instead or consider another publisher. Friends of ours had the Fodor one and liked it a lot.
4,Very Informative,"I thought that Frommer's Peru was very helpful and quite accurate with the exeption of one restaurant in Cusco, Greens, which had moved and become vegitarian. It's descriptions and opinions were enlightning, if not at points overcautious. I would have liked more on Lima. The bood discouraged travelers from going there, but I thought it was very nice in Miraflores. Highly recommended for anyone considering going to Peru."
3,Frommer's Peru,"This a good book for a first timer to Peru. Especially if you want basic information on hotels & restaurants, etc."
5,True but Incredible Story,"It seems like the release of previously secret information from World War II will never end. This book is based on information from the OSS archives that was finally released in 2000. It tells a story that was simply unknown before.Fritz Kolbe was a walk in. One day he walked in to the OSS office in Switzerland and offered to spy on Germany. Both the British and the Americans were very concerned that he was a double agent. Eventually though Allen Dulles, then head of the OSS in Switzerland took a chance with him.Kolbe was a medium level officer in the German foreign office. He was not a Nazi and became disenchanted with the Nazi regime. All in all he passed some 2,600 secret documents to the OSS.After the war Kolbe wanted to continut working for the German Foreign Office. But the Nazi officials who had by then re-entered the German government considered him a traitor and refused to employ him.The CD is read by Michael Prichard, who has recorded some 430 full length books."
1,Avoid,This recording is dreadful; sounds like cats and dogs howling in an echochamber somewhere off in Montana.
2,Fossil-Punk from 1977,"This ferociously dumb collection of Auld-Skool punk assaults the ears like an old harridan yelling for the rent. One song's pretty much like another, and after awhile the listener just numbs out listening to YET ANOTHER leather-throated caterwaul on sex, drunkenness, drugs and Beavis & Butthead (for god's sake!). The album was NOT recorded in 1977 but 1998, so there's no excuse. Nice photos, tho'. I've seen the singer perform live and she's a lot bigger and fatter than the pix would lead you to believe. NOT a pretty sight!"
5,This is his first try,"I just want to set the record stright. This is mario winans first single off his first cd that came out in 97. Some people dont know about his first cd. This is not his 2004 single i dont wanna know. Any his 97 single i dont know is a very romantic,beautiful song that should have dont better. Just listen and you wont be dissapointed."
5,a masterpiece,"I saw the Kletter sister's in a small bar in Chicago a few weeks ago. Silly fool that I am, I paid more attention to my beer and companions than the music...at first. Slowly, without notice, the bar disappeared. I was bewitched by the unexpected treasures of each and every song played. I spent the next few days wandering around singing ""Karen died, she died,"" under my breath. Finally, I couldn't stand it. I walked out of my apartment at 11pm, found a music store, and stayed up half the night listening to the wonder that is ""Dear Enemy."" Dana and Karen have remarkable voices of similar range. Part of the fun of this is getting to know them individually, and discovering the similarity and difference in sound and (written) voice. Their work is personal, thoughtful, filled with angst, but balanced with a sly humour."
1,One twin too many,"A major disappointment. I liked Dana Kletter's work in blackgirls and Dish, but this album's minimal melodies and hyper-refined sensibility don't do much for me. Two songs each about relentlessly mundane topics (Mom, Dad, sisters, the beach, etc.), rendered by two ""trained"" voices, two pianos, and, yes, strings -- it's intentionally claustrophobic, but also on the precious side. (I caught myself thinking, ""well, your parents split up, but at least somebody paid for all those music lessons."") Dana Kletter seems to do her best work when partnered with a rougher, more dynamic partner, and her identical twin sister isn't it."
4,Deadwood Season Two,The item was received in excellent condition in a timely fashion. The disks were in excellent condition and played with no problems. I really enjoyed the extra features disk. My only complaint was with the price of the set I don't think I should have been subjected to HBO's commercial at the start of each episode on the first disk. They also made it so you couldn't fast forward through either. It's a good thing they did not include this on the following disks or they would have gotten a nasty E-Mail.
1,awful,Well I thought as loving history on the western towns it would have been more interesting but found it to be a bit graphic. Thank God for the womens movement!!!
4,I like it,The first and second seasons are good... the third season is a little odd... that's probably why they canceled the show.
5,amazing,I love this show. Wish it would never end! I haven't felt this way about a show in a LONG time.
4,Lots of cussing,I loved the story but hated all the cussing. If you can get past all the F words then you will enjoy it.
1,I haven't received it yet,MY REVIEW IS I THINK I GOT REAPED OFF I HAVEN'T RECEIVED THIS ORDER YET AND I ORDERED IT December 11th and the seller is not responding to any of my emails. I am very disappointed.
1,Deadwood - The Complete Second Season,"I needed to return this item to Amazon. There was a manufacturing defect with the dvd package. The dvd was marked ""Second Season"" however when I went to watch it, it was the ""First Season"". I checked each dvd in the package, and they were all the same."
1,Deadwood for deadheads,"The overuse of profanity and sexual scenes really detracts from what Deadwood could really be. It's too bad that it has to sell itself to sex and profanity starved people in order to survive.For Example, ""High Noon"" starring Gary Cooper is the best western ever made and it has not sex or profanity, just great acting, a great story and great music. I would recommend that people avoid this series like the plague until the writers and produces stop relying on the aformention central theme of how cool non-stop profanity sound in someone's living room.JMSt Paul"
5,Best that HBO has done!,"Again, the title of this review says it all. Too bad HBO didn't do a fourth season!"
3,1st season far superior than 2nd season,"The writers seem to lose their way right from the first episode of the 2nd season. Characters become bedridden for too long to be interesting, promising characters and plot-lines from the first season are left dangling, and the death of the boy seemed out of step (what exactly was the point of that development?). Apparently the main writers changed after the first season and I suspect that offers at least some explanation.If you liked the 2nd season that's great, but I found it a pale shadow of the often brilliant and brutally poetic first season."
3,Deadwood - 2nd Season,"The series itself is excellent. Too bad it isn't still in production. The quality of the actual DVD however, can be seriously called into question. There are quite a few blips and stoppages throughout all of the DVD's. The actual box and DVD holders are of very low quality (the push button to pop out the DVD's breaks upon 1st use). But, for what I paid for it, I guess I shouldn't complain. I already owned Season 1 and Season 3 - not a single problem with quality of any kind there."
4,A Brilliant Piece of Work,"As a dyed-in-the-wool Deadwood fan I continue to think Deadwood is one of the most brilliant period pieces ever done for this era. It would be difficult to conceive of better set design, costume, dialogue, or character development than Milch does it. That having been said, I didn't think season two quite rose to the level of season one but then season one set a pretty high bar. The story kinds of drags in places. But I will also say they do a stellar job of wrapping up the season in episode 12. Season two's concluding episode was better than season one, and Al's last line, standing up on the porch, watching Bullock wander back down the street, is absolutely priceless! Season one and season two of Deadwood are both imminently watchable, however, and worth buying. A great series but not appropriate for kids. If you've never seen Deadwood, you'll never look at Pork the same way again once you see Wu's pigs, either.....(real Deadwood fans are laughing right now)"
4,Excellent Quality/ Slow Shipping Time,Love the series and sad to see it is no longer airing - this box-set arrived in excellent condition - and I would have given it a lower rating because it took more than 14 working days to arrive but I love the series.
3,Content is great but the formatting SUCKS,"When i started to watch the second season of Deadwood today i learned to my bitter disappointment that each disk is formatted so that you have to watch several minutes of HBO commercials before you can watch Deadwood. There is NOTHING you can do about it except watch unless you turn down the sound and go do something else for several minutes.Heretofore on every DVD i have bought it has at least been possible to fast forward through the commercials. Hereafter i will investigate and if any other DVD's, HBO's or anybody else's, are set up the way the Deadwood set is I won't buy them. I did not pay $62.96 to put up with that kind of stuff. Sheesh!Had it not been for the forgoing formatting issue, I would have given the Deadwood DVDs 5 Stars. As it is, i thought about giving it 1 Star and finally compromised on 3 Stars.."
2,What's to understand?,"It seems a lot of people just can't understand why this show is getting cancelled. Simple. There's no story left to tell. What do you expect to happen from here? Promo for the next season: some more griping about whose jurisdiction the town falls under, A LOT more cursing, and somebody gets shot. Plus they'll say ""thoroughfare"" about a million more times and talk like they're reading from a script. Wow, impressive. Yes, you heard it here first!"
5,Deadwood is amazing,"I am a great fan of Deadwood, and I have not been disappointed by this disc set. Just like the first season, you are drawn right into the story, and cannot wait to see what happens next. Highly recommended watch."
3,It would be better if...,"This book is helpful when learning American Sign Language terms for Sexual Behavior. However, it is hard to distinguish hand positioning at times. The book uses drawings of a person signing the ASL vocabulary words. It would be easier to determine hand and finger placement if they had used photos of people signing instead of drawings."
3,Signs of Sexual Behavior: An Introduction to Some Sex-Related Vocabulary in American Sign Language,"Book was helpful in interpreting some vocabulary in a course related to sexual behavior, however book was old and did have region related signs."
4,Sorry for being inappropriate...,"I'm not deaf and I don't know deaf people, but I love the book. I found it in my college library and me and my buddies learned all the signs. Years later, I saw it here on Amazon and had to buy it. Reading this book is like learning curses in other languages, and therefore, I recommend it."
2,"Dull, not very engaging cars toy.",While the concept of having various buildings from the cars move is a good one... this toy is lackluster. Not very much to interact with. And the road/ramps are awkward - don't really work well.
4,"Very helpful for ""survey"" and ""college accounting"" courses","This well-written text closely tracks the content of ""Survey of Accounting"" and ""College Accounting"" textbooks and courses offered at many community and 4-year colleges. (""Principles of Accounting"" courses are similar, but they contain more theory than the other two. This book is still good, but might need some supplements.) The exercises and problems are excellent, and the solutions appear right after them so it's easy to check your work. I would have given 5 stars if there were a few more memory aids and helpful hints to make learning the material even easier. But overall, very good and easy to follow."
5,multigrain cutlet from Worthington Review.,Multi-grain Cutlets are a vegetarian source of protein and fiber. Excellent. Bake or fry them or cut and put in casserole. Makes great sandwiches.
3,If you love soy sauce...,"...then these are fantastic. I tried breading and frying a couple of them, but could not get past that stong soy sauce flavor. For the remaining cutlets, I discarded the liquid from the can and soaked them for a day in a mock beef broth. The taste was more to my liking after I did that."
5,A gently humorous and heart warming and beautiful British road trip,A gently humorous and heart warming and beautiful British road trip. The details and experience have a very authentic air - from the choice of vehicles and locations - the inadequacies of typical student jalopies for the trip to Scotland - to the problems of vehicle recovery and subsequent adventures.A lot of the humour comes from the incongruence of real life - there really were Ice Cream wars in Glasgow and gangsters really did kill each other over the Scottish addiction to sticky sweet confections.
2,Problem connecting to PC,"I could not get my PCs to recognize the binoculars after connecting to the PC via the USB cable. I tried Windows 98 SE,Windows XP Home Edition. Both have the latest Windows updates. I also tried installing the supplied drivers. But, still nosuccess.I called tech support. I was forced to leave a message. The voice mail said it would take 48-72 hours for a response.The only reason I gave 2 stars rather than 1 is because I like the design and feel while viewing."
5,"3M Micropore Paper Tape - 2"" x 10 yds Tan - - Box of 6",I have to cover my stoma several times a day and I have found the 3M Micropore Paper Tape to hold the best while still allowing the skin to breathe somewhat. A plus foe me the color matches my skin and is hardly noticeable. I highly recommend it.
5,Great tape for delicate skin,"this tape works great does not pull on skin or leave any residue, this bulk tape has become hard to find in my local drug store"
5,Just as described!,"Definitely recommend this product! Who wants ""white"" tape when you can have TAN tape! Easy to use and little-to-no tape residual which is a bonus."
5,"Super for Music Play book Hinges, great multi-purpose tape..","I purchased this tape to use for compiling music play books. I used it has a hinge to fasten together clear plastic protector sheets that contain my music. The music is filed in 3-ring binders. It works great! I have used the books every day and the tape is holding up very well with heavy use. It is easy to apply, and if you make a mistake, it is easy to remove and replace. Since my original project, I have used it to make labels on plastic ware stored in the refrigerator and freezer. It performs with excellence! It is also great for medical use in wrapping gauze bandages. It holds well and the bandages don't slip."
4,Does the Job!,I needed these items for school bags we were gathering at school. It was a great buy and savings. The product did the job and works.
1,Stench-o-rama,And I thought Bill Nelson was the only artist who put out a CD every time he cut a fart. This is nothing but re-hashed old material and demos. Do not bother with this POS unless you are a rabid fan that must have everything Andy Partridge ever recorded (his shopping lists are probably more interesting). One song consists of a BS session that seems to have been recorded accidently. Stick with the true studio albums and stay away from this garage mistake. Andy should be full-blown embarrassed.
4,Rough Hewn Song Carvings,"Andy Partridge is one of music's greatest minds: Lennon & McCartney, Jagger & Richards, Partridge & Moulding. Why a well-built piece like Dame Fortune never made it on a release is beyond me. Hey Goosey Goosey, Wonder Annual, and Everything are also sturdy tunes. My only complaint: the disc is a little short (60 min.).More please.[DW]"
5,scrumptious sheets,"These are wonderful sheets!I got the Ginsing color.They wash and dry in great fashion with nary a wrinkle. And after you make your bed, and glide yourself in, they feel absolutely great.I am looking forward to buying more in the ""desert palate.""You won't go wrong buying these sheets!"
3,interesting,"Perhaps I'm too much of an American, but the preponderance of human(?) skulls, animal skeletons, and taxidermied animals freaked me out. Still I have to give the author points for not just including the usual collected suspects. There are small knitted sweaters, used paint palettes, and brightly colored Tin Tin posters. Some of the interiors look quite ugly to me (turquoise paint with gilded trim), but entertaining nonetheless.I hated the organization of the book or rather the lack thereof. The same collections can appear in three different chapters. The repetition made me nuts. The redundancy really annoyed me."
5,An album written for the state of our nation and its needs.,This album was very well written and very fitting for the time that we're in. I believe that our country needs a Christian revolution and our main weapon will be love. We need to change the present view that people have for Christians today and I believe this album is encouraging us along that route.
5,A great CD!,"4-Him's newest CD is nothing short of their capabilities. The music is great, the lyrics are fantastic, and the vocals are fantastic. Loved the CD!!!!"
3,decent album,"priest returns with a pretty good album, not great by any means, but still pretty good. good music, some silly lyrics. my favs are 'judas rising' and 'demonzier' i also like 'angel'. my least favs are wheels of fire and the last two tracks, also deal with the devil and revolution are pretty average songs. for 50 year old rockers, it's not bad, much better than the horrible 'ripper' albums, and about on the same level as painkiller, mabe slightly weaker."
3,buy the limited edition with the separate DVD instead!!,"I would recommend that no Priest fan buy the DualDisc version of Angel of Retribution.The documentary ""Reunited"" is 10-minutes shorter than the version on the separate DVD from the limited special edition.That edition costs more, but if you consider yourself a HUGE Priest fan, there is only one choice here."
5,Damn you to hell if you don't like this CD!!!,"This album is right up there with ""Painkiller"" definitely beats the crap out of all those lame MTV approved rock bands of today."
3,"""BRAVE NEW WORLD"" phenomenon repeats itself...","The ""BRAVE NEW WORLD"" (from Iron Maiden)phenomenon repeats itself...Fans awaiting so eagerly for a new release from their favorite line-up gives five stars review and hail the album as if it was the best ever from the band, or compare it to their best classics... With the passing of time, people will see this is not the truth.At least, contrary to Iron Maiden, Judas still is energized, they still play vigorously"
2,Great Music Crappy Disk!,Dual disc's suk. I can;t play this CD in my car. 2005 Volvo nor does it work in my wifes 2006 Toyota. WTF! I'll buy it again if it's in a single disk format.
4,Take No Chances And Deliver The Goods,"Halford's official return to Priest is a pretty good listen. I give it four stars because the album was damned good, but not as deadly as Painkiller and Screaming for Vengeance.So what, though. This is an excellent piece of work.The band took no chances. There are no jugulator type departures, and most of the stuff is downright melodic.Halford sings, screams, and does everything you expect on a Priest album.The guitar work is pretty good, but doesn't blaze any new trails, although it's still light years ahead from the usual metal fare.The DVD is entertaining, with the highlight being the live version of Diamonds and Rust, where Halford sings as never before, exhibiting that he indeed has a great voice on multiple registers.Angel of Retribution, above all things, serves notice that Priest is way back, and will hang around as long as the guys in the band can get enough energy up to go out and do it one more time.Good stuff!!"
4,Back and still rockin',"I'll make this brief. BUY THIS CD!! If you ever liked any Judas Priest in the past- you will love this CD. The sound on this is very much like their old sound, and thats very good news. With Rob back in the band there is no reason for them to try and sound like anything other than ""classic"" Priest. They bring it together with great songs and hard hitting production. The guitars are fat and blazing and Rob's vocals are better than ever. I would give it a five except for the last cut on the album ""Lochness"" - it's just dumb. (Spinal Tap was reportedly based to an extent on Judas Priest. This is the Judas Priest version of ""Stonehenge"".) The DVD is excellent and has a number of great live performances from the 2004 tour."
4,Real Heavy Metal (British -Style),"Judas Priest does not disappoint on this new album. Don't let their age fool you, they just get better and better. ""Demonizer"", ""Judas is Rising"" showcase the spirit of Judas Priest. Mellow-er tracks such as ""Worth Fighting for"" and ""Angel"" might be slower but they are no less powerful. The rest of the album is A+.The real selling point of this album is this: producer ROY Z. Anyone who is a fan of Halford (solo project) or solo Bruce Dickenson will know what I'm talking about!!"
3,Good in parts. Total cheese in other spots.,Not bad overall. Until you hear the track Lochness. This could win the prize for the song with the most cheese. The lyrics are regretful.
1,One Star for the Fact that the Product Actually Exists,"You've got to be kidding. Dual Disc is the biggest recording industry ripoff I've seen yet. The advertising says that it will work on any CD player. A disclaimer on the packaging says it may not work on all CD players. If the disc doesn't agree with your player, no big deal, you just burn it to a blank disc and listen to that, right? Nope. The disc is copy protected. Well, how about creating mp3s so you can at least listen on your portable player? Wrong again, the disc isn't recognized! That leaves only one option . . . buying the more expensive deluxe edition, whether you actually care about the DVD content or not. Is this legal?"
2,This is not worth your money,"This Album was not at all up to the standard of Judas Priest. I enjoyed many of their albums such as Painkillers, British Steel, Point of Entry and etc. This album is not any good. There are 3 decent songs on here:Demonizer,Hellrider,Lochness .Download those songs then move on. I am pretty sure I'll get negative feedbacks for this, but come on here people, Are you even listening to this before reviewing it? If you wanted a good Painkillers sounding album, pick up Halfords Resurection.Judas Priest is dead, like Black Sabbath. Stuck in a endless rut of trying to make everyone in their fanbase happy. Because of this, the music is souless. Take a lesson from Iron Maiden, boys!"
3,decent album!,"I know at amazon fans usually try to make every new release out be their best, but AOL is a decent but not great album. Nothing more and nothing less. Just decent!"
5,"""FROM CHAOS TO DESTINY!""","I got this album the second day it came out in March. I owned British Steel and Stained Class, to name a few, before this so I was a little worried that after 15 years since the last Judas Priest album with the classic lineup they might not deliver like they once did. All my fears vanished when I heard ""Judas Rising."" This album is truly great,my personal favorites being ""Judas Rising"", ""Demonizer"", and ""Hellrider"", though all the tracks are solid.The only exception would be ""Worth Fighting For"" wich, to me, is cheesy and kina' weak. ""Lochness"" is a cool song, but moves too slowly. ""Angel"", of course, is a beautiful song that really evokes a lot of emotion.The DVD has the documentary, wich is not that interesting, but has some good live footage.This album is definatley a good buy for anyone into metal. And everyone who gave this album a bad review can bugger off!"
4,screaming for retribution,"look up the word. ..anyway i just bought this today -and i actually like it - it's is not the worst priest by far. some killer licks over basic lyrics but don't look for shakespeare in heavy metal dude. only one i had to laugh at was ""lochness"" - thoughts of spinal tap and ""stone henge"" came immediately to mind. but all in all good headbangin' fun- the live bonus video is great - saw them at ozzfest and they were super tight."
4,Bow Down!,"Incredible priest album!I grew up listening to the mighty priest.I liked Tim(Ripper Owens),but Rob Is the voice of Priest and as a unit they are firing on all cylinders.what more can be said,but GREAT reunion album!Worth the wait!Rock is not dead!"
4,Welcome Back Rob.,"Here is the long awaited release by Judas Priest with the return of singer Rob Halford.....First off ..very good disc. ...Better than PAINKILLER...the guitar work of Glenn Tipton and KK Downing are superb!.... Lyrically some songs like ""Demonizer"" ""Judas Rising"" ""Hellrider"" have that PAINKILLER vibe to it...Fire,Hell,Demons,Fury,...which is OK but they spoonfeed it a bit... ANGEL OF RETRIBUTION has alot of bright spots too ..lots of catchy riffs from Glenn and KK like ""Deal with the Devil"", the first single ""Revolution"" ""Wheels Of Fire"" ""Worth Fighting For"" .....it's got two ballads ""Eulogy"" and the beautiful ""Angel"" which has one of the best Glenn Tipton solo's since ""Beyond the Realms of Death"". ....Plus there is the longest Judas Priest song ever recorded ""Lochness"" ...a 13 minute mammoth epic to close. .....Overall a very good Judas Priest album."
1,Absolute Crap,"Like some of the other 1-stars reviews I agree that JP lost their Direction back in the Early 80s. JP are like Metalicca, all their earlier stuff is awesome but their most recent stuff just sucks. If you want to hear the best of this band I'd recommend 'Unleashed in the East', 'Screaming for Vengeance' and certainly some of the earlier albums like 'Sin after Sin' and Sad Wings of Destiny'. This album is like their Painkiller album in that they are trying to keep up with bands that are 30 years younger than themselves, but its just all been done before. Glen Tipton has always been a great player, but now he seems to duplicate all the young shredders ideas. I'd recommend downloading a few MP3s before parting with your cash because I am sorry JP this is crap."
2,BUY IT USED...IF YOU MUST!,"I just picked up ""Angel of Retribution"" and ""Rapture of the Deep"" by fellow U.K. legends, Deep Purple. What I didn't see coming was, I felt bored by the new Priest, but really enjoyed the new Purple. Go figure. I feel like Deep Purple are growing ""older"" gracefully, but not Judas Priest. It sounds like they are selling out with this disc. But, if you like Deep Purple check ""Rapture of the Deep"" out.I guess ""Angel of Retribution"" needs the BONUS DVD, because it sure wouldn't be worth it on it's own. Buy it used...if you must.""Angel of Retribution"" - 2 stars""Rapture of the Deep"" - 4 3/4 stars"
4,Time for Retribution,"Some albums have to grow on you, NOT this one. From the monstrous opener ""Judas Rising"" till the operatic ""Lochness"" this album grabbed me immediately. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys Heavy Metal or hard rock music. However, if you're a Priest fan, you'll be in heaven.""Angel Of Retribution"" is filled with screaming vocals, crunching riffs, back and forth guitar solos, double-bass drums from the very first song. It's good. VERY good. This album will not disappoint at ALL.Anyone out there that needs any reminder of how unique this band is, this CD should provide the answer"
4,A return to the basics.,I'm a Priest fan up to Turbo and find a lot of the 90'a and Ripper Priest almost unlistenable (not all but most). The return of Halford helped the songwriting immensely and the metal is much more straightforward. I enjoyed reading all of the reviewers takes on Lochness. I'm a fan of the Nostradamus CD so I enjoy Lochness (very similiar sound as Nostr.) though the lyrics could be deemed silly at times. If your a fan of Seventies and early to mid eighties Priest I'll think you'll enjoy this CD.
3,A Mixed Bag,"Judas Priest has never been among my favorites. I could never put my finger on it, but something about Halford's vocals just never did it for me. I'm sorry to say that that feeling doesn't appear to have changed with this, their most recent release. However, the guitar work on this album is really strong, and makes up for my lack of excitement for the vocals. ""Wheels of Fire"" is a notable album highlight, and ""Angel"" is a strong metal ballad, before the powerful, riff driven ""Hellrider.""Sadly, despite its great moody guitar, I cannot get behind the lyrics of the epic finale, such as:""Loch NessConfessYour Terror of the Deep.""Come on. I can live with lyrics about Hell and demons and such, but Nessie? This would have been a much better track without such comically dorky lyrics. Shame.Overall, I'm very conflicted about this album. Halford's vocal performance wan't bad, but it still isn't my cup of tea. But the guitars were great, throughout. A mixed bag, really."
2,What is this?,"The first thing wrong with this album is not that they are all long past their prime and writing stale music, it is the atrocious digitized guitar sound. For one it makes the speakers crackle and two it sounds way too fake and processed. My theory is that this really obnoxious guitar sound is there to distract you from the inevitable realization that this is an uninspired and dull affair. There were times during a couple songs where I felt that magic coming together but in the end all I wanted to do was wash the taste of this out of my mouth with some Hell Bent Leather. This isn't really that different from what Halford has been doing on his solo albums either, which are far superior. And by the way, ""Lochness"" has one of the worst sounding putrid intros ever."
5,Priest! Priest! Priest!,"Top to bottom, one of the best Priest releases. Riffs are great and the Metal God is in top form. Great variety on this disc and that says alot considering there are just 10 songs. Give me 10 great songs over 15-20 mediocre songs any day. Buy it and the 2 disc version now! Priest! Priest! Priest!"
2,Painfully disappointing,"Very slowish in most parts, uninspired lyrics, and quite Ozzfest friendly (obviously to appeal to the new generation ""metalheads"" that waltz around town sporting AC/DC shirts they bought at Target). More in the same vein as the Ripper albums, which were very forgettable. Looks like Painkiller was truly the last of the finest."
1,Probably the worst CD ever,"A long time since this album has come out, I decided to remove the dust and cobwebs and give it a second chance. I have to be TOTALLY honest...this is the same atrocity I skipped through the first and last time. Most of the songs are mindless chug...not even worth writing a track-by-track interview about. Absolutely NO creativity seeing as MOST of the songs are in the same key as well, not to mention a 5 year old could pick out where the chord progressions are going off the cuff. My biggest disappointment, however, is the modern mastering done to the songs. Something about all recordings from the 60's to early 90's that just has a complete feel to them is missing, and leaves the CD sounding empty.I'd have to say ""Angel"" is the only song worth listening to, bringing me back to ""Before the Dawn"" times.Overall, I give this CD a ""2 Girls 1 Cup"" rating....disgusting."
2,gets old fast,"this CD from priest sounded pretty good on the first few listens, but after a few weeks of hearing these songs i noticed how fast these songs get old. I think priest will put out a stronger album next time."
5,AWESOME!!!,"Over the top vocals,enormous twin guitar attack, power, haunting and memorable melodies. ROB IS BACK!!!This is what HEAVY METAL IS ALL ABOUT."
5,Best intro to Freemasonry,"Although I'm not a Mason, I've sampled perhaps a dozen books on Freemasonry during the past year. As I read this book, I knew it was the resource I'd been looking for.I wouldn't have thought the subject matter would fit the ""For Dummies"" format very well, but it does. Although the book is encyclopedic in its coverage, it's always clear and lively, and it never takes itself too seriously. It's a fun and informative read, as well as a reference to return to. I recommend it as the best introduction to Freemasonry I've found."
5,A Masonic Essential,"As opposed to most masonic books, Hodapp's introduction to Masonry is written clearly and with a fair amount of humor. It provides the essential information about the history, values and symbols of Freemasonry without the mumbo-jumbo that so often makes Masonic literature abstruse and unclear. As well, Hodapp's book covers the controversies surrounding Freemasonry and its opponents.Don't be put off by the Dummies series imprint. This is essential reading for Masons, those interested in becoming Masons, spouses of Masons--who are always a little bit unsure about what their partners do in the Lodge--and people simply interested in demystifying Freemasonry.Hodapp's book is quite American Freemasonry oriented, but don't let that put you off. The information he covers is valuable for all. I am recommending this book to the members of my Craft lodge, which is in Brazil."
4,A must for every Master Mason,I found not all was true to my Jusisdiction but a good read. A better read for someone that is a new member or older member wanting to refresh his memory.
5,Excellent information,"Fun, informative, concise. I am enjoying reading each and every page. Dispels the myth and brings forth the mystery and reality of todays Freemasons. I am new to the whole area and as a newbie I am finding it a rare find!!!"
5,"A fantastic read. Perfect for history buffs, active Freemasons, and anyone interested in knowing the truth.","Freemasons for Dummies is an excellent book that provide fairly detailed information regarding the history, beliefs, interesting facts, myths, and lies surrounding Freemasonry. It is refreshing to read a book that consolidates this type of information in one place and provides clarity regarding the more ignorant and ridiculous charges leveled against the fraternity. I think the book is fantastic and encourage anyone interested in Freemasonry to read it."
2,Not a fan of For Dummies Books,"The information in this book is solid and I own it. However, I'm not a big fan of For Dummies books. There are a lot of other Masonic books out there that do a much better job. Masonry is not something that you get through as fast as you can, there is no completion. It is a lifetime of seeking light, so take your time, reading this book isn't going to make you a better mason, you will just know more stuff. The true light is in the journey not the destination."
4,Freemasons For Dummies,This is a great book and a wonderful introduction to the Freemasons. They dispell a lot of rumors about the Masons and educate people at the same time.
5,Author walks the walk!,"I was helping a descendant of someone mentioned in this book (Albert Leighton Rawson) find original sources for claims that he contributed to the founding of the Shriners and I had reached a dead end.I contacted Brother Hodapp by e-mail and requested his original sources, and within twenty four hours recieved a reply with links to the information that I had given up on finding.Needless to say, his book will now hold a prominent place on my shelves as a primary reference for any Masonic queries that arise in the future.A true scholar and gentleman.Fiat Lux!"
3,Why We Get Sick,"This is an interesting book about how certain diseases came into being - how some of them actually help us when we are young but become troublesome when we are old. There were good explanations for some diseases but the authors are unable to accept the notion that belief in God can be compatible with the knowledge that germs and bacteria change, mutate, and develop quickly. To me, that is as blind as scientists accuse Creationism of being. It implies that there is only one correct answer and denies the importance of compromise in every facit of life. Both sides have to accept each other and compromise to find truth in medicine."
2,misleading,"This book should be renamed 'An ultra-Darwinianist guide to why we get sick'. This book is written for doctors and laypeople who persumably know very little about evolutionary theory. However, nowhere in this book do Williams or Nesse acknowledge their ultra-Darwinian bias. I took objection to many of the things this book proclaims and the asumption that everything is an adaptation. This book is potentially very powerful and has some good points but was ruined for me by the arrogant assumption that this particular view of evolution is without debate."
4,A Different Perspective,"This book offers a stimulating challenge to medicine and a thoughtful discussion of how (Darwin) evolution theory applies to us. Mr. Nesse and Mr. Williams provide a careful survey about how evolutionary factors can shape and affect human health - the causes and effects are being discussed in a plain-language manner. Have you ever thought about how the sneezing, the fever, and the coughing are all front-line responses of our immune system? Why do you think the once-eradicated TB come back with a more potent strand? The book provides a refreshing yet convincing view that bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an everlasting arm race."
4,Practically reads itself,"This book is extremely readable, and hard to put down. The authors make a very compelling case for the usefulness of a evolutionary perspective in medicine. I have a couple minor complaints (but don't let this discourage you). The authors seem to move freely between fact and speculation, without making clear distinctions. Not a problem if you're paying attention, but they may sometimes give the impression that their is more data to support a contention than there actually is. Anyway, I highly recommend this book - it's easy to read, stimulating, and bound to make you look at illness and health in a new way."
5,One of the best books on science in a long time.,"This book is about the exciting field of Darwinian medicine.In this book the authors describe why (and not how) wesuffer from various diseases. Looking at diseases from anevolutionary viewpoint gives us tremendous insight andoffers innovative ideas for treatment and prevention.Though I tend to treat radical new ideas with skepticism, Ifound most of the arguments in this book very convincing.Apart from being ingenious, this book is also veryentertaining and easy to read.In my opinion this is the science 'Book of the decade'"
5,One of the most interesting books I've ever read!,"This book is incredibly interesting. So many books talk about how things happen: how the virus attacks your cells, how people heal, etc. However, this book discusses WHY these things happen which I LOVE.When I first bought this book, I was a little bit wary of the title ""The New Science of Darwinian Medicine"" and I expected the book to be some extremely radical view on evolution. However, everything stated in this book is an extremely reasonable and logical explanation to how certain things came about in humans. It presented a whole new way of thinking about things that I found absolutely fascinating.I highly recommend this book!"
5,Combo of travelogue and recipes,"This as an estheticaly beautiful, artsy-looking book with high quality pages, cover, illustrations and a gorgeous cover design.Well written, the food descriptions will make your mouth water; the descriptions of places will make you feel as if you're there.What's unusual is that this book combines recipes with the travelogue, about 50/50.Recommended for all foodies with an interest in Italy. And for everyone interested in Italy who also appreciates good food."
3,"Subtitle Should be ""Voyages on a Bottomless Stomach""","If you seek to understand the minute subtleties and regional differences of Italian food, this is a wonderful, lovingly written book. But if your head is turned by the subtitle, ""Voyages on a Vespa,"" save your money. You will be disppointed that the two Vespas he uses for months and thousands of miles barely get mentioned. There is one small, generic photo of a scooter at the beginning of the book, and one of an odometer towards the end. When he returns the rental scooter at the end of his journey, he sums it up by saying, ""It was a brisk, unsentimental parting."" As a Vespa enthusiast, that will also sum up how I react to my parting with this book."
3,"Good Stories, Little Instruction","This is a good read for any golfer. I read this after finishing Ben Hogan's Five Fundamentals and was expecting something along the same lines. This book is more of an anecdotal book of Harvey's stories throughout his life. Their are useful tips and tricks, but if you're looking to learn how to form your swing, of fix some of your major flaws, this might not be the best book to start with. Definitely worth a read though."
4,Simple Truths,"This book came highly recommended to me by a family member. Mr. Penick shares very simply his thoughts on improving one's golf game interspersed with quaint stories. An enjoyable read, and an invaluable teaching guide."
4,There is a lot....,"It's a good book, but you have to read it more one time to discover in some cases what Harvey is trying to say you. The book has a lot of pearls."
1,"Too much fluff, not enough substance","If you are interested in reading all about who Penick knows, who he taught, and who he has met then by all means, buy this book. If you are looking for clear, concise direction on how to improve your game, get Ben Hogan's Five Lessons book. The little red book is full of every name Penick could drop, but severly lacks in the help department. Sure, there are a few helpful tips, but they would barely fill up a brochure let alone an entire book. Bottom line; a slightly entertaining read, but not all that helpful."
5,GENIAL GOLF FROM GENTLEMAN PENICK,"HARVEY PENICK'S LITTLE RED BOOK: LESSONS AND TEACHINGS FROM A LIFETIME OF GOLF is a must have for any serious golf library. Filled with anecdotes, stories and practical golf advice, Penick's book is a forthright, enjoyable read. No wonder these lessons had such an impact on the likes of golf greats Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, both of whom were Penick proteges.Penick's book also lends a classical look at a classical game. With all that's going on in the world of golf today: the exorbitant salaries, conflicts about equipment and vintage courses becoming too short, Penick's book reminds us that once upon a time golf was a genial game instead of a rabid business. Read it and gain some needed perspective on the greatest game in the world.THE HORSEMAN"
4,golf and life...,"This is an excellent book for those looking for tips to improve their game. In addition, Penick provides lessons for life; his humility and knowledge both are evident. He taught students how to play golf, but he also taught them to enjoy it, as well as providing lesons in being a better human being. I also bought Ben Hogan's Five Lessons; it is a fine book I am using as an ongoing lesson, but Penick covers much more than just golf..."
2,Did not gain much in terms of technique.,"This is a book of anecdotes, rather than any solid fundamentals. It is more in the style of abrupt episodes with little to connect them. While they are fun to read at times, there is not much in here for a beginner wanting to learn the fundamentals of golf. Buy the Ben Hogan book instead."
4,A Good Walk Spoiled (Golf Defined),"This book contains many entertaining anecdotes gathered over the course of may decades. Harvey Penick chose to become a teaching golf professional rather than barnstorm the country during those early years of golf tournaments when many professionals were simply glorified hustlers. Eventually Penick became widely respected and many notable players and duffers stopped over to visit him at the practice tee. Over time, the wooden shafted golf clubs gave way to titanium steel.I certainly enjoyed the historical perspective that the book provided. Although some golf instruction is included in the book, it is more of a nostalgic look backwards to days spent in the Texas sun mowing the lawns and watering the greens. Reading a book like this is not a bad way to spend an afternoon. Harvey Penick had a good life.If you are searching for a serious golf instruction manual, however, you may want to choose another book."
5,son-in-law,hard to buy for son-in-law keeps this book handy for re-reading chapters. was happy he is enjoying it hope it helps his golf game.
2,I don't know what all the fuss is about,"This is a very famous book, and so I looked forward to reading it with a lot of hope that it would help my game. I found it to be pretty close to useless, and would certainly never recommend it to anyone. It does, however, do a good job of exalting Harvey Penick, which may have been his purpose in publishing it."
2,Too much information for the beginning golfer.,I understand that people will look at this and think of is as enjoyable but there are so many ideas of how to improve your game as to make it confusing. I would not suggest this book to a golfer unless he can already shoot in the high 80's or low 70's consistently.
3,Good not Great,"The book is stuffed with some good stories and it'll make you smile. It really lacks a lot of technical details but I will say Penick makes it a point that he is not an overly technical teacher. He does mention ""the move"" about turning the hips to the left and tucking the right elbow to the body (the tucking of the right elbow is not explicityly mentioned in Hogan's five fundamentals, Hogan explains it with the downswing plane). If you really want to learn how to play golf I'd say read Hogan's five fundamentals. This book is heart warming and positive and does contain things such as the mind set you should take to the course but if you gave this book to a beginner they'd have a hard time translating most of it to a good swing in my opinion."
4,great read for the right golfer,"This book should be read in conjunction with taking lessons from a qualified professional instructor. Its message is a valuable one, but not so much for the beginning golfer, and the book is quite clear in stating as much.. At no time does the book pretend to be an instructional guide for those who've never played the game."
1,"Pointless, boring, a waste of time...","I read this book while I was in a tent high on the upper part of Kilimanjaro, looking for some inspiration, and got nothing but a silly story about a rebel seagull. Apparently, it's supposed to be an allegory. Apparently."
2,poor quality,The book was not in the condition stated by the seller I know this book has been around for ages but don't say its like new when its not I lost my original copy so I really wanted another one just to have so my grandson who is 11 months can read it one day so I really love the book just not the condition I got it in
1,I'd rather have my eyes pecked out by seagull than read this again,"Of all the thousands of books (on all the many topics and themes) I've read in my life, this has to be the single biggest piece of drivel I have ever had to endure.Given to me as a present, I assumed it was some vanity press self-help crap. When I googled it and found this book was and had been popular for decades I felt like killing myself and all the human race as well.Depressing.I have always despised the concept of burning books, but will make an exception with this one."
4,High Performing Seagulls,A great parable for the extraordinary life written as the lifestory of a seagull.A good book to get you thinking.
5,beautiful,"i always rave about this book to my friends, but i refuse to lend it out; if there was ever a book every single person ought to own, it's jonathan livingston seagull. at [the price] for the paperback edition, it doesn't set you back too far, and believe me when i tell you you will read it again and again and again. there is a certain empowerment, and more importantly, hope that comes from that tiny volume, and it is impossible to read it without take something wonderful from it. this book will change how you look at the world, and it will make it seem better."
4,A Flock Unguided,"This book was completely worth reading. After reading the book, I view us in society as the flock, and many of us are curios to learn about something different that may not be socially accepted or is beyond our understanding. The problem is we do not have guidence as the gulls do in the book from Jonathan. That being how I compared it to life, I still belive it is a valuble book to read because it can motivate us to strive to learn what we have a passion for and to share our knowlede. After reading about what a great gull Jon was we woiuld like to picture oursleves more like him, and it can influence the way we view life. This can only be a good thing! So, I recommend you read this if you haven't!"
4,Hits deep in a persons soul.,"Who knew that a story with such creatures like seagulls, could have a deep meaning. It really related to my life and to others around me. If only we were able to learn as the birds do."
5,Inspiration,We should all live like Jonathan! This is a book that says something different every time you read it. It is inspirational.
3,"Plagiarized, but creatively so","I liked this book. 'Twas warm, and fuzzy, too. Fact is, I liked it the FIRST time I read it-- when it was called ""Anthem"". Why is Rand's book so scorned, when a watered-down, half-baked tripe like this becomes so adored? I suppose just telling people what they want to hear has sales potential, if nothing else."
2,Childrens book for adults,"This is one of those books where it probably was better to have read it when it came out, in the era of the 1970s, in the United States. It`s better as a story one would read to their child because it does have some interesting points to be made albeit cliches we already know. But I also concur with some of the other critics that it is a bit overly done with the ""do whatever you fell like"" mentality, which I find to be destructive in the long term for a society. Just look at the current state of affairs in the States now (as of the writing of this review 2012) as we see what was once a great country is now faltering in so many ways, which is a direct result of the ""do what you feel"" philosophy. This is simply a book trying to push easy answers. But readers will get from it what they want to get from it."
3,jonathan livingston seagull book.,"the book was in fair condition, some of the pages were loose but it was readable."
5,Strive,"Jonathan is a symbol of eternal spirit striving to know what she is, why she is here? Jonathan redefines all accepted conventions of what is given(one is born with) Vs a human beings conviction to do what one believes in. The story is mesmerising in the intent that its happening with us and not with The Gull."
5,A great thriller,"A lost boy roaming the beach deperately. A rabies-infected starving seagull with a flambouyant disregard for the food chain. Bach sets the stage brilliantly for the fateful showdown, and helps us cope with the aggression of wild animals. Bravo! JLS is the greatest psyco-thriller of all time. I just wish the bird wouldn't have eaten the boy's eyeballs like that."
2,It's lost on me!,"I have never really understood the appeal that this little book has had for its thousands of fans. I find the writing simplistic to the point of irritation, and the subject matter banal.However, having said that, my husband adores it and would give it 5 stars. As I said, it's lost on me!"
3,Information I would have wanted to know,The book had a personally inscribed inside cover. I would have wanted to know this ahead of time and would have picked another seller.
5,It really secure me when I failed.....,"No genius comes from usual challenge. When I was in teenagers, I could not get along with my classmate. I thought I was the different one. I was indulged to read my fictions, and never cared about the entrance exam. As a result, I failed, and it shamed my parents. I was so sad to kill myself.But I had no courage to do that.Afterwards, I found this book in the bookstore, then bought and read it peacefully.Gradually,the seagull, Jonathan,raised up my self-confidence. It made me clear to search for what I really was. This book not only teaches us the unlimited abilities driven by desire and courage, but also gives the glory hope to the loser"
4,A good book but not without its flaws,"I read this book at a time in my life when I aspired to become an excellent musician. It was extremely inspirational and somewhat destructive. It follows the silly North American idea of being ""the best"" at the cost of everything else in one's life. Striving to be the best at something is counter-productive and will leave you empty and frustrated. There is more to life than being the best flyer in the group or whatever. So it's inspirational for trying to achieve goals but leaves out the downside of missing out on life. But this book is *not* mindless psycho babble. It is an interesting allegory and a decent book."
3,Highly over rated.,"I read this book because it was on my list of ""classics"" I had never read. It might make sense to list this as a children's book, but as serious literature, no."
5,A guidebook to life,"I first read this book in High School. It has, ever since, been an inspiration. The perfect book to read when you're afraid to take a leap to your future."
3,Read it a long time ago and got sucked in!,"I read this as a teenager, and I have to admit it, I got sucked in. O.K., let's get something out of the way: this isn't great literature, nor is it a great story. This is a sermon, a parable, a mildly entertaining allegory about seeking a higher purpose in life, not simply living for food (or money or job or survival or routine -- whatever else Bach and you might substitute here). For young adolescents this is an easy read with a good message. As simple and easy to read as it is, it really doesn't surprise me that it sold so many copies. I have no idea what kind of editorial reviews this received when first published, but I suspect they were mostly critical of the message's simplemindedness. Bach isn't subtle, nor is he morally ambiguous. But then, I'm sure this really hit the spot for the idealistic flower power children at the time. I only wonder what Bach thinks of it now."
5,My Favorite Book of All Time,"Of all the books in my library, this one is my favorite. I have read it many times, usually after wading through some great scientific or engineering work. I would recommed this book to anyone who has an open mind,a good heart and enjoys the ""flow"" that comes with near perfection."
4,A nice short story,Then first time I read it I was about 12 years old. When I finished it I did not understand what the book was about. But as the years went by I started to understand the book and I felt it was worth of reading it. It did not change my life or whatsoever but a nice short story is always welcome.
4,Jonathan Livingston Seagull -- A source of courage.,"Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach gives me the courage to keep striving for excellence even when the ""flock"" resists my efforts.Sometimes the biggest barrier between being mediocre and exceptional is peer pressure. In Bach's little book, Jonathan resists that pressure and soars to great hights. When he achieves as much as he can he cannot help but share what he has learned with anyone who will listen.I read the book at least once a year. It's like a motivational booster shot for me. Bach through Jonathan, has shown me that my road to happiness is to learn and share all that I can. It gives me courage to resist peer pressure."
2,A silly name for a seagull,"As I read many of the reviews, I was struck by how so many people saw Jonathan's life as a metaphor for their own. Well maybe I'm just not that deep, but I saw this as nothing but a story of a confused bird with an anxiety disorder. I'm sorry but the whole story was just a little too tough to swallow. By the way, I spent some time at the shore this summer, and I can assure you no seagull that I saw even remotely appeared to be as introspective and contemplative as JLS. Anyway, nice try Mr. Bach, but next time, let's make things a little more ""real world"""
3,"After you learn to do a miracle, its not a miracle anymore","John lovingston Seagull is a wonderfull book, in which i enjoyed thourghly. The first time i read this book it opened my mind to a whole new way of thinking and understading, so i moved on towards Richards next book, Illusions. After reading Illusions i found that ""seagull"" was just a small doorway into this new world of philosiphy. just like in illusions , ""once you've learned how to do a miracle, its not really a miracle anymore"". As for me, once i read ""seagull"" and ""illusions"" i reread seagull and found it to be less than what i originally thought. Every book i read opens my mind. I am currently reading the one, which so far is just as good as the others. I would recommend this great book to everyone and every age. Especially to those seeking more than what the standards of society set for us to follow."
1,Boring and pretentious book,"A poor immitation of the New Testament (with animals behaving like people), the book has little to offer for an adult reader. The author, as a former pilot, has intimate knowledge of flying, but for others the goal is hardly attainable, and thus - of little value."
1,A GROSSLY OVERRATED INSULT,"This book is an insullt to people everywhere. The fact that many enjoy it is shameful. This silly little ""children's book"" of about 90 pages with large type is about as intellectually stimulating as being hit in the head with a rock. It's plot and characters are dull, and the metaphorical garbage it spews out at you is disgusting."
1,Literature-wanna-be Hogwash for Pathetic People,"For a long time I had suspected that America was a nation full of pathetic people desperately striving to improve their lives. This so-called book has confirmed my suspicions. That most of the reviews for this piece of trash are positive is not surprising. After all, this book is full of the You-can-do-anything-you-want if-you-try-hard-enough nonsense that Americans cherish. That anyone would describe the author's overwrought, shamelessly manipulative, saccharine prose as good literature, however, is simply mind-boggling.People, please, get off your butts and start living your lives!! Trust me, reading feel-good, exploitative books written by savvy, if untalented, authors will do little to change your unsatisfactory existence."
3,Analogous to....,"Allright, the book was probably shorter than the review I'm about to write (it took me an hour to read it), and I was expecting to feel enlightened and happy after reading it, but I didn't. The book itself it good. I liked reading it and couldn't put it down. However, if you are looking for a book to ""change your life"", you may want to look elsewhere. If you are purchasing this book for the purpose of reading a classic, you've come to the right place. This is a sweet little story."
5,this book flies with the birds,"In this mini (93 pages, many pictures) classic, Richard Bach deals with a philosophy similar to the teachings of Mami. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, an aspiring bird, learns and listens. This book is very rewarding and philosophical."
5,Beautiful tale of a compulsive learner,"I first read this thin book with lots of black and white photos of flying seagulls at age 18, while taking a break from my intensive preparations for my ""A' level exams in the school library.It turned out to give me much more than a break: It set my spirits soaring as I read and identified with Jonathan for being so enthralled in doing what he loves doing that he ""forgets"" everything else. The other seagulls ""flew to eat"" while he ""ate to fly"". In a way, Jonathan is symbolic of people who ""live to learn"" while many others merely ""learn to live"".Since then, I've re-read this book two or three times at different ages - in my twenties and more recently, in my thirties. Its meaning to me and the feeling of kindred spirits turned out to be stronger than ever. This is now one of my prized possessions."
4,"Not as good as most of other books by Richard Bach, but nice","This was the first book by Richard Bach I read. It's probably the one of ""for all ages"" book I've read from him, I perceived it very differently when I read it as a teenager and then as a grown-up."
5,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"I thought that this book was great, I enjoyed every thing. I thought this book was also fun to read. To read about a seagull wanting more then just wanting to eat but to fly, fly higher and faster. This book is a really good book for younger children, they can learn from it, like if they want to acomplish something they should go for it. They should do what is exciting to them. This was a good book and I would deffinetly reccomed this book to other people to read."
5,Jonathan Livingston Seagull Book Review,"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is the perfect book for those going through a transition and wishing to maximize their personal development in the creative space. This book will take you only an hour or so to read, however it will have a huge impact on your life. The story is an analogy tracing the development of a seagull as it learns to free it's mind, and by doing so reach unprecedented performance. Although Jonathan Livingston Seagull was originally published in 1970, the book is timeless and I have a feeling there is knowledge within that I may have missed and will eventually pick up as I further evolve. May be useful to revisit at various points in your life.Once you've finished Jonathan Livingston Seagull check outGround of Your Own Choosing: Winning Strategies for Finding & Creating Workby Beverly Ryle."
3,Write Your Own Enlightenment,"I once read a review of this book that said something along the lines of ""it is so vague that anyone from Hindu to Roman Catholic could find meaning in it."" I agree whole-heartedly. This book contains so many mixed messages that anyone of any age at any time could find meaning in it. There is the admittance of a higher power (the Great Gull), and at the same time an extreme emphasis on the greatest importance of the self. Bach's tale of how the story came about(a voice in his head which dictated half the story to him then waited 11 years to dictate the rest) seems a little too far fetched for me. I think this book is a tiresome, low-vocabulary attempt at propheticism. If you're looking for meaningful allegories, go to your parent's book case and pick up a copy of THE LITTLE PRINCE...or create your own ""voices.&quot"
5,A MAGICAL BOOK THAT EVERYONE OF ALL AGES SHOULD READ!,"I first read this book 30 years ago when I was a teenager. Along with several other influences at the time, it changed my life in the respect that it confirmed the spiritual path that I had chosen for myself. Religion does not have to enter into this at all. There is a difference between Religion and Spirituality. This book contains a philisophical viewpoint that is truly inspiring and applicable to all age groups. It is as relevant today (if not more so!) than it was 30 years ago. If you read this book with an open mind, receptive to philisophical concepts, you will discover a meaningful message for everyone. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE GIVEN TO CHILDREN TO READ! I have just purchased a copy for my 8 year old daughter. I consider it to be a ""Must Read"" for her!"
1,"""Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story""","I've heard the raves about this book since I was a young woman & it first came out. So, when I happened upon it at a close-out sale, I bought it.I'm glad I didn't pay much for it.Maybe I am too old to appreciate the 'inspiration' that it is meant to provoke. I think I learned the lessons it teaches a long time ago - from my parents & in church. 'Life is to be lived, and since we are all in this together, we should try our best to make the world a better place'.Frankly, after reading, I wondered what the fuss is about. Yes, I caught what could be subtle inferences to spirituality, but I got a lot more out of other books I've read. But it's basically just a nice story about a bird. If inspiration & spiritual growth are your objectives, I recommend ""The Greatest Salesman in the World"". Another quick read, but much more substance than JLS."
2,"Eh. Not Bad. Not Great, But Not Bad.","A friend loaned me this book once when I was going through a very rough time in my life. Somehow, the book made me feel worse, so you may wish to hold off giving a copy to someone diagnosed with depression. Other than that, the book was very easy to read and straightforward. The philosophy of the book wasn't terribly deep. If you're looking for serious philosophy, look elsewhere. If you want an easy feel-good read, then by all means, read this book"
2,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,The best thing about this book for me was that it was so short. I really don't think I could have finished if it were any longer. I just don't get it. I found the book to be so simple that it was insulting. I felt like I should have read this at about 10 years of age. Profound? Hardly. Masterpiece? Certainly not. The only impact that this book had on me was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about... and I am still working on that one.
1,psycho-babble,"This book had to be one of the worst pieces of dribble I have read in years. I honestly don't understand how all these reviewers can give it 5 stars. I initiated it with an open mind and a willingness to contemplate its ""inner message"". However, upon completion, I merely felt deflated and cheated out of a decent allegory. I think the ad campaign for the US army already stole the moral to this story: be all you can be."
1,Boring and cliched.,"The first time I read this book I hated it. But, as an adolescent I assumed that I just didn't ""get it"" because everyone else loved it. My book group chose it last month and dutifully I read it again, hoping to understand what I didn't before.Unfortunately, now that I am older and wiser, I disliked it even more. Perhaps when viewed in its historical context, being published in the early '70s on the brink of all the self-help drivel that followed, it could be considered original or extraordinary. But to me, it was the opposite. It was as if Richard Bach was trying to incorporate every feel-good cliche and every religious idea into one marketable paperback.If this book changed your life, I am happy that you have been helped. For me however, I prefer the writings of real philosophers. This is watered-down junk for the masses."
2,Okay,I watched this movie back when first relaesed and always wanted to see it again. The first half was okay but got a little boring in the second half.I am glad I watched it but would bother again.
3,"Interesting, but lacking real truth","My teacher recomended i read this, and I was really looking foreward to reading it. But after starting I was dissapointed. The whole thing was about a Bhuddist seagull. Basically taking the theory of bhuddism and explainging it through an example of seagull civilization. It was an interesting book to read in less than an hour, but it had no real truth, and no real meaning."
5,An Amazing Literary Success,"As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I am still amazed by the success of Richard Bach's JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL. In an era when books are growing increasingly complex and complicated, Bach's book continues to stand out because of its simplicity. Bach spins a tale about a ordinary seagull who finds himself on an extraordinary spiritual journey. This book is a fascinating read, and Russell Munson's photography provides the perfect illustrations for the story. JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL remains one of my all-time favorite books."
4,"Sick of ""kitten poster"" philosophy?","Chicken soup for this, chicken soup for that, chicken soup for the idiot-who-doesn't-want-to-think-for-themselves- soul. If you're as sick of this tripe as I am then you'd probaly enjoy this one. So much wisdom in a very quick easy package without the ""christian"" slant so many supposedly uplifting story lean on. If you don't like it, oh well its only five bucks. Its a classic, buy two copies and give one as a gift."
5,Amazing,"I heard mention of this book, as it was a well read bestseller before I was born. I finally read it and couldn't put it down. It's about a non-conformist seagull who refuses to devote his life to finding food and quarrelling amoungst his flock. Instead he devotes himself to perfecting his flight, going higher and faster than any gull ever had before. He is eventually expelled from his flock, but continues his flight perfection. One day he is met by a pair of gulls who take him up to a 'heaven' where all gulls seek perfection. Rich in metaphors and open to interpretation, Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a beautiful book that makes you feel like you can achieve anything you want to, as long as you put your all into it. Also read Illusions by Richard Bach, which is a continuation of the ideas set out in Jonathan."
5,Helps you realize the purpose of life,"This is not just a book. It has the power to change the way you live your life, forever. It helped me understand the latent immense potential of every being, living and non-living. Everyone of us has a purpose, whether we realize it or not. All of us are capable of doing whatever we want to do. There are absolutely no limits to neither the strength nor the speed with which we can achieve what we want. Life has a meaning. If we can truly find what it is, we can get the real never-ending happiness in life."
2,All a bit fluffy and vague,I was kind of hoping this book would be inspirational about breaking free from the crowd. Unfortunately it was all a bit too fluffy to leave any real lasting impression. It'll be different for everyone but I didn't find anything I could apply to my life - perhaps because I am already an incandescent seagull transcending dimensions. CAWWWW CAAWWWW.
4,Great buy for any age dealing with the loss of a loved one,"Short meaningful read that helps its audience cope with tragedy. I read it five years ago at a funeral, and intend to reread it at funerals thereafter as a sweet reminder."
3,Flying high,"I read this book again recently - had a copy when it first came out that I gave away to a friend. It's one of those books that can help you to live in the here and now and to enjoy life simply by doing what you do best. Whether it's based on Buddhist or Christian ideas doesn't really matter, the story promotes the idea that each person (or seagull in this case) has a higher self - and it's important to let this higher self guide you to become a better person (or seagull). The central character, a seagull, is focused on flying perfectly, being totally in tune with himself and not distracted by greed, supremacy, belonging etc. It's a delightful tale, told simply with drawings of birds in flight, useful for those who get stressed out by the small things in life and need to learn about the bigger picture."
4,Awesome,I am a pilot also and can relate to the story. I can not fly anymore because brain injury due to a tumor so taking many meds just to stay functional.
5,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"I read this book years ago. This time i purchased for my teenage grandsons. An important life lesson, beautifully delivered."
5,Fly High,A great read for young and old alike. I first read this in grade 8 and I am now using it in my English classes in Taiwan. Students love it.
5,Jonathan Livingston Seagull,I read this book during my freshmen year in college. This book really give me a positive prospective of my own life. The author illustrations along with the plot of the story provide any reader with a real look at life for individuals from all walks of life. Excellent book to add to any library!
4,I think it is pretty good.,"The title of the book I read was Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach. The characters were seagulls and the main characters were Jonathan and Fletcher. The main setting was by a coastline. It was three parts long. The book was about a seagull that was concentrating more on flying than eating, which seagulls are supposed to do. He didn't listen though. He kept flying and flying. He was later taken away from the flock and lead to the cliffs. There he met the best seagull. He taught Jonathan everything. My favorite part was when he learned to fly in the past and future. I think you would like this book because it seems pretty real.By Edward Ryan, Jr. Age 8"
5,Great Book,"Less than an hour, no guilt, and you feel really good when you're done (unless you don't get it. Try again in a couple years). I've probably read it fifty times. Easily my favorite book."
2,Good material -- terrible presentation,"Freidlitz and Mondor are obviously experts in the field and their experience and knowledge are impressive. It's hard not to find the book valuable if you are at all involved in Exchange/Outlook projects. The book is, however, almost fatally marred by its atrocious syntax and grammar problems; and this makes learning from the text an overly onerous task. The publishing house obviously did not want to invest in a professional editor (astonishing given the price of the book!). Be prepared for an inordinately steep learning curve, due to these very same syntax problems. You almost have to be as knowledgeable as the authors to gain from their presentation! I cannot recommend the work as wholeheartedly as I can Thomas Rizzo's, ""Programming Outlook and Exchange""."
1,Can not recommend,I agree with the first reviewer-the presentation is just too poor. For the price I expected more in-depth coverage. It feels like the book was thrown together over a weekend.
5,A great reference book for any network administrator!,"Even though this book is written for advanced users, I found it would be useful tool and easy enough to follow for any LAN/WAN administrator looking to control their entire network."
2,"Agree with barjones, terrible presentation",Could use this book somewhat as a reference but this is NOT the book to get if you are just starting out. Not enough clear examples nor does it really have practical application examples. More of 'this is the line of code to do this'. Not really organized and seems like they 'threw' this together and didn't really care if the reader was learning anything. Kinda like that college prof everyone had that muttered to himself what was in his head but didn't notice to see if anyone was learning or listening.
3,A good start,This was a good alternative to training for power with weights. Since not everyone can get to a place to workout. I found it helpful in giving me another method to train. I also liked the small variations of each jump along with the jumps being listed in a simple progression pattern.
5,Excellent!!,"Item was purchased as gift for daughter. Her comments were,,,excellent. Very high quality item."
5,Steve -its all about the music,"Being a long time fan of Steve's, I knew that this CD would either prove to my friends and myself how special his songs werethat they were always much more than just some ""Glam Rock"" period of time he fell into.This Cd does is the proof and so much more ..I was even taken aback by the shear beauty of his early gems that I knew by heart played in such a different style yet some sounding even more passionate than the originals with all their trimmings.Steve Harley sadly (for us) never found a fan base here in the USA ... and on a side note also pick up his 77' LP/cd ""Hobo""if only for the remarkable guitar work by another genuis never acceped in the USA Marc Bolan."
3,"The Moghul is a good, slow read.",The Moghul most interesting story. A bit hard to read due to unfamiliar terms/names in India. Needs a bit of editing but still a good read.
4,"An Excellent Read, a free!!","The Moghul is offered free on Kindle, so I downloaded it and gave it a try. I am an avid reader of historical fiction and have been to India many times, so this book seemed a good it for me. It was an excellent read! It has enough juicy plot to keep you interested, enough history to teach you a bit, and some of the passages are very well written. Don't get me wrong - overall it is well written. But, there are some descriptions that are very, very good. For example, there is a wonderful description of the god Shiva as the Nataraj. It is one of the best I have ever read for a Western audience. And, I will be using it in a class I teach on World Religions. I don't know why this book was available for free, but I am very happy about it!"
3,It was Nice,"Story was nice. But a story which should have required 250 pages was written in over 500 pages. Descriptions of plots, characters and actions was so elaborate that they provide a nice visual picturization. But most of the time I tend to feel that this elaborate description only slowed down the pace of story."
4,A great read helped an Indian novice to an appreciation of this period.,"An exciting and interesting tale. It is well written and the complexities of the time are made comprehensible in the end, even while noting the vast differences between European and Indian sensibilities. Great characters and fascinating plotting."
4,If you liked Shogun you'll like this.,"Really enjoyed this novel. It's kinda Shogunish, but I mean that in a good way. It go's into some detail about Indian and Mogul customs and culture, I like that, some may not. The ending is rather vague, and apparently the author doesn't plan to continue.Given my intense dislike of long drawn out duologys and triologys I can't complain."
3,this is ok,"This is an ""ok"" book. I liked it at the beginning, but somehow, as I read more and more, it did not keep my interest. There was action and a great setting! But, somehow, I could not get into this book. I tried again a second time and had the same result. I like historical fiction."
4,Interesting Story,I have read a number of books by Thomas Hoover and he is a very versatile author who researches his subjects thoroughly this one is no different but perhaps it needed more research than most. The story is not entirely fiction but a blend of fact and fiction which works well but I found some of the later parts of the book particularly with the politics where lots of names were very similar heavy going. It is a book that could have been much improved on the Kindle by linking unusual words to the essential glossary which I wish I had realised was there before I got to the end of the book. In parts I found it difficult to realise who was being described as it sometimes jumped rapidly from scene to scene.It is however a book worth persevering with as it gives a fascinating insight into the culture and politics of India at the time before the Raj.
4,fantastic book,"Excellently written story in which Hoover takes you into 16 century India with a masterful combination of James Michner's historical novels and Clive Cusslers adventure. If you enjoy novels based on entralling historical events, intrigue, adventure and an amazing storyline, you will love this."
3,Not what I expected,"The book has great history and I normally love historical books, but this one was slow to begin and didn't really pick up until 3/4 of the way through. I felt like I was forcing myself to finish it."
2,too long,"The book was ok, it's just sooooooo long. I couldn't finish it, because it just drags and drags and it's neverending. But some parts of it are really interesting (e.g. shiptravel in old days, cultural shock for english captain coming to India etc.)"
3,"Some insights, somewhat obsolete and condensed history","The book does offer excellent insights into the workings of the PRI and Mexican culture, particularly from 1960-1985, a period glossed over by other texts. However, with the emergence of Fox and PAN, its observations do not reflect Mexico's current profile. If you're seeking an understanding of Mexican history pre-1960, ""Mexico: A Biography of Power"" offers a far more thorough and rewarding read."
3,it's in betweeen,The main reason I bought this book is because the description said it had to do with the Mexican Drug Cartels. Not really talks about it; more like a history of Mexico. It's alright.
3,Excuse me... what country are you talking about?,"It seems to me that Alan Riding wanted to write the ultimate book about Mexico, but that he was so desperate about being quoted that he exaggerates easily and allows himself a lot of ""poetic licenses"". There is a lot of gossip and common places in the text, half truths and many myths about the country (specially about the indians and their culture) that the american public eagerly wants to believe.I am a middle class mexican, living in an average city and my family is quite traditional, and I dont see my reflection or my ""portrait"" in this abundant description of the mexican society. I wonder if he was living in another country or probably in the poorest regions of Mexico while doing his investigation?The only thing that is worth mentioning is the 440 pages manuscrit (in the spanish version) which must ve taken a hell of time."
4,Fine Buy,It works great for my car audio system. Provides great sound quality and has a length that reaches the back row of seating in my car so that anyone can be the DJ on any car ride.
1,cable looks fine... but did not work on my jvc camera,"Got the cable, apparently looked fine, but as I hooked it up to my jcv camera and Philips TV, it didn't work.I was sad with the outcome but it was a gamble anyway to me because of the price."
3,plugged out performance,"Ths songs performed by Jack Bruce Band and his line up are great, but the quality of the recording and general live gig are boring and seem like plugged out without that electric typical feel for Jack Bruce. Though his excellent album of 1980 ""Ive always wanted"" and 1997 release ""Live at old grey"" might suggest that it is interesting performance I'd rather recommend to be prudent with that CD and not to expect an overwhelming live. Of the similar date are 2 bootlegs with Jack Bruce ""Live at bottom line"" and ""Live in NYC"" and they are much much better. I keep ""Vol.9"" in my collection only because JB is great."
2,Completely Ashamed,"I was the hugest FM Static fan after hearing their previous release. I was so excited to get their new one. What happened to these guys? It's just not good! By the 10th track, they finally warm up, but still are not near the quality of the entire previous album. Many of the first 9 songs are just dumb. The lyrics are dumb and the music isn't much better. Maybe I'm missing what the guys of FMS were trying to accomplish with this release, but for the happy fan, it's a let down. I realize that this is Thousand Foot Krutch's side gig, which sheds a little light on the lighter side of FM Static, but still, not near as impressed as I was with the debut."
2,Not Worth the Wait,"Towards the middle of FM Static's sophomore release, there is a tremendous song titled ""Next Big Thing."" However, the rest of the album is watered down, filled with ballads, and absurd lyrics. This would be tolerable if the songs were good, but only a few are. It seems like they are going through the motions on this disc, which is WAY below the standards they set on their debut album. The melodies are there, but the performances are lacking energy and it is way overproduced. The new Hawk Nelson or Stellar Kart CD is a better way to spend your money."
5,Probably best in its class,"I gave this 5 stars simply because it's the only one like this I've seen that isn't going break with ordinary use. The presses with the plastic end-pieces are doomed to break, no matter what you pay for the unit. I'm sure you could get a better, all-metal unit for more money, but for the price, it's a good deal.That said, I had problems with consistency with my first few batches. Near the end of the latest batch, I inverted the disk (set it so concave side was down) and I got much better results. What I miss most is the screw-type press my mom had years ago.Notes on this one:1) make sure the disks are concave side down2) make sure no air trapped when you add the dough3) be careful with the top ring when using or cleaning. Wrong moves can put it over the metal clip that controls how much comes out. Once that happens, it's like one of those aggravating wire puzzles to get put back in place."
2,Disapointed,I did read all the reviews and decided to go with this cookie press. Yes it does have everything you would need. It was difficult to operate and the top of mine kept popping off. I made a bunch of dough for Christmas cookies and after trying many times to make it work I have been unable to complete my cookies. So in addition to being out the cost of shipping both ways and the cost of wasting time and ingredients this has been a bad experience. Wish I could find a cookie press that actually works!
4,cookie press for CHEESE STRAWS,I make my own cheese straws and needed a new press. This is exactly the tool! It is metal - so heavy/dense batter still can be pressed out of the cylinder at a consistent size. Great Kitchen gotta have!
1,Got 12 cookies before this plastic piece of crap broke,"The top lever ""base"" is made of plastic and it completely broke after the 12th press down. The plastic simply broke apart."
3,Ok... Not In Love,"I recently had to replace my old cookie press and did a lot of review here on Amazon regarding cookie presses. I figured I would take the risk in purchasing this one. Now mind you, I am not an expert cookie maker, but figured it would do the job for me. I have experienced the cookie dough just coming out of the bottom around the disk into a blob on my baking sheets, and adjusted the dough mixture as I figured that was the problem. But, i must say that even with trying different doughs, refrigerating doughs, etc... it is still not the best purchase I have ever made as some cookies come out good and some well, not so much. Maybe I just need to spend more time in the kitchen to learn more about it."
1,Difficult to use,The instructions are very poor. After working with it for a while I put in cookie dough. Then when it needed more dough I could not get the item apart. I ended up just throwing it away. Don't need an item that takes me more time to use than not.
2,"Not so great, broke after one use","We were excited to try a new cookie press and this one seemed simple enough that it might work well. Prior to this we had owned a motorized press that was terrible. This press isn't much better. We could only get a couple of the shapes to work and the lever broke almost immediately. After that I had to press down with all my might to get cookies to come out (since the lever was what makes it effortless). Ironically, it worked better this way, but my cramped shoulder was the trade-off. We decided to give up and pay quite a bit more to buy a used old school cookie press (with the twist top) on ebay like both of our parents have."
1,Frustrating cookie making!,"Excited to use this for Christmas cookies. I read the directions, and began with dreams of easy, beautifully shaped cookies. Instead, you get maybe 4 that are the right shape out of an entire tube full of dough. The process to reload was awkward, and mis-colored the dough if I didn't thread the screw lid just right. In the end I got 24 cookies after about 1 hour of pressing. I'll go back to just cutting shapes out with a cookies cutter and save myself the swearing and aggravation that came with this cookie press"
1,Booooooring,"I had never heard of this author before and picked this book on cd up at the library. It moved at a snails pace, the book jacket made it sound like an inriuging mystery - but more time is spent on analyzing every last detail amongst the characters - finally when something does happen by the 8th cd - its anticlimactic. And althought he main character continually talks about being psychic - she never once has a premonition, other than feeling ""spiderwebs"" when she walks in a room. I couldn't wait for this book to end, and I will probably never pick up another book by this author, even though other reviewers say she writes good books. I kept wondering if it would be better, if someone who was not monotone was doing the reading on the cd. That didn't help matters."
1,What a Disappointment!!!,First off I have to say I'm a long time JAK fan and have ALL her books. I was quite disappointed in this book I was bored silly I really didn't care what happened to them. It's so bland!!!I can't say I liked Light in Shadows alot it was ok. I truly truly hated the eclipse bay series I really think she should not do trilogies or series I'm sorry but she's just no good at it.I actually was getting very disappointed in her books to the point where I considered not buying them any more then she seem to come back and I was enjoying her books again but the last 2 certainly is making me wonder. I am a VERY loyal reader and while I won't say I will completely stop buying her books yet I would certainly consider buying the hardcover books. I'm not sure if she will do another book on these characters I for one sure hope not?????
5,Fantastic!,This book was wonderful and I highly recommend it. It is a terrific follow up to LIGHT IN SHADOW. I can't wait for the next book in the Whispering Springs Series.
3,A Good Quick Read,"Truth or Dare is a good quick read--a pefect companion for a boring waiting room or plane ride. Jayne Ann Krentz picks up right where she left off in Light in Shadow. Zoe and Ethan Truax are still trying to see if their experimental marriage will work, all the while working on their respective careers as interior designer and private investigator. Zoe's friend Arcadia begins to ge the feeling she's being watched and the romantic thriller takes off. The pacing in this novel is a little off--the main conflict is resolved with about 50 pages left of the novel, and suddenly, there is another conflict that wasn't really hinted at earlier. That, though is my only complaint about this enjoyable read."
2,Truth or Dare,"In this sequel to Light in Shadow, we find Zoe and Ethan trying to settle into married life, but the fear of the other leaving has both of them holding their feelings back. Zoe's fellow escapee from the psychiatric hospital Arcadia Ames is also feeling out of sorts. She has also assumed a new name trying to escape the husband trying to kill her, and she feels someone is watching her. Zoe is still hiding her psychic abilities from Ethan. Ethan is still trying to deal with the death of his brother. Everyone is ill at ease.I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first one. I was hoping Ethan and Zoe would solidify their relationship, but they didn't. As long as Ethan doesn't believe Zoe is psychic, they can never be truly happy. I was hoping for some event or something to happen that would convince Ethan of her ability."
4,Entertaining,"This may not be JAK at her absolute best, but it is still a very nice sequel to Whispering Springs. There were enough good characterizations and plot turns to keep the reader engaged, and personally, I enjoyed it a lot. The best part about the book was a very accurate portrayal of how lack of direct communication and misunderstandings can affect relationships, and she illustrated this very well.Definitely recommended."
2,better books,"I know this is supposed to be intellectual fluff. The book equivilent of TV to be read when you don't want to be challenged, and I accept it as such. I don't know if she has just gotten complacent, ran our of time, or what?I have read several of her books under one of her other pseudonyms Jayne Castle, and I expect better writting and story development. If you like this type of book try reading Orchid, After Glow, or After Dark, published under that ""other"" name instead."
3,A spidery taint of something not quite right...,"Great second book. It's nice to see where a relationship goes after the romantic ending. This story had several layers of creepiness, suspicion, mistrust and outright doubt that the marriage would work. Even their dreams were forboding and held the spidery taint of something not quite right. I love the conversations about what it means to really be crazy and what it takes to accept the quirks of the one you love. Fun, slightly scary, and a little on the dark side, this book is a great second book in the series."
5,Great series,Received excellent Service. Ordered book on Friday and received it in the mail on Monday. Book was in very good condition. The seller did an excellent job. No hestitation to use his seller again. Very Pleased.
2,ANOTHER POTBOILER!,"Average is the word for this book. Like others I eagerly await the release of any new JAK, this one is disappointing. The characters are wooden, the speech stilted and the plot virtually non-existent. Why write this in the form of a trilogy at all? all of the content of this book would have made a good 2 chapters at the end of the previous one, thus finalizing the tale of Zoe and Ethan Truax and the other inhabitants of Whispering springs without the added expense of yet another pricey hardback. As far as I was concerned this was much too formulaic and totally without the finesse in her older books."
2,Boring...couldn't finish it.,"I reached page 150, and NOTHING HAD HAPPENED YET!!! Except for lots of pizza dinners between the characters. I had thought this book would be solely about Arcadia, whose story I thought was a logical sequel to Light in Shadow. Instead, it was an epilogue, with more blathering on and on about how Ethan and Zoe (surprise, surprise!) still haven't trusted each other enough to share their inner-most secrets after a whopping 6 weeks of marriage. This story actually underscores how little Ethan and Zoe have in common, which is typical of this author's heroes and heroines. Thank goodness I didn't buy this book--got it at the library."
3,Next time lose the drummer,"Generally a good amalgamation of early and modern instruments. Although there is nothing particularly virtuosic here, the instrumentalists -- both early and modern instrument players -- do a good job of making the presentation work. I would have given the recording four stars if it weren't for a drummer who was obviously clueless as to how to handle this kind of music on a modern drum set."
4,Works great,"The aroma comes out very strong, the only con I found is that the device gets really hot and I fear it burning the dc outlet so I plug it in for very short intervals."
4,car essential oil diffuser - great gift,"got this for my friend (especially for when she lets my dog ride around in her ride). she loves it. kinda prefer the ones that have a bottle you can add oil to, but i though this might be more simple for her. she can surely just add a few drops to the felt diffuser tabs - or buy more. she said she likes the scent and it quickly engulfed her whole SUV (tho it still smelled a lil like dog - oh well)"
4,These shoes will get you lots of compliments!,"These shoes were an ideal match for a slightly odd-colored skirt I have. The color has worked really well with a lot of my wardrobe. Even though the shoes are patent, the insides are lined with leather - that's really nice! However, I've worn these shoes twice and both times they've rubbed my toes - but not to the point of blisters thankfully. I'm a teacher and spend a LOT of time on my feet. The second wearing was less painful, so hopefully I'll be able to break them in. These shoes will get you lots of compliments! :)"
5,Great shoe,"Finally i found a shoe from kenneth cole that fits me on my true size, pretty and comfy, they lasted for year."
3,Cute but may self destruct,I was so excited to find these shoes online after I couldn't get the red pair in my size at the department stores. 9.5 a little small so I went with size 10 (a little too big) They are cute with everything...jeans and t-shirts or little black dresses. The ONLY downside to these shoes is that the color will peel around the bottom if you step through some gravel or uneven ground. I had to color it in with red Sharpie :( Walk and buy with caution!
2,dissapointed,"The product feature says ""patent"". Shouldn't that mean patent leather? But actually they are not leather at all. I ordered the red one. They look stiff and the color makes me uncomfortable too. Honestly, they are pretty comfortable shoes but make your feet look longer. I guess that's because of the style. Anyway, I am sending them back."
2,"Weird, disappointing story by outstanding illustrator and author team","Trina Schart Hyman is an amazing illustrator and our family has long enjoyed her work, particularly in George and the Dragon, as well as The Kitchen Knight. We also liked Hodges' retelling of these tales. Swan Lake is another book we enjoyed for Hyman's illustrations. However, this story is just plain strange and not appropriate for children, in my opinion. I gave it away soon after buying it. Stick with this team's strong works."
4,Thes Best cd for young people,I RECOMEND YOU THE MERCURIO'S CD BECAUSE YOU CAN IDENTIFY SOME MOMENTS OF THE YOU LIVE WITH HIS SONGS AND ENJOY HIS FELLING.
5,Excellent product and value,I bought this for my daughter for XMAS. She was thrilled with the quality and the practicality that it has its own case.
5,At Last! A Book for Teens in Stepfamilies,"I would highly recommend this book for teens (and pre-teens) and parents in stepfamilies, or those in the process of forming stepfamilies. The format of ""Stepliving"" makes it accessible for young readers. The authors approach the subject with an honesty and integrity that is rare in self-help books. It is realistic, helpful and full of useful tips and real-life, easy-to-relate to experiences. The experience of being a teen AND being in a new stepfamily is a challenge. This book will both reassure and assist teenagers in taking responsiblity for change and acceptance of their situation."
2,Seem to be alone on this one,"Looking at the other reviews, I seem to be the only one that was disappointed with this book. The content is too babyish in most of it for older tweens and the more ""grown up"" content would be over a younger tween's head. I had a quick read through and with every paged turned, I thought duh. I'll be looking around for another book shortly."
5,Good music!,"David Bailey's music came to me via word of mouth. I like all genres of music but mostly rock. Every once in a while my psyche needs a break from the loud beat and the harsh lyrics. David Bailey is the remedy. His voice is soothing, his words meaningful and the simple guitar is refreshing. A really good CD!"
3,Not durable,"My daughter, then age 1, received Chinese Ling for a gift, but the electronics began to malfunction less than a year later. I am very disappointed. It is a great idea though, and the phrases and tones are accurate. I would consider buying another, but it's a bit costly at $35 with no assurance that it would last."
3,"Very cute, but not dependable!","I actually have owned two of these dolls, both of which were the French-speaking ""Jolie"". They are adorable, fun, and a cute, motivating way to teach languages. As a French teacher, I was so excited to give this to my daughter. I was VERY disappointed when the first doll started to malfunction after about a week. I returned it by mail & received a new one, only to have it stop working after 2-3 months. I give up! My daughter still likes to hold & play with her, so I guess I'll just have to fill in the French vocabulary that our doll no longer offers!"
5,bright and shiny asian doll,"It has numerous phrases, from numbers to names to simple different greeting phrases. My 14 month old grandaughter loves it. I recommend it very highly"
3,Limited fun,"We teach mandarin to our daughter, and a mandarin speaking dolls are hard to find. This one is not bad, but the amount of phrases is very limited and I don't like that she translates everything into English."
2,"Well written, but deprecated.","I've had this book for about a week, and so far my experience has been that not a single example works out of the box with the current version of mapscript.The worse news, is that most of the documentation on the mapscript website is totally out of date as well.If revised, then this book would be great, but it isn't just the book.The are some incongruities between mapscript itself and the API libs in other languages that suggest that the current development environment for mapserver is sufficiently busted, to invite taking a hard look at much more complex map engines.In a nutshell, I went with mapserver, because it support GDAL, Perl, and appeared to be well documented.It isn't well documented, the Perl API isn't servicable in the current version, and I haven't tested GDAL yet.Good Luck"
2,Map server,"The version of the code sofware change very quickly... the book is old, but is full of content."
4,Excellent,Best guide I've seen on mapserver. Does a fine job of getting a new user going. Could use more trouble shooting.
4,Buy it - and read up in parallell on the Mapserver mailing list,"Beginning MapServer should not be your only source of information on using MapServer. The book has a lot of usefull examples in it, but I am missing something. My main interest is on how to use MapServer through PHP /MapScript. In particlar I would like to know more on the bindings from PHP/MapScript to the object model in MapServer.Do not expect the book to cover it all. It tries, but doesen't quite make it.Still - buy it! You need it for your library, I am sure you do ;-)"
1,slow pace + racist undertones= AWEFUL,"I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I was in this book after having read ""Lonesome Dove"". Unlike ""Lonesome Dove"", ""Moving On"" was very slow and had many racist undertones. Unfortunately, the underlying racism is not surprising given the time period in which McMurtry wrote the novel (mid '60s) - off colored remarks were made in reference to African Americans and remarks about ""stinky Mexicans"" were made. I found this to be offensive and that combined with its extremely slow pace eventually caused me to put to book down."
1,Don't buy kindle edition,"I have a paperback version which is excellent to look up. Meanwhile, in the kindle version, there are many words left blank with no description, such as amalgam, antecedent...etc. I hope Harper Corp. should update and correct the errors soon."
5,Fundamental ESL tool,"I have used the COBUILD dictionary since its first edition appeared. It marked a milestone in the production of dictionaries: now all publishinng houses are trying to build extensive language databases. However, the COBUILD dictionary has proved best of all, not only for the examples quoted but also for the definitions given. Only one weakness: they shouldn't have rejected so many words from the first edition."
4,cobuild dict.,I like the way the dictionary is laid out and also the many sentence example it gives. However I was disappointed that I did not receive the cd. What can I do about that than to purshase another book.
3,Disembodied oh yeah.,"Yo yo yo, the Disembodied side of this record is DOPE. The vocalist's voice is developing and he's beginning to sound a little like Brian from the all mighty Overcast. I really reccomend this record to all Disembodied fans. They also do a PHAT heavy tuned down Quicksand cover."
4,Great small loaf pan,"I bought this pan because it was the suggested size in Elana's Pantry gluten-free cookbook. It works well (only when well greased and prepared), easy to clean, and produces sharp/clean corners. Would have worked just as well using a pyrex glass bread pan though. Probably not worth the purchase unless you need this specific size or shape."
5,The shifting moods of film noir,"Ran Blake's wonderful new CD ""Duo en Noir"" presents a valuable addition to the his older recording ""Film Noir"". In his new release, Blake evokes the shifting moods of the characters in the Hitchcock,Preminger and other films of that era.Through his piano, Blake invests the same struggle that is felt by each character as they grapple between the good and evil in each movie's plot. The romantic atmosphere of the screen is brought to life with the help of Enrico Rava on trumpet whose ""Certi Angoli"" brings a Fellini magic to the set. The addition of Al Green's ""Let's Stay Together"" and Vincent Youman's ""Tea for Two"" bring elements of hope to the otherwise more mysterious puzzles that make up the film noir tradition."
1,Not so automatic trashcan,"Less than a year ago I bought the Touchless Automatic Trashcan and thought it was a great addition to my kitchen. Then this past week it started to grind and refused to open for me. There is only two of us in the house so it was not because of overtasking the machine. I am disappointed in the trashcan as I came to depend on it,only to have it let me down.I hesitate in sending for another due to its relative high cost and its lack of reliability."
2,Typical Gene Wilder Overacting.,"Between Gene Wilder's overacting (as usual) and Charles Grodin's grating self that he is, this movie keeps getting worse to me every time I see it. Kelley LeBrocke is hot...but even she can't save this awful movie. Gilda Radner was about the only interesting person in this film. Sorry she had to go so early."
3,Still Entertaining,"I have seen ""The Woman In Red"" back in the 80's, and I just bought the DVD recently when it came out. Watching it again did not seem as joyful as it did 15 years ago. Anyway, it was worth watching."
2,The Woman in Trouble,"This mildly amusing story is dragged down by an un-funny Gene - he just can't pull this one out with his usual ""dumb act."" This flick would be a big zero if it weren't for Kelli's looks (...)"
1,old wilder creates a monstrosity,"aaah, now this is a bad movie one can sink ones teeth into! possibly the nadir of gene wilders occasionally illustrious career, not to mention gilda radner, charles grodin, and joseph bologna (well, no -- he made ""blame it on rio""). i would say its also the nadir of kelly le brocks career, but its probably the acme as well, so ill be kind. if the movie is remembered at all today, its for that stevie wonder song that i cant remember the name of ..."
4,"Magical, Musical Mayhem......","LeBrock & Wilder, the most unlikely of couples are thrown together through a tram-re-launch advertising campaign, run by Wilder. Wilder with his spark of romance long extinguished through his 'very ordinary' marriage to Judith Ivey and his fashion sense lodged 10 years in the past embarks on a comedy of errors as he attempts to woo the sparkling LeBrock. The supporting cast are superb as a constant supply of fuel for Wilders amazing comedic skills. His observation of the male ego when it comes into contact with a beautiful woman is incisive and uncomfortably familiar. With an accompanying soundtrack by the legendary Stevie Wonder, this movie stands out as one of the unsung heroes of the eighties, the irony being that 'I just called to say I love you' was one of the most sung hits of the decade. A valued addition to any Video collection, which should be visited on regular basis."
5,Very Funny,"This is a very funny movie. Not only did Gene Wilder act in it, he directed it as well. I would say this has to be one of his best acting efforts. His own brand of comedy shines brightly in this movie. Kelly LeBrock is at her sexiest as well. All around a good time!"
4,Gene Wilder and his funny friends.,Gene Wilder and his friends get together for fun. Great show to watch. Enjoyed it a lot.
5,What a find!,"What a treat to find this book; and from a new author! I found the level of tension, sexual and otherwise, kept my attention from beginning to end. The hero and heroine are characters we care about and root for. Overall, the story is well plotted and well written.This author will be back time and time again, and so will her readers."
4,available for free,"This book certainly looks useful! given it's age, I went to books.google.com and put in the title. It's a free download from Google!"
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I suspected that this product would be a bit flaky with respect to its ""magnetic"" mounting method--but it fell short of even my lowest expectations. The magnet is quite weak. I should have known better. I will not be using it. It's hard for me to imagine it really working well for anyone who doesn't intend to glue it to the camera. Even if the lens doesn't fall off, it slides from side to side quite easily as well which will result in undesirable shot composition."
3,I dont remember buying this,I'm sure I bought this book for my MCSE that I never finished. I passed several of the tests using only books purchased from Amazon. The exams were difficult but the books must have been adequate preparation H.
1,Cab doesn't fit the frame.,I had several problems with this product. The cab never did fit the frame. I had to shorten the frame to allow the cab to fit. I also had to modify the mounting bracket so it could mount to the blower handle...Manufacturing Engineer...David...
1,Assembly Instructions Poor,"I do not usually leave a review on a product, but the assembly instructions on this cab are very poor. Plus, this cab kit came one bolt and nut short of what the directions called for. Lastly, although I did not completely assemble this item (because the directions were so poor) it did not appear to be universal either. I'll be spending a few more dollars for another cab."
4,A great book on the basics of Philosophy,"This is a great book on the basic concepts of Philosophyand covers everything from ancient Greek philosophyto Socrates, Plato, St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas,Jesus Christ Rene Descartes, Emerson, Wittgenstein,Sigmund Freud, and many other famous philosophers.It covers religion including but not limited to Judaism, Christianity,Islam, as well as the philosophy of science, naturalism, materialism,psychology, sociology, feminism, information theory, and new age conceptsas well.A good book but not as good as Sophie's World though it doescover more topics and their are only a few pics throughout thewhole book.I give it 4/5 stars.A good book for beginners."
3,Good only as an introduction,"If you know very little about philosophy or the main ideas of some philosophers, this book would be a great starting point, although I'm a little disappointed that Stevenson did not include Maslow or Ayn Rand in his discussion. Regarding the New Age section, I personally don't agree that New Age philosophy is the culmination or ""be all, end all"" of all philosophies, so I just read that section with a grain of salt. But if what you're looking for is a general introduction to philosophy, this book is a decent and worthwhile read."
1,Better to know nothing about philosophy than read this book.,"If you need a book that teaches you how to lie, and make excuses with philosophy, this is probably the one for you. All the 'wisdom at work' boxes in the book are nothing more than lies and excuses, and abuse of philosophical ideas. What's worst is that these 'wisdoms' are neither creative, nor funny. Only one who aspires to be a 'complete idiot' will benefit from this book."
1,Find something else,"I did not like this book at all. I would not even say buy it used and throw it away. The explanations are not clear, I found I could not learn anything about philosophy with it at all - which was the reason why I bought it."
3,"Good book, but...","The book was great, but the shipping was an issue. It came two days late and I needed it as soon as possible, at least I had no issues stalling but that really killed points for the review. Sorry, but three stars. :[ Book had no problems though! :]"
3,Kindle owners beware,"Note that despite implications to the contrary, the Kindle version will not be the same as the paperback version sold through Amazon. The paper version is Third Ed, 2005. The Kindle version is Second Ed, 2002."
4,Helpful for beginners,I love Philosophy and can't get enough of learning about it. This book is good for newbies to the subject and will give you an overall idea about many of the ideas of philosophy.
2,Good only for introduction,"This book is good only if you want a quick glimpse of what philosophy is. A start, and that is about all you will get from the book. And regarding some of the chapters about Chinese philosophy, you probably would learn better with other books."
1,Astrology is not philosophy.,"This book is certainly worthy of its title. It is a book by an English professor that completely dismisses everything in 20th Century Anglo-American philosophy in a single sentence in order to focus on post-modernism and New Age thought as the culmination of philosophy. Complete rubbish, worse even than the cartoon book ""Philosophy for Beginners"" (which at least gets right most of what it does say, but has the same blindness towards analytic philosophy as ""The Complete Idiot's Guide""). Get something else, like Joel Feinberg's ""Reason and Responsibility"", Robert Nozick's ""Philosophical Explanations"" or ""The Examined Life"", or Keith Lehrer's ""Philosophical Problems and Arguments"" (primary author James Cornman)."
4,"Very general, needs to focus less on ""new-age"".","This book was my introduction to philosophy. And, considering that I still read philosophy constantly, it must have done something right. The Complete Idiot's Guide to Philosophy does a good job of explaining multiple western and eastern philosophies, and is great for the beginner. However, the new-age philosophies detailed in the end chapters are too cultish for the likes of anyone seriously interested in the science."
3,Good Edition to the Fearless Collection,This is another great Fearless Jones book -- Mosley shows here once again he is capable of creating some of the best characters in crime fiction.
4,Good Story,"This was my first Mosley novel and I really did enjoy it. It was very suspenseful with some interesting characters and a tense plot. Mosley was very descriptive in giving an account of 1950's L.A. and how racism wasn't just an affliction that affected the South or the Midwest. My only gripe was that there were too many characters to account for. It seemed like there was a new character introduced to the book every other page and I had to stop on many occasions and flip back a few pages to remind myself who the characters were.Overall, I'd recommend it."
5,Fearless Jones and Paris Minton make an unbeatable team,"FEAR ITSELF allows you to get into the minds of Paris and Fearless. Paris repeatedly calls himself a coward, but his behavior belies that title. A man is not a hero because he has no fear. A man is a hero because he IS afraid, and he does the right thing anyway. I enjoyed the fact that both Paris and Fearless are fallible. That makes them more realistic to me. As the two follow clues to the fantastic conclusion of the tale, they both have to fight against impulses that tempt them to walk on the bad side.Excellent book, as usual, Mr. Mosley!"
2,Fear Not,It wasn't enjoyable as Brawly Brown. The story at first went really well. But it was case too many characters in the book which didn't fit in the storyline.After awhile I soon lost interested in the outcome of the book. While I enjoyed the character of Fearless Jones and Paris Minton. They weren't use well in this novel. Although I'm a huge Walter Mosley fan I was disappointed.
2,The mystery is convoluted; the writing is not his best.,"The problem, for me, is Paris Minton. In this, the second book in the series, he comes off as a whiney, frightened, and weak individual. I lost interest in the book (and the mystery) about half-way through. The character of Fearless Jones is one of those confident, self-assured, but marginalized main characters that appears as ""mean,"" ""threatening,"" and a ""killer"" when in fact he's gentle, kind, bright, and giving. I thought the mystery was convoluted and to be honest, it didn't make a lot of sense to me. I also had problems with the structure and execution of the story. For example, I didn't believe for a minute that Paris just ""happens"" to find that manuscript where and when he did. It seemed like a cheap plot device. That said, I did enjoy the passages from that manuscript. THAT would have made a better story.Perhaps I'm not that bright, but when it was over I kept asking myself: ""The point of this was...? I prefer the Easy Rawlins series."
1,A BIG FAT YAWN,"I HAVE BEEN DYING TO READ A WALTER MOSLEY BOOK, SO WHEN MY TURN CAME TO PICK A BOOK FOR MY BOOK CLUB I CHOSE THIS ONE. BIG MISTAKE, IT WAS MY FIRST TIME CHOOSING SUCH A STINKER. IT DID NOT HOLD ANYONE'S INTEREST. IT HAD NO EXCITMENT OR SUSPENSE. THE PLOT WAS PREDICTABLE. ONLY ONE PERSON LIKED THE BOOK AND SHE HAD ONLY HALF READ IT. ALL AGREED IT WAS DIFFCULT TO GET THRU."
3,Expanding the Franchaise?,"The plot of the Story very Chandler-esque with a bit of a James Ellroy hink. However, the heavy 'oppressed negro' theme got quite boring.Mosley is a one trick pony with characters. 'Fearless Jones' is 3/4th 'Mouse' and 1/4 'Easy' from the Easy Rawlin's series. Paris Minton is a riff on the 'Jackson Blue'(?), genius, cowardly, burglar who stole Jesus's savings character from Easy Rawlin's with a dash of Mosley himself.I think the author needs to decide, which series to go forward with. I vote for Easy Rawlin's and not more of the same in Fearless Jones."
1,Low Budget,"I purchased this DVD while I was vacationing in Europe. I was excited to watch it once I got home. I was dissapointed. It was very low budget. After watching the first 4 songs I skipped through to my favorite songs, but ended up turning it off. I have not watched it since. Maybe I could give it away, but I'm not that mean."
5,Great Shoe,Product is EXACTLY what I wanted and expected. I have purchased the same shoe several times and using Amazon is the only way to go.
5,Very Pleased Overall,"Purchased a pair of Bostonian's after many years of lower cost brands. Have to say the finish, the craftmanship, depth of color is what I would expect from them. Whatelse needs to be said !!!"
2,Poor quality and misrepresented,"The item arrived very quickly - I was impressed. First thing I noticed was that it was NOT a leather sole as advertised. While disappointing, it would suffice. Then the cheap construction showed as one of the tassels fell off while I was attending a meeting out of town. The suporting piece was a very thin vinyl that simply broke. I noticed the other one was pulling out of the tiny hole in which it was set. Well, since I had no idea when it chose to break, I did not have said tassel in my possession. The seller (Gabriel Shoes) informed me that Bostonian does not guarantee the tassels! I can see why since the design is so flawed. I ended up having to have both tassels replaced with 2 that I had taken off an old pair of shoes. Gabriel Shoes did offer and apply a credit of $15 for my expense. I will not purchase Bostonian again."
4,If The Shoe Fits...,"I order shoes online next to never, but having owned a pair of these shoes in black (same size and style) my expectations were good.I think everyone wants that ""Cinderella"" fit in a shoe, but in reality few are like that. Every brand of shoe is cut a little differently, and thus the real question is whether or not it gives in a way that doesn't cause discomfort. In my case, this shoe felt fine the first time I wore it which was for about 3 hours in church.I like it. The shine of the leather and the wingtip imprint make it a standout. The sole feels lighter than some of the classic dress shoes used to be, but in my book this is a good thing as it invites better shock absorbtion when you walk. Also noticeable is that the leather forms creases easier than older shoes used to, but some buyers will see them as character marks, while others view it as a shortcoming.All in all, I will probably invest in another pair (brown) when they become available in my size (11-1/2 W)."
2,noisy shoes,"I have owned Bostonian shoes for a number of years. Recently I purchased two pairs, one in Black and one in burgandy. The quality appears to be the same except that the shoes now has man made soles. This was not a big problem for me except that now the shoes squeak when I walk. I don't know if the problem is due to the fact that the soles are man made or that the shoes are now made in CHINA. These will be my last pair of Bostonians."
1,Torture,The worst dress shoe I have ever purchased. Painful. Inflexible and they do not break in at all. This is a classic model but the quality has severely fallen off over the years.
3,Casual but very Sharp Shoe,"I love my new Bostonians. I was however a bit dissapointed that they are actually an older version of the shoe (Evanston). These still have the 2 part interior sole. The newer version has a one piece sole that is much more comfortable and last much longer. If I had know that this pair was the older version prior to purchase, I may not have decided to buy them."
5,Super Comfort at a Bargain Price,"My first thought when I saw this deal was, ""I can deal with anything for $30."", but these shoes are extremely comfortable. I routinely slip my shoes off during the day and immediately after crossing the threshold upon returning home. I am able to keep these on all day and throughout the evening. I have to remind myself to take them off to let my feet breath."
1,The Worst Shoes I Have Ever Owned,"I wanted so badly to like these shoes. They look really good, come in 12 wide (which I needed) and the price was reasonable. However, these shoes hurt worse than any pair of shoes I have ever owned. They are the correct size and slip on fine, but the top of the shoe digs into the top of my foot when I walk. I assumed that I just needed to break them in, so for weeks I wore them, and even went for walks outside my office frequently hoping to loosen them up. I placed cardboard in my socks to reliever the pressure and even tried stretching them using wooden shoe stretchers. And they still hurt!I wear dress shoes every day and have had many different kinds of shoes over the years and all had their plusses and minuses. None were this uncomfortable. I strongly suggest you try them on somewhere to make sure that you like the fit prior to purchasing them online."
2,A step up from Country Grammar,"First off, I AM NOT A NELLY FAN! I do not think he can rhyme, nor does he rhyme over good beats. He is P. Diddy and Ja Rule with an accent. This is much better than his first album, but that was horrible as well. Nelly said something in his song #1; is there a such thing as real hip hop? No. Is there a such thing as good music? Yes, and this doesn't qualify as either. Buyer beware."
1,I'm Ashamed To Own This CD,"Wow. This album is just terrible. Nelly's first album wasn't bad but compared to this it looks like the greatest album of all time. Justin Timberlake is featured on this album. If you don't know who Justin Timberlake is he is from 'NSync. And he is on this so called hip-hop album. I'm sorry, but Nelly is garbage. I'd like to give this album a better review because when he released Country Grammar I was a fan of his but I just can't."
2,A decent POP CD,"...Nelly has sold out and is trying to make money and not music. Nelly has nothing important too say. Nelly wastes five minutes rapping about a pair of shoes. I would only recommend this CD for some of the beats, but I would pick this album up only if you had nothing else to buy."
1,Nelly???,"Man, what's wrong with the world today??? When I heard this record, I didn't know if I should have broken out into laughing or if I should have broken out into tears. Nelly's voice sounds like a really bad disease, I hope he will not have another CD release. He is God's best poser.I just hope you peepz keep your head clear and decide not to buy this CD. Man, you must GET money when you listen to this record coz it's not that good for yo ears. You could get an ear damage. If you r a real rap fan and r not just listening to top 40 crap, then don't buy this, listen to artists like Black Moon, GangStarr, Smif-N-Wessun, Big L (R.I.P.), Mobb Deep or others. But if you like listening to Britney Spears, Dido, Shania Twain or stuff like that, go ahead and buy Nelly, you will like it coz it's good pop music.That's it but why do I say that? If you r not just listening too hip hop but live for hip hop then you will know what's good and what's not.Peace, I'm out"
1,Abominable!!!,"This is ""slick playa"" style of music, and all 19 tracks are objectionable (profanity, vulgarity, and obscenity). That English has only a dozen words or that three or four of those words should be used disproportionately more than the others, and that thuggin' and druggin' really turns the ladies on is a really tired worldview. And it gets tired quickly. The overall quality is sonically high, but it is morally abominable, for the usual reasons."
1,That one star you see is really just a splattered bug,"Give this absolute garbage one star? Fat chance, Nelly-boy.This is a prime example of everything that is wrong with the music industry nowadays -- not to mention with society in general. That's really all that needs to be said.At least Nelly got one thing right: His ever-present facial bandage is a perfect metaphor for the type of so-called ""music"" of which he and so many other talentless goons are purveyors -- it is a festering wound that has yet to heal."
1,This is the worst album ever,"Two words describe this album, ""it ..."". Man the music on this album... , including Nelly's annoying voice and holla's. Again the radio just plays these embarassments to hip-hop and rap over and over and over again. maybe it's the radio to blame for my disgust of this album. if your'e looking for some good rap music go somewhere else because this isn't going to satisfy you."
5,nelly's best cd,this is by far the best nelly cd ive ever listened too. and if you like nelly's first album you will enjoy this one as well.
2,"Wow, it's just not that good..","OK, I'm not that old, but I know good hip hop. I can accept some pop/rap-pop if it has somewhat of an edge. This is just sad though. ""Hot in Herre"" is a pretty good dance song, but I don't know if I would call it rap by any means. ""Dillemna"" is kind of a guilty pleasure song, but it's not too bad. The skits are totally stupid and add nothing to this CD. I guess ""Air Force Ones"" is an OK song, but some people act like it's some revolutionary thing. I just don't see what's so great about it...I don't know. ""CG2"" is perhaps the stupidest piece of garbage I've ever heard. I mean seriously, I can just see Nelly sitting there thinking ""What's the easiest possible way to make a song.....REDO AN OLD ONE!!!"" Long story short, Country Grammar was a rap/pop album with an edge, so I could live with it. This isn't hardcore at all though. Just because you say the f-word every now and then doesn't make you hard, sorry."
1,*garbage*,"Nelly is a GIMMICK, if you're looking for a ""talented"" rapper my suggestion is Eminem, heck I give him 1 star because I can't give him less than that. He sells a million records, but then again so did Millie Vanillie and Rico Suave!"
3,Good Dance Songs,"Nellyville is the perfect CD for anyone who wants music that will get you on your feet and make you dance instantly. Nelly has had a lot of success with this album thanks to ""Hot in Herre,"" ""Dilemma,"" his duet with Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child, and ""Air Force Ones."" Other than the songs that were released as singles, the rest of the album is somewhat mediocre. But like I said, if you want to dance, this is the CD for you!"
4,Nelly's Best album yet!,"I usually prefer the Gangsta rap music, but i was surprized by this album. Most albums you buy have a only have few really good tunes on them, but this album hasn't got a bad tune ,they are all good. I originally bought this album for DILEMA, #1 and hot in herre. I recommend this album to anyone who likes the songs which i've mentioned above. This is by no doubt Nellys best album yet!"
5,STOP HATIN',"I think that this CD is a solid hit. In fact I think it should've done better than Country Grammar itself. I think the reason it didn't do as well as Country Grammar is because that was the first time any one ever heard Nelly. But now there are people all over, even from his home town, discouraging him. All because he has a style of his own, and a different way of saying things. Which really doesn't matter because he's staying true to his fans unlike some artists, and he's selling records unlike some very whack artists. But the main thing that I think bothers people is he did it on his own with his boys, who are all well recognized in my city, their home town. Name one rap group that came into the game and stayed as a group, NONE!!! So until you can find a good reason to belittle him, P.DIDDY, STOP HATIN'!!!"
3,This CD is Okay,"This CD is okay, I liked Country Grammar better. Nelly did a good job on the song Hot In Herre. I like it a lot! Also, I like the song with Kelly Rowland, Dilemma. It has a nice beat, and it is easy to sing along with. If you liked Country Grammar then I recommend this CD. Even if you weren't such a huge fan of Nelly's last CD I think you would like this CD. Some of the other songs on this CD are okay, but the best ones are Dilemma and Hot In Herre. If you are wondering why it is spelled that way it is because of his accent. If you buy this CD I hope you enjoy it."
2,WAAAAAAY too much attention for such a mediocre album,"Now I'm not gonna front--this isn't a horrible album. Songs like ""Pimp Juice"" and ""Air Force Ones"" continue Nelly's tradition of injecting some fun into the rap game--but the constant barrage of Nelly this and Nelly that on MTV and commercial radio just dilutes the likability of the rapper and his music. It wouldn't be fair to bring down the rating of this album because of what other people think about it, but when 13 year old girls and suburban kids think this is the coolest thing out, the album will not get much respect from true hip hop devotees. And Nelly will continue to cater to the audience that has made him a multiplatinum seller and a household name."
1,F.S.K,It is a horrible song. If I listen to the song more maybe I willlike It. some of the song are rude and discusting.It is wrong for the little kids to listen to it...
2,Only the hits are good,"This album is very disappointing. Only Hot in Herre and Number 1 are half-way near decent, the rest is garbage. Spend your money on Nas or Ludacris, not this clown"
1,Poser rap crap at it's worst.,"God, this CD is just terrible. Only buy it if you're a masachist and enjoy inflicting a great amount of pain on yourself. This guy has made me embarassed to even call myself a rap fan because he sucks so badly. Don't buy this."
3,Fair Fair Fair,"This album is fair at best. It is nowhere near the calibur of Country Grammar! You people that are giving this 5 stars are just blindly accepting whatever you're given, with no standards. The beats are boring and the choruses are mediocre. At least Nelly hasn't lost his lyrical skills.Highlights include:""Dem Boyz""""Pimp Juice""""On the Grind""""Dilemma""""Splurge""""#1""Lowlights include:EVERYTHING ELSE (especially ""Hot in Herre"")!"
1,How Wack can you get.....fools,"I can't even describe how corney this album is. It's pollution brainwashing your feeble minds. Plus most importantly, affecting our youth. It's junk like this gives Hip HOp a bad name and burying the true aspect. Ya'll better wake up. Get into the illness. Underground Hip Hop. It'll change your life. The realness will teach you to analyze True hip hop and Corney herbed out bling bling fake gangsta walking through hillbilly ghettos having egos with guns. Straight up geeks. For real. Wake up. Amazon got plenty of Undergound Hip Hop. My suggetstion, start with Wu-tang. Forget the beat and listen to their lyrics. Pure poetry. Mad skill comes within this huge klik.

1,RAp=Sh*t,"Damn , no ""0"" rating , Nelly and all those other rappers are untalented , ugly f*gs who don't know sh*t. This music is stupid, it has no meaning to it , maybe except the big ego's black people have today, and then little white boys follow along . Rap s*cks , you hip-hoppers are all m*ther f*cking f*ggots"
1,"No originality, no creaitivity...","This is why I don't listen to rap music much anymore... people like Ja Rule (whose first CD I still love), Jay-Z (Reasonable Doubt, In My Lifetime Vol. 1, Blueprint), and now THIS?!?!?!This is NOT rap music... Nelly isn't a rapper. He has the vocabulary of a 7 year old. I could have done this when I was 5... if you love party music, then please pick this up. If you want some real hip hop, go pick up Better Dayz, God's Son, or Quawlity. This is NOT rap music..."
1,Please don't call this hip-hop,"I wish Nelly would just go away. My only hope is that MC's coming up will not be persuaded by his sales (which I will admit are near the top) and turn into pop stars. His lyrics are unimaginative, his songs themes are flat stupid. The only thing about this album I will give credit to is the production. If only someone with more lyrical prowess could have used these beats instead of Nelly. I think he should join B2K, at least he would fit in with them."
1,This Cd is everything thats wrong with new rap,"Whoever is giving this commericial rapper 5 stars I can almost guarentee lives in the suburbs and has no taste in music. This cd belongs in the garbage, along with nelly. The day he came out and I heard people singing country grammar at my school I hated the guy. His absurd beats, his awful lyrical ability, and the commercial garbage that he puts on trl everyday is truly going to be the downfall of hip hop. Not only that but hes going multiplatinum with complete disgrace cds like this. Nelly, quit the rap game while your ahead. Anyone listening to this music should start listening to real hip hop, such as Pac, Biggie, and Nas."
1,He Calls Himself Rap?!?,"Does this guy actually call himself rap? He ain't rap. He's all pop. No offense to his fans, but anyone who can actually enjoy this, is crazy!"
1,Bubble gum rap,"Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out."
1,Overated,"Not good at all. Nelly is just further proof that hip hop is going down the tubes. Hi material is just not that good, to justify hid suscess and outside of few good, yet overplayed, songs there is nothing here that would make me buy the whole cd."
1,nelly sucks,NELLY THINKS HE CAN RAP BUT HE SUCKS HE JUST NEEDS TO STICK TO SOMETHIN LIKE PICKING UP TRASH ON THE SIDE OF A ROAD.
1,THIZ IZ NOT RAP...THIZ IZ POP,"People that listen to thiz fool rap are idiots...i dunno what kind of muzik thiz iz....but it soundz str8 up gayish...whatz wit tha band aid on hiz face....did he get dicksmacked?....Dont buy thiz crap on a disc from a singer that gotz aids...listen to 2pac, 3-6 mafia or tommy wright III muzik if you wanna hear some real good rap....If you disagree what i said...then your the type of person that need some friends and want to fit in...what a bunch of lamez nowadayz....rap iz dead in the year 2003...and all i hear iz muzik with that embarrassing beats that makez me laugh.......UNDAGROUND FO LIFE...YA DIG!!!"
2,rap is gone,"well ill rate this 2 stars because i did like it a bit wen i first go it...and hot in heerre was a club banger, but now i h8 this album soooo much its unbelieveable!!!!!and i swear down lisa left eye of TLC did that sticking things under ur eye waaaaay b4 bi--h a-s nelly!!!!!!"
1,What the heck??,"How is this album getting 4 stars from customers?? Nelly is garbage. Anyone who changes around the alphabet to have every word sounding like ""herrrre"", and wears a chain that says ""#1"" has to be a joke. Hot in Herre wouldnt of gotten any play if it wasn't for the Neptunes, ""Dillemma"" had the corniest beat and hook, and ""Arr Forrce Ones"" has the wackest lyrics and beats in it. Who does a song about a shoe?? Nelly is a peice of commercial MT... Even Jigga's new cd is better than this. I wanna rip that band-aid off his face and shove it ""u know where"". Later"
2,pure magic...,"because that's what Nelly makes it seem like when mostly everybody gets fooled into believing that he represents something new or something that's better than the average rap artist. How long can he keep this going because he sounds so predictable, annoying, and unoriginal when he keeps sounding virtually the same on all of his songs."
1,He actullie try to go against the master,"First let me talk about Nelly's""Nellyville"" Uhm its...Trash!!!!! Lmao!Its not even worth talking about at all. Now lets talk about Nelly going against Krs one ? He actullie thought about having a battle against krs one and to me thats f*ckin funny. Its like vannila ice tryin to go against nas on a battle. What a f*ckin joke!"
3,So / So....,"Nelly's latest CD ""NellyVille"" has some tracks I enjoy, for example ""Hot in Herre."" But Nelly's older CD's were much better, and I found myself flipping through more tracks on this CD. If you like Nelly, you might like ALL the songs on this CD, but I found myself uninsterested"
3,Overall good; but some sound-alikes.,"Nelly is one of the better rappers out now. This CD is full of feel-good/get-up-and-dance songs. His duets with Kelly Rowland and Justin Timberlake are hits waiting to happen. And *everyone* knows ""Hot in Herre"", the party anthem of the summer. Nelly's a good hit-maker - I gotta hand it to him, he knows what sells. Music without a care - music to make the people dance - music that doesn't try too hard. This CD is pretty good. My only complaint would be that a lot of Nelly's songs have IDENTICAL lyrical melodies. It gets kind of predictable after awhile. Overall, not a bad album at all. No matter what some other people may say: If you liked ""Country Grammar"", you WILL love ""Nellyville""."
1,This is just a pathetic follow up.,"Am I The only ones who actually liked nelly's first album, I Thought it had charm, style, grandier to me and kind of scale and kind of importance, you thought it mean something, but this is just a lame gimmick from the start, I Mean there are some moments and some good songs (including the sexy and very funny music video hot in herre with cedric the entertainer), but the rest are just horrible, there is nothing else about this album that I Can engage with nor cared about and who cares?Country Grammer was funny and good, this one's an utter disaster.One of the worst albums of the decade."
3,They Wonder...,"Many people wonder how Nelly became so famous. Was it his voice? Looks? Subject matter? The answer is, all three. Nelly is one of the most unique voices in hip hop today, and it has caused him to go platinum. Several times, actually. But of all his albums, Nellyville is definitely his best. With sporadic appearances by the St. Lunatics and several others, Nelly proves he can hold his own in an album. The best song on here is definitely ""Air Force Ones"", which has a catchy beat and an irresistable flow brought by the entire St. Lunatics crew. Even though the songs is all about shoes, it's still good. But really, I hate commercial rap. The only reason I listen to it is if the one spitting the rhymes has talent. Seriously, hip hop is going downhill."
3,good well maybe,"ok this album has about 4 5 good songs on it in my opinion but he didn't hit the public like he did wit counrty grammer. buy counrty grammar but don't really buy this unless u r a die hard nelly fan, i bought it liked it 4 a while but he needs 2 get back 2 his street not his pop."
4,Nelly hits a homer with this one...,"Nellyville is the one of the best hip-hop/rap albums out at the moment, and is quality from the first beat to the last.The standout tracks are the chart-toppers 'Hot in Herre' and '#1', as they are upbeat and lively with great rhyming by Nelly himself."
1,"Nelly, You're Dead","Come on people, Nelly isn't a rapper, I mean, his song is on a frickin ""Kidz Bop"" album man. If that isn't low, I don't know what is. When I first heard some of his singles, I thought they were ok, so I decided to borrow my friend's copy to see if I should buy it. Within the first hour I returned it saying, ""buy Outkast, Jay-Z, Eminem or 50cent, burn your ""Nellyville"" album, and never speak of it again."
4,Not as good as the first,This album is cool. I admit it takes sometime getting use to it. I had to listen to this cd a total of 3-4 times before it grew on me. This doesn't really have the STL feel that the first one had. The beats are kind of watered down. The only track when I first listen to this was dillema and no when i first heard hot in herre I was like what the heck is this but since it got pounded by repeated airplay and annoyin' friends I started to feel it a bit.
2,Nellyville - Mediocre Material,"After loving Country Grammar, and anticipating the release of Nellyville, I'm upset. I won't call the album terrible but I think Nelly could have done better. The hits ""Hot In Herre"" and ""#1"" are by far the standout tracks. The only songs I see being potential hits are ""Dilemma"" and maybe ""Splurge."" Nelly does get props by doing a few left turns and using some sung-rap tunes like ""The Gank."" One interesting fact, is the production of ""Dem Boyz"" in which Nelly says he knows those boys are coming cause he hears their hearts beating. Nelly better check his own heartbeat."
1,HORRIBLE,"This is one of the reasons why I'm scared to listen to the top 40 these days. So this is called ""talent"" today? Is it just me, or am I the only anti-Nelly left in the world? Oh no, a guy with a bandage and a thousand gold chains around his neck is going to attack us!! Oh, the horror, the horror! :( Yet, another rapper like the pitiable 50 Cent tries to make money by selling worthless singles and records. ""It's gettin hot in hhheeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrreeee, sooo take off aalll your clooothes..."" ""Can it get any worse?"" I said, little over a year ago. It's only getting started. Can we please go back to the days where rock and pop were the bomb? Even bubblegum pop, at least it's better than this. Will this nonsense ever end?"
5,Nellyville is great,This was great as a country grammer fan I loved his nellyville and can't wait for the next masterpiece
3,Joser,"""Hot in Herre"" is awesome; the rest of the CD is more rappy, much different than that classic dance number, but it is not as hardcore as other rap."
3,The MC Hammer of this generation,"Yeah, thats right. Nelly is basically the MC Hammer of this generation. He has no flow, he has no talent, but his music is still catchy, memorable and enjoyable. Its still a little sickening that he did a duet with Justin Timberlake on this album though, that probably lost all his street-cred if he even had any to begin with..."
1,Strictly GARBAGE!!!!!!,"I brought this C.D to a friend and really i'm gonna give it back!!!This sh*t is so corny and it's obvious that he made this crap called ""Nellyville"" only for the money (other wise he would talk a lil' more about his homies in prisons or in the hood.But no,no he talks about clubs,drinks and hoes,great!!!)Seriously what good to do whit this sh*t except to play it loud in the clubs and to get drunk and then to get H.I.V!Hip-Hop,at his beginin' and at his best,was supposed to be an art to scream to rage of million of blacks and mexicain(all the minoritys)in the ghettos.Then some duds like Nelly made Hip-Hop(the fake not the real)so damn corny.Don't buy this C.D,Please."
1,Brutality at its worst,"All that you need for a reason to not buy this album: its Nelly, hes an untalented gimmick who will hopefully stop trying to rap when his career ends, which will hopefully happen soon. It really deserves negative 5 stars, but since I can't do negative ratings, I have to give it a 1. 'Nuff said."
5,F.S.K review,"If you don't like Nelly you have to go to a mental hospital.My favorite songs are Dilemma,Hot in Here,and pimp juice."
3,NOT HIP HOP,"THIS ALBUM IS OK IF YOU LIKE R&B AND POP. IF YOU WANT REAL HIP HOP FLAVA, CHECK OUT THE ALBUM NATURAL BORN KILLA'S VOL.1 IT HAS ALL THE RAP YOU NEED INCLUDING NEW FLAVA FROM CORMEGA, TRAUM, NASHAWN AND HALF A MILL. IT'S WELL WORTH THE MONEY."
3,Average,"This cd isn't bad. It starts with the title track, a utopian image of a world ran by Nelly. Delima is a good song with a bangin beat. All of the songs with the Lunatics are good but I don't think Nelly avoided the sophmore jinx."
2,Hellyville,"This is the worst c.d. I have ever heard. Country Grammer... Country's better and I do NOT like country music at all. Nelly sounds like a kid that's just reaching puberty. Excuse me it's getting hot in here, cause I'm raging over wasting fifteen dollars on this ... I gave it a two cause I think the guest singers deserve something after being humiliated for singing on that c.d."
1,NELLY IS NOT FROM THE SOUTH!,"St. Louis is in the Midwest. Southern Rap is huge now and Nelly is trying to capitalize on it with a FAKE southern accent and calling himself a ""country boy."" He's just a fake pop rapper from St. Louis. I feel sorry for the people of St. Louis who have him representing there city. Real southern rap is: Haystak (Nashville, TN) Nappy Roots (Bowling Green, KY) Project Pat (Memphis, TN) UGK (Houston, TX) I suggest you try some of these and don't buy this midwest ""Nellyville"" garbage."
1,TOO KRUNK,"MANN, THIS CD RIGH CHERE GO HARD IN DA PAINT. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THA NU NELLYVILLE, U NEED TO COP IT, CUZ IT'S TOO KRUNK. MANN, DID I FORGET TA TELL YALL THAT NELLY IS PHYNE. ~VOK'AL~"
3,Country Grammer was better!,"Nellyville is a good pop album with some hip-hop flava. But if you are looking for another album like ""Country Grammer"" where every song is tight, you are looking in the worng place. My favorite tracks on Nellyville are: Nellyville, Hot In Herre , Air Force Ones, Dilemma and Roc The Mic-Remix. It's those songs which make it 3 stars. The rest of the album is flat out horrible. Dont even listen to CG2, it is a weak track which made me sick. The skits are just flat out stupid and boring.Dont get me worng... Nelly lights it up and can get a party going. But if you where to play this album from beginning to end it would make you want to throw it out the window on the freeway!!!!!"
5,Even my mom likes this album thats how good it is!,"This album rules my favorite songs are hot in herre, dillema, and air force ones.They are great songs so the ugly, retarted, and stupid music fan from brooklyn needs to stop hatin on Nelly cuz hes fine and talented but you arent so all i have to say to you is to shut yo mouth cuz you have to be WAY UGLY to talk about Nelly like that.Anyway this album is great you should definitley buy it.BUY IT!!"
3,What An Excellent POP album!,"Wow! I'm totally impressed with Nelly! First he does Country music and now he does Pop music! Wow! When is he gonna do real rap. I cop this album cuz I thought ""Hot In Herre"" and ""Dilemma"" was tight but now they grow off me and too many of the songs have the same beat flow as ""Hot In Herre"" which I must say is very Pop. This music is suppose to be Hip-Hop not Hit Pop! Come on Nelly your styles flowing down the drain!"
1,NELLYVILLE HORRIBLE...........,"The new so called rap cd by nelly titled ""Nellyville"" is probably going to be way up there....now u would think that it would be way up there with ludicris eminem and rappers but no Nellyville will be up there with N'SYNC......Backstreetboys..and all those pop bands like that....if u want rap do not get this cd it is the worst cd ever....country grammer was straight up rap..nellyville is straight up horrible pop....i hated this cd and i think u will 2"
2,WACKYVILLE,"Right- Okay I'm going to get to the point. Were does nelly get his fake southern accent from. ...I think he feels that St.Louis is the south, but that is another subject. On with that crappy c.d.-- Nelly has beef with KRS-ONE, KRS-ONE is garbage and so is nelly. They have nothing to prove. That battle is weak. Who cares about KRS-ONE he is a ""old rapper"". My stomach hurts everytime I hear hot in (herre) what's that spelling about. Nelly's skills are on a mc hammer level, personally I think hammer could win a battle aganist nelly. Yes nelly's c.d. is wack, but he didn't make it into make wack list."
2,skillz wasted,"pimp juice is a tight song that shows kid got some originality gettin loose, but you gotta be kidding me with this reproduced [stuff] that sounds like it is country gramar just coming back, see outkast killin it on atliens and aquemeni, breaking up the game not afraid or shy, slim got crazier on his 2nd LP, getting tighter on the sophmore release, but this dude takes no chances, just takes old songs and trys to enhancem, and then fkn loses all credibility with that timberlake geek on the track, call it wack this kid got no tact talking behind krss' back"
4,"Nelly Does It Again, Differently","Nellyville, a cd i have been anticipating for awhile is finally out. His last cd was non-stop head bopping action. Nellyville is done alittle differently, while there are plenty of fast beat, fun songs, there is some serious tracks to listen to, ""splurge"" talks about his new lifestyle that has come with his fame, and how people judge him by what they see. The cd overall is done very well, with a good balance of slower, serious lyric filled songs and dance, fast beat fun songs. The cd should be given a look if you just a fan of Nelly altogther, or like serious rap or some good dance rap. So go buy it"
3,It's Okay,well the album isnt as great as the first one i think he has changed his style a little even but the song air force ones is real crump its a hard song well it is worth buying my friend roni ron loves it like my friend ray ray does also peace bye the album
1,WOOP-This is great-WOOP just kidding like jason,"I cant halp saying how talented a musician Nelly is, he is such a great song writer and musical composer...what, im just kidding like jason,oh, unless you think this c.d. is good(remix of hot in herre)By now you must sure now that i was just joking and this c.d. is junk, all rap is the same, the guys talk about all this stupid *bling-bling* and having some tricked out ladies in the back of their fly cadillac.This music is so terrible no one will remeber this [person]. Rap is on a steady decline, nelly is leading the downfall, strait to hell. Listen to his lyrics, a 6 year old could write them, they are not the slightest bit intelligent. I could write and make a c.d. parallel to this one in about two or three hours, just write some bad lyrics and add a few bad beat and we are multi platinum.Rap is not music, this is crapppy, dont waste your *blinging* bills on 'dis fool. WOOOOP"
3,Doesnt meet Country Grammer,"I gave Nelly and the Tics a 5 last time cause the deserved it. This time around, it's harder to love them. Dont get me wrong ""hot in herre"" is a great club smash and air force 1s is good for a while but nellyville doesnt have the amount of killer songs that CGrammer had. ""pimp Juice"" and ""dilimma"" dont meet ""country grammer"" and ride wit me"". it isnt as good after a while. hopefully murphy lee's killer cd,""murphys law"" will keep fans hooked until the st louis group's next album"
2,I'm not into top 40...,"and this kinda music in general so I'm not a good one to ask. I know when I DJ it's a bit popular (or was a year ago). Its replay value (like most top forty) stinks. It's kinda catchy with the monotone chant style of rap and the production sounds like a zillion dollar studio with all the latest gadgets. If you're between the ages of 7 and 14 and think inner-city gangster violence and saying words having to do with sex (because you're just entering puberty and it's all new), then this is your album. Hey kids! It kinda outdated now though. Later"
2,One of the best...,"One of the best examples of why rap is not always hip-hop. The Dr. Seuss of Rap is back again with his Barney rhymes and soft lyrics. The beats are mostly cool, but I don't buy a CD for the instrumentals. The problem with Nelly is that he is trying to be tight. He constantly says stuff just so the teenie-boppers and moms can rap along. The catchy tunes keep playing over and over in my head. And why does he have to bring that wack crew of his. Murphy Lee is the only one who isn't awful (He acually is better than Nelly) and what is up with having someone in your group that doesn't rap, produce, or even looks cool (That dude with the mask). The worst is when he tries to rap hardcore. When I first started to type this I was going to try and sound funny, but why waste my time on a buster like this. No street cred having punk. This album is GARBAGE."
3,Bubblegum rap,"This is the kind of stuff that TRL exist for. Safe, poppy, with nothing real or substantial to say. The only good thing that artists like Nelly and albums like ""Nellyville"" will do is kill the tired cliche of gangsta rap. Sadly, the new demon they'd unleash on the world isn't so much better. But really, would you wanna hear another song detailing a gruesome murder, or a party song desribing a rapper's fly shoes, down to the heel? I thought so. A mindless distraction for the moment, but (hopefully) there'll come along a rapper who has something worthwhile to say without descending to cliches. Go El-P!"
4,nelly...still hot?,"nelly is a strong contender in the world of hip hop. his first album was an off the chart success. can he come out with another album just as hot? well he came close, cause not too many rappers can drop a hot second album after their super debut album. in this album, it features hit singles just like in his first album. standout tracks on this album are...#1, country grammar 2, roc the mic remix(with freeway and beanie sigel), on the grind, and nellyville. he has 2 tracks on his abum that made it to #1 on the 106 and park coundtown...Dilemma with kelly rowland of destiny's child, and hot in herre. this album is not as hot as his first one, but who cares, its still hot...i say cop this."
5,OFF THE HEEZY FO' SHEEZY! FO'SHO,"WHY YALL HATIN ON THE MAN?! I PERSONALLY THINK IS A VERY GOOD ALBUM I MEAN ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OUT RITE NOW! THIS ALBUM IS HOT!I MEAN WHEN U LISTEN 2 ALL THE TRACKS U JUST WANNA MOVE YO HEAD 2 THE BEAT!DILEMMA IS THE HOTTEST COLLABO EVER!THATS A HOT SONG AND PIMP JUICE,SPLURGE,ON THE GRIND,OH NELLY,AND NELLYVILLE ARE JUST THE HOTTEST TRACKS!U CERTAINLY WONT BE DISSAPIONTED BY BUYING THIS ALBUM ITS SO HOT!P.S.:ALLL U HATERS DONT HATE CONGRATULATE HIS SUCCES OK GET THAT STRAIGHT IIGHT!FO' SHO"
3,"Just an okay cd, October 5, 2002","I know this is a popular cd but it's just not my type of rap. I suggest you pick up Country Grammar instead. Nelly's voice changed and so did the fans. There was a reviewer who had a review about this who said rap is stupid. Sure, this cd is kind of stupid, there's a few good songs and that's it. Probaly when Nelly makes his next couple of albums he'll won't have any more fans. If you're looking for a kick a** rap album, I suggest you get Snoop Dogg's Death Row's Greatest Hits or Eminem's The Marshall Mathers."
4,Nelly = Over-Rated? Possibly? No.,"Well yes I think Hot In Herre is overrated but this is a great cd, and I think you should buy it!"
1,Best album of all time,"This album is the g.o.a.t it is 50 000 000 times better than illmatic, life after death, its dark and hell is hot, and all eyez on me which i thought had weak rymes and ... beats. catch this, the best line in hip-hop its getting hot in here/so take of all your cloths. the lovey pop-rap songs are just great. 6 stars."
4,Not as Good as C.G.,"First of all, Nelly haters need to let Nelly do his thing. He ain't bothering ya'll. I find this album not as good as country grammar. I know it's hard to top a first album that went 8x's platnium. Song I really love on Nellyville are ""Hot in Herre"", the song with Kelly (that is the best), ""Roc the Mic (remix)"", ""Pimp Juice"", and ""Country Grammar 2""."
5,dude this cd rocks,yo this cd absolutely rocks. since this cd has superb songs. and nelly's rapping is fantastic.
1,Sucka MC,"I didn't like nelly when I first heard him, but the neptunes made the first single off of this album sound pretty ok. I listened to (but thankfully did not buy) this on the strength of that song and heard nothing come close to it. It is artists like nelly who make rap seem like a passing fad and a lightweight genre. His lyrics are uninspired drivel that sounds like bad teenage poetry. The non-neptune tracks sound like britney-spears style bubblegum mixed with sub-par hip hop and sloppy flow. Avoid this at all costs, and if you ever see nelly, tell him to take that stupid bandage off his ugly face."
1,This is one town I won't soon be visiting.,"Another masterpiece by Nelly? Oh, rapture! Now we have another brain-dead pop anthem for preppies and school dances, just like ""Country Grammar"" or ""Kelsey Grammar"" or whatever that last audio train wreck by this guy was. WAKE UP! Don't even THINK about calling this guy tough, he has a Sesame Street bandage on his face, for God's sake! ""It's getting hott in heeeeerrrreeee, so take off all your clothes!"" In the infamous words of my neighbor Mike, HOW IS THAT A SONG?!?!? Oh yeah, I forgot, pay the record company, radio, and MTV enough and they'll play just about any old garbage. Oh well, fiddle dee dee, who cares about this anyway? I think I'll just go and listen to my Deftones albums now.. you know, REAL MUSIC?"
1,Dissapointment,"This was the most dissapointing album I have bought this year, maybe ever. I've loved all his previous single realses and was going to get Country Grammar but after getting this no way am I.Hot in herre is catchy yet the instrumental bores me. I love the Neptunes but this.. why?The only good track on the album is Work It.It bored me, I think he was trying to feel Old Skool but no way was that achieved only hymes of smart booty talking about his view of women."
1,Public Service Announcement,"If you purchase this album, you are wasting your money. If you don't already own ""Country Grammar"" and would like to hear some moron recycling nursery school singsong rhymes, by all means, buy that. But don't get this novelty album which tries to be a successful sophomore release. Alright, it probably will be but that's because people will listen to anything these days..."
1,Overrated,"This is my nomination for the most overrated CD of 2002. It's a terribly weak follow up to the fun, original, and different album that was Country Grammar. In the old CD, Nelly tried new things and experimented with bass in ways other rappers hadn't. He stood out from the crowd - but in his latest release, he seems to have sold out to produce a mediocre effort, which sounds exactly like the product of every other black guy with a microphone who's told he has ""talent"". I'm sorry Nelly, but your new CD just doesn't stack up to the original. Try again.1/5 stars"
1,Nelly is a joke.,"Excuse me, Nelly ""herre"" is spelled incorrectly. It is here. Also how shallow and stupid do you have to be to write about being number one? How illiterate and sexist do you have to be to write ""Hot in Herre""? How stupid are people to by and (dare I say) like this uter garbage?Nelly's Country Grammer in his little(or in rap talk lil) Nellyville may be hard to understand to smart people.Tonep.s. We should be able to give 0 stars."
1,this guy's such a pansy,"I guess the title for my review said it all. However I'll add a few more thoughts because I also want to comment on the state of 'music' today.First of all I'm not really a rap fan, but I do appreciate it sometimes. I like people like Mos Def and the Roots, among others. Jay Z and Snoop are cool, but they aren't my type. But this guy Nelly, together with a host of others, is the bottom of the barrel. He can't really rap, but that's not the point.The point is that his crap is being taken seriously. People think he's a real artist, that he's oh so hot-----just because he sang one song about it being 'hot in here'.But I do believe people are getting tired of him now----I haven't heard him mentioned for some time now, and I hope it will be that way for ever."
2,OK..Nelly Sold a lot of Records...,"Nelly can get a party going..there is no question about that...personally i'm a hip hop purest who listens for lyrical ability...this is found in mc like GZA, Common, Talib and Nas.....if you like radio rap..Nelly is king...if you like real hip hop....keep looking..."
2,True lyricism is dead in mainstream rap....,"I say rap because hip hop is about lyrics, nelly is too limited to be considered a great mcee, the only two things I give him credit for are his style and the production, other than that, he poses no threat to true lyricism. If he is still around in 10 years than I will respect him, until then, keep working at singin for people with the intellect of kindergardeners."
1,TOTALLY AWFUL,i could not listen to this whole cd.it was just too bad.i mean nelly did a collabo with that sheythead justin timberlake??! i give this commercial garbage 0 stars
5,Impressed Nelly fan!,"I love Nelly's new cd. There's a few songs that stand out likeHot In Herre,Dem Boyz,Oh Nelly,Splurge,Work It, Roc The Mic, and #1. I think Nelly put his best effort into this cd and that's why I give him 5 stars."
4,Black Music is Black Music and Its All Good......,"I love this album. Its the kind of record I need when I need tobang my head in the whip. Its what I need when Im working out in the gym or on cruise control on a Saturdy night. People have argued over and over about whats ""real"" Hip Hop. Black Music has always been about expressing our pain, triumphs, and fears as well as a hot sweaty grind on a Saturday night. Nelly is part of a tradition. Hes a aspect of Hip-Hop that deserves props for giving the folk what they want. Is he any different than Jigga? Or is that because Jigga is from the NYC it somehow makes him legit? I remember all the NYC heads who blasted Aquemini and took it back to the store screaming about what ""real"" hip hop is. Outkast has sold millon of records. I'll let you tell it. Nelly has done the same thing. The recipe of Hip Hop has been rewritten several times to satisfy a particular taste. I happen to like a little of everything. Women and Music."
3,It's aight,"This Cd was straight no where near classic standards. The beats on the cd are good they really are but it is the lyrics that are lacking. Nelly spits a lot of what I call nursery rhymes. The only thing that he did lyrical on this album is make the words rhyme. I liked Nellyville, Number One, Splurge, Air force ones that helped spark the sale of Air forces increase, of course dilemma which is one of the hottest tracks that has been released in recent years. If you like Nelly you should definitely buy this album, but if you are looking for a cd with some lyrical content go cop lil weezy or the young gunnaz they are the future of the roc"
2,poor england,I can not understand the english people putting up with these royals. They are sleazy humiliating and rotton acting people with little sense. No wonder so many english people came to america. How much of the book is true who really cares. It was fun reading a book where the royals got smashed but good
1,"Just Say ""no"".","To anyone with a serious interest in recent British history, absolutely avoid this book like the plague. The author lost me in the first chapter when she depicts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on their famous and important visit to Washington DC in June of 1939, as living a life of lavish abandon while their subjects suffered wartime privation at home.Too bad the war didn't start till September, Ms. Kelley!After this outright lie, written for no other reason than to blacken the characters involved and tell an ""interesting"" story, needless to say, it was impossible to take anything else the author had to say very seriously. This book is meant for the readers of ""the National Enquirer"", and anyone else to whom such trivial things as dates and correct chronology of events are not important. Is it any wonder that publication was banned in the United Kingdom and this rag is to be found on the twenty five cent reject shelf?Nuff said."
2,"Gossipy, and sometimes unbelievable!","Kitty Kelley's books are pretty much all the same--gossipy, tabloid-style writing--but they are fun to read. Some of the theories that she puts across in the book are so outlandish that you wonder if you're not *really* reading one of the tabloids! If you like reading about the Royal Family, and aren't too serious, you'll probably enjoy it. As for the authenticity of what she writes...well, I'll leave that for you to decide!"
4,The Windsors or Not,"This is s great gossip book sprinkled with truths about the royals. We the public will never really know what went on in the royal family but this is close enough. I was surprised about their lack of education but who needs it when you've got millions of dollars and a well respected name or royal name. The writing lacks a certain inspiring fervor but the juicy tidbits replace that. Aside from some inbreeding, a monster gene, alcoholism, infidelity, low intelligence, they are much like many families already on the planet.The Royals get the most fanfare in Great Britain but this could change too. I can't see them storming Buckingham Palace like the Bastille but it is a thought maybe around 2110. However for now it will give a lot of background on the recent royal family and why Prince Charles will never be King."
3,A Tabloidography,"This book is not a biography but a book-length tabloid of the House of Windsor. The Windsors may be all the negatives that Kitty Kelley reports them to be but people, even royals, are rarely without positive attributes. Tabloid writers aren't interested in the positives or in accuracy, and neither is Kitty Kelley. Ms. Kelley is neither a scholar nor a biographer. Her book is tabloid journalism--full of innuendo and mistakes. Still, one can say this book is a good overview of the worst there is to know about the Windsors. I'd only hope that readers of this book would go on to read other books for a more balanced, and possibly more accurate, view."
3,I didn&#65533;t expect this book to be so funny,"In order to give someone an idea of where this book fits in on the historically accurate scale I'd have to compare Kitty's book to the E! cable channel while the more seriously written and researched books about the Royals can compare to the A&E cable channel.This book is worth reading mainly because in certain parts it's humorous. I actually had a good laugh over some of the stuff Kitty reported, especially about Fergie and also Princess Margaret's reported obsession with porno movies!"
3,One of the saddest books I've read in a long time,"I have followed the goings-on of Diana and her death quite avidly. I found her beauty and sincerity compelling and charming, her works of mercy a worthy focus toward which to swing the paparrazzi lens. So I read The Royals with interest. It is a fast read, and even for a Diana watcher (but otherwise not to avid follower of the monarchy), most of it was new to me. I was incredibly saddened by the lack of feeling of the main character, the callousness with which affairs were undetaken, the lack of class and sophistication, and the way the institution was put so ahead of individuals. I hope it was not all true, but unlike some of the official reviewers I've read, the anecdotes seem plausible, and in general well researched. If anyone is searching for an overview of the last 2 1/2 generations of the Windsors, wants a relaxing read, and is ready to be depressed by the lack of royal character exibited by the main characters, I would recommend this book."
3,"Not a real bio, but still worth it","There are only a few things to say about this book, and they are that this is definitely not a real biography, but mostly sprinkled with gossip and tabloid-ish 'facts'. However, even though there's barely any real history, it's still a good read, and easy to get engrossed in."
3,MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING,"This is the kind of book you read in the summertime when you don't want something too deep or intricate. Just something to unwind with. It's a quick read, but the truth is, most of the information is not new. It's rehashed and restated, but nothing that would truly shock. We all know by now that the royals are not the warmest folks in the world. And don't we all have skeletons in our closets? It's not worth the amount of money one has to dish out to buy it. Borrow it from a friend next time you're heading to the beach."
3,The German heritage of the Royal Family,"The first part of this book is the most interesting, detailing the German heritage of the Royal family. One starts to feel sorry for the nomadic Prince Philip. No wonder they don't let the Brits read it - I'll be off to Marienburg Castle near Hannover to get the real story on Prince Philip's 4 sisters.The second half of the book is condensed tabloid material and much less interesting."
3,Seems like I read this somewhere before !!!!!,"For the hipe surrounding this book, I found that it did not live up to all the fuss. I have read almost all the books about Diana, Princess of Wales, and there was nothing new in this one. Most of the ""insider accounts"" were stories I had read before. If it 's release didn't coincide with Diana's death I do not think that so much attention would have been paid to it. Nothing against Ms. Kelley, who is a fine author, but I was disappointed to have purchased the book"
3,Not fact but fiction,If you've never read anything about the Windsors dont start with this book. It should not be called nonfiction but more like historical fiction. It is light and airy and an easy read but take it all with a grain of salt.
2,Crap--but compulsive,"Kelley's book is unadulterated crap, trash journalism of the lowest rank. She condemns Charles for being too aloof, Sarah for being too forward, the Queen Mother as ice in velvet, the Queen as velvet in ice. No movement of the House of Windsor, whatever it is, escapes her poison pen. Does no one please this truly disagreeable author? Still, I have to admit . . . I couldn't put the book down."
1,Forget this piece of worthless trash,"One of the more sensationalist inaccurate inflammatory and very likely libelous pieces of garbage it has ever been my misfortune to read.I *had* to read it, to give a decent review of it, (as part of my job) but for you whose pay cheque doesn't depend on it...Avoid like the plague.If you like works of pure fiction (which this certainly is) you'd be better off sticking with the National Enquirer or Weekly World News. They are more credible. And at least they tell you which planet Elvis is living on this week..."
1,"Terrible, stupid lies.","This is an awful, stupid book, that is not worth your time. It is full of lies and homophobic, racist, ant-English sentiment. I am ashamed to have purchased this. I will use it to start fires this fall."
1,"Rehashed, old material. Not much new here","Kitty Kelly has taken much of her information directly from ""Queen Elizabeth"" A Portrait of the Queen Mother, by Penelope Mortimer.She has also included much material from other publications that are too numerous to name!This is too bad, as I would really enjoy reading a in depth book on the House of Windsor"
4,I'm a baaaaaaaad boy,"Hey Liz, if you're reading this - I've read this! I wasn't stopped by customs, struck down by lightning, or anything. I know your secrets, Liz - and it has reinforced my determination to make the UK surrender to MY benelovent dictatorship. Nothing can stop me now!"
1,No wonder you can't buy this in England,"This book while big is full of lies and no wonder it isn't available in England because if it where the Queen would be all over it for the lies that it says about the royals.Here are just some of the things that Kitty Kelly says in the book that are not true1.The Queen Mum was illegitimate-she was the 8th of 9 children and her parents were married long before she was born2. The Queen Mum had to be impregnated by turkey baser to have Elizabeth and Margret3. Princess Margret was an anti-Semite because she walked out of Schindler's List4. Prince Harry is not Prince Charles' son- so not true. Harry's maternal grandfather had red hair and Princess Diana did not meet Harry's supposed father until he was already at least one year oldDo not bother even reading this book. There are much better, more accurate books out there about the royal family."
3,The Royals confirmed my beliefs:,"they are amoral, undereducated, ignorant, inbred buffons. It doesn't matter if this book is good or bad (it is so bad it's good), accurate or inaccurate (inaccurate). The fact that the royal family has enough clout to stop the sale of a blockbuster best seller in a supposedly free society is impressive. The stories in this book are so outrageous & funny they can't be true. Where did Ms Kelley get this stuff? Anyway the Royals felt threatened enough to stop it's sale in the UK. Reason enough I'd say to read it."
1,Much ado about very little,"This tome can only satisfy those who have been living under rocks. I'm glad I paid only $13 for it at a warehouse discounter -- but even that was too much. I must admit to having borrowed many books from the library about the ""royal"" soap opera in recent years, with the result that, for me, Kitty Kelley offered nothing new whatsoever. In fact, I wouldn't be totally surprised to hear sooner rather than later that she's being sued for plagiarism. Not only do I object to its lack of original material, but to its style and language. It reads like People Magazine, and one need only the vocabulary of a 12-year-old to comprehend it. For a really good read on that family, I would recommend a book published three to four years ago entitled, ""The Queen Was Not Amused."" It is a serious work of non-fiction, truly absorbing with much original material."
1,A mere rehash of tidbits from other books,"So who cares if the Queen Mum had A.I. seventy-some years ago? And, mind you, this is the most exciting thing Kelley has managed to dig up on the House of Windsor. And one should emphasize dug up--because the whole book smells like an old bone, well-gnawed upon and not very appetizing. Save your money! Don't buy. In fact, boycott as if just a tabloid paper between hard-covers"
1,Censure,"I am British and therefore have not read Ms Kelley's much talked of book. I cannot understand why we are not allowed to read it, but we ARE allowed to read the new book about Princess Diana, they haven't stopped that have they? I wonder why? Censuring us is only going to decrease public support and frankly the Royals need that more than ever. However, with Phillip in tow I suppose the Queen has enough on her plate trying to keep him from embarassing the monarchy.To any Americans who CAN read the offending book may I say enjoy it, if nothing else I hope it will entertain, accurate or not.And one final thought. Please don't believe everything you read especially about the royal family, and if you do please don't think they are a representation of us. We are much more interesting."
1,"There is nothing new, interesting or important in this book.","I just finished reading The Royals by Kitty Kelley. In view of the on-going media hype surrounding it, I am alarmed by how poorly written and researched this book was. I was led to believe that Kitty Kelley was a journalist who was writing a ""history"" of the House of Windsor. But this book is a waste of money and any time spent reading it would be wasted. Even if you are only interested in gossip, rumor and innuendo, there is nothing new here. Everything she has written was printed elsewhere. And to top it off, the publisher should be scolded for not proof-reading the text --- apparently if Kitty Kelley likes a particular sentence she'll use it over and over again throughout the book. Don't make the mistake I made by buying this book"
4,worth purchasing,"I know this book is filled with gossip, questionable resources, etc., but I still really enjoyed it. It is long - which I like, I hate to really get into a book and then it ends too quickly. I don't know, but it seems pretty realistic - just like real people act. It certainly puts no one on a pedestal; everyone is human. Its full of lots of interesting stories - some made me laugh out loud (the Queen and the King of Nigeria riding in the carriage). Anyway, a lot of book for the money; I recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading about royalty/history."
4,"Delicious gossip, served with a silver spoon.","The outraged royalists crying ""shame"" on Kitty should take a reality check- particularly the reviewer from Dublin who expressed such contempt for Miss Kelly. Is Princess Margaret to be defended after issuing such public statements as ""The Irish are all pigs?"" Yes, this book was a cold, hard slap in the face of the house of Windsor- and this reader has no sympathy. I felt that Miss Kelly's book showed the house of Windsor to be what it is- a crumbling institution that serves no purpose, except for the amusement of the tabloids. Miss Kelly presented a portrait of self serving parasites out of touch with their land and people, and she did it with skill. It was a fast paced, entertaining read, not always unsympathetic, but always fascinating. A revealing portrait of those who consider themselves our ""betters,"" but, sadly and obviously, are not."
5,Curse this book!,"I picked the darn thing up at 8 PM one night and couldn't put it down until 7AM the following morning!It ""reads like a tabloid""---well, D'UH!If you're looking for a serious, scholarly study on the House of Windsor, pass this little baby up. If you're looking for the dirt, the grim, the whispered secrets, and gossip galore, this book is for you.(Dormouse's word of advice: Just don't read it the night before a job interview...not good, not good at all.)"
2,Flightliners or Bird-pampers,"The flightliners are almost the same as women's ""Always"", so actually there is no need for them. If they would have been made in a different way, I believe they would be much more comfortable to use. Because using these liners the avion fashion suit still gets dirty, so..."
1,It Does A Good Job.......,"I got this program because I spend a lot of time traveling by car and I use it mostly for directions and it does an adequate job of that. (I haven't got lost yet!) I guess I could probably have used Mapquest or something similar, but it was handier to be able to do what I wanted without being on-line. I do agree with other reviews though that heavy duty stuff may be best left to something else.In short, this is an ok program."
3,A decent thriller,"In The Black Book inspector Rebus continues to be the dogged pursuer of murder cases, a questionable boss, and a tough (as in difficult) lover to his girlfriend. This time the murder has to do with the discovery of a dead body in a 5 year old blaze. Inevitably Rebus and his team resolve the case and tie many loose ends. Big Ger, the recurring nemesis, appears again and gets many a ""hit"" from the inspector.This is a decent thriller but the book was a bit difficult to follow due to the many characters involved. I had to keep flipping back to see who a particular character was. As is typical in Rankin's books the reader continues to learn about Scotland and its particular ways."
3,-,"Good, but in my opinion one of the weaker Rebus books. I found the ending a little contrived especially when Rebus confronts Nell."
5,The Black Book,"Ian Rankin has a great style of writing. His character, John Rebus, isdelightful in his approach to dective work. He is a stong character butlaid-back. He reminds be so much of ""Columbo"" of passed T.V. fame."
4,Rebus at his best here!,"If you have not read a John Rebus book, and if you like hard-hitting, fast-paced British mysteries, then you have a treat in store for you. I highly recommend Edinburgh's Dick Tracy (DI John Rebus). This is the fifth book in this series, and as always it's best to start at the beginning, but if you don't and start with this book that's OK too. Rebus has morphed by this book. He is a really strong character with the tenacity of a bloodhound when he's on the hunt. When a close colleague is mugged in an alley, Rebus is drawn into a case that began five years ago when a famous hotel burned to the ground. When the smoke cleared a body with a bullet hole in his head is found. The body has not been identified by the time Rebus gets on the case. With the help of his new DC Siobhan Clarke, they try to bring down a huge crime ring that has been terrorizing Edinburgh for ages. This is an intelligently written, hard-hitting, tightly written book that kept me turning pages."
4,The maturing Rankin.,"The fifth book in the Inspector Rebus series is the real start of the classic series. This is the novel where Ian Rankin matures into a seriously talented writer.Rebus is investigating the brutal bashing of his friend when he is drawn into a 5 year old mystery involving a fire at a hotel and a dead body.In the meantime, Rebus's home life is in disarray as his girlfriend kicks him out.The story is quite good, not as good as his later novels would be, but well on the way to becoming bestsellers."
4,Make sure you book a weekend to read this one,"Once again Ian Rankin has written a splendid mystery novel starring our favorite Edinburgh DI John Rebus. He drinks, he doesn't smoke, he drives, he gets hit by a car, he ends up back in his apartment which is masquerading as a college dorm and drop in, he gets hit on the head, he gets called on the carpet and suspended. But in the end he sets all things (well almost all) to right.Three loose ends are: What is going to be the final determination for Brian Holmes, is this the end of his relationship with Dr. Patience (and the beginning with a certain DC), and will he ever be able to shut-up, behave himself so that the Farmer can promote him.A great read, plan on finishing in two days, if you work hard at it."
3,not as good as I remembered first time around,"For ages I was looking for this film, but only recently found out the title. I first saw it 1980, and remember being impressed by it as a horror fan.Like a lot of things though, stuff you saw years ago as a teenager seem excellent at the time but when you see them as an adult you think ""what did I see in this film?"".The film itself isn't awful but it really shows it's age and didn't live up to my vague memories of it. The story is a bit silly and implausible, but the acting by the main character is good. I'd say it was an average 80's horror, worth a look if you can but don't spend too much."
2,"Nice looking, but 2 of 15 have died in 3 months","I bought the 15 pack from Costco earlier in the summer. As others have already mentioned, they are easy to install but aren't particularly sturdy. My big complaint is that 2 of the 15 have now stopped working. I tried replacing the batteries with store bought ones (about $7 for a pair or batteries) but that turned out to not be the issue. I'm going to contact Westinghouse about getting them replaced, but it's still a pain."
4,"Good, basic overview.","The list of modern histories of canon law is very short, especially in English; fortunately, this text swells that number. This work assumes the reader has little knowledge of canonical sources and spends, therefore, a bit more time explaining basic concepts than do some other studies. The matieral is reliable however, and it certainly merits a reading by those looking material on the history of canon law."
5,Great assortment!,"Excellent value, and recommend this if you are looking for variety. Also great as a starter pack for people new to sprouting, lets you try several different types at once."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","I can't stop listening to this album! I plan on buying it for all the music fans in my family. It reminds me of U2 and The Beatles. The melodies and the lyrics are both great! Plus, the band donates 50% of their profits to charities chosen by the buyers, which is awesome!"
1,No thanks,"Looked awesome but was watered down, spaded and given horrid controls to the point of no return. This sucks."
5,Must have for Joan Jett fans!,"This cool dvd is a must have for Joan Jett fans! It has the video's for songs like ''Bad reputation'', ''Do you wanna touch me?'', ''I love rockN' roll'' and ''I hate myself for lovin' you''. It had all the video's of Joan Jett I've been looking for! Get it today!"
3,"Cool collection on the pro side, technical issue on the bad","This is a pretty cool collection to have of Joan Jett on video, however it is marred by the fact whoever did the DVD programming of it didn't exactly create the menus in a universally functional manner. Be forewarned that the menus may function only partially or not at all on your DVD player. The first disc was unwatchable on my OPPO DV-980H because the menu didn't work at all and was only partially workable on my Philips 5 disc player, but navigatable enough to view the vidoes. There's no disclaimer about this limitation here; you won't find that unless you see it on the producer's website. The technical issues aside, if it works on your player or you are content to watch the DVDs on your PC, this is a great collection of videos to be enterained by. Joan Jett does seem pretty bored presenting each video in between though.cheers"
5,A treasure of a book!!!,This is a wonderful story that can be enjoyed by all. The author did a great job of getting me involved in Danny Coyle's life and to really care about him. I could not stop reading Danny's letters. I highly recommend this book.
5,"Mission:The Birth of California, the Death of a Nation","I was delighted to come across this incredible book by Margaret Wyman. Having taught fourth grade in California for ten years, I thought I had a good understanding of the relationship between the native Americans and the Spanish. This indredible story of a Kumeyaay Indian woman, took me to new heights of understanding, and stirred emotions in me from compassion and sadness for the natives, to rage and disgust of the Spanish. The author does an exceptional job of bringing her characters to life. I literally could not put the book down as I raced to learn the fate of these intriguing characters. Margaret Wyman writes with passion and ingenuity. I highly recommend this fine book."
4,"The Mission: The Birth of California, the Death of a Nation","Margaret Wyman has written a compelling story about early California and its invasion by Spain and the Catholic church. Surprising twists and turns are followed through the intertwining of the lives of the natives, the Spanish soldiers, the Mexicans, and the ""black robes"". Good and Evil, sanity and madness, religious fervor and native beliefs are all portrayed in this novel.I hope that her future titles will be as readable."
2,Self Indulgence,"I had to read this book for a college history class. I was impressed that these ancient diaries had been preserved and had been brought into the printing world. I was not impressed with the content. Pitti's diary did not tell me anything about Florence. He traveled too much because of his affinity with the French. He seemed to me like a conservative, wealthy extremist who wrote the diary for his own self indulgence. My understanding of Renaissance Florence is no sharper than before this book because the life of this man could not have been indicative of the rest of the population of Florence."
3,"So stupid, it's memorable!","I never saw the original, but this sequel is extremely fun. The campy acting and shinanigans just add to the laughs! The plot's pretty weak and very unbelievable, but Hui as King Kong is charismatic and pretty humorous. The two robot battle scenes are my favorites. The car and motorbike chase sequences are very well coregraphed. Not sure it's worth buying -- but definitely something to rent for a lot of laughs!"
2,Takes alot to feel somewhat soft,"We have a 250 gal. Spa, we noticed that after getting out our skin was itchy and dry feeling. We looked over the internet and found this product. After reading some reviews we decided to get it from Amazon, they seemed to have the best ""deal"". We put the recommended dose of 2 tablespoons in, we didn't feel any different. We put a little more each time until we were up to BIG handful. We are finally to where we can feel a difference but by putting that much in, we experienced a little foaming and an empty bottle rather quickly. With the over priced packaging of this item in a box twice it's size, the cost of the item and how much it takes to feel better, we've decided to look for something different."
5,One of the most aggressive lines against the sicilian,"I think that this book is highly reccomended to all players who don't like to simply win a chess game! The lines are analized with clearness taking advantage of what grandmaster practice has done with them. Lane chooses beautiful and instructive games for each line and he gives the strategic plans that are behind any possible continuations (all the notes are strictly connected to this feature). This is very important because this variation doesn't admit any misjudgments and so the moves must be carefully calculated, this is why it's most wiseable to me that you can understand the way you make that move instead of learning the move from a book. This book allows you to enter the secrets of the Fischer-Sozin without putting in your memory a lot of move orders without explanation. The only reason I didn't give 10 rating is that I wanted to see much more games than the 48 analized inside... But I can assure you this number is anyway worth of it!"
1,Shame on record label,"I am a big fan from Holland who buys everything from the Ozarks, but when i bought this rubbish I had to bring it back the next day, because it's not even bootleg-quality !! It's a shame that the Ozarks -legacy has been treated this way !! Potential buyers should stay away from this 'product' and enjoy ""Timewarp"" instead.Greetings from Holland,Martin"
1,BUYER BEWARE,The idea of an intimate concert with one of country-flavored rock's all-time greats sounds wonderful. The problem is that this must have been dug out of some old forgotten vault somewhere...the tape was running slow so the band sounds like it's on ether. I can't imagine anybody enjoying this. I don't blame the band - surely they didn't know. Someone should be ashamed.
1,Band deserved better,Jamie is right - for die hard fans only (which I am one). This is an awsome band and deserved better than this. It is a joke the way it is put together. Buy any of the other CDs you find at this site and you won't be disappointed. On a side note look at the reviews for a Head East cd put out by the same record company - same type of comments. Stay away from this so called record company.
4,Good!,"It is an excellent product! I really liked it. The only ""but"" I would add is the version of (I know) I'm losing you. It is a very short version and not the original long one included in the Ecology Album."
4,Safe T Gard,This is a very good product. It would be nice if there were sizes for those pitchers with longer arms. The one we have doesn't go over enough of the elbow because of the length of the arm. If it's one size fits all it need to take into account longer arm lengths.
4,Good but very technical,"I have taught one apologetics class from this book and am starting another.However, it is a very technical book and not for those who are not willing to do some very in depth study. There are some facts given or statements made which assume a level of education that most average people do not possess. Still a worthwhile book and should elicit your consideration."
5,"It is a successful story,in friendship and actions.","The story not only emphasis the violency and imgination, also the friendship, loyalty and justice. Of course, the beauties and action scenes are also reasons of its success."
5,Great Combination of African Music and The Blues,"I bought this album because I had heard of Taj Mahal and decided to try some of his music. Boy am I glad I did, though I've heard since then that this album is quite different since it contains so different a style of music, but it still has the down-home rough sounding voice of Taj Mahal that really pervades the entire album. This is a great album and very unique. Toumani Diabate adds a wonderful element of great african sounds and the blend of blues and african music is simply amazing. At first I wasn't very sure if it would work, but this has quickly become one of my favorite blues albums. I think the reason I love it so much is because it contains a great combination of emotional music and the two styles really do complement each other. I really have heard very little else like this that I could reccomend, but this album is a must have for anyone who likes Blues or likes African music."
3,"Talented musicians; ""New Age"" style","There is clearly a lot of musical talent on this CD, but it was not what I expected. In most of the songs, which are all lo-o-o-ng, the solo riffs are relatively few in number and are subordinated to a highly repetitive, even monotonous New Age style... this album would be more appropriate for the Wyndham Hill label... it put me to sleep, though in a pleasant way."
2,time for something new,"I have listened to taj ovewr the years.Lately he seems to be recycling his sound with new assortments of sidemen.How many more catfish blues can there be? Sure its cool to hear taj play with the current group but i kept feeling this was the same old taj with a new band......i didnt find this very intersting at all......i gave the cd to my son who said"" dad,how does taj get away with the same old things over and over again"""
4,Fantastic,"This has been a great net for practicing wristshots and slapshots out front of my house. The net is durable, easy to put together, and looks great! I recommend it to anyone who is just beginning to play hockey, and needs to practice off ice."
4,Good Product,"Easy to put together, lightweight and looks good. Not official size but still plenty large enough for the rec games. Hoping it will last as it can get cold in the MN winters."
4,Not for me,I should have read product description better. not a full sized net. better for younger kids. will need to buy a new net.
4,Decent goal,Bought for our 2 hockey playing boys for Christmas. The assembly directions were poor (referred to parts where the color was different than specified) - we were able to figure it out from the photo though.
1,Not for the serious player,This goal is good for kids but that's about it. I haven't had it for 24 hours and I've already obliterated the back post with dents and broken one of the top snaps. If you want something that can stand up to a hard slap shot and an actual roller puck you should keep looking. I'm not the best hockey player and doubt this goal is standing in a week.
3,Missing hardware,"Overall the hockey goal was great for the price- I purchased for me 9 year old nephew.My husband and I went to put it together for him and the hardware was missing to connect the frame.We had to go to the hardware store and find something to make it work.I did e-mail the seller about the issue, but never heard back.I would recommend this hockey goal, but order from a different seller!"
1,Don't Buy It!,"This CD is a definite thumbs down. The songs on the album are a good choice but I think that the artists should have payed attention to whether or not the songs worked with their voices. There were two or three songs that sounded okay, but I would definitely not buy it and I encourage everyone else to do the same."
2,Disappointing compared to their previous release,I couldn't wait to listen to this disc when I bought it. I absolutely loved their first release. The first cut is a live recording and was great! After that the rest of the CD is a huge letdown. For some reason Dr. Didg decided to add saxophone and try and be jazzy and hip-hoppy on this disc. It doesn't work. I wish that he would have stuck with the formula they used on their first disc... guitar drums and the didg!
5,Very Insightful,"I bought this book for my first year high school student who goes to a pretty competitive school. She read it over the summer and it was full of very good insights on how one commits new material to memory, why cramming doesn't work and many good tips for time management, notetaking, how to read a text book, etc. Although its a college study book, it is just as applicable for high school students in these times."
5,Big Band Arrangers Strut Their Stuff,"If you love big band jazz and/or Louis Bellson, get this CD.This recording features arrangements by the best in the big band business: Thad Jones, Bill Holman, Ernie Wilkins, Bob Florence, Tommy Newsom. It earns it's CD title ""Art of the Chart"" well.The dear departed Louis Bellson's great 1997 band features the best musicians: Conte Condoli, trumpet; George Bohanon, trombone; Pete Christlieb,tenor; Jack Nimitiz, sax; Chuck Berghofer, bass; and on and on.And the CD is offered at bargain basement prices, the last I looked. What's not to like."
4,Extra stuff!,"Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders are comedy geniuses. That said, this disc is not quite as good as ""Gentlemen Prefer..."" BUT there is a 30 minute bonus special of sketches that is better than the special on ""Gentlemen Prefer..."" It includes the hilarious 'Phantom Menace' take-off. These specials are not on the VHS versions, so if you have the tapes, you may want to buy these anyway. Or rent them. Whatever you want."
2,F&S At The Movies.,"When they are funny no one does it better. But when they aren't, well, I never even watched thru to the end."
4,Very Funny,"But is does tend to drag on. I love the humorous take offs of the American movies, but there are also reference to British shows I am unfamiliar with. I love Jennifer Saunders in AB FAB and missed Patsy so much. Worth the time to watch as Jennifer perfects her skills."
3,"O.K., but this is no AbFab","If you buy this tape expecting the in-your-face, razor sharp wit Saunders displayed in Absolutely Fabulous you will be very dissapointed. This is more dry, ironic 'British' type humor: clever but not FUNNY."
3,great.,"Nic Armstrong and the theives = The vocal talents of a Van Morrison and jack white love child; Music combining early Beatles, Animals and even a tad of early Captain Beefhart(FUZZbass & harmonica on broken Mouth Blues), all to make a great white boy bluesy Down home in the barn dancin 'round in yr overalls rock album."
1,Broke almost right away,My son used this lightly in our sandbox and it broke within a couple months. Wish it was much more durable. Bought a metal one off an online auction site.
3,A bit confusing.,The playing seems appropriate for the era but there is a picture of the artist with a piano on the cover and the sound is that of a harpsichord so it is a bit confusing.
5,Awesome PPV!,First of all I was at the event. I just watched the PPV on DvD and it is just as awesome as being there live. This is a must have for the Ultimate X match alone. Most of the matches were pretty good. The monster's ball match was great except for the fact that Abyss forgot to put shoulder up when he was supposed to kick out of Foley's pin. haha
3,3 1/2 Stars Actually...Good album,"Brian McKnight is a great singer and songwriter. I actually think this is a decent album, but not the best. There isn't anything really new or innovative, and I think that some of the songs are hits while other are ""non-hits"". I personally love his voice and even if some of the songs he is singing aren't up to par he still ""tears it up"" and that never changes about Brian Knight and it shows you how great a singer he truly is. My favorites are ""Back Seat (Gettin' Down)"" and ""Where Do We Go From Here"". Brian McKnight also gets my nod because he not only sings, but he plays piano and writes his own material and that is very admirable. 3 1/2 stars for Brian McKnight - ""U Turn""."
5,I think you still love her,"Recently my mom passed away, and I see my dad's face sad each morning. We are so fortunate to have the ones we love so close at hand yet we forget, or let unimportant things such as life get in the way. Brian McNight your music has been therapy to so many. Perhaps we can help you. If you love - then you can love again. If your sorry then win her back. I am sure this is not insummountable. Be good - and go get her back - you are a unit, unify."
3,"Meh, not the best of Mcknight","Most of the songs on this album sound too mainstream poppish R&B. In my opinion, there was also too much rap incorporated into some of the songs. Don't get me wrong, I still think it is a good cd, but if you want some of the smoother R&B, pick up Anytime and/or Superhero."
4,Worth the buy!!,"Okay, I'm not going to do a play by play of every song on the CD, but I must admit that Brian has outdone himself. I'm able to put the CD into the player and just let it go. Even if I am ""hyped"" up after the first song with Nelly (which happens to be pretty good) the rest of the CD puts me in a mello mood. I think this CD was worth the money spent!!!!"
4,Solid Album,"This album is questionable... I like the first track w/ Nelly. I was looking for more on the track w/ Joe, Carl Thomas, Tyrese and Tank... Eventhough there aren't alot of ""HITS"" on here, this album is consistent. It's full of good solid songs that you could listen to all day long!"
3,U TURN,WELL BRIAN YOU DID IT AGIAN. BY ME BEING A BIG FAN OF BRIAN MCKNIGHT I CAN TRULY SAY HEY HE DID IT AGAIN. THANK BRIAN ILOVE YOU
2,Did I miss something?,"The first time I listened to this Cd, I was not impressed. I guess I am going to have to relisten to it again. It just didn't do anything for me. I thought he just through some songs together in a moments notice. Maybe I should have borrowed someones Cd before I purchased mine."
3,Song with nelly,"I have only heard ""shoulda, woulda, coulda"" and ""all night long"" with nelly. They are classic McKnight. I am a big fan of nelly and his song is tight."
1,ahhhhh,"The refreshing voice of Brian Mcknight. What are you people thinking this the man who did a song with kobe bryant. Kobe bryant rapping I guess the neptunes will be producing a c.d. for Mc Hammer. Brian M can't sing. Sometimes I wish I was an owner of a label, I would spit in his face for trying to sing. I can't even write anymore because I just keep thinking about the track with kobe bryant. Kobe bryant rapping--I'm getting sick."
3,"Not enough ""BTO"" on this album....","I like and respect Randy Bachman, but this album was a little too much him and not enough the rest of the band. I missed Fred Turner's vocals, and I guess I got spoiled on BTO's basic overdriven type sound. This album is worth buying, and it has its moments, but overall its sort of like BTO with a prophylactic wrapped around it."
4,BTO FREEWAYS,"IN DEFENCE OF THE CD AND THE BAND YOU WOULD BE JUST A ""tad burnt out"" AFTER SO MANY GRUELING YEARS ON THE ROAD ! THE ENTIRE BAND POURED EVERY OUNCE OF THEIR CREATIVE EFFORT INTO EMBRACING A NEW DIRECTION TO REMAIN FRONTRUNNERS IN THE ""DOG EAT DOG"" WORLD OF ROCK ! I RATED THE CD AS FIRST RATE HAVING BEEN A LOYAL FAN SINCE ""DAY ONE"" ! I WISH THEY WERE STILL AROUND TODAY TO SHOW WHAT THE ""REAL SENSE"" OF ROCK IS ALL ABOUT !"
5,i thought it was one of their better albums 5/star,this is a hard album to find.i have been looking for along time.i always thought it was one oftheir betteralbums.iliked all of their albums but this one was different from others.iam going to see about getting it.
2,Not so great an album,"I expected better for the follow-up to Head-On. That album has some good stuff on it, but Freeways was a letdown. Randy experimented with a different sound, more mellow, less thunder, and the music suffered greatly. I continued purchasing albums from these guys, but my expectations were shattered. If you are a serious collector of BTO, then this album is a must. If you are looking for a sound to identify with the late 70's, this ain't it."
3,Good and not so good,"I learned some new information about Mr. Jefferson and would recommend this to customers with some reservation. The mispronouncing of Jefferson's home became livable after being irritating at first. The author fell in love with the word ""felicity"" but used it far too many times. Two of the disks had defects and skipped so many times I couldn't finish listening to them. I very much enjoyed the description of Mr. Jefferson's health problems snd explanation of 18th century treatments. Yes, I would recommend ""Jefferson's Secrets: Death and Desire at Montecello"" but with reservations."
2,Not up to the standards of good Egyptian Cotton,"I've had this item for a few years now. Despite the high thread count, it did not quite lived up to the standards of good Egyptian cotton that I know. Do not recommend it."
3,Very nice overall,"The sheets have held up nicely since I have purchased them about a year ago. The only thing that I have noticed is that the pillow cases seem to have shrunk a bit and do not cover my standard pillows as well.They are very soft sheets to sleep on though, I would buy another set."
1,Horrible,"I thought these sheets were going to be great - well, after the first washing, they would not fit on our king bed. I was EXTREMELY disappointed as we never were able to use them."
3,Great for the price,These sheets are good quality (not excellent). I purchased the king size for my king pillowtop mattress and had no problems with them fitting (even after washing). They have a slightly raised pattern that makes their texture somewhat coarse but it adds thickness and durability. I selected the light green but they are more like a light gray/blue so be aware the colors are not exact. These are good for the price just bear in mind they are not high quality.
1,Worst sheets ever,"I bought the king-size sheet set from Amazon. They are the worst sheets I ever bought. First, they came full of wrinkles and with many loose threads hanging off. Second, there was a burn mark in the flat sheet so it probably wasn't new. Third, the sheets look cheap. I returned it."
4,Nice and Soft,I bought three of these sets in different colors but have used only one till now. It is really soft and nice. I would say it is a good deal specially if on sale. Only issue (which is probably the case with all cotton sheets) is that it gets wrinkled pretty quickly and probably needs ironing if you are very particular.
2,"Wrinkles, Wrinkles, Wrinkles","I wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing these sheets! I don't mind a few wrinkles, but these sheets come out of the dryer with more than a few. I'm forced to iron the pillowcases and the top border of the flat sheet. They're also not nearly as soft as 420 count should be. I do NOT recommend these sheets, even for the price. In the future, I will stick with a well-known brand."
4,very good quality sheets,The sheets are great for the price. The color is as shown and the quality as expected! Definitely a bargain for the sale price I paid! Much cheaper than in the stores!
4,Nice !,The price and quality of these sheets are more than reasonable.We use them for our guest bedroom.Egyptian cotton is the closest thing to satin and make a very comfortable foundation.
3,Looks & Feels Nice,"Well the product would be perfect, but for some reason it does not fit my bed as it should, I have a pillow top Queen and it is being stretch to the limit for the fitted sheet. I would not purchase this if you have a pillow top, other than that the product is great. I just wish I would have knew it wasn't going to fit my pillow top i would have gotten a different brand"
4,Sheet Set,"I was impressed with the quality of the sheets. Plenty of depth for deep mattresses, secure seams with ample stretch for the fitted sheet. The extra set of pillow cases was a great bonus. A great bargin."
2,king-sized sheets not king-sized! Rough texture as well,"King-sized NOT king-sized, wouldn't fir on my standard king-sized bed. Also, high thread count doesn't = soft. Rougher texture than I want and picks up lint like crazy! Had to return them."
4,shrinkage could be a problem,"I like the quality of these sheets.Nice cotton, good price. They did shrink. I don`t have one of those thick mattesses, so they fit real well. I would not recomend them for thick mattesses."
2,Cross pattern sheets.,"These sheets are OK. Not really that silky, though. There's a cross pattern on them that's raised. I prefer them to be smooth."
1,Awful,There isn't much to like about these sheets. They wrinkle like crazy when you wash them and the stitching leaves a lot to be desired - hanging threads are all over the place. I would not recommend these sheets at all.
3,"Nice sheets, just a little scratchy!","These sheets are of a good quality. They fit my bed well, and I like the color. The only complaint about them is that they seem a little scratchy. I had ordered sheets before from Amazon that were very soft from the start, and thought that these sheets would be the same. Even after 3 washings they are still scratchy, but I am hoping that after more washings this will not be so noticeable. It could just be the slight raised texture of the sheets."
3,Major shrinkage & very wrinkled!,"I bought the sheets because I was impressed with the thread count, Egyptian cotton and price! However, after washing, I tried to put the fitted sheet on my mattress and it was simply TOO SMALL. I managed to make it fit, but it's always popping off and it's just a pain. I'm afraid I cannot recommend these sheets because the fitted sheet simply does not fit the bed size. Maybe I should buy the king sheet set for my Queen bed??? Also, they were VERY wrinkled after washing. I am far too lazy to actually iron sheets (who has time for that these days?!?) and it's sort of annoying to have super wrinkled sheets... but it's even more annoying ot have a fitted sheet that DOESN'T FIT! Other than those complaints, the sheets are nice."
3,scratchy sheets,"I bought this product because it seemed that it was a great value for everything and came with 4 pillow cases. The sheets are very scratchy even after several washings and were stated to fit up to a 14 inch matress. I have a double pillow top and they barely fit, it took a lot of work to get them over all four corners of the bed. Also, I find that the pillow cases are on the small side and the pillows are constantly being pushed out of them. The sheets are a great pattern, and they still are a great price, but I would not buy them again or recommed them to anyone. :("
1,Not worth $30.00,"These sheets wrinkled terribly after drying, faded and faded unevenly, the worst part were due to the patterned knit they were rough and had little tiny knots all over the surface. They were not worth the $30.00, but on a positive note they came with four pillow cases!"
1,Pike Street 420 Egyptian Cotton a dissappointment.,"I have purchased Pike Street brand sheets before and was satisfied. So much so, that I did not hesitate to purchase two of these sheet sets. Bad idea. I was very disappointed with the quality of these sheets. The fabric felt like sand paper. I washed one of the sets and they came out of the dryer extremely wrinkled. I have never ironed sheets but these would need be ironed before being used. I returned both sets."
1,Poor Quality Sheet Set,"When I received the set, I was very disappointed in the quality of the material. I put them on my bed and discovered a burn hole in the fitted sheet. The material was scratchy and I had to wash them and add Downy softner which did nothing to improve the quality. I won't buy any more."
3,The four pillow cases are cool,"The sheets come out of the dryer a little wrinkled and they don't fit as well as I would like. But for the price you pay, I would say it's a good value. And I really like getting four pillow cases."
1,worst set of sheets I ever bought,"The Pike Street sheets I bought at Amazon indicates to me that there isn't any quality control done by this company. Thay were definately not 420 count and they were the most wrinkled sheets I've ever bought. I have donated them to charity. Everything I bought from Amazon has been of poor quality and I have given all of it away. They buy junk, from CHINA and sell it to poor unspecting consumers at a sale price. I won't shop with Amazon again."
3,"My work for some, but was a waste of $ for me","Did not really work for my dog. One issue is that you need to ground this in real dirt. Out patio is cement so it did not work at all. I rewired it to make the fence the ground and this made it work, but my dog still jumped over the fence. I touched it to make sure it still worked and got a good jolt, but it didn't seem to phase my dog. We went back to the good old leashed dog run method."
3,I should have measured....,"The product is fine, but I wanted a ""normal sized"" one and this is a bit smaller."
1,Not for everyone; certainly not for me,"I bought this based on the glorious reviews. I will grant that the man can make a guitar do just about anything, BUT most of the music sounds more like noise than something I could actually listen to. I guess I'm just too old for this head-banging/grunge/rave 'music'.Had I known what type of music this really is I would never have bought this CD."
5,"This CD may have the version of ""Moments In Love"" you're looking for","For those of you that are looking for the version of ""Moments In Love,"" that begins with a piano and gradually builds like a ladder and ends with what I assume is a saxophone, you'll find that version on this CD. The version of ""Moments In Love,"" that I'm referring to was released in 1983. That particular version gives me chills everytime I hear it."
3,Art of Noise,Thanks for the album. It wasnt really what I expected. I was kind of disappointed but it was not your fault. I expected too much I think. Thanks again.
4,"The 1-2-3 rush of ""Beat Box,"" ""Moments in Love,"" and ""Close (To the Edit)"" make this CD worth the money alone!","The 1-2-3 rush of ""Beat Box,"" ""Moments in Love,"" and ""Close (To the Edit)"" make this CD worth the money alone...these 12"" remixes includes ridiculous samples not to mention special guests like Duane Eddy playing guitar on ""Peter Gunn"", Max Headroom doing his thing on ""Paranoimia"" and Tom Jones golden throat on the Prince tune ""Kiss""."
1,Buyers: A true ripoff,"BUYERS BEWARE: Do not, repeat, do not spend your money on this R rated version of the movie, or you'll miss the whole point. It's like eating a cone without ice cream. Try the unrated version, also on sale in Amazon."
1,THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL!,"BUYERS BEWARE as a previous review stated. This IS NOT the original version of this movie. Large sections have been removed. And when viewing, you can be confounded as to ""what just happened?"" or left wondering WHY(?). Anyway, the many things that made the original amazing have been deleted from this versison. BEST TO JUST AVOID."
4,"Enjoyable, if slightly shallow, melodrama","Entertaining, sexy melodrama set in Franco's Spain, based on a true story.A young solider is torn between his virginal, virtuous hard working fiancée,and his hot-blooded, small time criminal landlady, with whom he has atempestuous affair, leading to betrayals and ultimately murder.Well acted, and never dull, but also never seems to go very deep into the characters, withsudden changes in alliance and attitude occurring without much explanation, or toofast to be believed. Consequentially, it's never very emotional, even if the story istragic. It all has a slightly over-the top, operatic feel. A movie I enjoyed, but doubtI'd have the inclination to see again."
3,A little long...,"I ordered these on sale through amazon, and they arrived quickly and well-packed to my door. They coordinate beautifully with the rest of my Talisman set. Why 3 stars? Because, although they are standard size pillowcases, they are LONG, a good 2 inches or so too long, so that beautiful green strip with the embroidered dragons is too far to the edge to show properly. Other than that, great product. I would still have ordered this, just a little disappointed that the same attention to detail wasn't shown on something as basic as length."
2,Ways to go,"2 1/2You could hear elements of greatness re-shuffling around, but Home catches more mild transitioning than anything with staying power compared to their finest work."
1,one star for Amazon,"Home is one of Procol Harum's best but my complaint is with Amazon - first of all, is this CD actually available and second of all, where's the track listing - what are the bonus tracks? I find this to be very suspicious..."
2,Wrong Color,The seller sent me a flag that is navy blue in color. Obviously if you look at the picture it is a more royal blue color. I also odered another flag that looked navy blue. So now I have two flags that are the same color. The seller did nothing to correct this for me. Obviously I dont need two of the same flag. I really did want the lighter blue as pictured. I won't be ordering from this seller again.
3,French Psychobilly,"Psychobilly from France. The songs are catchy enough and the vox decent, but the music is muddled. The guitars are tuned down almost to doom rock lows and the drums use way too much crash cymbal. Obviously they want to play heavy, but they sacrifice the fun and campiness you expect from psychobilly."
3,Has many ball touch exercises that require little space.,"The ball handling exercises on the front of the tape remind me of basketball exercises, but may be good for goalkeepers. The ball touch exercises on the rest of the tape can be done in a small area in front of the TV."
3,easy light work out,I felt this was to easy and did not hold stretches long enough it might be good for someone with no experience in Pilates but I did Pilates with my 1st pregnancy and got better deeper stretches than I got with this video.
5,The Best Available Freeway Guide,"I have traveled using the Road Atlas almost every where in the US and the Atlas has turned out to be a perfect guide. It shows all the major Interstates, US Highways and a lot more. The discount coupons at the back also help a lot.In comparisn with the National Geographic Road Atlas, this Atlas comes on top because of the clarity of maps and the quality of paper. A definite 5 Star Purchase."
4,Old 97's at it again!,Just when you thought they couldn't do it again they did! This is yet another awesome example of the versitality and catchy tunes from the boys. Their songs make you think and laugh. When I'm feeling down I just pop a CD in and they brighten up my day. This album is great and I recomemd it to all true Old 97's fans!
2,Some rare gems.,"Not a good place to start listening to this amazing band, but a must-have for the completists."
2,Cute pictures but terribly written story,"The story ""Finding Nemo"" is a nice kid's story, but this book does a very lousy job telling it. It doesn't flow well at all and is just poorly written (or edited?). I definitely would not recommend this book."
1,A let down,Sotry of Nemo and Marlin does not flow well. Takes random bits and pieces from the movie (and not necessarily the best/funniest) without hitting the main highlights. Pictures are pretty cute and my toddler son likes it... I just wish the story matched the wonderful movie more closely.
5,finding nemo little golden book,this little golden book of finding nemo is so cute . if you like finding nemo dvd this is a great buy
1,Disappointed!,"Someone drew all the pictures instead of taking frames from the movie. The story also didn't flow as well as the movie. They should have done better. We bought this after liking the Monsters, Inc board book. But this is a total disappointment. 0 star if there is a choice."
1,Poor quality,"Drawings are look more like an inexpensive comic book than a master drawing's book, I am very disappointed with this book."
2,More gripes than likes!,"I bought this lens to be my wider angle lens (I have a 50mm 1.8, and a 70-300 telephoto). While this lens works pretty well at 28mm, zooming always gives a distorted image. I primarily use this lens for weddings since the 28mm helps with tight bridal rooms and smaller spaces you find in churches, etc. But sometimes you need the zoom capability and this lens does a terrible job with anything more than 28mm. So basically, if this were a prime fixed lens, I'd be a hundred percent happy with it--it's sharp and fast at 28mm. But because it has an unusable zoom function (in my opinion) it falls flat."
5,Pretty Decent Lens,"First of all, you are looking at a low end lens. Don't expect to get the same results you would get from a $1000+ lens because it's not going to happen.I've had this lens for a couple of weeks and I'm pretty happy with the images I got from it. I bought this lens as a secondary lens. I use it mostly for family pics, or non-job related shootings.Personally, I think that for the price you can't beat it. It's a pretty decent lens. You may want to check some of the images that I uploaded here (product images).Bottom line. If you have big money to expend on an expensive lens, then go for it. But if you are looking for an affordable lens, this could be it."
4,Good starter lens,"Decided to buy this lens after purchasing a [body only] Canon Rebel XTi. Comparing this with the Canon kit lens will reveal insignificant differences. Both decent lenses for basic still photos, but it really shoots as a 45mm-112mm lens because of the XTi's 1.6x field of view crop factor. Next step is an upgrade to a wider view Sigma 18-200mm lens [[ASIN: B000NOSCGM]]. I've seen photos with this lens that are stunning. Canon lenses are excellent, IMO, but they tend to be overpriced for the minimum quality trade-off with third party lenses like Sigma or Tamron."
4,Massage lotion review,Overall great product. I would recommend using lotion first if your skin is dry. It doesn't absorb well. It does have a nice scent and flavor.
4,Ubu Does Pop - in their own quirky style,"I'm not really a fan, so I haven't heard all of their stuff, but I suspect this is their most accessible album. These are fun songs, some are pretty catchy. Dave Thomas' vocals are high-pitched, wild and warbling (as usual). If you like the wacky style of early Talking Heads, there's a good chance you'll dig this album."
4,"Classic Trance Anthems, can't go wrong.","I got this even though I was familiar with about 90% of the songs on the disc. If you're looking for a Euro progressive trance compilation, you can't go wrong with this one. From The Orange Theme, to Out of the Blue, Cream, 9PM, Happiness Happening - if you're into the scene, all these have been spun by the top bill DJ's. It's no longer ""fresh"" music, but rather many of the memorable tracks we'll remember for a long time. If you've got a big collection, you probably already have these on other CD's, but if you're new to trance, this is a good buy. Check out George Acosta, DJ Micro, Armin Van Buuren, Paul Van Dyk, etc for even better mixes. 4.5 stars. For a compilation, its one of the better ones out there."
4,Religious Insight,"Rev. Samuel M. Shoemaker is the pastor of the Calvary which is a church located in New York. Shoemaker has touched a lot of people lives including peers in the same profession. Shoemaker counsels his congregation members and he's ask a lot of questions about life. This book is like a manual to some of the question that people have about life. This a very interesting book because Shoemaker gives his take on society, the Church, and the people."
4,Nothing New,"There is nothing new under the sun. The core things that we struggle with today have been struggled with since the creation of man. Sure, it may get repackaged under new names (postmodernism is really the new existentialism), but it is the same thing.And I believe this book is proof of that. What Shoemaker outlines (again thanks to Palmieri) is human nature. The Conversion of the Church should be just as useful to people today as it was when it was originally published."
4,eye opener,"This book was not what I was expecting, but in a good way. It is very interesting book which gave me a new perspective on important aspects concerning the church. As a person who struggles with their faith I thought this was a great book which didn't make me feel lesser because my faith was not strong, instead it inspired me. I have also been ignorant of different religions, dominations, and churches and this book really opened my eyes. I have found that I do want a new way for churches...my personal way would be for church to serve coffee on couches and it would keep me more interested. However I have found this book very informative and it leaves me wanting more information."
3,A nice how to manual for church change,"This book will give you a sharp kick if you are working in an inactive or ineffective church and challenges some of our accepted church people practices. It is hard to read and a lot of information in a small space however it is worth studying. If you are interested in making changes or if you need a wake up call to change, this is the manual to get you started."
5,A thought provoking spiritual book,"""The Conversion of the Church: The Genius of Fellowship"" by Samuel M. Shoemaker is a book that makes you stop and rethink the concept of religion and fellowship. The idea of transforming parish houses and churches into quiet places of serenity focusing truly on people and fellowship, is an idea I would love to see come to fruition. Reverend Shoemaker puts forth fundamental issues, ideas and principals giving the Church the responsibility to be more Christlike, showing more dedication to the fellowship of man. ""The Conversion of the Church: The Genius of Fellowship"" also calls for the Church to be less judgmental and show more compassion and love to all. With blank pages interspersed throughout the book, giving readers the opportunity to jot down their own thoughts, reactions and favorite passages.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a spiritual book that will make you stop and rethink basic issues."
4,Conversion of Church: Genius of Fellowship,"This book provides sound usable advice to pastors and church leaders. Although it is at times difficult to read, it is worth the effort. The author discusses the failings of present day churches and provides realistic advice on how to revive the leadership and the congregation. He carefully goes through objections and obstacles to the advice he offers. This advice is highlighted with specific stories of instances where his suggestions have and are working. This is a must read for religious leaders seeking to light a fire in their ministry."
1,WHAT A MISTAKE!!!!,"THE FILM YOU ARE ORDERING HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ROLLER DERBY, THE 1970'S, OR A NUDE CLAUDIA JENNINGS. THIS IS A CARTOON FOR CHILDREN. THE NAME OF THIS FILM IS THE SAME AS A VERSION OF ""HOLY ROLLERS"" BUT IT IS NOT ""HOLY ROLLERS"". THIS IS NOT WHAT IT SAYS IT IS. UNLESS YOU WANT A CUTE CARTOON ABOUT DOGS, DON'T ORDER THIS FILM."
4,Gone too soon...,"Dang, too often it takes tragedy in the entertainment field to uncover a lesser-known, diamond-in-the-rough type singer. I've become even more acquainted with Susannah's voice since her death just days ago (5/18/01). Oh, the dozens of Concord compilations which feature her voice never caught my attention (and are surely worth another listen), but this Gershwin disc sure did. Very sedating and relaxing songs with exceptional backing are represented here. I'll definitely plan to broaden my reviews once I've had a chance to garner future discs by Susannah. Surely she's enjoying her stay with Sarah, Carmen, and Ella!!"
5,Captain America dvd-rom,"I love these comic dvd-roms! As a kid, I collected comics. I took a 10 year break and these collections brought me back. It's a cheap way to read your favorite titles. My only wish is that they continue to make more titles available. Make Mine Marvel!"
2,Product cover damage,"Although purchased item was delivered earlier than estimated, the product arrived with damage. Art cover was broken and squash down because Seller was not capable to pack the item in a box but rather shipped it in an envelop. Very disappointing - especially since this product could be rated as soon to be rare! Comic is great!"
4,im not sure this needed to come with tales of suspense.,"tales of suspense 39-99 where already included in the iron man, so putting in issues 59-99 wasn't very necessary. Anyway, this comes with cap 100-454, v2 1-13, v3 1-50, v4 1-32, and v5 1-12 pretty cool set go ahead and buy it if your a cap fan. The only thing I wish this came with is CAC 1-78 from back in the 40s"
2,Sorry but Not Mad. Still love Amazon.,"After more than two weeks,this book was determined, by the seller, to be ""lost in the mail."" Amazon.com returned my payment promptly. I bought the book elsewhere. Unfortunately, ""Selected Melanie Klein"" is a disappointment; Klein writes in psychoanalytical jargon only. I prefer reading Sigmund Freud's pellucid prose. PLEASE NOTE:I've ordered from Amazon.com before and have NEVER had any problem receiving items ordered. I'll continue to order from Amazon.com. barbara"
5,The best rap album ever,"O.K. Let me put this in prespective to you. I am guy who tends to like more art orientated bands and indie like: Sonic youth, The Velvet Underground, Modest Mouse, ect. But this is an awesome rap cd. Deltron 3030 has the coolest rhymes and his lyrics are all about the future (3030). Its a real cool concept that i have never heard any other rapper rhyme about. Del's voice is very cool to and its hard to describe i suggest checking out the samples. All the songs are good but 3 stand out the most (in my mind) # 2, # 7 and #18."
5,Neo Phunk,"This is the rap counterpart to a Cowboy Bebop or Ghost in the Shell soundtrack. Absolutely mind blowing production and lyricisism, this is the direction hip hop should be taking in the 21st century. Music videos anyone ?"
5,Producing of the millenium,"Beautiful album, all the way around. Deep, rich melodical sounds integrated with incredible beats in one of the most musical albums I have heard in a good while - which is something to say considering its hip hop. And refreshing to say the least, in a world of annoyingly redundant ""image-hop"". Something new, interesting, thought-provoking, musical, entertaining - able to affect your mood... Something to expect from del/automater. Whoever says this album is bad doesnt know his music."
4,New World of Hip Hop,"If you have listened to previous Del albums, I would recommend this right off the bat. However, if you've never heard Del before, this album might take a little getting used to. As always, Del's lyrics are superior. His worst rhymes are better than a lot of MC's best rhymes. This time, he's backed up by the beats of Dan the Automator, which is the part that might take the getting used to. At first I was somewhat skeptical of the beats but after listening to the album several times I found them to be extremely good. They compliment Del's flows very well. Overall I would say this is one of Del's best albums and I am glad to see that he and the rest of the Hieroglyphics crew just seem to keep getting better as time goes on. The ability to adapt and progress seems to be their greatest strength. I would highly recommend this album to people who are true fans of hip-hop."
4,Easily the best hip-hop record of the year.,"Del (with help from the infallible Dan the Automator and Kid Koala) does it again and releases not only the best hip-hop record of the year, but one of the best records of the year PERIOD. This one is hard to compare to ""Both Sides of the Brain"" (which is also awesome) since the styles of the two are so different, but ""3030"" will definitely be of interest to fans of Del's previous records. Highest recommendation - If you don't like this one, you don't like hip-hop."
4,tight.,"this cd is tight, but you need to stop comparing kool Keith and Del to each other.. to that one kid saying Keith only disses other rappers... try listening to ""analog brothers"" ""black elvis"" and the new cd about to drop ""masters of illusion"" you'll see that Keith is more creative than ever, and funnier/better/uncanny... anyway I've just discovered Del this year by peeping his cd ""Both sides of the brain"" this kid has a sick flow, and vocab is off the deep end. I'd say Keith is better only because i think Keith is a better all around MC, meaning he can spit on ANY topic, has TOOOO many styles, and can outshine anyone in hiphop. but this album is off the hook, i was gonna sleep on it but i'm glad i didn't. this is a MUST have for any head who listens to rap/real or underground hiphop."
5,"yeah, it's like that",an anime inspired hip-hop concept album with raps that play out like kung fu fights; this is way too intelligent for mainstream.
4,"Not bad, not bad at all...","Crazy instrumentals courtesy of Dan the Automator and innovative vocals courtesy of Del make this a memorable album. Some cuts suffer from overproduction, however, (like ""3030"") and some of the skits are pointless (""Meet Cleofis...""), but it's overall a good effort worth an investment. Better than ""Dr. Octagon"", Dan's other big-name project, IMO."
5,Unbelievable...,"This album was unbelievable. Del, Dan, and Skiznod were phenomenal. Buy it now! Need I say more? I rate this album a smooth 420."
5,"You Look Suspect, I Must Check Your I.D.","The first song I heard off of 3030 was ""Memory Loss"", and after I heard it, I wanted to hear it again, and again, and again. After listening to it umpten times, I decided to go out and buy the CD. I wasn't dissapointed. Infectious rhymes and flow keep this hot, and I'm sure it'll be no stranger to my cd player."
5,A TRUE HIP HOP ENTHUSIEST,I'LL KEEP THIS SHORT. FORGET ABOUT THE PLATINUM PLUS BUS AND YOUR GOLD TEETH. DEL IS SO DEEP YOU CANT EVEN COMPREHEND. THIS IS THE BEST CD I OWN. THIS IS DELS AND AUTOMATERS BEST WORK YET. I NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS CD
5,Way better than Octagon,"While Dr. Octagon was a Koolkeith and Qbert project with Automator musicaly staying in the back with his spacey beats, this is a whole other animal. From the beautifuly crafted 3030 till the final outro, this record pleases. Thick syrupy beats create an atmosphere of a futuristic world celebrating Canadian bear (and the St Catherine St) and Del's unique voice jumps in and out of the beat. This ain't an album, its practicly an audio movie although not as blatantly as Prince Paul's ""prince of thieves effort"".My only complaint with the album is Kid Koala not getting enough shine on the album. His scratches are low-key and definitvely add to the sound, but I wish he'd have had a bit more room to show off his skills.... Welcome to the apocalyptic world where Hiphop meets A Brave New World."
4,Above average but not a classic,"One of my favorite Del cds, could have been better if Automater could have kept the production consistant. All the best stuff is in the beginning and then towards the end the tracks start losing momentum. Still a verry good CD, thats why I rate it 4 stars. My favorite track by far is Things you can do, that beat is awesome sounds like a beat from Zelda or FF."
5,A classic!,"Damn......what an album, the sounds produced by dan the automator are incredible. This album should be a blueprint for MCs of tommorow. Deltron 3030 is a trip, hip hop at his best and also really creative"
3,Too bad about the rap,Music is somewhat interesting (although not as revolutionary as many of the reviews may lead one to believe) but I found his rap style and lyrics to be pretty weak. So what that he has a basic understanding of Chem 101? Future Rhythm by Digital Underground goes with same theme and is far better album.
3,Very Enjoyable CD,"Del is just a classic MC. Its too bad many people probable don't even know who he is.The beats on this album are different, not something you would hear on the radio. I think thats what makes it interesting.My only complaint is that is seems like there are some filler songs. All the little skits, or whatever you could call them are irritating. Too many 46 second tracks that make the CD have to many tracks. Not a big deal however, there is more than enough great songs to listen too. Madness and Mastermind are probably my favorites.Overall its a good if not great CD. Pick it up if your a fan of Del or Hiero."
3,DEL_icious,"Deltron 3030 is an adventure through the twisted reality created by Del and Dan the automator. I preffered ""a much better tommorow"", but Deltron still has some crazy beats and Del always has a quick lick."
3,Sci-flo,"Because of a stupendous science fiction flow partnered by sometimes complimentary, but sometimes perspired beats, this still holds up relative to its competition."
1,It aint that hot!,"I recommend to save your money & pass this one up. I think everyone is jockin' DEL because of what he has released prior to this project. It really isn't that hot! I heard a DELTRON DIS from some underground kids that was alot better than most of the tracks on this CD. The crew that dissed them was called AUDIO DIRECT & they ripped it pretty good. You can check them out... As far as DELTRON, alot of the beats are what keep this album alive, not the flows( I guess thats why they released an instrumental CD)."
3,Just get a single of 3030,"I bought this CD for the track 3030, it's a gem. I was disappointed that the rest of the CD was only OK, too monotonous sounding. Just grab 3030 and move on."
5,good cd,if u are into underground hip hop you'll like this album. it has a lot of quality songs and you don't get tired of them.
3,2nd in the Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser series,"The second in the Fafrhd and the Grey mouser series. Includes the following stories:The Circle CurseThe Jewels in the ForestThieves HouseThe Bleak ShoreThe Howling TowerThe Sunken LandThe Seven Black PriestsClaws From the NightThe Price of Pain-EaseBazaar of the BizarreMost are pretty good; the best are probably 'Thieves House'and 'Claws from the Night'. But to be honest I don't really think fantasy works in a short story format. Horror and sci-fi yes, but not fantasy. Most of these stories seemed rushed. Fantasy, at least to me, requires a little bit of color and backstory."
3,Highly priced,"This CD is highly priced when one considers how readly available the Gone with the Wind soundtrack is. I bought it for GOLDEN EARRINGS which is not available in the U.S. Although it was recorded from vinyl and there aren`t many tracks, the sound is good with only minor flaws."
3,not meeting the strandard,"I bought this field jacket liner in order to replace an older one that is part of my cold weather uniform. This one keeps you warm alright,but it does not meet the military standards. (No buttons, not attachable to the field jacket, longer, different cut and thinner than the original issue!)So if you buy it for something else it will be great and warm and all just not as part of the uniform."
3,"Good Quality, Just way too large","The liner was quality made, but was WAY too large. When I placed it under my original liner, it was 2 inches longer and at least 4 inches wider, even though they were both Smalls. I had to have it taken in by a seamstress to make it not look like a barrel under my jacket. Need to offer an Extra Small if this is the smallest size available. This would have easily fit a 200 lb guy."
3,"adequate for warmth, improper fit","I gave this liner 3 stars because it actually does provide the extra warmth that it is meant to provide (even though it seemed very thin and questionable at 1st when I opened it) and all of the fasteners buttoned up as they should, however I was disappointed that the lower portion of this liner did not fit snug inside the Large Rothco M-65 Field Jacket that I purchased. The liner bulged inward (toward my stumoch) and looks awkward when the jacket is unzipped, though this is purely aesthetic and does not effect the function of the liner. Because I'm a ""form and function"" guy, I'm leaving it at 3 stars. I recommend it for the added warmth and if you don't car about aesthetics."
5,Keeps the Hubby warm,"I purchased this item for my husband. He is a police officer who works Night Duty. It requires him to stay outdoors for a period of time. Being that his job is in the Northeast, it gets COLD. He told me that this liner keeps him ""toasty."""
1,SHOCKED AT THE PRICE INCREASE!,"Wow! I have one can of Choplets left and decided it was time to order another case from Amazon. No Way. When I first started ordering them from Amazon about 3 years ago, they were $36.00 for a case of 12. Each time I order, I find that the price has increased. A case is now $70. As a couple of previous posters noted, I too have received many dented cans. At $70 a case, I no longer find dented cans acceptable. I will be looking elsewhere to purchase these. I think this product is absolutely delicious and I have been enjoying them since childhood, but I will not order from Amazon solely based on principle."
1,What's up with the price?!?,"I first bought a pack of 12 at $38. The price is now up by $30 to $68. This is insane and in no way does this fairly reflect the hike in gas prices. I could see a $5.00 raise ... maybe. But $30? These were $3.16 a can a year ago. They're now $5.67 a can. Any grocery store raising their prices that much, that fast, would be laughed out of business. This is is shameful. Get these prices in line, Amazon (or, if Worthington's responsible, get them to get their prices in line or drop the product).As far as the product? It was dropping in quality, anyway. It had gotten much slimier and, simultaneously, a strong grainy taste started overpowering the rest of the flavors (sort of like skunky beer)."
3,Disappointed with Amazon not Worthington,I am very disappointed with the condition that my Worthington products arrived in. Seven of the 12 cans were severely dented. I'll think twice about ordering from Amazon in the future. No wonder shipping was free. It was crap !!!
5,Wonderful product at a great price,"Vegetarian food can be difficult to get. Choplets are great dipped in egg and Italian bread crumbs, then crispy fried. Serve with garlic roasted potatoes and your favorite salad. Gravy is an option."
2,UPSET...,"I subscribe to ""Subscibe and Save"" the price for this product at the time was about $43.00. AFTER ABOUT A YEAR OF WAITING FOR THIS PRODUCT. Amazon shipped 15 cases to me without notifing me that the price was now $70.00. They should have least do a courtsey email informing me of the price and giving me a choice to cancel order. NOW I AM STUCK WITH 15 CASES AND NO WAY OF RETURNING THE PRODUCT...THAT TRULY SUCKS....AMAZON THIS IS UNFAIR...THE CUSTOMER SHOULD BE INFORM OF A PRICE CHANGE...I AM VERY UPSET AND WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN"
1,Hugely Disappointing!!,"I tried these Worthington ""Choplets,"" based upon two things; (1) my favorable experience with Worthington ""Prime Stakes"" and Worthington ""Swiss Stakes,"" and (2) the photo on the label of the ""Choplets"" can, suggesting what they look like. Folks, the photo is hugely misleading!!! These things are NOT breaded and the texture is like that of a slimey, gelatin-like substance. The taste is very disappointing also. I tried breading these myself and then heating them. It made little difference. It's too bad. Worthington really dropped the ball on this product."
1,poorly translated!,"The French translation for this book is not well done. I do not recommend it for anyone who is trying to teach their child proper French. The entire premise is that it's a bedtime book, and ""Goodnight moon"" implies saying goodnight as one goes to bed. ""Bonsoir lune"" implies more of a ""good evening"", as if one were being greeted in a restaurant for dinner. ""Bonne nuit"" would be a much more appropriate translation. This is just an example of several contextual as well as technical translating errors throughout the book."
4,Cassiebu,"A simple and easy translation in French so that even though, I haven't read the language for a long time, I knew what I was reading to my little one. The only downside is that the French doesn't rhyme the way the English version does."
1,Short but sweet,"I liked the title song though it was too short. I didn't like the fact that the remaining songs were not remotely of the same genre, but instead were essentilly finger exercises for classical guitar."
5,Hitachi Nicad 12 volt batteries,So far the batteries have a charge and worked great. Can't beat the free shipping.
3,Great toothbrush for mid-size to large dogs,"I was a little disappointed in this product. It is a great toothbrush, but I have small dogs - the product was a little on the large side to fit in my dog's mouth. I think that they ought to have a smaller size for smaller dogs."
1,Plastic is too thin,"I bought 4 of these and I'll probably end up throwing them away. The little teeth are good but the thimble part is so small and the plastic they made it out of is so thin that a suction gets created when you try to pull it off and it's a little like the chinese handcuffs I had as a kid - the harder you pull, the harder it is to get it off. Nobody tried them before they decided to freeze the design, I guess."
4,Not for the feint at heart...,"If you are in anyway aquatic, you need to see this production. I grew up near the beach in Santa Monica, CA. I was immersed in the beach scene from 9 years of age to 16 years. I'll tell you this, it was nothing like the world depicted in the Bra Boys DVD. Since the hard core experiences shown aren't for everybody, I gave the DVD 4 stars. Apart from that, I felt that Sunny Abberton did a great job of sharing the world that he and his brothers grew up in. I've always felt that one of the best things anyone can do is to see the world through someone else's eyes. The Bra Boys production makes this possible. The great thing about seeing it on the screen was that I wasn't in danger of being stabbed, shot, or washed over the shallow reef! Some of the elements expressed in this film include deep family ties, the bond of friendship, larrakin characters, oh... and some unbelievable surfing!"
1,Worst Game EVER!,"The PS2 version might have been ""playable"", but the PC version of this sorry excuse of a game is awful. The controls suck...the graphics are terrible unless you have a $300 graphics card, and the overall gameplay is boring, slow and absolutely mind numbingly stupid!"
5,Schwinn 231 Recumbent Exercise Bike as Advertised,"I received the product in perfect condition and on time. Amazon had easily the best deal. Assembly took about 2 hrs with the tools provided and the directions were easy to understand and accurate. I read the user's guide and was comfortable with the operation in about 15 min. The bike is so quiet that I watch tv at normal volume levels while I ride. If you prefer to ride with the fan on, that will, of course, change. There are so many programs to choose from that any desires for variety can be easily satisfied. The display is big and easy to read.I cannot at this early stage in my ownership, vouch for durability, but out of the box, I couldn't be happier. This bike appears to be a great value for the money."
2,Schwinn 231 review,"My wife bought this for my birthday and It has never performed properly since I received it. One of the main reasons I purchased the 231 was for the mounted fan and easy access to the fan. I have had two computer replacements and one fan replacements and the fan still does nothing. I was suppose to have a ""fan-and-computer"" set which was tested together prior to delivery, sent to me two weeks ago. They were never received. Since the box is gone and I refuse to pay for shipping, I guess I am stuck with this product."
1,Not happy with purchase,"I've been unhappy with this bike, especially for the price. It was shipped with the wrong pedal and had to mess with getting the right one shipped and now 2 years later, that same pedal is now coming off and it appears that the arm for the pedal is faulty and now have to deal with trying to get it fixed and the warranty period is over. So just 2 years after purchasing, am having to once again deal with trying to get it fixed. While the bike has been good to work out on when the parts work, its not the quality I'm used to seeing with past Schwinn products and given the price and the problems I've had, I do not recommend it. Very disappinted."
4,Great Bike but shipping packaging could be better.,"This is a great recumbent exercise bike for the price. Very impressed with how quiet it is and the programs available. It is very stable with a comfortable seat. The heart rate monitor seems to work very well. Overall I am very happy with the bike.Shipping is another story. I am thinking these are packaged well when multiple bikes are shipped on a pallet together. But when you put one of these out in to general shipping to an individual it does not hold up well. When I received my bike the plastic crank cover assembles were damaged and broken. I decided to keep the bike because it was cosmetic damage. Contacted Amazon who told me to contact Schwinn. I did and they were going to ship me new cranks covers and a crank removal tool. I have now received the parts with one exception, the crank covers did not come with the any decals installed. I have contacted Schwinn about this and I am sure they will ship them out."
3,Excellent Bike - BAD courier,"Everything about the bike (we actually got two) is fine and matching the many positive reports on this site. Assembly is easy and everything - even the tools - in the box. Bike and display are as good as the $2000 models you find in the gym.HOWEVER: BEWARE OFF ABF, the courier! In our case, they claimed that 1. we could not be reached and 2. that we refused delivery. Despite the fact that we called them immediately when receiving an e-mail from Amazon asking us to contact them directly leading to delivery on the following day, they threaten us with storage charges.This, to me, reeks of a systematic attempt to up their shipping charges. ""We are not amused"" - to say the least. I don't have a clue how people who work away from the house during the day can manage not being ripped off by their tactic..."
5,"Great Bike, Great Customer Service - lots of broken parts","The bike came in a box that wasn't beat up, but the left shround of the motor hosuing was completely cracled and busted up. I called Custoemr Service and just like everyone else said, they were great and shipped me a new part. After replacgin the left shroud, it was obvious that the right was broken too, but I wouldn't have known until I got the left replaced. So it was back to customer service for hte right shroud. That has arrived, but I haven't had the time to replace it yet."
4,Great bike..have a helper for assembly,"Bike performs very well. However, the fan ran for less than a minute and then died completely. This bike is a little tricky to put together. Don't try it yourself, you need another person and need to be a bit mechanically inclined.Called Nautilus right after we received, was promised a new console/fan would be to me in 4-5 days. Never received. Emailed several times before the reply was that they have had problems with the consoles, they are making new batch, and it will be another 2 weeks. Not a problem, as the bike is great--quiet, efficient, stable, and the fan doesn't look like it would do much anyway.Fabulous shipping, tho they would not bring to my second floor, and this is a very heavy item."
3,Schwinn 231 Recumbent,"I received, via UPS, this product in a carton that had gaping holes in the side and it is a miracle that no parts were missing. The bike generally very well built but, as others have noted, the fan does not work. I have emailed Nautilus tech support/customer service five times over a week's time and have received no response so I'll try the telephone next. Assembly was straightforward except for the fact that the rear stablizer shape did not mirror the curve in the mainframe and it took me what seemed like forever to get the bolts seated in the mainframe holes. All bolts/nuts, etc. were nicely sealed in shrink wrap and labeled. I have used several programs that functioned properly. A shortcoming others have noted is that a separate power adaptor must be connected externally to the bike. In addition, the computer will accept only one user profile which is a drawback. From a total perspective, this is a pretty nice unit considering the price."
5,We love it!,"I bought this bike for my husband for Father's Day. I was worried about putting it together, and had our local bike shop on stand-by at their rate of $70 if I was unable to complete the mission. However, I found the directions to be easy to understand and follow. Every piece fit as it was supposed to and works perfectly, including the fan (which some people have had trouble with). It's quiet and smooth-riding. I think I'm going to enjoy it as much as he does. I'm 5' 1"" and he's 6'...and we both can use it comfortably. Great product...and Amazon had the best price by FAR!"
5,Schwinn 231,"This is a superbly-engineered and exceptionally well-built machine: silent; unbelievably smooth; comfortable; and, rock steady even for a 6'5"", 255 lb rider like myself. It comes with a glossy assembly manual that clearly illustrates each step of the process, and indexes the components to their fasteners. The 2.5 hours mentioned by others for assembly is accurate if only one person does it (with occasional help from another,) and much of this involves cutting fasteners off their vacuum-sealed, very well-indexed packing! The 43-page glossy operations manual included is also clear and well-written, and includes helpful sections on fitness. This is a great value, particularly with the current $100 discount. Highly recommended!"
4,could be better,There were 2 small parts missing which I will order separately that do not affect the use of this bike . This exercise bike could have a self contained power supply instead of relying on external electrical power.
1,Absolute Junk,I would give it zero stars if I could. Box came completely damaged. Outside plastic part was broken and cracked. Took 3 hours to put together and the resistance did not work. More of a hassle than it is worth.
5,"Biology: Student Study Guide, Sixth Edition","It's a condense textbook basically ,covering everything you need to know about the textbook, although it shouldn't be anyone's substitute to the text, the study guide provides a good guide to what to know and expect on exams. It also offers more questions to practice and to familiarize yourself with, and that always helps."
2,Disappointing,"Although I congratulate Ms. Kuffel on her success in leaving the Planet of Fat, I was turned off by the tones of self-pity and self-loathing that permeate this book. Ms. Kuffel spends a great deal of time judging herself - and others - according to body weight and other superficial attributes. Her descriptions of ""the Stepfords"" (women who followed the same eating plan Ms. Kuffel used), different ""types"" of fat women, and ""laws about men"" are simplistic and somewhat mean-spirited. I wish that the author had deepened her analysis more and questioned the premises that seem to have informed her desire to lose weight and her response to accomplishing that goal."
4,Inspirational,"I enjoyed this book. As I continue on my weight loss journey, I read and re-read the book when I plateau. I appreciated Frances Kuffel's honesty about how obesity had left its marks on her body and that even with the weight loss she will never be body-beautiful. Especially moving was her honesty about how losing weight didn't solve all her problems as so many of we heavyweights believe deep down."
1,"THIS BOOK IS GARBAGE, THE AUTHOR IS A HORRIBLE PERSON...","Seriously, this is one of the most boring books I've ever read. The author doesn't provide any details about her weight loss journey. That's kind of important because that's the main reason I picked up this book(probably why other people decided to read it too)! Ms. Kuffel's story was not inspiring, humorous or interesting. She's a snob, cold hearted, beyond conceded. Funny thing is, she's ugly; inside and out. I really dislike this woman. She mentions a few times how she hates fat people, um, excuse me? The majority of people who are going to read your book are fat or have been fat! So rude. Also, what's with the overuse of big words? This began to irritate me within the first few chapters. Who does she think she is? What a waste of time. THE WORST BOOK EVER!"
5,Inspiring,"I love this book. Every time I get discouraged when I'm trying to lose weight, I pull this book back out and it really helps me."
2,Compelling but mean-spirited,"I too could not put this book down, and read it in 3 short evenings. What was genuine was the checkered voyage of self-discovery she encountered as she went from 300+ to 150-. Her storytelling was engaging and I truly felt like I was in the bat cave with her at times.What was off-putting in the novel was her unabashed meanness towards herself, her family and others. When her dates would compliment her and say she was nice, I, as a reader, didn't agree. One would have hoped having walked in ""fatty"" shoes herself, that she would be more sympathetic towards others struggling to accomplish what she had. Instead, I found her judgements of those starting their journey appalling.Frances may be beautiful and thin on the outside, but there's something still quite ugly on the inside. I give her credit for being brutally honest about her feelings, but I hope in retrospect, it helped her heal and find compassion for others."
4,Flawed but thoughtful and compelling,"After reading about this book in the O magazine, I devoured it (hmmm...interesting choice of verb), reading it in a bookstore over a week. Months later when it came out in softcover, I bought my own copy.Frances obviously still struggles with her disease, and yes, I would like to know more about the abusive older brother, and sometimes I get frustrated at the occasional pettiness and that interesting dichotomy of narcissism and desperation. But I greatly identify with it, and her description of the sensual allure of food to deal with her psychological pain is chillingly close to my own. Like her, I have lost half my body weight while a member of a 12 step program. Like her, I continue to struggle with my mental anguish and pain that continually threatens to suck me back into my obsession/addiction. I applaud her bravery in showing herself to us with flaws, not airbrushed out like most diet/lifestyle polemics dominating the bookshelves."
2,Are we supposed to be happy for her?,"I'm glad she finally found some degree of self-fulfillment, but there are better ways to learn to like yourself than losing 150 pounds. My concern is that this book perpetuates the myth that thin=happiness and fat people are emotionally disturbed in some way. Definitely there are a lot of people who have emotional issues that affect their eating habits, but often the cure is to work on the emotional issues instead of another diet. If your happiness is contingent on your weight, it's likely that you'll never really be satisfied. If this book does anything good, it is in showing that that losing weight will not make your problems go away."
3,Good Testimonial --- Poor Writing,"I have never been obese; nor did I need to guide my children from it. This is a very detailed testimony of the problems obesity can bring to those who are obese, and that most of us never think of. I would recommend it for parents of children who have fallen into our obese society of ""Fat Americans"", but I would be appalled if they felt it was good literature...Frances should be proud of her accomplishments, but should hone her skills at writing. Communication is not her forte. I saw her on the Today Show and bought the book because of curiosity on eating disorders in general - I am a recovered anorexic. I hope Frances can enjoy the remainder of her life. Perhaps, in days to come she can lose the weight of anger she continues to take along with her veggies."
1,ABOUT AS INSPIRING AS TOAST....,"If you want inspiration go to a twelve step meeting and meet people who live the steps and not those who break the tradition of anonymity. ""They have no Stars or VIPS""This volume was as thin as anyone could get when it comes to wisdom and grace, and as shallow as one can be while being colorful. Credit through to her wrting style; however style without substance and integrity is well.. Fox news comes to mind!"
3,kids love it- parents hate it,"well, This is one of the movies that I swore I would never have in my house, but my 3 year old son BEGS for it every time we are at the video store, so I am finally breaking down and buying it for him for his birthday. Both of our kids are mesmerized by this, they sing all the songs ( A warning here, these are HORRIBLY written songs, and they tend to stick in your head for days) until I make them stop. the only thing worse, is Casey singing the song ""Nine Lives"" on the other real animal video about cats... the kids love that one too. I give this tape 3 stars purely on the entertainment value from the kids aspect....and that it keeps them glued long enough for me to cook dinner!"
1,I did not like this movie,"I am 13 years old and I thought this movie was for young children. I have also been riding approx. 5 years and did not agree with some of the ways they were handling the horses. And Casey, I think was very annoying. Way to much coffee!! I have a three-year old sister and even she got disgusted over time with casey. also, some parts were NOT ensuring the safty of those kids."
1,I can't take it anymore!,"I am so disappointed in this video that I just had to write about it! My son loves horses and so we bought this video in the hopes that it would show alot of video about horses. Well, apparently the people who made this video think the rest of us are interested in watching the goofy adults dance around and sing really bad songs about horses. When the horses are running around and jumping, half of the time the horse is barely visible and the camera is on the rider! It is a very frustrating video. I honestly can't tell you how frustrated I get by not showing the horses....oh well, live and learn...I definitely would not buy it again."
3,Fun & educational but recording is of poor quality,"This is a lighthearted, fun and lively video showing the daily care of horses. My two toddlers adore horses, and I couldn't wait to pop this tape in to capture their attention with live action. Though the scenes are authentic and there is much to learn from the animal's characteristics to how to bathe and brush them, the picture quality is so poor that it makes watching it in its entirey a real chore. There is a graininess to the video that doesn't change on smaller screens, so basically you won't enjoy watching along with your kids. The actors in the film deliver their lines in a way that truly seems rehearsed from script, but this won't matter to kids since they speak clearly and in simple to understand language. The music is very sweet too. They also incorporate special needs children in the film, which is a refreshing change. It's just too bad the film company didn't record on a faster speed tape to ensure clarity."
5,Favorite Video in our home,My children love this video and I have to limit the amount they watch it. Its very informative-- even for the adult. ITS MY HORSE LOVERS FAVORITE SHOW!
3,Good for young children who like horses,"My two children (2yrs and 3yrs) LOVE this movie. I think that it's a good movie for small children who like horses, and it gives some general information about horses, etc. My kids also like the songs."
5,"Fenwick, keeper of the reindeer","I ordered this video hoping it was the one I remembered seeing at Christmas time on t.v. when I was little. It is indeed the same delightful story of Fenwick, the little elf who doesn't seem to fit in anywhere, until Santa discovers that his true talent is caring for the reindeer and his generous and loving nature. There is a short animated introduction to the film, but the story itself is portrayed by live actors, including Johnnie Whitaker as Snap the elf, Walter Slezak as Santa, and the adorable Michael Link as Fenwick. Hopefully this little film will be restored someday and put out on dvd, but until then this vhs version will bring back many happy memories."
5,TRY TO SHUT HER UP!!!,"There are billions of reasons of why does this DVD is great. 1st of all, i already have it and I will tell you that she performs all of the songs from ""Let Go"", a song called ""I Don't Give"", the Green Day's song ""Basketcase"", and a beautiful song called ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"". This DVD has all the necesary to be a success!!! You won't be dissapointed, and in the outtakes, Avril tells some histories about herself, and some of them are really funny...so you will enjoy the concert and the music videos (Complicated, Sk8er Boi, I'm With You, Knockin' On Heaven's Door and Losing Grip), and you will laugh with her histories. Buy it now! Oh, and the song ""Why"" from the Bonus CD is really good, so don't be afraid about the new songs and videos that it has, just get it, because it's great and all of Avril's fans will love it; and the people that isn't an Avril's fan, will become one!. That is all I can tell you now about it. Bye."
4,Avril rocks it onstage !~!,"First off I hesitated buying this DVD, thinking, when am I actually going to watch this? But the Avril Lavigne dvd surprised me. So give it a chance, even if your not a huge fan you'll like it. The concert footage is the part to actually watch, if you missed her on the Try to Shut me Up tour,the footage makes up for it."
1,I hoped for more,"Being a fan of Avril, I hoped for a lot more actually interesting performance than what was on the dvd. Mostly, she stood in one place or sat on the edge of the stage. If I had wanted a performance like that, I would've listened to the cd. The upside to this, however, is covers. She played Basketcase by Green Day, Fuel by Metallica, and Knockin' on Heaven's Door by Bob Dylan. The set also comes with a cd of six songs, four of them covers.Another thing that disappointed me is her explanations behind some of the songs; her explanation and the lyrics clashed.What it adds up to is, don't buy this set for the dvd, it sucks; and the cd is only worth it if you are a die-hard fan."
2,Buy one only if you are a fanatic fan of her.,"Avril's first album is great. In the album, Avril delivers her lyrics so well that at first, I couldn't believe the fact she was a teenager.Then this My World DVD came out. Well, after watching the DVD, I couldn't believe the girl in the video was the same girl, who made a phenomenal debut album. It's sure exciting to see her live performance, but obviously she can't hit the right notes.Her voice is now way too lower than before, and she has trouble hitting high notes. Her worst performance can be seen on COMPLICATED; I had to turn down the volume. Now I have to wonder if she used a pro-tool on her first album to get pitches fixed. Although she has a good voice, she ain't a good singer, at least on stage. She is still a good songwriter, though.In short, I wouldn't recommend this DVD to those who have good ears in music."
1,Ugh,"Avril's music is ok but I hate this DVD. She's trying to be ""gothic"" or whatever and it doesn't work. It looks like she shopped at Hot Topic or something. Avril, quit being goth! You have no reason too! And you aren't gothic. Therefore, get singing lessons, and make a CD...because girl sorry you can't sing. But yeah, Avril plays the guitar so it's ok but 1 star for this goth imitation DVD."
4,avril fan,i liked this concert as i do all her cds and concerts. i like her style and her stage presence is great.
2,SAME AVRIL,i BOUGHT THIS DVD AND I THINK THAT ITS ALRIGHT BUT NOTHING GREAT. ITS JUST THE SAME AVRIL DOING THE SAME SORTA THING FOR EVERY SONG. TRY TO GET SOME MORE VARITY IN WHAT YOU DO AVRIL AND CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES AT LEAST ONCE. BESIDES THE BONUS FEATURES ARE PRETTY BORING AS WELL. THE ONLY 5 OUT OF 5 THINGS ABOUT THIS DVD IS THAT IT HAS ALL THE AV VIDEOS UP UNTIL KNOCKIN' ON HEAVENS DOOR AND IT GOES FOR A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME.. tHE CONCERT ALSO SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR LONGER. tHE CONCERT IS NOTHING SPECIAL. THANX FOR READING MY REVIEW BUT I THINK THAT ANY LAVIGNE FAN SHOULD OWN THIS DVD AT LEAST ITS BETTER THAN SK8ER GIRL DVD.
2,Avril's voice a letdown live,"Despite an all-around well-produced and entertaining concert and backstage footage, MY WORLD comes up short where it counts the most: Avril Lavigne's singing. What were the best moments in LET GO become the sadly disappointing worst parts on stage, as Avril's voice turns boyishly deep and then resorts to atonal yelling where her songs are most demanding. (On the other hand, in covering less difficult GREEN DAY and METALLICA hits, she actually sounds better than the original vocalists.) This problem may be due to the wear-and-tear of touring on her young and delicate vocal chords--MY WORLD was filmed on the last North American tour date--but, nevertheless, it doesn't help Avril's reputation as a performing artist to showcase this weakness."
3,ok,"A product is produced and the production is really kind of poor. The purpose of this product is to showcase someone's talents and her talents are kind of poor. Some of the songs done are great songs and thats where the 3 stars come into play. Now if you want me to just rate the DVD product I would have to give it 5 stars as the DVD works and is a wonderful invention. Other then that this product is another recording industry deception. The playing is sub par, the singing is sub par, the theatrics again sub par. The only reason this girl has a recording contract is because they needed a Britney Spears for the teen grunge pop genre. I would have given it less starts, but the DVD works and some of the actual songs used to be good before being torn apart by Avril."
2,not even close to reality,Excessive mental lusting and ogling mixed with improbable military operations equals a very disappointing book.
3,okay album - but not Piazzolla,"For this album (recorded in 1998, after Piazzolla's death), Gary Burton assembled a high quality line-up of tango musicians including three members of Piazzolla's quintet - Fernando Suarez Paz (violin), Hector Console (bass) and Horacio Malvacino (guitar). The results, sometimes intriguing, are not bad, but never as good as the man himself.If you are looking for the Burton/Piazzolla album from 1995 it's called ""New Tango"""
1,much ado about nothing,1. do not buy if you expect to get any useful information.2. there are more pro movies on youtube3. one star for nice box
2,Not enough graphical illustrations.,"Basically there's not enough illustrations for a beginner to be able to get into T'ai Chi. The text part of the book is solid, thorough even, but the graphical examples are few and far between. A book on physical movement meant for beginners should have ample illustrations of everything. This book has very, very few. Buy it if you're new and are more interested in the philosophy and benefits or don't mind reading about how to do a physical act, stay far away if you want images that show you."
5,Great teaching book,You can never go wrong purchasing one of the FOR DUMMIES books it seems. This book was excellent for Tai Chi training and learning new things. I recommend it.
4,Not for Dommies - a smart read!!,"Tai Chi is a great martial art and exercise program, and this book is a pretty good intro to it for a novice. Most of the moves can be learned at a basic level, so you could see it the sport was suitable for you and then maybe take a class. Worth a look."
4,I like it,"Bought the book used, and it was like brand new; great condtion, no marks, no folds, no tears. The material is well-written and I believe at an appropriate level for self-study. It could use a few more pictures, but the written instructions are very clear.I would recommend it without any reservation."
5,Very detailed and good for the money,Used this book for a report on the basis of Tai Chi and got alot more than that! The other is humorous and candid and does a very good job of explaining concepts.
2,Not very well done,"First off, I'm not an expert on T'ai Chi, so I'm not qualified to tell you whether this book presents an accurate portrait of T'ai Chi or not. I'm just a beginner, and I was looking for a suitable book for beginners. I have found many dummies books to be of extremely high quality, written by experts who are able to distill their knowledge effectively to teach people who don't know anything about the subject. However, I found this book disappointing. The author seems to have practiced for only a few years, and doesn't seem to have the broad base of knowledge of an expert. As such, I would feel uncomfortable relying on this book for information. It's not a bad introduction to the topic, and if all you're interested in is learning some basic moves to add to your exercise routine, this book will help you get started. But if you really want to understand T'ai Chi, I wouldn't trust this book to teach it to you."
5,Better than the Package lens,"I decided to skip the default included Nikor lens that gets bundled with the D80. I decided to look for a nice 2.8 lens to allow for as much light as possible with my new DSLR. The lens is very light and moves with a nice fluidity when zooming. It takes many standard filters for its' class and is well worth the price. So far it performs on scale with lenses twice it's price. I have had sharp focus from corner to corner and a nice focal range. If you're looking for a nice budget lens for your new DSLR, this should be one."
5,Great value in a very versatile lens!,"This lens (28-70mm) has been on my Nikon D50 camera most of the time since purchasing it, even though I have 2 other lenses (50mm and 70-300mm Nikkor). This (Sigma) lens is a full stop faster than the Nikon equivalent (and it is less costly!). It comes with a cool looking lens hood that has a bayonet style fitting to the lens. I rated this 5 stars because it is a great value. I highly recommend this lens for someone who wants to take good pictures and doesn't want to spend a small fortune on a lens. Great value!"
5,Love it,"This is a wonderful lens. We use it to take pictures of our martial arts class on a Nikon D80. Overall a great setup for indoor, close up action"
3,"Cheap Lens, Price and Quality-wise","This lens is very cheap for its large aperture, but be warned, it is not very sharp and the auto-focus tends to hunt. If you are photographing as a novice to professional, this lens will not be able to make large prints without you noticing the blurriness in the photos. In 4x6 prints, the lens seems sharp.The lens feels pretty cheaply made, but does not feel flimsy. There is no lens creep whatsoever.I have dropped this lens from 4 feet with no damage about a month ago."
2,The lens in the picture is not the lens you will receive,"Edit: The picture was updated to show the correct lens.The lens pictured is a Sigma 28-70mm EX (pro-grade) f/2.8. The lens you receive is the Sigma 28-70mm f/2.8-4 as said in the description. I needed to use the Amazon A-Z guarantee to get a refund for this lens from 47th street photo. FYI, 47th St. delivers fast but they do not honor their return policy, so if you order from them, I hope you get what you expect!"
4,good price for a good product,"This has been my first dedicated running shoe in a while. I would say that I have been very pleased with this shoe. It is light, flexible, and very comforable. I suppose that a hard core runner could recomend a better shoe for 3 or 4 times the price, but for a shoe around $50, this is fairly good."
1,Still not here,Ordered it in October its now November 27th. still not here. Its been almost a month. Im still wondering where it is.
2,"Drugs, violence and incest have rarely been so tiresome","Of these seven stories, only ""Under the Pitons,"" about love among drug-runners, pulls off the grand, sweeping melodrama that most of the rest just nod toward, and only ""Miserere,"" about a woman who rescues aborted fetuses for burial, feels like a true short story. The other works seem like abandoned novels. They are filled with characters that are hopelessly self-indulgent (the alcoholic in ""Helping,"" the drug-addicted daughter in the title story) and tediouslyself-important (the incestuous poet in the title story, the drugged-out poet in ""Porque No Tiene, Porque Le Falta""), with plots that lead to violent, cop-out endings. The writing often seems disengaged, and even bored. On the whole, a surprising disappointment."
4,"A nice huge microwave,","Being two cubic feet the top vibrates during use, it's a huge piece of metal sitting there, so you might need a small rug or huge doily to cover it. The controls are a little confusing as far as figuring out how to set the correct power setting.but I'm a little forgetful.It has plenty of power and plenty of room to cook just about anything.A terrific deal, on a very good microwave and I had free delivery."
1,Amazon sent a broken unit,Amazon sent an unsafe unit; responded with a replacement which ups dropped off the truck; then refused to send a third. I went elsewhere.
3,An excellent book for beginners and a nice basic reference,"Of all the cooking books out there, this would be the one book I would recommend for anyone who wants to learn to cook, but has no kitchen experience at all. It explains basic kitchen terminology and methods in very basic terms....even a child could understand them. If you have much kitchen experience at all, you probably won't learn a whole lot from this book, but it does serve me well as a reference book. For example, if I can't remember exactly how long or how hot to bake a potato, I turn to Cooking for Dummies. It's recipes also serve as a wonderful jumping off point for developing your own cooking creativity. The recipes are very basic, and can always be changed or doctored up to your own tastes."
4,Great Book for starters,This is a great book for someone interested in starting to learn how to cook. It doesn't matter whether you are young or old but if you're interested in learning many basic recipes this is an easy book to learn from.
5,Book Review,"I had originally bought this book as a 'Joke' for my daughter. After it arrived, I paged through it and found it to be very good. Ruined my joke, but I went back and bought six more for Christmas presents. Nothing what I had expected. Very, very good book."
5,Great book for neophytes,"A great little book for those who are kitchen-phobic. Tells you what to buy in terms of ingredients and equipment, with great starter recipes"
2,Not an instruction manual,"This is just a [not very good] cookbook. I know very little about cooking, and I wanted a book on HOW to cook. This book mainly consists of recipes.I bought this book at a (walk-in) bookstore largely because of it's title. I thought that it would have info such as ""onions caramelize at this temperature"", ""steak should be baked at this temperature for this amount of time"", etc. The book has a little info on technique, but it's largely in the introductions.I would not recommend this book."
3,A little TOO basic,"But I didn't buy it for myself. My neice thinks it's great, and since she just got her first apartment and never learned to cook, this is going to be her bible. But if you REALLY need to learn the basics, like how to hold a knife or peel an apple, this book is for you."
3,The Perfect Present...Almost,"I bought this for my cooking-challenged spouse Bessie and she was not amused. In fact, the last time I saw this supposedly useful book was when it bounced off the top of my head. Be careful who you give this to."
2,Not true to size,"This is in no way a Ladies size 4, more like a 5 or 6. Didn't fit too well in my Asics either, but it seems like it would be comfortable in any other shoe that I could remove the insole to."
4,Not for beginners,"A beautiful book but not for amateur cooks. The recipes can be complex and are aimed, for the most part, at the epicurean."
2,Doesn't work..,This product does not work. I tried it a ton of times and followed the instructions exactly. Left a ton of hair behind and after the pain of ripping it off I was disappointed. I would not buy this product stick with the muslin strips and original wax.
5,A work of monumental importance,"Creative Evolution is not so much a work, but a milestone in print of a new direction of thought. It is a book that is of immense importance to anyone who wants to understand the mystery of humanity."
3,Decent workout.,"I purchased the Kickboxing workout because this style is one of my favorites. This is my first experience with Janis Saffell as an instructor. I found her style (as well as one of the other instructor's) to be well spoken and easy to follow. I also found the value (4 DVDs for a great price) to be a benefit. I did not, however, find the workouts to be challenging nor much of a cardio routine. Based on the value and ease of instructors, I would recommend it for beginners or those new to exercise but not for more advanced."
3,Funny but not exciting,"The DVD title just about says it. He is not the exciting young keyboard player that he used to be. Maybe I have heard a little too much of Rick over the years and maybe we have both turned a bit old and grumpy. For newer fans this DVD should be great. For those who have heard Rick in 1970, he needs something new."
5,Beautiful book!,Este es el libro clasico mas bello para ninos. Era mi poema preferido cuando era nina. Ahora se lo leo a mi hija y todavia se me aguan los ojos al leerlo. Trasmite una gran ensenanza y sensibilidad. Ensena al nino a ayudar al projimo y a los mas necesitados. Lo recomiendo!
1,Ebook Version Incomplete,"I love the story but the kindle ebook version only has the text. It does not include the cover, title page, or copyright page. Please redo this ebook and include these pages. My ebook is incomplete."
1,no drawings.,This book might be good for older children. But i don't think my 5 year old will like it. No illustrations.
1,Cheap Junk,"I plugged these cables in once and the center pin broke off of one of them. I had to use pliers to get it out. Don't waste your time or money, pay a little more and get a better product."
4,good purchase,"This cable works very well with my PC, even though it has 7-pin SVDO output port. My only recommendation would be to purchase a cable which is atleast 3 ft long, else it will be difficult to connect your PC with your TV."
1,wrong scarf,"although they sent me a Red Sox scarf it was not this one. I searched high and low for this one and in the end, didn't get the one I wanted. they sent me one that wasn't even on the site and wasn't happy with it. couldn't return it, bec it was a Christmas present. unhappy Sox fan!"
3,If you like land of the loops....,"This is a cool CD with some really odd ""Land of the loops"" type of tracks. If you havent heard much of land of the loops' stuff, this CD isnt good for an opening.. rather, get ""Bundle of Joy."" But, this CD is still cool. I love the drums in the background."
2,Clips,"I bought these to use on chip or other snack bags. I was not thrilled with the product as they are too small to really hold a bag shut. However, it could be because they are size small. I recommend getting a larger size if they offer it. The actual product is fine, easy to use, and durable."
5,Nice clips,"These are really nice clips. They hold the bags tightly and the ""ears"" close down so they are out of the way and can't be accidentally opened. Great for chips and stuff."
3,I Contented With It,"Not for beginners! Hence the ""Series 2"" part of the title. There are 3 Combinations of moves. Each Combination has 3 stages. Excellent narration! Combinations are harder than the one before. I think all of the examples are repeated enough times. Each stage has sections for the leader, follower, and as a couple. A lot of combinations of moves are taught. One CAVEAT: I think it's International Style; not American. But I still enjoyed it. It's worth the discounted price I paid through Amazon."
4,Stylish Cardigan,"This cardigan is very stylish and looks great on, the different colour flecks through out the wool give it an unusual but pretty look. Looks great casual or dressed up."
3,Seems thorough and a good value but light on trauma,"I bought this for my bug-out bag. It seems quite the good value with lots of good stuff for general problems. Trouble is, I don't feel it's a good trauma kit for when one might get shot. I'm still working the details, but I think the best kit is probably a hybrid of the kits readily available. I'm going to add to his one. Need some clotting agents and more heavy bandages. This is the yuppy ""I went kayaking this weekend"" kit. Not the ""I just got attacked by a cougar and I have a 8 inch open gash in my abdomen"" kit. I'm kinda looking for the cougar kit. I'd say buy this to start, then supplement with what else you think you are missing. Depending on what you are looking for, this kit is 5 star or 3 star. If skin staplers and sutures aren't on your list, this kit is great. If you're trying to fix a bullet wound or serious trauma, this will need to be enhanced."
5,Fast Shipping,"The medical kit arrived in record time. I've used this on hiking trips before and it has just about everything you would need. You may want to get an extra roll of moleskin if your hiking as you will probably use up what they give you rather quickly. Other than that, it is an essential item in my travel bags. This one's going in my car emergency backpack.Steve BerryBattery Universe[...]"
1,Contents expired,"This first aid kit looks great, and is ideal for the 3-5 person hiking/camping trips that I take with friends and with family. However, the item shipped to me from Amazon was full of expired medical items. I purchased a similar item from a local outdoor-ing retailing. Give yourself enough time to expect a refund before getting a valid item."
1,EXPIRED GOODS,All of the ointments/pills expired in mid to late 2007.Don't waste your money/time with this seller.
1,Package had medications that expired in 2007,"Opened the box from Amazon today, saw through the bag that some of the meds expired in 2007 (!) Sent it back and will build my own kit with current meds."
4,Truly lightweight!,"I bought this kit for a backpacker trip through Costa Rica. It truly was light weight and took up little room in the backpack. I had to add a couple of things, like small scissors for cutting moleskin, and a few extra bandages, and there was plenty of room to put these in the kit. I have not had opportunity to test the water tight aspect of the kit, but based on my satisfaction so far, I have no doubts it will live up to this claim as well."
5,No one wants to use one but everyone needs one.,This is exactly what I was looking for in planning a 7+Day kayak trip for about 6. It says only up to 4people but if you don't go out adventuring with noobs this should be good enough. I added a foil emergency blanket and a pair of HeatFactory pads in case of hypothermia. It's surprisingly small and light. Putting together a medkit such as this would cost a lot more and wouldn't be nearly as light nor waterproof. Hope I don't need it but now I feel confident in case of emergency.
4,Destiny almost reached,"Billy Harper is one of the best concerts I have ever been to in any music genre. His spriituality borders Coltrane. I recommend him to any Jazz fan, and this album is a decent sample of his stuff. I have to admit, though, that I'm a little burned out by My Funny Valentine covers. Try him, you'll like him."
5,GREAT CONCERT,"ONE OF THE BEST CONCERTS AROUND. GREAT SOUND AND VIDEO. ALL THE HITS ARE HERE AND A FEW EXTRAS TOO. ONLY DRAWBACK IS NO"" MIDNIGHT IN TOKYO""; HOWEVER IT APPEARS ON THE BONUS CD, SO 5 STARS IT IS. WORTH THE MONEY."
2,Great band but could have been better.,Shame about the cold Dave had and the distorted sound. Otherwise it's always good to see Y&T live!
5,EXCELLENT !!!!!,"JUST EXCELLENT !!!!! (FOR FANS & NOT ONLY)BRAVO & MANY THANKS to the guys who were very kind to produce this dvd.All those rock bands of the 70s deserve it..SHAME on the record labels they don't sign contracts for such great bands ( Y&T;, Blue Oyster Cult,etc...)"
1,can't one of you blowhard tell us what SONGS are on the album,"Y&T is known for doing their crapiest songs, mostly ballads, in concert. I can believe with over 30 reviews no one actually bothered to give us a SONG LIST, since the record label could not be bothered to do so."
5,Y&T Still Rock!,Dave's voice sounds as great as ever and they play tight renditions of their numerous hits in a surprisingly small venue. Great videography captures them up close. Nice bonus performances too of them playing outdoors at a German heavy metal festival.
1,Don't Buy it,"This is one of the worst things I have ever purchased from Amazon. it's very liquid like and the first time i tried it it was nice but the second time and after it smelled horrible. the smell has nothing to do with the fragrance which I own, it stinked.Don't bother buy it's a waist of money."
4,Flying Circus,The book is great! My kids and I love it! Unfortunately it took over two weeks to get it from the seller. The Pony Express would have been faster!
4,Excellent Product,"I finally upgraded my Sharp Wizard OZ-9500 organizer,(I know its old!), to a Pocket PC. I shopped and read reviews for months before I bought it... and it's probably the best purchase I've made in a while. Rather than repeat everyone else's comments, I'll ditto them and add the following:-It's not a Palm, it is truly a Pocket PC. -I waited for the iPaq, but didn't like the add-on CF port which added size and $$ to the unit. Casio was too bulky. -HP works flawlessly, Active Sync was easy to install and works by itself. Perfect sync all the time. -Bought a Sandisk 48MB card which is a great option when considering MP3's and Windows Media.The only negative is finding accessories in the store... You'll find things on the net, but things like leather cases, you really want to touch it in a store and try it out. Hopefully this will improve in the near future.Peace"
5,I think this device is great!,"The 540 has performed flawlessly for me. I've had no synch probs and am using an optional USB cable. The MP3 sound is wonderful with mediocre earbuds or headphones. Viewing pics from my dig cam is a very nice feature, too. I was worried that the screen might be too small for any serious reading of e-books but I have had no problem using the Reader program. Pocket word and excel info synchs and e-mails without a hitch. And I think the design is really a head-turner. It feels very comfortable in the hand."
2,Good luck w/ synch & win 2000,"Purchased the 540 & serial cradle in May. Worked great w/ win 98. Upgraded to new laptop w/ Win 2000. Win 2000 is wonderful - hot swap of PCMCIA cards, etc. But - every time new software is installed, the synch breaks. Not sure if its MS Active Synch or HP - no one else seems to know either. Even my network support guru's at the office have no luck, and nothing on the bulletin boards. This baby's going back it just doesn't work. Maybe Compaq has their act together."
2,SUPER OUTDATED,"This product is very old but durable. To sync it you need to have a super-downgraded active-sync. I used it for personal notes and word documents, but it did not last long. the internet service needed for it is too outdated to use. I would not recommend this product due to its battery life and inability to connect online or to a computer without very downgraded synchronizing tool. Just save your money for a windows phone..."
2,"Good product for the Mulah, Bad product for everything else","Just read The topic my freinds, Just read the topic.....*sighs*....(Sheesh! what a HUGE disapointment..oh well back to my good 'ol aero 1550!)"
5,Great!,"I purchased this for my husband. We had an old King James Exhaustive Concordance, but needed a more modern one for the NIV translation. We've found it very useful."
4,It was good! :],I really liked this one!! It was werid to find out that Tommy owned Acorn!! I liked the part when she did her homework with Acorn. It was well written and more interesting than the 1st one. Anna was a good charecter and it had more plot twists. The drawings were good and it had a lot more exciting parts. I would reccomend this book to anyone who likes ponies.
4,A very educational book.,"It helped my one boy with his self esteem. He realized that other kids have some problems in school, but can do other activites real well. My other boy who read the book found out it is nice to pick on others because they aren't as smart as you. He also seen how lucky his brother is becaus e he can ride a horse, well."
1,what a poor excuse for a book,"i hate this book! Anna is sooo mean! shedoesn't know what Acorn likes. If I were her,I would just let Acorn do what he liked. He is not stupid. there would be no harm. And whats all this pony junk? I mean,come on! Ponies and horses are the same thing! And why do you measure them in hands? Everyone's hand is a different size! This book is really weird. Read it if you like,but the only part i really thought was cool was when the pony pals leaped their horses. I mean,horses aren't natural leapers like wolves and deer. It must have been tough!"
1,Poorly made,The picture on the web site masks much of the poor qualities of this shoe. The material was cheap and it looked cheap. Save your money and spend it on something else.
2,Complete Sonatas and Fantasies for Solo Piano (Dover Music for Piano),The type setting is way too small for this to very useful for sight reading. Perhaps others are OK with this..but beware. Low Price corresponds to low print quality..I should have known better. I will have to scan the pieces I am interested in and enlarge them.John
2,Slant?,I actually think the slant in this movie was toward Mary Beth-- her story seemed to get far more screen time and detail then the Sterns' story did. One thing I found odd though was the fact that Mary Beth (JoBeth Williams) had her head covered during the baby's baptism. Almost NO Catholic women still covered their heads in church by the mid-1980s!
1,One of the Worst...,"Where do you begin with this film. It is the perfect example of why ""based on a true story"" can be so misleading. This film was made before the court issues were even completely resolved and was rushed out to capitalize on an incredible and important court case. The acting is putrid and there are an incredible amount of inaccuracies. The filmmakers obviously had a slant toward the Stern's and never fairly represented Ms. Whitehead's point of view. The $2.50 they are asking for this film is $7 too much since you will have to pay shipping. Avoid this unless you love horrific B-Rated made for TV garbage."
4,Excellent and funny comic,"I've been following El Goonish Shive online for some time now, and it's nice to have the initial strips in book form."
5,All the best from The Cappuccino Kid and his entourage,"Swoon to ""You're the Best Thing,"" croon to ""Have You Ever Had it Blue,"" and groove with ""A Solid Bond in Your Heart."" All your favorite Style Council singles are here, plus a few you may not have expected (""Life at a Top People's Health Farm"", for one--I thought I was the only person on earth who bought that album). If you're coming to the Council backwards from Oasis or Paul Weller albums, or forwards from Weller's first band, The Jam, this is a great first stop. The blend of jazzy pop and angry socialist grooves (yes, somehow they were able to combine them) is invigorating, and it's not like anything you've ever heard before. Mick Talbot's swingin' keyboards keep the pace with Weller's heartfelt vocals, and lots of friends join them along the way to keep the party going. Sample one of the few bands from the early 80s who sound just as fresh today as they did back then."
5,Sophisticated and elegant-streetstyle sound,"Sophisticated and elegant, streetstyle sounds...I wouldn't call this downtempo, but it IS definately that 'perfect inbetween'. Deep and mellow grooves blended with energetic rhythym perfect for dancing or listening. The album flows, while each track is a departure from the last. Ptaah employs great percussion, creating beats both innovative and original, without being too abstract. The sound is global, yet focused...futuristic, and classic. It may take a few listens, but there are some extremely cool songs on this album."
2,Mediocre album for a mediocre movie,"1969 was the worst movie about the period that I have ever seen. Considering this movie was released in 1988, it focuses almost entirely on the vietnam war draft, and although that was the inspiration for much of the turbulence in the 60s, I felt the movie didn't capture any of its real brilliance. This was a movie about the 60s made by people who never experienced them, probably people close to Ronald Reagan. The album, along the same lines, is also worthless because it is full of cliched 60s jams, although the Canned Heat song is awesome. You are better off downloading these songs and burning them to CD, then writing ""Lame 60s mix"" on it with a Sharpie pen."
1,Virtual Turkey,"This one is a turkey that should be avoided by all but the rawest of beginners, and even for them, there is probably something better than this software. The software seems to be one or two generations behind in its technical prowess, and makes minimal use of any simulation or animation techniques. In fact, it is organized much like a multi-tiered menu of simple, mostly static instruction pages reminiscent of any decent ""learn to sail"" hardcover book. In many cases one has to click his way back up a menu in order to enter another branch. The terminology is not always standard USA, and there is no alternative vocabulary. The graphics are primitive, but that wouldn't be so bad if one could actually TRY some stated principle to see what happened. Skip this one and look for another piece of software. You can also buy a wonderful hardcover copy of Chapman's for less money!"
4,A great accessory for the Ertl John Deere tractors,"Unfortunately Amazon (in the US) doesn't sell the Bruder John Deere tractors that you would use with this trailer, however the hitch is compatible with the Ertl John Deere tractors that Amazon sells. This trailer has a great dumping action and makes the tractor twice as much fun to play with. I think that some of the reviewers claim that the Ertl tractor is diecast, but it's all plastic with construction similar to the Bruder toys."
5,Where's the DVD?!,"I haven't seen this since it originally aired, but I remember it being fantastic. I'd love to own the complete ""BB"" trilogy on DVD, but sadly, the final installment isn't available. What gives? Does Hollywood hate us? They think we won't want this just because it was made for TV? And believe me, it deserved to be on the big screen. They think we won't want it because it's sad? Um... Schindler's List is available! The arguments just don't hold water. They think maybe people aren't aware of it? Um... promote it! Besides, there are enough Neil Simon fans out there buying Brighton Beach Memoires, Biloxi Blues, Barefoot in the Park, etc., etc., so that argument doesn't cut it either. Wake up, Hollywood! This is a movie people are willing to pay money for! Release it on DVD!"
4,A riveting screenplay,"This certainly deserved to go on the ""big screen"". Everyone outdid themselves, especially near the end."
4,FCC license has noyhing to do with range,"Everyone please understands that getting the FCC license for any GMRS radio does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to increase the range of the radio. The license is a piece of paper so the FCC may track who is using GMRS frequencies, nothing more. They used to do the same for CB users in the 70's. They do not track FRS freqs because of the low output power of FRS radios. Range is affected by output power of the radio but mostly by obstacles between you and the other radio. Trees, walls, buildings, hills, etc. reduce the range considerably. A true test of range is on open water or unobstructed Line-Of-Sight from one hilltop to another. (Not everyone has a boat) Buy three different sets from different brands and try them near a lake to test, return the ones that are not to your liking."
3,Okay,"I think with ALL these 2 mile + walkie-talkie brands, the ONLY reason they DO NOT REACH their SAID RANGE is because the USERS don't GET THEIR FCC LISCENSES! THE RANGE ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAVE AN FCC LISCENSE! IF YOU AREN'T WILLING TO GET THE LISCENSE, DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WALKIE-TALKIE RANGE."
4,Helpful advice,"It was very helpful, and broken up in a way that made it easy for someone with a shot attention span to watch without losing interest."
2,too cute,"I bought this DVD thinking I would get some insight into how to be use my ADD in a more productive way. I don't think the film delivers.My guess is that this DVD has some usefulness for those who have no knowledge of ADD altogether. It was somewhat entertaining the first time around. Watching more than once was painful. The least useful & most misleading part was the segment on medications: no mention that the effectiveness of drugs eventually wears off (often sooner than later), & very little mention of how to be productive with the symptoms...no real plan on how to proceed beyond the diagnosis (except for meds).The cuteness of the film often gets in the way of the message, & it gets a bit tiring.Since the other three reviews are very positive, I see that it has some value. But my support group did not find it that valuable. Try reading ""Scattered"" by Maté for another interesting perspective."
3,Nice truck only smaller than I was expecting,This is a nice truck at a good price but it was a little smaller than I was expecting it too be.
3,Size Does it matter?,When we ordered it we thought it would be bigger. So we were a little dissapointed in the size. But my nephews still love it.
4,Great for outdoor fun,"This little dump truck is very strong. It carries dirt and mudthrough grass ,sand, and mudholes.It has survived the swimmingpool,being stood on,rolled over,buried in mud and left outside for days at a time.It cleans up easily for another dayof hard work catering to the every need of a three year old.I recommend this truck to all kids who like playing in the dirt.It's strong and is up for anything they can dish out.The truck was smaller than I first thought it would be.But it turnedout to be a great size,for a little kid."
3,Tiny little thing!,"This truck is much, much smaller than you would expect. I guess I should have known by the price but the other reviews said it was big enough to haul dirt in. Maybe a tiny scoop, but that's it. It seems well built but it's not at all what we were looking for so I'm going to have to send this one back. If you are looking for a sturdy little truck, this is great though."
4,Great Truck,"I bought this for my nephew for his birthday. It seems to be built very well and should stand the abuse of playing outdoors for years. But just to warn you, the loader made my Mighty Brute is not big enough to empty its bucket in this dump truck. I ordered both at the same time assuming that they could be used together, but apparently the designers didn't think that far."
1,terrible,this truck was very disappointing ot in barely larger than a hot wheels i had to order a real tonks truck for my son this toy was definitly not worth the money and the wheels fell off in 2 days
2,Too simplistic,I found the book too simple. Doesn't really teach anything about how to play instruments or what role does each one have in the batucada.
4,Speed Italian (4 One-Hour CDs),"Speed Italian (4 One-Hour CDs) I bought these for my husband who speaks Italian but thought he might want to brush up for our trip to Italy last May. According to him, they were worth the price. Of course, when he returned to his hometown, his Italian came spilling out as if he had never left. Now our kids are using these tapes for our next trip to Italy."
3,Some very good tracks..some duds...poor sound,"I bought the DVD and it had better sound..the downside is there are almost no complete sets of music on it, so I bought this CD for the complete pieces. I downgraded it one star for the really poor sound quality and another star because about half the pieces are either not jazz at all (Berry, Jackson) or pretty mediocre jazz (Shearing, Hamilton). The highlights are the pieces by Giuffre, Monk, Mulligan, O'Day, and Washington. I also happen to love Jack Teagarden and his duet with Louis Armstrong on Ole Rockin' Chair is interesting. The Sonny Stitt piece is pretty good..notable for the excellent jazz guitar playing of Sal Salvador."
5,Add Laughter to your DAZE,"I had the rare opportunity of meeting this author at a Writer's Conference. He is warm and witty and is the ""real deal"". Dave helps us see the lighter side of life but still through a stained glass perspective. He offers up humorous slices of life that will have you laughing out loud. Read all of the DAVE books - Boyhood Daze, Daze of Our Wives, Out on a Whim and his newest one to come in May 2002 - Stark Raving Dad."
1,very bad,They picture what they shown in Amazon and sent item is different.I suggest not to take this product.
1,bad picture,I plugged this in my HP laptop to my sharp tv...display very very blurry. Tried to configure it but still would display the same. I have not used it at all. I tried a VGA cable and it worked totally fine.
3,"Video works, but it's black and white","I don't know if it's the TV or the wires, but the video was only black and white."
4,Worth buying ..,"Worth buying, you can enjoy online movies by connecting laptop to tv using the cable."
3,"Wrong product shipped, but got full refund","I got a wrong product shipped, shippment took long to reach me.But a good thing was I returned the item because it was not that was ordered. I got the full refund including shiping charges withing a week of return"
4,Good cable,"The cable works great. Both audio and video quality is excelent.I would make a slight change making the miniplug en of the cable 15-20cm longer than the s-video, because normally on a laptop they are not in the same side."
4,Very good value for money,"I was looking for a cheap, usable product to output the VGA video sigmal and 3.5mm audio from my tiny laptop to my (OLD) 27"" RCA TV set. My TV set has one coaxial antennae port (not important in this context); and three RCA channels: Yellow (for video), White and Red (for stereo audio). So far the product has worked fine. The build quality is not great, by it gets the job done. Also the cord could have been a little longer.I would recommend this to anyone with similar needs.One thought : This is NOT a fault of the product. However after hooking up my TV, I found that I have gotten used to the much higher resolution images on my laptop screen, an didn't really use the TV much."
1,very disappointed,1) Product arrived much later than delivery estimate2) Product that was shipped was not the cable I ordered3) Picture quality with the cable is terrible.I will never again order anything from this company.
1,"Wrong item, took over a month to get here.","This was supposed to be a cable converting stereo and S-video output to RCA input. What I got was just a converter from S-video to RCA (one s-video end and one RCA end). Not only that, but it took over a MONTH to get here! I was not pleased with my purchase at all."
5,Grt service from the seller,I would say that the seller is great. At first he had sent me the wrong product but when i brought it to his notice he had instant send me the new product
3,Ideal SVideo cable for laptops,"A wrong cable was sent by the seller, but with whatever cable I received I was able to take the output from my HP laptop to my TV, however I was not able to get a color output and I am not sure whether it is my TV's limitation or it is the cable limitation."
4,Works well. Video/audio hookup. Length.,Works well. Easy to hook up.The cables to the computer are a little close together. My headphone jack is on the right side of my laptop and my video output is in the back. It's easy to pull these apart to accommodate the distance between the audio and video hook ups.I would maybe upgrade to the longer cable. 6 feet is nice but I usually play videos off my laptop and I also control them from it. So it's not very convenient to have the play/pause/etc controls not right next to me. Go for the 12 foot cable.
3,Video Resolution is poor.,Audio converts fine but the S-Video to RCA conversion is quite poor. Using one of the computer's outputs straight through is a much better idea.
5,How Can You NOT like it?,"Catie Curtis is just wonderful, and this cd is an illustration of her charm. Overproduced? Glossy? I don't think so... I've actually seen her perform these songs live and I just don'think a person could put any more emotion into their songs. This is an excellent CD!"
5,truth from lies is great too,"Even though it has yet to be released, I have a copy of Catie Curtis's Truth From Lies..And it is just as awesome as her first CD....So, everyone will be as lucky as I am now, and finally be rewarded with her new cd in Feb...Best wishes!"
2,Sadly lacking in good material.,"I have nothing but admiration for Curtis, her songwriting talent and refreshingly honest voice. But honestly, I haven't been able to find one single inspiring tune on this CD. If you're new to this artist, skip this one and buy one or both of her earlier albums. This one's plagued with B material, a studio full of formulatic musicians and Curtis' heart totally absent from the project."
5,Catie Curtis is freakin' amazing!,"Well... I'm not really a hotel clerk in Jersey, but I could be... if it meant I got to be Catie's soulmate...I own all three of Catie's CDs,and I love all of them dearly, but this is, by far, my favorite! I have owned it for over two weeks, and haven't taken it out of my CD player yet! Not only has she grown as a singer, but as a songwriter too. These songs speak to me on a much more personal, but somehow universal level, than her earlier songs do. I always find it freaky when singers write songs that apply exactly to my life, and that is exactly what Catie has done (with songs like Fall Away, I'll Cover you, What's the Matter, and Magnolia Street) in A Crash Course in Roses. Buy it! You'll be tickled pink! Well, at least, I was... :)"
1,Poor 2-way-radio choice,"I bought a pair after losing an older T5200 (also from Motorola) which is not manufactured anymore. I figured that the new & more expensive model (which also has 1 Watt compared to 1/2 watt of the T5200) should work as good or better.I was very disapoointed. Very poor sound quality. Audio is not clear and in many cases has breaks. I still have one T5200 left (I lost 1 out of 2) - eveyone in my family wants to use the older unit as the new T5820 does not perform. Plus, I paid for the T5200 half of what I paid for thr T5820...I recommend not to buy this product. Go for the new cheaper & better T5720 (1 Watt as well, compact, great sound quality. The only limitation - no vibration alert. See my review on it)."
1,Big Mistake,"Rugged outdoor use ?? I don't think so. The first day, both belt clips broke! Replacement isn't an option because the...plastic that is poorly designed will break again. Five mile range ? The radios that I purchased won't transmit over a 1.5 mile range. Finally, be prepared to send lots of money to the FCC. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
1,Poor sound quality,"We like to listen to audiobooks in the car. The sound quality on this was very uneven, making car listening extremely difficult and unpleasant. Can I return it?"
5,Just so stories,This book is very imaginative and funny. I would recommend reading this book to a young child as a bedtime story.
3,"Mostly there, but missing things","Being a free Kindle edition, I was expecting that the drawings and their attached descriptions would be missing. What I was not expecting was for the little poems often found in the stories to also be missing. Things like the Sloka the Parsee sings after the Rhinoceros eats his cake, that are usually block-quoted and italicized in published versions, are not included. The stories can certainly be followed without them, but as the text that IS there specifically says a little poem or song is going to be related to the reader, the gaps are quite obvious."
1,No Images or Poems in this version!,"This version does not contain the images or poems in the original -- one of the ones at Gutenberg does. Since some of the fun of this book is in the convoluted captions of the original drawings, I'd recommend getting that one instead."
5,A true classsic,I had a paperback copy of this book. This is a true classic nicely presented with the author's illustrations.
1,Poor Print,Wow this was poorly printed. No illustrations and looks like it was printed directly off the internet. Do not buy unless you are anticipating poor quality!
5,The grandson is captivated by the stories!,"Like myself as a child, my grandson is absoluted captivated by these classic Kipling tales. He'll sit attentively for hours as we read the stories to him. So much more mentally stimulating than cartoons or children's movies and timelssly writen by a master of the writing trade."
4,Creative and Entertaining,These are very interesting and creative stories. They seem to have roots in oral tradition and myths and fables passed down through generations. The style does show its roots in Kipling's living in Bombay.
2,Just So Storie narrated by Boris Karloff,"I had the record when I was little and loved it, but I was disappointed with the CD. The sound quality on the CD is poor. There is background static and it sounds as if he is too far away from the microphone and that he is speaking through a tube. You have to turn it up in order to hear clearly. This alone hurt our ears then Karloff emphasizes certain words quite loudly which really hurt our ears."
3,"More pics, please","My children so loved the Rikki Tikki Tavi video--based on a Kipling video--that I wanted to find other Kipling stories on tape (besides the Jungle Book). I wasn't successful, but I found many different editions of Just So Stories. It was hard to choose!I'm disappointed with the outcome. While it's a nice, full collection of the stories, there is only one illustration per story--not at all like the picture-rich edition I had as a child.To shop online for kiddy books (my children are 5, 4 and 3), it's important for it to be vivid how picture rich the book is (or isn't)."
1,sound problems,"The sound on the CD was so low, it was hard to hear even if you push the volume up to the limit"
1,Audio Track is too quiet,"I purchased this new for my classroom. Unfortunately, the audio track is so quiet it is of no use to me. I can't return it because I opened it."
2,Sound Quality Poor,"Nice packaging and collection of stories but it sounds like Boris Karloff was in a shipping container bound for Taiwan when he recorded this. Its sound is metallic, echoey and some of the quiet parts are so quiet they are almost unintelligable. Try another sound version and you might be happier with these fine stories."
4,Great stories ... when you eventually hear them,The stories on the CD are really fun and interesting. However the CD is recorded so softly even with full volume on my laptop I am not able to hear it. When it is being played in the car the volume has to be way up.That is my only complaint with this purchase.
4,Another fine edition of a classic collection,"What's not to like about Kipling's Just So Stories? This classic should be a must read, as the tales may just turn into myths: eg) How the Camel Got His Hump and The Crab That Played With the Sea. Best for read-alouds, the reader (parent) may ignore the lengthy superfluous identifiers of the pictures. Story illustrations are black woodcuts, to which the author makes many references to the fact that he wasn't allowed to produce the illustrations in color. This becomes a tedious lament to the modern reader, who appreciates different media. The best thing about this edition is that it's lightweight, portable, attractive, and the paper and text make it easy to read. The disadvantage is the glued binding which tends to crack. Interestingly, this edition contains an Author File, Who's Who in the Stories, Some Things to Think About, Some Things to Do, Did You Know, and a Glossary."
5,Fanciful and Imaginative,"My mother and I used to read the Just So Stories to each other when I was a child, and I have very fond memories of both the story, and the time spent with my mother reading these stories. Over the years, the book was lost, and I was excited to purchase it and received it recently. My favorite story is The Cat That Walked By Himself, and that was the first story I turned to when I received the book. I think every parent should buy this book to read to his or her child."
1,Worst book I have ever seen,"I don't know if Amazon actually vets any of the books they sell from small publishers (if the company that puts this out can be called one). What this version of Just So Stories turned out to be is someone copying information off the internet, not bothering with formatting and printing a continuous book without even breaks between stories, introductions and even repeating lines at times. This was the biggest waste of money ever! Do not buy this version of the Rudyard Kipling Just So Stories. I will never get anything else from this ""publisher"". Amazon should pull this listing."
5,Great Children's Book!,"These cleverly written stories are what I read to my two girls at bedtime. Short enough to hold their attention but with a moral at the end make it worth the reading time for both them and I. With titles such as ""How the Rhinoceros got his skin,"" and ""The Beginning of the Armadillos"" it introduces children to a creative thought process. Each chapter is a story, start to finish, and each is only a few pages. Love love love. Would read alone even without my 7 yr. old and 4 yr. old audience."
2,The quality lives up to the title,"The production of this fine collection of stories is ""Just-So."" I expected more from an MP3 recording. The stories themselves are fine... but the hissing? Try a different version perhaps."
3,Beware of reading this to young children...,"This book was precious to me as a young child. I enjoyed it immensely and looked forward to sharing it with my children. Not sure if my parents ""edited"" when reading, however, I was shocked to find the ""N"" word in several stories. I know that this is classic literature ~ just be warned.Also, several stories contained a great deal of violence. Characters spanking and hitting one another... save it for your older children or when you are ready to have discussions with your children about these matters."
2,Just So Racist!!,"""Oh, plain black's best for a nigger"" from ""How the Lepard got his Spots""....need I say more??I was very disappointed with this book after so many of the reviews were positive. Let's wake up!! It's 2007 and the Era of the word ""Negro"", or as Mr. Kipling likes to say...""nigger"" is not a charming word to describe an African/black person! Why don't we keep these types of books in a special section on racist authors, and what not to spend time reading to our children!!"
3,"Not Great, Average","I bought this for my 2.5 year old. The white part is metal, which is a plus. The turning handle fell off after 6 months of light use, but it was easy enough to Crazy-glue back on. My son enjoys it among his other construction equipment toys."
1,Avoid this toy!,"Few things to consider so you stay away from it1. the opening to mixing area is big/small enough to get the hand of your little one stuck in there...2. the plastic material is brittle so on day two, of indoors, easy playing with it by my son, the front bumper broke resulting in a sharp edgeafter these two, its next stop was out the door... wasn't sure if it was straight up garbage or on to the blue recycling bin"
4,Good price but not all steel.,I bought this for a gift and it seemed nice. My only complaint is the front cab and other components are made of plastic when I expected it to be all steel.
2,The Confidence Man,I tried this book thinking that I should get into more of the 'classic type'. Enough.I found it very difficult to follow and too much trouble for an entertaining read.
2,Melville takes a plunge!,"We all know and love Melville for ""Moby Dick"", but this book exhibits no such greatness. The devil is appearing in diffent guises on April Fool's day on the ship Fidele, a story that had a lot of potential for greatness. Sadly, the ""Confidence Man"" (Satan) uses the same routine over and over, and he is far from fiendishly clever. Certain passages contain interesting symbolisms (like Emerson and Thoreau being depicted as novel characters), but as a whole this novel is a failure."
1,Horrible and overrated,"This is like a precurser to the Beat movement of the 1950's. The sentences are overly long, it's written like a police report so you become overly aware that there is a narrator which takes much away from the telling of the story. The characters are not interesting and the story is boring."
1,My son hated it,"My son needed this book for a class in college. He hated it. When he tried to sell it back to the university, they stopped using the book. Nuff said."
1,Not the volume the image represents,The image of the book on the web is that of the Northwestern University edition. Open the contents on the web page and you get the H. Bruce Franklin edition. The edition supplied is neither. It is a hard bound reprint without the scholarly material offered by Northwestern or Franklin. Amazon does a poor job of delineating between editions.
1,Very difficult read,This book was written in a language and style which I found completely boring. I decided before the first half of the book was over that I could no longer continue to read it! How can this be considered a Classic?
5,Can go wrong with free Kindle texts,"I love old books, and was pleased to add this one to my collection for zero cost. Can't quite say I've read it yet, but I need to review it so that Amazon takes it off my ""Review This Please"" list."
2,YOU CAN'T REHEAT A GOURMET DINNER,"For years I've been waiting for Mayall's Album ""Back To The Roots"" to be released on CD. Finally I saw many of the songs from that album on a CD. I was especially happy to see Accidental Suicide and Television Eye on this CD. When I listened to this CD, I was horrified to hear that Mayall redid his vocals as well his piano and harp tracks on most of the songs that appear on this CD. Not only that, there were new drum tracks added as well. The adulteration of these songs was a terrible surprise for me. I hope that the original album ""Back To The Roots"" will be available on CD very soon. You can't reheat a gourmet dinner just as you can't reheat classic music."
4,THE SAXON SHORE,"I started reading Jack Whyte's novels recently after having read Robert Jorden's books and i am pleasantly surprised at the depth of characters, the intriuging storyline, and the beautifuly woven blend of fantasy and history.A must for fans of Merlin and King Arthur; Its a sublime read."
2,Very ordinary,"I'm astounded by those who rate this book five stars. Whyte has created an interesting approach to the Arthurian legend in placing it within a remnant of Roman Britain but the writing is at best ordinary and, at least this particular book, needs significant editing. (At over 700 pages this one just drags on and on.)I keep reading the series because I enjoy variations on the legend and Whyte may have created something more historically ""accurate"" than any of the other authors but I don't recommend The Saxon Shore to anyone other than Arthur junkies. Certainly reviews here that claim this is five star literature are overblown."
4,"EXCELLENT, GREAT, FANTASTIC","I am an avid Arthurian reader and this is one of the best series yet. I like the historical approach instead of the fanciful that this series and this latest book offers. Let's get to the next one Jack, you've got me on the edge of my seat."
3,Arthurian Junkies,I have enjoyed these books although they have a recipe that is a little heavy. Anyone who is addicted to the Arthur / Merlin stories might enjoy these as well. They do offer another [yet] perspective on that great enigma. That probably won't deter anyone who is a junkie. What is it lacking ? A little of the Magic I think so it doesn't rate as highly as the Cornwall stories nor some of the others. On the other hand it tries to give one a sense of the times as they actually were and does that reasonably well.
2,Most tedious so far,"I'm sorry...the previous books in the series were interesting history, had me curious as to how Whyte would work the Arthurian legend in, and were exciting...while still leaving me with the impression that this was an author in serious need of an editor (the loss of 100 or so pages from each wouldn't have been missed).Sadly, at over 700 pages, this one could lose about 500. Every time the action and plot seem to be about to catch their groove, instead we get...nothing. Lots of ideas that lead nowhere in particular. And I know Whyte is keeping it readable, but do we really need Arthurian characters approaching each other with a ""What's up?"" Bleh.This one was certainly the dullest by far, with little payoff. I'll probably give another one in the series a try, but it will be awhile."
1,The Great Train Wreck continues...,"I have to wonder to myself why I even bother to continue reading this man's work (see my previous reviews of the earlier volumes). If he wrote purely as fantasy the world would pass him off as a hack, but as a writer of historical fiction he should be drummed out of the club. Has the man never read even the basics of Celtic culture? Surely with all the hundreds of books available on the subject he should be able to find something! His knowledge of the era is fascinatingly scanty and he fills it in with such wild speculation that one is tempted to believe tha aliens are at work. The plot, once again, happens -- there is no reason for anything to happen, but it happens anyway. The characters are caricatures. The relation to the Arthurian legends is even scantier then the relation to history. This man is an awful writer. Camelot 3000 is more plausible than this tripe."
5,It gets 5 big ones from me!,I found this book to be utterly fascinating. There has been so much smoke blown about Armand Hammer over the years (a lot of it from the mouth of the Hammer himself) that it is refreshing to read a less worshipful account. The best part (and the part of Hammer's life which he purposely obscured over the years) is about his life in Russia in the 1920's. Well worth the time!
5,Has to be read to be disbelieved.,"You know that ""truth is stranger than fiction"" because fiction is limited by our imagination. Here, author Epstein, provides a captivating biography of Armand Hammer - a con's con. Hammer pulled ""all the stops"" in a brazen existence of deception that is way beyond what can be imagined by all but the most cunning connivers. Crossing even blood and family members, Epstein's true chronicle of Hammer far surpasses anything of the mass media fictional yarns or true, related stories of the same ilk. Exceptionally well-written and very difficult to put down: most readers will find Hammer's m.o. incredulous and not being able to wait to see what happens next. In short, a great biography and required reading for sensitizing to business hypocrisy."
5,Great work of historical signifigance,"I rate 5 stars on a book perhaps but one out of a hundred times. This is that work. Clearly 5 stars. Close to being on a par with ""Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr"", the award winning historical masterpiece of J.D. Rockefeller by Ron Chernow. Dossier climbs into the difficult and winding complexities that marked the amazing complexities of Armand Hammers life. Although it doesn't make my top 100 books of all time list, this is still a must read by any thinking individual whom often was left shaking their head wondering about the rapid rise out of nowhere to become the well entrenched 8th sister: Occidental Petroleum Company. That the evidence leads to Hammer actually being a Soviet agent only makes for a thicker plot."
2,A mediocre biography of a terrible man,"Moderately engrossing, this book could have been a far better and accurate assessment of a man's life if the author had had a more balanced approach and not such a jealous crusade to completely anihilate."
2,"Poorly written study of a fascinating, corrupt man",How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject! This book is a tragic waste of wonderful material. I hope that another biographer with greater literary skills decides to take on Armand Hammer.
1,This book should be classified under Historical Fiction,"This book is one goofy rumor after another. With hardly any verifiable sources, Epstein goes crazy throwing out every possible conspiracy idea around. He actually states that Hammer financed Al Gore's college education, and that the whole Gore family were his servants. If you love the ""X Files"" you will love this book."
3,Mild scrub,Mild scrub not a ton of product... Good for once a week. Not their best product for the price. Probably would try one of their others instead
2,Not for the advanced dancer,"This dvd is more suited to the beginner with very little knowledge of the dance and is a good starter to get dancing.For the advanced dancer, it a dvd that tends to be watched once and left in the cupboard or to give away."
5,Fine instructional manual,"The book is very thorough in procedures for building a wood/canvas canoe. The author explains in detail the process from start to finish and has very detailed photos depicting his process. Unless you have previously studied boat building, you may have a hard time understanding the plans included at the end of the book. The drawings are complicated and require a bit of forehand knowledge. Fantastic book for anyone interested in building their own canoe."
4,"good for the most part, but could be better.","i love built to spill, always have. the problem is, i've never liked live albums. it always seems like a ""had to be there"" affair. this album doesn't feel that way because the production is so good. really. i'm sure you've heard the songs, as most people who buy this will know who built to spill are, so i won't talk about what songs are good. the only complaint is that it could use more early material. oh well..."
2,Is It Live Or Jane's Addiction?,"Built to spill sounds a lot like Jane's Addiction, a bit too much, really. They are loud, they are screechy, they are grating. If you like this sort of wailing hard alternative, why not stick with the innovator? Leave the imatator to rot."
5,great introduction to maps and globes,"Written for 7-10 year olds, this colorful book introduces young readers to the basics of maps and globes, such as a map's uses, direction, the equator, scale, legends, latitude, longitude, elevation and the difference between physical and political maps. Illustrations are simple, colorful and informative.Well done."
4,Little too young.,it was just a little bit too young for the Grandchild I bought it for. But overall it was nice.
1,Worst Singer Ever!!!,What can I say? She sucks. She needs to get help and so does the people who buy her albums. Save your money.
4,works well,Bought a couple years ago. Works well. bought another one. I recommend it. no compliants other than the ridiculous shipping charge which was just as much as the battery per battery. but still was less than I would pay else where for one battery.
5,"Exuberant, beautiful","I doubt that Vivaldi's been played with this much exuberance and delicacy since the 18th century. A great collection of concerti beautifully performed and recorded. Andrew Manze and the Academy of Ancient Music have outdone themselves. If you love baroque music this is a great disc for you, if you're not sure this is a great place to start."
4,Nice and Vibrant !,"Revive, enliven,and invigorate your soul with this cd. Vivaldi is always as auspicious as Mozart. Rarely can you go wrong with either. Crisp and refreshing comes to mind when I hear this cd. Good sound quality, tempo, and playing ! These pieces are configured parsimoniously and arouse with creative instrumental eloquence !I have most everything Vivaldi composed instrumentally. The day you feel much of Vivaldi starts to sound the same, it is time to start investing in Tartini.You may already have some of these tunes from the complete 12 concerti Opus 8, which includes the Four Seasons.God day!"
1,Simply Godawful,"Put this one on your must-avoid list. It doesn't matter what price they charge for this turkey, it would be too much. It's a total wash from start to finish. The graphics are laughingly bad, and the vehicle physics...well, WHAT vehicle physics? Your ATV moves like it's glued to the ground, and there are no spills no matter how fast you run into something. There is a variety of play modes, but all of them are repetitive and boring. Stay away!"
1,Get a demo first,"I downloaded a demo of this game before I was going to buy it and it [is bad]! The atv does come off the ground but not very much , and try to imagine the worst possible arcade racer, and you know how when you steer it is extremely jerky well thats how it is in this game pretty bad. Search for the demo first if you like that then buy the POS!"
5,Breath of Fresh Air!,"In these difficult economic times and political times, Joy has written a powerfully uplifting book.Take charge of your life!Start now by chaning how you think and behave - all of the tools you need to be successful are already in your possession."
4,Great reading,"Great book to read to keep your on track of your goals. Author hit home on many issues about my life, and I related to what she said. I enjoyed this book, its a keeper."
1,Ruined by producer's poor judgement,What the hell is a standup bass doing on this cd? Why do some producers feel compelled to ruin the music by introducing inapprpriate and irrelevant noises? The Kora is a very very DELICATE instrument. Mixing in a standup bass on this cd is just a bad idea. The fact that the bass player is a terrible one makes it even more aggravating.
3,Fine toy. But customer service isn't easy.,"My son is a great fan of Bruder trucks, though they are expensive enough that we have very few. This combine harvester is all that my son asked for this Christmas, and he is thrilled to have it.He opened it this morning and a wheel was missing from the trailer that drags the combine when not in use. The Bruder website is not set up in such a way that one can easily contact customer service for a replacement part.We will not return the defective harvester because my son won't want to part with the toy he wanted more than anything else. I would have expected better quality control from Bruder--the missing wheel is easy to detect--and also better and simpler ways of contacting them in a situation such as this."
4,MERCURY YEARS PART 1,"In 1975, this was the first Thin Lizzy album I ever bought. I had been hearing a catchy tune called ""It's Only Money"" and I had to have it. The album totally caught me by surprize; as the band was quite good. This album would make me a Lizzy fan for life, but, I have to admit, the way they continually put out choice material helped a lot.Back to this release, there are a number of very good songs here, including, ""Still In Love With You"", ""Showdown"", ""Sha La La"", and ""Dear Heart"". This release is where the twin guitars of Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson began the trademark that would mark the band throughout their career no matter who the guitarists were. As with most Thin Lizzy albums, there is a bit of Irish music, ballads, and, of course, some hot rockers.Whether you are just looking for a taste of 70's rock and ballads, or, the turning point in a bands career, or just need all of Thin Lizzy's work, this is a must! The price here makes this disc all the more attractive..."
3,Classic or Dud?,"I'm a big big Thin Lizzy fan. I have just about everything andso having said that, this album is not a classic nor is it asbad as some say. If you like Lizzy you should like most of thesongs on it. It does have some great songs as Fighting did andI say it's a must for the real rock fan. It's better than if youlisten to classic rock radio that plays the same garbage bythose so called great rock band of the 70's that nobody couldcareless about. Look on ebay how much Lizzy stuff there is. Ithink they are more popular today than in the 80's. Glad to seeI'm not the only one still into the great Thin Lizzy! Live on!"
2,"Not one of their best,but worthwhile for early material.","This should not be measured against the band's best material,but rather looked upon as a step towards the fine mid 70's output.The studio version of ""Still in love with you"" (later to become a live favourite)makes it's first appearance here with Frankie Miller guesting on vocals.""She knows"" is probably the next most memorable track , epitomising a softer side to the band's work which was to become increasingly scarce as the decade proceeded."
3,Another step in the evolution of Thin Lizzy,"The evolution of Thin Lizzy is one of the least looked at phenomonon in Rock history. How did the band go from a funky, folky Eric Bell single guitar (and very good too) band to the great sound of the twin guitars of Lizzy. This album is the missing link of that evolution. As mentioned by many other capable reviewers, there are some jazzy soft songs and a few rockers - Philomena combines both and is the best song on the album. The main question is how did they move from this album to the Fighting/Jailbreak era of major chord guitar rock solo's and driving lyrics?I wish we can find out where Nightlife came from as it really doesn't fit in the Lizzy line-up."
3,Track Listing,"Side One1 She Knows Gorham, Lynott 5:122 Night Life Lynott 3:573 It's Only Money Lynott 2:474 Still in Love With You Lynott 5:385 Frankie Carroll Lynott 2:02Side Two6 Showdown Lynott 4:317 Banshee Lynott 1:268 Philomena Lynott 3:429 Sha-La-La Downey, Lynott 3:2510 Dear Heart Lynott 4:31"
3,A mediocore Thin Lizzy album,Nightlife is a mediocre album from this irish/british classic rock band.this happens to be one of the softer albums compared to most of their blues rock albums.this is a album of thin lizzy completists.
1,"Very poor, wrong films wrong dates, bad collection.",I was expecting better when I ordered this. It is totally unacceptable as a film history of the forties--it's like someone dipped into a barrel of fims--or academy award winners--and made a list. There are so many fine films of outstanding merit missing in this collection I dumped my new copy into the junk bin
1,That's right...more copying!,"Can you believe they did it again? Para empesar este grupo tiene como treinta años, PERO CON EL NOMBRE!!!! Es como que los Tigres del Norte cambien completamente de musicos, y llegen a celebrar el 140 Aniversario! Como que no, verdad? Los Horoscopos tienen muy poco tiempo con las dos vocalistas orribles frente a la luz. La mas orrible, Vicky, se siente que es Mariah Carey y se avienta unos gritos super chocosos al fin de las canciones. Que no save que se mira y escucha como hombre? No mal gasten en este disco. Mejor pidanle a sus tias o abuelitas que canten mientras ustedes le pegan a una casuela. Los resultados serian los mismos!"
1,Calling it CRAP would be too nice....,"This is the biggest waste of time, paper, ink, etc. I have ever seen. I only read 4 pages and threw it away....which is exactly what you should do with your money in case you are thinking about purchasing this piece of crap between two covers. Thankfully I didn't purchase this book, because if I did, I would demand my money back, plus compensation for psychological distress. I am glad that I am not the unfortunate person married to this loser."
5,Where is space for the sixth star?,"This is a great remix compilation from KoRn! Even though some of the Make Me Bad Remixes sound the same, they are all great. If you have to buy a great import, this is it! BUY IT!"
5,MaDe Me BaD,"This is deffinently a good buy, although some of the tracks on it like Make me bad (kornography mix) seem more techno than the usual KoRn style it is still a worthwhile buy but is mostly recommended for KoRn fans who already have every KoRn item available and want this for a collectors item. It would also have been better if there was a better track instead of Dirty but i gave them 5 stars because no matter what, KoRn will always be the best"
2,KoRn is amazing - but remixes aren't,"Issues is one of the best albums out right now. It has amazing guitar riffs, deep vocals, and is so much more mature than the other KoRn albums. But Issues, not the singles. The reason is that the singles are filled with remixes that simply aren't as good as the real song. Replace the amazinng riff found in all KoRn songs, add a techno beat, and you have a remix. Definitly not worth the money. Get the real album instead"
2,They ran Out Of Steam...and Money...and Promotion!!!,"It's such a shame that this album was not up to standards like its 2 predecesors, but there are reasons for it. One....no major Label support,its on a indy label & the production lacks severly! Two...loss of original drummer (replaced by Simon Wright of AC/DC-DIO fame), three..loss of orginal bass player.Its just not what the 1st two alubums..are...Hell, The second effort is no where near the Classic Quality of the 1st in my opinion..but it still rocks! if you want rhino bucket..buy the 1st..its expensive on here because its out of print..but I have ben lucky enough to find several copies at Flea Markets of all places..for $5.00 a pop."
1,Quality of Bruder Toys,I was lead astray by the comments of others on this product. Tonka no longer makes a metal outdoor construction truck other that the dump truck so in reading reviews I was really impressed with all the talk of these are well made plastic but can take the punishing play. Well I will not buy nor would I recommend any of the bruder line of trucks. They are just plastic and with that very brittle plastic. My Grandsons were so excited when they unwrapped their new trucks at Christmas now not 2 month later they are falling apart. These toys are not cheap and in my opinion should last longer than 1 month and 14 days.
3,Fossil Mollusk Of Florida,Dr. Petuch is an example of one of the best research scientist of today. His work continues to bring forth the much needed descriptions of many new species of fossil shells being found in Florida. I am glad there is someone out there that is finally putting these species in their right order and placing them in the right geological frame work. Thank You Dr. Petuch.
1,The worst toy ever,I hated it it doesent even work i turned it on and all i herd was static!!!!! Dont waste your money on something cheap. So take my advise PLEASE.
1,Very disappointing!,"We have used Motorola FRS 2-way radios for a while and we've been very happy with them except we'd like a little more range so I ordered these radios to try the GMRS channels. I carefully read the instructions and my wife and I decided to try them out. We were disappointed because the sound quality is very poor and the range doesn't seem to be much better if it is better at all!. It appears that the speaker in this radio the problem. When listening to the old radios to someone using the new radios, the sound quality is good but when listening on the new radios (The GMRS radio) the sound quality is very poor and we are repeating our messages a lot. We might try to use them with earpieces to see if we there is any improvement in the sound, if not we'll try to return these radios.Don't by these radios unless you want to repeat every message several times!"
1,Horrible writing,"The good news: great photos, excellent design. The bad news: absolutely atrocious writing. Pointless captions for every photo. The author states the obvious, gives a tiny bit of background info, raises questions he never answers, and finds a way to say ""par excellence"" to describe every other knife in this book. Reading this book is like standing next to a guy at a party who jabbers away for three hours and never says anything important. But the photos really are quite nice."
3,Its ok,"I still use it once and a while. But I prefer my 6"" folder, the Ti-Lite by Cold Steel.It has a great lock, but the blade dulls easily and is almost twice the cost as the Cold Steel"
3,Not quite as advertised ...,"I like the blade design and internal bolsters but the""lightning fast opening"" depends on your wrist action. It is NOT an assisted opening knife as one would assume from the description. It is, however, a more sturdy model than the SOG Flash II. Another bit of a disapointment are the sharp edges around the openings in the handle. I had to file these down to make a comfortable grip for hard use."
4,Big Sharp Blade!!!,"This is an awsome blade. Extremely sharp right out of the box. I only gave it 4 stars because it is binding a little in the open position making it difficult to operate the ARC lock after the blade is flicked open. I also purchased the SPEC Elite II and it does not suffer the same issue. I suspect with frequent use and practice it will go away. Other than that, this is a devistating and intimidating defensive tool in the right hands. Love it!!!!"
1,This and the 1st. Under Seige are the Most Horrible Blu-Ray Transfers Ever,"Stick with the standard DVD. The Blu-Ray has much more grain on it than the standard DVD. It's a great movie, but the worst excuse for a Blu-Ray I've ever seen."
3,Above the laws of common sense,"Steven Seagal who seemed to be in better shape here plays Nico, a cop with a bad attitude who bucks the system to put an stop to a iliegal CIA drug running operation in Chicago. The action is good and the fighting sequences are well staged especally the fight in the grocery store. But this was the first of many of Segal's films that litterey have him look like he's indestrcuble, of course he's not. The villan Zagon(played by Henry Silva) was effective but in the end he could not help to be turned out like a cartoon character, doesn't make any sense how you can be tied up, beaten, druged up and still have enough strengh to break free kill everyone in sight and walk away in a bloody mess. Only in a Seagal film this absurity can happen. But it still remains one of his better films if you can see any difference from ABOVE THE LAW to any of his other films."
4,Good action movie.,"This is not just a good Seagal movie, it's also a good movie. One of his best.Go Nico!!!"
3,Movie not aging well...,"Sure he is badass in the few fight scenes, but the rest of the movie lags and sputters along. Many of the action scenes aren't even as good as any nineties police drama. Someone outta re-edit this and tighten up the pacing; there's a good 30 min. movie that can be salvaged outta this. Oh, and the ambient soundtrack makes Lethal Weapon sound good; yuck!"
4,"Political Intrigue, CIA Ties, and Aikido Master on the Hunt","Steven Seagal's first movie, and many may still argue his best. I don't know why, but I got on a Seagal review kick tonight, and well, this movie started it all. I'm not much into sophist conspiracy theories (preachy plot), but the action is great and although light on Aikido action, it was the first time in a major motion picture that these skills were brilliantly portrayed. Andrew Davis handles silly dialogue well and keeps the pace going.Strong performances abound from Pam Greir and Henry Silva. But Seagal is the star in his debut and for the next four years, riding on the coattails of this movie, he becomes a bankable star, only to blow it by gaining a lot of weight and making substandard movies (his directing disaster is ""On Deadly Ground"", a stupid movie that would later prove he shouldn't direct movies or write scripts)."
4,Solid 80's action,"This was a solid action movie directed by Andrew Davis and is arguably Seagal's best movie, showcasing his Aikido ability quite effectively with a decent supporting cast."
3,A GOOD ACTION MOVIE,EVERYTIME THIS MOVIE WAS ON TV MY HUSBAND HAD TO SEE IT. NOW THAT I GOT IT ON DVD HE CAN WATCH IT ANYTIME HE WANTS.IT SURE HAS A LOT OF ACTION AND OF COURSE ITS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN FROM STEVEN SEGAL.
1,Save your yourself,"Don't bother with this movie. Save your time and money. Plot was hokey. At points the plot of the movie tried to be serious, other times it tried to be comical. Tom Arnold and Segal do not mix in this poorly written movie."
1,make segal stop,some of his first movies were ok but make him stop or make him get some new ideas. All of his movies are the same. The first ones were better too. It is pointless to tell the plot because it is really basically the same as allof the others.
1,"""Below the toilet""","Any rational person would see the list of characters, laugh, and continue searching for something worth buying. This certainly isn't it. I also find humor in how most of Seagal's films have three word titles.Or as I call themOut for Justice = In for MiseryAbove the Law = Below the toiletOn Deadly Ground = On Shakey Ground (Seagal)Marked for death = Marked for discountHard to Kill = Hard to watchFire down below = [pretty accurate title]"
3,typical but decent,"It's always fun to watch Steven Seagal beat [up] 10 people at once, then start running like a 5 year old girl. Yes this is a cheesey action movie with all the usual formulas, but Seagal seems to be a better actor than people like Chuck Norris, Vann Damme, Arnold, and Sly. His wisecracking remarks are definitely better than all the stupid one-liners in those other guys' movies. This was Seagal's first movie. If you've never seen one of his movies, this would probably be the best one to star with. Also a great supporting cast like Henry Silva (what a suprise, he's the lead villian!) Chelcie Ross (Harris from Major League) Pam Grier, Sharon Stone (she can't act, but she's okay here), and those same 2 cops that are in all the other movies filmed in Chicago. (The Fugitive, Code Of Silence, etc)"
4,Better than most cheesey action movies,"It seems like half the cast of Code Of Silence reunites for this little action flick. Steven Seagal plays a believable charactor unlike most action flicks. Basically he's a cop with an attitude like it says on the cover. He's trying to track down a crime lord (well played by the always bad-guy Henry Silva) that he had a small clash with in Vietnam. Yes the plot is predictable. There are no godawful cheesey one-liners like the ones you would find in movies like Action Jackson or The Running Man. Some people say Steven Seagal can't act but he's a hell of a lot better than Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme. For fans of these type of cheesey action movies, I highly recommend this one. It's definitely one of the better ones. By the way, whatever happened to Henry Silva?"
5,If you like karate without voiceovers -- this is for you!!,Stevn Segal is just awesome. The guy is a true martial artist. The action sequences are very believable and not just a series of guys jumping around on strings. Highly recommend.
4,Segal's First And One Of His Best,"Like many bargain priced eighties Above The Law is a bare bones DVD with no features to speak of. However at 9.99 no one is going to buy this movie for the features even though a commentary would have been nice. As for the movie,Above The Law is a hands down action classic. This was the debut of one the early nineties biggest action stars Stevn Segal. The direction by Andrew Davis was tense and the fight sequences are cool. Steven Segal's first is still one of his best."
3,Seagal Unfairly Criticized As Actor,"This was Steven Seagal's first movie and pretty much summed up the way his films were going to go: marital arts-crime stories with overly despicable villains and our hero saving the women by out-fighting everyone.Jean Van Damme and others followed with the same recipe which, by and large, has been pretty successful.Before I saw this, I had read national critics blasting Seagal's acting talents but that was unfair; he's not a bad actor. It was also a surprise to see Sharon Stone playing a nice role and without makeup! That certainly changed quickly with her Basic Instinct-type persona.It was fun to see Henry Silva again. As a kid growing up in the '50s and '60s, I used to see Silva on television a lot. He always played a bad guy, and played the part well....as he still does..Overall, a decent action flick but not one of Segal's more memorable films. He make a big upgrade with his next film, ""Hard To Kill."""
3,Alright,"Pretty good movie, nothing that special, worth one watch but that is about it. Would probably recommend to people who like action movies and not much else."
4,Good if you are fishing for New bands,"I got this album for the Modest Mouse Track and wound up falling in love with some of the other bands on it. Volume All Star, Draco and a few others really caught me. I don't like every song on this album, but it does have songs I love. There are songs I hate too, but that is what the skip button on my CD player is for. Definately worth it."
5,Tim Farmer,"Tim Farmer is a hero and inspiration to everyone, including me! I have enjoyed reading about Tim's trials and tribulations throughout his time on Earth. Thank You!"
4,Not so fast please.,"This little book is filled with great quotes from famous folks around the world. It also has some wonderful letters from school kids remembering their favorit teachers. The only problem is, it reads to fast. But it sure does take you back to your own school days and priceless memories."
3,Knowledge & Teaching Quotations,"This small book is a collection of mostly short (and a few long) quotations on the topics of knowledge, teaching, and learning. About half are from ""famous"" people. My favorites include Moliere's ""without knowledge, life is no more than the shadow of death,"" Emerson's ""knowledge is the antidote of fear"" and ""life is a festival only to the wise,"" and Pope's ""men must be taught as if you taught them not, and things unknown proposed as things forgot."" The other half are quotes from children about their favorite teachers. It's probably worth another half star. I bought it to give to my nephew who's just starting to teach. It does have some inspirational quality in toto."
2,"If you're looking for a book about the breed, skip this one.","I am so disappointed with this book. I was expecting an in-depth book about the breed, with information about these dog's pecularities and how to deal with them. This book is funny, the stories and cartoons are cute, but the information is too general. There are no helpful hints for dealing with a Bassett's quirks, and the author, basically describes the breed as lazy and uncooperative, whereas, I have found my own Bassett to be a loveable, trainable playful dog. If you want a funny book, buy this one, but if you want a book on what Bassetts are like and how best to raise and train one save your money, I wish I had."
2,More of a warning guide than a survival guide,"This book provides a lot of information about this breed of dog, but fails to provide solutions on how to deal with these traits. This book heavily relies on questions posted by people on newsgroups for its content to describe how a basset hound is different from other breeds. That's fine, but it never answers any of those questions. For example, one newsgroup passage is from someone who is having problems removing drool from the walls without removing the paint, and the book just ends the topic without saying how you can do this. (By the way, from trial and error, we've discovered the Mr. Clean Magic Erasers work like a charm) This gives the whole book the tone, ""Yep, bassets do that. Isn't that cute! Get used to it."" If you're looking for a book that accurately describes some of the peculiarities of bassets, this is a good book. But if you're looking for one that provides training answers, get a quality training book and look at the newsgroups."
5,A funny and true book about this clown-like breed,"This book is a must for Bassett lovers. While it may amaze owners of other breeds, Bassett owners only can shake their heads and say ""Mine does that too."""
1,Repackaged web content,"My biggest problem with this book is that a good portion of it, at least 30-40%, is stuff available verbatim on the web. There are lengthy quotes of email discussions which are archived on the related sites, the ""email joke"" about taking pictures of puppies that I remember getting in my email at least 3 different times and can find on at least 2 web sites, and more. That in and of itself isn't that bad, but in a book of its list price, I expect some original content. I expect tons of information from the author's experience raising countless bassets. While the anecdotes are amusing, and at least part of why I bought it, they come across as a poorly organized web site: random and chaotic. If you are going to stick a price like that on a book, it had better be more than a cut'n'paste from past email discussions with a little commentary thrown in. Bottom line? Save your money and read the archives of the email discussions."
4,Good but not Great,"This is cd is good but its not great it could be better i think the best songs on here are #'s 1-5, 8, and 9. U should listenin to this cd on real player just to see if u like it or not.In closeing i thought the c.d was good...will i buy another one? no i dont think so."
4,A summary of pre-modern japan,"This book covers the history of Japan in an enthusiastic way from its early histories with the Joman dolls up to the blackships of commodore Perry. I first read this in my Japanese history course, we were required to read parts of the book as a backbone for the lectures, but soon i found that I was reading the entire book. It's actually quite a easy read and Japan's history is quite refreshing for someone who's been embraced in european histories all his life. Chapters about the Heian and warring states period (in the 16th century) are the most interesting and helpful."
4,Not what I expected,"When I purchased this book, I expected a topical history of the ways of the Old South. WRONG! This work is an in-depth sociological study of the way honor (and other areas of person) were perceived and displayed in that lost era. Not only is the exposition a shock for those who mourn for the Old South, but gives personal insight into the behavior of the region today. Excellent book - slow reading"
3,More scholarly than entertaining,"Interesting material but the treatment was much more academic and far less anecdotal than I would have liked. As others have noted, it is a slow read. The prose is very effective, but very dense and requires some effort. Perhaps it seemed more so as I had just finished several Stephen Ambrose books consecutively, and their flow is so effortless. Anyway, if I were writing a term paper this would be a natural. As someone who reads for entertainment as well as education, I found this book a little more work!!!"
2,It wasn't what I expected,"I bought this book cause it says that it has many ""terrific teaching ideas"" well I don't agree with that, I'm not sure that I'm gonna buy again another scholastic book,I'm very dissapointed with this one, think that the price is to high for this kind of book, feel like I wasted my money, they should sell it as a coloring book...sorry I don't recommend it."
3,For US students only!,"I teach English to children in France and this book has very little content geared for my needs and not worth the $12 I spent. I love to teach with mini-books that I create myself, so I was drawn to the title. However, I found the ones offered here very dull, i.e. copying number words, rather than engaging their creativity by having them illustrate the number word. Other mini-books teach the Pledge of Allegiance, This Land is Your Land, and writing the alphabet - also not appropriate for my needs. But as someone who is always looking for appropriate clip art for my lessons, I agree with the other reviewers that the illustrations are appealing and helpful for teaching basic vocabulary, and can be used in many ways."
5,Excellent,I used this book to teach 2nd graders of an Elementary school in Mexico. They loved the activities!
4,Very helpful for very beginners,"Well, I am a teacher from Oman, Middle East, where Arabic language is the official language. Actually, I liked the product because it is very useful for beginners since it has so many pictures which motivate and help the learners to understand the subjects. It has very clear instructions. The pictures are not colored which will help the teacher to use different pictures for different purposes in teaching. I can use for learners in grade 1 and 2 only.Thank you."
2,Disappointing,"I really thought this might be fun to try with students, but it came terribly disappointing. It has little more than a coloring book. You could get some flash cards and use your creativity and come up with way better than this."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a great tool for teaching the English language to native and non native learners. The approach is student oriented and is very much supplemental. I thought there would be a little more to it, for the teacher, but you have to sort of wing it. It is great for younger learners but is a simple tool that older learners (adults) can enjoy- if they just want to take a few minutes to break from more rigorous adult oriented English aquisition."
5,Excellent activities book for the new ESL teacher,This is an excellent book for doing activities with students where they learn by doing. I taught ESL for over 25 years and I have done a lot of the simple activities in this book. One thing that a new teacher doesn't usually understand is what to do with the children between intense lessons where you have taught them something new. You play games with them where they use the language skills you just taught. They think they are playing but they are learning too. Adults learn the same way. They need a breather after learning something new. They need to be able to use the language that you have just taught. Another really nuts and bolts book on teaching ESL to older children or adults is: [...]
2,Love the sauce hate the cost,"I love this sauce. Unfortunately I now live in an area that doesnt have an asian market. I came on here to order some and I thought the price was kinda spendy for so little. I used to get these all the time, in the previous place I used to live I used to get the 16.4 ounce bottles for 3.95. they sent me 2 16.4 ounce bottles instead of 4 6.4 ounce bottles, so I actually got 6 ounces more than normal but at 2X the cost. but considering shipping was spendy and it took a month for them to get here, at 25$ for 2 bottles I will never be doing this again. buyer beware, if you are looking to get some of these, its in your best interest to contact someone from another town and have them look for you, itd be far cheaper."
4,Great addition for any Sailor Moon fan!,"I was hesitant to buy these since there were no reviews but I'm glad I did. Great quality and it has many duplicates. So you could give some away because there is enough sheets. The tattoo pictures are very cute and I love them all. If you love sailor moon, I recommend this product. Fast shipping and great quality."
1,Not up to the rigors of MY 5 year old...,Bruder needs to have real kids test their toys. After a couple days in the sand box both backhoe and bucket broke off. There are also a couple pinch points that cause some tears...
3,"Great idea, Poor durability.",Disclosure ... we have several other Bruder toys that have lasted but opted to let this one go outside in the sandbox and be a test vehicle. The short version of the outcome is these toys are not made for exposure to sand. The moving joints quickly became difficult for our 3.5 year old to manuever without extra effort. A couple weeks later the front end loader broke off and appears to have not means of repair.If plan is for this to be an inside toy perhaps it will last longer.
4,As promised,"I was worried about the claims of some reviewers that this toy truck wasn't sturdy enough, but took a risk and purchased anyhow. No problems 3 weeks later, and my 4 year old son enjoys it a lot (outside in the sand pit and inside too)."
2,Way too fragile,"I bought this for my 3 year old son despite reading the reviews that it was somewhat fragile. It didn't last a week before the backhoe broke off the back. The loader didn't last much longer. It is a neat toy - it has a lot of detail and moving parts - so might be good for display or gentle play, but definitely not good for the sandbox."
4,"Pretty standard, but overall good toy","My 2 1/2 yr old son loved his yellow backhoe from Santa! He hasnt broken any of the parts on it yet, but then again he isnt super rough with any of his toys. It seems like it could be a bit more solid... It could have possibly been better if it had some noise buttons?? Great overall toy, he really likes the size, not too big, easy to pick up. I will definitely be buying another Bruder toy, they have a huge selection of any type of work/constuction/maintenance trucks and boy toys."
4,Cool Vehicle That's Identical To the Real Thing,"Length:: 5:32 MinsA review of the Bruder Loader/Backhoe. I've read in the other reviews that they have had problems with durability. We've had this toy for two weeks now and haven't had a problem. Maybe after some more rough play we will have some breaks as well, but at this point it's held up well and provides a lot of fun."
3,Should have been made of metal.,Front loader broke off after 2 weeks. It seems bruder toys are very detailed but can't stand up to real world play.
2,Disappointed - Not tough enough,"While a fun toy, this toy has already broken since my son's first used only 10 days ago on his birthday. The loader part just broke off. Guaranteed, he has been using it in the sand box and at the beach and is not exactly easy on his toys.If you want a toy for inside the house, this will work great, but if you are looking for something durable for the beach or sand box, or if your child is relatively rough on toys, I don't recommend this one.We have other Bruder toys that are much more durable than this one. So far, the yellow ""Bruder"" toys have been very disappointing in this house and do not stand up to the test of hard core playing outside."
3,Not very durable,"My son was 3 when he received it. He likes to play with it but parts of the truck fall off. For the price, I would expect it to last a bit better. (My 4 year old received a different Bruder truck and it holds up much better.)"
4,Loader Backhoe by Bruder,"The toy has been a hit with my 3 year old grandson, however the packing was very sloppy so one of the wheels was bent out of shape. We could bend it back though."
4,backhoe loader,"I bought this for my 3 year old son who is really into construction vehicles. He absolutely loved it. It went everywhere with him. Unfortunately, it did not withstand excessive use. We were constantly reattaching the backhoe mechanism until it finally completely broke off. He was totally devastated."
5,My 3 year old loves it!,"My son received this for his birthday, in the few short days he has owned it, it has held up very well. He can be hard on toys like this because he has seen my husband use the real thing and knows what it is suppossed to be able to do and has already put it to the test. So far so good!!"
4,NIce Toy,"Bought this for my 3 year old and he really likes it. It is by far the most realistic toy he has. It is fairly sturdy, but my son is pretty rough on his toys, so I'm not sure how long it will remain in one piece."
