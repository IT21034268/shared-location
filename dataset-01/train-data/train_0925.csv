2,Does 2004 MINI base model,"(edited) This tool does NOT fit the 2004 MINI Cooper base model rear brake caliper. I would return it but my car is disabled and I need to get it going, so I had to modify the tool with a grinder. A comment mentioned it works fine on the S model, which is probably due to the larger caliper size (unverified). If you're OK with grinding the tool down to fit a smaller caliper, go for it."
5,"Easy to use, excellent price","Wish I had bought this years ago, it makes pushing back any brake caliper very easy, highly recommended to anyone. For the price, keep in your garage and lend to friends."
5,Good quality product.,In my case this kit came in very handy. I was having some trouble doing the rear brake on a Volvo and one of the tools did the work. Good kit to have around the shop.
5,ABC games,"My children 2 1/2 and 5 1/2 love the video as well at the Big Surprise. They learned over 50 signs in this one video alone. They enjoy watching the videos and interacting with them. My 2 1/2year old has been going to speech therapy, so we bought him this DVD to help him learn ASL (and thus reinforce his speech therapy). Not to mentition helping us-his mother and father learn ASL. Because my son loves this DVD, he wants to watch it at least every other day, and because he watches it all the time, the signs are really sticking. Our entire family has learned a good bit of ASL, and that has made a huge impact on our son's ability to communicate. His total vocabulary is improving and his spoken vocabulary has more than doubled. Within 2 weeks of starting him with sign language he was able to sign over 100 words. We looked at several DVD's to help us with learning ASL and found Sign-A-Lot to have the most words in one video. I recommend getting both Sign-A-lot videos."
5,fun and helpful,my girls ages 2 and 3 love the DVD and would watch it several times in a row if I let them. One is hearing imapared and the other is not but both love it and learn.
1,"Si algún día me envían este disco, haré una crítica",Hace casi dos meses que lo pedí y aún no lo he recibido
4,"Not quite as good as ""Seven Up in the Soviet Union""","If I hadn't seen Seven Up in the Soviet Union, I would likely have given this five stars. This video presents interviews with children at age seven in South Africa. Children from different ethnicities and speaking different languages are presented talking about race, politics, and life. They are often disturbingly blunt with their opinions and reflect what one can only assume are their parent's sentiments regarding members of other ethnicities in the nation."
1,Mislealding product,"Was very disappointed, thought the product was boo not a VCR, I think that amazon is a little misleading on this product. I would like. To still purchase the product if it were in book or cd form. I ink it is probally a good product if I could watch it."
3,Okay,"If you are looking for a jazzy, smooth, mellow, not so trip hoppy album, then this is the album for you. Most of the songs on here sound the same, the voices aren't any thing too outstanding, and the music is nice, but not catchy. If you liked the first five songs on the album She: A Trip Hop Experience, then you will be disapointed with this album. There are no such gems on this one, no one song that really jumps out with that beautiful original greatness. This is okay for a nice ride in to car, relaxing, and just okay. Honestly myself, I wish I hadn't wasted my money though. But for others, it may be okay. But nothing when compared to the former, Massive Attack, or Hoovephonic. You won't miss anything good if you don't buy this album."
3,Not what I'd call trip-hop.,"The music featured on this album is not what I'd call trip-hop; it's much more similar to mid-90's gothic or even ""adult contemporary"" music. Think Sarah McLachlan-type stuff. I agree with an earlier reviewer that none of the songs on the album really stand out. ""Noir"" is a disappointingly mediocre and monotonous album.Amazon suggested that I purchase ""She: A Female Trip Hop Experience"" along with this item, which I did. That album was much closer to what I expect from an album billed as ""female trip-hop"". I recommend purchasing that ablum instead, if you're interested in actual trip-hop instead of featureless easy listening."
2,Please Don't,"Please Don't buy this cd. They tricked me and made me waste my money. To me this cd don't sound like trip hop at all, its more like electronica, not that i have a problem with electronica but it still sucks.Its like 2 songs thats alright."
1,Not worth it...,"What a load of outdated, monotonous, drivel. To say it's trip-hop is completely misleading and to top it all off there's only one good moment of one fair song. The rest of it? Predictable beats, blah lyrics - all in all, sounds like it was recorded with a 4-track in the back of a smooth-jazz club. Astounding that this came out of Philly but I'll tell you this, the place it was printed from doesn't exist anymore, that in and of itself has gotta say somethin'."
5,This book helps students master English.,In this book the student improves writing and speaking skills by doing a challenging ten-item exercise daily and attempting to remember elements missed. It would be especially helpful for students who want to catch up or to get ahead in their English skills and is appropriate for teenagers or adults. Students can benefit from Mr. Pike's 30 years of English teaching experience.
4,Very good C.D. Herb at his best.,Magic man is excellent.Any one who likes HERB should get this recording.It is really good.
2,Acid-Brass?,"Herb Alpert's new album is a bit of a disappointment. Here he collaborates with members of the rock group Living Colors and tries to make what sounds like acid-jazz. There are parts of this CD that's very bottom-heavy, and can blow out your speakers. He sounds rather lifeless on this recording, as opposed to his past two albums. There are some good songs on here. ""Think About It"" is the best. Nice acoustic guitars with Alpert doodling on muted trumpet, only to break into an upbeat passage. ""I Want You"" is one of his better solos, and ""Colors"" sounds like a Miles Davis tune. ""Look Of Love"" is okay, but the vocals are terrible on this. ""Dorita"" is just a bad song. ""Magic Man"" has its moments, but drags on too much. This is clearly not one of Alpert's better efforts, and this Herb Alpert fan is disappointed."
4,great set,"Great set : discs 1 and 2 (movie and jam sessions)are awesome , discs 3 and 4 are full of interviews that could be interesting if you're an art student ,critic of rock or so. Otherwise , these two are a waste of time."
3,Sorry. No liberal guilt here...,"There is NO question that Chuck Berry INVENTED Rock and Roll Guitar - PERIOD. But I tend to question the ""integrity"" of...""whoever"" when I can't obtain just the concert iself without 3 other useless CD's of Chuck Berry whining. Is this available, just the concert and no...""memories?"" I'll purchase THAT, but 45 bucks for an excellent concert and 3 useless CD's is totally out of the question. Sorry. There it is. And there IS a less expensive version of this available (from Starbucks Coffee????????????) with just the concert film and a CD of some Chuck Berry music probably not found in dillitantes collection of ""Chuck Berry Music."" Just look for it..."
2,NOPE,Too much talkin' and not enough music! The folks on the DVD need to shut up and let the must speak for itself.
2,a title I've been waiting for,I'm disappointed in the way they film-makers chose to author the deluxe set. Navigation is difficult and the 2nd disc was very difficult to get it to play. Content is good getting it off the disc is difficult.
5,Bought 6 copies altogether,I bought a copy last year. I liked it so much I just bought copies for daughter and four grandchildren. I admire Keith Richards for putting up with Chuck Berry! This was an excellent tribute by one great guitar player for another. Admirable.Oh and Linda Ronstadt's solo was tremendous! My favorite solo of disc 1.Phil Russell
5,An outing you will never forget!,"I saw the original film version together with my son ages ago in Oslo. This event, along with ""A Rockabilly Session"" (Perkins, Clapton, Ringo etc)on TV, started my son's guitar playing career! The very next day after the film I went and bought the video version of ""Hail! Hail!""!! It simply got worn out, and the release of this 4 Disc DVD box came in the nick of time! This superb film, now digitally refurbished and with all the extra material - WOW! The way I see it, it surely ranks up there among the top 5 rock documentaies of all times! Chuck Berry himself, the interplay between him and Keith Richards, Johnnie Johnson, all the fantasic guest stars, the music, the band, the interviews with even more rock legends, the stories, the action and the history - if you do not buy this box, your brain is dead and your heart is even deader!!"
5,The REAL King of Rock n Roll,"Elvis was a joke. Chuck Berry is the true king of Rock n Roll, and if you disagree, you need to watch this. his film is a who's who of rock n roll, and they all bow down to the king himself.Chuck is a one of a kind and doesn't get half the recognition he deserves. I mean c'mon already, 'Johny B. Goode' is the greatest rock n roll song ever written. That song was the spark that created what rock is today. I can understand why he is the way he is. Like he said he was just 'writing music for the white kids'. But those who are educated in rock n roll know that we are forever in his debt.The concert at the end is great with Keith Richards trying to hold everything together."
5,hail hail chuck,"this is a timeless classic. chuck berry is quite possibly the true father of rock and roll as we now know it. this movie not only shows the famous 60th birthday concert, but also includes tons of extra footage including commentary and performances by keith richards, eric clapton, and many more."
3,Only half the story,"This movie would have been great if they had explored Johnnie Johnson's role more. They started to but abruptly stopped. As everyone knows, Johnnie was the music behind Chuck's lyrics. My favorite part is when Johnnie says he didn't write the music but then goes on to explain what he did do and it was writing the music! Long live Johnnie ""B. Goode""!"
4,Worthwhile.,"The DVD's are great but they could be compatible with all world regions. Moreover, it would be nice if there were English subtitles for people with hearing disability."
4,R & R 4 disc set review,"Excellant set ( well 3 out of 4 ain't bad ) Disk 4 has a drunk Jerry Lee Lewis trying to be cute , but.... not ! Also a bunch of others talking about themselves mostly !! Disc 3 , with Chuck and Robbie Robertson gives a wonderful insight to Chuck !"
2,Fearfully and Wonderfully Made,"I purchased this book because the Sabbath School class was using it. I haven't finished reading it. I didn't like it. It was probably well written but it didn't do anything for me. The last time I was in the class, I was really depressed because I felt it was way to highbrow, intellectual and I haven't been back to the class since."
5,Wonderful,Intriguing and challenging book that forces you to look carefully both at how your body functions physiologically and at analogies for life. Well written and accessible.
4,hitachi blade,I bought two of these. One cuts very smooth the other is somewhat ragged. Quality control must not be as high as one would expect for blades this expensive.
3,Good Music / Poor production,LOUD LOUD LOUD ... and LOUD. The selection is good... but it sounds like it was recorded by a 4 year old who liked flickering red lights on the board. Shame.
3,book by Colin Fletcher,"The quality of paper is less than I expected. Having read a previous copy, I was somewhat disapointed, but glad to own my own copy.."
3,"Nice video, but audio is lame!",The Universe series made a huge mistake with audio ... just being 2.0. My God ... Star Trek Next Generation was one of the first TV shows to come out with surround sound ... and boy did that add 14 dimensions to my audio space. It probably threw in a couple more parallel universes in there at the same time. I can't understand how a great series like this is so technologically backwards ... it's just a crying shame. The only reason I can think of is they do not care what people think of their product. Outer space has such great envelopment with 5.1 audio. It's almost boring to watch knowing it could be so much better with 5.1 audio. I just hope they do not make a 3D version without including 5.1 audio.
2,The universe Season 5,"When you compare season 5 with season 2, 5 is a ripoff.Season 2 had 19 shows on 4 disk. Season 5 has 8 shows on 2 disk.It is like they just rushed through to get a season out no matter how incomplete it is.I am very dissapointed."
2,Amount of Run-Time!!!!! Content running low????,"I'm not reviewing the content of this set, but what I did notice is the amount of run-time this years series has. Just over six hours, while every other season is between 14 and 10 hours long. They show a retail price of $40.00 and selling right now at $20.00 I do like this series but it seams like the content is running out or something, being about the universe, how can one run out of material??? Anyway, I'm just stating an observation and hope someone else reads this and helps them not to buy this at full price."
1,a hat full of tah,once upon a time in a galaxy not far enough away there was a thing known as the big ban and no theory will tell you otherwise
3,They seem to be running out of ideas,"The 5th season is worth watching, but like the 4th season there is much less science and much more speculation and sensationalism. The first three seasons were really much better. Given that and the fact that there are only 8 episodes in the 5th season keep me from giving it any more than 3 stars.Still, as I said, it is worth watching. The price is reasonable, and there are a LOT of worse shows out there in the modern tv waste land that you could blow hard earned cash on."
3,I think this film is quite okay.,This film is about how we gonna to love an animal as a part of us.I think it's suitable for all.You've gonna to miss it if you don't see this film.
4,Joe,"A Disney movie about an ape called Joe,befriended by a pretty girl.It's so sad when Joe falls from a ferris wheel.Is he dead??"
4,Romance Lover,One of my favorite Disney moves. The special effects were good. I like the actors in the movie especially Bill Paxton.
5,Great movie for everyone,"Disney just keeps getting better with thier movies. The special effects in Mighty Joe Young are done just as well as Jurassic Park. I didn't think I was going to like this movie, but I rented the DVD and loved it. Suprisingly, there is a feature on this DVD which contains interviews with some of the actors. Best of all, James Horner (Titanic, Mask of Zorro, Deep Impact) composed the music."
4,A GREAT FLICK FOR EVEN THE YOUNG AT HEART,"THIS IS A GOOD FILM GEARED FOR KIDS. THE VIOLENCE IS TAME, THE PLOT SIMPLE AND THE MUSIC IS GREAT. NO FOUL LANGUAGE....IMAGINE THAT. IN TODAY'S FILMMAKING WORLD THIS INDEED IS A NICE CHANGE OF PACE MOVIE. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GOOD AND MJY SEEMS REALLY LIFELIKE. JAMES HORNER'S SCORE IS GREAT AND REALLY ADDS TO THE FILM. IF YOU GREW UP ON FILMS LIKE OLD YELLER AND SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON, AND YOU ENJOYED THEM, SEE THIS FILM WITH YOUR KIDS. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
5,wonderful family movie,"this movie was enjoyed by my whole family. very entertaining movie to watch, must see with kids. it""s a thumbs up."
4,Good movie,My grandchildren love this movie -I only had VHS. Was glad to find the DVD. A little scary in parts for young kids.
5,Mighty Joe Young,"This Mighty Joe Young, was for region 1, which does not come from the UK. It came from Movistar via Amazon, of which I do not think much of, as I found them most un-coperative, as it was a long way to send back, and was not worth the trouble, or expense, So if there is anyone out there that lives in region 1, I have one to sell, as I cannot use it at all.Margaret Fitch."
3,MIGHTY Family fun,"A feel good story for the whole family, don't expect ""Mighty Joe Young"" to knock you off your feet. Instead, watch it for the good ""Beauty and the Beast"" storyline that is well outlined for any age group to watch.There is some violence in this movie, and smaller children may be frightened by ""Joe"" at first, but if they can control themselves through the first few minutes, they'll fall in love with him. There is very little, if any, foul language.The story is simple: Girl and giant ape are moved to the city, girl and giant ape want out, man in love with girl helps, everyone ends up happy.If you're interested, ""Joe"" looks fairly realistic, especially for the time this flick was made.Overall, a good family show that all can watch. I highly recommend it for its entertainment value."
1,I'd rather swim in King Kong's crap than watch this movie,"This is awful. Simply awful. The effects on Mighty Joe Young were laughable back in 1998, and looking at them now after seeing the glory that is Peter Jackson's King Kong... no. Just... no. Bill Paxton also needs to be banned from acting. Hell, even CONGO was better than this tripe!"
5,Stunning!,"I never got to see this movie in theaters, but when I rented it on video, it was better than I thought it would be. The humor was astounding when Joe wacked Bill Paxton across the head. The Special Effects were breathtaking, especialy when the ferris wheel tipped over. The acting was great as well as the storyline. I think MIGHTY JOE YOUNG is a movie the whole family can laugh and cry about. Believe me, this movie is an edge of your seat adventere."
5,great gift,"parents had it, and I loved it. My wife wanted it, though we have dificulties in marriage, I let her have it. Since I've ordered many things from Amazon before, I know it works."
2,Great special effects but mediocre acting and characters,"Disney's remake of the classic begins with a brief tribute to RKO pictures and provides a special-effects created ape as stunning for today as the original was in its day. Unfortunately, the human actors don't keep pace with the computer and mechanically created star. There are two sensational chase sequences and some charming (tear-jecking moments). Unfortunately, the film lacks the depth and texture found in the best of films dealing with fantastic subjects (such as Jurassic Park) with the human characters more two-dimensional and less life-like than Joe."
1,Mighty Joe Young,I have yet to see the movie the reason I have not watch the movie is because the DVD did not work in any DVd player.I was told after I got the disk it takes a certain type of player in order for the movie to play. Like a non-United States made dvd player.
4,A Mighty Remake,"While the old classic is just that, a classic, this remake is far superior in every way. Theron is both stunning and a talented Oscar winner for ""Monster."" Bill Paxton is believable as always and so is the cast of familar faces. This is fun for the whole family with only some mild profanity and violence (I wouldn't let my youngest child see the needlessly graphic ""electrocution"" scene of the villian in the end). The special effects are the kind that will hold up over time and make this worth watching over and over again. My family loves this film; it has excellent repeat value."
4,WENT APE OVER MIGHTY JOE YOUNG,"SAW THIS FILM AND REALLY ENJOYED IT. THE VIOLENCE WAS TAME THE LANGUAGE CLEAN AND THE STORY LINE RIGHT ON TARGET FOR CHILDREN. WHAT NO REVIEW HERE SEEMS TO MENTION IS THE TERRIFIC PULSATING SCORE BY JAMES HORNER. HIS USE OF CONGO DRUMS ALONG WITH AN AFRICAN MOTIF REALLY ADD TO THE FILMS SUCCESS. THEY SAY THE MOVIE IS GEARED FOR KIDS, BUT IF YOU'RE GREW UP ON FILMS LIKE OLD YELLER I WOULD CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT."
4,Execellent remake of a good movie,"A rare case of where we may have enjoyed this movie more than the original. At the very least, it's a remake worth watching compared to most Hollywood re-runs."
3,Loved it more when I was younger but still great,"Mighty Joe Young was a fave of mine when I was, like, nine. Re-watching it as an adult, it's lost some of its magic and you realize how many themes/instances are reminiscent of King Kong. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong, I just remember it being better as a kid. Charlize Theron is still freakishly hot in it though! XD"
4,How to avoid the Monday blues,"Although this book has been around for a while and there are many variations on its theme, the message is timeless and well presented. Gilbert offers a zen or spiritual approach to dealing with an unhappy work environment. As a career counselor I work with lots of clients who are stuck in a job, and it just isn't practical for them to change careers. So how do you deal with it? Gilbert offers practical and straight forward advice on how to cope and even thrive in a less than satisfactory work situation...turning ""lemons into leamonade."" Warning: This book is spiritual in nature, so it may not be everyone's ""Tao of Tea."""
2,Not for me,I was looking for guidelines on how and what foods to start my infant on. I did not like this book at all.
3,Arrived broken,The globe was very nice looking but it was broken. I had to send it back; I am reluctant to reorder.
1,this book is worthless,just use the internet to learn how to reference things. this book is just chaos
2,Not the quality I expected,"I purchased this thinking Body Glove was a quality product, but after only a few months of use the interior clear plastic that covers the display screen came apart at the seams. Also, the clear plastic never seemed to stay in place while using the phone, it would always ride up and cover the receiver/speaker; you would have to either constantly push it back down so that you could hear the other caller or take it off altogether."
4,Great.,"Well this is a bias review, cause I'm a fan. but is a good cd sure it could have other songs but I'm ok with what I got."
4,Mesmerizing Thriller,"ENDURING LOVE (2004) is the most mesmerizing and unique psychological thriller that I've seen in some time.It begins with a tragedy. Daniel Craig and girlfriend Samantha Morton are picnicking in a field outside of London when they witness a freak, fatal ballooning accident. Craig and several other men tried to help prevent the death, but they were forced to let go of the balloon.Awhile later, Craig, who feels a certain amount of guilt about the accident, gets a visit from Rhys Ifans, one of the other men present on that tragic day. What Ifans wants of him is not immediately clear, but this strange man begins to stalk Craig, following him wherever he goes. Ultimately, Ifans' presence and his own growing feelings of guilt begin to destroy Craig's life, including his relationship with Morton.Directed by Roger Michell, this excellent film has a shocker of an ending.Michael B. Druxman"
3,Enduring Love,"While I really like Daniel Craig, and he did some fine acting in this movie, the story made no sense and I had a hard time following the convoluted story line."
3,disturbing...,"Enduring Love is a very good drama: well written, well directed, with excellent actors, especially Daniel Craig who's just terrific.The film is a bit disturbing because it shows how far an obsession can go and how it can destroy lives. The final scene between Craig and Ifans is unforgettable."
3,Okay,This movie was okay. Good actors and the screenplay was different. It was just okay for me. A little weird.
1,"painful, but not in a good way",This movie is tries to be profound but ends up being monotonous. I sat through it for no other reason than to find out what happened and wished i hadn't.
1,A Waste of Time,"A hapless existentialist and random stalker make for the loony bin. The acting is decent, but as the mystery unravels, it becomes clear the plot was as poorly conceived as any other stalker movie (e.g. Scream II). The main character, the professor (the new Bond), never does what you want him to do, making him predictably annoying. The unwieldy camera effects and cliche or alternatively random dialogue do not help make the movie any more convincing."
1,Disappointing recording,"I was looking forward, based on commentary on this album that I'd read elsewhere, to hearing a master at the top of his game, someone who ""was THE living master of old-style strathspey playing. It's truly inspiring to hear someone in his mid-80s playing so strongly."" Instead, I was astounded to find the recording almost unbearable to listen to. Much of the playing is frankly out of tune. I can't understand how it got released."
4,Nice alternative to a wood block,"If you're like me, and don't have any counter space to spare, this wood knife tray may be just the ticket. It's a far better alternative than just tossing your knives in a drawer loose. This not only protects your knives, it protects your fingers! My main complaint is just that it doesn't hold very many knives. 4 large knives, and 6 smaller (steak) knives is not much storage. If that's enough for you though, you should be quite happy with this holder."
4,Hello,"Everything with this product is perfect except for one thing. If you have a boning knife, the extra bit of bolster makes the knife sit at an angle in the top portion of the rack. In mine, I just have the boning knife upside down, and it does sit without the blade being above the wood, so it is safe, but not exactly ideal. If there were an extra groove or something for the larger bolster of this knife, then there would be no problems at all. You can put a boning knife in a bottom space, which would take a spot for a larger knife, and it would be fine.This product is great overall though not counting the oversight of the boning knife. It's sturdy, looks nice, and it keeps your knives from being chipped and your skin from being sliced."
3,best for manufactured reeds,"This is a usable reed for beginners, ours have tended to be flat. Hand made oboe reeds can easily be purchased from thier makers' online stores and are so much better sounding and easier to play. All for a couple of dollars more. Jones can be tweeked to be better than straight out of the tube and last reasonibly well, but in the end they simply do not sound as nice as a good handmade reed."
2,Too Much Filler,"I lived in the area at the time of these murders, and I read a lot of true crime books. I felt that the author spent too much time writing about the 'false leads' of the investigation. For a book that is 257 pages, the real killers names are not even mentioned until page 216. There was very little time spent describing the actual killers, their backgrounds, the motive, etc. I doubt that they were even interviewed for the book. This was a very frustrating book to read."
4,Great duo,I have a 1 1/2 inch hot tools ceramic flat iron but when i cut my hair real short this new flat iron was the way to go! i've had a couple hot tools because they are good and trust worthy products... The traveling thermal bag is a great complimentary gift with it.
2,Good when it works.,"The buttons stopped working on mine, too, then started again. Then, files started getting corrupted so the player would freeze and I'd have to remove the battery to reboot it. I'd replace the files and different ones would cause the problem the next time. I will be buying a different mp3 player."
1,Beware of Broken Buttons,This is a great player when it works. I love the features and sports timer. The earphones are uncomfortable but no big deal seeing how cheap replacements are. The problem is the buttons stop working. At first they seem a little difficult to push but then they just stop functioning. Two buttons went out after three weeks of use. They were the Volume down and Next Track. Returned to store for exchange and then the same thing happened again to the second unit only now its three buttons including the most important Menu button. Will need to send item in to Creative now and wait. I will not be surprised if the third one I recieve has the same problem. This issue has been brought up in the creative fourms and I have seen it reported other places on the net. If I had to do over I would not buy another one of these. Basically a little bad engineering ruined what otherwise would be a great product.
1,Well-intentioned tribute falls short,"The creators of this Laurel and Hardy ""relaunch"" intended to film a 1990s tribute to Stan and Babe. Unfortunately, it is too 1990's: the action/slapstick is frenetic and loud, hardly the subtle and inventive style of the boys' primary creative talent, Stan Laurel himself.The actors do a fine job, unfortunately the film doesn't allow them to showcase their talent. It's too bad that a biography-type film with recreations of classic Hal Roach scenes wasn't attempted. Bronson Pinchot and Gailard Sartain could have turned in wonderful performances.Finally, it's disconcerting to see that this is a Larry Harmon production. True Laurel and Hardy fans, particularly the Sons of the Desert, know the story of Stan and Harmon. Hopefully, his association with their memories will end with this direct-to-video mistake.This film will prove benign to the memories of Stan and Ollie. Thankfully."
4,I enjoyed watching this movie.,I remember when this movie came out and my dad and i watched it together and we both enjoyed it.Their relatives not imatators and it is also a fun movie for kids to watch.
3,Respectable attempt to cover most of the major routines,"Hardy's performance was vastly superior to Laurel's. One of the major shortcomings was the failure to include a single walking through the door routine. A dissappointment was the rushed efforts to replicate true L&H timing genius in routines such as when Hardy becomes exasperated and says, ""never mind,"" after saying a few things in answer to Laurel's questions. The film reminded me of the post 1940's big productions that relied on other actors, sets, and better production values to prop up supplement the boys. Overall, this was a very valuable and rewarding movie and I did enjoy a lot of laughs. The only other L&H impersonation is an obscure movie by Bob Einstein (TV's Super Dave) named, ""Another Nice Mess"" from the mid 1970's, starring Rich Little as a blend of Nixon and Ollie."
3,A good bit never gets old,"Ollie and Stan still kill me. Whether it's the timeless originals, the delightful homage portrayed on Gilligan's Island with the Skipper and Gilligan, or this charming feature, the all ages slapstick humor never gets old. I would like to see more movies like this, just funny with no pretentions of grandeur."
1,Overpriced. Doesn't keep water warm.,"I use this product as a stylist. I give pedicures and this product is awful. The ""infrared heat"" is nothing more than a red light bulb that is only warm if you are about a centimeter away from it, but it is bright and is intrusive if you are trying to create a spa like experience. The replaceable foot pads come loose and float around. This doesn't keep water warm even if you start with very hot water, by the end of a pedicure service on a client the water is ice cold. It is not easy to store and doesn't hold very much water. Also the opening for the feet is strangely shaped and made it difficult when giving a pedicure and feet are moving in and out of the bath. I have given two pedicures with this product and will not give any more due to the low quality of this product, its embarrassing to use as a professional. Either spend more for a higher quality product, or find a similar product much* cheaper."
1,Not Impressed,I was not impressed with this hot spa. You could get the same treatment by soaking your feet in the bathtub. I would suggest spending a little more money to get a spa that has jets.
1,Another Looser,This product is awful. It was poorly packaged and shipped. It does not keep the water warm as advertised even if you start with very hot water. The attachments vibrate lose and float around in the bath. The only thing it does do is vibrate and make a lot of noise. Yet one more piece of kaka made in China. When will we get smart and go back to making our own consumables???
5,lots of fun,Really enjoy playing it. Fast paced is fun but it's nice to slow things down and do the puzzles. Glad I bought it.
4,Way to Addictive,"Even though all modes of the game can be completed in fairly short order, it is highly addictive nonetheless."
5,Fantastic Fun!,"This game is absolutely addictive! In fact, it is hard to put away! Once you get started, you want to see just how many levels you can conquer! So many levels can satisfy anyone who wants a lot of diversity in one game. If you like puzzles, you will love this!"
4,"Fast thinking, but don't look away from the screen!","This is a very fast game of flicking marbles everywhere, but don't let your eyes leave the screen or you are out of luck!!!You have to pay close attention to this one!! It is satisfying to win a quest. That is where all your marbles are gone from the spiral board. It is still a fun game to get."
5,Excellent and brief compendium of financial theory,"This book covers quite a few fields (axiomatic probability, stochastic processes, financial theory) to the extent that they relate to valuation of securities. Naturally, the scope of coverage in such a brief tome (< 300 p.) is limited. It is written clearly and with precision, with sufficient number of exercises provided at chapters' ends. I would say that it goes to greater depth than Neftci, and is far more rigorous than Wilmott. Incomparably easier to understand than Merton. The only shorcomings I can find are relative paucity of examples and inadequate Index."
5,"Hitachi 3""blade",I have recently received my hitachi blade and could not be happier. It arrived promptly here in Western Australia and at a price that was very reasonable. The product description was detailed and easy to understand. This was my first purchase from amazon and I will be making others.
2,I don't think these are real.,"The product I received did not seem like a real Monroe product. It had no markings whatsoever and was suspicious that it might be a refurb item. The product page makes no mention of whether the item is new or not. Part of the item had paint that easily rubbed off indicating that it was painted and an area that should not have seen paint. Also one of the end caps was fitted crooked. Finally, it did not fit my truck. I verified using the tool provided as well as going to Monroe website directly to make sure it fit my 1987 LandCruiser. I had to modify the shocks because the bolts inserts were too small. It made my truck bouncy on city streets, but seemed better off-road. After a couple of weeks I put my old oil shocks back on my trunk. I would have returned it, but I took these on my trip to Ethiopia so bringing them back is not worth the hassle and luggage weight."
5,Awesome Cookbook !,"I recently made a birthday party for my daughter who requested home made cupcakes. I looked through this book and found an adaptation for one of the recipes to accomodate cupcakes. They came out delicious; not too sweet, so once I put the frosting on them, they were just right. Thank you for selling such a great book. I purchased this book as gift for a friend who attended the birthday party as well, and they are very pleased."
4,Good English Lit.,"I enjoyed these short stories. I've read some of his other works, and I was not dissapointed. I'm sorry it took me so long to find him."
5,ExCeLlEnT,"Tom Is GREAT! Do I need to say Anything else?Anyways Tom is better than other musicians I have heard. Listen to ""Caminhos Cruzados"" when you are sad, ""Home Bass"" when you are happy, ""Two for T"" when you are bored, and by golly, who knows what else.Got to go, see you later.Nina K*****"
4,Parade of the Athletes,"It is very good, but only if you are absolutely sure you don't want any vocals"
3,EXPECTING MORE,"THIS ALBUM WAS HYPED UP IN THE REVIEWS. I LOVE TIESTO AND CAN ENJOY ANYTHING HE PUTS OUT, BUT I WAS HOPING TO GET DOWN WITH SOME HARDCORE TRANCE TRACKS, BUT I ENDED UP FEELING LIKE THE SONGS ALL SOUNDED THE SAME AND NONE REALLY CARRIED A DISTINCT RHYTHM...SOMEWHAT ERRATIC IN NATURE. I HOPE THAT LISTENING TO IT MORE WILL HELP CHANGE MY MIND, AND IF IT DOES, I WILL ERASE THIS REVIEW AND LEAVE A BETTER ONE."
3,It has some good stuff..,"There are a couple of songs that I liked on this album, notably the 2nd track, but for the most part the rest of the album didn't really catch my fancy whatsoever. It has a few intriguing moments, but it's really quite bland. Not bad, but not great."
4,Olympic Gold,"This is an album you wanna get wheather you're new to the whole trance scene or been in it long time. It's real Tiesto Gold with all tracks written and produced specially for the olympics by the master himself. If only the first track was something else, there would be five stars on the top. You just can't top playing under the Olympic flame for people from all around the world."
4,Really good!,This one is great driving and working out music. It evoked an emotional response with clever use of melody. The other tracks from Just Be fit in well and it didn't bother me that they were included. This is a milestone work for the Tiesto's career and gerne. Some of it had me probing the inner recesses of my mind. Very visual music. I must pick up more by Tiesto.
3,"Good, but not that good","I bought this album purely due to its HUGE importance that it has now played in the history of electronic music being that it is from the night Tiesto DJed the opening ceremony of the 2004 Olympics. It was such an incredible night to watch and hear one of the best DJs spin the ceremony. But this album is poorly put together and the mixing between the tracks is poorly done in many instances. The DJing isnt much better than what I do (not saying much) and it has a really choppy feel throughout the entire album. While the tracks are good, and the new unrealeased tracks on here are really cool, they are typical ""Tiesto tracks"" and if youve heard one youve heard them all...hyped up beats on linear progression with a climax melody that anooys you after about 10 seconds. Eventhough I didnt enjoy the album much, it is still a must due to its history and importance it now holds. Plus, the insert has some awesome pictures..."
2,An unoriginal episode for Tiesto,what we have here is repackaged old tracks and rip offs of other peoples tracks.the mixing is poor.track 6 was done better b4. look for Rollerball 'albinoni'on anjunabeats.track 7 is a shameful rip off of Rah 'Pole Position' (platipus euro records)im a big tiesto fan and this was a real let down with regard to the mixing and the new music.Any REAL trance fan can see through this for what it is.A cash in for the american market.
1,Eh,I gave up on Tiesto a long time ago. He has got to be one of the most over rated DJ's of our time. The only people that like this guy are kids that have no experience with House Music. Check out my other reviews for some good recommendations.
4,Lots of Fun!,"Even as an adult, I saw this book and had to play with it. It is made of very thick, sturdy, laminated, cardboard and has only six pages. The book asks you to sing and record various parts of ""Old MacDonalds Farm"" while you are visited by a chicken, pig and bear. John Lund mixes photographs of what seems to be stuffed animals with his own illustrations. I thought the illustrations were very busy, but probably gives the child plenty of visual material, considering the short length of the book.The interesting part of this book was the small digital recorder. The recorder was extremely easy to use--you hold down one button to record and one button to play, and the recording and playback quality was good for such a small size. This book could certainly lead to many hours of entertainment."
5,"beautiful watch, reasonably priced!","I really like this watch! It is very pretty, and comfortable to wear. This is the second time I have purchased this watch. (I wish I could purchase a new watchband for this watch, since the first watch itself is still in good working order!)The watch is pretty enough to use as a dress watch, but is reasonably priced, so I use it as my ""go to work"" watch."
5,OMG TAMOGOTCHIS ARE THE BEST!,"Tamagotchi's are amazing! I simply adore them. I had this Tamogotchi ; same style, but I lost it while I was hiking in a forest. I am looking for another one, but everywhere I look they are sold out! They are very popular and I think they always will be. Version 3 is the latest version they have, and I think it's pretty cool. It has loads of games, and a lot of delicious food your Tamagotchi can eat. The thing I really enjoy is when you can buy a ticket from the store. I bought one for my Tamagotchi, and it went to Chile! My Tamogotchi, Alana, brought back maracas. Okay I really recommend this toy to anyone that are ages 9 and ^!Thank YOU for your time and politenessSINCERLY,Mishal, Age 10 turning eleven in AUGUST!"
4,The Best,This kind of tamagotchi rules! it's for boys and girls which also rules! everything about it rules! if u do not think so plz tell me
3,"Super cute but NOT rugged, only lasted 7 months.","I used these mostly for cleaning out the chicken coop and for really rainy days. They always made me smile and drew lots of complements. They got me through 7 months sporadic use until tonight when the rubber seperated at the toes. They were very grippy, I slipped frequently on smooth surfaces.I'm considering upgrading to the Chooka boot from western Chief."
3,Cute and Functional,"If you love anything ladybug, these are a must have! They are very cute and are great to wear in the rain or stomping around in a muddy yard. The only problem is the size. Depending on the cut of the shoe, I wear either an 8 or 8-1/2. These boots don't come in half sizes, and all the reviews I read recommended to go down a size instead of up. I went with an 8. They're okay (without socks), but I wish I had a little more wiggle room for my toes. I think a size 9 would have been way too big, although I'd probably be able to slip them on without using the handles. It doesn't matter! If you don't want to ruin your shoes in the rain or mud and you want to have some fun, buy these! or any of the other Western Chief boots!"
2,Cute But Cracked!,"I got these boots a year ago...super comfortable and cute, but by Fall both cracked! Very dissapointed for the money! I really would like another pair, but I can't justify the money when they're probably just going to do it again!"
2,Breakdown,"Within the first couple of months, the materials started to separate on the heal of the left boot. Now that they are about 7 months old, they are all but shot. They have been used for simple chores and only once made it to the wash rack before they started leaking. While they garnered a great amount of amusement, they are not comfortable for the flat-footed individual and the shape does not allow for insole inserts. Cute but not very functional."
4,ladybug boots,"These boots make rainy days fun again! While these boots are easy to slip on and off, they aren't as rugged as I would like. The back seam ripped on my first pair of boots while I was working on the farm. Luckily Amazon replaced them for me and I will wear them more gently this time. Whenever my friends see me in my ladybug boots, they are pea green with envy! Too bad Western Chief doesn't make ladybug raincoats and umbrellas in adult sizes."
2,Cracked in 5 days!,"I bought these for my daughter for her birthday 5 days ago, they were $45 and she just called to tell me they cracked already! They are very cute but NOT durable!"
5,Farming in Style!,"I purchased this boot mainly because of the low cut.They are put on with the greatest of ease. I use them in the garden andin the barn.They are so light weight that I had forgotten I still had them on when I went into town.Everyone thought they were so cute!Cute and functional, that's what I like!"
2,"Oh just SOUNDS, no words...","This soundtrack compilation is NOT the opening theme songs that have vocals, these are simply the musical themes.Great price if all you want is the music. If you are looking for the actual songs from the movies, you do NOT want this CD."
3,Not what I thought it was,"I bought this product thinking and believing it was vocals of the James Bond themes. Instead, it was instrumentals and while they are nice, they are not themes that are tremendously well done."
1,Beware of the Midis!,"A very low-quality collection of James Bond themes. The fact is that there was no ""United Studio Orchestra,"" as claimed on the cover, just some dude with a bunch of midis and a cheap sound card. Even by 2003 standards (when this cd was produced) the audio quality of these pieces were really bad."
5,"The Knights Templar ""hidden"" adgenda revealed.","Author, Bill Mann leads his readers through an intricate maze of seemingly unrelated events and clues to uncover a possible correlation between the Knights Templar and their activites in the New World, before Columbus.This book should be on every Templar scholar's bookshelf."
1,A mish-mash of information,This is just a lot of speculation thrown together with no real conclusion. Many of references are incorrect or modified to try to fit them into the ideas of the author. I would not recommend this book.
1,Nonsense,"Although Mr. Mann has provided raw research material which keeps you from having to seek out some facts on your own, once he begins his ""thoughts"" or draws conclusions you can tune out. This is the worst kind of forced fit fact conglomerating I have seen in this subject area. Many of his insights border on free associations with little to no foundation. Futher, check many of his references and it becomes obvious that from citation to recitation Mr. Mann has colored the data to fit his pre-(ill)conceived notions regarding Nova Scotia and Oak Island as the Elysian Fields of all understanding and explanation for Templar related mysteries. Not worth the effort unless you wish to compare this to actual worthwhile books on the subject by other authors. Then again, maybe it's just more purposeful disinformation :-)"
4,Nice boot in the cold and dry,This is a warm and comfy boot. I don't wear them around the house much as they are really meant to be worn outside on those cold and clear days. Here in the Pacific Northwest many days are chilly and wet. A walk out across the wet lawn can soak the tops of the boots and seep into my stocking feet. I can't stand cold wet socks and I'm sure the sheep don't like it either. I have given the boot a 4 star rating as I do love them on the right occasion.
4,Not bad but could be better,"i enjoyed this cd and the production was good, spin the bottle is pure genius i laugh everytime i hear it, but they cant rap as good as 2pac as one person said in their review, not as good as eminem either, so i reccomend you pick this cd up, along with the slim shady lp or the marshall mathers lp...peace"
1,What is this?,"seriously, to even compare them to icp is an insult! people said that if you like icp youll like twiztid. i love icp and i hate this cd! the people who think twiztid is better than icp are insane! there are only three songs worth listening to 3,4, and 7! save your money and buy anothter icp cd! there rapping is horrible , even adding icp to the cd couldnt save this cd! i listened to it for less than a week! its rancid!"
4,ICP and then some,"ICPish with a little more depth and ""rock"". ICP jumps in with some of these songs and just eliminate any suckness from this album. I like ICP, and since I've found Twizted, I like them, too. Amazon was the only place I could fine the Twizted CD, though. They've also got the best price."
4,Good Stuff,I find this to be the best Twiztid album availiable. With the exception of about 2 songs you can listen to this CD from beginning to end without the inconvenience of having to change the track seeking something more aurally pleasing.
4,Impressive CD,"Twiztid Truely shows who they are and what they can bring to the table.Showing they have tons of amount of talent more than ICP,even though being on the same label.Songs like ""Diemothaf****kadie"",""2nd hand smoke"",""Renditions of reality"" and ""How does it feel?"" show how much your ears can get drawn into the music.If it wasn't for ICP being on this record(my personal opinion) this would be a perfect CD.So if you can handle skipping a few tracks,you'll love this CD"
5,One of Twiztid's BEST,This is an early album for Twiztid! This goes to show they rocked even at the start. The great lyrics accociated with the Voices of Jamie Madrox and Monoxide child are the absolute best. The best song would have to be DIE MOTHERF*****DIE! This is one of the best albums if you dont have it get it cause it rocks!!
3,Geometry: A Self-Teaching Guide,"This review is based on the first chapter.The authors/editors did a poor job reviewing this book for errors. I checked the publisher's website and they do not provide online corrections. Being a self-teaching guide it contains self-tests, but when the answers are wrong it is very confusing to the learner.The discussion on trapezoids is confusing because they only illustrate isosceles trapezoids (but just call them ""trapezoids"" ) this gives the impression at all trapezoids are isoceles with base angles of equal value."
1,The ending is an insult to humanity and good taste. FOR SHAME!!!!!!!,Music is great-my favourite modern cycle. Now what in gods name does the end mean. And more than that-it distracts from one of the most glorious musical segments in history with an absurd and meaningless concept that really has no bearing on the rest of the opera(s). It really breaks all rules of good taste and shamefully disctracts the listener and viewer from what they should be feeling as Wagner concludes this epic. I am flabbergasted and appalled that such a crock of sh****T was allowed to ruin this otherwise wonderful production. I recommend the Die Walkure as the best part of this set.The End--a group of people wheel out televisions and sip martinis while a blond boy and girl decide to hold hands.(In this ring--all walsungs have red hair so dont go there) It is even worse than what I have described because I am too upset to go on. FOR SHAME!!!!!!
5,"Any ""You Don't Know Jack"" PC Game","If you never heard of or never played YDKJ (any of the games) your life is incomplete! Although dated, they are still extremely fun to play!"
4,MINTS!!!,"Tasty, WAY cheaper than store bought. Can't go wrong if you munch lotsa mints. Probably a 100 year storage life...not a problem."
5,Amazing Piece of Work,"Honestly, I believe that Shane Alan has shared with us an amazing peice of work in his music. To me his music is a replica to new inspiration in life. The instrumental music really speaks out for itself. Eyes of Innocence is my favorite CD in this world today. I listen to it every day, in my house, car, office, name it all. I am an advocate for selling his CD's worldwide. Shane's music is very soothing to the ears, it has the ability to comfort and ehance your spiritual mood. All the songs in this CD are highly rated by me, especially the last song GRACE. If you like piano, instrumental, jazz like music then Shane is the person to listen too."
2,Not Worth the Money,"I was very dissapointed by this product for two reasons. 1) It is a bit flimsy. I was trying to make brownies the other night and I had to put A LOT of effort into mixing the batter something I have never had to do. I ended up switching to my bamboo spoon made by Pampered Chef after a few minutes which worked great. 2) I do not think the wooden handle is very good quality. It feels as though it will crack at any moment. I have only washed it by hand so that should not be the case. Bottom line, there are better spatulas out there. I suggest you find a different one. I like Pampered Chef and Williams Sonnoma."
2,"Update - Okay, finally can get the handle out!","This tool works well, but one must remove the handle before putting it in the dishwasher. When first obtained, could not get the wooden handle out of the spoon. Now that I have had it a while, it can be removed, but it still troubles me that the handle, which does get exposed to food when using, can't be sanitized in the dishwasher. There are other silicone spatula/spoons that have dishwasher-safe handles and I'd recommend those instead."
5,Heat resistant spatula,These are great! Use them for regular use as well as on very hot liquids. Withstands heat wonderfully! Will purchase more.
1,Misrepresented,"I ordered this spatula in another color, (Carribean), and the description, like all the other colors stated that it was heatproof to 800 degrees F.However when I received it, the sticker on the handle stated that it was only heat resistant to 482 degrees F.This description is a misrepresentation... I saw that all the colors state an 800 degree heat tolerance, however, if you look at the sticker on the handle when you receive it, you will notice it says 482F/250C. I'm really disappointed as I need one heatproof beyond 500 degrees.As I stated in a review on the color I purchased, this description needs to be corrected. Don't be surprised if your spatula melts."
3,Order not correct,This is a great product - what is pictured anyway. I received a mislabeled spatula - paid for the large spoon but rec'd the small spatula. :-(Had to return.
3,large spatula spoon disappointing,"I love Le Creuset - particularly the cast iron - and have many of their products, but I found the large spatula spoon to be a disappointment. It's fine for scooping whipped cream or beaten egg whites out of a bowl, but for any sort of scraping or turning application, or scooping of a dense material such as a cookie dough, I find it's really too soft to perform well. The other spatulas are better, although marginally so. I think the ones in the grocery for $1.99 are still our best bet."
3,Disappointing!,"I had an older Le Creuset spatula spoon that I absolutely loved and used for cooking every day. After 8 years, it finally got a crack/tear and needed to be replaced. I ordered this and was so disappointed when it arrived! Much less of a spoon and much more of a regular spatula than the older version. Will be keeping it because I don't want to pay for the return shipping but would not order it again and if I had seen it in a store, would not have purchased it."
3,XML from A to Z,"As with all of Heather Williamson's books, this was easy to reference and very helpful."
2,POOR EXCUSE FOR SOME GOOD THEATER MUSIC,"The best of Broadway? Sure, if you consider the best of Broadway only those songs taken only from RCA Victor cast recordings. Expect the expected: Tracks from ""Ragtime,"" ""Chicago,"" ""42nd Street"" and ""Man of La Mancha,"" sung by the likes of AudraMcDonald, Bebe Neuwirth, Jerry Orbach and Brian Stokes Mitchell. Including a live recording of Barbara Cook warbling ""Losing My Mind"" from her ""Mostly Sondheim"" CD isn't exactly kosher. But then again, neither is this gimmick-riddled release. Curtain up?Half-way, maybe. Light the lights? Dim them, please."
5,Great documentary,"If you're a fan of Bill Withers' uplifting music, you'll love this documentary. It was a very inspirational and moving experience."
5,Loved it,I watched this movie in a college class. I loved it so much I had to purchase it for myself. Wonderful story line. Bill is a fabulous man with a beautiful voice.
2,Poorly Paced and Edited,"Having attended the tribute concert that was barelly mentioned in this film, I was so excited to finally see Still Bill. I'm sorry to say, though I am a fan of Withers and was completely knocked out by the tremendous concert, I feel very let down by this film. I thought it was poorly paced and edited. Though we see Withers in past clips and present events like his high school reunion, a reunion with the guys he served with in the Navy and the concert I mentioned, none of these events last more than a minute, all are cut away from awkwardly and fail to inform us about the man. The musicians who performed at the tribute briefly appear making some comment on his work, but it is so random and unclear, it has little effect. A visit to his home town and other later events, which I will let the viewer see, do begin to reveal Withers, but not enough for me. I was disappointed."
1,"No market research is worth $3,500.00",I have found cheaper market research on POS. This item is extremely overpriced! There are several academic and peer-reviewed papers available on the free web for no charge.
3,Paybacks always a BITCH,I enjoyed the book and look forward to the sequel.I found myselfscimming over some of the dialog from Ma because it tended to go on and on but all in all the book was a good read and I look forward to finding out what payback Mende will get.
3,Ok Read,"I read this book in one night, but only to get to the second book to see if it was any better. Instead of 3 stars, I give it 2 1/2."
1,POOR PERFORMANCE HIGH PRICE,I ORDERED THIS PART NUMBER AND THE ITEM I RECIEVED DOESNT RESEMBLE THE BLADE SHOWN HERE. ITEM I RECIEVED HAS THE STAR CENTER HOLE..BELL SHAPE AND THE DIAMOND BAND IS THINNER AND DOES NOT WRAP AROUND THE FLATTENED SIDES..SAME PRICE. INTENDED USE WAS TO REMOVE SANDED GROUT AROUND A KITCHEN SINK. BLADE STOPPED CUTTING AFTER ABOUT SIX INCHES. REPOSITIONING THE BLADE SEVRAL TIMES LET ME FINISH ABOUT A FIFTH OF THE SINK (4/20 SIX INCH TILES) BEFORE THE BLADE WAS TOTALLY USELESS.
2,Unfortunately Poor Sound Quality,"While I love Sarah McLachlan's voice, the sound quality of these CDs is abysmal, making it difficult to enjoy. The spoken words in between various songs are so quiet that it's impossible to hear what she's saying without turning up the volume.The audience screaming and applauding come through quite well, unfortunately.I was so disappointed with this CD. The songs are great, but they're also very soft in the recordings and I need to boost the volume (again) when playing them in a mix with other recordings.If you want a collection of her CDs, skip this one and stick with the studio recordings."
1,Mirrorball: Why bother?,"Sarah McLachlan has a hauntingly beautiful voice. It is a shame that most of her music sounds and feels just like most of the rest of her music. There is little variance in the rhythym, harmony or subject matter. I purchase the CD for the rendition of ""Will You Remember Me?"" I was not disappointed. It is one of the few tracks that has a unique and piercing quality. But for the rest, I have never pushed ""skip"" so many times! And what's with the language? When did that become necessary? It just feels cheap."
2,Band with potential - Potentially bad album,"After hearing such great things about this band from fellow Dave Matthews Band fans, I decided to give Revel a shot. I don't like it. I was expecting (from comparisons) to hear a combination of DMB and ekoostik hookah. They ended being a terribly cheesy pop band. The highlights, musically, come from members who are not even in the band (saxophones). PMB's lyrics have absolutely no depth. It seems like they are trying to say something, but don't have an elegant way of putting it. This band however seems to have great musicianship, nothing special individually though. Too bad - I really wanted to like this band."
4,Incredible,"So I heard PMB for the first time three years ago at Christmas time...I've been looking for the CD ever since - and I finally bought Revel - just as great as the first time, if not better. I fell in love with the music the first time, and it gets to me every time. I liked Dave Matthews when he was a local band - Pat McGee band, although they deserve their fame, is one of the best kept secrets! Pick it up, and youll know what I mean! ENJOY!"
5,"Great, relaxing, unpretentious music","This guy knows what he does well, and that's what he does. It's good, catchy music with great acoustic guitar playing. Perfect relaxing music.It's really just white preppy college music, but it's done very well. Pat doesn't try to be something he isn't.Rebecca, Passion and All Around Us are real winners."
1,Badly disappointed,"I own HCS '04 and I thought (and still think) it's on OK program with some performace issues. Now, we bought this at our local software store because it promised to be much better and faster than the '04 version. Me and my wife found both claims to be somewhat exaggerated. The difference between the '04 version and this '06 version is marginal and negligible at best. The problem of this application being a resource hog still there (taking more than 100Mb physical RAM and north of 20% CPU at times). Definitely not a good buy. Please ignore the 5-star rating given to this product--there is no way on earth to give this poorly engineered piece of software 5-stars."
1,Too bad a rating of negative star isn't available,"If all you want to do is reporduce Hallmark cards as they are presented by the program, then this is for you. If you have used Printshop or Greeting Card Factory or any other card software, you will be disappointed by the limited flexibilty of this software. As far as extra clip art there isn't much. This is a rip off by Hallmark!"
1,One-Star?,"This Hallmark Card Studio 2006 Deluxe I bought might not even deserve one star. I've loaded many programs, but couldn't make this one load, even after letting it load all night. I emailed tech support, and the response was to clean the discs. I did, but that didn't help. Of four discs, my loading always hung up on disc two. In the past,I easily loaded my HCS 2004 and 2005, but this Creative Home software makes me wonder how and why in the world Hallmark Licensing, usually representing quality, I think, let themselves be represented by this product."
5,* * * * * (5 STAR),I have had great success creating cards with the 2006 version of Card Studio. I love that this software makes creating personalized greeting cards so fun and easy to make. My grand kids love receiving cards with there name printed on them.The only issue I had was during the downloading. I received an error that prevented me from putting it on my computer. I called Tech support immediately. It turns out I did not have the latest Windows installer (I found out that I have never updated my computer...ever). After updating my Windows XP it loaded just fine and I have been printing cards ever since.
2,Extremely Disappointed,When printing cards it leaves a large border around front of card graphics. The cards do not print anything like they are shown on box display with front of card display taking up the whole card. When I contacted tech support I was advised that in order to correct this problem my printer must have a borderless printing option. My printer does not & I have been using another major greeting card software for about a year and half and never had this problem with that program. There is nothing on the outside of box under the system requirements that states this.On the outside of the box it says you can return for refund if not satified within 30 days and that the details are in the box. There are not any details in the box and when I contacted the company I got run around in circles stating there were two companies involved with the software and was never given information on how it could be returned. I am stuck with it.
2,Product Change in this version,"This was my fourth product of Hallmark software, but it will be my last. I came very close to returning it as per the 30 day option. In all the previous versions I could copy the clip art to use in other applications. This was one of main reasons for my purchasing a Hallmark product. I love their art---nothing compares to it. The change with this version does not allow you to copy the clip art directly into any other product than a Hallmark product. I now have to open my old version as well as the new version, copy from the new version into the old version and then I can copy the clip art and paste it into other programs I use (specifically Publisher and Photo Draw)."
4,The Celicates - Suicide Boogie (1998),"Nice debut album of this band from Paris, France. Originally released in 1998.The band got it's own style though they run under Neo-Rockabilly. The band does not exist any more but the head of the band has formed a new band by the name of SWINDLE in 2002. He's also played with the FRANTIC FLINTSTONES and various other bands of that music style. He's a long time guitar player and played hundreds of concerts all around Europe. The CELICATES also feature on various compilations like ROCKING WITH THE FROGGS (1997), COSMIC TRIP (1997) and others......"
4,A great album lyrically and musically,"The first full length by weaklazyliar is a doozy. Maintaining a folk/pop/rock sensibility throughout, this disc goes from slow and beautiful acoustic ballads like the haunting ""Snow"" to full on rockers like ""Forgive"". The real highlight is the excellent lyrical quality. Lyricist Gerlinda Grimes really opens up in expressing emotion and telling stories. Listen carefully to the sympathy that her words and voice convey for a teenage outcast in ""Bright Yellow Bucket"". In addition to the strength of the original material is an excellent unlisted cover of The Pixies' ""Levitate Me"". Definitely worth the price of a disc."
4,Excellent,"With driving lyrics and intense backbone, this album is the best to date for WWL! Do not miss this album!"
5,better than FLAPS assemblies,"These blade insert replacements easily replace the OEM piece on our VW Golf, preserving the manufacturer's design and avoiding getting locked in to a third-party replacement for the future. 5 minutes per blade, using a pair of pliers."
1,Crappy strap - don't buy!,"Within 1 day of using this strap, the outside layer started coming off, to reveal a cheap, cardboard-like material underneath.I am extremely unhappy about this strap.It is totally worn out with just 1 day of use."
3,travel book laced with his sense of failure and despair,"This makes for some pretty dreary reading. Over 30 years ago, Naipal headed for his old home with a sense of foreboding and depression. These are interesting for what they tell of the emotional sources of his novels, in particular Mr. Biswas, so are worth a read by his most devoted fans, of which I am one. But looking at this as a reading experience, I must say that it is not as good as many of his other books. Indeed, I sometimes felt he was straining to add drama, rather than what I expect as the treasure of interesting and unusual observations that I am accustomed to finding in his books. It is, as always, beautifully written and vivid.Recommended with these caveats in mind."
3,Just the Facts Please,The first 14 pages were facts about alternatives to nursing homes. It was dry compared to ELDER RAGE. Information was somewhat useful.
3,"Funny clock, just a bit noisy","My ex-coworker have one in her office. After I saw it, I got to have my own. This clock is funny. It is a bit noisy. From the picture displayed, I thought I was getting two clocks. The picture is a bit misleading, but I should have read it more carefully. Overall, it's still a nice funny clock. It was shipped to me in perfect condition and is creating lot of laughs in the office."
3,Fun!,I hung this in my bathroom so I could read it in the mirror. It would be better if the numbers were backwards.
4,great attraction,"this was a great buy at the price. now whenever we have new company over, this clock always creates something to talk about. then it becomes a guessing game as to who can really tell the time without looking at a regular clock."
3,What's so special about a backwards clock??,"My brother got this for his 11th birthday, but after like 3 hours it stopped running. It turned out that these things easily suck up the battery on the first 3 hours or so but then it works well. 2 years later and he's donated it because a) he is tired of it b) he can't find a place to put it and c) it goes too slow anyway. The only good thing about it is that it looks great and is at a fairly low price. I don't know if this is how all backwards clocks work or if we just got a defective one. But anyway, aside from its good looks and low price, what IS so special about a backwards clock?!"
1,DID NOT WORK,"I put two batteries in and it kept time well enough for about a half hour. Then it proceded to stop, and would not start ever again."
1,Cheaply Made,"While fun and cheap, this clock was not worth any money. I had it up for less than a month before it stopped working."
1,DON'T BUY!,"I just opened to load battery and the face is all scratched. I didn't expect quality, but this is either a returned item or just terribly handled during manufacturing. I'm so disappointed as this was to be a fun little gifty and now it is too late to get a replacement from a different seller. GRRRR. Avoid this product as not worth it, regardless of the price."
1,Backward clock,"Not impressed. I saw the write up but didn't really pay attention to it and didn't expect it to be like this...For the younger set, I'm sure they get a kick out of it, but I'm old and I find it weird."
5,This book is the helpful you csn get,"If you are thinking of getting a divorce, you NEED to read thisbook first!!! I never could have done it without it. I savedthousands of dollars and my sanity! Read it!"
1,Poor packing,"Cute makeup, not the color I ordered, and broken when I got it. Compact was broken as well as the makeup."
3,not bad depending on what you're doing,Not bad for what $65 can get you. For me it was a little weak because it only has 12.5 ft. lb. of torque. Not enough. If it was my choice I'd return it and get a IR 105D2 which costs $79.99 but has 25ft. lb. of torque.
1,Tiny bits and pieces may be hazardous.,"I was definitely sceptical to give these to my small dogs for fear of them choking even a large dog would probably swallow whole with out a care in the world. But a good portion of the bag are pieces less than and 1"" so in my opinion a choking hazard."
1,Very disappointed,I am a huge fan of Peter Gabriel. I consider him to be truly gifted. But this is one of the worst CDs I have ever purchased.
2,doesnt properly work,"my 2 and 5 years olds do like this toy and to carry it around but other than that , the one piece fell off so it doesn't hold the disks and the voice activated commands never worked"
4,Ordinary people in extraordinary situations,"Carmen and Wayne Colson are unwilling witnesses to the collision of killers Richie Nix and Blackbird. Partly to avoid retribution and partly to avoid being caught, Nix and Blackbird decide that the world needs two witnesses fewer.Leonard is excellent at taking ordinary people like the Colsons and turning them into heros. The detailing of the characters is up to his usual standard, and the book kept me reading eagerly until it was over."
2,Disappointing First Foray into Elmore Leonard,"I don't usually put books down, but this book by Elmore Leonard just didn't do it for me. I checked this out from the library because I have been hearing about Leonard's craft for some time. I don't know if it is the genre or what, but this book never gripped me. It was written well enough, but I had no connection with the characters and no real desire to spend time learning more about them. They seemed flat. I wanted to like this book. Maybe someday I'll give Leonard another try, but for now, I am going to turn to other things."
2,Not very exciting,When I bought this book I was under the impression it was going to be action packed. It was slow and boring to read. I contemplated stop reading this halfway through but pushed on waiting for a good ending that never came. Don't waste your money.
4,"""KILLSHOT"" INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT FOR LEONARD","""KILLSHOT"" FROM ELMORE LEONARD, EXAMINES A SLIGHTLY NEW SIDE OF THE MASTER OF MYSTERY. THE MAIN CHARACTERS WHICH WE ARE SUPPOSED TO SYMPATHIZE WITH HAVE LITERALLY NO CRIMINAL BACKROUND. AND INSTEAD OF THE SUNNY BEACHES OF THE MIAMI'S AND SOUTH BEACH'S OF FLORIDA, WE ARE IN A LITTLE WOODSIE TOWN. THIS NEW STYLE OF LEONARD'S IS AMAZINGLY NICE. GREAT BUT NOT HIS BEST."
5,The BEST Cat and Mouse Story I've Ever Listened To....,"When a couple unwittingly witnesses a crime, their lives get turned upside down. A hitman that was seen by the wife is now out to ""tie up"" loose ends and they must defend themselves. Ryder Strong, the narrator, with his low and menacing voice really brings the characters, especially Arman the hitman, to life. He keeps the listener in suspense, hungry for the next part of the plot to unfold."
2,Where's the Fire? Where's the Point?,"Disappointing effort by Oliver Nelson and Jimmy Smith to make this music come out fresh in a jazz environment. When Jimmy isn't playing and it's just the big band, the bow to the Prokofiev score is perfunctory and uninspired. With Jimmy, things get better, but too often he lapses into his standard riffs and signature hold-the-high-note gee-wizardry. It's Jimmy in his ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff"" mode, minus anything new to say.It's a tough business, turning the classics into pop or jazz. A few years back Carlos Santana did a cool thing with an unpromising theme from the Brahms Third Symphony. Who knows when it will work? For it surely will, here and there. But it didn't on this Jimmy Smith outing. And at under 33 minutes of music, do you really want to pop for it?"
5,~~A Genuinely Lovely Study~~,"This truly is a novel written with patience and love - with a fascinating peek into obscure moments in the evolution of ancient theatre and philosophy! The protagonist, Nikeratos, is a tragic actor. Through him, we see momentous events of ancient history evolve. The characters are drawn in such a way that makes them timelessly endearing - the language is subtly poetic and conjures images of the age. After reading this novel, I made it my quest to read more on the subject matter - including Plutarch's LIVES and the writings of Plato. Mary Renault's studies of Alexander the Great are equally fascinating. Yet I must say that her ""Mask of Apollo"" sits quite sturdily, albeit inconspicuously, among my all-time favorite books!"
2,the Mask of Apollo,"After reading _The King Must Die_ and loving it, I picked up _The Mask of Apollo_, hoping for the same - I just couldn't get it to it. I found the plot too slow, and the characters unlovable. I would rather have read a non-fiction history of the time; this book just couldn't keep my interest, though I am interested in the history of the period. I haven't given up on Mary Renault - I plan to read _The Fire From Heaven_ soon."
2,Boring with little character description,"This book I would only recommend to a Greek Historian. I had to read the Mask of Apollo for school and if I read more then 10 pages at a time I was doing good. Niko just sort of walks around the whole time and doesn't do much. Only at the very end does the book get a little bit intersting. The author also doesn't give very good character depth so you just get a feeling of ""BLAH"" from this book."
1,Mask of Apollo only good for the interested in greek history,i thought the mask of apollo was a dull book that was hard to follow i was to read this book for a school project and although i am able to follow most books i found this one most strenous to read. I am not at all interested in greek history and was amazed at all the talk of homosexual affiars. I would not recommend this book for any child under the age of 18 who has no interest in histroy. i would recomend this book to children with devoted interest to history and who are good at reading comprehension and to adults who are interested in greek history.
1,Tiny,"I was kind of disappointed with this because it's really small. I don't think my toes are fatter than anyone else's but this ring cannot fit even near the base of my toe. I have to put it on the smallest part and even then the adjustable part doesn't come close enough to be secure. I can't even get it past the nail on my pinky finger. I have a feeling it will either break or im going to lose it. It also disappointing because I was looking for something that would be secure and sturdy. It looked in the picture like it would be something that would meet my needs. In reality, it's really just a sliver of silver that's tiny. It did, however, arrive pretty quickly."
4,Super Informative,"I found this book to be quite informative. It essentially covers the trials and tribulations of 6 `super' chefs in the pursuit of their eatery empires. Like you and me they have their share of personal challenges and I thought this book covered it quite well. Definitely worth a read, might just give you insight on some things you need to be aware off while building your restaurant empire."
2,Bland,"This is a 2 disc set where one of them is double-sided.I might need to watch this set again but on my first view, I was not impressed at all. Granted, the video quality (not remastered) and acting is what it was for the time these were made, but IMO the only movie of note in bland-bland set is the ""Shaolin Drunk Monk"" starring Gordon Liu.Fans of the older kung-fu fighting films will recognize many of the faces on all these films... There is a good amount of fighting on all these films, just not that great. Honestly, I would skip this set and get Shaolin vs Ninja(Heros of the East), Fist of Legend, Fearles, Ip Man, and all the Bruce Lee and Gordon Liu movies.I certainly do NOT give this a Highly Recommended rating...but it was a nice try..."
2,Let down by the writer,Sarah is let down by here writer here. Even she can't carry off some of his more banal trash. Watching the interviews in the specials I wanted to shake him out of his smugness. Riding on the coat tails of a potential comedy star his banalities drag down her performance especially in the third series. Skip this set and check her out on Larry Sanders show where she shines under the light of competent writers.
5,I love it!!,I love Sarah Silverman and this was a gift to me from my hubby while I am deployed. It is awesome
5,love her!,The whole series in one package it's great! If you are a fan you won't be disappointed and great price too.
5,Outstanding,"If you like to laugh and enjoy humor that pushes the acceptable social boundaries this is for you.IF you're not comfortable with racial, ethnic, political, abortion, and social economic jokes you should probably shy away."
2,Subject to severe paper jams,The 3500/3700 family has a good overall design using a vertical cartridge arrangement instead of the older rotating cartridge unit of the older 4500 family. THis should be a good printer like the excellent 4600 but unlike the 4600 the registration system in this machine is made of thin plastic parts and is subject to difficult to resolve paper jams. I advise you to spend a little more and get 4 times the printer with the HP4600. Its a little noisy but runs on and on. ITs the most reliable color laser ever built by man. Avoid this particular model at all cost.
5,simply beautiful,"if you're a fan of Lifeforms or FSOL in general this is a must have. remixes of the title track from the album of the same name, paths 1-7. the thing thats most exciting about these remixes are the additional vocals from singer Elizabeth Fraser, her gorgeous voice meshes perfectly with the earthen vibes present in the music. Future Sound of London out did themselves with the Lifeforms and these remixes are the compliment to the album, if you have a brain in your head you'll scoop this up. PEACE"
3,Well worn paths,"Little more than a puny supplemental to the seminal album with the same name, there are at least a few mixes here to justify a few light strolls down lesser-known paths."
1,An utter disappointment,"I was fully disappointed with this CD. I was ready to return it within not even one listening. I skimmed the tracks, and not one decent piece of music on the whole CD. Too bad my record place closed before I could return it. It has now become an expensive coaster for beer."
4,Fine Performance,"This is a very unique movie. In 1963 when it was released it went against many of the strict Hollywood conventions of the time. Specifically this film falls in the revisionist western genre with the anti-hero lead roll. Paul Newman is Hud. He is mean, sarcastic, disrespectful, and a drunk. He has no friends, he dispises his father, his nephew annoys him, and he basically tries to rape the woman he likes. Hud really has no redeaming qualities and Newman makes sure of it. The story takes us to rural Texas where Hud is a hand on his father's cattle ranch. In the next few days a series of events will occur that will change the lives of everyone in the movie. This is a well made film with great performances from everyone in the cast. It is definatly worth watching particullarly for people who like character driven movies."
5,best of paul newman talents,"The whole cast was terrific except Brandon De Wilde.He was too stiff,non-emotional,even Larry McMurtry said he was not ""real""as a horseman,did not have the Texas touch.All the rest were first class,tops!!!Small changes to the book but they ""worked"".Wonderfully rendered.A classic.A piece of small town life that is gone.The emergence of the cowboy in texas to the oilman,from the old west to the astrodome.Newman & Neal lit lust fires.Hot stuff for it's time.Wonderful story."
5,Possibly Paul Newman's greatest performance.,"In this smalltown drama, Hud (Paul Newman) seems very independent. He drinks, womanizes and drives fast. While this intrigues Hud's nephew, it disapoints his father. In reality Hud craves attention. When he begins actively seeking this attention, he drives away everyone close to him.This is quite possibly Paul Newman's greatest performances. While his character does not show the great range of emotions as other films such as ""Cool Hand Luke,"" or ""Nobody's Fool,"" he does put on quite a show. This is a must for anyone interested in Paul Newman."
5,Love it,"This is a CLASSIC Paul Newman movie. He gives such depth to his characters, and that makes his movies worth watching. Patricia Neal won Best Actress - I believe - for her role in this movie. She is such a good actress!"
5,Hud,"The first review of this film is so good, so complete, there is little that can be said following that. I have toadd that this film belongs to Melvyn Douglas, Patricia Neal, and Brandon Dewilde. These actors are more than actorsthey breathe life into what life was like before corporate american took over the world and franchised everything else. Paul Newman is his usually handsome self giving a ""go to hell"" performance that causes his father such aggravation and grief. However Paul pails in comparison to the first three.This is a classic movie in every sense of the word.... dont miss it, better yet Own it."
3,"Good, but Not That Good -","I'd always heard that this was an excellent movie. After finally seeing it, I'm unconvinced. The acting is fine, but Newman's role is not appealing. He's basically a jerk from one end to the other, trying to take advantage of his father, lacking concern for other farmers potentially getting hoof and mouth disease infection from his dad's cattle, attacking Patricia Neal, and chasing every woman in town. Didn't appeal that much to me."
5,HUD,Paul Newman received an Academy Award nomination for his performance as Hud.This was probably one of Newmans best performance's. I love this movie and own two copies on DVD it is a real classic.I would recommend this movie to anyone
5,Paul Newman Rocks!,"A great, great movie. A masterpiece that nobody knows about (except for the other reviewers below me). The black-and-white cinematography is enchanting, the music is wonderful, and every performance is memorable. The ending, with Newman slamming the door, is one of my favorites. By the end of the film, you feel like you really know the characters portrayed in this film. Ranks in my top 20 greatest movies of all time."
4,Paul Newman,If you like Paul Newman you will like this movie. Newman was nominated for a Best Actor award but did not get it. The movie did win three Oscars though including one for Patricia Neal. It is a must to own for any movie collector or for people that really like Paul Newman.
4,8-1/4 table saw likes & dislikes,"Building Items with the saw works very well as long as streight cuts are made. Ripping wood with this saw doses a super job. But on the other hand I bought a miter saw to do the angle cuts. The miter slot in the saw table is not deep enought to keep miter tool in slot. I would not recomend the stand made by the manufacture unless you are very small. (under 3' tall) The stand that I wood Recemend is in this catalog (RM-36-540u Trojan) this stand is for normal and tall people. (I am 6'3"" tall)This Trojan stand is portable and is it's own dolly no lifting to carry this unit.The Trojan stand I give it 5-STARS!"
3,Lack of character building and dull cases.,"This season. there some to be lack of character building and with the episodes alternating , there seems no fluidity or continuation in the stories especially in the main characters. A few of the episodes are rather dull,no surprises.Goren's and Eames strained relationship is not fully explored."
3,Not so hot,I really did not like this season. I found it boring and I guess I do not like the jumping back and forth between the detectives.Still in the tradition of law and order but for me a little less interesting.
1,"I love Bobby, the wife loves Logan.","G'day, You know how it is with your favorite show, the people become part of your family. The part with people you'd like to spend time with. Well, if you feel that way this is definitly worth getting. The best part is no comercials, YEA...."
3,"Victoria ""Lite""","This book is a reflection on the life of Queen Victoria by someone who is clearly fascinated by her and who probably knows everything there is to know about her. It is easy to read and does not require you to know a great deal about her already in order to make any sense out of the book.On the other hand, if you are already well-read about Victoria, this book, in my opinion, brings little that's new. But if you are willing to take the journey with this author and let him share his thoughts in the way usually reserved for a dear old friend, then you will find a pleasant un-bumpy ride along the way."
2,Book of Mormon Video Soundtrack,"This was a gift so I really have no idea how to rate it, since I didn't listen to it before giving it."
2,A Sci-fi Soap Opera with the emphasis on soap opera,"The story got maudlin to the point that I refused to finish it. I don't like soap operas. I knew better than to pick this up. From now on I'll listen to my inner 'don't go there'. It's not the book, it's me.. nah, it's the book"
3,"Good book, but not very original","*** Warning: SPOILERS ***I enjoyed this book, as I have enjoyed most of Bova's books. But I can't help thinking he ""borrowed"" a lot of ideas from Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Red Mars"". The sky tower, it falling, the critial levels on Earth, colonization of the planets/space, the wars, extended lifespans, etc... Yea, a lot of writers have written about these things, but there are just too many similarities between these two books."
3,Not horrible.,"A typical rehashing of the same old George Jones material that's been sold for decades at every truck stop. In this case, however, there's a ton of it! And at a low price! (This time with some much more recent live tracks thrown into the mix!) To be honest, there is no rhyme or reason to the tracks selected or to the sequencing. Sound quality varies from very good to just fair. (However, many of the poor sounding tracks are not available in better sound elsewhere. It's better to have them in crummy sound than not at all, right?)All in all, there's enough good stuff here for me to recommend this to The Possum's die hard fans. Newbies would be best served picking up Rhino's ""Best Of"" (UPC: 081227053123) and CBS's ""Anniversary"" (UPC: 074643832328)"
4,American Made is great,"The new American Made cd from Wakefield is really great. There's a good variety of music for everyone to enjoy. It's got the upbeat songs and the slow ones as well. Anyone who likes bands like Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, and Simple Plan should really check them out along with everyone else. It's a great cd from a great new band. Wakefield rocks!!!!"
2,"Sounds like Good Charlotte, but not nearly as good","Aaron Escolopio, the original drummer for Good Charlotte, should stayed with them instead of joining his younger brother's mediocre band. This album is nothing special and there is no musical merit or depth in this album. But it will fit perfectly into the TRL family. In 4 years from now, we won't be hearing about this band."
2,Bad and Completely Unoriginal,"When I listened to American Made I honestly couldn't tell any difference between Wakefield and bands like Mest and Simple Plan. They all sound the same and their songs aren't good. This has very immature lyrics to the songs, which are also way overproduced. They do have a few catchy parts here and there, which is why I gave 2 stars, but in general all the songs aren't memorable at all. Wakefield seem to be just another band trying to make it big following the current pop-punk trend. There is nothing here to make this disc worth your money or time."
4,Very Good CD,"It is true that this band may sound like a lot of other punk bands out there, but their creative and thought worthy lyrics make up for that big time. I don't think this band deserves to be critisized just for a cd, you need to see them in concert to get the full effect, then if you don't like them, say whatever you want to say. Comparing themselves to other bands doesn't mean they think they are as good as them, and even the last track they have many doubts when they say ""we suck, yea we're never gonna make it"". So, I think this is a very good cd and anyone who wants some upbeat music with good lyrics, listen to it or buy it!Thanks"
4,simple plan's twin,"they sound very much like simple plan.. but with a little more variety and with much better lyrics. if you're tired of simple plan's kiddy lyrics, listen to wakefield."
3,Not their best,"I've been listening to Wakefield since they started. I even remember the days in middle school when all the girls wanted Ryan and JD to sign their yearbooks after the talent show(it was a different band though). Their cd American Made is okay, but a lot of the demo cuts were actually better. I think the drums sounded better before they replaced Mark with Aaron. Overall the cd is okay. The coolest thing about the cd was how they dedicated it in memory of Scott Hoppe, who died in a car crash a month before the start of his senior year. I honestly think they can do better."
1,Terrible!,"This is basically a poor imitation of anything good that Good Charlotte and Newfound Glory have produced (which is pretty minimal). It's pure imitation, and it doesn't work. The vocalist doesn't even pretend to actually sing and instead decides to whine like a hyena. If you want some true quality punk music, pick up a Taking Back Sunday cd, not this junk."
2,You left Good Charlotte for THIS?,"Realistically, I'm just kidding (I would have left Good Charlotte to serve burgers). But in all honesty, this CD is horrible.Not a single song is very deep, I felt absolutely no empathy when I listened to any of the songs. Except possibly ""Un-Sweet 16"", under the circumstances that I'm sure the majority of the people that enjoyed this record were that age or under.For a far better record, check out their sophomore release, ""Which Side Are You On?"", which is absolutely FANTASTIC and I haven't taken it out of my CD player for days."
2,"A whole bunch of middle school ""Punk""","Man....i have never felt so jipped about paying ten dollars for a ceedee than this one. This band...well maybe i would have nejoyed their songs...IF I WAS STILL IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. Their songs sound quite lame just like the mtv ""punk"" bands good charlotte and new found glory. I mean...i like greenday, i like sugarcult and i likED simple plan and blink....but wakefield is just not that good. They just follow the ""succesful 'punk' band formula"" and they are perfect for being role models for middle schoolers who wear atticus and wristbands cuz they think they are so cool for being punks -_-Anyhow, only get this album if yur a die hard fan and you want somthing generic. If you awnt something more mature or different...stay away from this album...Faaaaar away."
1,Bad,i dont have this but my friends have made me listen to it many times and its really bad....i guess if u like mtv pop type punk then i guess youll like it but if your into actual punk this this is just another bad simple plan bad band.
2,Great If You Don't Plan To Wear It Often,"It's beautiful and I get many people tell me how pretty it is, but after you wear it a couple of weeks, it leaves a black mark around your finger that doesn't wash completely off for several days."
4,Red River - slow growing addiction,"I first heard of Red River from a review I read saying If you like Fushigi Yugi, then we recommend this. While me being huge fan of Yu Watase and all her works, especially fushigi yugi I decided to try this out even though it was not done by Yu .When I first picked up my volume one I was a little put off, The art didnt seem to be has nice, and the story seemed a tad off, but I kept reading and by the end I was hooked.I am such a sucker for the love story, true at first you think Kail is a jerk , but there is that under lying feeling of how much he cares and the sexual tension building up between them.But romance isnt the only thing, the fight and war front story sections are more than enough to hook the male readers.this is a very well rounded story and the artwork ,especially those of kail and yuri embracing are beautiful.I wa sglad to be proven wrong from my first impression.I just recently finished vol 4 and I am soo anxious for the next one to come out."
5,A great manga for any Shoujo fan!,"Although I found this in the adult section in the library when I was in 9th grade, I decided to give it a try and I was NOT disappointed. I absolutely love Red River! I bought the first three volumes awhile ago and am trying to save up some money to buy some more. They are thoroughly enjoyable and Chie Shinohara's artwork is amazing! I also like her other series Ryouko's Case Book of Spirits which is worth checking out if you like Red River. A must have to any Shoujo collector! :)"
1,Cheap charger,My son used this charger once for Sony W600 and when he tried to unplug it from his phone it broke. The end that plugged into his phone came apart. I feel that the $9 we spent was a waste and it is not worth paying for postage to get a new one.
1,Poorly Made,"After a month of use, the charger connector broke. Luckily, the broken piece was easy enough to pull out of my phone.The connector appears to be ""snapped"" together using friction-tabs instead of glue or screws. I suspect all of these chargers will eventually suffer from problems."
4,Great Pan for the Money,"Purchased this for our food business and we are very happy with it. Conducts heat well, cleans up easily, a high quality pan at a bargain price."
3,This is supposed to be a free part,"Kind of ridiculous that they charge what they do for a part that says in the included documentation it's supposed to be free. Unfortunately, if it's a discontinued item, they don't offer them for free anymore... Very nice faucet once you get the thin deck aid though."
1,Beware - incorrect Amazon.com documentation,"Beware: The Amazon.com documentations is wrong as it states that this is a print server and has an integrated network hub. However, it is NOT a hub so do not buy it if you need a integrated hub/print server as I did. If you look at the Netgear website, it correctly states that this product can connect to a hub..."
4,"Very good, but still has some minor problems.","I bought a new Canon i850 and wanted to use a printserver for it. I originally bought the expensive Linksys PPSX1v2 print server but the performance was slow, no bi-directional support, and no linux support. I returned it and bought the Netgear PS110. What a big difference! Its great! Great performance and I can print with my linux box too!I found two problems. 1) Doesn't support the bi-directional functionality of the Canon i850. 2) When I first received the PS110, it was set to DHCP disabled. So nothing could connect to it. I found out that in order to MANUALLY set the IP, you have to connect the printserver directly to your NIC with a crossover cable, then set the ip using the ""IPSetup"" tool."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"Sorry, but I found this book useless and uninspired. What's worse is that author is so desperate for sales he's written a stellar review of this book and then pasted it in the review section of various other P.R. books on amazon. I'm surprised that someone in public relations would use such an obviously tacky gimmick to sell his book.I suggest you buy:Guerrilla P.R. : How You Can Wage an Effective Publicity campaign...Without Going Broke, by Michael LevineWriting Effective News Releases...: How to Get Free Publicity for Yourself, Your Business, or Your Organization, by Catherine V. McIntyreWriting a Press Release: How to Get the Right Kind of Publicity and News Coverage, by Peter BartramMedia Training 101 : A Guide to Meeting the Press, by Sally Stewart"
4,Love and Death in Space,"Another excellent work by Mike Resnick. Told from the viewpoint of an alien (something most authors have trouble doing), this book spans the galaxy in the quest for the Dark Lady. Is she Death? Is she a Goddess? The Bjornn art dealer Leonardo is driven to learn all he can about her, and what she means for his future, the future of his race, and the future of Mankind."
5,bunny wailer is great!!,"I had this album on cassette that I bought yeaars ago. Could not believe it was on cd after all these years. The melodic soongs and thoughtfulness that is in each song make me play it over and over again. This cd is a must-get for those of you that like to escape on a cloud of reggae majic. Every time i listen to it, i am transported back to Jamaica!"
5,"Wonderful, cake-like brownies!!!","These are just delicious brownies. They are more cake-like to me that the brownies I grew up eating, which are ultra-rich and fudgy, but these brownies fill the void PERFECTLY!My son has allergies to peanuts, tree nuts and milder allergies to eggs, and so I really am thankful that I can have access to a boxed brownie that he can help me make (he can't help if I do anything with eggs) and that everyone LOVES to eat.Real Simple magazine ranked these at the top of their brownie-from-a-box list, and those included brownies that had the top allergens.My best friend, who has no food allergies, thinks these are the best brownies she's ever eaten. Pretty high praise!!!Thanks again, Cherrybrook Kitchen--your brownies and whole-wheat pancakes are life-savers--literally!!!! And tasty, to boot!"
2,Great Magazine but........................,"I have just purchased my first issue of Fast Bikes at a local book store and think it is one of the best out there. Unfortunately, the magazine is WAY too expensive. It is too bad that American publishers can't come up with a magazine like this to sell here at home at a cheaper price. I rate this magazine a full 5 stars but will give only 2 stars for the high cost. Therefore I will only continue to purchase 1 or 2 Fast Bikes magazines a year and not order a yearly subscription. It is not Amazon.com's fault, it's just that it has to come from the UK."
2,Sinister,"My two year old son is OBSESSED with all things Thomas. And he is terrified of this film. It's so sinister and creepy, and very dark. He hides under the chair in the corner, or he runs to his father or me and buries his face into our chests and cries when the diesel engines appear. And Percy is really sad in it a lot, which upsets him very much. He becomes devastated when Percy cries in the film. Percy is normally so upbeat, and he becomes a very depressed little engine. The music and mood is so dark and disturbing, and we really don't recommend it at all. It looses the innocence that is Thomas & His Friends."
5,Gee!!!,These are the Best movies for children. The movies teach lessons and morals to our children and for this I am thankful.
4,A pleasant story,I felt that this was a worthwhile story for my 4 year old. Usually I feel that the thomas' stories do little in the way of showing morals and values that can be easily talked about with a young child. However the recent string of movies from HiT entertainment has changed that. It was good to have a central story about friendship and honesty. He didn't find it scary at all as some others have said. There is a fire safety sub-theme going on too which is a good starter if you haven't brushed up on fire safety recently. Ultimately it held his attention and was something I found to be somewhat enjoyable too.
5,Keeps my toddler riveted!,"This is one of the only videos that will hold my 2 year old's attention the entire time (so it's great for when I need to prepare dinner!) And since that means, I also have to listen to it quite often, I was pleasantly surprised-the writing is actually pretty good, for this sort of thing. Quite poss the best Thomas movie ever made, so far. Worth the purchase (versus rental, which I do with some of the vids, to keep the rotation fresh)"
3,Don't buy it for the graphics,The book is very good for learning C++. One drawback though is that he bases many examples on earlier examples. That way it's hard to grab the book and open it up in the middle. Don't expect to learn much about graphics and absolutely don't buy the book for it. I haven't yet been able to understand that chapter. He introduce windows programming for the graphics without laying much of a foundation behind it.But if you don't care about the graphics the book is great.
1,This is a bad introductory C++ book,This is a bad introductory C++ book. It does NOT have muchto do with Computer Graphics. Don't buy it either for computergraphics or for learning C++ if you are a totally beginner.
5,IAm porud to say that I own it!,"I brought SWAT 3 off the shelif at Wal-Mart becuase it looked intresting and Iam glad I didThis is probly the best coumputer action game I have played in years!, The Elite Editon offers more levals tobut the game is hard without the cheat codes so I suggst goig to IGN.comand finding the codesThis game isth closet a lot of us will get to being on the LAPD SWAT TEAM."
5,MUY BUEN JUEGO!!,Yo recomiendo este juego de acción y estrategia en 1a. persona. Tiene muchas opciones que permiten hacer de este juego mucho mas agradable y entretenido. Proporciona muchas horas de entretenimiento y es bastante adictivo. Es una buena compra!
2,Great Idea-Flawed Game,"If you're looking, as I was, for a Counterstrike substitute, keep looking. Ultimately what kills this game is playability. The game play is not engaging. Graphics are lacking a bit--look at the way that everything LOOKS like a flat surface with a texture layed on it. Ultimately thats not a big complaint though, it looks passable. It's just not that fun."
2,"Great missions, wonderful setup, but awful action...","I bought 2 copies of the game... one for me and one for my friend. I shoved the CD into my system and installed, no prob. i got into the game, and i began the first mission... there was a realistic voice briefing me and it all was so amazing...until i got to the mission action. the actual action was slow, pixelated, and non-userfriendly. I can understand ther being a multitude of weapons, but having to memorize 12 buttons for equipment alone? also, i found that the levels became disorienting when dark rooms were present. In reality, if you took the mission setup from SWAT and the action from Rainbow 6, you would have yourself the most kickass game ever seen....overall, i don't recommend this game to anyone... it needs better controls, smoother graphics, and a more detailed storyline.and no, it is not my system.... i have a Pentium 3, 128 megs, 8meg vid card, and 800 megahertz packed into my desktop puppy."

3,Joy of Sex 2nd Edition,Useful but dated as I knew it would be. These books were written several years ago and they do a good job of instruction.
3,caldrea pine scent,"If you are buying strictly for the scent, lovely when wet, scent completely disappears when dry. softens adequately cures static cling."
3,Better than the speakers,"The book covers all the fundamentals, and while not as in depth as the Victor Marder tome,...it does help in teaching medical students and residents. Some of the chapters were written by faculty members of the University of Vermont. To tell the truth, the printed word is much more understandable than hearing the speakers in person. In all, a good book for learning the basics."
4,lida's electro masterpiece,"half her records are guitar based pop and half beat driven electro pop and this is the best of the latter. always her songs are simple but really catchy in an effortless way with just the right instrumental touches that flesh the songs out perfectly. like her best guitar records (fly sterephonic, joyride) it sounds like stuff that bunches of other people are doing, yet her charm is unique and you'll probably end up owning all her stuff while losing interest in her peers after two or three discs."
1,This is not for diabetics limiting their carbohydrate intake,"I have never felt compelled to write a book review before. However, after purchasing and reading this book, I thought it necessary to provide other diabetics with the knowledge that the recipes in this book are primarily low fat, high carbohydrate based. While this may be healthy eating for many people and many of the recipes, indeed, looked good, most of the recipes in the book would be inappropriate for me, an insulin dependent diabetic, who limits (but not eliminates)carbohydrate consumption. I was astonished that the primary focus of this book was to be low-fat with really minimal adaption for lower carbohydrates, merely the substitution of artificial sugar for the real thing. While lower fat is healthy, it it hardly the primary and only goal of a diabetic diet.I love cookbooks, but this was a complete waste of my money and went directly into the trash bin."
3,Good for elves...,"I think the recipes are fairly good; however, the serving sizes are a joke. FOUR raspberries to split among FOUR people for a dessert with raspberry in the name? ONE olive per person in a salad... gimme a break. Other 'BIG serving' recipes allow one cup of soup, or one half a sandwich. I don't believe in super-sized servings, but I do think more than three bites is appropriate. And, of course, if you eat more than the suggested serving, then the nutritional information isn't really all that useful, is it."
2,did i get the kindle version,i cant even get to the pages i want. i have to spend half hour with the next page button to find recipe i want. this is not a kindle version.
5,Diabetic gourmet cook book,"A great book with lots of good food. Very healthy, and good for you even if your not diabetic!"
1,diabetic coma,I've read through these recipes thoroughly and find I would be in a diabetic coma if I ate the amounts of sugars in them.I would not recommend this book for the true diabetic. It's more a diet weight loss book with recipes for low fat foods than it is for diabetics.
3,OK cookbook,"This cookbook is OK. I thought it would be better. Looked more interesting online than when I looked at it at home. I made one thing out of it so far as not really into anything in here. Will still make more, but was hoping for something that got me more enthusiastic to cook."
5,I never feel deprived.,"When I learned I was diabetic type 2, I cried when I thought I couldn't eat anything that tasted good. This book changed that. When I cook for my family or guests, nobody can tell their meals are diabetic. I love the variety this book has."
3,Good for starters,I like this book but wanted more pictures. There are other better cookbooks out there for diabetics. This one is fine and the recipes are nice but I wanted more ethnic type recipes and wanted to veer away from traditional recipes.
4,works as advertised,"I've been using this grater for the past year, mostly for cheese and things similar but also ocassionally as a zester since I don't have a true zester. Works fine as a zester. It does what it advertises and does it well. I'm very happy with the performance. However, there are two things I don't like about it. First of all, the metal grater is surrounded by hard plastic. If the metal part is not thoroughly dried, the metal can rust underneath the plastic. That's what is happening with mine. The other thing I don't like is that the plastic that surrounds the metal grater does not go all the way down the rubber handle; therefore, there is some flex in the handle. For most people, that shouldn't be a problem."
1,average life span 2 months,"Great tool. I use it almost every day. However, the plastic is very brittle. First one survived 2 months. I am on my second one and it's broken after 7 weeks. I would not recommend purchasing it. Consider the all metal alternative."
4,Microplane Grater,I loved this grater but mine broke. I was grating carrots and the carrot got stuck. After tugging a bit to get the carrot out it left a snag so now a piece of metal is sticking out. I tried to push it back in but each time I used it again it would pop back out. I eventually threw it away because I knew I would prob end up cutting myself sooner or later.
5,Microplane graters are the best.,These are the very best graters made. I now have three of them. This coarse grater is just what I needed.It could even be more coarse and I would be pleased. You can't go wrong with the Microplane....worth the money.
1,Save yourself the replacement cost; buy the professional version,"Fantastic Graters, Cheap Weak plastic... you'll love them enough to buy the professional ones when these plastic frames break after about one year. The extra cost is well worth the investment now."
3,NOT up to par,"Yes, this is still an improvement over box graters. However, it is not fabulous.CONS:1. Flimsy plastic construction. Hasn't broken yet, but it will.2. When grating hard cheese the blade tries to separate from the handle unless you put your index finger in the small hole on the plastic portion of the handle just above the handgrip.I would pass on this product and opt instead of all metal construction. I prefer both the Micro plane professional graters and the Cuisipro line."
3,Buy a Microplane - just not this one,"The Home series has some serious flaws that have led me to replace my old grater with the all-stainless steel professional version. The plastic frame on this model cracks with age, and on older versions, the handle fills with water when washed. The new version has a sealed handle, which is great, but the plastic frame just isn't up to the task. I still recommend the Professional line, which has a fully stainless frame and a rubber bumper at the end so you can rest the grater on a plate or cutting board. Both versions share the same excellent, sharp, broad grating surface that we all love."
3,Plastic breaks.,"These graters worked fine on zesting citrus or grating garlic cloves. But, once I used them (this one and the fine grater) for hard cheese (Parmesan, Romano, etc.), the plastic cracked on both of them. I would suggest you get one similiar to this model, but one that is made of all metal in the grater portion. Also, the handles have to be removed from these graters while washing (dishwasher or hand), because water collects inside and will not dry up unless the handles are removed and then allowed to dry completely. These graters have a couple of design flaws, which need to be addressed by the manufacturer."
2,handle snapped off after a few months of use,"This worked really well until the handle snapped off after 2 months of occasional use. I never put it in the dishwasher, either. Very disappointed."
1,Do not buy Microplane products if you live in Europe!,"Fantastic product, but way overpriced in Europe. The company website lets you order online, but has separate websites for both USA and Europe. You can only order from USA website if you live in USA. We europeans are forced to pay highly inflated prices of more than 120% markup (i.e. more than double) that of the prices on US website, and if you search around to shop in Europe you will find prices much the same.This company is controlling market prices and screwing us europeans with huge markups. It can get away with this because it is treating all european countries the same.Please don't buy this product if being treated fairly matters to you. It's the only way to get them to listen."
2,Ambient at its most unambitious,I don't mind sparse music but there has to be semblance of theme. Recording cool sounds may indicate some minimum degree of initiative but repeating them basically unaltered does not show much ambition or effort.
3,Sounds dated in 2004.,"Not at all ""the best ambient album out there,"" as stated elsewhere. Rather conventional, not modern."
4,Proficient and Inventive Ambient,"My favorite Spacetime Continuum recording is Emit Caps. This was an album which I expected would bore me to pieces. Instead, I have found that it is just enough different to keep me relaxed, yet interested in the sounds. Good stuff!"
3,Geology: ASelf teaching Guide,"This is avery basic introduction to Geology. If you have any background in Earth Science, you'l fend this book too basic. If your just interested in scratching the surface of geologic processes then this is the book to have. I felt the questions at the end of each section a bit simplistic, even childish. It is not the book for serious study of geologic processes."
2,The Only Book You Will Buy On the Topic,"I took a geology course in college over three decades ago and wanted to refresh my learning, so I chose this book based on a number of recommendations.The book takes the fun and wonder out of Geology. The fundamental processes that have in the past and continue to shape the earth are the topic of the book (good stuff). The simplistic way it is presented however, leaves wanting to read a second one. There is no joy in this book, just simple and dry."
2,Not realistic looking,This was going to be a great gag gift. Unfortunately the color is nowhere near flesh tone. It looks more like the orangy color you'd see on someone who used a cheap skin tanning product.
2,Seams in seat coming apart after light use,"We've had this bench now for a little over a year, and the seams on the seat are coming apart in four separate places. The only people who sit on it are my 6 yo and 9 yo, neither of whom is large or rowdy while sitting. Also, one of the rubber feet regularly slides off whenever the bench is slid on the floor (every time a child pulls it out to practice) and has to be replaced, or else the metal scratches our wood floor. Otherwise the bench is a good size and stows neatly. Just wish the seat was better quality."
4,KT7800 Plus Keyboard Bench,"I'm a big guy, 6'5"" and about 265. I find that I'm quite easily accommodated on this bench. It holds up and the padding is comfortable, whereas the legs are steady. It can really work for someone tall too. I would give 5 stars, but I'm picky and need to see how it holds up over time - not that it looks like it will break down, but time will tell."
3,Pretty good for the price :),"This bench is pretty good for the price. It has three settings, though if you're not careful, it feels just slightly like it's leaning or crooked when you sit on it. It's sturdy enough, though, and works well for my students who need a higher bench :)"
3,Good,"Like the bench, easy to install. However feel like the screws get loose sometimes and make the bench collapse. Also not too stable for carpet."
2,Bad smell,I don't really like it. There is bad smell came out of the cushion which made me wanna throw up! Bad for your health.
3,Kind of disappointed,"I ordered this because I was in desperate need of a piano bench. I love the design its very easily adjusted and comfortable to sit in. (I'm 6'4 if you need height comparison). Only complaint is out of the box I had a tear in the corner of the material covering the seat. I don't really want to go through the return process since its a lot of down time, but I thought it should be brought to peoples attention. Other than that I have no complaints. A solid bench."
1,Dissatisfied,"I'm dissatisfied with this bench. It's way too tall, even on the lowest setting, and I'm only 5'3"". The pad also came with spots on the seat. It appeared to be used. The box it came in was all taped up and looked re-used. As long as the goods inside were undamaged and in new condition, it wouldn't have bothered me. But again, the pad had spots on it, and there was no manual or anything that came with it, which I find odd. Even your simple toaster comes with directions or warranty of some sort. If I had purchased this at a local store, it would definitely be returned. Unfortunately, I don't want to have to pay for shipping to get a new one when the bench itself was about $30. I'm going to have to think about this one..."
4,"Inexpensive, practical bench","Comfortable enough for hour long play sessions, easy to set up and durable. Not much to it, but it's not the star of the show, is it?"
2,problem with the foam,"The bench is easy to set up and very stable as previous reviews said, but the foam is saggy. I need constantly to move my body a bit to keep my wrist position on the keyboard. That is annoying. I would not buy it if I had known this problem earlier."
5,"Very sturdy, excellent bench!","I purchased this bench from Amazon for my Yamaha Piano Keyboard. The reason I picked this particular bench was because of the good reviews and the capability to adjust it for height.The bench is so much better than described. The padding is thick and the height is adjustable to 8 different levels so you can get the perfect height for you. Even though there are only four holes on each side for the adjustments, because of the way the legs are designed, you can get 8 different height adjustments and the bench is still level.Another reviewer mentioned that it is not sturdy on carpet, but I disagree. Mine is on carpet, and I have not had a problem with it tipping. And I only weigh 109 lbs. It feels very stable on a carpeted surface.All in all, I am very happy with this Stage KT7800 Plus Keyboard Bench. If you are looking for an excellent bench, the value of this one exceeds the price!"
4,Excellent bench,"Well-made, easily adjustable, and thickly padded. This bench meets my needs perfectly, easily accommodating my ample frame. Assembly was a snap."
5,Nice Bench!,This is my third bench and seems to be the best of them. Quick to set up / tear down / adjust. The bench is also larger than my others. Very happy for the price. 4 different height adjustments.
5,Great Bench,"This arrived yesterday (another early shipment) and the bench looks great! I didn't want something that would take up a ton of space and would work for my height (6'7""), this bench seems perfect! It is nicely paded and I was surprised how easy it was to ""click"" the adjustable legs into place.....took less than 5 minutes to open the box, unwrap, and set up. Glad I made this purchase to go with the On Stage Keyboard Stand, they look and work well together!"
2,Seat size,I returned this item - the seat size is listed as-----------------------------------------------------Product FeaturesWeight Capacity: 360 lbsCushion Thickness: 3 inchesBench Seat Size: 12-1/2 x 23-1/2 inchesHeight in center position: 20 inches---------------------------------------------------However when you get this item in your hands & read the label on the bottomof the seat it is reallyWeight Capacity: 300 lbsCushion Thickness: 2 inchesBench Seat Size: 12.59 x 17.3 inches-------------------------------------------------------I dont want a seat this small - for some reason thethe longer bench seat are much more comfortable -particularly over a long period of time .Otherwise the product did look like it was well made .
5,Keyboard Bench,Thank you for the fast service. The bench is even better than I had hoped for. Great design and quality overall. I love it. I will look forward to doing even more business with you in the future. I hope this review helps others make their selection.
4,easy to assemble,The keyboard bench was easy to assemble and feels comfortable. The height adjustments are solid so there is no problem of changing it back and forth to accomodate different size players.
5,"Sturdy, supportive and flexible","Have been using it for playing piano and synth for a few months now and am very happy with it. The seat has thick, firm padding that provides the right mix of comfort and support for me. The range of heights has been good for a variety of applications. Overall I'd say it is an excellent value.I like that it not only uses thick spring-loaded pins to adjust the height, but also has large thumb screws to ""lock in"" each pin - am confident that it is sturdy and will not move/slide/whatever when I sit on it. This does add an extra step when setting up/tearing down, but this has not affected me since I don't take it out much currently. Might be different for a gigging musician."
5,Plus Keyboard Bench,"Delivered on time and in the original unopened box from Music People. After having used a drum throne for sitting behind the keyboards, this bench is well worth the money! Wrapped in the original plastic bag, I found this bench to be defect free. Assembly is just snapping in the cross brace legs in the selected retainer holes under the bench. With ample foam cushing, just adjust to suit your comfort height behind the keyboards and enjoy hours of playing. And yes this bench is portable. Release the cross brace from the bench and away you go. Anyone considering a bench will be pleased with this one."
3,Comfortable bench,"This is mostly a nice product, firm comfort and big enough for two people to squeeze on for duets etc. Only issue is the rubber feet keep falling off when you move the bench. No biggy, I will probably glue them on when it anoys me enough."
5,Did not expect something this high quality,"It's not even just about the extremely reasonable price on this bench - the construction is fantastic, it's well designed, and took less than a minute to put it together out of the box without looking at the instructions. The cushion is thick and firm, and I'll update this review if that ever changes."
3,2nd one is great,"Like another reviewer, the first bench I received had a bent leg. However, the replacement arrived quickly and is just what I needed to give my smaller piano students a boost!"
4,Sturdy Little Bench,The bench is sturdy and a quick setup. Height adjustment is easy and you can easily close the bench and put it away. I put a cloth over the seat for comfort. It's a good deal. I'm satisfied.
4,I wish it folded flat,"Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. Made of quality material, sturdy, and plenty wide. I also like the height adjustment. I have it permanently set up with a keyboard, but wish it would fold up flat for convenience. I would buy again."
4,"Great value, seats high for your youngest students","I have been happy with this bench. I bought it for my young piano students because its highest setting is a very healthy 25"", enough for even my shortest students.The bench is a very good value. It has two minor quality issues that one might expect from a bench of its cost: the rubber feet keep slipping off, and once, the screw holding the adjustment peg came undone (this was not dangerous, just annoying). Also, adjusting the bench is not as simple as it might be on more expensive models. However, I recommend this sturdy bench for anyone who needs a cost effective way to get their young piano students sitting higher. I own two of them."
5,Excellent quality!,We have this for a month now and very happy! Cushion is thick and very comfortable. Ordered for my 6 year old. Very comfortable even for adults as its wide. Good price too!
1,also baited and switched!,"Like Todd, I received the ""guardian"" bench, not the one on the website, even though I ordered directly from Amazon Prime because of his review. In addition, the stool had clearly made the rounds on the order-return circuit: The box was beat up, there were absolutely no labels/logos anywhere, and the item was already assembled and scratched up. In addition, the stool they sent is 3"" too short (had ordered the ""on stage"" one because it's the height I needed). Called to complain, and they are sending me a new one to see if it's ""the right one this time!"" We'll see tomorrow..."
2,wobbles and the 4 pins didn't line up,"Unfortunately the bench we received was not constructed well, or had a manufacturing issue. The 4 pins did not all line up. With considerable effort (and force), we were finally able to get the pins to go into the holes. As you can imagine, pulling them out was equally challenging, making it impractical to adjust easily/quickly. The stand was also not welded correctly, so the bench wobbled. We are returning it."
3,Item was damaged; hard to change setting,"Despite the great reviews for this item, when it arrived, there was a tear in the vinyl covering on the bottom edge and some of the wood was chipped due to mishandling at some point. Also, when I installed the seat top and when to change the height, I practically had to pound one of the sliding bars to get it to release."
2,Smells Terrible!,This stuff really works but unless you want your home smelling like a terrible chemical industrial plant do not use it for indoor plants. I tested it out by spraying it on my cats favorite plant and brought a piece back inside. He instantly sneered. This is wonderful and I am so glad it works! I just wish it did not smell so bad because now I can not bring my plants back inside until they air out. I hope the sun does not kill them!
1,Didn't work for me,"I should have known when I saw my cats batting the can around like it was a toy that this wasn't going to be very effective cat repellant.The odor was tolerable, in fact I hardly noticed it unless I was right on it. My girlfriend who is fussier then I am said it smelled horrible. I don't know. I barely noticed it.What I did notice was the fact that my cat's completely ignored the stuff. I sprayed it on our door to keep them from rushing to the door when we open it. When I cam home from work, ran right up like always.I'm giving this product one star because it seems to have no effect whatsoever on my cats."
1,Avoid,"This is awful Some kind of terribly anynomous 60-ish pop music accompies the low quality footage which has no relation to the Beatles excluding some interviews with the Beatles which you may have seen in MUCH better quality somewhere else. Like I said, avoid it, buy the Anthology videos instead."
3,Joseph of Nazareth,Lovely movie. Not in the same production as Jesus of Nazareth but is was a very nice movie to watch.
2,not for men,"This chair is very sturdy, but is not for anyone over 5'8. The back is short and it angles back very little. You get the feeling you are sitting in a class room chair. Sorry.....but I love the rocking chair!"
5,Pleased,We purchased these chairs to fit into our camper. They are well constructed and compact in design. They are also heavy duty with steel frames.They're absolutely perfect for what we needed.
5,Sturdy but comfortable and very affordable chair,"We bought both the straight chair and the rocker to match, and we are delighted with both of them. They are so comfortable, slightly wider than the average patio chair. Definitely recommend!"
1,"This film clicks nowhere, a waste of Spencer Tracy","This film does not work at all. Toto doesn't even help it. A very poorly conceived and executed plot. A morality tale probably due to the lynching of primarily African-Americans that were still occurring in the thirties.. The only thing interesting about the film, but even then does not save it, is the gaunt appearance of the depression era characters."
4,Great Spencer Tracy Movie,Recommend to anyone who is a Spencer Tracy fan. This movie is a little different for him...shows what a great actor he was.
4,That good old American sport...Lynching.,"This movie is an indictment of it of course. Quite common in the 30's. This is the first film of Fritz's Lang's American period & it seems like he's got the lingo down pretty good.Briefly, Tracy plays a good guy, wrongly accused of a terrible crime by the residents of a small town. The evidence is highly circumstancial but the townsfolk want to lynch him & burn down the jail to get at him. He escapes & is presumed dead.The townsfolk are broadly drawn as xenophobic, intolerant & quick to judge the world outside their little orbit.Tracy's acting goes over the top, his character changing 180 degrees. One of his better efforts, however & that's saying a lot."
2,A character flaw,Wnated to continue the fun and tragedy of Upstairs / Downstairs but was dissapointed that the characters did not develop beyond their introductions from the original.
2,I got what paid for from the west coast,"I got what I paid for the product was one-third the catalogue price. In addition the content of the DVD was was I didnt like The box was old. I have eaten the product by disposal. Do not contact my gmail or my adress about it, it is gone!!!"
3,"With reservations, be advised","As I have stated in my review of ""Love Into Three Won't Go"" Acting is simply great, story lines are very well done and enjoyable, BUT you have to get over not having a wrap up or a tie in from story to story. Each one stands alone and I will add each one is very enjoyable on it's own. As to the end of the series ""Love Into Three Won't Go"" I say don't watch it as it leaves a very important question unanswered."
5,Charming Collection of Styles; Good source of Inspiration,I enjoyed the book. I've been struggled with how to decorate some space and more important how to communicate with my decorator; we sat dwn and went thru this book together and it helped clarify my vision for my personal/private space.
3,A little flimsy but the get the job done,These stockings don't seem to be constructed as thick or sturdy as the beige ones but they do work.
5,Tear Jerker,"This is one of my most highly recommended books. It brings the reality of my job as a mother to life. It gives the emotions (and I'm not one to base things off of feelings), reality and truth of the responsibility and influence mother's have on the hearts of their children. If you cherish the souls of your children and desire to obey the Lord in training them, READ THIS BOOK! It will bring you motivation when you have none."
5,The classic book of encouragement for moms,"This book is a rare find for any mom who wants to excel in her raising of her kids. It focuses on common mistakes parents make and the most reasonable means to solve them. This book is hard to find, I have been looking for it for more than a year. Don't pass it up, you won't be disappointed."
1,Swisher sweeps - some of the time,"The sweeper is very easy to assemble. The instructions are easy to follow. All of the parts are of good quality. My disappointment started when I first used the sweeper. The hopper has a 12 cubic foot capacity. However, as the clippings are swept into the hopper, it begins to spill out of the front when only about 1/3 to less than 1/2 full causing very frequent stops for dumping. Soon after my first use, the wheel that drives the brushes began to ""lock up"" unexpectedly, creating big long divots in the yard. I lubricated the wheel, but to no avail. When the item was working, it was OK. But the two or three times I used it behind my ride-on mower, it caused more problems than it solved. The item is too big to disassemble and return easily. I'm not sure what to do at this point."
3,"Good product, poor packaging.","Ordered this item, got it pretty fast with the amazon prime shipping upgrade. Problem was, the tray that catches debris was damaged in shipping, it's a sheet of plastic maybe 1/10"" thich and suffered a fatal blow by the assembling hardware rattling around in the box during shipping. Now the return process is pretty simple, except that a replacement won't be available for another month..."
5,Great unique tin sign.,This is a great product for the Victory Motorcycle entheusiast. It has the appearance of an old tin sign but it is only a picture. There is no rust on the sign and it the paint/picture is very unique.Whom every though of this did a great job.
5,"Not jeweler grade, but great for me ...","I did buy 2 of these at the time I ordered to have a spare so I wouldn't have to spend so much on shipping if I lost or broke one.I only need to change my band maybe once every 4-5 years, so the quality of this tool is fine for me.If I could find a place to do my watch band replacements near my home, then I would not have bought this, but I can't find anyone to do it so I will do it myself from now on."
3,A decent tool,"This is a good tool to have, but while using it the small link remover bit became bent. It still works but I worry it may break completely"
2,You get what you pay for,I wouldn't recommend this for someone who has a lot of springs and straps to change. The tool feels very cheap and flims in your hand. When I pulled the tool of the box the pointed end was slightly bent (I was able to straighten it). the tool functions ok and works for what I need it for. I cant imagine it lasting too long.
1,Waste of money,Don't buy this tool. It is cheap and hardly worth the effort to purchase it especially since the shipping is so ridiculous for this. Buy something of higher quality. Mine broke on the first use.
2,Breaks Easily,"I bought this item a month ago because I needed some of my watches' bracelets shortened. Immediately when I got it, I tried it out and thought it was a pretty good product. After using it on a second watch bracelet, the needle (the part used to push out bracelet springs) broke off. It's a good thing I purchased a back up spring bar. If you want this product, then go ahead and purchase it because it's cheap, but be ready when it breaks. I suggest you order at least two to save on shipping."
3,Handy tool for changing watch straps.,Tool does what it was designed to do - simple and intuitive. Use for strap springs ONLY! Point end will break off if you try to use it for bracelet pin removal. Good tool to have.
1,Watch Spring Bar Remover,This didn't work. It immediately broke. I ended up using a very small screw driver and that did the job.
1,Useless,"The pin on the end broke the first time I used it. It went in, released the pin and when I pulled it back, the tip stayed in the watch hole. The other end, the forked pry tool is too big for anything other than a 1970's era pulsar LED watch. Next time I will get a Bergeon brand."
1,Weak plastic on tool.,The band was too much for the grade of plastic used for this tool. The plastic and metal broke. Seller was more than happy to replace or whatever was needed to resolve the problem.
2,Get what you pay for,"For the price of this item , it's alright.Metal used seems low grade.The fork is large and useful for watch bands like Seiko divers. The push pin works but seems soft and can be bent.Calibration on the ruler is accurate though.Ergonomics are right and would give the novice user confidence to work on a easy to reach push pin.Hobbyist and pros might want to spend the extra money on a tempered steel tool at 10 times the price."
3,Works but no magic solution,This tool may be a bit better than a jeweler's screwdriver but installation is still very difficult. Don't expect a quick repair!
2,cheap MIM material,"cast pot metal MIM material, broke second time I used it, tips will break off easily, spend more get a better made product, nice tool as far as design and concept. Good vendor, they are accurate and ship fast. Would not buy again. If you don't know what MIM is look it up on Google, it's an inexpensive way to make cast metal products, this is not a precision milled product from forged steel like I thought it would be. Cheapo import"
2,"works... (well, sort of)","i have Luminox watch. the factory pins are spring loaded on one side only, the Paylak spring bar remover didn't quite work very well... in fact, it pretty much tore-up the lip thing that it's designed to compress to allow the pin to free itself from the hole where it ""sits"". i'm no engineer, but i think the ""v"" shaped end (designed to release the pin(s)) is a bit too thick (in my judgment), and as a consequence, too ""beefy"" for intricate work on a $400+ watch. after much fuss, i finally used needle nosed pliers and simply pulled the pins out with force (thus, trashing the pins which had to be replaced, which, in turn, seems to render the product useless). otherwise, it's sturdy, well built, etc. but could use a ""re-design"" to accommodate the tight area involved w/ its application). on the plus side, seller was reliable/ good nonetheless - i'd give them 5/5 stars."
2,not that good,"This didn't work as well as I thought it would. I tried to put a rubber dives band on my seiko kinieic and it I could get it on. I read a review on the seiko kinitec and the guy said it was difficult to do and I'm a believer, so that could be part of the problem. I'd get the smaller ss one for better handling."
4,Watch band spring bar remover,This tool has worked very well and makes changing out watch bands an easy task. The tool is easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone who changes their own watch bands. Amazon provide good customer service and prompt delivery .
4,yoga,"I practice yoga every morning so I was sure there would be some good ideas to help me sleep.. all the poses were familiar to me and the book is good for anyone who knows yoga or has never done it before. ""sleep well"" :)"
3,video,The complete colletion of the title is in great condition and the storyline of the video is good with good action.
3,Tamagotchi Truth,"Not cool. You might think it's cool to connect with friends but let me tell you this. They interupt with school work, they are constantly relying on you, they break really fast and you have to buy stinking bateries 24/7 (If you keep restarting it, belive me, you will). Also, you have to make shure it does not die. Who wants a tamagotchi pet if it dies? I mean, if you don't have a pet, and you get a virtual pet, you don't want to deal with that. REAL pets don't rely on you that much. And your tamagotchi has TOOTHACHES? Thats pushing it."
1,Too Boring,"For the first few days that I had my Tamagotchi I liked it. But, I think that the Tamagotci dies too quickly and is not too much fun to play with. There are not enough games to play. You earn points by playing games but if your Tamagotchi dies, you lose all of them! My Tamagochi was an adult, it had a lot of pionts and items, but when I stopped playing withit for only an hou, it died! I was very dissapointed. Now it is left alone and never played with because it is too boring! I do not think that you should waste your money on a pointless toy."
4,My daughter loves it.,"Its the newest toy in school. my daughter had to have it & it was sold out at our local toy stores. i'm glad you shipped it right away. thanks,"
4,It's okay.,"I got this toy from wal-mart, because, i couldn't find anywhere else to get it. I first got it and it was really fun. I still like it. You can play games on it, feed it, give medicine, etc. however, i don't think it is at all educational, it may seem like it, but it isn't. This is nothing like caring for a real animal. However, it is really fun, and okay, I guess. I'm glad i got it."
5,tamagotchi version 3s are fun and cool,"if you want a fun toy and you know how to take care of electronical pets you should try a tamagotchi I have every version up to #3 I have 2 version 1's 1 version 2 1 version 3 and me and my friends love them all together we have 13. so please take my advise and try 1 out and i bet you. You will like it .thank you and please try 1 heather (me) ,lauren,stephany,nikki,and breanna"
3,Strange,"Loved the classic Corduroy story, Yo, Yes and Here Comes the Cat. However, I was very disappointed with the bonus story. The story, The Rainbabies is very disturbing and extremely inappropriate for children. It frightened my daughter."
1,Awful - Ruined a children's classic,"How is it possible to turn a delightfully illustrated children's classic into a cheesy, live-action '80s DVD with absolutely none of the charm, or even the basic premise, of the original? It would have been so easy to just copy what the book did. This is an absolutely dreadful dramatization of a wonderful children's book. It's a horrible conception from start to finish - first, why not animate (or at least use the book's terrific illustrations)? Then, why alter a wonderful story, and add cheesy cartoonish action? The Corduroy bear could have had a cute voice and at the very least repeated the lines from the book. Instead, he is frankly like a horror-film bear -- he had my husband and me laughing and groaning, at the same time. My son, a huge Corduroy fan, lost interest after the first minute.Scholastic, shame on you for letting this dreck muck up your prestigious reputation. It's not worthy of the title Corduroy, let alone the brand Scholastic."
1,Fake perfume!!,This was not the perfume that is normally sold in stores. I don't know what it is but it was a rip off
1,fake of real chanel,i cant believe i paid that much money for a fake Chanel. Bottle looks actually real and even the smell is the same but then u realize its no where closer to the real one in strength and after one minute you cant smell anything which sux so much. i think so amazon should have some check up on its third party sellers that what they are selling.its too late to return coz she started using it like after 3 months so cant do anything with this now. but beware any fragrance don't buy it online if you don't want to get ripped off
1,Probably not authentic.,"The scent was not the Coco scent (my wife has been using Coco for many years). The labels were sloppy and badly printed and the ""Coco"" font was not right (we have side-by-side photos)."
1,package leaked,"Unfortunately, when the package arrived, perfume had leaked all over the place. Another bottle was sent, a different brand, and it leaked exactly the same way. There was no refund or further exchanges. ."
1,FRAUD ALERT - DO NOT PURCHASE,"I gave this product to my wife for Valentine's day only to discover that it is a fake. There are clues on the bottle, such as a missing Chanel watermark on the label, a missing trademark registration next to the Chanel name, and an off-set, smudged CC emblem on the collar of the perfume bottle. MOST DAMNING EVIDENCE - THE PROOF OF THE PARFUM IS IN THE SMELL: After buying my wife a replacement bottle from the local department store and comparing the two side by side, I can tell you that the product purchased through Amazon is not a great perfume. The department store bottle smells sweet and floral, whereas the this product purchased through Amazon Marketplace smells of scented hotel soap. It is harsh, by comparison. I am trying to contact the seller to ask for a refund and -- surprise, I get no response. Looks like I'm out $77 -- don't let this happen to you."
1,Never reveived merchandise,"I did not receive my order for COCO Chanel Perfume that was to have came from 1stPerfume. I E-Mailed them two times and never heard from them. I know I will never get my $72.00 back that has been charged to my credit card, but I learned a lesson from all this. From now on I will go to a store and make my purchases and have my merchandise in hand. If there is a problem I know I can go to the store and get it taken care of."
1,Fake perfume,"That was a dirty trick: I paid real money & I got the fake perfume. Usually Amazon sellers are decent people but not this seller - awful product, fake through & through!"
1,Fraudlent perfume seller,Should of read the reviews first!!! This coco perfume was fake the label even said Eau De FARFUME and the labels on the bottle didnt even match the real bottle i already have at home i got from maceys I cant believe amazon lets this seller on their web page I have bought off amazon for 9 years and now what??? Im incredilious this happened!!!
1,Fake,"my wife insists this does not smell like the real thing, and is convinced it is a fake. Bottle looks real enough however. Caveat emptor."
3,Minnie Mouse Dress,Cute Minnie Mouse dress my 3.5 year old loves it. Its very thin material so good for a warm country or summer but not sure how long it will last. The ears are useless.
3,My daughter loved this costume....,My daughter loved this costume and had fun playing with it. I was slightly disapointed with its quality but she had fun which was the main thing!
4,Nice costume for wearing a few times,The colors were great and the item arrived on time. Its quite a fragile dress so more of a costume that can be worn a few times only. I would suggest to buy another minnie ears as the one provided doesnot stay intact and just sleeps to the back and quite small. But love the dress.
3,mini mouse costume for kids,The costume was well liked by my daughter who is in the 4th grade. It came in a timely manner and the cost was okay.
2,Bad quality but will do the job,"I ordered this costume for my two year old and it arrived today. I read previous reviews about the costume running small so I bought the 3T-4T size, this is a little big for her but the 2T wouldn't have fit at all. The costume is cute but I agree with other reviewers, the quality is pretty bad (threads hanging out in multiple places) and part of the costume is torn (the top part and the bottom part have detached). I don't have time to send this back and wait for a new one so I'm going to fix it myself. The costume will do the job for this year but I doubt it'll last longer than this weekend. I guess you get what you pay for. Also, not sure if it's comfortable or not, my daughter wore it for about 5 minutes and then asked for it to be taken off."
3,Gift for Son in Law,I still haven't received feed back on this CD from my son in law. He is a Minnesota born singer song writer and I thought he would enjoy hearing this music.
3,100 animal anecdotes,Quite good. Great to dip in and out of.Enjoyable and touching on many occasions. Ideal for adults and children alike
1,Smells good but that's it,"One of the least expensive hair conditioners on the shelf. Great smell but is a horrible conditioner for hair. Disappointing but if you read the ingredients its a chemical brew. Try it and see if you have better results, it's sure cheap"
5,totally hilarious,"This is a book that u can read over and over again, and you'll laugh each time. Too bad its not that popular, the author is a genious. I read this book at the age of 16, I am now 21 and I still love it."
3,"Not so great, but not too bad...","I suppose one can just enjoy the book simply for its thriller element spiced with some juicy bed scenes. but, after reading this, i must admit that it wasnt that satisfactory. i really cant put my finger on where exactly it was lacking but...maybe...there needed to be more passion/emotion and a bit more focus on the romance facet, rather than on the hunt for the bad guy.suffice to say, though, it's not really one of ms. kane's masterful novels, but it's not that terrible either. lol "",)"
3,OK,"Nothing stellar, but the story was OK. In general I liked the 2 main characters and all the sub-characters, including Breanna's cousin, Stacie and her husband (from 'The Gold Coin'). The women's lives are in deadly danger, their husbands just happen to be the most capable men in England, an assassin is trying to hunt them...at the height of danger what do the women do? Sneak away from their guards and experienced protectors, run out into an open field determined to hunt him down. What do you think happens? He catches them of course. Give me a break. And they are trying to prove that they're not stupid useless females?... Weak over-used finale plot device detracted from a pretty good story."
5,A wonderful sequel!,"I was so excited to finally get the chance to read The Silver Coin. After finishing The Gold Coin, I was terribly impatient to wait for it to arrive in Canada. When it finally did, I quickly snatched a copy from Chapters and took a break to read it. And boy, the wait was worth it! I truly enjoyed this novel: Ms.Kane did a wonderful job tying ends together, and the love story between Breanna and Royce was wonderful and satisfying! Ms.Kane has the ability to write mystery and romance, all packed into one novel. The suspense was intriguing and the wonderul hero Royce, was always around to protect his beloved was remarkable. Their love shines all throughout the novel, and the characters takes the reader on a journey with them.If you've never read a novel by Ms.Kane before, you must read the Coin Series. This is her writing at her best!"
3,a doctor as a hero,"This is Linda Howard's Bluebird winter (1987) as a new release. The hero is a doctor (? ) which is something new for Howard. I found this one the best in sequels, Sarah's child and Almost forever. But something is missing. This book is from the same period like Diamond bay and I waited all the time when hero changes to some kind of spy or something mystical. But all the time he was just an ordinary doctor who happens to fall in love with a poor girl. The story was ok, but nothing special.Buy the way... Linda Howard is releasing August 2000 SIM A game of Chance. Who might be the hero...? I am looking forward to it."
3,Not the greatest,Not the best mix of authors in a book. I like Howard books and that is why I read this.
3,Ok!,"It got a little bit spilled when it was mailed. The bottle has problems and the product doesn't arrive full. I personally prefer gels, I feel like they clean my skin better."
5,LOVE IT!,Onofri is to Vivaldi what Milstein was to Bach-I can only say he seems to play Vivaldi with a unique understanding and approach that makes already wonderful Vivaldi literally melt in my ear...I love this CD!
5,Great.,"This book is full of action and keeps you turning pages. That's what I look for. books I can't put down. I rate it up with Savage heat, Fantasy Lover, and Anything, My Love by Cynthia Simmons. All books you can't help but love."
5,The Beautiful Midwest from an Architectural Angle,"This book is like a treasure box. When opened it reveals the beauty of the midwest from an angle that not too many people have thought of. The photographs make you look at structures in another way,thus opening up a whole new ""treasure box"" when you begin seeing these architectural elements in real life no matter where you are--Midwest or not! It's even more exciting to take a road trip and actually drive by these featured homes and buildings. This is a must for those renovating victorians,those partial to victorians,and those interested in preserving the old structures in your town. If you are a RAGBRAI rider (The Register's Great Annual Bike Ride Across Iowa)and have been captivated with the simple beauty of Iowa,this book will open up yet another avenue of enjoyment as you proceed through the small towns of the state."
1,crappy incomplete plans for a junk gun,"I ordered this to gain insight into just what is needed to manufacture an automatic firearm. What I got was 8 pages of photocopied scale drawings of individual parts, not even a complete set of drawings at that. The ""plans"", contain incomplete specifications for the receiver, no instructions for assembly or fitting of the parts. Not even a drawing or picture of a completed weapon. Anyone ordering this with the idea of actually using these plans for anything more than bird cage liner, save your money."
3,Poorly constructed,"I've wanted one of these for a while having used others. I didn't look very closely when I placed the order for this, but the frame of the grater is plastic and somewhat flimsy especially compared to the all stainless versions that I've used. The grater itself works fine and was very sharp when I got it, but I wonder how long the frame will last. Probably, I should've looked more closely and purchased the ""Pro Series""."
1,plastic degrades in 6mo,"This plane is rather expensive for handheld but the blade seemed really nice so I bought one. It also said ""Made in USA"" so I figured the quality was superior. I was wrong. Although the plane shreds cheese, chocolate, veg, etc very well, there is a huge flaw in this unit. The blade is held in by clear plastic that degrades over a short period of time (6-months). On my unit all the clear plastic has cracked and the unit is falling apart. The plane is supposed be ""dishwasher safe"" but it is not. The heat from the dishwasher is what caused the plastic to crack allover. I always washed it on the top shelf, farthest away from the dryer heating element. But still the unit got ruined. If you get this shredder/plane I suggest washing it by hand only."
2,Great until you wash in the dishwasher,"I loved this item. I purchased from another discount store, (not Amazon). Works fantastic, nice large size for grating orange peal, or other large items. However, after washing in the dishwasher a few times, the handle cracked, and then broke.Highly recommended if you wash dishes by hand, otherwise stick to the molded handle without the acrylic, (which disintegrated in the dishwasher)."
2,Crap-ola,"Plastic is broken all the way around, making this rather expensive gadget both obsolete and dangerous. Poor design. Less than 1 year old. Disappointed, replacing with oxo. Worked well when brand new but did not last over 20 uses. Junk junk junk."
2,"Wonderful grater, terrible plastic housing","I've been through so many of these microplane graters but am only just figuring out that one should never, never buy from their so-called ""Home Series"" because no matter how much you coddle and hand wash it, the plastic surrounding the grater will surely and inevitably crack and break. The grating action is superb but only buy the professional series or another that is all metal. I'm fed up with the plastic being so crummy; my lastest one is breaking after about a year of use, which included only hand washing it. Frustrated."
3,Plastic breaks.,"These graters worked fine on zesting citrus or grating garlic cloves. But, once I used them (this one and the coarse grater) for hard cheese (Parmesan, Romano, etc.), the plastic cracked on both of them. I would suggest you get one similar to this model, but one that is made of all metal in the grater portion. Also, the handles have to be removed from these graters while washing (dishwasher or hand), because water collects inside and will not dry up unless the handles are removed and then allowed to dry completely. These graters have a couple of design flaws, which need to be addressed by the manufacturer."
4,Does exactly what it's upoosed to.,This is the 2nd I've owned. Very effective as an everyday grater on almost anything. Cleans up easily and quickly.
2,Upgrade to the Professional Version,"These Microplane graters are wonderful, but I recommend the Professional versions instead. If you use your graters a lot, the plastic edges will eventually break, so spend the extra few dollars and get the steel edged Professional versions to start with. I just replaced two graters myself because they broke."
1,Grates easily - breaks easily,"I loved this grater because it can do Parmesan so finely [get much more taste for less cheese]. However, just broke my second one of these - plastic handle cannot stand up to hard cheese for more than a few weeks. Another pain is that handle fills with water in dishwasher each time.Will now have to try professional version (metal handle).Plastic just too brittle unless you only plan to use occasionally...."
2,"Save yourself the Replacement Cost, Get the Professional Ones","Fantastic Graters, Cheap Weak plastic... you'll love them enough to buy the professional ones when these plastic frames break after about one year. The extra cost is well worth the investment now."
5,Works fantastic!,"This is the best invention ever. It works amazing!!! I have the traditional box grater which doesn't work for fine grating such as a lemon or a lime.Unlike the traditional metal box grater, this tool is sharp and does the job in a couple of strokes. Very handy in preparing any dish that requires fine zesting.I still hold onto the box grater in case I want to use it for grating large chunks of cheese or chocolate for presentation purposes, but that's all it's good for."
3,"It works great...untill it breaks. This is not an If, but a When....","I purchased one of these graters locally, and it worked great for 8-9 uses over 6 months. But as others have stated, and as someone uploaded a photo, the plastic WILL eventually give way.The edges of the metal are as sharp as the rest, I lost a bit of skin when mine went.My next one will be all metal...."
5,Beesline Nutritive Peeling Mask - Rich in Natural Fibres,Miracle skin treatment - ofcourse it has to from beesline! They smell so tasty as much and they nourish the skin. Who says surgery is needed in order to look younger! Be a believer! Try it for yourself.
2,Glad I borrowed this first!,"Not impressed at all! Lots of pics of the projects and details, but ugly designs. I only like two. Some are downright hideous."
1,Glad I bought this used...,"I can only blame myself for breaking my own rule of getting it from the library first. I judged a book by it's cover. Unfortunately the cover sweater is as good as it gets, and it's nothing special. But the other reviews were good, and it was inexpensive. There is not a single thing in here I would make or ever wear. From the inside pictures I assumed it was from the 80's, but surprisingly it was published in 2003. There was nothing new or original, and I really, really, dislike the designs. Nothing classic about them either. They look like something your old-lady grandma would make you that you'd be embarrassed to wear. Well, I am that old-lady grandma, and I would never make these for anyone I know. Unless I wanted to make them look frumpy. It's in perfect shape, though, so I guess I'll be putting it on ebay."
4,"Good, but disappointing transverse flute sound","Vester's recording is really not bad. For a reasonable price, the double CDs contain most of Mozart's major flute works. However, I was disappointed by the sound of a transverse flute. Although it correctly portrays the flutes used during Mozart's time, the modern flute simply has a superior and purer tone."
3,Good bar,"I find a couple of the preceding reviews a little silly. The plates will slide off of ANY brand new chrome bar without collars, you can look at them and know right off this is going to happen. So the very fact that these guys tried to use the bars without collars tells me something.This is a good quality bar that you would find in commercial gyms and the collars, that were missing with my order, can be had for a few dollars anywhere. Just buy OLYMPIC size collars, all Olympic size collars will fit, and you are good to go. I gave the bar 3 stars only because of the missing collars."
2,"Good quality, not as represented.","The collars are worthless but I didn't need them going into the purchase. I use spring clip collars. The bar is very well made and of good quality. About 18 lbs. However, it is not as shown. There are only the outer bends. The center ones are not there, just straight. So therefore, there are only a bend above center as depicted in the photo, but no bends below center that are closest to the center of the bar. I kept the bar anyway thinking I'd use it but it has since fallen from favor and I went back to using the other bar which was of lower quality and lighter weight (about 14 lbs.) with one side larger than the other that had to be turned down on a lathe to get the Olympic plates to slide on. But my lower quality bar has all the bends in it, which I was hoping to have replaced with this supposed higher quality bar. Too bad..."
2,Poor support,The bar itself appears of good quality. However it was mailed with 2 collars that cannot lock or clip to the bar itself. Therefore the weights will fall off the bar (possibly on to your foot) After calling customer service 3 weeks ago I was promised that I'd receive a new set of collars within 5 days. I am still waiting.
3,Picture Is Misleading,"You don't always get what you pay for (like they say). I purchased this item at a higher rate thinking that it would be exactly as advertised. Unfortunately, this bar is missing the inner bends which would provide for a more natural hand grip. It only has the outer bends. It's not worth spending the extra money - just get a cheaper model which will be the same. Construction is sturdy, feels balanced, and will work, for 3 stars. Could have saved 25 USD for the same product. Thanks for nothing Champion."
3,"Nice bar, not as displayed.","Different bar than displayed, doesn't have as many curves. Decent construction, using different collars than what it came with so can't comment on them. Would rate higher if it actually was the same as pictured."
5,Solution to collars,Received my package as promised. Curl bar is made sturdy and with quality. No problem putting thecollars on. The pins have to be carefully scewed in at an angle. may have to try a few times. be patient. Once successfully installed. don't remove! Or you'll have to be more patient...ha ha!Did a price check. Best price on Amazon.
3,Well.....,the reeds are good for beginners because they are easy to play on but when you get to higher levels of playing the instrument you will see that they have a very poor sound quality.
4,Overall a VERY good buy!,"As an owner of a Kirby, its no secret that the ""Kirby"" bags are not cheap. These bags are a fraction of the cost, and work just as well. The ""universal"" design of these bags to be used in a large number of Kirby Generations makes for only one slight annoyance, but in NO WAY a deal breaker...the notches on the intake inside the bag chamber, within the different Kirby Generations, are in different places. The unique structure of the removable carboard notches to fit the different Kirbys is great in theory, but they are not as easy to manuver. My G-6 fits the bags and I use them, but when initially putting a new bag on, it can be a bit harder to push it over the intake that some may like, but again, not a deal breaker for me. I will continue to buy these in the future and recommend them to my Kirby owning friends."
5,One of the Best Albums Ever,"Without question Randy Newman's seminal work ""Guilty: 30 Years of Randy Newman"" is a ""must have"" for anyone who appreciates his music, and especially someone who likes to understand the lyrics to a well written tune. I was pleased with the way Randy organized the tunes and his comments showcase his unique sense of humor.Anyone who writes a song about turning Australia into an amusement park for Americans will always receive my full respect and attention.Dave Gubanc"
5,Eclectic collection from an eclectic composer,"Randy Newman is one of the most versatile composers of all time, able to write witty parodies (Short People; I Love L.A.); touching ballads (When She Loved Me); award-winning theatrical scores (Ragtime, Toy Story, etc.) and a lot of great stuff that just doesn't pigeonhole very easily.A lot, but not all, of it is here in this compilation; and given the fact that this is four packed-to-capicity CDs, it's remarkable that so much of what was left out is also great (Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Pleasantville, etc.).For those of us who really love Newman's music this compilation is a must-have. The third disc is filled with demos and unreleased songs that are not available elsewhere. The other three discs are more than just a ""greatest hits"", they are a sort of a musical biography -- a chance to see how Newman has changed and grown as a composer and performer over the years."
2,Don't waste your money,I ordered this shirt for my husband who is a tried and true Bengals fan. The product arrived with license tags unattached and floating in the package and I was unsure of whether it had been previously worn or not. The patch on the shirt looked as if someone had sewn it on themselves (think cheesy high school letterman jacket). The shirt is very thin and the patch is very bulky and makes the shirt uncomfortable. I will be returning this item:(
5,2 year old loves it!,"Melissa and Doug always put out quality items. This is no exception. My two year old loves to ""cut"" the fruit and them put them back together. It keeps him occupied for a good 30 minutes. I can't say that about any other toy we own!"
4,Disappointed but still a good toy,"I bought this toy for my friend's daughter's 6th birthday. She loved it! I really like the fact that she could cut the fruit instead of those plastic fruit pieces you can by at the store. Also, like the crate it came in which was very sturdy and worked as a great cutting board for her fruit. I was disappointed because I thought these were magnetic not velcro and maybe I should of read the reviews before I bought the set. The velcro worked however, like other reviewers the pieces didn't fit together as good as I would of liked. They are great for cutting but for pretend playing and pretending its a whole piece of fruit would be rather difficult for it to stay together. I think the toy was great, she loved it which is what mattered but for the price, I guess I expected a little more."
3,"Great toy, but not made well.","The first one we received had mold growing inside the plastic cover and all over the wooden fruit crate. The fruit halves weren't the same size and the glue was coming up from underneath the velcro in each piece. The paint was chipped in many pieces and they were paint dusty from the warehouse. I would've expected more from Melissa and Doug products.Amazon was great about exchanging it for another, which looked better, but the quality was not great.My daughter, however, loves this toy and it is very educational. Besides motor skills, they also engage in pretend play and mathematics. We count the halves and quarters, talk about how many pieces in each. We use creativity to combine different fruits and make up names for those new combinations.Overall, I would recommend this type of toy, but you may want to check other manufacturers to see if their product is better made."
5,Keeps my kid busy.,"I use this as a special toy only used when I'm trying to get dinner on the table. My 15 month old isn't a pro with cutting the pieces yet, but it does keep him busy and he feels like he is helping mommy cook dinner. Which he really is!"
4,Fun with fruit!,"We bought this toy for our two year old daughter for her birthday. It took a little coaching from us for her to figure out which side of the ""knife"" to use, but once she did this it became a really fun toy for her. She loves sticking the fruits back together almost more than she likes cutting them up, I think. She hands off the melon and the banana to us, but all the other ""two piece"" fruits she is thrilled to put back together. Sometimes she sticks two different halves together and comes running to show us her funny joke. It's been great fun, and the velcro bits have held up very well so far. We think this is a great toy, and is probably going to be fun for years to come."
3,Not the best Melissa and Doug wooden food set but not bad,This product is made well but it is not for a kid under 3 maybe even older. The way to attach the pieces together is hard for a child younger. I bought it for my 18 month old and she really doesn't play with it.
5,Fun to play,"I brought this as a present for my niece and we both love playing with it. It feels very real when u ""cut"" and she can get ""really busy cooking for mommy and daddy"""
2,Not as good as Melissa & Doug Cutting Food Box!,"I was so excited to see this Wooden Cutting Fruit Crate because my older daughter and niece have the old Cutting Food Box but since we are gluten free the fruit seemed like a nice addition for the little kids. Unfortunately it is not nearly the same quality. The pieces don't seem to fit together as snuggly and the velcro isn't as strong so it is more as if the fruit falls apart instead of the cutting sensation the first set has. Also the wooden food itself doesn't feel as substantial/heavy and it doesn't come in a box with a lid like the older set. I don't know if the quality of the Cutting food box has gone down as well or if it is just this set, but I am pretty disappointed."
4,Fun Fruit!,"My Granddaughter loves her fun fruit. Both my granddaughter and daughter were happy with Melissa & Doug Sets for Christmas! Amazon Prime, you kept my shopping hassle-free again!"
4,What you'd expect from Melissa & Doug,"Sturdy and well made. Our son really likes this. The velcro is already showing signs of breaking down after only a couple weeks, but otherwise it's a nice toy."
4,creative idea,"My 18 month old wants to help in the kitchen all the time, this is a great way for her to help!! When she first picked up the wooden knife she said ""no no!!"" Hows that for realistic!"
5,Excellent!,"Just picked this set up for my son today, because we love Melissa and Doug SO much in our house, we're adding pieces to our toy collection as fast as we can! It is so durable and since we love the cutting food box, as well as the condiment pieces, this was a perfect addition to what we have. He is only 1, but really enjoys sticking the pieces together and trying to ""cut""...I love that the knife and fruit are allowing him to start using his fine motor skills even at such an early age."
5,Wooden Cutting Food,"This is a great product. Both my 2 & 4 year old love playing with this toy. The fruit is high quality & has stood up to many hours of play. The only problem is that if you have 2 kiddos, you're going to need two sets."
5,Great for 2.5+,"This toy, like many of the Melissa and Doug, is durable and inspires imaginative play. My daughter absolutely loves cutting the food 'just like mommy'. It is a little difficult for her to get some of the fruit started, but is just enough challenge at 2.5 y.o."
5,2.5 yrs old LOVES cutting fruit,"This is a wonderful toy, especially when Mom and Dad are busy prepping food for dinner. We put this toy on a large cutting board on the floor of the kitchen and our little guy goes to town. He will continue to cut fruit as long as someone else helps put the fruit back together (this can go on for 30 mins or more!) He also loves the other cutting food set from M&D. It's true that some of the pieces don't hang together as well as they did when they were brand new, but after 1 yr of cutting, the velcro is doing its job. This is one of the few toys my son plays with EVERY SINGLE DAY!"
5,Another Outstanding Melissa & Doug product!!,"Bought this for my 2 year old daughter and she loves it. Helps her learn her fruits, practice motor skills and best of all keeps her busy while I make dinner. Great quality and very durable."
5,Great toy!,"I love the Melissa and Doug brand. I love that they are made of wood and are so durable. Plus, they are painted so cute and look so nice. My daughter loves cutting her vegetables!"
1,I am DONE with Melissa & Doug!,"Everything I have from M&D is sub-par quality. Things break, paint chips really bad, and the stuff is not durable. Cheaply made in China. I always though it was a great brand, but now that I have a child and see it day in day out, I am disappointed. Plan Toys makes FAR better more durable stuff, and has far less safety issues with heavy metals than M&D."
5,A nice addition,to my great niece's play kitchen. She loves to cook for you and what is healthier than play fruit? Also a good way to teach healthy habits for the future. Amazon Prime shipping is such a worthwhile feature. I can't believe how much money it has saved me over all.
4,Daughter loves it,"My 20 month old loves to cook and this wood toy allows her to play kitchen. I would recommend it to any one with a child that likes to ""help"" in the kitchen. I prepare dinner and she sits on the floor and chops the fruit. The decorative wood crate is not useful for storage as my daughter likes to take the fruit out and chop. The parts are higher than the crate so you can't stack other toys on top. Not a big deal but I wish I had know before I purchase the item."
2,"Great fun, very poor durability.",My daughter is 22 months and loved this toy. The first night she got it she and my son (10) spent half an hour making a fruit salad together. My daughter quickly mastered cutting the fruit and sticking it back together. I was very pleased with this toy for about 3 weeks then I started noticing chips in the paint. Now a couple weeks later the paint is chipping off of almost all of the fruit pieces and I don't feel that it is safe to play with any longer. After reading other reviews I have seen that this is not an uncommen problem. I Wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.
5,Melissa & Doug's cutting fruit set,"Kids received this at Christmas (ages 2, 4, 7, 9) and we had to redirect them several times to finish unwrapping their other gifts!! They LOVED it! There is enough fruit so everyone can practice ""cutting"" also. Pieces are big and chunky - so no choking hazards. Fruit is easy to place together with the velcro tabs and easy to cut apart with the wooden knife. Totally worth the purchase! I'm a big fan of wooden toys rather than plastic & the kids are drawn to the texture as well. Bright colors, accurate fruit shapes - teaches so many things, from fractions to shape & organizational placement (cantalope and banana)."
5,This is so cute!,This is so stinkin' cute. The fruit is stuck together by velcro so it does take some cutting style effort with the wooden knife to get them apart. My daughter is not yet two and she thinks it's great.
1,Poor quality,"The vegetables do not stick together. I could have purchased plastic ones for far less, but wanted to go with the more durable wood. Massively under impressed."
2,Dissapointing,I love Melissa & Doug products so when we bought our boys a play kitchen for christmas I jumped all over this. Their products are always great quality so I was dissapointed when this was not. My kids love cutting the fruit and the crunching sound it makes but after just a few days the velcro got very weak and now it is barely holding the pieces together. We also have the stir fry set and the velcro on that one is much better so I dont know why this set is so bad.
5,Simply the greatest,"With FSOL being my favorite band, i've been trying to find a majority of their albums. I was down in flordia, and to my surprise i saw this album. Listened to it once, and i was swept away by the genious behind it. The only dissapointment is the length of this album."
3,DVD I Remember Nelson,"I had excepted more of a story line rather than a straight documentary. I think it would be difficult to keep students' attention in such an ""informative only"" format."
1,Not What I Expected,"I got this DVD expecting a film depicting Nelson the war hero depicted by those closest to him. What I got was a film showing how Nelson was a amoral adulterer who happened to be good at naval combat. The film only depicts his life after the battle of the Nile, which leaves out much of his career, and the vast majority of the film consists of his tattered home life, his sexual exploits with his mistress, or him trying to excuse his actions to the captain of his flagship. I did enjoy the combat scene they did have, as it did have an effective depiction as to what life was like on the ship for the average seaman. Over all the acting was good, but the content left much to be desired for those looking for a military history, but you like your soaps this may just be for you."
4,Good introduction to the Inductive Method,"For those who want to look at the Bible in a objective manner, this book presents the tools needed to accomplish such a task. How can one construe Biblical passages in such a way that his interpretation is not tainted with his own pre-conceived ideas? This book shows the method that makes this goal available to all. For the layman of the Bible these techniques are not vital, but they are worthy of consideration for any student of the Bible. The methods laid out in this book will help aid the student of the Bible to be able to make the best interpretation possible in the given context of a passage. This could be a tedious process for anyone but beneficial to the dedicated reader of scripture.Most of this books content is useful for all but not the entire book. That is why I gave it four stars."
1,Best if your a Sem student,Over the top. For the seroius learners or teacher only. Even mentions in the book he expects to write an easier to understand for lay people version.
4,Star Wars Chld's Obi-Wan Kerobi Costume,"I bought the Star Wars costume from Amazon for my grandson, really was good quality, he loved it! It's been 6 mths, and he's still enjoying dressing up, and playing the character."
3,Just enough,"Just enough for what you pay. Extremely thin fabric, ok materials, comfortable, looks right, my kid liked it had fun with it. Quality is ok."
4,Ok,"Book cover was definitely worn, but pages all intact. So overall ok book. I think for the price it was definitely fair."
3,Mixed review,"The book had torn pages, I was expecting something in better condition. The book was received very much on time.This was the first time that I ordered something from Amazon. Because of the condition of the book, I believe that in the future I will continue to get my USED books from a used book store.Mike Gorman"
4,Digital Places: Building Our City of Bits,"Digital Places presented an ideas of an idealistic world, where 'computers' can be integrated into human's life. The Author proposed many interesting ideas of how our society (cities) can be 'connected' with a ever-changing technology. He also comments on human evolution to be 'connect' with the 'digital' world. This will require great length of dedication and effort from both the government and the private sector. Overall, this book reflect very interesting points where our society can be 'wired' and enhance our life. In the last chapter, the author also present a very intersting and helpful '7 Actions' to lead us to the new height in the 'digital world'. Maybe?, this is the genesis of our 'Brave New World'."
5,Classic Doc Watson,"Strong performance, sounds like eastern Tennesee sometimes,A friend to many and a teacher to the world , showing us we can play clean and strong..historic and this record is a good place to start listening to Doc"
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"I bought this for my son to learn his colors, but he didn't want to watch it. It was so repetitious, it was annoying. I liked the idea of it better than the actual product."
1,Poor design and doesn't make much sense,"Whoever decided this was good for four year-olds must not be a parent of said age group. My four year-old received this as a birthday present. His adult aunt could barely figure it out. It's one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it, taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring. We have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it, even though we have the corresponding Mystic Force Power Rangers themselves. I think this toy should be perhaps 1/4 of the price listed. Simply disappointing."
3,Not the easiest toy,"My 6 year old received this toy for Christmas, but it has not been as exciting as he thought it would be. It is difficult for him to keep it together. The storage bin does not hold together, especially if you want to store something in it. He doesn't have difficulty switching from the train mode to the tower mode as some kids did, just problems keeping that storage case together and attatching it to the train. Also we didn't have the correct cycles to go with it. All in all, a bit of a disappointment, but my son still loves anything Power Rangers."
4,"Doesn't stay together well, but still fun to play with","My 4 1/2 yr old really likes this toy. The back area, the ""cargo"" hold does not stay together well, the doors fall down. If your child is easily frustrated, I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, it is fun and looks really cool."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"My son is 5yrs old and this was one of the 1st things on his christmas list. He loves Power Rangers of all kinds but when we finally opened this and I tried to put it together...I thought I was doing it wrong b/c nothing fit or stayed together!! My son still played with the dragon part that was already put together but the storage bin is useless and the rope that the Power Ranger can ""slide"" down is barely high enough that he stays off of the ground and he pretty much falls down rather than sliding down. The so called ""instructions"" were horrible and another reviewer was correct in indicating how small the pictures were. I would have never wasted my money on this if I would have read the reviews 1st (I usually do). My son played with it for about 5-10 minutes and then asked why santa would bring him something like that. In my opinion it was a huge waste of about $50 and gave santa a bad name with my son for bringing him such a piece of junk!"
3,Wherein lies the problem...,As a grandfather purchasing for a 5-year-old I cannot comment on the 'thrill & delight factor' but I do feel that for a toy with more than one mode or function NOT to come with instructions is not only poor customer support but an open door to disappointment.
1,Poor Quality Toy,I would have never bought this item if I had read the other poor reviews first. The toy is made of very cheap looking plastic and it is much smaller than it appears on the box. The pieces just do not fit like the box displays them (what appears to be a large command center where the transformer can slide down the wire is just a little over an index finger long). I wish I could take it back but my son has already broken a couple of the cheap pieces. My 4-year old was so disappointed because he could not stop talking about how this would be the first toy he would play with on Christmas Day.
1,BEWARE! This is not the Alien series with Sigourney Weaver,"This is a 5 box set conatining documentaries about UFOs. It is not the 5 video box set conatining Alien, Aliens, Aliens 3, and Alien Ressurection. That box set is available and is entitled ""The Alien Legacy"", which can be found at: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000ILE8/102-7202122-8383364"
1,Don't be fooled!,"This is NOT (I repeat, THIS IS NOT) the 5-disc series of the popular Ridley Scott series based on the movies starring Sigourney Weaver. Don't be fooled by the reviews and details above. I was. I should have known better that they would sell all these movies for this low of a price. This might be good if you are into UFO/Unsolved Mysteries sort of thing. I can't say - I didn't watch them."
1,Not Windows XP compatible?!?,I got this game a few days ago and still have not been able to play it. I've been to the YDKJ web page and have read several posts there from people who are having the same problems I'm having. I've contacted Sierra and have yet to hear back from them.How could is this game???? I wish I could tell you one way or another!!!!:o(
3,A GOOD ol' game of You Dont Know Jack,"This edition of ""You Don't Know JAck"" is very different from the other installments. In my opinion the 5th Dementia is no - way as much fun as the 4th volume (The Ride). The one very cool feature of this game is that it allows you to play online. Good luck though finding people, becuase its not everyday someone plays this game anymore. I suggest that this game is worth your [money] and I'm sure you'll love the hilarious humor used throughout the game."
1,Sucks x 2,Again people should not be able to sell out of date games that can not be run by today's systems.
1,Someone Doesn't Know Jack...think it's Sierra,"Sierra offers little if any help on fixing the compatibility issue for YDKJ5 and Windows XP. In fact their solution has nothing to do with the issue. htt.....If you want a good laugh, compare their solution to the one Microsoft provides. You don't need a keen eye to notice that one of the tech support people cut and paste from their website, of course leaving out the key phrase ""This behavior is by design."" Beware XP users!"
3,SO-SO,This game is so-so. Their is one new game called Bug-Out. It's funnest one that's in this game. And you even get real photo's of who you are(I had to be an old man).
5,Fabulous,"I needed a quick solution to keep bugs out but still let the air and everyone else in and out. This is a great inexpensive solution. I set it up in literally five minutes. It's a tension rod that just slips into your door frame and then you peel of the backing to stick the velcro on the bottom of the door and that's it. No more flies in the house, but my three kids and the dog can get out very easily. I'm buying another one for my home office door and my neighbour as well."
5,Sweet Screen,"As far as I can tell, this is one of the few screens that:a) pops up in about 30 seconds (by hanging from a bar that you suspend in your door frame - think chin-up bar here, although you can't really do chin-ups from it),b) pops down and rolls up into a wrapping-paper sized tube equally easily, andc) actually keeps the bugs out.It's study, flexible, durable - this is our second - the first made it about 3 years before the fabric stared to break down from sunlight, wind, etc.If you want a bug screen that's not actually a door (in which case you should, um, get a screen door), this is definitely the screen for you. Buy with confidence."
4,Great Product!,"I live in the city and have my own front door. There is no screen and I like to get some fresh air. With the screen, I can have the door open and still have privacy as the screen is black! Great product!"
2,Doesn't keep all the bugs out,"This product is a good idea, but the magnets that close the screen do not pull it tight enough throughout the length of the screen to ensure bugs are kept out. The same could be said about the bottom of the screen."
2,Disappointing Book from a Field of Bad Books,"The author makes a descent stab at trying to explain a difficult topic. I wish I could say he succeeded. There is little to no correlation to discrete examples (that is a step by step process flow to explain the derivations). The ""with applications to Signal Processing"" claim of the title is misleading, since many times the author just mentions them in passing. I have yet to find a good book on this subject,,,,,,"
1,not good.,"i did not like this book. not well organized, missing details here and there, and typos. all these make it hard to follow."
3,KooKo,"I am a grad student who has to read this book every week to do the homework :P. Personally I do not reccommend the book for anyone who doesn't have strong random process background. For average student like me, I found myself read it more than 10 times in some of the topics to get the idea of the section (in order to finish end of chapter's questions). Also, I feel like there are some missing link that the author left out (may be because author assume that you know the background quite well) and that sometimes make the flow of the explanation not smooth.(for me)"
3,"Well written but lacks editing, a bit sloppy","This book is well written, and is especially interesting for electrical engineers because it uses examples from their field almost from the start. However, it is rife with typos, which can be frustrating in a math book, where you often assume its true, then try to figure out why. Also, it exhibits the sloppy math style common to engineers, especially when it comes to the distinction between constants and variables. This can lead to alot confusion at first."
5,Price gouging,"This product is no longer manufactured. Because of this, the price has jumped at least $10 because it is now very hard to find, if you can find it at all. It's something I have been using for years, but there are other products with similar results available. In this economy, I refuse to be price gouged."
2,Does not work like the original Crude Clay,"My hair is the typical strong, thick, heavy Asian hair that doesn't respond well to a lot of hair products. The original Crude Clay worked like a charm.Although some people seem to say that Craft Clay is the same as Crude Clay, I'm not finding this true at all. Craft Clay's smell is different, the texture is softer, and when applied, it definitely doesn't style and hold my hair like Crude Clay did. Everything goes very soft very quickly.Disappointing, I'm afraid to say."
4,Good Stuff,"Works really well to thicken, add texture and style hair. It doesn't feel sticky afterward, a plus for your significant other, and you only need a very small amount so it lasts a long time."
1,Not the same as the ol' stuff,"As expressed by many others, this new craft clay does not have the same hold as the old crude clay. For those with straight, fine hair that lacks body, look for something else. I was devoted to Crude Clay for the past 10 years. I am very disappointed now."
5,a favorite book,"First read this book at the library, it became a must have immediately. Well told story, keeps you looking forward to what comes next. Story of a young girl, spans a couple of decades, tells of her life, and has a good love story in it as well as adventure"
5,How do you say this guy's name????,"This story begins so simply with a first date and then avalanches into blistering prose and one of the most insane novels ever written. It's a strange combination (overload) of anthropology, perversion, voyuerism, and the struggle for self-discovery. The main character, Kaspar, careens through four basic drug-laced and intertwined plot lines including the blackmail of an English professor that paid his way through school by starring in [adult] films.Szatkowski writes with an amazing amount of energy and speed, bringing the reader into the craziness of his strange everyday adventures and the see-saw emotions of a character in desperate search of himself. This author with the wierd name that I can't say or spell to save my soul hasn't hit it big yet, but he will. It's just a matter of time."
5,Opera Collectable,"A must for opera fans, a real collectable one! The Video released from Metropolitan Opera presenting its centennial gala into 2 parts: part I includes the opera stars like Marton, Te kanawa, Freni, Kraus, Domingo, Von Stade and Battle with their excellent performances. More stars have been the focus on stage in part II, like Price, Nilsson, Horne, Pavarotti, Cotrubas and Caballe. The bonus of the gala was the special apperances of many operatic legendary singers, like Milanov, Rise, Steber,etc. Just to make it a one-time memorable experience to feel the unique charisma and passion of the Met both in its glorious history and live performance."
3,"Good, but I've seen better","This tape features some of the greatest names in opera, from Price, to Nilsson. Personally, I did not enjoy this tape as much as I thought I would because most of the singers were already past thier prime. Pavarotti's and Price's heads almost exploded by the end of thier duet from Verdi's ""Un Ballo en Maschera."" You can hear audible ditereoration in Sutherland's middle register, and the first aria by Eva Marton, ""In questa reggia,"" from Puccini's Turandot, was not given it's justice. To add to the list of mistakes, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa made a visible mistake singing ""Dove sono."" What I enjoyed about this tape was seeing the singers past, present and future all on the same stage at the end of the video, which was very heart-warming. To reminise on the good-old-days, this would be the perfect video, but if you want to hear the aria's sang the way they should be, find older recordings of your favorite artis or purchase something from someone recent."
4,Awesome book series,"This is an awesome book series! I love Doll Hospital! I want to know more about Rose, though. Doll Hospital books are educational and fun to read at the same time! Joan Holub is a very talented writer.from,Yatika C."
2,not as good as it's big brother,"I'd been using my brother in law's grex pinner for a big moulding job and it worked amazing. He has the one that uses up to 2"" pins. I decided that I could use the more affordable one and got the 635, using up to 1 3/8. Now it seems that 1 out of 20 of the pins does not go in far enough. I oiled it and continued the job with the same problem. My advice is to pay more up front as it will pay off in the end."
5,excellent pinner,"I am simply amazed by this pinner. I have used many others with less features and the Grex p635 is a hands down winner. Few manufacturers offer a 23ga pinner as versatile as the P635 with the capability to shoot 3/8 to 1 3/8 pins and self adjusting to boot. No splitting of crown or delicate hardwood mouldings even within 1/8"" of an end mitre. I have pretty much retired my 18ga brad nailer for high end trim in leu of the Grex P635. I am impressed with the holding power of the 23 ga pins in hardwood crown on cabinet installs. As a professional wood worker I highly recommend this pinner."
4,Best Pin Nailer I've Used,This is a great pin nailer. I've tried other ones and this is hands down the best I've tried. Keep it clean and it will be trouble free. Like all pin nailers it can jamb but this is because of the pins not the nailer. The only draw back is the case which should really have a place to store pins.
5,The 4 books put together were awsome,"This book really put you on the front line against the war with hellish aliens. These books are a must read if you liked the video game doom. The first book ""Knee Deep in the Dead"" gives you a better insight into what is going on with the characters. These books are a must read."
5,it ended a great series!,Endgame ended a fantastic series of books.the only problem was that the ending was weird.I REALLY hope that the authors write more DOOM books
1,"Dude, Where's My Ending?","Now don't get me wrong, I LOVED the first two pieces of this story, the third was kind of weak but I still proverbially ""bought"" the storyline. However this last chapter in the saga has left me reeling! The glaring plot holes alone were enough to drive me halfway insane (I can't stress this plot hole issue enough). The tired dialogue and increasing lack of explaination or descriptions became a nuisance, leaving the reader with a sense of hurry up and wait. The storyline itself went further into the tangent that took it from merely fantastic deep into the realm of absurd. I really couldn't wait to finish this series but now, after putting down this last chapter in the series, I feel I have been cheated out of a good ending to the fantastic and compelling story of some of my favorite literary heros!"
2,Booooooring,After loving all DOOM games I was extremly dissapointed at this book. The plot was ok but it only had about 5 pages of action. I dont recoomend this book. I am 14 and I noticed no kids reviewed this well here was one.
2,Convulsing and Confusing,"Am I still reading about Doom?It would have been better if Dafydd stopped at around book 2 or 3. At this point it seems he's running on fumes. Taking away the Doom story altogether, this book is pretty bad Sci-Fi writing on it's own."
2,Could have been better...,This book has been an almost complete failure of the once popular game.Fly taggart the hero and his female sidekick Arlene Sanders are the main characters through the series.The whole story was mixed up and a warped version of the series. But it did have action in some parts so if you a die hard fan of the game give it a try... otherwise Get Resident Evil series don't even make Eye contact with DOOM.
2,Disappointing,"Don't get me wrong, the book wasn't the worst I have ever read, but it did not follow the plot line. I mean, get serious! DOOM isn't about finding new worlds! It's abotu shooting things. The first and second books kept to the plot, then the third and fourth acted like they had a high and mighty purpose in life. If you want to read a book about discovery, read Star Trek. If you want to read about a bunch of aliens and zombies getting fragged, read DOOM. Or, at least the first two books."
5,"Jeez, I wish they'd do this in the Quake 3 Engine","I know this isn't a gaming forum. but having played Doom I\II and Final Doom completely through, I LOVED all four books. Even though they didn't follow the game's storyline, they were still great. After putting down Endgame from reading the series for the umpteenth time, I found myself longing for them to make the third and fourth books into a game... This book is a must have for anyone who has ever played or even thought of playing the game!"
5,A new classic in the space opera genra.,"This book, along with the first 3 are an extremely detailed set of books that add a new edge to the game, infact they inspired me to dig out my copy of Doom and play it again. I recomend anyone who enjoyed the game to read this book. And as for the twist ending, I think it just went along with the series, although I would have liked to know what happened."
4,Ending is confusing.. but i have an idea.,The books are great if you love DOOM.the ending is confusing.. but you gotta use some imagination.the bad guys arent there at the end cause the DOUBLE arlene and fly stopped the badies in their linage of the story.
5,I`ll See You In My Dreams,Wonderful tune. Is there an album of martin`s that contains Goodnight Sweetheart?
2,"For a French film, this one disappoints","I have an extremely high regard for French cinema in general, but ""Lucie Aubrac"" reminds me of formula War Weepies made in the U.S.; nothing special about it. Guess I've been spoiled by superb films like ""Ridicule"" or ""Mr. Hire,"" but I expect far more from a French film than ""Lucie Aubrac"" delivers. I wish I didn't have to say so, but ""Lucie Aubrac"" almost looks ""made for TV"" and reminds me of yet another example of extraordinary actors trapped in an all-too-ordinary movie with an uninspired screenplay that tells the story in a workmanlike fashion. It's not a ""bad"" film. It's not a good one, either. Lucie Aubrac's story deserves better."
5,An Unusual Romance,"When we think romance in film...we think of the classics (Greta Garbo, Vivian Leigh, etc). This story of passion between a man and a woman is entirely different. The female heroine simply won't accept the Nazi's execution order for her husband (who was captured in a sting against the French resistance). Therefore, she takes every step imaginable to free him...and succeeds. Now that's love!"
4,Inexpensive yet descent sound,"This headset is inexpensive, so don't expect a product you will have for years to come. However it has good sound and the ear foam is denser than most low end product which makes it comfortable."
2,Broke after 4 months / use once a week,"The head phone broke (one side is dead) within 4 months , used once a week for piano class.Very disappointed. Don't buy."
4,the headphones,"these headphones are great, they work perfectly with my yamaha keyboard, plus it comes with the jack. im glad the seller sold this item with customers, i would've never found it. thanks."
5,Reasonable product,It's hard to verify the actual quality of this product without a disaster. I have always trusted APC surge protectors and UPSs.
5,Excellent as advertised!,Surge protector arrived promptly and in very good condition. Appreciate the fine service. Thank you!
4,APC Essential 6 Outlets,"Amazing product. Couldn't get better thing from APC for your electronic needs. I needed 1 to connect my pogoplug & my DSL modem to save it from the power surge. Just the right product for that. Since I won't be using other outlets, it was easy to close them with the inbuilt protectors. I guess, its a nice feature to have at home with kids. Only one drawback, it doesn't have a flat plug; which would have been really nice on this."
5,Solidly constructed,"I bought a few of these for work, and they're well made by a trustworthy brand. It makes buying cheap power strips at big box stores seem foolish. The outlet protectors are an added bonus, as they've prevented me from errantly placing paperclips, forks, and bobby pins into them. If only my kitchen was similarly equipped!"
4,The Needed Spellbook,"If JavaScript were magic, and you were an intermediate mage, this would be the book to go with. Methods, properties, attributes, etc., are neatly detailed in spellbook fashion -- including individual compatibility charts for today's major browsers. ""Inside JavaScript"" takes a comprehensive look at everything JavaScript without having the reader wade through tedious background drivel. Moreover, the text covers the DOM and CSS quite well - providing adequately documented code samples where necessary.The relative freshness of this book allows for a more complete approach to such developing technologies as XML and Microsoft's external behaviors. Other JavaScript books can't compete for the simple fact that they were, for the most part, penned well before a good deal of the major new technologies out there became a large portion of the developer's toolbox."
5,History at its finest,"This is quite simply one of the very best history books that I have ever read. It is detailed without being wordy, exceptionally well written, and paints a vivid picture of what is was like to make a living following the great herds. If you want to read one book about the buffalo hunters, this is it."
3,"Densely packed with a LOT of information, slow going, worth owning","I found pretty much everything a person could want about the history of Buffalo hunting in America in this book- except the author information quoted by others. I'm sure they're right about Mrs. Sandoz but I didn't find anything about her.Her style was to write sort of as an anonymous eyewitness of those past events that occurred decades before her birth.Some of it I've read before in other books (the Adobe Walls Indian battle is described here in great detail, just a little differently than other versions)but most of her sources listed in the bibliography you'll have a hard time finding (1890's to about 1951). Facts, figures, it's pretty much all here but very slow going."
3,LONG---LONG----AND SLOW,"I FINISHED THIS BOOK---THAT IS SAYING A LOT.THIS BOOK WAS VERY, VERY LONG AND SLOW READING.THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION ((TOO MUCH!!)) HERE.I WOULLD HAVE PREFERED IT IF THE AUTHOR LEFT OFFTHE """"HUNTERS"""" PARTS AND ONLY TALKED ABOUT THE BUFFALO."
4,"Good break from the ""drill & kill"" method of grammar instruction",Great for students who are throughly literate in their own language and have a basic grasp of the English Language and it's gramatical structure. I wouldn't recommend it for students who do not have a basic command of the English language or are illiterate in their native language. It's too difficult for them.
5,The best ever!,"I have owned at least 20 reading lamps in the past 10-15 years from very expensive to very cheap. This is the best ever!! It is so bright that I often turn it to the lower setting, I never have to fiddle with it once I have attached it to the book I am reading and in fact the design allows me to rest the light on my chest if I am reading lying down. I adore it and plan to buy several more as stocking stuffers for all the readers in my family."
1,"narrow beam, buggy connection","well this light does fold up quite small but i have several problems with it: there is no spring in the clip so it takes a bit of trial and error to determine the right number of pages to clip it to so its secure. more importantly the beam of light is rather narrow. combine this with the short arm its on and its necessary to continually adjust the light for different parts of the page. what makes this worse is that mine has a fussy electrical connection between the battery (which is in the clip) and the lights so when i adjust the light it will often go out and i have to search for the button to turn it back on. i recently replaced it with a ""spike light"" from lightwedgeSpike Light (Black)which is infinately better."
4,pretty good and long lasting and compact,"very good booklight, only thing is battery to replace is on the expensive side. Compact and light. Last quite long."
2,But the cost of the batteries,"It's a great light and focuses well but, before you buy, you'd better look at the cost of those replacement batteries!"
3,Not my favorite,"Ididn't want to give this a bad review, so I will be give it a mixed one. It has great light, covers what I need, but the one I recieved was very flimsy, was not holding it's stand up abitlity. I am not sure I am saying that right, in other words, other book lights I try, I open, use and that is that. This one keeps trying to fold back up on itself. Again, it could be just the one I was sent, the others may be fine, and the lighting itself is really good."
1,Battery hog,"I was in love with my Phorm Light Voyager CCFL Booklight which is no longer made...ARGH! So I bought this one and although it looks good and sits well, it sucks up the batteries. The light flickers just a touch but after one long night of reading, the battery is sucked to useless. Batteries aren't cheap for this and going through 2 a week is absolutely irresponsible. If they had an adapter so that I could plug it in when I am near an outlet, I'd be giving it a much higher review but since it is fairly useless and a drain on the environment to use so many batteries and to have to throw this into the landfill, I can only give it one star. I am back on the quest to find one designed like this one but can be plugged in as well as use batteries. Somewhere is another perfect booklight but this isn't it!"
5,Great Light...without disturbing others.,"I purchased this light for my wife as she likes to read in bed some nights. I had purchased other lights, but they were cumbersome and took a multitude of batteries. This light has worked great. Bright so that she can see well, but with its adjustable field of light, keeps it from waking me up at night. Haven't had to change the batteries yet, seems like they last quite awhile."
2,disappointing,I recently bought this book light as the new bedside lamps we purchased are not suitable for reading in bed. It seemed like a good idea but the light cast was low . It would cover about a page but not both requiring moving the light constantly as you were reading from page to page. On bigger than paperback size books the bottom of the page was poorly lit. It also did not have a strong clip thus making it a little wobbly on the book. I plan on returning it this weekend
4,Cute little light,"This is a very compact little light that is great for reading, lighting a computer keyboard, etc. My only complaint is that it uses the round, disk-like batteries instead of AAA, which can be re-charged."
1,Horrible videos,"These videos were the worst I have ever seen. They hardly tell you about ghosts most about history. The guests sound like they are loose a few screws. They don't show you any real scenes, they just keep showing you clips that last three seconds the most of nothing. A complete waste of money, fortunately I got it back. Don't buy this unless you are set for a real dissapoitment. I read a review of this at another web site where it was also negative but I though i would like it anyway. Boy, was i dead wrong."
5,Yes! Yes! Yes!,"If you are a Jets fan, like myself ( yes, I have asked myself why also), this is a must in your library. Whenever the Jets manage to put that knife into your heart again with some stupid mistake, just take this out and remind yourself that we are not really crazy after all. They DID win that super bowl with Joe way back then! It wasn't a big hallucination. This dvd is great. It has a lot of great stuff in it, along with Super Bowl 3 in it's entirety as well. Hours of Jets highlights (even if most of them do fit on this one dvd set....just kidding). All joking aside, I highly recommend this DVD. It is well worth the money, and would make a great gift (just not to a Patriot fan). I cant believe it actually talks about that pre season game against the Giants in 1969. I was at that game! The Jets played that game like it was a playoff. Enjoy this DVD."
4,Other NFL team histories that should be on DVD,"I understand every team should have their history on DVD but there are other teams with a more consistant history of winning that should be put on DVD. The Washington Redskins and Miami Dolphins come to my mind when I think what teams are most deserving but NFL Films has missed so far. Of course even though I am a Bucs fan no one should expect a history of the Bucs, Saints, and Lions to come out anytime soon. The Skins and Fins should be next."
4,On the money.,The item was just what I expected. The delivy. Was fats and the item was packed very good. Give them a try.
4,How Not To Provide Valid Instructions,"I just completed this kit,painted and weathered it. the kit turned out great. Just like to add some important information. This kit is made in Germany and has excellent detail,realism is top notch. Now for the down side This kit is not for beginers. There is not one word of English in the instructions. In fact there are no words of any language. It only contains pictures (A,B,C,ETC) some are grainy and it takes time to figure it out before assembly and just how the parts go together. So choose wisely my friends or you can spoil a really neat addition to your railroad."
5,A Great Resource!,"Thoroughly researched and easy-to-understand, this educational reference guide is a great resource for anyone who's interested in foreclosures -- or residential real estate, in general. I especially liked the section on cautions for potential investors. Novice-level and experienced investors will appreciate all the helpful tips and advice. This book is packed with information. Highly recommended!"
4,A fun introduction,"This book is probably as good as any other general overview of philosophical ideas. It covers epistemology, ontology, religion, freedom, ethics, political and social philosophy, and art. Donald Palmer includes some people quite a lot (Plato, Marx, Freud, Sartre) while there are many philosophers who are not mentioned at all, but considering the number of philosophers and their numerous ideas, this may not be a fair objection.What makes this book different from others is that it is very light reading. It isn't condescending, or excessively simple, but Palmer writes in a conversational manner and with a frank, sometimes humorous tone. And you see how no philosophical ideas, however convincing, are free from being challenged and scrutinized. This may not be a book you refer to time and again, but for a relaxed and entertaining introduction to different branches of philosophy, Palmer does a fine job. Tedious and confusing language is something you won't have to worry about."
4,Excellent Introduction to Philosophy,"This book is an excellent introduction to philosophy. The author makes complex philosophical problems relatively clear without sacrificing their inherent complexity, and he organizes philosophers and philosophies according to their response to various philosophical problems. His writing is fair and honest and he does not appear to have an axe to grind. The illustrations are both humorous and really helpful. It is through books like this that anyone can gain insight into the importance of philosophy and its ramifications in daily life."
2,Disappointed,"The US album is awesome but I was very disappointed in this SACD version mixed in Stereo only. Having already purchased the Remastered version there is nothing with this edition to consider it an upgrade. I had already decided to avoid stereo only SACD but I didn't study the packaging before I grabbed ""US"" along with ""Shaking The Tree"". My SACD player creats a ""virtual"" surround mix from the standard stereo edition which sounds much better then this Mutilchannel stereo mix.Pick up the ""Play"" DVD for the 5.1 Surround mixes and turn the picture off. ( or not )"
1,Don't get ripped off!!!!!!!!,"This is just a re-hash of the stereo CD, it's not ""re-mastered"" for multi-channel playback. You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album ""Dark SIde Of The Moon"" or the Eagles ""Hotel California"" or Elton John's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road""; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again. Also it is not a hybrid CD like many other artists offer - you can only play this one on a SACD player. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return."
5,YAMAHA SPEAKER YSTMS50,"I NEVER KNEW THAT SOUNDS FROM A PC COULD BE SO CLEAN, CLEAR, AND DYNAMIC. FOR THE PEOPLE CONSIDERING PURCHASING A SPEAKER SYSTEM, IT WOULD BE IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO CONSIDER THIS UNIT. FOR LESS THAN 90.00 YOU WILL GET THE BEST FOR YOUR INVESTMENT. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO DEAL WITH AMAZON.COM."
5,i love big speakers!,"These are not big speakers, but they have big sound. If you decide to get a pair, you have to listen to the song, ""I love big speakers"". This has some good bass, that will show you what the speakers can do. AWESOME speakers."
5,AMAZING!!,I just received these speakers and couldn't wait to hook them up. I had heard them at a local electronics store and they sounded great there and was wondering if they would sound as good at my home. WOW is all I can say. These speakers are incredable. I pumped the bass and NO distortion! I did get a phone call from my neighbor though asking me to turn the bass down. Even at low volume the bass is powerful and the mid-high range is clear and crisp. I highly recommend these speakers to any music lover.
5,These speakers kick A$$,"If you want speakers that sound excellent, these are the ones. The bass that comes out of these you can actually feel it through my computer desk, even when I am playing at a low volume. The highs are clear and crisp. There is no distortion even when I turn them up all the way. For $100 bucks these are the ones to get."
5,beats any 3 speaker system!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Having owned both the Altec Lansing 48s and these I feel I am knowledgeable to speak about thses speakers. I blew out the Altecs(easy to do since they have a digital volume adjustment with no readout so if your computer restarts you have no idea what they are set at until you play them). The Altecs were good speakers BUT THE YAMAHAS-LIKE MANNA FROM HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The bass is deep,tight and rich and the satelites are so clear that I am hearing stuff now on songs that I never heard with the Altecs. These Yamahas are a masterful feat of engineering-BUY THEM!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"cool product, but came with porn","the video itself was nice, but it came with a pamphlet to order more items and some of the videos were old porn. wasn't happy about that and won't be ordering from them again."
2,glis,"Not the best ebm type stuff I have ever heard, its a tad better than the other Glis release, I would suggest saving your money."
1,poop!,if i could give it zero stars i would. the music is elementary at best and the vocals are just plain awful. don't waste your cash.
1,this is not the next assemblage 23 people,ok... everyone and their DJ's been raving about how great this band is. I dropped the funds to find out and it does not live up to those expectations. Don't give up on them because they show potential. I think my biggest complaint about this CD is the vocals: there's no emotion. It's almost like gothic/ebm karaoke where someone is being repetative with the vocals and monotone. I do not suggest buying this album.
2,"Vocals make this CD not all that ""glistenable""","With new vocalists (or maybe just none) Glis would work. It's not really the music that's bad here (in fact some tracks are actually quite good), it's the grating vocals, karoake style singing really, that get on one's nerves quickly.""It's Empty in Her Eyes"" sounds like the B52s doing EBM (and not in a good way).""Nightvision"" isn't too bad as the nasaly vocals are a bit more subdued here.""Visionary"" and ""My Cruelty"" would actually be decent sounding tracks if the vocals (female this time) were simply eliminated.""Resolution"" on the Balance CD actually is a pretty good track, but after this one, I'm hesistant to shell out the cash for any more Glis stuff."
2,I can't believe I paid for this.,"I am a medical student and I thought this book would be useful but I was wrong. I have learned the hard way that you should really look into the credentials of the authors of books like this. Slightly more useful was Success Types in Medical Education which was FREE at this site: [...]. It wasn't fantastic but Success Types was much more balanced in its view of the Myers Briggs types saying that each had its advantages and disadvantages. Shain's book did not account much for the fact the lines can be fuzzy because humans are complex and a reader risks being pulled into the belief that the types they are dominant for define everything we do. All the ""advice"" I had to learn to do well in college so this didn't really reveal anything new."
4,Great little helper,This is really strong plastic and a good design. I had another that was flimsy and the handles were not as sturdy - it cracked and sent sharp plastic into my finger... I have had this one for over a year and see no signs of it becoming weak or cracking.
5,I wish I had found this sooner!!!,This is perfect to drain and really press all the moisture out of tuna. It is sturdy and easy to clean. I do wish this came in stainless steel.
5,Workday mornings just became easier.,"My husband likes to take tuna salad sandwiches for his packed lunch. Draining tuna before getting this little device was a hassle, as the lid was flimsy and would bend, allowing tuna to squirt out around the edges of the lid. Now I throw that lid away, and use this little colander to press against the tuna in the can. It's perfectly shaped for those little tuna cans, with a just enough curve on the bottom to get that tuna nice and dry, ready for mayo, relish, a dab of mustard, celery salt...anything you throw into it. Hubby says he hasn't had a soupy sandwich since I've made the switch, so we'll be hanging on to it. Great item at a good price. Wish I'd known about these do-dads years ago!"
5,sturdy and effective,"I have looked at a number of tuna press/ can colander or strainers. I chose this one as it looks to be the most sturdy for the price. The ""handles"" are very sturdy and it does the job very well. I eat tuna frequently and this has saved me the pain of the ole' ""tuna squeeze"" using the can lid. If you buy this, I can't imagine you will be disappointed."
5,Tuna without the mess,"If you eat a lot of tuna like I do, you need one of these. Still using the lid to strain the water out of your tuna can? Ever pressed so hard half your tuna spilled out? Ever sprayed yourself with smelly tuna water? This great little strainer allows you to get the tuna as dry as you want without the mess. I wish I had invented it."
2,Wrong Size,"The Strainer shown here is not actually 4 inches wide, it's 3.5 inches wide.. It doesn't fit 12 OZ tuna cans. It fits 6 OZ tuna cans. I got it in the mail today. Still is useful for the 6 OZ."
3,Highly Overpriced by Publisher for Quick Profit Seller,"Don't bother buying this book unless you 'absolutely' have to have it for a class you might be taking or for special research. I found this book to be better than most, however it is ridiculously overpriced and would best be left on the shelf to collect dust than to fork over a whole days' wages on this book."
4,Strategic Management: Concept and Cases,"This book was purchased as a text for a four unit senior Global Strategic Management class. I have found the companion web site to be very helpful. The chapter powerpoints are located there along with case and financial analysis tutorials.Graphs, tables and charts are use to help explain and summorize important topics."
1,Excellent book,"I love the case studies they are well thought out, relevant, and made me feel like I was in the know. It's a great conversation piece because it puts you ahead of the curve in the area of practical business."
4,wine lovers gifts,Not as good at opening champagne as I expected! Great looking in black nickel.Bot a few as gifts so hope they like them. Quick service from Supplier and nice individual presentation boxes.
4,Unique Hardcore,"This is a unique album. Mu-Ziq is often strangely pleasant, but this album is just r-o-u-g-h. In a good way. As the other reviewer said, he just takes these songs and tears them to bits. You'll like this if you like Mike Paradinas' (mu-ziq) harder tunes, or some of the coarser aphex twin tracks. If you like anything from Digital Hardcore Recordings, you'll probably like this.I'd give it five stars, but the album's too short."
2,Very superficial,Have not heard the other albums from this group but vs the auteurs did not strike me.
1,Do the songs on this album repeat themselves?,"All I heard throughout the entire album was the same things! How many times can one listen to somebody rapping about how they kill people and smoke weed all the time? The only decent items in the album were the beats, although they only SLIGHTLY sounded different. As for the rapping, it was not too bad. The rappers flowed nicely with the music. With better songs the album would sound OK. However, I stated before that the message in every song is the same. I would recommend that you use your money to buy a better album because the songs were written very poorly. If you prefer hearing the same type of lyrics in every song though, then this album is your best bet."
1,DO NOT buy this blade unless you need 20mm arbor,"I received this blade can be only used for 20mm arbor. I had NO USE of it. Seller did not provide enough information, it wasted my time and money."
1,Macabre,Sucked! The only reason I even bought this DVD. Is because I thought David Boreanaz was in it. And I collect all David Boreanaz movies & TV series. Only he's not in it.
3,War on Errorism,There are quite a few tracks that just never grow on you but the ones that are good are pretty damn good...
4,good cd,"There are only two songs on this CD I didn't like (""We Got Two Jealous Again's"" and ""13 Stitches""), and that's only because they were slightly boring. ""Mattersville"" and ""Anarchy Camp"" are such fun, ska songs, I really love how NoFX did them. ""Irrationality of Rationality"", ""Franco Un-American"" and ""American Errorist (I Hate Hate Haters)"" made me so happy because it's rare to find a band that completely agrees with the political views that I hold. And I have an interesting theory about ""Whoops, I OD'd"": I think that this is their last CD because of this song. NoFX never does emo-type songs, this is the first emo song they've done. Also, the last line mentions okiedogs....hmmm...so I think NoFX isn't making anymore albums."
3,War on Errorism is half a redemption,"After the release of ""Pump up the Valuum"", I was wondering if my favorite band, NOFX, had started a decline of its own. The music sounded uninspired and wrote w/o much effort.NOFX's new record, ""War on Errorism"", brought back that good ol' punk anger that is found in ""Punk in Drublic"". With the actions of presibutt Bush, Fat Mike now has somethin to complain about. He also comments on the state of the punk/music scene today. I couldn't agree more.The songs are fast, tight and original; with much better solos than the last record. Still, the album lacks inspiration, and aside from the opening track, I had a dejavu sort of feeling about it. But I still listen...I reviewed this a five before, but i think i got ahead of myself on that."
1,Getting worse with age,"I have always and still consider my self a big NOFX fan, But this album sucks in my opinion. It just doesnt sound like NOFX. NOFX has always done a great job at making catchy ass songs with out falling into the same old pop punk trap that alot of their epitaph brethren have fallen into. Im afraid thats not the case with this one. There are a one or two good songs but when compared to Liberal Animation, S&M Airlines, Heavy Petting Zoo, White Trash, etc... it's a big let down. I first thought maybe it just had to grow on me like Pump up the Valium or So Long had to, but it never did. Its just not a good album. I hope their next one is better but Im enclined to think this one is the begining of the end. If your new to NOFX and looking to hear their best stuff try one of the earlier mentioned albums and pass on this one."
2,Weakest NOFX yet,"Didn't even no the new NOFX was coming out until I saw the posters all over Downtown D.C. Talk about excited! After the latest B.R. album hit I had very high expectations.This album misses nearly all of them. Song 1 starts out good then its a slippery slope from there. I listened to it twice then went back to Cigar Speed is Relative.Will I go to the show if they come to DC? Of course. Should you buy this album. Probably, the liner notes are cool."
5,NOFX still rules,"more then a decade of music and they continute to marvel me! this cd is great and I would recommend it to anyone, weither your a punk fan, ska fan, pop fan, this cd is great."
5,um,yeah although this cd isn't as good as their older stuff i still believe its great and they're are one of the few bands not selling out on how they sound and trying to be what everybody else wants to hear
3,Starts strong but doesn't finish,"I really like the way the album starts, Seperation of church and skate, Irrationality of rationality, Franco Un-american, and Idiots are taking over all sound great, but after that, the album sorta loses it's energy. I really like how NOFX is getting more serious and taking a more political view at things, but musically it's just not their best cd. If they combined the ideas from this cd with the music from Punk in Drublic, it'd be a masterpiece"
5,not just for people against bush,okay everyone these days think thier cool because they can trash talk Bush (who i think is a great person and did an amazing job). There actually some bands that i stopped listnening to because of this. This CD i however like very much. Even though they trash Bush the whole time i still like it. I think this is definetly a CD to add to the collection even if your not anti-bush.
3,Slightly better than average.,"I'll admit that I never really gave NOFX a fair chance. They were too popular for my elitist punk tastes. But I gave this record a spin.I enjoyed tracks 1,2 and 10. They're speedy, enjoyable songs with addictive choruses. The rest, however, was nothing particularily memorable.In the end I give this a 6, because 3 of the songs here are definitely enjoyable."
5,War on Bush,"Excellent album recomended to me by a friend I loved it as soon as I saw the cover. There were only one or two songs that might come under the category of ""very good"" the others were excellent. I strongly recomend buying this CD if you havn't already. A true Punk Rock album."
1,Sigh,"Oh goody, another music album that speaks out against Bush and war. How original. Bush is such a bad guy; you have to hate an administration that captured the most brutal dictator of our generation. Bad Bush, bad. In 10 years, this album will sound even more stupid than it already is. NOFX hasn't had an original thought in a decade. Give it up."
2,Worst NOFX i've heard,"This CD started out with ""The Separation of Church and Skate."" This song was rediculously good. I was so excited. I was thinking "" I can't believe NOFX got better. The second song and third were pretty good too. It went downhill from there. Pretty crappy to be honest. I normally like NOFX's silly songs like ""clams have feelings too"" and ""liza and louise"" but ""shes nubs"" is annoying and horrible. Aside from the 1st track and a few others this CD isnt too great, don't waste your money. Get ""Punk in Drublic"" ""White Trash..."" ""The Decline"" or ""Pump up the Valuum"" instead. Weak Effort. Where's the energy?"
2,disappointing,"while there are several good songs to be found on this record, it is, for the most part, boring. the songs sound like they were all written by different people; it is lacking cohesiveness.i agree with the other fans that its great that they are voicing some political opinions, but this isn't the first time. the decline was excellently crafted and the songwriting was superb. it was twice as political as this. the half-dozen or so political songs here just take their respective issues and hit you over the head with them, crudely and unimaginatively.i am very surprised that so few reviewers have called this nofx's ""first"" foray into politics; they must not have heard the decline.it is quite ironic that there is a song called medio-core, which is about how all the mainstream music sounds boring and the same. the irony is soon killed though, when mike sings that the song itself is boring and unimaginative.my advice-don't buy it yet. borrow and listen to it a few times, and then decide."
4,Good Ol' NOFX,"Classic NOFX with a few songs about current political matters. I always respect someones right to express there opinions...though punk voter almost seems to force there opinions ""we're not telling kids who to vote for"" on kids. Reguardless, this is a really good album. I liked pump up the valuum a little better, but I'm pleased that old dudes can still crank out bitch'n tunes like they do."
4,pretty good cd,"This cd is pretty good there starting to get back to there ska roots. i was waiting for this cd when the teaser ep regaining unconciousness came out. i like this new nofx sound they have pop punk, ska, and new wave sounding music. its not ... pop punk like New found glory or nofx. the lyrics on this cd are better then ever. this cd deserves a 4 rating."
5,wow,"all i can say is wow.. ever since i heard the regaining unconciousness cd i have been waiting for this to come out, and i'm definitely not dissapointed.. definitely some of nofx's best.. nice energy, political, and its NOFX! do yourself a favor and get this.."
3,Wow sounds like all of the other albums,No complaints. But I am certain each song will remind you of their previous songs. Each time I listen to this album I end up singing a song from Punk in Drublic or Heavy Petting Zoo. Same stuff. Good stuff.
5,the nofx-war on errorism review,this is a great cd.it's chock full of punk rock and politic content about the president and the whole government.it's got songs about other great punk bands too(13 stitches and two jealous agains).it's also got some ska and i definately recommend it to you.enjoy.-sam
2,wwwhhhaaaa,"NoFX is so bad. I'm not kidding. You can tell they really like punk rock, but they are nowhere near as good as their favorite bands, like Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Youth of Today, etc. If you don't know who these bands are, then please check them out. You simply cannot be considered punk if you don't know who they are. The only reason this album gets two stars instead of one is We got 2 Jealous Agains and 13 Stitches. These two songs really reminice about the glory days of punk. Listen to we got 2... and buy all the albums mentioned. Also buy stuff by the Dead Kennedys, and Bad Brains, who for some reason were never mentioned on those songs, despite them being simply awsome. Nofx is stupid...listen to real punk!!! Black Flag, Minor Threat, Misfits, etc. thats the good stuff."
2,Getting worse not better,"Anything this band releases will make money, they have plenty of fans.Their albums have been getting worse since white trash 2 heebs.If you are thinking of listening to this band i recommend Liberal Animation, Ribbed, and S&M; Airlines. NOFX-please take your time on new material instead of releasing an album every year."
3,ok 4 a dissapointment,This cd is very polished compaired to nofx's other releaces and doesnt sound as punk as other recordings. i thaught this effort would stand out more. what is next for nofx mtv. they are changing their music like afi did to make the $$$ with their last album.
2,They've been making the same record since 1996,"9/11, Afghanistan and Iraq were great to these guys, as it seems they'd completely run out of ideas. The political shtick is simplistic, half hearted and boring and the 'funny' songs are excruciatingly 'un'-funny by this point. Time to hang up the hat, guys. Their output is top-notch from ""Ribbed"" through ""Punk in Drublic"", however. ""Political"" punk is rarely any good as the music usually takes a back seat to merchandise sales and bland rhetoric and this is no exception. Stick to their earlier stuff."
1,GIVE IT UP ALREADY!,"These guys have become the type of people that they use to make fun of (see liberal animation). I think it had something to do with them moving to the liberal wonderland of san francisco where they celebrate ""diversity"" but hate you if you're not just like them! tolerance? yeah right! once upon a time these guys use to play some great punk rock, check out RIBBED, S&M AIRLINES and LIBERAL ANIMATION instead of this mindless junk. And by the way, if BUSH lied about the war, then so did John Kerry, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Ted Kennedy, And even Saddam Hussein himself thought he had nukes, but he was duped by his own man who was later beheaded by Saddam's son."
2,yawn,"I guess their sound is still alive but they are nothing but aging punks with a 15 year old's emotional level and mentality. Like most other punk albums, this one lacks artistic integrity and an origional sound."
1,I support the message but the band is getting old..,"Look, these guys have been around since the 80's and they rocked back in the day but lately their stuff is sounding repetitive and used. I think it's about time these guys hung up the plaids and guitars because granted the more people you can bring into politics is good but really it just isn't what it used to be from them."
5,Fat Mike never fails...,"After three years of waiting for an all-new full-length studio release, NOFX fans will not be let down with this amazing new album. In their newest release, NOFX gets a little more serious, with songs like ""Separation of Church and Skate"" and ""Irrationality of Rationality"", while still keeping the fun, upbeat humor through songs like ""She's Nubs"" and ""Anarchy Camp"". Somewhat ironically, though, they mention in ""Separation of Church and Skate"" that bands should ""stop writing songs about girls and love"", yet the CD contains a song about a girl (""We Got Two Jealous Agains""), granted the song is rather humorous, being about falling in love with someone that has the same record collection as yourself. Overall, this new album, while not up to par with, say, So Long and Thanks for All The Shoes, is still definitely an album not to be missed."
4,NOFX are at WAR,"I think this is the best album from these guys, I new Nofx were there, but i never really took a liking to there old stuff. But this album appealed to me.I heard ""Franco Un-american""for the first time and i loved it straight away. nice catchy tune with some great potlical lyrics. On this cd they got a couple of wack catchy tunes like ""Shes Nubs""(classic)""Anarchy Camp"". But overall there are great punk beats specially ""the separation of chruch and skate"" ""Mattersville"" (read the lyrics there great)""13 Stitches"" , but the best song on this cd is ""re-gaining unconsciousness"".Nofx have been around for a while and i think are getting better same with lagwagon there new cd ""blaze"" is a great punk cd."
5,serious brilliance,"some people aren't very keen on this album but i love it. buy it now. buy it or the, err, IRS will take your, err, home. yeah!!"
4,great cd but uhhmmm.....,"I like NOFX and all especially the video for ""Franco Un-American"", this is the first NOFX I got but it just wasn't what I expected. I thought it was gonna be non-stop punk but it just wasn't so great. I especially hate the song ""She Nubs"". It's so annoying. But this cd still has some cool songs. I expected more from the song ""Anarchy Camp"". I love the song ""the idiots are taking over"" though. It is hilarious. The enhanced cd is awesome. It has the video for ""Franco Un-American"" and ""the idiot son of an @$$hole (note:this is a live performance)and 8 minutes of the film ""Unpresedented"". It is a over-look of how George W. Bush rigged the 2000 election. That film inspired NOFX to make this album. They hate George Bush as much as me. In addition to this cd you should buy ""Pump up the Valuum"". Well, enjoy!"
2,"No surround, no hybrid, poor quality SACD","Plays only on sacd players, does not have the 5.1 or 6.1 sound most SACDs have, and if you check around on the internet - the sound is not much better than a regular cd. Funny since 3 (aka Melt), 4 (aka Security) and So sound fine.Great material - but don't bother. Get the individual albums (except the first two which also sound poor in SACD format).I guess that is what you get if you come out with the new technology before most other people - it is imperfect at first. A for effort, though."
3,"Only 2 Channel, and no In Your Eyes!","A. How could PG release a greatest hits CD and not include his biggest hit??? 1 Answer comes to mind. Wants to make people have to buy this AND So.B. How could you release this on SACD, and not remix it for 5.1 surround???Poor.Yes, what's on it is good, and the sound is pretty good. If you can get it cheap, buy it, if not, don't waste your money."
2,Not gluten free,"Just FYI, these are not gluten free. Under the allergy warning it says that they are processed in a facility that also processes wheat. In addition, they are not returnable, so be careful. I'm now stuck with 4 20oz packages. Ebay here I come."
4,Fresh and nutritious,Sunflower seeds are very nutritious and I try to sprinkle some on practically everything. They don't alter the taste much and they add so many nutrients to your died. I only wish Bob's Red Mill would start making more practical resealable bags!
3,Organic is better,"Bob's Red Mill Natural Raw Sunflower seeds are less expensive than Sunridge Farms Organic Sunflower Seeds -- the brand I previously bought -- but I judge the freshness, wholeness, and tastiness of the seeds to be less than Sunridge. If you're cooking with the seeds or grinding them, Bob's product is fine. If you're eating the seeds out of the bag, I'd spend the extra bucks and go with Sunridge. Amazon delivered the goods on time and in good condition."
1,risking breaking your teeth,"I agree with a reviewer - these sunflower seeds are mixed with very hard bits that could break teeth, and these bits are visually hard to tell from the seeds, but your teeth will for sure tell you when they've got one. It's outright dangerous for people of any age, even if there are ""just"" a few in each bag. The seeds themselves are fresh and tasty, but not worth taking the risk. These packages should not be allowed to put on the shelf until this problem is resolved."
2,off taste,"this is the first time that I have had a less than favorable review-the sunflower kernals were not fresh,tasted rancid.I won't purchase this item again."
5,Bob's Red Mill Natural Raw Sunflower Seeds,Excellent product. I like this product alot. The seeds are raw and unsalted and also delicious. I subscribed to this product and several other Bob's Red Mill top quality products. Any extra packages can be stored in the freezer if desired to keep them very fresh. I snack on these seeds alot and they can be added to other recipes. They seem to be top quality.
4,Bob's Red Mill Natural Raw Sunflower Seeds,"I gave this product a Four Star Rating only because I had nothing to compare it too. This was the first time I had tried Sunflower Seeds. I have been eating properly: fruits, vegetables ect. for the last 30 days. A co-worker had me add Sunflower seeds to my diet. I have only lost 3 lbs, but I have lost 2 1/2 inches off my waist without exercising in the last 30 days. So for me this product is great."
1,Watch out for allergies,I was excited when I saw bob's productsv in my local super markets- 'but all the products are packaged on production lines that use nuts. Not good for those with nut allergies
2,More of a Dungeons and Dragons story then a Hyborian Adventure,"I love the concept of the Age of the Conan Hyborian Adventures, but not this book so much.The story started out strong and I like the plot, but it ended up being more of a Dungeon and Dragon story then something that should be taking place in a Robert Howard creation.A lot of writers have tried a hand at Conan, but only a few get it right. While Robert Howard's stories can be rightly accused of being somewhat formulated, there is a certain feel to them that either you get or you don't. I'm sure it's a daunting task to carry on another writer's concept and come-up with good orginal stories, but if you're going to take it on, it needs to be done right.This story just didn't fit into a Robert Howard creation.The rest of the Age of the Conan, need to be more like Legend of Kern or I think Howard fans are going to be very disappointed."
4,4 stars-A solid read,"This book is a solid read. No its not REH, its York. if you want to only read Howard's Conan then read only Howard. But if you want to read a solid action packed story set in Howards world this is a good book for you. The plot is good, and the characters have breath. There are some PG-13 clean sex scenes in it as well that are are quite nice. Its a quick and easy read and wont let you down. I give it a C+ , one thumb up."
2,Not Robert E Howard's vision of Stygia,"I came to this book with some high expectations only to be really dissapointed. The whole time I kept thinking that I was reading a Hardy Boys novel set in a ""Thieves World"" version of Stygia. When someone tries writing in the steps of another writer the bar is significantly raised. In Howard's ""Hour of the Dragon"" his single chapter in Stygia contained more atmosphere and horror then this novel could do in almost 300 pages. So bad I didn't even waste the time finishing it."
2,We don't need three of these!!!,"This book, like most sci/fi trilogies, doesn't need to be stretched over three books. It's clearly padded with words to stretch it out so consumers will have to shell out extra bucks to get to the conclusion. And what it is padded with is a boring-love-that-can-never-be tale. This is a very boring book with the Conan name tacked on to sell copies. A total waste of time. Why would anyone read this anyway, when there are so many actual Conan books other there and many of them very well done (and none of them are trilogies!). Heck, just read the Robert E. Howard stories. If you've read those, work on John Maddox Robert, Karl Edward Wagner, John C. Hocking, Lin Carter. Even Robert Jordan's Conan stories are not as bad as Anok."
3,Anok is no Conan!,"After reading the debut trilogy of this exciting Age of Conan series - which was pretty good - this one fell far shorter.I was hoping for much better in these new tales in the hyborian age - but all I got after a few chapters here was - hyboredom!It is unfortunate. I was really hoping some writers could definately spin some awesome tales in the grand tradition of Conan. The comic books of the past and present are full of good Conan writers. Why can't these modern-day writers capture the essence of the hyborian age?I think they need to go back and read the classics of Robert E. Howard, along with some of the great 70's comic book writers like the Thomas's.Let's see if the next writer, Richard K. knaak, can do better."
4,Nostalgic Seasonal Low-Key Fun,"Holiday Affair certainly does not top most folks' lists of great Christmas movies, but there is something about the sweet plot, the fantastic post-war holiday settings in New York City (including the seal fountain in Central Park), and the deft, comic performances of the leads that makes this one very enjoyable holiday classic.I especially am fond of Wendell Corey's thankless role as Janet Leigh's lawyer suitor. He brings humor and understated charm to what is surely a difficult role, and even manages to generate some audience sympathy.Harry Morgan's wide-eyed, incredulous night clerk, who hears increasingly strained (if true) explanations of the wild goings-on that brings everyone together in his courtroom on Christmas Eve, is also a treat. RIP Colonel Potter."
4,"Great Movie, Terrible Player","This is a Christmas classic that EVERYONE should see at least once. I feel obligated, however, to warn viewers about this streaming player: it is the worst I've experienced. Every time you pause (or use the slider) the stream completely stops working. Then when it does come back on, there is only sound, and you have to wait for the picture to catch up. There are no thumbnails when you slide the bar, so guessing where you are at the same time the movie won't play is infuriating. I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for streaming movies, including Hulu, YouTube (which also rents), or Netflix, which offers 30 days free to all new users. There are many other streaming providers on the internet, as well."
3,I guess I'm in the minority here,"I guess I am in the minority here, but I couldn't get into this movie. I love Christmas movies and movies from this era but this movie didn't click with me. The acting isn't bad, but the suiters for our heroine's hand didn't seem convincing and the son, Timmy, just seemed squeaky and annoying.If you want a great Christmas movie from the 40's, try Christmas in Connecticut! My whole family loves that movie!"
4,Very cute holiday movie,This was an engaging holiday movie that I hadn't seen before. Don't know how I missed it. A hidden gem - check it out!
2,Another mangling by Madacy,"Mildly entertaining, in the way that sensationalistic, unjournalistic supernatural shows usually are. But the scariest thing about this 3-disc set is the video encoding quality. As with their poor treatments of NASA and space history material, the MPEG encoding looks worse than VHS. The blockiness and artifacts makes one wonder if Madacy Entertainment has the slightest idea how to do DVD."
3,A LITTLE OVERLY DETAILED,"I liked the stories, I liked the re-enactments, but thought too much time was spent on overkilling the same ppoints that takes unjustified time for the viewer. One who's watching thinks the run-time of these discs overall is quite a bit, but when you add up all the important details and points to the stories, it isn't that much as well as each episode's intro's and enings are repeated a great deal which takes up much time. Overall though it was very interesting and educational on the whole realm of the supernatural."
2,Trivia answers are incorrect.,"I recently purchased this collection to watch for fun. Overall the stories are well presented and researched but there are some major problems. The sound quality is terrible; I find myself constantly reaching for the remote so I can hear people speaking, and then turning it back down again. This is annoying but not enough to give the low mark.I was watching disk one, and was reviewing the trivia section. The first question was about the Tower of London and how William the Conqueror had his wife Anne Boylen killed, correct or incorrect. I selected incorrect, as Anne Boylen was killed by her husband Henry VIII. Apparantly the producers of these collections know something about history that I don't know, because I was incorrect. Yikes! It makes me wonder how many other errors there are throughout these disks."
2,Can't sleep but want horror? Try this!,Well it's certainly not as good as or as bad as some of the reviews imply but save for one or two episodes it's only worthy for camp value. Haven't wathced them all yet.No really big stars in them save for Rip Torn's excellent narration but they've been good for putting me and my girlfriend in the right mood for sleep. The price is right. Close but no cigar.
1,Ghost Stories 6-DVD Set,"The acting of the stories are really pathetic!!! I cant believe they hired cheap, pathetic actors/actresses in the recreation of each episode, why cant they find someone who can act a little. If you ever compare to ""A Haunting"" Series, it is major disappointment....although some of the story lines are pretty well written. I will never buy the whole DVDs set if I knew it was suck!.."
1,Let's make up some ghost stories!,"There should be a disclaimer: For entertainment purposes only. I use to LOVE this stuff-- when I was 12. I use to watch ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and those ""Haunted Lives"" specials and watch them re-create the lies and use spooky music. Please. Some of these ""everyday people"" are so obviously trying to get on TV and have their day in the sun. Sure, these are definitely entertaining, but take them with a grain of salt."
3,"cheep case, nothing more.",the handle on my case broke within a couple of weeks so now I'm stuck with using the shoulder strap only.
4,Can't believe I found it!,"My husband has been using the same briefcase for over 10 years. While it's not falling apart, it is showing wear. I wanted to get him the exact same thing, but Land's End doesn't make it anymore. It took a couple of years to find what I was looking for, or as close as I could get. He was very happy with it ... but is still going to hang onto his old Land's End case. :)"
2,"Darn it, the shoulder strap was missing...","Came without a shoulder strap; I asked to have one sent and was told there are none left, so I had to return the briefcase. The bag I ended up with cost a lot more. It's too bad."
3,Reasonable reading,"I purchased this book for a class on Leadership, and while it might not have been a book I would have selected, it does have some interesting, real-life examples of situations while explaining some basic leadership skills."
5,Great Book,This is a great book. I highly recommend it to any CEO. It will make you stop and think how you interact with your staff and whether you are getting the answers you want to hear and need to make good decisions.
5,Leadership Lessons,Great book. First encountered Dr. Roberto from his lectures in The Great Courses series. Highly recommend this book and the course that complements it.
3,So-so musicality cute costume,"The sound is pretty bad, limited songs - lovely wings and larger than expected. Granddaughter wishes it to be her Halloween costime come October~"
5,very good for the money,very good for the money...much cheaper than auto zone works the same way..only downside is the counter weight...make sure you take it off the old one before you install the new one.
1,Anchor Motor mounts for 2000 Dodge Neon,"Purchased the upper and lower strut mounts for my Dodge Neon. Installed very easy and they seem to work fine. Less than a year later the rubber was cracked just like the old mounts I replaced. I did look at the engine mounts at the front and back, they look okay. Anchor is made in China and I would reccomend getting a better brand. The money I ""saved"" the first time is now costing me."
3,Mount missing counterweight shown in photo,"No problems with the mount itself, but it did not have the counterweight as shown in photo (larger end of mount, held on by the 2 screws). Before you pitch the old mount, be sure the new one includes this counterweight. I had to torch the weight off the old mount, and find 2 new screws to attach it to the new mount. Not a major problem, just a nuisance."
1,"Mount rub agent the transmissing, missing counter weight",I installed this in a 2005 Chrysler PT Cruser. The mount do not extend far enought and rubs agenst the transmission. The rubber is too hard and you feel vibration. The counter weight is also missing. I had to install OEM mounts.
3,Great by the pool,Worked great for about 2 years then the black rubber started to fall apart. The battery life was not the greatest after the first year of use. That being said this thing will take a beating. It used toy any out in the sun found its way in the pool a time or 2 and was dropped more times than I could count. If you don't mind replacing every couple of years than this thing is for you I just had expected more so I gave it 3 stars.
4,"Tough, durable handset","We have been using these handsets at our business for about 3 years now and they have been dropped on cement floors, soaked in water and used to answer phone calls all day long. They have certainly stood up to the durability test. The only reason that I did not give them 5 stars is the rubber around the edges has worn off on some of the handsets and the numbers and lettering on one of the keypads are no longer visible."
1,More overpriced junk from Uniden.,Mine cannot be used past 30 feet from the base. I cannot even get asignal from 15 feet on the other side of the office wall. This thingsucks. I have 8 standard Uniden receivers and they all get receptionin the same spots.
4,A Rugged Phone for a Rugged Family,I bought two of these handsets 6 months ago to go with our Uniden phone system. One is kept on the bathroom counter and sent into the shower with the kids so we can use the intercom function to remind them to get out. The other is in our garage and gets carried around while gardening and doing other dirty or wet outdoor activities. Both handsets continue to work great. They feel solid and work well.The only downside is that the speaker volume is a bit low. When I use it as a receiver for monitoring the baby's room I have to make a point of paying attention to the sounds because her shouts don't come through very loudly.
3,OK but .....,"This is a good phone in most respects, solid build, good feature set, however, this phone as well as the non-waterproof version have very poor muffled sound quality from the earpiece. If the sound quality was good, which I consider important, it would get a 5."
3,3.5 star psychobilly comp,pretty good. im a fan of tribute cds and compilations as you get to see more bands then on a normal cd. and this is a good disc to check out alot of good psychobilly bands
1,streamlight module/bulb 20XP-LED,this is a stream-light module/bulb and the bulb is not centered bringing a dark spot on the flashlight beam ... HOW DO I KNOW THAT I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE FROM AMAZON AND THE FIRST ONE WAS JUST AS BAD !!! BEWARE PEOPLE .. if its to good to be true on price then it is most likely not worth the monies !!!! I WILL NOT DO ANY MORE BUSINESS OR TRANSACTION WITH AMAZON OR ITS VENDORS ... I WILL EAT (TAKE THE FINANCIAL LOSS) OF THE PRODUCTS I BOUGHT AS A EXPERIENCE LESSON I HAD WITH AMAZON AND ITS VENDORS
1,Dangerous; not for work situations,"These boots have a high tongue, the purpose of which is to display DeWalt advertising and perhaps to imitate basketball shoes (which is what ""high performance"" may mean). Protruding from the trouser cuff, the tongue exposes the wearer to invasions, such as poison ivy; to cold air; to water; and to other dangers, such as barbed wire. (I tried cutting off the tongue off and sealing the cut with duct tape.) Further, the boot is fitted with laces that are designed for a taller boot and that are made of a cheap material, so neither do they hold a knot, not is it possible to tie the laces safely to prevent tripping. I consider the boot a complete waste of my hard-earned money. Made in China, the boot devalues the DeWalt name, which was once associated to good products."
4,historoc gathering of the great musicians from memphis area,"i give it 4stars for the historic context.this was not a planned session,just four guys having fun and displaying natural talent.this was an exciting time for pop or rock and roll music and memphis was host to it.you can feel the excitement and appreciation that each artist had for the other.oh for the golden days of rock and roll."
4,Four great stars early on show their future talent!,"While I have not seen the new broadway group, these old memories are great. The first of these two CD's is interesting, the second CD of this two CD album is absolutely great. The pounding beat of these never heard songs make this set a winner."
2,History,"I understand the significance of this. That is, having to wait until all four were dead due to contractual arrangements. However, I didn't enjoy it at all. Not something you would listen to very often,"
4,The Complete Million Dollar Session: 50th Anniversary Edition,arrived in a timely manner and met my expectations
1,Don't expect it to last,"I installed a set over my kitchen sink. I had no problems with the wiring as some others have, and the set really looked nice. I especially liked that I could run the cord down the wall to an available power outlet. Well, it worked fine for about 9 months, then the transformer died.Out of warranty, I emailed Westinghouse from their web site. I never received a reply and now I see that Westinghouse apparently no longer makes this item. No replacement transformer/switch available either. No small wonder why.So if you want something to throw up quickly to sell your house, this would certainly add some appeal to unsuspecting buyers. If you need it to last you any amount of time at all, forget it.Now I get to try to take the wiring off the kitchen wall. After reading other buyer's stories, I don't look forward to this step either."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"The major omission in the explaination is that the very stiff and curled power track, uses adheasive to attach to the ceiling. If you happen to have a textured ceiling, your out of luck. It also requires attaching to an existing light fixture power box and offers no way to power it from an wall outlet. While there are places where it will install and function, I'm guessing that there are a lot more where it won't.The overall quality is not bad, it is the basic engineering that I have problem with."
3,Track hard to unroll........,"I liked everything about this item except for the flexible track. It comes rolled up and, unless you get it perfectly flat at the beginning, it will pull away from the ceiling."
4,A good read,"At first the plot is farfetched. However, as I read on I liked the story a lot and fell in love with the characters. I felt sorry for Luke who gave up his family in order to make his ex happy, but I also felt sorry for Matt who came back after so many years and had to start all over again."
3,"More of a Vaudevillian singer, then a Dixieland singer...","I prefer the blues, and Dixieland styles of the 20's, over the Vaudevillian, however Sophie Tucker is probably the best Vaudeville singer of her era, and this CD is an okay introduction to her music. Try Ma Rainey or Ida Cox, for blues vocalists of the 20's, and try Annette Hanshaw, a jazz singing flapper heiress of the 20's. Also one of the best Dixieland singers of today performs at most Dixieland festivals is Big Mama Sue who sings and plays washboard with banjo player Fast Eddie, visit them at bigmamasue.com"
1,Poor recording,"This material was recorded in the 20's and 30's. Very dated sound with a lot of background noise. If given a second chance, I would never buy this CD."
4,a very good cd,"I bought this CD as well as the first volume, which is blue in color. This ""album"" had all the songs which were listed, while the first volume didn't. Volume one (blue)was missing their great live version of ""Bumpin' On Sunset"". ""Don't Look Away"" represents the quintessential 70's jammin' sound. Auger presents long improvisations and tightly woven rythyms and melodies, sometimes moderate and sometimes very fast. This is a purchase I've wanted for years. Finally, I would appreciate someone finding out why the first CD didn't have my favorite cruisin' song, Bumpin'?"
3,Vol. 2-Live Oblivion [IMPORT] [LIVE],This is a very good album for its time. My favorite cuts on this particular album are a rendition of Wes Montgomery's bumping at sunset and don't look away look around. The bumping at sunset is actually better then Wes' and makes excellent crusing music. If you like the 70's group Passport you will love these guys. Very funky jazz. I would have given it more than a three except I only love two of the songs on the album and simply like the others.
3,Required reading,"This was required reading for a graduate class I was taking. The directions for use were clear and it was easy to use. The criteria was very cut and dry, no room for middle ground."
1,Never Used this at All,"This book was required for a class, but I NEVER used it in all my years as a preschool teacher in developing my curriculum or classroom."
2,"Not worth the price, save your money","It does a poor job of trying to cover all WWII women's uniforms. The pictures are few pictures and they are not adequate. A better book for US women WWII uniforms - which includes all the services-is US Army uniforms of WWII, by Shelby Stanton. The chapter on women's uniforms in Shelby is a better reference, plus there are pictures and explanination of women's uniforms throughout the book. Based on the quality of this book I would not purchase other books by Osprey."
4,Contemporary and uplifting Gospel music with touches of R&B and Soul.,"The Williams Brothers have often been described as being ""The O'Jays of Gospel Music"" and that comparison is somewhat true. This 1986 release includes the huge hit ""Sweep Around"" which earned the quartet a Grammy nomination and helped make this one of the most popular contemporary Gospel albums of its time."
1,sorry i sent it back....................the person i was going to give it to already read it,anybody; seemed like a very very interesting book. as a rule my gentleman friend enjoys books like this. i thought getting it for him would be a nice x mas present as he drives long distance. he beat me to it!
4,don juan {midwestside},well this cd was ok tech n9ne appeared on the cd so did jay-y and sway&kingtech from the wake up show the best cd that don juan has out that is hella hard to find is mizery won't stop that is his best sht every so far other and celcius and the calm before the storm and the worst with tech n9ne don juan is the producer for tech n9ne well used to be until a money problem got involved but all the stuff he did with tech n9ne was all tight cuz tech 9 was involved
4,Excellent Album,"I bought this thinking it wasn't going to be any good, but all the production (done by Don Juan) proved me wrong. Don Juan is an extraordinary producer (even though he doesn't show it at times), and on his album, he let's his talent really show. Lyrics are tight and different than your average lyrics. I strongly recommend this album."
3,This is NOT a Paslode OEM battery,This a generic battery that fits the paslode. It is NOT the one that Paslode sells. It did charge up well and work fine.
5,Excellent,"The CD is excellent. There is just one problem. The review from Amazon.Com saids that he is Puerto Rican, he's not. He is actually CUBAN. That's right CUBAN. Que Viva CUBA!!!!!!"
5,Absolutely awesome!,Every single song on this CD is simply amazing. I could listen to it all day every day! Chayanne has definitely grown a lot as a singer. His gorgeously mesmerizing voice combined with fabulous dance moves and great looks make him my number one priority to see live in concert. I only hope that he doesn't cross over to English! Spanish is always better!
5,"Oh How wrong Union City, NJ is",Next time I hope that check out the facts more closely. Chayanne is NOT Cuban he is Puerto Rican!!!! The only thing you were right about is that his CD is great.
3,Good when your bored.,"If your looking for good action, cutting edge graphics, and or a surreal sound experience ... keep looking.But if your looking for an easy game to waste some time, and like the ""outdoors man"" spoof concept. Then the various ""Avenger"" games are a good place to start. Once figured out the K.I.S.S. style controls (keep it simple stupid) make for a rapid learning curve. I drop this one, or Deer 1 or 2, in when I'm bored and not in the mood to dig into a long play game.The one draw back to the ""Avenger"" games is the obvious, and generally simple patterns. Although ""Deer 2"" did a markedly better job of upping the difficulty.The only real challenge to this game is trying to beat your times and weights."
5,Watch Out Nutmeg!,"If you prefer the use of fresh nutmeg then this is the tool for you! I had been using a larger microplane and bought this just for spices. Fantastic little tool, really makes grating nutmeg so much easier."
2,Quite disappointing.,I am shocked how sloppy this recording is. The group is often out of tune and out of tempo. It's a mess. I was looking forward to a new recording of these pieces. They seem to be rushing through without the much feeling or musicality. Sometimes they are not quite together; the cello seems to be in its own world. What a disappointment!
5,Gazetteer is Big Help,Gazetteers from DeLorme are exceptional. I like the detail and ease of use. The only thing I wish they still did is to list what state parks have cabin rentals and the amenities provided. I have an old DeLorme gazetteer that provides this information.
5,Great map for planning bike rides,S Great for planning cycling adventures. Especially locating points of interest and campgrounds. The elevation contours really help to anticipate cycling conditions. Follow the thin red lines.
3,Not as good as some other States,"I expected this map to be the same style as the other Atlas and Gazetteer books we've gotten. It's newer than the Missouri map we have, but is very disappointing. Many of the smaller roads are not labeled at all. Some are labeled with numbers only, when the signs use a name instead of posting the number. I count on maps like this to navigate through rural areas, and this map was quite a disappointment. Please update and add the names to ALL of the roads!"
4,Backcountry Illinois...,"The DeLorme Atlas and Gazeteer for Illinois is like DeLorme's other mapping products: practical and useful. This edition provides 1:150,000 coverage of the entire State of Illinois, along with specialized listings of its various state parks, recreation areas, campgrounds, trails, and other possibilities for outside fun, and there are more than you might expect. The map coverage is especially useful for backcountry Illinois, away from the major urban areas. The gazetteer makes it easy to find any and every village and town. The atlas is less useful in the crowded urban around Chicago, where only the major road networks are visible at a useful level of detail.The Illinois Atlas and Gazetteer is highly recommended to those travelers planning to explore the open spaces located between Chicago and St. Louis."
5,great price!,The book is exactly what we expected- also great price and timely mailing from the seller.
4,detailed map,"I like this atlas because it gives accurate map descriptions. The back of the atlas is a reference index that tells you what page to turn to for quick look. Haven't found any mistakes. One feature that's missing is a zoomed in map for the major cities. All in all, not bad."
1,Way too sad and depressing to read,"I bought this book after seeing the title, The Life and Death of Owen Hart. Instead of getting a a through, informative summary of his life, especially his wrestling years, I was disappointed to find out that a good portion of the book focuses on Martha Hart's very sad and depressing everyday life following the untimely death of her husband. After reading the book, you would think that a lot of the content could have been written days after the tragic event, judging by the overall tone and all the lashing out. (The book was actually written a few years later).Broken Harts is undoubtably the saddest, most depressing book I've ever read. As a big fan of Owen and Bret, I still feel this book should have never been written, let alone published. I'd much rather read a happy story about Owen's life than hear all the depressing details surrounding his dysfunctional family and his untimely death.Do not read at any cost."
3,Pretty Lame,"I will preface this by saying that it wasn't the worst wrestling book I have read. I know this is cold but it was written with an ""Oh woe is me"" perspective. While this is entirely understandable it doesn't make for an interesting read. She strikes me as a woman who is very bitter about the wrestling business. She also makes Owen out to be a saint. Hey from what I read he was a great guy but come on."
2,A self centered book,"If you are a fan of Owen Hart like i was and thought he was a great guy just by wathching him on T.V, this book isn't really for you. The book completly shattered the idea that every wrestling fans had of him and make Owen look selfish sometime. The problem with this book is the same has it was for the Diana Hart book, she thnik that they were better than anybody else and the could do no wrong. In this book she blame a lot of what happen in their life on the hart family. She also stated that Owen didn't think that Stone Cold Steve Austin was really injured and that why Owen never said talk to Austin about it. So my thinking is that this book is actually written by somebody who still didn't grief the death of her husband and that why this book isn'T worth reading."
5,"Good read,","I liked the Broken Harts book.It was a good read on getting to know Owen Hart as an human being not as the high profile wrestler he was even though he was an great athlete but I was wanted to find out more about Owen.Owen just loved to live life.He was and down to earth guy with an charming personality and he was good to people and loved to laugh.If I recall correctly Owen said 2 days prior to his death with his wife Martha ""Ive had the best life and I just want to keep on living it"".Its just a shame what happened to Owen because it could of been completely avoided if the WWE wouldnt of pressured him into doing a stunt that he wasnt comfortable with just for tv ratings.Anyway Owen was a great person and his time here on Earth helped make the world a better place.Owen you wont be forgotten.RIP In Heaven!"
2,Broken Harts: The Extremely Boring and Repetitive Book About Martha Hart,This book should not be classified as a wrestling book. It really should be listed under bitter wives trying to make their deceased husband and his family look really bad. In this book she talks about how bad the Harts were and also talks of how Owen never got along with them. She also talks about how bad wrestling is whenever the only reason her kids can go to their private school (which she mentions about 30 times throughout the book) and live their lives is because of it.
4,Helpful resource,This book provides many helpful activities to incorporate into group counseling sessions. There is a good overview for practitioners and many reproducible forms and worksheets. Activities cover important topics. Case studies are included to apply techniques to clinical work.Other helpful books for mental health professionals working with children of divorce include:Creative Interventions for Children of DivorceThe Divorce Workbook for Children (Instant Help Homework)
3,Betrayed by ambitions to improve chart positions ?,"I would recommend this only to ""hard-core"" fans of the 74-82 period, when the band was always so near to reach a mainstream wider audience. I still can`t believe how they didn`t make it ! I remember this album(from 84) being an obvious effort to change their sound and attitude slightly towards a more obvious ""commercial"" appeal. It looks as if it was already too late, with more - yes - nice production hooks, but less songwriting inspiration. In any case, it is interesting and enjoyable enough for curious BJH lovers as this is clearly a different album from their catalog.For those of you who dont`t know the band yet too much, start in 74 with ""Everyone is Everybody Else"" or in 75 with ""Time Honoured Ghosts"" and you will agree with me that this is not just another minor band of the golden pop/rock era ..."
2,Didn't help me,"For my class, and with my teacher, this study guide was useless. I did my studying from the guide but I should have been studying my slides instead. Failed my first test and cried."
2,"Not at all in ""good condition"".","A child had written on every other page, there are scratches and drawing thru out. . The book was listed as in good condition."
4,Microbiology: An Introduction with MyMicrobiologyPlace Website (10th Edition),Book was in good condition. Edges were slightly worn. Pages slightly yellow in some areas. Overall not bad compared to what I would've paid in stores.
5,A fascinating way to write a history,"I have the good fortune to be the son of Rob Hailey, Homer's brother and boon companion for the first 20 years of his life. This book captures my uncle's life-long commitment to thought, reflection, and prayer, to teaching, preaching, and scholarship. (When I visited him a month before he died, he showed me files of current projects: research and writing of vital interest to himself and to his fellow believers.) My uncle's personal journey aside, Professor Harrell has found a fascinating way to write a history. Is history about events and ideas, or is it about individuals? Harrell gives us both. This book, regardless of its subject, models a method of inquiry that other writers of history should think about imitating."
4,I had fun with this!,"I really enjoyed watching the tamagotchi grow and taking care of it. The characters are really cute, and you never know who you'll get so there's always a matter of suspense. It was cool that you could go on the internet and play games with it there. My only complaints are that it's very demanding, and the only way to stop playing with it is to pause it, which messes up the time. I have to reset the clock an awful lot. Also, the pretty ice cream design is cute, but it chips off very easily. My design is wearing off in quite a few places."
1,I want one please,i would not know cause the mean toyrus man said they would be there and they were not. i want one really bad so can u guys make them more there.Please and thank u
1,Do NOT buy this thing,I recieved this thing last week fro my b-day. It is so not fun.The games are dumb and boring. It sorta teaches you how to care for a pet. But not really. And the first one I recieved broke the second day I had it. Then we went to exchange it and the second one broke right away! So again my mother took me to the store and we exchanged it. No this third one is broken and it is at the back of my closet. If I could I would give it a zero overall. Dont pay any attention to all the posotive reviews. Dont even look at these trashy things. Forget they were ever invented.
1,It stinks horable,This stinks they copy Bandai and Bandai will even sue i heard and the guy who invented V3 you stink
3,Not essential but pretty good nonetheless,"If you sift through the filler you'll find a few great songs that are worth a look (such as the addictive 'Club Foot' and 'Reason is Treason') but, overall, the album is nothing special. A lot of the time I found myself really wanting to like what I was hearing (such as with the pretentious chorus of 'LSF') but even after multiple listens wasn't grabbed. The latter half of the album is fairly mediocre. Still, the album does have some redeemable qualities. If you give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised.3.5 stars"
3,"great album, hindered by copy protection","love the album, hate the copy protection. cant even play the last 3 songs on my diskman.if you can manage to find their contact info, call or email bmg to complain about this horrible new trend."
1,One star for a great album,I hate to rate this album that bad as the music is really great but you can't listen to it on your mp 3 player without going through all kinds of trouble getting around the copy protection. What does the record company expect ? Make people who already bought the album download the songs again for a buck each if they want to listen to them on their portables. Not me. Boycott this album !!
3,Kasabian's Debut: Not what I expected,Having heard the song 'Club Foot' on a dance radio station I decided I would get the debut album that is itself self titled. Kasabian is a new Brittish band that takes a bit of the sounds from all genres and meshes them together. It is part of a new wave of new artists who are trying to progress new genres that are infact segments of different music genres mixed together. Many say this is the continued evolution of music sound and that new genres and sub genres daily are born by inventive music minds. I did not enjoy this album that I felt did not evolve the different sounds together. Some songs like I.D sounded to hoarse and rough to listen too. Maybe towards the end 3 songs did the band get more of a feel of the music they were trying to synthesise because the songs 'Cutt Off' and 'Butcher Blues' sounded good. Not entirely a bad effort by this new band who sound like mini Oasis mixed with the Sex Pistols.
2,Forget the copy protection. This music shouldn't exist,"I don't understand how this band gets away with putting up the worst Primal Scream ripoff this side of screamadelica.The worst part is that this has been done like 10 years before with more power, more bite, more everything!These guys didn't even take a single risk. Everything is so predictable and radio friendly that you will feel sick by the third or the fourth song.Do yourself a favour and try to find something that really rocks, not this manufactured S&%"
3,Good throwaway fun,... who would have thought that when they perfected human cloning the first people they'd apply it to would be the Brand New Heavies?
4,brimming with attitude,"I bought this cd on a whim, based upon hearing 2 songs and the reviews it had received. I did not know a lot about these guys, or what the cd would amount to, but I lucked out and have myself one of my favorite cds that currently gets loads of air time.There are no truely weak tracks on the disc, but there are certain ones that are better than the rest. The prime tracks are 1, Club Foot, 2, Processed Beats, 6, Lost Souls Forever, 7, Running Battle, and 8, Test Transmission. This cd is a unique mix of rock n roll with a lot of drive and attitude, and a little mixing of dance floor. All tracks would fit in well at your favourite dance club. A good cd to turn way up while driving in the car, and roll the windows down and let everyone get a feel of the vibes.the only reason i would not give this 5 stars is I do feel some tracks are decent, but have a ""filler"" feel to them. All in all, a great debut album that leaves me anxiously awaiting their sophomore effort."
3,Kasabian - Kasabian album review,"I know this has been out for a while, but I liked the music so I bought it........until you get it home !!!When you put it in your CD drive, a message appears saying you have upgraded software, and you are requested to restart your PC. Ooops. The people in power BMG records have added protection software which restarts your computer and stops you from putting it on your PC, hence MP3 copying is really hard work, you have to fiddle with your media player settings etc till you get it saved on your PC !!It does play using the software BMG provide but that stops you from doing your own thing with the CD.I only bought the damn thing cos it would sound good on my mp3 player when training. Talk about tight.Anyway, I liked the album, not the best I've heard but certainly worth a listen,Verdict- buy it but dont agree to the software when you load it or you'll have problems- if they hadnt done that I'd have given it 4 stars."
3,"Pretty good, not great","It seems like I've heard a lot of this before. And the sounds get a little tedious within the disc itself. But it is about average overall, and given a lot of pure dreck out there, it's alright.It might help, of course, that I'm not well versed in the sources copied/inspired/stolen from, so is a bit fresher than it might otherwise be.Club Foot is good, as is Test Transmission. Most of the others have some catchy hooks will playing, but nothing very memorable afterward IMO.And since the disc is now, fair use, on my ipod, it must not be that hard to get it there. Spend 5 minutes here and elsewhere and solutions present themselves pretty quickly."
1,"Do not buy this CD, or any other that limits your rights",Do not buy this CD. We need to take a stand as consumers that we will not put up with this. You buy a CD and cannot copy the songs to your MP3 player? No thanks.
1,STUPID COPY PROTECTION,I liked this band's music so I made the mistake of buying the CD in a store - where only the copyright protected version is available. I FEEL LIKE I AM BEING PUNISHED FOR ACTUALLY BUYING THE CD. Because of compatibility issues between the software and Apple I am unable to transfer the music to iTunes (on my Windows based computer) and to my iPod without first handing over my personal information in order to get instructions on how to do this from the BMG website. I respected your copyright and bought your CD. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops too.
1,Don't Buy This CD,"I rarely review items, let along leave negative reviews, but the copy protection on this CD prevents it from working normally on many players. Very frustrating to spend $17 on music, only to not be able to play it. Obnoxiousness of this sort should not be rewarded."
4,one-track wonder but worth it,"I can't get enough of one track on this CD: Processed Beats. Great for work out, walking, driving."
5,Very very great,I recomend this for everyone who loves Rock. It's english and has some english slang. It is hard hitting and so very fun. I love it. It's a favorite CD.
3,Copy Protected Like American Version,"I've been wanting this cd for some time now but didn't want to deal with the copy protection stiff the record company was nice enough to impose. I saw that Amazon didn't label this import version as copy protected, so I thought it might be worth a try. This is NOT the case. This cd is copy protected just like the American version. I don't know if there is a direct connection, but the sound quality on this cd sounds a bit muffled as well. Kasabian should be distraught over this sleazy attempt to make money.The music on this cd isn't bad, but please don't support this ridiculous ball and chain technology the record company is pushing. They are just going to keep adding it to cds in the future if people buy them.That's my two cents."
5,Fresh Christmas Music!,"I'm admittedly a huge fan of Christmas music, and love most of it, with a few exceptions (such as ""My Favorite Things"" -- why is that even included with Christmas CDs?). I'm always on the lookout for something new, something that captures the spirit of the season with a fresh sound, and am so happy to report that I found it in this CD.Gorgeous harmonies showcase the clever arrangements as well as the songs that to me are new (""Go to the Light"", ""8 Tiny Reindeer""). I've listened to the CD many times, and find myself humming or singing the tunes when I'm not listening... to me this is a sign that this is a new holiday favorite!Whether or not you like Hawaiian music, if you're looking for something to add zest to your collection, I highly recommend this CD.Mele Kalikimaka!"
5,Hamelin + Alkan = Uncanny Alchemy,"The details of this recording have already been disucussed by true afficiandos. All you need to know is that the combination of Alkan and Hamelin (and Hyperion in this case) creates a rare synergy that has resulted in some of the finest discs of Romantic solo piano music ever recorded. The sublimity, transcendence, and crystalline qualities of the music, its playing, its interpretation, and its recording are simply stellar, almost magical. Do yourself a favor and buy it--an more. You will never regret your decision."
3,"Quiet, but color could be better","Scanning software is very easy to use and the scanner itself is pretty quiet. When trying to scan a color photograph, the color on the screen appeared more orange than the photograph itself. It is possible to reduce this using a color saturation adjustment, but it would have been nice to have some sort of tint control available. By the time the saturation is reduced to a tolerable level, the picture is B&W. For an inexpensive scanner, it's not bad.Installing the OCR software took a little while, as it caused general protection faults and would be forced closed by Windows. I e-mailed Caere's technical support and received a reply in about 24 hours to reinstall with Windows in Protected Mode. This worked fine. The software itself seemed to work well. Only a few typographical errors."
3,I don't recommend it,"I thought this would be much funnier. It wasn't very funny to me. I did enjoy seeing the young male actor, whom has grown up and is in other movies now."
2,retarded movie. purchased it for nostalgia,"okay so i bought this movie! im not a fool .. but i will say i only did cuz one time it was on a free preview back in early 1996 when we were COMPLETELY snowed in. It was the only thing on at the time and i really liked it. i was 12. i bought the dvd when i was like 26. lol oh my how it had changed. its an okay film. just dont expect too much. it reminded me of that tim allen and kirstie alley movie ""for richer or for poorer"" haha"
2,A Dollar Tree Special,"Alright, I have an issue with the cover. It says ""The Hilariously Sexy Comedy."" Hilarious is a gross overstatement, and I don't know if I could even qualify this as a comedy. It's lighthearted, so I guess I can go with that. But sexy? We have Marilyn Monroe with crooked teeth, and Havana (Patricia Arquette) bending over in the flower bed (admittedly I noticed that). Is a frock and bonnet supposed to be sexy? How about being married to a 12-year old boy? Peter and Havana rob a state fair. The couple hide out at a religious colony in Canada, eh? Peter hides the money, then promptly gets killed in a car accident. Their bible states that the ex-husband's brother (a very young Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has to propose to the widow. The kid is smart. He ultimately gets Havana to help him bring back the money. Through a series of ridiculous, only-in-the-movies coincidences, the FBI catch up with them."
5,Useful gift,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend, from her wish list. It looks like a very useful item."
5,MicroWonder,As cooking aficiado I have come to appreciate the good cooking apliances. Microplaneis on top of the list!
3,Pretty Good Zester,"I've admired the zesters that TV chefs use and this looks like theirs. It works fine, but the inside lip is sharp, so be careful scraping it out with your finger. I'm not sure if this is standard or a design flaw for this model. Does good ginger and lemon zest though."
4,Too fat!,"I found the end result very nice. No complaints there.However the handle is too fat to be comfy! I do not have small hands, but it is an awkward fit. Next time I'll buy in store, so I can get the feel of it!"
5,Great Product & Great Price,I have been looking for a Microplane zester for a few weeks in speciality food stores and was always turned off by the price. This product is the same product that I was looking at and was happy to find it on Amazon for half the price. I use this product several times a week and it is fantastic. Works great on citrus fruit and cheese. Don't throw away the plastic cover as it works great as protection when I toss it in the kitchen gadget drawer.
5,One of the best tools in the house . . .,"As a serious cook and woodworker, I have Microplanes in the kitchen and in the workshop. It is a great tool in both environments.For the cook, it is unmatched for zesting citrus and both producing fine shreds of hard cheeses.For the woodworker, it is an excellent, manageable device for smoothing and fitting--especially in softer woods such as pine, cedar and mahogany.It is a durable and attractive tool that is easy and comfortable to use in a variety of ways. There just aren't many like that!"
5,my favorite kitchen tool ever!,"This has got to be the best addition to my kitchen since I got my first food processor in the late 70's. It's the best for zest, hard cheeses, chocolate, nutmeg, and try it for ginger too. After receiving one of these, I have ordered every other size available, and it will be at the top of my list for gift giving. Don't miss out on this one!"
1,Not very sturdy!,"I loved this item, and used it almost every day to add a little cheese to most everything. Then, then handle fell off. So ... I bought another. Then, the handle fell off.Sorry, I'm not buying it again."
5,"save time, ease work","I needed to grate the zest from seventeen lemons (!!), the zest only and none of the white pulp, in order to make the Sicilian specialty liqueur limoncello. This grater worked like a dream---quickly and easily rendering the zest, enormously simplifying my task.If you have sometimes substituted lemon or orange flavoring when the recipe calls for zest, as I have done, get this grater and use the real thing.This product has become one of my favorite kitchen tools. Highly recommended."
4,Excellent Lemon Zestor,I purchased this product to save time making Lemoncello per recommendation. I was able to zest 20 lemons in about 20 minutes (1L/m) with nearly no pith (the white stuff beneath the yellow skin thats bitter). No complaints for the price.
5,"Easy to use, and it works well","I used this grater today for the first time to grate chocolate after my regular box grater wasn't ""cutting it"". This does the job. It has a very sharp blade. It does grate things super fine so hang on to your box grater (or other grater versions made by this company) for grating larger pieces. I was using it to grate chocolate for ben & jerry's cherry garcia ice-cream and this did the trick. Though I decided I wanted chocolate chunks instead of shavings, I fortunately had this so I felt like I was able to make that choice instead of not being able to b/c of my other grater. I will use this for grating parmesan cheese for cooking (another reviewer noted - use a bigger grater if you want larger pieces of cheese for garnish) and spices, and in any situation in which I want a finely grated food product. Oh, and it's lightweight, easy to hold, and really looks like a quality product."
5,High shipping charges,The zester is fine but a $10.24 shipping charge on a $15.99 item is ridiculous. The only reason I bought this item was that I had a gift certificate that had to be used. Such shipping charges are outrageous!!
3,Grater-Not for Everything,"I purchased this grater based on the raving reviews, as well as the TV Chefs usuage. I was disappointed on how it grates cheeses such as Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino-Romano. The grates on this Microplane Grater make the harder cheeses come out more mini ribbon like. This produces a very airy, light cheese. Not good for sprinkling on top of pasta dishes. I have found that a box grater is better for grating cheeses of these types when recipes call for grated cheeses. The box grater rounded tines leaves the cheese more dense in texture.It does do a nice job zesting oranges, lemons, limes and other citrus fruits .Have both in your kitchen."
5,Incredible,"Okay, after about 4 weeks this little device has changed my eating habits. It grates parm and other hard cheeses into gossamer - a shread so fine that it almost melts in your hands. Put this onto pasta and there is just so much more flavor, it just pops. Wipe it down, clean up is painless. Sounds very specialized but I promise you will use this more than you think."
5,"Wow , worth its weight in gold!",I used this recently for an orange sweet bread recipe. It works so effortlessly. I have avoided fresh Lemon and orange peel in the past because grating it was very time consuming. And sometmes you went too deep and added unwanted bitterness to your recipe. The fresh peel tastes sooooo much better and with the microplane it is really easy. I can't wait to try fresh ginger root. This opens a whole new realm of easy and tasty possibilities.
5,This is a precision tool,"Is sharper, easier to use , easier to clean and produces less waste than any grater I have ever used. Just set in a bowl and grate or zest away."
1,Does not work for me,"I purchased this item with the expectation that it could be used on medium hard (or medium soft) food products. It uses a lot of effort to end up with a mushy substance. It is completely disappointing. I just read the description and thought it would work very well with most food items I use. Hardly. It will probably only work on very, very hard food products like a rock solid cheese. I made a big mistake and would not recommend this item to anyone. I did not know that another Grater was available instead of the one I purchased. I might have been happy with that one. At least these are very inexpensive items. Live and learn."
4,Love the Microplaner!,"The Microlaner I bought is exactly the right size for most of my cooking jobs. I have used it on oranges, limes, lemons and ginger. Works great, easy to clean up after I am done."
2,SO LONG,With the curved edges and being so long it very hard to get what you zested out. Why not make it without the edges then it could be easily scraped. Very hard to clean the way it is. Not worth the work for me.
5,Highly recommend,Makes my life so much easier. Clean in dishwasher - don't try to clean yourself. I definitely recommend this product. Good investment.
5,Gets the job done!,"Very handy tool for zesting, or finely grating things like whole nutmeg, garlic, or even cheese. Easy clean-up too--just rinse and pop it in the dishwasher."
5,One of my best kitchen tools,No more grated nuckles/fingers when zesting lemons. This is so easy to use and I find it easy to clean too if you rinse it off straight away after use. It's really effective and makes zesting quick and painless. I plan on buying one for my sister-in-law too.
5,"For Zest, the Best","Zester works flawlessly. Zesting becomes a trivial task with this instrument. Because there is no substitute for zest, well worth the modest price."
4,Spice It Up!,This one stays next to me in my sushi bar! Quality Zester that does the job and should last a long long time!
5,You'll love this!,"I had basically given up on grating zest, because it's so difficult with other graters. Either you slice open your hand on the grater, or the grater ""eats"" most of the zest. This gadget is SOOO slick, it makes grating lemon, orange or lime peel a snap. Also great for finely shredded parmesan. It's also easy to clean--zest just brushes off. No more trying to dig lemon peel from between the crevic es of your box grater. I think it's so great, I gave them all of my family for Xmas presents."
4,Good product.,"I bought this product to easily zest citrus. It does the job with ease, and I would easily recommend it,"
5,The best of the best,"In all my many years of backing and cooking I have never found any utensil as good as my Microplane Grater. I use it for grating hard cheese and chocolate, it is unbeatable as a zester. To top it of ,it is easy to clean. I love it!!"
5,Awesome!!!,"There is no better zester than this, especially the zester with handle. I used it 3 times in the first week I received it from amazon.com because I love it sooooo much!!! It is very sharp, I would not recommend the one without handle. It's now my favorite kitchen gadget!"
5,Excellent products,"Not very much to say, other than that the entire line represents the very best that you can buy. Very little effort, and perfect results every time. This is a tool line that has no equal."
5,works!!,"It's the Best grater I've ever owned. Problem is it only ""grates""(?) very fine. Wish they sold it in more sizes."
4,Good zester but food gets stuck,"This is a good microplane zester. It has nice small holes. It performs a good job of finely grating or zesting your food. It does an easy job and is easy to clean. My only complaint is that some foods, moist foods in particular, kinda get clumped and stuck on the underside of the zester because of the lips of the metal curving over."
3,This is an overated Zester,I figured for the reviews and the ratings this must be he best zester out there. But if you are planning zesting for a lemoncello - do NOT buy this. If the grater was bi-directional it would be a 5 star review... I ended up using a potato peeler it was faster than using this zester.
1,Not happy,"I run a small restaurant that frequently requires me to zest lemons for recipes, my first zester was great, however, after a few months of being washed in a commercial high temp dishwasher the plastic fell to pieces, I bought this one because it looked much sturdier. I will say this, it is sturdy, but that is all this tool has going for it. Perhaps this was a mistake from the factory but it seems that all of the tiny blades were never raised above the surface of the implement therefor making zesting impossible. You can run the back of your hand over it and not even get a scratch. Safe? Yes. effective? No. I will not be buying one of these on line with out being able to feel it in my hands."
5,A must have for any kitchen,"After years of toilling with an old fashined grader for making lemon cakes, lime cookies, etc, I picked one of these up.First off, throw your old grader away and never try to zest with it again. The microplane makes the work so much easier and QUICKER! A full lemon takes just 30 seconds to zest, pecorion romano and parmigiano reggiano melt off this thing as if it were on fire!I've since bought a few others in assorted sizes."
1,works great but breaks too soon,"These are great graters but they're made of plastic and won't last. I've had three and none has lasted a yearso I won't buy them again. They crack, bend near the handle. It is a design flaw. If not for that, yes, a good product."
4,Works like a charm and easy to clean!,"This is the best grater I have ever used, and I have been through quite a few. Of course, you do have to trim the piece of cheese to work most efficiently, but it is sheer bliss to see the cheese flakes ""snow"" on your food.Clean up has been simple too, just a quick run under warm water and it is done. The slick surface prevents any residue from sticking. Of course, that applies for hard and medium cheeses like Romano and Asagio, not soft ones.I have used this grater for some time now and am as happy with it as I was the first time I used it. Another reviewer mentions that the grater dulls over time and may have to be replaced. While I think any cutter or grater will become less efficient over time, the cost is so reasonable that replacing it after a couple of years would not bother me at all. I just hope I am able to find as good a replacement!"
4,Very good job...really interesting texture.,"Wow...this makes these light, fluffy FLAKES, almost. It looks like snow, or Easter grass or something.Grates the hardest, oldest cheese with no problem and turns it into fluffy goodness. A little messy to use at the table, however."
5,Great tool,Far exceeds other zesters I have owned. It's very well made and sturdy with a good handle to grip. Would recommend
5,Best buy for under $10,"This is one of my fovorite kitchen tools. I received this as a gift for my birthday last january and i don't know how i survived without it. It's great for shredding cheese, garlic, ginger and zesting. This is the tool Rachel Ray uses on ""30 Minute Meals."" It is very handy and dishwasher safe, always a plus.One tip, watch out for you fingers, these are sharp!"
5,Amazingly useful kitchen tool,"I use my Microplane for zesting lemons and limes and grating hard cheeses, chocolate, and ginger. It does all these tasks better than any other grater I've used. If you don't have one, get it now."
5,This beats my old box grater hands down,I've been using my old box grater to zest and grade nutmeg and chocolate. This is much better and easy to clean.
5,"Watch your fingers, folks!!","This is one of the finest products for the kitchen I have ever used, and that is coming from a gourmet cook. The product is constructed of a high-quality metal, and the 'teeth' are precision ground. Rather than with a traditional zester, where you scrape off the skin of the fruit, the microplane actually shaves it off effortlessly using its razor-like edges. Can be used on anything you want to zest or grate super-fine - if you want to use the zest as a garnish (such as a lemon 'swizzle' to accent a cocktail/martini), however, a traditional zester would be rcommended. This one just absolutely powders whatever you use it on...definitely not a detractor from buying though !! I like to use it especially when serving a chocolate dessert - a fine dusting of chocolate is easy to acomplish with the microplane. Just be careful of your fingers...if you 'rub it the wrong way' it will bite!"
5,superior quality tool,"My new microplane zester is, by far, the best utensil I've ever used to zest citrus fruits. It's extremely user-friendly, and removes only the very top layer of the peel, making it simple to not dig into the pith. And it enables me to work more quickly than was possible w/my old zester. I love it!"
5,THE grater for zest,"After years of getting nasty zest, I found the microplane grater, and I love it. It works beautifully, giving fine zest that isn't mangled up and stuck to the grater's holes; and it is very easy to avoid getting the white pith underneath. I have also used it quite successfully on fresh ginger and garlic for Indian spice pastes. It cleans up quite easily and stays sharp. I have also found myself much less likely to scrape my knuckle using it than other fine graters that aren't so sharp and require more pressure to grate. I consider it a kitchen essential."
5,What A Quality Grater!,Great price on this item. Quality and convenient as well. Good addition to any kitchen - and a Great buy as well.
2,Not a Great Grater or Zester,"I bought this hoping to, as described, use it as both a zester and grater for cheese and lemons. It zests fine. But as a grater is no better than my old grocery bought grater."
5,Can't wait to use!,"Can't wait to use this item! I wished for on Amazon and received as a gift! Now I have to find something to cook to use it, shouldn't be too hard! It feels very sturdy and larger than I realized, but perfect for any use! Nice handle too!"
3,Starts off well,"This game has an exciting beginning and is wicked funny. One drawback is that I find it impossible to kill the last hunter. Overall, the game is pretty easy except for the last two hunters and I recommend getting this game only if you play games about 30 minutes a day."
2,difficult to use,"I am not too happy with this item. It has a handle, yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot. It is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out. And the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use. Other than that, it is attractive looking and constructed well."
2,waste of good wood,"I ""played"" with this at a specialty toy store and was pretty disappointed with it. I thought I wanted this for my son after seeing it online but I'm so glad we got to try it at a store first. My toddler showed almost no interest in it. It looked hard to use and not at all fun. However, it looked like it was well made of good wood and with good stains/paint and finishes.We've had more fun with a plastic food container that I cut a square shape on the lid and my son fills it up with his wooden ABC blocks. BTW, you can do the same using matchbox cars, Peek-A-Blocks, etc. Just use a different plastic food container (yogurt, sour cream, powdered drinks, etc.) for each shape."
5,Fantastic Bass!,This bass was purchased for a teenager who has high expectations when it comes to his music. The guitar was packaged well and was delivered sooner than expected. The bass is a beautiful instrument with excellent craftsmanship and a sound that is so sweet that words can't describe. Definitely something to consider if you are looking for a nice bass.
4,Easy Rice Side Dish,"Rice-A-Roni is a fairly easy-to-prepare, flavorful side dish. Where you need to be careful is cooking time. Not enough time and the rice is too hard. Too much cooking time and it turns to mush. The most consistent way I have found is to saute the rice & noodle mix in butter (or margarine) until the vermicelli turns a medium shade of brown (directions say ""golden"", but it needs more time.) Add the water and seasoning. Stir. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low to simmer for about 20 minutes. The important thing is that the liquid needs to be completely absorbed into the rice & noodles.When the liquid has been absorbed, taste the mixture. The rice may still be a bit hard and need more time. Give it a few more minutes.Do not reduce the amount of water from what the directions call for."
3,Tastes Like Raman Noodles.......,"Golden looking rice mixed with everyday spices is a popular American meal. While there is spices, and chicken health food this is not.Tasting like Raman Chicken Mix one could easily use them for both products, and be difficult to tell by taste, which is which mix.Fast making foods come as a huge guilty pleasure. Knowing there are ingredients that have been chemically changed leaves one with uneasy vibrations.Second and third thoughts come, and you begin to wish for some homemade soup. To know each item is a sense of reassurance these processed foods often leave behind.You then take a deep breath, and hope for the best outcome."
3,Poor Playback Quality,"I was really excited to receive this DVD. I was at the final game, so it was going to be really cool to watch the game again on TV, especially the last few minutes.However, I'm quite disappointed with this DVD. Although the original broadcast was in HD, the playback on the TV screen is in a smaller letterbox size, and the quality isn't close to DVD/HD quality. It looks like 480 at best. It's grainy and just not up to par.If you are buying this hoping to see the same or similar quality you would have experienced when watching it on CBS live, (in HD or not), you will be, like myself, sorely disappointed.I would not recommend this product."
2,"Perhaps the best game I've ever seen, perhaps the worst DVD I've ever seen.","I completely agree with the first review. I also went to the game and was extremely excited to watch the game on DVD. However, there is no way the DVD is output in HD. It truly ruined the whole experience; the picture was terrible and the sound wasn't much better. Once again, it seems CBS has somehow managed to take the greatest championship event in sports and reduce it to an average and frustrating viewing experience."
2,Quality Problems,"I concur with the previous reviewer. The picture quality of this DVD is exceptionally poor even when using an upscaling BR player. Faces are hard to distinguish even on a 52"" tv. Great game, but should have been released in HD."
5,Seefeel Quique - redux ed.,"I had the original a LONG time ago... has been missing and was so happy to see it reissued!!Amazing work, highly recommended of course!"
4,Seefeel - 'Quique' (Astralwerks) 4 1/2 stars,"I've been trying to snatch up a copy of this CD for awhile now.'Quique' is apparently this UK band's first release.A worthy title where dreamy electronic successfully cross-breeds with techno.Most of the nine cuts here average seven minutes in length.Total duration is 63:23.Good song structure,I thought.Great chill-out music to fully experience.No best tunes here,they're all good.But,the ones that I thought were most impressive are ""Climactic Phase #3"",""Industrious"" and ""Plainsong"".Line-up:Sarah Peacock-vocals,Mark Clifford-guitar,Darren Seymour-bass and Justin Fletcher-drums.Might appeal to fans of My Bloody Valentine,Orbital,Spacetime Continuum and Mouse On Mars."
2,vilayat khan,A late recording of Vilayat KhanI have heard him play the same rag much better. I think it may be on hmvthis one lacks the vibrance of the artist
5,J. Thompson's Romantic Night,"The only question i have is concerning the name. That said, I can tell you that this is an excellent CD. Outstanding musicians, and the singer Melisa Kary provides enough variety that makes this cd a listening pleasure. I stronghly recommend that you add this cd to your smooth jazz collection."
2,Want A Real Train Game Try Trainz!,Don't touch it. This is the most horrible excuse i've ever seen for a train game ew! This a bad game for kids to get into trains oh i love Lionel but they are not so good at games stick to the O gauge stuff. But seriously folks don't waist your money on this game. How about Trainz very good game awsome! well fell free to SEE MORE ABOUT ME Bye!
4,Works good,"I bought this nailer to install my flooring and it has worked great, it does especially well to pull any warp out of the boards to give a tight fitting joint. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is only because of the included mallet--the handle is too thin and does not have any grip to it. I had to wrap the handle with a thick layer of tape to be able to hold onto it."
3,Okay while it worked!,"This product takes some strength to use and I probably should have rented a power nailer, that being said, it did a good job while I could use it. It jammed several times and that required me stopping my work to fix the jam. At this point, with my floor half installed it has jammed to where I can't fix it, therefor, I can't finish the floor with it. It wasn't super expensive, but it did ultimately become a waste of money. Maybe someone else will have better luck than I."
3,a mistake,I purchaed this nailer to install 700 square feet of new flooring. Thinking this was a better idea than renting a nailer. When the day came for the installation I had to hire an hourly worker to install the floor because of my schedule. In the first 10 minutes the MFN200 broke. I had to go to the box store and rent a nailer afterall. I bought this nailer based on personal experience with Bostich and they did repair the nailer at no cost but now I am stuck with a nailer that has 10 minutes of use in it. And I still had to pay for the rental fees.
5,This is a great CD/DVD binder,I spent a lot of time looking for a binder to hold CDs/DVDs. It is amazing how many I found that came with sleeves and you couldn't add sleeves to it. I receive a lot of CDs from various software vendors that are already in sleeves. I didn't want to remove the CDs from sleeves and then put them into the sleeves that came with the organizer. This is great for archiving my CDs and moving them between binders easily. I highly recommend this product!
3,single realtor,"i praise any book written about real estate, as it can be a difficult process at times. However, this book is about buying a home, and really has nothing to do with being single. It doesn't really matter if one, two or three people are buying a home...the process is still the same!"
3,State Quarters Display Book,"The book itself is nice, but the holes to put the quarters in are off sized and half the quarters fall out all the time."
4,Does the job,This folder was not as difficult to place the quarters in. It also has a nice layout giving kids information about each state. I prefer this one that the folder by Whitman.
1,50 States Quarter Folder is Worthless,"Poor design; will not hold quarters. Frustrating for adults, much less for children to use."
2,Quarter Folder,"I like the lay out of the folder, but the quarter will not stay in the slots. the Slots need to be a little deeper in order for the quarters to stay in."
1,Worth a quarter,"For my other child, I have a Scholastic book that actually works. With this one, I had to tape in each quarter. You don't get much for $6, which is the lesson here."
1,50 States Quater Folder,The quarters won't stick in the place for them. They fall out.I feel that I was screwed.I will be very slow to purchase anything else from you.Don
1,disappointed,"I ordered this fully expecting it to be the FOLDER as it says. Instead all I got was the tiny book that comes INSIDE the folder, no outer cardboard folder with the plastic molded quarter holders. Now it's going to cost me more to order what I need and none of these descriptions seem to indicate what you really get."
2,quarter folder,"It was just ok, it is very hard to get the quarters in and on one I can not even get the quarter to stay in. So I would not buy any more."
2,50 States Quarter Folder,"Poor quality. The plastic where you insert the coins comes right off the cardboard. The inside leaflet that has information about the states is nice, for little kids."
1,This won't hold your quarters in place.,"This product didn't come out as expected. I saw the same product of this at Barnes and Noble that has a better design. The book that was delivered to me just can't hold the quarters in place. They would always pop out and fall. This won't hold my quarters in place. I have to put the whole thing in a ziplock bag just to make sure I don't lose anything. I got what Barnes and Noble has, and it solved the problem. Don't get this. It's a waste of money."
1,Don't buy these,"I actually bought these from somewhere else. Hardly any of the coins would stay in their spots, they just fell out immediately. The only thing worthwhile was the little booklet about the states, but you could get something like that elsewhere. I returned them all."
2,Disappointed,"When I bought this, I expected the coins to fit in the slots and not fall out. They do not do either!!! I guess I will have to glue or tape them in place so that they do not slide all over the place...Buyer Beware..."
4,Another very nice fragrance,This is a very nice smelling Lampe Berger fragrance. It makes the whole house smell sweet and pleasant. I would recommend this fragrance to anyone.
3,Haters of the purpose,Vickie winans voice is great and she makes the message fresh. to all the haters the song Superman is great as thats what christ was as as a man he didnt sin. Im a gospel singer songwriter and i wish id wrote that song
1,Disappointed!!!!!,"I am a huge fan of traditional gospel music and I am struggling to accept some of today's new contemporary gospel songs. This is quite evident in Vickie Winan new CD, ""Bring It All Together"". I am a fan of Vickie Winan but this CD was quite disappointing. Vickie should decide if she wants to sing R&B or continue to produce songs found on her album, ""Live in Detroit Volume two"". That's the music I enjoy from Vickie and at almost $16.00 for a CD, you should at least be able to find more than 1 or 2 good songs."
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE!!! INCREDIBLY HORRIBLE!!!!,"What more can I say? This is one of the very worst cd's in the history of any kind of music. I got this as a birthday gift, and quite frankly ---I'm offended."
4,Beautiful Album,"I actually liked this album. Vickie is mostly known for her traditional songs, but with 'Bringing It All Together' she aims to connect with a younger audience. This album is filled with joyful, uplifting songs for the young and young at heart. Who wants to hear an artist that follows the same formula with each album and never tries anything new?? Not me!! I applaud Vickie for trying something out of the box and making it hott and fresh!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM"
3,Lazy Guy,Okay I will admit I might not be using this for what it was intended for. I get holes in my jeans and pants all the time and I just don't feel like sewing patch on each hole. I use the fabric glue with cut up strips of fabric and plug up the holes. I still haven't been able to use the right amount of glue to attach it without it seeping through. Once you bond the fabric together it isn't going anywhere and if you put to much you can see that it looks like a wet stain. The bottle only comes with a pour spout and a little straw for detail work. I would like to see the top redesigned for more accurate pouring.
1,IZflAws,"This product DOES NOT RESTORE LEATHER it destroys it. It might be for large gaps as on leather car seats, but It doesn't get rid of cracks"
4,Leather Adhesive,This product works exactly as described. Dries quick and remains pliable not stiff like other adhesives. I highly recommend this to anyone who works with leather.
1,Piece of crap,This book is horrible. It;s about a kid who moves to america and has problems. it's so boring. I'd rather have a buffalo take a diarreah dump in my ear. I was assigned to read this piece of crap over the summer by our teacher. Piece of crap don't buy it.
4,I miss Pluto the Planet...it is nice to find it again here,As the tag says it is nice for Pluto to get some recognition. It is a nice tune and a great smphony overall.
3,Good for its use,"While one of the most casually written textbooks ive read, it does convey the necessary material in a way that is understandable and readable. Stojkovic makes the abstract ideas behind these beauracracies, but seems to be lacking information on management and leadership. Although this is mostly a lost cause anyway because leadership is for the most part nonexistent in criminal justice systems. Because of their makeup, these organizations rely on MANAGEMENT tecniques and leadership takes a backseat. Overall a good text, just a little confused."
1,Stopzilla Sucks,"It sucks. Don't waste your money. No customer support. If it doesn't work, you are out."
1,Stop Stopzilla,"I downloaded the free trial version of Stopzilla. I ran the scan, it immediately identified 3 trojans. Only problem: I had previously scanned with other software & know for a fact I did not have these trojans. In other words, it was a bogus scan. The program might work perfectly, but I'm not about to pay for something that uses devious scare tactics to hook me in."
1,buy this product if you want to kill your computer,"I bought Stopzilla on disc and put it on my desktop computer.That was fine, still running fine. I have a very new, very expensive Dell laptop. I bought an additinal license online and put it on the laptop. At first, things were fine. Then my mouse wasn't working consistently. Then I couldn't get a connection online. Then I got the black screen of death. couldn't boot the computer up, couldn't turn it off. Called Stopzilla. They couldn't have cared less. And get this! I got my credit card bill, and they charged me some $39.95 subscription fee instead of the $14.95 license. I have spent hours on the phone with AOL, Dell, and Verizon trying to get this all figured out. The laptop is still in ruins, even though the nice tech at Dell uninstalled the Stopzilla and did a full check up on the laptop. In case you haven't figured it out, I don't recommend the Stopzilla software."
1,Stopzilla sucks,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! Customer support is terrible. I finally gave up on getting it to work and just took the loss. Then I received a yearly renewal charge on my credit card. I called to have it refunded, but they were very rude and said they would not because it was over 30 days since the charge. The best part is that they charged me on Feb 22nd and I received my credit card bill on March 30th !! - no way to win. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !"
5,One of the finest !!!,"Sam McClain has a great voice for the blues. Every track is performed with conviction and each one is a success. Excellent studio recording. Instruments are played with great skill. McClain operates at a different level than other blues artists. His voice, the lyrics and the band all come together to move you at the gut level.I don't know why this disk is hard to find. There should be millions of copies selling and hundred of reviews with 5 stars. Even the $30 JVC label has been out for sometime.I strongly recommend it even if you don't like the blues. After your first listening sesion you will be happy that you made your purchase."
1,Non-working Disc,The disc arrived. It does not work. the word bad appears on my dvd player.Someone ripped me off.
1,BAD DEAL,Have bought this watch for the last three years. The last two started getting slower and slower.Changed batteries did not help very dissapointed!
4,needs a handle,"i have this one and the one with a handle (different maker). the handle is much more useful and comfortable, but this one shaves twice as much! so if you don't mind not having a handle, I recommend this one. much more productive! and plus, I like the protective case it comes in."
5,I love this zester.,I keep a supply of frozen garlic and ginger which I grate using this awesome tool. I love it for citrus zesting as well. The zest is the perfect size. It washes easily enough and the cover makes it easy to slide into a drawer without concerns of grating skin.
5,Great zester! But be careful!!,"I have spent hours in my kitchen preparing lemon zest for a catering job, using a traditional garnish zester. But since I bought my Microplane, I have thrown all my other graters and zesters away. This simple little file, that looks like it belongs in a toolbox, not a gadget drawer, is one of the most useful tools in my kitchen. It is an amazing timesaver. Minimalist design makes it seem like a work of modern art. But, a warning for prospective users - if you've ever ground your knuckles into a box grater, be careful on this tool. I looked away from my work for one second and ended up grating down to the bone on the second knuckle on my index finger. This baby is sharp!! Really sharp!! Until they make Kevlar knuckle guards, pay attention to what you're zesting. I use it all the time, but I have a cautious respect for it now."
5,Exactly As Advertised,"I needed a good zester to make lemon Angel Food Cake. This product is WONDERFUL. I can't believe I didn't buy this product years ago. If you like to bake, and need to zest citrus peels, don't hesitate to buy this item."
5,"Super Sharp, Super Fast","My Mom gave us one of these for Christmas and we use it frequently. I did suffer ""Skinned Knucle Syndrome"" once, so now I wear my cut-proof carving glove on the hand with the food in it. The zester is easy to use and clean and comes in a protective storage sleeve."
3,looks cool!,"my son is almost 7 months old. this toy did not hold his interest long. he has good finger control (he feeds himself with a loaded spoon or grabs food), maybe that is why this toy is not offering a challenge. i will bring it out in a few weeks and see if his reaction to it changes."
3,"I like it, baby does not","This is cute- the balls slide, the string is stretchy, and the parts are made of wood. Baby does not like to play with it though. He's looked at it a few times but barely picks it up. I don't know...it just doesn't keep his interest."
3,A little high priced,"I purchased this toy for my 9 month old grandson. He likes it, but it does not keep him entertained for very long. It is very durable, but I thought the price was a little high for what you got."
2,Dangerous for Little Ones,"I purchased the skwish for my six month old. He absolutely loved it - found it very interesting, and just right for putting in his mouth. That's where the problem lies.Any one of the ends can go right into his mouth. The elastic stings have plenty of give in them and it would be very easy for him to do serious damage to his throat (or worse) if he fell over on the toy or otherwise got it shoved to the back of his throat. It's marketed for 0+, but it's dangerous for the little ones who are putting a lot of things in thier mouth and who may not be completely steady yet. This one's being put away until he's much older - and I'm not sure how fun he'll think it is then."
5,A nanny's favorite,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for a 1 yr. old that I nannied after watching her choose this toy time and time again at playgroups. It kept her interested for a long time and she never tired of it! The beads and strings are a favorite for little ones just learning to use their ""pincher grasp"" skills... I plan to buy it for my own little one!"
4,Good Little Toy,"I thought this toy was going to be a great hit but it has just been an average toy in a large collection of toys. As my daughter has grown, she has played with it infrequently for the past two and a half years. My youngest is now starting to infrequently play with it too. It is very well made and still looks new after some abuse. All in all, a good toy but not a giant hit at my house."
4,I recomend this,my daughter is 14 months old. I bought this to keep her entertained in the car on trips. It workes for about 1/2 an hour and then she has to go to something else but eventually comes back to it. We have to rotate toys a lot. I wish I could find something that would captivate her for hours but I guess she is just not that kind of kid. I really liked this toy and the sounds it makes when moved. It comes in a couple of diffrent colors. My daughter chews on it and it has really held up against her teeth.
1,It's FAKE!!!!,"if this was real footage it would be considered a ""snuff film"" which is illegal in America, that being the case, it couldn't be sold on Amazon if it was real.also, there's 8 sequels. There's no way it's real.this entire piece of crap is staged and home-made."
3,A bit firm,"Nice item, but a bit heavy for sleeping. I am sure it would work good for theraputic purposes, I did not use it. I am looking for something light for sleeping."
2,not very good,"I could barely notice a scent in mine. It doesn't cover the eye/nose area very well so light can come through. It was nice if you like having a bag of sand laying on your face, it is very heavy and I really don't think it touches any ""pressure points"". Also, the straps that hold it on your face aren't adjustable, so it doesn't fit very well."
4,Informative but filled with bias,"This is a book that gives you limited insight into one of the most influential (negative & positive) men since Franklin, Jefferson etc. Filled with many instances were the author inserts his view point, I couldn't help but wonder what he left out in order to sway the readers opinion against Carnegie.Also it would seem that beside inserting his opinions throughout, Krass used letters from Carnegie and others as his foundation for the book - this takes little effort and seems a bit lazy. If Krass had spent a little time consulting with economic and business historians, he very well could have written a well balanced perspective of Carnegie.I can't wholly recommend this book unless you have read other Carnegie books and are looking for more insight just remember to cut through the opinion and bias."
2,Book without a heart,"Why is this book is so unsatisfying? Is it because Carnegie was an egotistical drudge, a control freak, and a boring person? Or is it the writing, which seems bland and overly detailed to the point of mind-numbing? Could it be both?"
3,Pretty good,"I'd say this book is pretty good though njot as good as Titan, the book on Rockefeller. This one is interesting and well-written, though not as engaging as Titan.Still, deserves a read."
5,Great reading..great lessons..great motivation! Buy it!,"Peter Krass has done a masterful job of delivering Andrew Carnegie's world to our intellectual doorstep. As he traces Carnegie's rise to power and success, the author weaves in fascinating stories and interesting details of Carnegie's ""wheeling and dealing"" lifestyle that makes this a real page-turner!As you are reading the book, you become part of Andrew Carnegie's world and get to enjoy a firsthand view of the sometimes shocking (and always fascinating)realities of the late 19th Century business world.This book is a rich history of a man's trials and tribulations as we follow his meteoric rise up the ""totem pole."" He is the epitome of the American Dream. Carnegie's drive, business acumen and motivation..and eventual philanthropy are truely inspirational and serve as valuable lessons for anyone trying to survive and prosper in the business world of 21st Century!You WILL enjoy this book!"
1,Huge disappointment!,"I ordered six boxes of these glasses = 24 of them. Out of the 24, only six were salvageable after shipping. They were not packaged properly - absolutely no bubble wrap used - and were shattered. I will NOT order something breakable like this from Amazon again. This is a huge disappointment!"
1,Out of date,"It was my fault that I purchased this book without looking at the publication date, which was 2001. I'm sure this book was good 9 years ago, but the technology of epublishing has changed so much that this book is now redundant. This book is in the pile for the secondhand store already, even though I only received it yesterday."
4,Perfect for study,"This Shakespear A to Z is easy to use, and I like having the information at my fingertips when studying."
3,"Good, But too Modern.","On one hand this book is a valuable tool. It offers summaries of the plays, historical production dates, close looks at different characters, and interesting comments. On the other hand, it is too modern. Too many of the Boyce's opinions judge Shakespeare's writing by modern standards. Many English Majors (myself included), abhor Marxist beliefs. The reason is that literature reflects a SPECIFIC TIME, PLACE, AND ERA. It is NOT RIGHT to condemn an author because his work does not fall into the contemporary political slots (whatever they might be at the moment). I suggest this book for the plot synopsis sections. (They are very helpful.) But I would not judge the plays by the Marxist theories presented."
1,Brilliant Rhinestones: Vintage & Contemporary Jewelry,Lots of nice photos in this book but there is very little information about dating jewelry. Vintage and contemporary jewelry are mixed together so a newbie will not know what is old and what is new. It looks like the author took pictures of all her jewelry and then added values that a seller could only dream of getting. There are many jewelry books out there that are very informative but this is not one. Don't waste your money!
1,Not Informative or Realistic,"Little information, very inflated prices on low end costume jewelry. Misleading for novices, no information for seasoned collectors. I wish I could sell things at these prices!"
2,Dull Rhinestones. Nothing Brilliant Here,"I purchased both this book and the sister companion, 20th Century Jewelry and felt that it was on my list of one of the worst photographed books that I have seen. There are two others by this same publisher that are lackluster in photography. Little information about the jewelry history is included in both books. While I appreciate all that the author has going for her (no doubt the other review was written by her husband), a little more attention to photography detail would have made this book much more enjoyable. I felt that the prices were a little over inflated which is a shame for both books because gorgeous jewelry is featured, just lousy photography to show them off."
5,Worth every penny and then some!,"Ever-evolving, Govinda's latest (which I purchased through CD BABY)is awesome. If one were to play his entire discography end to end, one would be able to see the growth and wonderful transitions an artist can go through. When purchasing a favorite artist's latest album, I always wait in trepidation. I feel I didn't waste a dime, I gained another part of the masterpiece that is Govinda. So take any review you see of this album with a grain of salt. But, I LOVED this album. I only wish I could have been in Austin to hear its premiere."
2,Not great,"I bought this cd because I like world beat and electronica, but overall I thought it was not very interesting. It seemed to lag in parts where it should been more explosive, in terms of the groove. It made me fall asleep, which if it was what they were going for, they achieved it. My advice is to try Tangerine Dream."
5,2002 to 2007 AND THIS OLYMPUS IS STILL GOING STRONG,"It's going on 2008 and this Olympus 2100 is still going strong. It is not a camera that's been on the shelf waiting to be used. It's been in at least half of ths U.S. taking pictures the whole way from Disneyworld to the back woods of Maine. If this camera is an example of Olympus quality, I am waiting for the equivalent of this camera to come out today. I see lots of cameras out there but when you get down to it, this old camera does everything they do. If anybody can suggest it's equivalent, please add on to the messages on this page."
5,Absolutely what I was looking for,I chose this camera choosing between pixels vs lens.I preferred less pixels in view of the reviews I read regarding the lens and I made the right decision.Pictures are great enough but the 10x zoom is remarkable!Don't miss it!
3,What is not in the package that was advertised on the review,"The camera is great until you try to download your pictures. You better have your batteries charged up, because there is not a AC power cord included in your Olympus Camera Box. And you will also need to buy additional supplies if you want it to download your pictures to your PC. Such as a USB reader with cartridges which will be another ...($$$). I wish I had been informed of these small details before I purchased online. I tried and tried to download the said pictures only to find I needed more hardware than was included in the package."
2,"Great features, very poor images","I have owned, and returned 2 of these cameras, and I prefer Olympus. The features, from 10X OPTICAL zoom, to noise reduction for open shutter exposures, are terrific. Two bad the images recorded are unuseable."
5,New territory,"This camera opens up whole new realms of use, thanks to the STABILIZING 10X telephoto. You can nab wildlife in the field and take the images home to the field guides. You can collect human behavior at its most candid and beautiful, because you're at a distance where the camera is effectively invisible, even if the subject knows you're shooting. You can do serious telephoto in low light because the stabilized lens permits low shutter speeds.I only wish it had Compact Flash storage as well as Smart Media, because the joy of digital shooting is that you can just blaze away and then cull once you've dumped to the computer. This is my third Olympus digital camera (after the 2500 and the 490). I keep all of them busy."
5,"Great pictures, great features","The only negatives that I have found are heavy battery consumption and the old memory card.The picture quality is terrific, and it is obvious that this is a camera designed for SLR enthusiasts- all kinds of control, or just set it all on auto and fire away.The image stabilization makes the 10x zoom useful, and the video mode was an unexpected bonus.If you have to have the next best thing, this is not it. If you love having top of the line N-1 technology, you'd be hard pressed to beat this camera for the money."
5,"Zoom, quality is impressive, VIVID pictures, WOW !","Had to decide how many MegaPixel's I needed first, and most printers today can not even begin to take advantage of the 4 and 5 megapixel cameras unless you are planning on printing a lot of pictures larger than 8X10.So after deciding on a 2 or 3 MP camera, I needed lots of zoom for sporting events, and image stabilization cause I'm not always steady. This camera delivered in all areas I needed, and I could not be happier with the qaulity of my pics. I shoot in SHQ mode, stay away from shooting uncompressed TIFF's. Pics are so real, WOW!"
1,Dropped Dead,"After 10 months of fabulous sound, ours just stopped working one day. Very disappointing. We got it as a gift, so have no idea where to return it or how to get it fixed.... an update, I contacted Bose and am sending it back, but even though it is under warranty and less than a year old, they're charging me $99 to fix it and $15 to send me a box to ship it back in! I'm not impressed... it did have great sound though, while it worked."
2,Great sound but lots of power usage when OFF!,"This unit produces some very good sound with bass. However I should note that the system uses between 5 to 9 watts of electricity when the system is off! That is, the ipod is off.The bottom of the unit is warm to the touch as is the power brick. It may never power down despite there being an ipod attached to the systema and whether the ipod is off or not. Bad design from an efficiency point of view.SO, it it is a great compact unit that won't disappointed with sound quality. However, be sure to unplug it when not using it!"
5,Best sound in the entire House,"I bought the Bose SoundDock for my wife's birthday a month ago and we put it in the kitchen area. It sounds great! The best sound in the house and all of my kids can play their ipods on it. The remote works great, but doesn't give you as much functionality as the actual ipod. We have only used it for volume and to skip to the next song, and turn it on and off. Overall, we are very happy."
4,Bose Sound Dock,The sound dock works just fine. The remote battery did not have enough power to operate the remote functions so had to be changed.[...]
4,Bose SoundDock for iPhone4,I now have had this product for a couple of months. It is not the most inexpensive solution. The SoundDock has met all of my expectations. The sound reproduction is more than acceptable when playing selections from my collections. The unit provides a full range of clear sound reprodution at all volume levels. If you can afford the investment I would recomend this dock.
3,One unit missed in review.,"Ok....been a fan of Bose. Have it in my Avalanche and home. However when I went to buy a ZUNE dock a year ago, they didnt have a player. I turned to the KZ500 from KICKER. This unit rocks and has great sound. Has minor issues-doesnt use batteries or no remote slot. check this out for your Ipod or Zune."
4,Bose is always good,"Good product, but I thought I was purchasing the portable system. Very disappointed that I made that mistake.To return it, I would have had to pay shipping plus a very handsome restocking fee.I tried just exchanging it for the more expensive portable one, without a restocking fee, but they would not allow that."
2,Not up to Bose standards,There is a distinct tininess to the sound. It is definitely not of the Bose standard of sound quality.
1,Worst service possible...stay,"away. They sent it to me half packed, broken item. This system NEVER worked!!!! Just looking at it when it arrived, you could see this was damaged. Just save your money and stay away from this company PERIOD!"
4,"Very good product, but a little pricey.","I know, I'm paying for the Bose name and quality. It is a quality unit and the sound is good. Had to reset it a few times before it synch'd with the iPod. It has worked flawlessly since. The remote really makes it cool."
2,Bose SoundDock for Nano Black,"I got the Bose system thinking it was the best available. Having been assured that Bose is a high quality product. It has been a huge disappointment. Problematic from the get-go. Every time I take the nano out of it and put it back in, the music will not come out of the nano nor will the remote work - until I've unplugged and plugged the system in numerous times. The slightest disturbance stops all music play. I do not recommend this system for a first time user. Save your money and get something far cheaper."
3,"Sounds okay, but other problems","Sounds pretty good, but its not nearly as good as some people seem to think (this is not some magic box). Also, the remote is a little spotty - it stopped working consistently a few days after we got it (we'd press the buttons and nothing would happen). So we replaced the battery ($4 btw), which turned out not to be the problem. The remote still works around 90% of the time, but that other 10% is annoying as %&*@!. The problem is that if the remote doesn't work, you're out of luck - there are no controls on the unit except for volume. We may have gotten a lemon, and we may still return it (if we can - the return policies are lousy), but overall I'm not so sure I'd buy it again."
2,Compatibity with IPOD NANO,"This Bose system does not charge an IPOD nano 4th generation.Bose does not give me information about it or what to do.ITUNES-IPOD does not have a solution or help at all.If you do know what to do (anyone) tell us, we will like to know.Gracias."
1,Never received my product,"The Bose I-pod Docking Station was not delivered by UPS as they stated it was. I disputed the charge on my credit card and it was resolved. I ended up purchasing this item from Target after all. I have to wonder where the package ended up. In hindsight, I should have had it shipped to my business address.I cannot rate this product here on this site since I never received it, but since the field is required, I only gave it one star.Thank you for the follow up."
1,Don't bother unless you never want to remove the ipod from it,"Bought the sounddock about a year ago. Worked great for awhile then the sound stopped just randomly. Checked the ipod - fine. After calling Bose tech support, found out that a common problem with this unit is that the leads in the ipod connector have weak solder joints and after repeated insertions and removals of the ipod, the solder joints can break. They wanted over $200 to fix it since its out of warranty. Great, its going to the landfill. I won't buy another Bose product."
1,hissing noise,"I have the same problem as one of the other reviewers: I get a high-pitched noise whenever my iPod Touch is in the dock, whether it's on or off. Google around and you'll see that others have had this problem. The problem is not my iPod, either--I've tried this with two different generations of iPod Touch with the same result. Nor is it, as some have suggested, a problem that fixes itself when you turn the wifi on the iPod off. It is just outrageous to have a problem like this on an item in this price segment. One fellow on the Amazon rating page here suggests opening the unit up and tinkering with the wiring; I haven't tried that yet, I confess. But do you really want to buy a product that requires such shenanigans?"
4,Solid Sound but Weak Physically,"I bought this because of the great sound. My only issues with it are physical in nature. First of all, you have to have the remote to control it which is a pain. If they want to make the remote mandatory then there should be a slot to store it. Mobility is an issue because you have to remember to bring two items with you, three if you count the power supply. Secondly, the hidden tray that docks the ipod is flimsy and can probably be easily broken off if not careful.But as far as sound goes you can't beat it and if sound is your main criteria then this is definitely a unit you should get."
2,Mixed Feelings...,"I have always loved Bose products, and the quality of sound from this product didn't disappoint me at all. However, I have very high expectations from Bose that this product didn't live up to. It's my understanding that most sound docs will charge the iPod while it's connected, but this one does not. Perhaps it is defective, or perhaps it's a low end product... perhaps my expectations were just unrealistic. I can't be entirely sure."
1,Piece of junk,"I do not know who designed this particular sound dock for Bose, but some common sense would have been useful. As pointed out in other reviews, the connection between the ipod and dock fails after some use. If you look closely at the product, there is clearly very little support for the area where the ipod is docked and it has some movement (it might even appear that it is designed to adjust up or down). After some use, that movement breaks the solder that connects the wires between the speakers and the ipod and the sound stops.What is more incredible is that Bose kept producing this design for many years. I have seen at least 3 sound docks with this problem. It just makes me F&%^# angry that they did nothing to correct the problem (I bought the sound dock after it was in the market for awhile)."
4,Nice.,"It was as described, still in the box, and I think it was a very successful purchase at a reasonable price."
2,BOSE is not great as people expecting and Advertised,"Bose has Stylish look But its not good ipod dock station. It has bright speakers. when u turn it on,u will feel like.. u got a best one but its not. It has more treble sound it may make you to feel like it has more clarity. its just a boosted treble.Also, if you listen more than an hour in medium voulume. u will feel like annoying and irritating feel. Thats because of its bright speakers. Its not long listening iPod dock station.About BASS, if u stand or sit close to BOSE Ipod Station, you may able to feel the BASS sound. if you move out couple of feet, you wont feel the BASS sound at all. im not expecting the big home theater sound result in small ipod dock station. but it should have it own basic level bass to feel it in the 10X10 room.Im wont recommend this to my friends. its not worth to the money. you can keep this as your status symbol not for real good music"
5,The best,"If you like minimalist stuffs, real sound, top of the line gadgeds, them, this is for you !!"
2,Bose Sound Dock,"I bought the product ""slightly used"" and it broke very easily and quickly. Of course, there is no recourse for a used prouct."
4,Bose Soundock Digital Music System,"I tell ya, this thing is fantastic. The sound quality is amazing."
2,full disclosure in product description,"This review does not address the actual piece of merchandise, the Bose SoundDock II for the iPod, because the iPod was not compatible with it. The description of the product should include limitations and compatabilities. The SoundDock II did not work with the 3rd generation iPod (the one that charges its battery through the FireWire port). A call to the company confirmed that the SoundDock II was not compatible with that generation of iPod, but this fact was not included in their product description. A lot of hassle, and shipping charges, to the buyer and the seller could have been avoided if this known limitation was revealed in the product description."
3,Good while it lasted,"I purchased one of these from Sams Club. The sound quality was good while it lasted. Key word is while it lasted. In less than six months it suddenly stopped playing music, but was still charging my iPhone. I took it back to Sams Club and they were nice enough to refund my money.Pros:Great sound qualityElectronically shielded, which is good if you are using an iPhoneRemote is convenientCons:Lacks an audio input, which is bad, because for $300 it would be nice to use these speakers with my televisionLasted less than six months; Maybe mine was defective$300 MSRP, almost as much as the portable SoundDock. You can get a system with comparable sound quality and more features for $100-150 from Logitech"
2,"Good sound, but no aux input severely limits the device.","Needs any form of aux input and there is no simple/easy work around. Sure it is fine if you only want to dock and play your ipod and don't want to use the device for anything else, but even with just the ipod there are a lot of times where I would like to play and surf through songs and I can't do that with the ipod docked to the sound dock. Maybe I should buy a $40.00 dock extension cable because Bose failed to include something so basic as an aux jack."
3,Not Julia's best,"I recently finished reading 'The Book of Color' by Julia Blackburn, which I didn't think was too bad. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that I didn't understand exactly who the characters were until part three and there are four parts to the book, so that wasn't good. I read the jacket of the book before I actually read the first page and now that I've finished the book I wonder if I read the book that the jacket was talking about. It was entirely different from what I expected. There were only a few things that matched up with the story. It's not a book that I recommend other people read although the pig's part in the story was amazing and the ending was brilliant. The storyline was confusing, the plot wasn't easily discernable, and the order of the scenes is all over the place. The story itself just wasn't good enough and I feel bad saying that because it was well written, interesting, and I loved Julia's book 'The Leper's Companions'."
3,Good bedrock information,"I was amazed at how much I took away from this book considering it was published in 2002. The practical chapters were pretty worthless, except for a history lesson, but the authors' approach to strategy is as right on today as it was then. There are a lot of practical tips here for formulating strategies for raising funds online. I wish the authors would do an update."
4,Very useful!,Very useful for organizations working with an interactive agency to imporve their efforts on the web...
1,The wrong debate,"Jeanne Chall believed the great divide among philosophers or teaching literacy were the group that believed in comprehension, and the group that believed in ""coding"".Actually, the thing that assures the successful acquisition of meaningful literacy for rising first-graders is the ability to make a mental image of a written one syllable word. Maria Montessori wrote this almost a century ago, and found that adequate practice printing alphabet letters in pre-school assured success in this area. Incredibly, no one has ever published a study to see if sufficient printing of alphabet letters before first-grade assures this ability. I have such a study but the establishment does not want it published. If you would like a free draft of our controlled study report in email form, please request one from me (Bob Rose)at rovarose@aol.com."
3,Theme song,"What happened to the old Scooby doo theme song? The version on this DVD set is inferior. Copyright issues prevented its inclusion? Also, Scrappy Doo needs to be banished."
2,not worth it....,"This sounds like a really great idea, but I've used it once and will never again. It doesn't quite fully cover the mattress and the edges curl up a little. That would be ok, but fussing with all the snaps is a pain and takes way too much time. I can take the mattress out of the crib and put a new mattress pad & sheet on in less time. I never really used bumpers w/my kids as they aren't considered safe once they can move, but when i did I found I only had to untie 2 sides of the crib and lift up the other to get the mattress out - so it was quick to do.I'm still giving it a couple stars because if you have a very heavy mattress you don't want to lift, or use bumpers for a long time this might be a worthwhile product for you."
4,Virus Hunting by Gallo,This is a good book for scientific study and evaluation ofviral strains-their etiology and treatment approaches. Theresearch of cancer-causing retroviruses is discussed in humans.These viral strains may be carried from chickens to people.The retrovirus in chicken sarcoma and oncogenes when incorporatedinto the genetic code of a virus quickly convert normal cellsto cancerous ones. Retroviruses can mutate. The work containsa good description of the development of the Elisa blood testingtechnique. This work would be perfect for a school project inscience or medicine.
3,Now I guess I understand all the controversy!,"If this book is any indication Robert Gallo must be one of the most narcissistic, self-absorbed people on the planet. This reads more like a summation for the defense than a historical account."
3,Meh...,"Found this book at the library while searching for helpful books for my science project... yeh, i'm a high-school student..and seriously, this book does have a lot of information...but, the book kinda really drags, and it's boring, and really,i didn't need to know about who found this little detail and who examined this thing at what time where and blah. it was full of trivial infos people don't really need."
5,Couldn't Put It Down!,The eight volume of this series just keeps you wanting more and more! This volume in particular is both haunting and exhilarating!
5,"religion and psychology find comon ground, no way!","I have been uterly amazed at how insightful this book has been. I have learned so much about the human psyche and how religion is interwoven with it. the most awesome stuff is on learning how we have an essence, as Ouspenski calls it, or as Jung calls it our Self that comes from God but we immediately take on our ego. from there it is a circle of our ego trying to identify with our true iner divinity (the Self)and it needing to be smacked down and go through an isolation period but for a healthy psyche, like a child, it must experience love, forgiveness, and aceptance.I highly recomend this book if like me you believe that psychology does not have to be anti God as Frued likes to dictate. I beleive that all things and all technology should be used apropriately for the betterment of man and to glorify God."
5,Fascinating book.,"Having read this book before, I have ordered a copy for a dear friend. Truly fascinating."
5,An excellent analysis of Jung's theory of individuation.,"Dr. Edinger explains the Jungian concept of individuation as both a psychological and spiritual phenomenon. Although the author does not explicitly acknowledge the underlying spirituality of Jung's concept of the self/ego relationship, it is apparent that he feels there is a metaphysical and spiritual basis to human development. Edinger, it seems to me, posits that the ego is a temporal construct rooted in a trascendental, timeless Self (soul). The text is filled with insightful accounts of many hermetic and esoteric concepts which appear in the Jungian corpus. Those who have read Jung's works on alchemy will find Edinger's interpretations illuminating. This is a wonderful secondary work on Jungian theory."
5,A fascinating insight into the Bible's message,This is the best interpretation of the Scriptures according to Jungian psychoanalysis. It is recommended to everybody who has doubts in the dogmaic Chrisitan way to read the Bible and it is a source for individual wholeness for those who try to find it in the Scriptures.
1,Surprisingly poor,"This book moves at a snail's pace. As ""a novel of the life and times of Wild Bill Hickok"" it does nothing to draw the reader in, and care about the characters. When the extensive dream sequence appears in the middle of the book, I was left wondering what King Arthur and the knights of the round table had to do with Wild Bill. Did I miss something? I suppose this is some inferior use of metaphor, but there had been no effort to set it up, and therefore it lacked relevance.Like the other review here I can't understand how this was a winner of the Western Heritage Award for Best Western Novel. I will stick with Spur award winners from now on. For readers who are looking for true western literature with metaphor and imagery, check out Win Blevins ""Stone Song."" That was a Spur award winner, and one of the best western themed books I've ever read."
1,This book is not modern,I have had the chance to use the book while living in Armenia and unfortunately the book uses words that are not modern and really dates itself. There were a few words and phrases that will help with basic communication but all in all this book was not helpful to me. I found that purchasing books in country much more helpful as they were modernized to meet the everday needs of life in Armenia
4,Good in General,"This is a good dictionary for general use.It is not that big, but it has most words that one would need to look up often. It is in Eastern Armenian (which I liked) and it is pocket size."
2,Not so good,I ordered these bars for my boyfriend and he wont touch them. They are chalky and the flavor isnt like other reviews said. Sorry!
5,they are yummy order them today,"they are nutritious, arrive quick, very filling. I dont eat these every day but throw them in my glovebox or gym bag in case i get stuck in a meeting or traffic and need to eat."
2,"taste good, lack of description of contents-poor advertising","tastes great.I don't have one on me now, but I was looking for something ""natural"" (i.e. no bloating/GI upsetting sugar alcohols to replace the sugars), relatively low carb or low glycemic carb high protein bar. This bar had like 18 gm of fat per bar. 472 calories per bar. not really stated on the description when I looked. So, I don't want to really eat them on our clean eating/p90x diet. I have found that the iss oh Yeah wafers,or Bionutrioinal's wafers are goof choices.Cliff builder bars are higher calorie (270) with 20gms of mostly soy protein (not as bio available as whey) with low GI carbs, so also a good choice."
1,"Oh my god, these are awful",I thought since the Chef Jay's Trioplex cookies are so good I'd give the bars a try. Bad idea. They taste terrible. I grabbed one to eat for breakfast in the car and I only took a second bite because I knew I'd be starving later if I didn't. But I was seriously gagging a little before each bite. I threw most of it away. Awful. Just awful. Definitely sticking with the cookies.
2,Title is misleading.,"I got this book from the library before purchasing thinking it might be composed of specific tips or tools for addressing urges, cravings, negative thoughts, etc. It's not. While it is well-written and there are useful insights they're more in the category of finding value from people sharing in AA--not thought/behavior changing/managing tools specifically. And I don't say this pejoratively but is very much within the AA tradition. If you are looking for non-12 step approaches to recovery this isn't it :).The Amazon rating system doesn't serve this category very well. The book isn't a 2 in the sense that it's poorly written or structured. The self-help category really needs a ""I found this book useful/did not find it useful"" scale. Or something.I _was_ left with one question specific to the content as presented. Is drive-by counseling really a good idea? I found the response to #75 verging on the cavalier. It probably made for good radio, but to me it seemed cruel."
4,Takes Me Back,"This album takes me back to a time when music was more civilized, when music was music and not noise. Ralph Flanagan basically plays the Glenn Miller sound. Although I am a BeBop Jazz fan, this band reminds me of dances I used to go to as a young man. It may sound corny to the younger generation, but it's pure nostalgia to me. When the young dudes become old social security dudes, they'll have their ""I can't Get No Satisfaction"" to remember. I got mine."
1,"Terrible program, terrible service.","Wow. This product is just abysmal. I'm appalled that it is sold at all - the software that has actually installed on my computer is sloppily put together, and the rest won't properly install on Mac OS 10.5. Customer service is non-existent. I keep on getting canned technical service responses that have nothing to do with the problem that I describe.I'm trying to get a refund from this shabby operation and they still haven't responded. I have a feeling that I just kissed a lot of money good-bye.I cannot warn you enough not to waste your money on this product."
2,Music stores are better.,"I tried ordering this from Amazon on a whim as the music stores are on the butt-end of town from where I live. I have enjoyed Jones reeds in the past, so thought I'd give ordering off the web a try. I ordered two - one worked great, and the other is leaky and sounds awful. They also took a couple of weeks to ship. In the end, the convenience factor wasn't all that convenient, and I'm going back to ordering in the store where I can see the product before purchasing."
4,extension of ogden's relational perspective,An excellent in depth exploration of reverie and interpretation from an intersubjective perspective.clinical examples are clear and distinct in their depiction of the codetermined nature of the analytic third and the overall analytic process.
5,Still going strong,"Had it for 5 years same hard drive in it, it is tight fit & seems warm to the touch but have never shut it off since I put the original drive in it. Amazing I know, but true for me, one thing that makes a difference is I use it for extra PC space overflow so the drive is never shut off and moved, it's still in the same place I sat it 4 years ago & has NEVER been powered down. I'm a believer in never shutting off the units unless I absolutely have to, over-heating will kill an electrical device, but even worse on electronics is cold power ups. I came here looking for another one for a old drive I'm putting back in service (never have enough storage it seems) I am disappointed to see they aren't available."
4,A Great Bargain for the Money!,"I've had my scanner about 2 weeks and have found it very satisfactory for the uses I had intended. I was especially surprised at the good quality of the color copies, which I usually send as e-mails and don't copy (photos, magazine, clippings, etc.). The frustration some reviewers have felt is EASILY ELIMINATED if you BE SURE THE SCANNER IS TURNED ON WHEN YOU TURN ON THE COMPUTER! I had some fury with the computer saying the scanner wasn't turned on, too. A patient customer service person gave me the simple advice that has worked everytime - either leave the scanner on all the time OR just make sure that it's turned on and the 15 second test is complete before you turn on the computer. I love reading about other people's rage knowing there was such a SIMPLE solution!"
1,Sending mine back,"I had alot of trouble with my scanner and will be returning it. Probally will look for another brand. The installation and set up was real easy. After that I couldnt get it to work. Every time I tried to scan I got a message that the scanner was not plugged in or turned on. It was on! each time I'd click on ""OK"" the message kept coming back on. I found if i rebooted i could scan with out getting that message. Had to reboot everytime I tried to scan. Once I got past this, I always get a message that said ""an unsuspected error has occurred. the application is unable to recover and will close. Contact vendor if problem persists"". Well Idid just that and am sending the scanner back."
3,"good, dependable, slow","I have had this scanner for over a year now. It produces very good images, but it takes forever to do it! One interesting thing I found was that the scanner came with the old, Foto Snap software, insted of new acclaimed ScanWise software, so I thought I would download the new software and make it better and faster. Was I wrong! It took twise as long to scan a picture!I would recommend this scanner to first time buyers who do not need speed. Otherwise, look at USB scanners with more user friendly software."
2,Returned scanner,"No matter what I did, I couldn't get this scanner to work. I don't know if it was my computer, but I tried EVERYTHING to get it to work. The reason I'm writing is because the AGFA tech support was very supportive and very patient. I don't know if the scanner will work for you, but if you have any problems, you can count on the tech support."
3,"Barkin, Fishburne Out for Blood...",...forget the overused plot line of cross and doublecross in this 1990's noir like thriller. Watch Barkin and Fishburne do some serious sneering and smirking as the plot gets twisted and contorted and convoluted...Beach and the two gov't agents are so sleezy you can see the greed dripping from their pores. Good movie.
1,Bad DVD,"The packaging was damaged & so is the disc. It had been years since I had seen this ""thriller,"" which is why I purchased it. Unfortunately, I won't be seeing it as soon as I thought. :("
5,HELP.,I'm trying to figure out the name/artist of a song that plays during this film. It plays about 16 or so minutes into the movie in the backround when detective rock walks through the crowd to meet king kao at his hideout. I don't think it's on the album cuz I listened to all the samples. Someone help me out please! Thanks.
3,Got da bounce,"For those whove seen the movie, you've heard the songs. They bring out the true bounce and rhythm of the movie. As soundtracks go, the produces of this album did a good job in mixin the artists and the sounds. This is one you need for you collection to keep you moving at high speeds."
3,A better opinion,"the track is phat! sweet beats lace the whole album as well as silky smooth lyrics. anyone who likes rap with a beat should buy this album, it was hard to find a bad song on the whole track. song after song had great beats that flowed smoothly. the movie was great and the sound track compliments the movie like cake and icecream!"
5,Purchase for grandchild,Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - NaturalI purchased this item for a grandchild-to-be. It was the second one I bought; the first for a different grandchild--different parents. The parents love this solution. Saves space and keeps baby close at hand.
4,I like this a lot!,"I'm glad I purchased the mini cosleeper. The original would have been too big for the space I have. I read several reviews before purchasing, and I'm glad. It was easy for me to set up, and I plan to travel with it."
4,Works well as a basinet but didn't use the cosleeper function,Works well as a bassinet but didn't use the co-sleeper function. Difficult to setup and take down but once assembled felt sturdy enough. Only complaint is that it lacks 4 wheels so when moving you tend to scrap your legs/ankles against the non-wheel legs.
1,So very hard to setup!,Nice concept but you have to put the rails up in a certain order or they will NOT lock! One of the pins in one of the top rails got stuck in ours and we had to cut the fabric to lock the rail. They should make the covering so that you can see the mechanism (a little Velcro would be a simple fix). Instructions are not so helpful and a google search shows that many others have this same issue. I really thought my hubby was going to toss this thing out the window when we set it back up after a trip.It is not really even with the bed either so you still have to lift baby up and over a rail to feed and then back again. It's the back again part that always wakes baby up on the return trip.Also be prepared to purchase extension legs because without them it was not tall enough for my average size bed. Also do not buy the overpriced sheets just slip a king size pillow case over the mattress...they fit perfectly.
2,Nice idea but not so portable,"Bought this from a local retailer where we live. The device sits well by our raised bed and is at a comfortable level where we can see our son sleep and address his needs during the night. This product is sold under the premise that it is portable. It comes with a travel bag and when collapsed it looks like a Pack-n-Play.The problem we had is in setting it up and breaking it down. The locking system for the horizontal bars did not lock on the first attempt. In fact there were times when I was shaking the device just to get the horizontal bars to lock. Then going to unlock them to collapse the system was even harder. They have labels on the side that tell you where to squeeze to collapse the bars, but that doesn't always work. In trying to close this I ended up breaking one of the plastic wheels on the bottom.In short if you are getting this I suggest that you don't try to use it as a portable device. Just struggle with opening it up and leave it alone."
4,Safe but not so comfy for baby,"My 2 month girl sleeps max 2 hours at a time in this. The matress is very firm which is safe, but probably creates pressure points on her body.Pros: size good for small rooms, compartment space good for stock piling diapers, easy to move around, good quality frame and fabric, drop down side for co-sleepingCons: pricey, matress sucks, matress covers are specific to the brand and priceyOverall, 4 stars for safety, convenience, and quality"
5,GD&T,I recommend this book to anyone who needs to learn GD&T this is an essential learning guide. It has helped me so much.
5,MONTCELLO,I REALLY LIKE THE HISTORY OF THIS ONE I HAVE BEEN THERE ALSO VERY GOOD A FIVE STAR PLUS IN ALL FIELDS QUICK ON DELIVERY I WOULD BUY AGAIN.
4,Monticello dvd,"Wonderful memory of a past visit & wonderful information on Thomas Jefferson. It arrived in good condition, as described."
4,Make sure you need all four of them.,"Since each cell will fire around 2000 nails, make sure you'll use all four of them within 2 years or they'll expire and become useless.Also keep in mind that once you snap the cap on a cell, it's 2 year shelf life reduces down to about a month or so. Too bad amazon doesn't sell them individually for under $7 each for us DYI'ers."
3,"because you ""have"" to have them","They work great as the required drive propellant for Paslode's finishing nailer. As others have said you get 4 1n a box which is more than enough for any DIY project so if you can, pool together with a friend when buying. The quantity probably is no issue to a contractor that would use them up faster. I tend to get these locally so I can scrutinize the expiration dates."
1,The do not work in the paslode Li Ion trim nailer,Even though this item comes up as frquently purchased togeather when buying a new Paslode Li Ion trim nailer they do not work in this nailer. Also not a returnable item. Can then be used as paper weight to remind you not to follow purchased togeather suggestions.
4,Great framing nailer,"I bought this framing nailer with a bit of caution after reading some of the reviews. However, I'm very happy with it. It's lightweight, easy to handle, and smooth-running. As far as nails jamming, I think people may be confusing it with one of its features that I really like-- when you are down to 2 nails in the chamber, the gun won't fire-- it lets you know it's time to re-load.I would highly recommend this framing nailer. The only thing I may have done differently is to buy the clipped head version, as you can fit more nails per magazine as they are spaced closer together."
3,Not one of DeWalts finest,"I frame houses for a living, so I wanted to buy a nail gun of my own. I have always been impressed with DeWalts tools, so I'm sorry to say this is not one of their better tools. It doesn't deliver the power that it claims. I'm finding that it is not driving the nail heads through the lumber. After using the nailer I'm having to go back with my hammer to sink the heads."
1,51845 review,"I had the same bad exerience as several others. The gun has some good features but after a couple hours use something goes wrong, e.g., driver will not retract, every other nail bent, will not drive nails all the way. I have had it apart several times and put new O-rings in once. After a few magizines of nails it started acting up again."
2,Don't buy this nail gun,"I have been using the DeWalt D51845 framing gun for 2 years and it has been a huge pain. I own at least a dozen other DeWalt tools and love the weight, balance and durability of all of them...except for their big framing gun. It would constantly misfire - clearing jams was pretty easy with the removable clip and the attached hanger clip was nice...well, it started leaking air 3 days ago and quit at the end-of-day the following day. I bought the Hitachi NR83A as replacement and it is awesome. It worked great with no jams and has good balance."
1,Piece of crap,"For $200+ you would expect this to work well, it doesn't. I should have went to Harbor Freight and bought the cheap chinese one instead for $80. The dewalt does not fire consistently, frequently jamming. My guys have exclusively went back to hammers."
4,...,"I love this gun, tool free depth adjustment, rafter hook, magizine comes right off if you get jammed (which I haven't yet). I was looking at a Porter Cable model until I compared the weight of the two guns. DeWalt seemed much lighter. I'm happy with my choice and I am currently looking into DeWalt's finish nailer."
3,questionable quality control,"I purchased this nailer because it had some features that my Porter Cable did not. Tools free depth adjustment and the rafter hook. Right out of the box the tool leaked air from the back end. I tested it anyway and it felt pretty good except that the trigger is too far away from the handle and it was unable to really sink toe nails, even with the pressure turned up to 125 psi and the nose fully retracted. The nosepiece was better than the PC for toenailing but did not offer a mar free tip. I decided to send this one back. If it leaks right out of the box, I doubt that the rest of it is assembled properly. The Porter Cable also came with a really nice case, and the Dewalt with just the box it was sent in."
3,"Framing Contractor, Grand Rapids Michigan","My company consists of over 40 framers. We primarly use Hitachi guns. I purchased a Dewalt framing gun, and it was defective out of the box. My local rep. replaced the gun at no charge. The gun looks nice, however, it is my opinion that the gun is not well balanced, and although it is said to be a light weight tool, I have found it to be heavy, and poorly balance. I will not purchase another DeWalt gun. We currently have over 25 Hitachi guns running daily, and it seams to be a much better gun. The Hitachi is much better balanced than the DeWalt, and feels much lighter."
1,Piece Of Junk,"I purchased this nailer and used it in the majority of the nailing in two residential projects over nine months. Right out of the box the nailer was double firing (two nails in one shot). Although I kept it oiled daily, double firing and misfiring because the norm for this nailer using 3"" nails. I also had major problems with jamming... not just minor jams, but jams where two nails would get stuck in the chamber which was very time consuming to remove. With 3-1/2"" nails, the problems grew much worse. I bought several different brands of nails over then next couple of months, but had the identical problems with them all. It became a very frustrating tool and was not very dependable. I tried bring it in to a Dewalt dealer for a repair, but I was told that nothing was wrong with it. Finally, after nine months of fighting with this thing, it slid off a rail and the air inlet broke off when it hit the ground.This is my first Dewalt tool and certainly my last."
2,Junk,"We currently run a fleet of six of these guns and we cant keep more than three working at one time. Its either a stuck piston or a bent magazine. These guns just dont shoot very well either. At 120 psi they wont even counter sink 8d's into OSB sheathing, they leave about half the nails protruding a 1/4"". They are light wieght but they are poorly balanced. The nose piece is terrible, we have to jam the saftey's to make them shoot decently which is not a good thing to do! Overall these guns just arent up to the demands of jobsite."
2,51845 My thoughts,"I read the previous reviews and I got the impressoin that this nailer ""could"" do the job. Well I was wrong, this nailer went head to head with a bostitch N88ww nailer and I was crushed. The dewalt lacked the power to countersink 3 1/2 nails into some old pine. The best I could do is get a bearly flush head about 60 percent of the time. I tried adjusting everything I could to get the perfomance I expected from a dewalt tool. This nailer lasted about 30 minutes on site before it was back in the box ready to get shipped back."
1,Not for me,I was hoping for stories that were more deeply rooted. I find the writing was a bit weak and undeveloped.
1,bad.,"when i first got em i was very excited,bought som soil and planted themhowever......the seeds did not grow or germinate..... why?i dont knowbut it suckswill not buy agin"
5,Look what came from China...,"When I was preparing to visit China, I sought for more knowledge about China and their culture. Additionally, I wanted to know what things I should look when shopping. Americans buy so many things that say ""Made in China"", I did not want to bring home one of these items. This book ""Look What Came from China!"" by Miles Harvey was very helpful. There was just enough information to lead me to further investigate items for which I was interested. I have read this book several times to my grandchildren. They like to play a game with each other trying to see who can name the most things that came from China."
2,..hmm..,"Well. This is an alright CD. She's young, not all that talented. Heard better at her age. Musicianship is lacking. Could be because its their first CD. Who knows? Perhaps a lineup change is in order. Or perhaps I'm just a musical elitist. :)Quit with singing/playing other peoples songs and write your own. Playing other peoples songs is trying to make up for lacking any talent of your own. Not only did they have the artistic foresight to cover Hanson (note sarcasm), they actually succeeded in disgracing what was already an annoying song.. what's really sad is that the band can't play as good as the three hanson boys, but at least the hanson boys wrote it. They got outplayed by three pre-teen boys.They should stick to what they do best, and not disgrace further english pop songs."
4,Alien-lectro funk,Saw them open for the Chemical Brothers and was amazed at the pure funk coming out of their equipment...Alien music for the ear/mind-candy enthusiast
5,Seminal ElectoFunk Classic...,"A total classic. Released in 1996(wow!) but still sounds completly fresh. It actually sounds better than 95% of electronic music being released now in 2002- quite an accomplishment from purveyors of true Miami Bass. A space funk electro classic. Every track blips beeps and hits. From Miami to Mars, Detroit to Denver. One of the funkiest electro bass recordings ever released. If you have one single funky bone in your body pick this up. This is by far one of my favorite releases of all time."
3,Good,"I like this CD, but it is very repetitive. The tempo is about the same for every song -- an upbeat techno. Yes, it's a great CD to listen to, but don't expect the best songs ever. It's a nice background jam."
2,2 Stars is Generous,"I really wanted to like this book. I tried to like it. I bought it because of the blips comparing it to ""Confederacy of Dunces"" (which is absurd) and also because it does have a pretty interesting ""this looks to be entertaining"" premise.However, it was a frustrating one to get through. A few reasons: the main character is impossible to like (he spends most of the time whining...it gets old), most of the other characters are equally annoying and stereotypical, the wannabe-witty dialogue is anything but, and, worst of all, you just can't shake the notion that it could be pretty good."
2,fat white reader blues,"I tried, I really did, I kept looking for the magic that spawned the many five star ratings but I simply couldn't find it, in fact I simply couldn't finish it. The story started off promising enough and the reason for duchon's portliness, well that was just flat out original, hysterical and so timely what with the current obesity 'epidemic', and furthermore the reason it got the two stars. But aside from trashing the big easy in almost every chapter it just didn't go anywhere. I really wanted Malice X, or even....no especially Maureen, to rip Jules' throat out. Who knows maybe I'll try it again but for now it sits in my kindle home page just threatened to be erased. It's a shame because the title was brilliant. A real eye catcher, shame it couldn't hold one once caught."
4,The Anti-Rice of New Orleans Vampires,"If you like vampire tales, you just gotta love ""Fat White Vampire Blues."" Andrew Fox has written a fine and funny tale of vampires from the less elite and effete sections of The Big Easy. Not that I dislike Anne Rice's vampire tales, but after a while....""Fat White Vampire Blues"" is a b-movie of a book informed by pulp magazines, comic books, new age spiritualism, and, well, b-movies. The conclusion of the tale is a little unsatisfying, and Fox plays fast and furious with so many concepts of vampirism (both traditional and some his own creations) along the way that he leaves many unexplored in the effort to get his story wrapped up. Maybe that's not a bad thing. Jules could always return in a follow-up, and that wouldn't be a bad thing either. Even so, this book is just so much fun to read it's hard not to like it.As for any charges that the book is racist or homophobic ... give me a break. Methinks the reader doth protest too much."
4,Recommended! Second Best Vampire Novel this year,"I love vampire novels and this one is well written and entertaining. I love writers that write for the pleasure of the readers. Only Vampire Stripper by Patrick James is a better novel, but this one is better than most stuff by Pn Elrod or Anne Rice"
2,Disappointing ruination of a really good title,"As a vampire enthusiast, I wanted to like this book, very badly. Unfortunately, it was very bad. The second half of the book completely diverges from the first, and includes some unwelcome, unresearched, and frankly stupid additions to the vampire mythos.Run away. Screaming. For all the wrong reasons."
5,Best baby product,I love this product and feel good about using it on my babies. Great smell and great on the skin of your sensitive baby.
3,Strong smelling,"This is a strong smelling wash. I thought it would be pleasant like the Mustela no rinse wash and the foam shampoo, but it's much stronger. It smells very strong like an old lady's perfume. It was not what I wanted my baby boy to smell like. He sneezed in the bath when I was using it. I wish I could return it, but I used it once."
1,Smells like chemicals,"Strong chemical/perfume odor. My husband, son and I couldn't stand it!! Very malodorous, will be returning and going back to Aveeno products or other."
4,Love the smell,"Bought this for my first newborn son. Love the smell! And the texture is really smooth. I only wish it comes in pump so it is easier to use it while bathing my son. Other than that, this product is prefect."
4,I am using the second tube of Mustela on my baby,I like its 2-in-1 feature. It is mild and does not irritate my baby's skin like some of Johnson products do. I will probably stick to it until I find a better but not so expensive baby wash.
1,Horrible!,This wash is VERY perfumy! It made my eyes burn just smelling it so I was not comfortable using it on my baby. The only reason I gave it one star is that it did seem effective to getting rid of cradle cap... But I could not get over the smell...
3,Nothing special,I heard a famous tv mom raving about this product online so I thought I would give it a try.I didn't think it was anything special and I went back to using Phisoderm Baby which has awonderful scent and cleans really well.
1,poor quality,"This video DVD is exemplary for its poor packaging, and poor quality. I can't believe it costs so much. Please save yourself the trouble and find videos online. for free. i wish I had"
2,somewhat disappointing value,"This video looks like it was shot in the 80sand its iffy (hit or miss) on dvd players.It's just a disc - forget the packaging and DVD box set looking thing in the picture. That must be the VHS. Instead you get the DVD a cheap clear plastic jewelcase covered in platic wrap. Home style.Which is no big deal if the video was 20$ instead of $50. It's priced like a premiere premium A+ top quality product, not a geto self released product.I may return it due to the iffy playback. Seems like a DVD encoding issue, the menu keeps going and fights the image when the video starts - causing the image to constantly rip and pixelate.Aside from the value and tech issues the vid is decent intro.Nice basic steps for a foundation. youtube has tutorials for Pachanga, Boogaloo, and footwork. SO this is a nice complimentary piece. Exactly what I was hoping for."
5,Hidden Gem,This is without a hidden gem among the Salsa instructional videos on the market.We have had a copy for years & love it.It is really great for beginners & those who want to learn social Salsa dancing.Highly recommended.
3,Great Story - Terrible video quality,"In a similar vein as the previous reviewer's comments, I'd buy any copy of this I could get my hands on. I must say however that the video quality is VERY POOR, even for VHS. Should you know someone who taped this from TV, a second quality dup may be of higher quality. Be forewarned."
5,A masterpiece by Mitsuda.,"Yasunori Mitsuda has outdone himself with this release. Book soundtracks are something not quite heard of in the USA, in fact if this album had any other name on it, I would not have paid as close attention to it and labeled it as Gimmicky.I love this album and recommend it for any Mitsuda fan. It defines his body of work and fits the end of a hard day's work just as much as it does my private study time playlist."
5,The Darn Thing Just Toasts!!!,"This is the best toaster I have ever used or owned! It is very consistent if I put the setting on #3 and toast 6 pieces of bread the last one looks exactly like the first. I love it!, I actually can rely on this machine to do what I want it to do without fail. I never thought a toaster would excite me this much, my only regret is that I got the two-slice model instead of the four-slice model."
3,"A Well-Made, Reliable Toaster With A Flaw","The flaw is that the highest setting (6) does NOT toast an English Muffin adequately. Otherwise, a five star appliance."
2,At least it works,"I bought this from my Gold Box...I wouldn't recommend buying it at the regular price. Why not? Well, I call it my Forrest Gump toaster...you never know what yer gonna git. It does have a dial on it, but to my knowledge the dial has nothing to do with the color or degree of burntness of what's being toasted. You can dial 1 and get coal dust; you can dial 4 and keep your waffle frozen.However, it does have a handy little tray that pulls out so you can clean out the crumbs, instead of having to turn the thing upside down to open it for cleaning (saving the busy homemaker a whole second or two of precious time, I suppose); and it has rescued me from constantly burning my fingers on the element of my electric stove, a daily occurence when I was toasting bread on its broiler setting after my last toaster bit the big one."
2,It toasts,"We've been using this toaster for almost a year now. It seems to be getting less powerful with age! It now takes one and a half cycles to get the bread toasted enough, when it only used to take one cycle on 6. Oh well, so much for the ""IntelliToast"" concept but it still works. Nothing special, just a regular old toaster."
4,"Good gun, limited nail sizes","This nail gun has been flawless. The nails are easy to load, and visible when loaded so easy the check size and qty. (No shooting blanks with this gun)The only issues I have had with it are, limited selection of nails for it in the big Orange Store. And then using it for small trim when my Sears Brand 18 guage finish nailer wore out. This means now I need to upgrade and get the dewalt 18 gauge. I will aslo need to get a framming gun as well since this is not big enough to fasten 2X's."
5,Dewalt Nailer-GREAT,"I bought the nailer as a gift for my husband. He was always borrowing our neighbor's for home projects. Now that he has one of his own, more things are being done around the house. It's great for a novice carpenter."
4,Good quality heavy duty 15-guage nailer,"I purchased this nailer about 5 years ago. I've not used it as much as I thought I would. It is a very good nailer for what it is. But if you only want to do a small amount of trim work, it hardly worth while to get out the air hose. A small cordless drill and hammer are more effective timewise. If I were to purchase another 15-guage nailer, I would look into a cordless and airless version."
5,contractor grade,"I'm a contractor and use this gun everyday for everything from exterior trim in New England temperature extremes (many days in single digits)to interior trim and hardwood flooring. Thousands of nails fired, including stainless all sizes without jamming. Oil the gun daily and use 34 degree nails, you won't be dissapointed. Belt hook is good too, especially on pump jacks and wall brackets doing trim."
1,Not so great,"I've had this gun for a little over a year and it is a dog. It worked great the first time out but it has malfunctioned in some capacity ever since then. I've shot less than 300 nails with the gun and the first problem I noticed was the exaust leak. Since the second time I used the tool, it has had an exaust leak. I've broken the gun down, checked all of the seals, cleaned everything and the problem temporarily goes away but it always comes back. The more recent problem I've had is the gun stops firing. I have not figured it out but it seems the air releases but the hammer does not. When it happens, I'll repeatedly bump a scrap piece of lumber until it starts nailing again.I've maintained the gun well ... oiled it as instructed and really like the weight, balance and the belt hook. It just does not function consistently. I've since ordered a Senco FP41xp and I'm hoping it performs much better."
1,wrong part,cable was purchased and given to my son for Christmas and it is the wrong part will not fit a 1990-1991 geo metro it has a straight flange and geo is angled it is also 5 inches to shortwill not allow return
5,Dr. Somersall documents an interesting history of Immunocal.,"Dr. Somersall's review of the history and research into the nutritional benefits of Immunocal is well written and interesting. It is clearly written and easily understood by laymen. If one considers the complexity of the human immune response system, and the technical information surrounding glutathione and its roll in modulating the immune system, one must appreciate how Dr. Somersall makes exciting a subject which to some might appear dry. With the potential of a pandemic (worldwide viral or bacterial epidemic) such as Hepatitis C on the horizon, this book is indeed timely. It is a must read for anyone concerned with better health and wellness. - Jim Bobo, Houston, TX."
5,informative,"I have had the opportunity to come in contact with individuals that were able to share the research with doctor Buonos. We Know that our immune system is our life, this book describe in details how this amazing doctor was able to stumble across a formula that was able to help our bodies to produce on the cellular level glutathione, which is the master antioxident in our bodies. IT IS A MUST READ FOR all THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE CONCERN ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AS WELL AS THEIR LOVE ONES. You can visit [...] for more information."
5,Profound Life Saver,For a medical book we could not put it down. It is simple to read and captivating. It has made all the difference to us in our health and is impacting so many. An absolute essential for every health library
2,Pretty. Pretty useless.,"I bought these scarves to teach my mother and daughter how to juggle. They are too stiff and don't float at all. I am a pretty good juggler and can't get more than 5 throws before they float away like a leaf.On the plus side, they are much more brightly colored than the picture indicates. My daughter still loves to play with them. Too expensive for just another play cloth though."
2,not great for juggling,We bought these scarves to begin teaching our son how to juggle. The material is not of a very good quality and the scarves always stay creased making it nearly impossible to juggle with. They would be a fun and colorful sensory item for small children to play with. I just wouldn't recommend it for juggling.
4,Great addition to my shop.,"This item is well made, is a great tool and I am well pleased with it's performance. I shall inform the world about this wheelbarrow and its capabilities."
2,Poor quality phone,"If you're looking to buy a phone, don't put this one on your list. I've had it about two years and have had nothing but problems. The battery constantly needed recharging even though it had been replaced. The static was unbearable at times. Now, most of the buttons don't work and even though it's fully charged, it rarely works. Don't bother with this one."
2,"too much production, not enough soukous","There *are* a few good tracks on this disc, but Papa Wemba's all-soukous albums are the Genuine Article -- listen to him with Viva La Musica (his current working group) -- the groove is irresistible, the vocals soar (much more so than on this album) and you'll have a taste of what tout le monde really loves! (Nothing blanded-out or dull, certainment.)"
5,"Great Book not Only For Golfers , but for everyone","I bought this book because of my best friend . We are two golf junkies from Kentucky . We both have our favorite golfers mine being John Daly , his being the late Payne Stewart. I thought maybe i could one up him a time or too on Payne Stewart , and rib him a little but when i began and finished the book, it inspired me unbelievably . In the book , Tracey Stewart talks about the struggles of life and the PGA Tour. During Paynes fathers death , he was strong and held on to strive . It inspires you not to give up hope when life throws a curve ball at you . The book also shows how spirtuality , and setting priorities on life can help you out tremendously in the long run . Payne Stewart lived a great and inspiring life , and this Biography touches on all aspects of it . A Great book"
5,Outstanding,A well written biography. I learned the inside story about one of my heros and a lot about the sport of golf. My wife loved the compelling human interest story.
5,Golfing Career & Life Challenges,"An exellent book about the life of a golfer who had many challenges in life, both golf and personal, which were shared by his wife. It is a good book that both golfers and non golfers can relate to regarding the many challenges we are all faced with and the attempt to determine and understand what is most important in our lives. It is too bad that Payne's life was shortened since he just began to understand and execute his priorities for his life and set a role for others."
2,They couldn't tell the whole picture,"It is very sad that Payne Stewart was taken from us. His incredibly dramatic win at Pinehurst and his final putt will be a moment that will be imprinted in our minds forever. This book falls far short, however, of being complete, and I am not sure why it was written in the first place. Most insider's in the media world didn't really care for him, as he was as wild, arrogant and disrespectful too many there. Stewart did make some tremendous gestures in giving money away, but it still doesn't mean that this is a book that any non-golfer would need in their library. Hardcore golfers will like this book, but will find Michael Arkush's book much better. Non-golfers should look elsewhere for inspiration."
5,One of the best biographies of the year!,"The Payne Stewart biography authored by the late golfer's widow is one of the most moving, inspiring biographies I've read. More than just a sports book, or a book about a celebrity--the life and legacy of Payne Stewart, on and off the course, comes shining through. Each page reinforces the reasons why this story deserved to be told. Tracey Stewart describes her husband with candor and realism, tempering the emotion of her loss with the rock-solid assurance her faith provides that Payne is at peace."
4,one great man,"this book was amazing. granted it could have been written a lot better, but it's understandable from the view thata his wife is writing this book shortly after his tragic death. tracey wrote well, but got a little boring here and there. other than that, this was great. i never knew the story of payne and his career untill i read this. it was truley a proof to me that he was a great father, husband, golfer, friend, and man. enjoy it!"
1,Another attempt to capitalize,"Payne Stewart was an incredible golfer, and I loved how he stood apart from the other golfers with his knickers, but it is too bad that there is a flood of golf books out on Stewart because of his tragic death, this one included. Books that really capture the emotion and depth require a better topic and more time and care. Tuesdays with Morrie this isn't, as it resembles more of a ""instant"" book trying to capitalize on a tragic end to someone's end. I ended up asking myself if a book on Stewart would of been published if he hadn't died and the answer is no. If Morrie was still alive, the answer is yes. Put this one next to the Jon Benet Ramsey pile."
1,Work on your swing instead,"This book is what we don't need, self serving. There are some great golf books just out...The Greatest Golfer Who Never Lived and Dave Pelz's latest...so enjoy a great mystery and work on your putting, as the best memory we should have of Payne is his winning putt at last year's US Open."
2,Misleading Sound Clips,"I was looking for music to use during Tai Chi. The samples of the songs were just what I wanted. But, I was shocked at what I got. The music is avant garde and the samples don't reflect what the pieces are truly like. Whoever does the sampling should look for another job or at least listen to what the piece has to offer and try to reflect that.I got rid of all but two songs after listening."
5,One of the best!,How can a fan of Dragonlance not like this one! It is action-packed and has a great turn of events to it. I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!
4,"Wow, a Dragonlance sequel that works!","Richard Knaak is one of those writers who almost made Dragonlance work past the Weis and Hickman phase. Yeah, it's typical fantasy epic, nothing challenging or wonderful - but a solid epic fantasy isn't to be scoffed at. Page-turning fantasy near its finest, where you know the hero will emerge triumphant, but root for him(or her) nonetheless. Better fantasy is out there but this is worth reading if you like the genre."
2,A Shareware CDROM that's worth its price ($10),"BYTESIZE SOFTWARE Music Composer Professional (Windows) is a Shareware CDROM that's worth its price ($10). If you are just getting into computer music, you may find something helpful here. It is NOT a ""Professional"" CDROM."
1,Don't waste your time,"This camera's image quality is so bad Agfa should not even bother trying to sell it. The problem is with the camera's image compression algorithm. Instead of evenly dividing up the 2MB of storage space, they thought it might be a good idea to compression each image and cause so much data loss that images show excessive pixilation. I didn't have a problem with the 640x480 resolution or 8-bit color depth just the lousy fuzzy looking images the camera produces. If image quality doesn't matter to you, you might even like the camera's slick serial port hookup, compact size, and top mounted operations options window as well as the excellent Photowise image software utility."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I love the look and size of this camera. However, I was only able to view the images from my TV ( they seemed a bit dark). I was unable to download to my computer. The initial promotion didn't state that I needed to configure my modem to Com Port 1(as per their tech support). Also, I didn't purchase from Amazon.com - the other company's promo did not include the necessity of the RS232 serial. It has yet to be functional for me."
1,Short and sweet,I'll make this short and sweet:This camera realy suck quality wise.Its cheap and youll need alot of batteries.If you want to get something that wont go obsolete too fast than get a scanner
1,Not the best choice,"I bought the Smile to have a handy, inexpensive way of addingphtos to web pages. I didn't want to spend $400 on a camera that wouldbe obsolete in a few months. I figured for $100 I couldn't go wrong. I was mistaken.The Smile just has too many compromises. The lens is a tiny fixed-focus item that requires bright light to form an image. Battery life is abysmal- it seems to chew up a pair of AAs shooting a dozen pictures. I should have spent $200 and gotten a far better camera."
1,I Was a Loyal AGFA Customer Until I Bought THIS,"I have purchased a number of digital cameras over the last 2 years, including one from AGFA, the ePhoto 307 (A great little camera). The ePhoto Smile is an Affront to the AGFA brand name. The pictures are awful, the battery life abysmal, and worst of all, it would be a bad deal at 1/2 the price. I recently bought my youngest daughter a Polaroid Digital 320. It takes much better pictures, and we're still working on the 1st set of batteries . . . .. In short, don't buy this camera. If you really want to take digital pictures it's hard to go wrong with the Olympus 340R for under $300."
1,Do NOT even think about it...,"Pics were awful, it hogs batteries, unlike most digital cams there's no power adapter included. Save some more money and buy something decent. I had tried a Casio QV220 about two years ago it was a lot better than this and it was priced about $80 more than this two years ago, I would have thought two years time would have slashed the prices and this one would be about the same quality... WRONG... this camera does not worth it's weigh to carry with you. Pictures are really bad."
2,Disappointed,"The pictures don't seem to be as good as they should be. The cameria uses batteries quickly, and the flash is inadaquate. The software is simple, the uploading of pictures is efficient, but if it doesn't work, there aren't many diagnostics. But for [the cost] what do you expect? I think just a little bit more."
4,Great for the money!,I bought this camera so I could e-mail photos to my family and use them for web pages. I would not print out pictures for framing but do use it to print out small images for greeting cards. My expectations of this camera were limited to the money I spent. The supplied software for this camera makes it easy to get images into my computer and highly recommend using this for the first time user or someone that doesn't need a lot of features.
3,You get what you pay for,"I've heard that some Smile cameras apparently come with defective serial cables. I thought I had the same until I found that you have to push the connectors all the way into the sockets for the camera to work properly, or you get error messages. The camera is extremely small and light. I has a flash and a self-timer. And there is a bug when you connect to the computer which indicates that the camera's batteries are dead, but reconnecting the cable fixes this and shows the correct amount of battery power left. The pictures are basically awful but you can still make out stuff in the pictures. Great for fooling around with. Exactly what I use it for. Comes with batteries, software and a cool soft case. No AC adapter. Always runs on batteries. Needs special video capture card for video conferencing, if your video card is built into the motherboard. Your decision to buy it."
1,"Worse than I thought, but at that price...","I'm on a small budget this summer, so I bought this camera for fun. It doesn't drain your batteries before you even took a picture(I took about 40 pictures(without flash) with my cheap rechargeable batteries). The four stars missing is for the worst quality I've ever seen in my life. I suggest to never use the flash(all my pictures taken with flash were 90% full of light, so it's all white!)This camera is too cheap(I think that my batteries heavier than the camera itself)You only have to put the Cd that it comes with it and it installs itself.I think uploading my pictures(16) to my pc took 4 minutes!The camera was too easy to use and I wonder why Agfa made these things.Finally, digital cameras are too expensive and someday the prices will fall down and camcorders will take better pictures... you will regret buying this awful camera!"
3,Poor Resolution. Ease of use,It is easy to use and has no technical problems but the resolution is a bit poor. I am looking for some image manipulation software to correct this. It is an excellent camera to practice with.
2,just for babys,thanx god i get it as a prize the quality is very poor and i have a hard work trying to pass the pics to my pc and the batteries only works for 1 day or less dont buy it very poor quality
1,Sold it for $40...I think I ripped the guy off.,"It's a nice little TOY. That's all it is. It's just a toy...not a REAL camera. It's a piece of junk, and I'm really glad I got $40 out of it. If you're spending under $150 for a digital camera...you're wrong."
1,This camera is HORRIBLE!,"It is absolutely useless. The pictures are grainy, blurry, and have color aberrations galore. You can't even see facial features on people. It is not a true 640x480 camera; it uses software to obtain the 640x480 advertised resolution. Downloads are horribly slow, and the memory is not removeable, so you can't use a better download method. It will drain the batteries with only one loading and unloading of the 2MB memory. This thing is not even useful as a toy for your children. Fortunately I bought from a reputable online dealer who took the thing back, and even refunded all shipping charges. Do yourself a favor and get an Olympus D-360L or D-460Z. ...a lot more money, but about the least you can pay for a digital camera that takes decent pictures.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"
2,E-smile Digital Camera,The Agfa e-smile digital camera is not too bad for the pricebecause once you know HOW to use it correctly it really does takedecent pics.If you want a digital camera just for putting pics on webpages or sending e-mail pics to friends and family this is good for that. Camera can be used for video conferencing and can be hooked to vcr or tv to capture real time video imagaes I was ready to take it back but now I can use it for E-mail just fine just don't expect to get above average pics with this camera. END
1,Worst possible digital camera,I cannnot image that Agfa would even sell a camera that takes pictures this bad. This camera would not be worth it if it was free. DO NOT waste your money on this piece of junk. The pictures are absolutely horrible. This camera gets minus 5 stars if it were possible.
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,". STOP!!! . 1/ This camera is NOT 640x480, is a fixed 320x240. CCD is not even 1/3 megapixel, is 1/10 I think. Images are bad (like enlarging a thumbnail?) Print them in an 1x1 inch rectangle and they'll be somehow fine, anything bigger is like old CGA... awful. When you take shots they look very bad, whatever you do to edit (software) and fix them. I have another (true) 640x480 camera and pictures are excelent, but these...2/ It doesn't include an AC adapter, so be prepared to buy LOTS of AA batteries or spend another 50 bucks.3/ Fine as a serial videoconference camera (30 fps), but watch for the batteries.4/ Take your first picture, and begin to wonder if it's ok. The lack of an LCD screen begins to bother you when you find out you can't review your shots. Think about it: you wont review your pictures untill you get to the PC.Sorry I am very disappointed."
1,Waste of Money,"Bought one of these from Circuit City and returned it 3 days later. The SW freezes up - the clarity is terrible, and it uses four batteries per download. Sorry!"
1,Waste of Money,"This was my first digital camera, and I would suggest staying away from it, besides draining new batteries in a matter of minutes....... it didn't work right with the computer. We could never figure out how to work it, so ended up paying a bit more for a camera that works.... going into other websites many others have had the same promblem, in fact I haven't ever looked at a good review of this camera. Don't waste your time or money on this"
1,A good idea gone bad.,"Well my girlfriend got this as a prize in a contest and she let me try it. As you've read before the picture quality is unbelievable ungly... the colors are ""blended"" the picture looks pixelated and blurry, etc...You can have and idea of what to expect if you take a normal (and decent looking) 640x480 image and save it as JPG at the lowest quality available (I was able to do this with Photoshop). Again... don't buy this if you want to take good photos of memorable moments, if you try hard you can really make a use of this camera by dropping the image size to 50% and adjusting the colors, contrast, etc.Maybe a little kid would like it because you can look at the pictures on the TV but soon he'll wonder why his/her camera takes so horrible pictures and drop it forever.And that's not all... don't even get me started on the software and battery consumption of this baby monster you can read it in the other reviews, hope it clears all."
3,My digital camera review agfa smile camera,"This is a very good camera for someone who is just getting started with digital photography. I am very well satisfied with my pictures. However, close ups of items such as jewelry are not too good. But, for a small price for pictures of other things you can't go wrong."
1,100% crap,"Camera eats batteries like my dog eats treats. Serial port connection lasted about 3 days. The flimsy input inside the camera broke, and the camera no longer connects to a computer, thus rendering it utterly useless. The battery compartment snaps shut with a small extended piece of plastic on the door. That broke off and I have to hold the batteries in with a rubber band. The picture quality is very poor, unless of course you want to capture the essence of walleye photography. Whatever you do, stay away from this junk."
3,Buyer Beware,"This camera eats batteries...We finally purchased an AC adaptor at Radio Shack to use when we are downloading photos but it still goes through the batteries very quickly.This camera works best for outdoor pictures. Indoor pictures are either too dark or washed out if the flash is used.Also, although this camera is still being sold by many retailers, according to AGFA they are no longer producing or selling this camera and the software for it is unavailable."
1,Just awful; avoid at all costs,"I bought two of these for my kids and they are awful. The picture quality is so low that only about 10% of the photos are worth keeping. And being for my young children, my standards are very low. I bought them almost as a toy, and STILL I'm severely disappointed. DO NOT BUY."
2,Embroidery scissors only!,"This cannot handle any 4"" scissor, only an embroidery scissors (like the stork kind) that have a small flat screw. I need to keep a small scissors that can handle fabric as well as thread.Pretty, though."
3,Watch The Movie,"You always hear people say that the book was better than the movie, not so in this case. I enjoyed the book, don't get me wrong, but if you're only going to read the book or watch the movie, but not both, I'd say watch the movie."
4,"Excellent - met Terry from Ms. Olson, the blonde at Shadle","This probably won't go anywhere but I met you Terry when I was a Junior, wrestling for Shadle Park. I was at North Central High at a wrestling match when Ms. Olson came up and introduced you to myself and my good friend Brett. You told us about wrestling at Shadle, with I believe Lyle Pugh as your coach. Anyway if this makes it to you that will be great. I'm now 34 and still remember meeting you and I've watched your movie more than once. Thanks for putting ""Shadle"" on the map. DJ_Anderson@battelle.org"
2,If you loved the movie..don't buy this book!,"My husband is perhaps the biggest fan of the movie Vision Quest. He bought this book hoping it would be as good or better and was HORRIBLY disappointed. It was shallow and Godless! You are left feeling disconnected from the main character. You feel like you need a bath after reading it. Seriously, this is not the book you had hoped for if you loved the movie. Save your money on this one."
3,Software is miserable,"The Minolta 1500 Zoom takes excellent digital images. Several have been subsequently used by newspapers in this region. Downloading into my StarMax (Mac) however, is a test of a person's sanity. The software is straight forward enough but invariably stumbles during a save and goes back to the initial connection procedure over and over again. A real time waster!"
3,Different,"Jackson was very good, as usual, but the plot was pretty contrived. I found I was paying more attention to the sound track (which is outstanding) than the story line."
4,Black Snake Moan,"I'm a big fan of Christina Ricci and Samuel L Jackson, so despite or because of the soft porn material I found this movie very entertaining. Both stars do not disappoint in their roles and Justin Timberlake gives a believable performance as a wacky boyfriend. Since the ""Blues"" and hard luck love, sex in this case, seem to go hand in hand the mixture in this film seems like a good fit. Samuel L's guitar playing is a big suprise and overall the music is great."
4,Good...but not great,"This movie was good, but not great. It was a bit slow and nowhere near as good as Craig Brewer's previous film, Hustle & Flow. Yes, Black Snake Moan was a little slow. It had it's exciting parts. It had great performances from Samuel L. Jackson, possible his finest since Pulp Fiction, and also from Christina Ricci. This is definately worth buying."
3,"Alright film, but wouldn't go out of the way to see it.","This film follows the unfortunate life of an abused woman named Ray who winds up getting into a predicament, and gets dumped for dead on the road outside Lazareth's house. Lazareth is an old blues man who has had a string of bad luck love also. Finding her give his something new to care about, and a chance for redemtion in both of them. Overall, this movie is rough around the edges, at times a bit long on some storyline, to short on another. It is well rounded and has a beginning and an end, but just didn't do much for me. It is worth renting to see the hype, but not worth an investment."
1,"Don""t waste your time on this one!",I choose this because Samuel L. Jackson was in it. A major dissapointment. This movie was just plain stupid and the acting bad.
4,Good Movie,The movie has a lot of twist and turns. The actors and actresses did a great job on their roles.Good movie for those that like bizarre kind of movies
4,solid grit south saga,"Good plot, with solid acting and plenty of eye candy, just wish the ending was a bit less soft. Overall a good headscratcher"
3,Black Snake Moan OK,The movie was pretty good and sometimes erotic. I will probably watch it again but it is not particularly high on my list. It's OK.
3,Weird. I think.,"Every man has his price. As it turns out, mine is Christina Ricci, naked, and sexed up.This fact alone provided me the motivation to sit through one of the oddest flicks I have ever seen.Thats pretty much all I have to say about this flick."
2,goes nowhere,"Samuel L. Jackson & Christina Ricci do a great job, even Justin Timberlak gives a decent acting performance, but the film goes nowhere. needed moe of a story. worth watching just to see CRs twins."
2,Sad for CR and SLJ,"This movie was basically made to showcase Christina's body and SLJ's attemptto play the blues.The storyline fell to the wayside and JT's presence andlack of acting just added to the quagmire.I think CR and SLJ are great actors,I just hate they sullied themselveswith this movie."
3,Shuck & Jive from the maker of Hustle & Flow,"One can't help but feel like a disappointed sideshow customer at the end of Black Snake Moan. Instead of two hours of demented sleaze as promised by the publicity (Christina Ricci chained to a radiator in her underwear!), it's yet another Magic Negro movie, in which a wise, asexual black man solves the white folks' problems. Despite the naughty language and the blues music on the soundtrack, Black Snake Moan is an incredibly undaring movie, the kind you go to see with your parents in order to get out of the house on Thanksgiving weekend (especially since elderly PBS viewers are the only people left who still listen to the blues)."
4,Surprisingly Good,"Definitely quirky, sensual, resplendently religious and quite humorous. This makes for an interesting movie, to say the least, but very well done. The focus of the movie centers around the relationship between Christina Ricci and Samuel Jackson in some great dialogue. No cliche's here. They both deliver a great performance. Justin Timberlake didn't do too bad as the anxiety-ridden soldier boy.Nice to see Kim Richards back in game. It's been a long time since ""Escape to Witch Mountain."""
