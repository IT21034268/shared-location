5,Flowmaster Muffler,Excellent mufflers for my classic car. They have an awesome sound without alot of interior sound. Amazon was the best deal for price and shipping.
5,Great product,"Great product, very well made. It is a little different than the picture though. the handles on top are not like the rope as shown, they are just flat nylon. Perfect size for a day pack and very comfortable to carry."
2,"A dated source, other Italian publications available","This was and is a great starter into looking at Italian and Neapolitan uniforms. The uniform plates are nice, but there are more indepth period plates available. Unit histories are brief and the Neapolitans get little to no treatment and what is said is with a definite bias. Uniform plates at the museum of San Martino can be viewed for the Neapolitan plates. An Italian publication reprint of first hand artist sources from 1850s is available from Sugarco Milano. The Italian General Staff publishes a full color publication (but expensive) on the Cisalpine republic, Lombard legion etc. A cheaper publication is also available. Use the Osprey title as a starter. Osprey will do better to replace the title with a several part treatment."
4,Nice primer with great illustrations,"This is nice booklet on the Italian troops. Nevermind their battlefield performances, just admire the uniforms which are very nicely executed by Mike Chappell. That kettledrummer has to be seen to be fully appreciated. Murat had such great sartorial tastes!"
5,Awesome KB/Mouse Combo!,"It took me a long time to finally give a chance to a wireless mouse/kb combo simply due to the inferior response times of previous products. I can honestly say this duo works very, very well and works just as good as my MX510 mouse it replaced. The BT hub station is excellent too and makes this combo even more of a value. Highly recommended."
1,I'm sorry I bought this,"A lot is made in the product description about how the mouse and keyboard can communicate long distances to the hub at the computer, and do so accurately. Well, the communication is spotty at BEST. I have the receiver hub RIGHT NEXT to the keyboard and the mouse and their response often goes into fits where they are both totally unresponsive! It is amazing how useless a computer is when neither the mouse nor keyboard respond! At other times they are only slightly responsive. What a headache to use! Also, I can't figure out why this product is so expensive. You can buy a bluetooth hub for $30 and wireless mouse and keyboard for much less as well. I would recommend going that route. It can't be any worse than this."
1,Won't work with dell bluetooth card,"Bought this product and discovered (after hours with Logitech and Dell tech support) that the keyboard will only stay connected if you are using a Logitech Bluetooth hub.After discussions with Logitech, and telling them I would write this review, they asked me to point out that this problem will occur with any hub other than a Logitech hub, and that they have hammered Bluetooth to solve this compatabilty problem to no avail.So unless you want to spend 5 minutes reconnecting the keyboard every time you reboot , don't buy this."
1,"When it works, it works","I bought this keyboard because i have had good luck with logitech products. when this keyboard works, it's nice. i'm running under windows xp home sp2, and every other day or so i need to unplug the usb cable from the back of the computer to get the mouse or keyboard to work. this is after a cold boot. and also everytime i boot the connection wizard wants to restart my mouse. it's annoying, i also purchiced the microsoft product that goes for around the same, and installation was easy and haven't had any issues with the microsoft product. the Logitech on the other hand, i'll think twice before i buy another. I'm using the microsoft bluetooth keyboard to write this review."
2,Left a bad taste in our mouths,"My boyfriend and I are 20 and 19 respectively, which is probably right on for the audience this movie was targeting. While some parts were amusing enough to elicit a chuckle, the flow of the movie was very awkward, the jokes disgustingly predictable, and the screenplay definately left something to be desired. Ashton and Brittany were stellar actors that will probably wince later on at the sight of this movie on their résumés. While it is honest and to-the-point, it's certainly not a movie to rent and snuggle on the couch with, much less buy. Wait till it shows on HBO, guys, you're not missing much."
3,Just bought it as a Brittany memo.,"Just wanted it to remember Brittany by,For that it served it's purpose.May she rest in peace, she was a pretty girl."
4,A Great Chick Flick,"I saw this movie on the preview date, January 1st. I loved it! It was so cute it made me cry. It's the type of movie that lets you sit back, relax, and forget about your problems, well unless you've recently broken up with your boyfriend. I definitely suggest it if you like the kind of movie that overcomes hurdle after hurdle, with one thing going wrong after another. But if you're looking for a movie that makes you think, you should probably pass on this one. It's a completely feel good, sappy, girly movie. And I loved it. And it doesn't hurt that Ashton Kutcher makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside ;)"
4,Just Funny !!!!,"Every reason to not get married,followed by a reason to get married. I imagine this is what Ashton Kutcher's life is like with Bruce Willis being around."
4,If you have ever been in Love see this movie!,"I thought this movie was great!...very funny. It basically helps all the ones in love who are completly different see, that all you need is love and nothing else! Go see it"
1,THE WORST FILM EVER,"Fortunately I downloaded this movie instead of paying for it - I thought it would be a bit of lighthearted entertainment...HOWEVER.THIS MOVIE WAS SO BAD I WANTED TO TEAR IT OUT OF MY HARD DRIVE AND DEFECATE ON IT.Brittany Murphy gives a nauseating, simpering performance and the best that can be said about Ashton Kutcher is that he performs the role adequately, (bringing into consideration that no acting skills are needed for such an emotionless, contrived piece of soppy BS as this film was).The plot is stupid and unrealistic, although there are a few funny moments they IN NO WAY make up for the complete waste of time that the rest of the film is.IF YOU LIKE THIS FILM YOU HAVE A LUMP OF CHEESE WHERE YOUR BRAIN SHOULD BE.And a small lump of cheese at that."
3,Just Married Review,I thought that Just Married was a really good movie. I saw it for Brittany Murphy. I like her a lot... SHe is a really great actress... Anyway the movie was stupid in a way but i enjoyed it. It was a really funny and good movie. Especially when the bug was on Ashton. You should buy the DVD i know i will!! bye!!
4,"Great movie ,deserves great dvd release","OK,this movie was probably the best comedy in 2003,and i loved it,if you haven't watched it yet,hurry to the videostore right away.about the dvd,it has all the usual components,audio commentary with the main cast,theatrical trailer,deleted scenes,alll in all great dvd for a great movie.i give both the movie and the dvd release 4 stars out of five."
1,it stinks it stinks it stinksss...,"i just wrote that title cause it sounds funny, im not saying the movies good im just saying i dont normaly say it stinks. i say peace of crap. well i dont say crap either but i dont know if i can say s***, i dont want to get sued by Bush. this movie is a chick flick, only 2 chuckles."
4,This was a hilarious movie!,"I just saw this movie last weekend with two GUY friends and all three of us laughed throughout the entire movie. And for those of you who say that the previews give away the funniest parts of the movie, and give away the entire plot of the movie, I guess we saw different previews. Yes, there were a lot of previews that did give away SOME of the funny parts of the movie, but not all of it.I love this movie, and Ashton and Brittany are an awesome pair! GO SEE THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVEN'T YET!"
2,Didn't make it,"This is an unfunny comedy. Only a few sight gags will keep you awake. The story is about two young people who live together and then decide to marry, mostly for sex. They quickly learn that each has many imperfections and they fight during their honeymoon, here and in Europe. Sorry, but this is a turkey."
2,Blahh,"I personaly thought that this movie was not awsome , but it didn't hit rock bottom either. The reason that i didn't like it very much was because i hate it when people fight all the time. It makes me feel depressed. It had a happy ending, though"
2,Some Funny Moments...But Could Have Been Better,"There's not a lot to say about this movie that the other reviews didn't already say. Young couple meet...fall in love and go on a honeymoon from hell. This movie should have, and could have been so much better.The first half of it is too slow, and by the time it gets funny...it's almost over. There's some pretty hilarious parts that are worth a rental, but I wouldn't buy this movie."
4,Nice Movie,"First off, Brittany Murphy is so hot. man. but this movie isn't as good as i expected. it's not that funny. some parts i laughed but it coulda been funnier i guess. but i guess it's good that it wasn't in a way cause it made for a much better story. it's a movie everyone can enjoy. there's jokes that will make you laugh and then theres the love story. they work into each other well. check it out."
2,Started out good..but went downhill,"I have to admit right now that I am neither an Ashton Kutcher or a Brittany Murphy fan. So when I say this DVD on the shelf at the video store, I was skeptical. Then I remembered all the trailers I'd seen of the movie, and thought it would be pretty good. It started out OK. Then somewhere along the way, it stopped being OK. There are maybe one or two good parts in this entire movie. It was just plain bad the rest of the time."
3,A major let down,"I was very excited to see this movie. The first thing that bothered me was that they were looking back on what already had happened. The comedy was very dry and did not make me laugh one bit. The ending of the movie was very predictable, and all the parts that were almost funny were shown the in the trailer. Save yourself [the money] and rent before you but this movie"
3,A few laughs but where's the romance?,"Just Married starring Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy is somewhat enjoyable but it's not one of those movies you can watch time and time again. It's kinda hard to fathom the two stars used to date because their chemistry in front of the camera is pretty lacklaster. She had more chemistry with Ron Livingston in Little Black Book. There some funny moments, and it's interesting all the ways they can't consumate the marriage, surprises and distractions keeps delaying the inevitable. It's not a terrible film but nothing worthy of praise."
3,Cute and Funny...,"This film was very light hearted and sometimes funny....it was hilarious all of the things that the couple went through during their honeymoon, and it was sweet in the end that they decided to not let anything or anyone stand in the way of their love for eachother...very cute and something to watch when you just want to relax and have some fun."
3,Three and a half stars,"This movie starts off with such promise, but leaves you disappointed.Brittany Murphy is a daddy's little rich girl. Ashton Kutcher plays a working radio announcer. The two fall in love and rush their relationship, as many young people do, and get married thinking that the fairytale is going to last forever. But, the honeymoon is over before it even starts in this marriage. They go to Europe for their honeymoon, where everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Since they have never really had any real problems before, they don't know how to work them out together and start to get on eachothers nerves, then begin fighting. By the end of the honeymoon they are both ready for divorce.The movie definitely has funny moments, but is also predictable and sometimes stupid.It's worth a rental, but don't expect anything great."
3,Better than I expected,"I did not have high expectations for this movie--I just wanted laugh... while it was not an all-out comedy, it filled the time with a pretty decent movie--better than a lot of the romantic comedies I have seen lately. Both Kutcher and Murphy were cute, and awkward like newlyweds would be. They did try a little too hard at times (scenes of climbing out of the bathroom window to avoid a girl in the bar, chasing the ex-boyfriend with a fire-poker, etc. come to mind)but overall a pretty fun movie with a happy ending."
1,Anyone under 16 will enjoy this,"If you have the brain capacity of a squirrel, which most people who gave this more than 1 star. Then you will enjoy this horrible movie.There wasnt anything funny about this movie except when I handed my $5 to the guy at Hollywood video."
4,"Right Next to ""Fools Rush In""",Murphy and Kutcher play a couple who fall in love and eventually get married. This hilarious movie shows people who first meet on a whim and have expectations of a relationship based on romance alone. The couple arrived at the airport angry at one another in the beginning of the movie. Then it flashed back to when they first met and the meeting of family and friends. The honeymoon was even more funny. He was so not cultured as she was and nearly caused a hotel in French Alps to be on fire. Then they are off in Italy and that is where the relationship begins to falter. They soon realize that marriage may not be in the cards for them. But both of them have a lesson to learn when it comes to marriage and romance. This is an entertaining movie.
2,2 Stars instead of 1,I gave this video two stars instead of only 1 because of my own stupidity in buying it. The seller did a great job - it arrived quickly and safely. It's just the movie itself is too stupid for words. What was I thinking?!
4,fresh and hilarious,"So many romantic comedies dished out by hollywood have that recycled taste, but ""Just Married"" is different and fresh. Ashton and Brittany have great chemistry, this is one romantic comedy that you won't want to pass up. The movie is so hilarious, the cast works well together and Ashton is so funny. Sure the movie has its flaws, some jokes are [bad] and the movie does go a little too far at times, but hey nothing's ever perfect. I think that this movie has a great message overall, rather than give up when the going gets tough on their marriage, they work it out. See it today!"
3,"goofy, foolish fun","Hate to spoil anyones nice hopes for a side splitting comedy, or a lush romantic feel good movie, but this is neither of those, rather its caught somewhere between them. Two young people nearly ruin a perfect relationship by getting married and what should be the perfect honeymoon turns into one misadventure after another. The film lacks staying power, and the humor is lame. Consider it Gidget gets married to dufus.Some may like the film for its cuteness, but to me it was somewhat of a let down."
1,Movie smells worse than its bathroom gags,"Don't waste your time, not to mention money, on this stupid and pointless movie. I borrowed this from the library and still considered it a waste of money driving to the library. The movie is loaded with gags that we've all seen countless number of times in other movies. Not only are these tired cliches but they are poorly performed. What was the director thinking? Kutcher's character is a complete moron without any idiosyncratic quirk to endear him to the audience; he's just stupid without being funny. Murhpy's character is not much better. Watching them fight each other is like listening to fingernails on a blackboard. One only wishes that they were in the car when the old lady rams it off the cliff. What a turkey of a movie."
1,Nothing in this film to like,"The supporting cast of the movie largely consists of one-dimensional stereotypes (WASPs have silly pet names! Chinese poeple talk funny!) -- but, sadly, they're more amusing than the lead parts.Ashton Kutcher's Tom is an uncultured dimbulb -- but he makes up for that by being petulant, whiny, selfish, and short-tempered. His wife says that she loves him, but it's hard to understand why -- apart from a nice smile, he has nothing to recommend him.Most of the gags in the movie are third-rate retreads of other Americans-in-Europe movies (They have tiny cars! French people are snooty!). Amazingly, this is actually a worse entry to the genre than ""National Lampoon's European Vacation"".The best metaphor for the movie is the tiny car the couple drive when they arrive in Europe. It's slow-moving, underpowered, and you'll wish you hadn't rented it. (Oh, and it's not a place you'd like to be trapped with Ashton Kutcher)."
1,Save your money,This is probably the worst film I have seen this year. There is no romance and very little comedy it's pretty pointless. A rich bimbo falls in lust with an idiot.
2,"Not entirely bad, Not great either.","This film is bland. There are some funny parts, but some of the humor is low. The movie could have used more of a drive for the plot other than the love life of the two main characters. The movie can get really dull at parts. The film struggles to get you to laugh, and has to fight even harder it seems to get you to laugh again. The ending, is, well, you can guess what the ending will be. Overall, the film doesn't seem to move in any particular direction, so you might want to pass this one up."
3,"Murphy is great, Kutcher not so much","Just Marriedis like many other romantic comedies - a couple in love finds themselves running into problems with parents (Meet the Parents) or on their honeymoon or the days before the wedding (License to Wed).Just Marriedhas its moments, but it also isn't particularly original or exciting. I'd swear I saw this movie before because of the countless plot cliches, even though I know I haven't seen it. Brittany Murphy plays her part well with an emotional depth that belied her years (and makes viewers realize just how tragic it was that she passed away last year). Ashton Kutcher on the other hand seems too emotionally immature. I'm not sure if its character or the way he played him, but it just seemed overdone. Bottom line: if you like these types of cliche romantic comedies,Just Marrieddoes the job and does it well. But don't expect much more than that."
1,Just Ignore!!!!!!!!,"This movie has got to be one of the worst films I've seen in a long time!!!I love simple comedies revolving around nothing in particular, but this movie was bad. I didn't laugh once, or chuckled for that matter. Ashton Kutcher should just stick to the 70's show. I don't find him funny anywhere else (remember, Dude, Where's My Car??). Just Married lasted 1/2 hour in my DVD player before I pulled it out due to EXTREME boredom. If Kutcher wasn't such a big name, this film would've never been released otherwise.Avoid, even if you're just going to rent it!!!!"
4,A great laugh - funnier than I thought it would be!!,"I went and saw this tonight, thinking it would be a fun no brainer for an evening. While the plot is no mystery, the jokes and physical humor are really quite funny. I found myself laughing to tears a couple of times. It reminded me of the old Chevy Chase films with the physical comedy.It's not going to win any awards, but overall I enjoyed it!"
1,"The Worst ""Movie""(?) of the Year","Is this a comedy? No. Is this a movie? No. In fact, the only thing that makes you laught is when the actors try to play...Avoid this at all cost!"
1,No Stars....No Plot....No Point....,"Somewhere, at some time in the past, someone suggested, coached or inspired Ashton Kutcher to pursue an acting career. That person should be located, brought out into the public square... and flogged....One star because it's required for posting....and no soup..."
3,Cute but not great,"Murphy and Kutcher are cute in this movie, but not great. The movie is not that funny, without any feel funny scenes that will stick out. Good for a lazy night with nothing better to do."
1,a romantic comedy for 3 Stooges fans,"JUST MARRIED is a romantic comedy for fans of the Three Stooges. If you'd rather see two appealing actors with charisma fight, physically and verbally, for almost the duration of its running length, then I guess you'll enjoy this movie. Otherwise, seek a romantic comedy that actually enjoys watching two people act as-if they are in love. Your girlfriend might give yah some for it, afterwards."
2,Not that great....good for a view,"I wanted a great funny movie, but ended up with a so so written movie withbarely any laughs. It follows a predictable story and has a predictableending.Good for a view on a rainy day."
2,Horrible!!!!!!,"I just finished watching the movie and it is extremely predictable and the acting is crap. If you have the intelligence of a sponge, then this movie will be one of your favorites."
2,I can count the funny parts on one hand....,"Let me start off with this. I love Ashton Kutcher and Brittany Murphy, so I was looking forward to see this so much. I had seen the previews numerous times, and it looked like such a great movie. I was wrong...First off all, they ruined half of the movie by showing the funniest parts in the previews. So when those came along, I didn't even laugh. They also showed too much in the previews, like half the movie. Their honeymoon was boring, it was just about them looking for a place to stay mostly. I can't even make this review long because it would be to boring to explain it.Don't go see this unless you're absolutley desperate. I saw this after seeing Two Weeks Notice for the fourth time, and even at the fourth showing of TWN, I still laughed more than I did at Just Married.-emerikan."
5,Great Concealer,"I used this concealer for my wedding. it arrived just a couple of days before the wedding, so I didn't have a chance to try it out. I took the risk and applied it on my wedding day. It worked GREAT! It covered up all those little things that I don't want to have to remember in pictures for the rest of my life. It blended very nicely with my skin and looked very natural. Several of my friends commented on my makeup and I really think this concealer and other subtle foundation products that I used were the reason the makeup looked nice and lasted all night. I will use it whenever I have a special occassion or just when I want to cover up the bags and blotches."
2,Not for Sensitive Skin - Contains parabens,"Looks great. But after a few uses caused breakouts at usage sites. Also caused broken blood vessels where under-eye area meets regular skin. Sadly, the beauty doesn't last. I cannot recommend this to people who are sensitive to parabens. I threw out the remainder of the sample I received from Sephora."
3,Light coverage concealer,"This product is very creamy and provides light coverage. I find it is not enough if my dark circles are bad, but it works well when I have good days. I have not used it as foundation, but as I have combination skin, I suspect it would make my T-zone shine. Having said that, when I use this as concealer, it does not settle in the fine under-eye wrinkles, which is a great bonus."
5,Best Concealer,"Hands down the best concealer I have used. It is not too thick, so it spreads evenly. I use it for undereye darkness and redness around my face. It is almost like a foundation--- you can use it pretty much on any part of your face and it provides good coverage. I really don't like the heavy feeeling of makeup, and it doesnt feel like this I am wearing much of anything with Onebase. It does the trick... my skin is so much more even when I apply it!"
2,Disappointed,"I gave this a full year's try since a subscription was on sale for a mere $5This magazine felt like a special edition of Cosmo ""focusing"" on diet and exercise. Even worse, it was constantly full of misinformation, ill-supported arguments supposedly ""according to one source"" or ""according to research"" (which is never actually listed), vapid pieces about clothes and makeup and hair, and ad after ad after ad.I didn't feel like I gained anything about ""Health"" at all. I won't be renewing."
1,I expected some articles related to health,"I was very disappointed in this magazine. With a title like 'Health', I wasn't expecting the concentration of articles to be on how to find a budget outfit, drugstore make-up tips that are just another form of advertising, or sugary processed foods (but low in calorie - which I still wouldn't call healthy!). There were only occasional articles on food or workouts. Honestly, I couldn't believe the amount of articles that were targeted to buying clothes or following fashion - it was ridiculous. Next time I want something like this I could just pick up a copy of Glamour."
2,Auto-renewal. What?,"I never agree to auto renew, so when I saw the bank charge I was a little surprised. I did not receive a warning or anything to indicate I had been schedueled to auto-renew. I actually had to speak to an Amazon rep and have them note on my account that we never agree to auto renew because another subscription which had been expired for months, somehow been scheduled to auto-renew as well."
2,3-star,It's garbage. Full of adverts/commercials. Just a few health talk or discussion. This is not the Health magazine or journal of those days.
5,Great tips for healthy living,"Month in and month out, Health delivers an interesting variety of relevant articles for and about women. There's everything from tips for healthy living to diet plans to exercise routines to articles about health issues that affect women to product recommendations (health, beauty, fitness, etc.) to light recipes, and so much more! I love the fact that they tailor many of their recommendations by age group (usually 30s, 40s, and 50s). Many magazines have come and gone from my home, but Health has been a staple for several years."
4,Informative and fun!,"It's not the health newsletter from Harvard, but it's lots of good information presented in an entertaining way. There's nothing like a little boost in your enthusiasm to do the right thing with diet, exercise, beauty and other health issues.With Amazon's amazing discount, you really can't go wrong with this subscription. You deserve a little gift -- why not something that has the potential to get and keep you well?"
4,Good Read,I bought this magazine for my waiting room and found myself reading it in my office! A readable magazine that is chock full of articles on healthy living.
1,Where is the rest?!,"I paid for ONE YEAR! I got the first three magazines, and then they just stopped coming in the mail! Where is the rest?!"
2,Too many beauty ads.,"I will remind you again that I DID NOT auto renew this subscr;ption. Hopefully, this matter has been corrected, and I will not be charged. Woman's Day is the other magazine that I DID NOT autorenew. I do not automatically renew my subscriptions through Amazon, and both of these magazines I did not want to renew. I hope this mistake does not happen again!!"
3,"Eh, it was cool at first",I liked this magazine at first but now it is not that interesting. It's one of those that are good to buy when you want to read about the person on the cover. otherwise it's not that interesting to me. I think I will cancel soon.
3,"Great offer, slow shipping.","I know that the magazine will be great if and when it begins to ship. Ordered in December and may not receive until March. Loved the price, but would have enjoyed receiving the magazine sooner."
4,Great for casual reading...,"I have been reading Health off and on since I was in high school in the late 1980s, and overall I love this magazine! The articles are usually rather interesting, and there is always at least one long article that I find relevant to my life or curiosities.However, there are times when the topics/articles border on resembling Cosmo and Glamour rather than really being related to health.Overall, I recommend Health as a great read for entertainment purposes and a great reference for health-related issues, but don't always expect nobel prize winning research data in every article."
4,Health,Lots of healthy tips and great ideas as well. It has good feature articles and information about things like knees.I enjoy the recipes also. It is very reasonably priced.
1,Have Yet to Recieve an Issue,"Probably a great magazine, however, I have yet to recieve a issue since ordering via this service in 2002.(I ordered in late Dec 2002)Just an FYI. Maybe I am the exception."
1,Haven't Received Yet but Check Cleared,I have yet to receive this mag but the check cleared the next day. Prolly takes a while... a loooong while.
1,No Show,It's been 7 weeks and I still haven't gotten the first issue of my subscription. What's going on Amazon? You weren't slow in billing me.
1,Health Magazine Review,I am a little dissatisfied because I still have not received my product. Hopefully it will arrive soon!
3,AT FIRST THE MAGAZINE WAS GOOD...,For the past couple of months have recieve requests to renew subscription before it exactly expires and give them more of money. Thank you.
2,Reenie,"I was surprised that this mag. was full of ads by prescription companies. Having gone the traditional medicine route for most of my life and finding that alternative medicine was safer, (when you know which to use) I was turned off by this one. If you don't mind traditional medicine read on, but it's just not for me."
1,I never get my magazine!,I just got only one issue so far. I don't think they send it on time. I subscribed from September and I got only one issue. What's wrong with this system. so annoying
1,have not as yet received this,I have not as yet received this and should have last week. My sister and I both signed up at the same time and she has had her copy over a week and it is on the newstands; so please extend my subscription by l month. Thank you. at
5,Health Magazine has something for everyone...,"My entire family enjoys reading HEALTH magazine. It has recipes, exercises, articles, and more. I would highly recommend this magazine for anyone interested in fitness."
4,The Icing On The Cake.,"This has to be the most under-rated Talking Heads album. Their final studio album, it sees the band return to the effortless grooves and neurotic worldview that marked their first 5 albums. This album has grown on me over the years. Today it sounds years ahead of it's time and delights those younger members of my family who take the time to explore it. The inclusion of Sax & Violins is the icing on the cake. Possibly their best song ever. One can only wonder what work is hidden on the shelves from that session yet to see the light of day."
5,Excellent book,The book provides a very thorough overview of sparrow identification and suitable for birders who are interested in getting into the details.
5,Beyond the Newspaper Story,"As a news junkie, I especially enjoyed this type of book. It takes you where the newspapers left off - or would not go. For those with a social conscience, it is disturbing and may engender feelings of injustice. The stories illustrate a lack of accountability by public officials, particularly law enforcement. It makes one wonder if this stuff goes on elsewhere, not just Orange County California. A good read!"
5,Great Volcanoe Book,This is a great book for everyone interested in volcanoes. It is very readable and talks not only about the science but also how the researchers do the science - with some very charming stories. It is really amazing that all chapters are written by female experts. We hear a lot about the lack of women scientists but there seems to be no lack of women studying volcanoes! A great book to give as a gift to a high school or college age daughter or niece.
3,eBook sample doesn't even make it to Chapter 1 making it useless,The eBook sample does not even make it past the list of illustrations making it useless in deciding if the potential reader wants to spend >$100 for it.
5,Slammin,This cd has to be one of the best cds of this year. Tank and the new Gerald Levert are the cds ya have to get for Christmas.
3,it was alright,"this is an ok cd way better than the first, but im still looking for more. tank is sexy and he has a good voice, but his music could be alot better, i really hope he can have a successful career because there is just something i really like about him. but he just seems to have those one or two strong songs and the rest of the cd is ok which is a step up from his 1st one which had one great song (maybe i deserve) and the rest was not good at all."
2,Definitely Nothing Special,"I didn't actually buy this CD and I'm glad I didn't. I copied it from a friend. The thing I don't understand is that I never was a fan of Tank's voice from the beginning, so I don't know why I thought I could bear this CD. There is something about Tank's voice that annoys me. He sounds extremely monotone to me, which is evident on the first single ""One Man."" He always sounds like he is afraid to let loose and have fun with his voice. He always sounds restrained. That's the reason why I wasn't fully able to enjoy this CD or anything that Tank has released in the past. Another bad thing about this CD is the wannabe ""r&b thug"" -ishness that CD takes on after about the 10th track. ""Let Me Live"" and ""Party Like a Thug"" sound like R. Kelly reject songs. I'm so tired of all the ""bling bling"" in today's hip hop and r&b? Can anyone tell me exactly when r&b left the voice and the heart and went to the mall?"
5,A wonderful account of life during the Norman conquest,"Red Lion and Gold Dragon by Rosemary Sprague is a well-written, warm account of life growing up during the Norman Conquest for young readers. It is the story of Aelfred Ansculf, an young Englishman who had everything until his baron father married a Norman. From that point on, everything will change for this young heir.Throughout this book, Aelfred will lose nearly everything, but in the end, he comes to know the true meaning of sacrafice and true love"
4,A solid Southwestern mystery,"Kevin Kerney, once a well-regarded police detective, has retired from police after a serious injury. Now, he works a seasonal ranger saving up for his dream-buying and running a small ranch.However, his investigating days are far from over. A series of big-game poaching put him in conflict with more senior Park Service staff, until a murder of a Mexican tourist take precedence in the investigation.This is a colorful mystery, full of likable characters and the New Mexican nature; with the taste of conflict between ranching and environmentalism, as well as old greed; and even some unobtrusive romance.Kerney and his friends are well-described, although the villains are rather shallow. The old mysteries are somewhat predictable, but the investigation holds much suspense and danger.The resolution is satisfying, and the only (minor) flaw one finds in this enjoyable book is the switching between multiple viewpoints.--inotherworlds.com"
4,McGarrity one of the best new authors on the market today,"""Mexican Hat"" is a fast paced whodunnit set in the State of New Mexico. Very interesting storyline and characters with a modern day twist. It is obvious that Mr. McGarrity is very knowledgeable in the field of Policeinterrogation procedures as well as the political interfacing of his home state police departments.Very enjoyable story with believeable characters, warmth, emotion and just the right amount of romance.This novel prompted me to purchase his first novel, ""Tularosa"". I am truly disappointed that I did notknow of the first novel prior to the second.Thanks to the one chapter review of the Houston Chronicle Interactive web siteled me to ""Mexican Hat"".I am looking forward to McGarrity's third novel."
4,Best of Kevin Kerney novels.,"A very good mystery. Excellent view of So. New Mexico ranch country. Characters you care about, and a good plot that jibes with the area's history. Good development. Hard cover edition well produced and designed. Well worth reading."
5,Mexican Hat,This is another fast moving book by M.McGarrity. It kept me interested and not wanting to put the book down! Good story from the beginning to the end.
2,not as good as the first Kevin Kerney novel actually,"I liked the first Kevin Kerney novel much better. This one seemed almost the same, but, since I had read the first one, it became boring."
5,Great movie,Wonderful! I love this movie and recently visited Europe! It was comical with actual historical sights! Just wonderful all the way around!
1,Not good family or any other kind of entertainment,"It's hard to know where to start. I endured 1 hour 45 minutes of this movie when my wife said ""I hate this movie; it's the worst I have seen"". I completely agree.It is not funny, not entertaining and not interesting. I really don't understand why anyone would rate it 5 stars.I like Fred MacMurray and Jane Wyman, but this movie is a total bust. There isn't a humorous scene in it. It's not good family entertainment because there is adult drinking throughout the movie which is completely out of character for Mr. MacMurray's movies.It just goes to prove that no matter how talented you are, you can't be a winner every time. I will continue to search for movies with Fred MacMurray and Jane Wyman because I like their movies, but this one is definitely *not* recommended."
1,Not Fred's Best,"I usually love movies starring Fred MacMurray, but this is an exception. The plot is very slow to develop and did not hold our family's attention very well. BON VOYAGE was surprising because most of our dvds with Fred MacMurray are our very favorites (Follow Me, Boys; Absent-Minded Professor, etc.) I ended up donating this one to a local charity."
3,3 stars,"Three Bedrooms, One Corpse is a mystery about someone who's killing women in for-sale houses.It was an intriguing mystery, and I liked the premise. And there was a romance, which might have added depth, but the romance was pretty inexplicable--the 30-year-old heroine sees a guy with white hair and immediately has the hots for him.My biggest problem, though, was the tone of the story. It felt like the first-person narrator was on valium or something, or that she was bored by the story. There was a distinct lack of feeling, even in dangerous or romantic scenes."
4,Another cozy Southern mystery by Charlaine Harris,"This is my second mystery by this author in this series and I liked it as well as the first. Harris does a great job of making you feel like you're right there in this small town in Georgia (I think Lawrenceton was modeled after Covington). Detective-character Roe Teagarden, formerly a librarian, is now a lady of leisure, since she unexpectedly inherited quite a bit of money. She's looking around trying to find herself, and is trying out being a real estate agent in her mother's firm. Just as she's deciding this is really not for her, she discovers a body in a house that she's showing. When another body is found in an empty house, people begin to wonder if someone is going around killing real estate agents.The plotting was good and I was a bit surprised at the killer. But mostly I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere of this small town and interesting inhabitants."
4,Real estate leads to real crime,"In this 3rd. book of the series, Aurora Teagarden has quit her job as a librarian and decides to try her hand at her mother's real estate business. In the very first house she goes to with a client, she discovers a dead body. The deceased is a rival real estate agent who was reputed to have numerous extra-marital affairs. There are many suspects--jealous husband, rival realtors, spurned lovers, but Roe is the one who uses an obscure clue to track down the murderer. Also in this book, she meets and falls in love with Martin Bartell, a wealthy older man who is the manager of a large company. His attraction to Roe seems unlikely, but their relationship proceeds very rapidly, if unbelievably throughout this book."
3,Charlene Harris is fun to read,"I started reading the Charlene Harris Sookie Stackhous series and totally enjoyed her style of writing. So I decided to try another one of her series. So far out of the Aurora Teagarden series, Three Bedrooms, One Corpse is my favorite. This series is something a parent could have a 12 to 13 year old read with out worring about the content.I find her books funny, relaxing and easy to read."
4,Good easy read,"A great book for the beach or vacation, perhaps even for a long soak in the tub. The writing requires no extra brain power and the main character, Roe, is an interesting person. It tickled me the way Roe was such a mystery book fanatic. She seems to have books scatered throughout her house, as well as her purse. Whipping out a paperback even if she was only standing in line at the checkout counter. The story was short, the action moved quickly, but the who-done-it was extremely easy to predict."
3,good but not as good as the previous Aurora Teagarden mysteries,"I was a little disappointed in this Aurora Teagarden mystery. Little time was spent on the actual mystery because most of the story centered on Aurora's love life. It was nice to see the main character ""fleshed out"" a bit more, but not at the expense of time spent on the mystery.I look forward to reading the next book in the series and hope it will be on par with the first two."
3,This series is just bland,"This is my least favorite series by Harris. I started out trying to give Roe a chance, but at this point I'm only still reading them because they've got to get better or the series would have ended by now. For a character that's supposed to be intelligent, Roe just isn't. Her love life is too ridiculous to care about, and you're not given enough information about the secondary characters to even wonder who the bad guy is. It's not to say the stories aren't mildly entertaining, but the revelations are so anticlimactic that if the books were any longer it just wouldn't be worth the time it took to get through them."
4,THIRD IN SERIES,"A better than average cozy mystery series: Aurora Teagarden Mysteries. This is the third in the series. Aurora (Roe for short) is assisting her mother in the real estate office. Upon unlocking a home for Martin Bartell and his sister - they discover a ""dead realtor"" in the upstairs bedroom. Roe is very attracted to Martin and he seems to like her alot, too. Of course, Roe is trying to uncover who committed the murderer. Good Fast Read."
2,Disappointed,"I normally think that Charlaine Harris is golden, I love the Southern Vampires, Haper Conolly, and Lily Bard series but this one falls flat. I'm not sure what it is about it, but I just don't like it."
3,The flowery style impeded comprehension (for me),"I usually like reading this sort of channelled material, and I gave this book a good try, but couldn't get through it.The book was channelled from the Arcturians, fifth and sixth dimensional beings of light from the Arcturian star system. The language is flowery and poetic, a bit too much so. I found comprehension to be hindered by this style.I didn't get anything out of this book at all, though I might have done had I been able to persevere with it. Its content looked promising - I just couldn't get past the style."
4,Vickie Britton writes in the old gothic style I love!,"Have you ever read a book and kept saying, 'Don't open that door' but the heroine does anyway. Well, this is the way I felt when I read this book. Anna came home because her adopted uncle was dying. She had no way of knowing that he'd leave The Devil's Gate, his ranch to her. Now it seems as if everyone wants to get rid of Anna. Who should she trust? This book is a must read!"
4,Good Read,"The Devil's Gate Vickie Britton New Concepts Publishing - Feb. 2000 ISBN 1586080172 DisketteAnna has been away at the University of Reno when she gets the call that the man who raised her is dying so she returns to The Devils Gate ranch. Not long after she arrives Tavas dies leaving Anna the ranch and all of its problems. Mysterious cattle mutilations cause rumors of witchcraft. Then Ivan's wife is found dead at the bottom of the canyon, and it looks like the work of The Cult of Akkera.There are many characters involved, but I had no problem following along, the plot is excellent and keeps you guessing until the end; A very well written mystery.The author, Vickie Britton, often co-authors with her sister Loretta Jackson; On her own, Vickie likes to explore the darker side of romance, and she has written three romantic suspense stories as well as penning the occasional vampire tale.Pam Stone"
2,Disappointing. Very short. very few pictures.,"Very diappointed. I got a nice Kandinsky book, hardback, with about 40 prints. This book was $7.00 and had very little material. Worth about $.50."
3,Nothing special,"Having stumbled on to Beauman's book, The Sisters Mortland, and loved it, I immediately bought several other Sally Beauman titles. Lovers and Liars is the second I read. I was disappointed by it. It was not as profound as I hoped. It was not as beautifully written as I hoped. The characters were not as compelling as I hoped. It is much more of a traditional thriller/romance than one might expect having read The Sisters Mortland first. If a standard thriller/romance is what you are looking for, Lovers and Liars will do just fine. If you are looking for artful literature, Lovers and Liars may not be the right choice."
3,Too Contrived,Well written and fast moving thriller but much too contrived for my taste. The misdirection that provides for the plot twists and confusion on the part of the heroine as to the real villains is much too unbelievable. In this respect it reminds me of the Magus by Fowles which I loved in my twenties but upon revisiting decades later found unbelievably silly.
3,Little Girl Loves Dogs,I got this magazine for my little girl - she loves dogs and goes wild everytime she see's one. This Magazine was perfect for here since it is a lot of photo of differnt types of dogs.(I do think you would have to be a big dog lover to enjoy this magazine - since I find it intresting but not exciting - but my little girl likes it and that is all that matters).
5,Fun Magazine,"I have always enjoyed reading this magazine. It gives you little tidbits of new science findings, a training trick, highlights of three dogs, and many other fun articles. I have learned many intersting things about our canines and always look forward to getting the next magazine to learn something else I didn't realize!"
4,Dog Lovers,I just started receiving this magazine and find it very interesting. I have owned a Austrialian Terrier for five years and the article on that bread of dog was right on! I would encourage anyone owning a dog or thinking of buying a dog to read this magazine first for tips and answers!
4,Magazine Review,"I bought this as a gift for a friend who raises German Shepherds. She was quite thrilled to receive this as a gift, and seems most satisfied with it. Good gift, at a really good price."
4,Why i Love Dog Fancy,"I have read "" Dog Fancy "" for nerly eight years. It is insightful, has alot of great articals on K-9 care from puppyhood to old age..It is also a good resurse for owners of or people looking for pure bred dogs, However i wish they did more articals and gave more exposure to the "" ALL AMERICAN DOG MIXED BREED.""Dog Fancy also offers a monthly section where you can read answers to question asked to the vet. Of your looking for to possibly adopt a pure bred dog it's a good first stop for information before selecting, adopting and bringing home you new puppy or dog.."
4,Dog Fancy,I enjoy reading Dog Fancy as the articles are short and of interest to everyday pet owners. I also love the pictures and targeted breeds that are featured each month.
1,Dont Buy... I made Purchase On August I still got my Magazine yet.,i purchase a subcription for Dog Fancy in August according to Amazon I will get my first copy on Octuber>> However Nothing was ship out and when you call them you can never get hold of nobaby.. If u want to buy a magazine subcription buy from Postal Service because they are more reliable than Amazon....
2,ads and more ads,"I Not to happy with the Fancey, Nothing but ads and breeder info! HOWEVER I do enjoy the fact that readers get a chance to enter there dog in the mag...... but thats about it! nothing exciting, nothing new and definiatly nothing fancey."
5,Explanitory and great,"This magizine is wonderful, and I was very pleased with how it had many explanitory issues. I learned alot and it will help me study for my future career in zoology and animal behavior. I incurage young readers to buy an annual subscription to this magagzine."
1,Disappointing,"Although there are a few articles in this magazine that I enjoy reading, at least 4 pages are devoted to breeders trying to sell puppies! As a dog lover, I fully believe in making adoption your first option and all those puppy mills out there aren't helping with the unwanted pet population. I will not re-subscribe to this magazine."
2,Overzealous Start Up Subscription,"While I did get my start up magazine prior to 6 weeks, I got 3 in a row in less than a week. A month's prior, that month and then the next month. Guess they want my subscription to be over with soon."
1,Very poor quality magazine,"Don't waste your money on this magazine. It is 60-70 advertisements, and the articles are not very informative. It might be appropriate for children, but not adults that are serious about educating themselves about dogs."
3,.....well...,Too many ads. The ads take up about half of the magazine! The articles need more detail. One suggestion is to add more articles and less ads (obviously). I'm thinking of not renewing my subscription to this.
5,DOG FANCY ROCKS!,I HAVE HAD A SUBSCRIPT TO DOG FANCY FOR MANY MANY YEARS! I LOVE THIS MAGAZINE! SEEING ALL THE DOGGERS AND GETTING A POSTER TO BOOT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR ALL DOG LOVERS!
3,Dog Fancy review,I enjoy reading Dog Fancy for its variety of topics and focus on specific breeds as well as mixed breeds. I am the proud owner of a very sweet labradoodle who does work as a therapy dog. I have read several articles on this topic which have enlightened many animal owners as to the important role therapy dogs play in people's lives. It is my hope that more readers of your magazine will volunteer their time with their dogs to help people.
1,check out Dog and Kennel,"this magazine is not at all what i expected. if you want the most for your money, check out dog and kennel magazine."
4,Plesantly Surprized!,"My mom used to subscribe to this magazine when I was growing up. I used to read it often throughout my adolesence. However I always found the magazine to be lacking. (Quality, Information.) Now some 10 years later I decided to try the magazine out once again. Since there has been some recent hype going around about it. I got this months newsstand -- April -- issue and the Special Puppy issue. I am in Love! It seems the Dog Fancy has improved by leaps and bounds since my last read. Now it contains an enormous ammount of extremely helpful information as well as stories and such to entertain you."
4,Great Magazine,[[ASIN/t:B00005NINS Dog Fancy (1-year)]] This was a renewal I have an older puppy and This magazine has been the most helpful of all the magazines
3,RD be aware,"I gave this book a 3 start because it is filled with relevant information regarding LTC nutritional standards of care. However, if you are buying this book to get CEP, as someone wrote under another review, be aware that the book does not include the test or the option to reclaim CPEs. I guess one had to buy a separate test from another website that selll just the test for more money that the book itself!"
2,not as described,"item is okay, except you cannot sync the Treo with computer, even tho its description in Amazon and the box both state that you can. Device will recharge Treo, but will not sync."
2,Charger Failed and wiped out all my data!,"I love the concept: one device for car or hotel room. I used the travel charger regularly for seven-months. The product worked fine with the exception that it does not sync as advertised.Without warning the charger would not fit easily into the entry port. When I attempted to reseat the charger, it apparently shorted the system, and erased all my data. Most frustrating, requiring several wasted hours with the techies at Verizon.Just ordered a Palm car charger as a replacement. Now I need to lug two separate charger for travel."
1,"Terrible, it crashed my palm","This thing crashed my palm treo! and of course as it is not original or palm approved, the warranty does not cover for this."
3,"Excellent Primary Source Material, but Flawed","As another reviewer mentions, Ray proof texts the Patristic Sources in the same way Protestants proof text Scripture.However, it does contain much material that sheds some light on early church thought/history that many Christians are unaware of. Hopefully, one will gain an appreciation of the entirety of Tradition that is taken for granted (in terms of theology) by modern day Christians, even if the conclusion as presented in this book is incorrect."
5,Awestruck...,"After reading opinions by James White and William Webster on the same subject, I thought I'd been given the full truth. But Mr. Ray's further, deeper development on White's/Webster's study showed me that I had only been given an incomplete story. What else about the Protestant faith is only ""partially"" developed ? Mr. Ray's presentation is overwhelming. One particular nugget in the goldmine of truth was not detailed in the New Testament, Old Testament, or the Church Fathers. It was a geography lesson on Caesarea Philllipi. It had never dawned on me what a long journey this was for Jesus and his disciples. The significance of the journey and the rock have come into focus!I am now dedicating myself to learning what other partial truths have been developed fully by the catholic church."
5,Good Apologetics Resource,"If you can manage to battle your way through the format of this book (%10 text and %90 footnotes) it is a great book to have in your library. It is not a reason-based approach to the issue of the primacy of Rome in the early Church as it is an overwhelming number of references and citations. The argument relies mostly on historical proof, however, it can get a bit tedious at times.As a soon-to-be Catholic I think this book erased any questions in my mind about how the early Church regarded Rome and it is a nail in the coffin of independent congregationalist fundamentalists.It is a great reference book which could be used by armchair apologists, if you are into that sort of thing. But it will require a bit of discipline to finish this book."
3,"Interesting subject, dry writing and occasional incorrect facts.","The information in the book is good. The first-hand accounts were interesting to read. There were some incorrect historic and geographic facts. One of them was a reference to the land opening in Oklahoma as the ""Cherokee-Arapahoe lands."" It was Cheyenne, not Cherokee. Another were multiple comments that inferred Waynoka, Oklahoma was in the Panhandle, it is 60 miles east of there. The last example was that Lamy, New Mexico is east of Santa Fe. It isn't, it's south of Santa Fe."
5,THE BEST documentary about the SF Quake and Fire***,"The first time I watched this, I was astounded at how deeply moved I was for the people and the city of San Francisco. This documentary cuts right to the heart of where the people lived, and what it was like to have your world wiped out in a matter of minutes. The camera work, editing, writing and music are superb. Thankfully director Ken Joy had the good taste to bypass the melodramatics of the politic hijinx in the city, and instead create a film that captures the pathos of the plight of a city where two-thirds of it's citizens are suddenly homeless and destitute. This is a MUST-SEE, and MUST-OWN title if you're interested in the best documentation of this horrible calamity. I'm a collector of all things ""SF quake"" and this is one of my favorite items in this collection. I've watched it six or seven times now."
3,"Average debut from an average ""Goth"" band.","Having heard all three of their collective recordings, I can say with all certainty that this group; regardless of the hype, is average. From the hypnotic, confusing, sleep inducing opener ""Revenge"" to the very end of this opus, it repels more than it attracts. There really aren't any erudite or poignant messages to convey lyrically. So, you have to try to enjoy ""Selected scenes from the end"" solely on the strength of their music. And that wasn't enough to garner any enjoyment out of this album. They have improved immensely over the years though."
1,Who would waste their money?!,"This is truly the low-water mark of the so-called Goth Music phenomenon. The members of this band are as lacking in taste as they are in talent. If you have any self-respect whatsoever, you will click the 'reverse' button on your browser and pretend that you weren't even interested in buying this. Don't misunderstand me; I'm not against goth music. In fact I rather like some of it; the genre, when executed (pardon the pun) competently, can either lift your spirits into a frenzy of bloodlust or plunge them along the razor edges of miasmatic dispair. About the only reaction you're likely to receive from LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT is an allergic rash. If you're interested in goth music, go for the classics: The Cure, Concrete Blonde, Dead Can Dance. Or if you like newer stuff, try the early albums of The Cranes. But stay away from anything on the CLEOPATRA label, and say no to juvenile meely-mouthed productions like LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT."
5,Fantastic band and musicians,"I just HAD to add my 2 cents; London After Midnight shines on this recording, the music is violent to romantic, the lyrics painting moods. Quite well done considering this was recorded when the band was only 2 years old, I believe. It is what started a phenominon launching LAM to underground greatness in the goth scene that continues to this day. An essential addition to your collection. And if I might add, not at all what you would think of as Goth, that is a term that doesn't fit in the least. They have their own sound, and calling them Goth is an injustice IMO."
1,Beware of this product,"This product has NO SUPPORT, and Microtek will not answer E-mail or online product support requests. The drivers bundled and shipped with the product are abysmal. Before buying check out the numerous sites with endless users complaining about their ""useless paperweights"". But, then what do you expect from a company that has been transferred from one owner to another repeatedly the last few years, and according to the Milwaukee Business Journal has been whittled down to only 17 employees."
1,It does not work on Mac OSX 10.3,"The latest version 7.16 Scan Wizardry does not work.They say it is compatible with OSX 10.3.However, G5, Powerbook G4 12"", I-Mac G4 running 10.3 had crashed at the start up of the program.Customer support will charge you $30 per every 30min. if you call to them.Do not buy it. Do not waste money."
3,Nice scans and options.... but...,"It scans normal pictures beautifully and quicker than my old scanner. The buttons are convenient and easy to use, as is the included software. My only two gripes are that the scanner glass had a few white flecks on the INSIDE of the glass (and no way to clean them off), and the fact that images scanned with the film scanner look faded and overexposed."
3,Trial by Fire NOT scorching!,"While presenting a positive Christian message throughout, Blackstock's Trial by Fire felt slow and repetitious. So the female protagonist drank and slept around. How many times does she have to regret that and feel unworthy? And if the male protagonist claimed ownership of ""his"" church one more time, I thought I might toss the book across the room."
3,Still trying to figure out if I like it...,"While I consider this average reading, especially with it's predictability factor...I have still found myself finishing the series. Obviously something draws me back to it. I do like TB's afterword thoughts and appreciate her faith, but as for being a challenging and mysterious read with turns and twists, none of this they are...But, still must support the effort..."
5,Cannot stop reading Terri Blackstock books,"Keep the books coming, Terri. She holds your attention so vividly that you want to read that next page and next chapter. I'm reading all of her books and this series is awesome. If you aren't fortunate enough to have read each series in order, it's not a problem because Terri Blackstock reintroduces certain characters or events very well. I love the way she weaves faith issues into her works. Love this book!"
5,The Seceret of the Unicorn Queen Series!,I LOVe this series. I have like the first 3 or 4 books. I know there are like a dozen of them or so but I could NEVER find the rest of the books ever anywhere! Crazy stuff. STINKS now they're all outta print!
1,Rather somber,Eggar's music is slow and somber. Either the piano or the recording resonates in a way that causes the piano to lack clarity and crispness. All the tunes left me feeling like a dark rainy day after some tradgedy. The slow tempo and sustained tones dying out to silence cause me to jump at the next chord. In contrast I find Michael Jones to be soothing - it keeps my interest constant and when I'm focused on the music I can forget other things and relax.
1,Not Satisfied,Not satisfied - Product Name is Catering Scoop #20 (professional size). We ordered two of them. What we received was two of the professional size Catering Scoop #24 (24 is stamped on the scoop)- they are smaller than our other #20's. We are not happy with the product - it was not what we ordered and paid for.
2,"Please Gunfighter, shoot me. Ugh.","Having seen almost all of Christopher Coppola's movies (even the uncredited ""Clockmaker""), I can say I would be considered the closest thing to a fan he has. That being said, this movie is torture. Even with the addition of Martin Sheen (the Sheens must owe Christopher a favor, Charlie appeared in his masterpiece ""Deadfall""), and finally a speaking role for Christopher Coppola staple Billy Floyd, this movie is dreadfully bad. Watching this movie, a friend and I cried out to the heavens begging for mercy, and another friend left rather than finish watching it. However, if you do foolishly decide to endure this trial, do not give up. At the end of the movie, Robert Carradine delivers the most unbelievable look, outside of a beer commercial, ever captured on film. It's like the punchline to 90 minute joke. The bad thing is, the joke's on you."
3,It's not so bad....,"Ok, Yes, it's a little 'cheesy'. Kinda reminds you of the Roy Rogers days, but it's a cute film. Chris (Hopalong) is my cousin, and I'll admit I just wanted to see it because he was in it. He reminds me of a young Lee Majors. It was great to see him on my TV screen in something other than the rodeo (like back in the 80's). I enjoyed every minute of it!"
3,Hopalong Cassidy portrayed as he was in Clarence Mulford's books.,"This movie may not have been the best western I've seen,but it wasn't the worst.They could have left out Martin Sheen & Robert Carradine.Hopalong was more like the character created by Clarence Mulford & not William Boyd's portrayal of him.I'm not saying anything bad about Boyd's portrayal.I have several of his Cassidy movies on DVD,& I enjoy his laugh.He portrayed him as a non-drinker,none-smoker(helped him in real life),but Mulford's Cassidy drank,smoked & was a little wild.He was in his 20's.red hair,medium height.I approached it with an open mind.It was entertaining & fast moving.I'll watch it again.If you never read Mulford's book's,read them so you can maybe appreciate the movie."
3,Kiss does heavy metal,"This is Kiss' ""heaviest"" album. This and Animalize I think are their ""most metal"" albums. With the additions of Vinnie Vincent and Eric Carr, Kiss found renewed energy and it shows. I'll always like the original lineup with Ace and Peter the best, but Vinnie to me was the best post-Ace guitarist they ever had. This album has more in-your-face production, with booming drums and ultra-distorted guitars. Standout tracks: Creatures of the Night, Danger, I Love It Loud, I Still Love You, Killer, War Machine."
3,Not a real classic,"I'm a fan of everything till Love Gun. I'm also a big fan of The Elder. I will admit that this album is quite heavy though the glossy production doesn't serve it too well. My idea of heavy is muddy Sabbath like production, not pop Pyromania like production. I liked the Jigoku treatment given to I love it loud.It's not my idea of a real memorable Kiss album, but it's got quite a few good tunes. Keep me coming is my favourite."
2,"The BEST cover EVER, but 1 of my least favorites from KISS","Aside from the cover being my favorite KISS album cover EVER, Creatures of the Night is 1 of my least favorites from KISS. Don't get me wrong, the title track is a great opener and it definitely ROCKS! But the high points for me are ""I Love it Loud"" ""I Still Love You"" & my favorite from Creatures ""Killer""Even though I only give Creatures 2 stars, I still recommend it."
1,ATTENTION: ACE IS NOT ON THIS ALBUM!!!!!,"I am a huge classic (original lineup) KISS fan. However, this album fails in comparison to the other previous gems. As a kid and as an adult when I updated my collection to cd I thought Ace was on this album. But when I read the liner notes and part of the KISSTORY book I found out Ace had nothing to do with these sessions!!!!What a scam to consumers and fans to put Ace on the cover and in the ""Love it Loud"" video in the 80s when he wasn't even a part of it!!!!! False advertising!!!!!Don't waste your time or money with this album!!! Not worth it!!!!"
4,Strong hard rock album,"The sheer amount of heaviness and the quality of composition of this album easily turn it into one of the best studio albuns of the KISS catalogue. I enjoy it a lot.The nine songs are very good, very catchy, very heavy, even with different guitarists filling Ace's job. There is a lot of outside contribution in the writing department (including Bryan Adams!!!), but this worked alright.This ia very satisfying album."
3,Potentially Excellent,"This would have been one of Kiss' best '80s albums but for a curiously thin guitar sound. Compare the chunky power chords of ""The Elder"" or ""Lick It Up"" to this mix, where the axes are largely relegated to the background, and you'll see what I mean. If ""Creatures"" were re-mixed, it would be a very heavy hitter. Riffs like ""I Love It Loud"" and ""War Machine"" really need it. Rock on..."
3,What If?,"This one kinda makes you wonder what if? What if Eric Carr &Vinny Vincent were origanal members of KISS. Every time I listento Creatures Of the Night that question pops up in my head.The highlights of this one are I Love it Loud, and War Machine.I like those and I Still Love You which is a 8 minute powerballad and I normally don't like ballads so if you like hardrockin' heavy metal KISS pick up this one. Oh, I forgot to mention this has the COOLEST album cover EVER!"
5,Ignored And Underrated In It's Time,"In retrospect, Creatures Of The Night is one of the finest Kiss records of all time, on a par, or maybe a step ahead of their mid-seventies classics. Musically, this was a comeback and a true return to form after flirtations with Top 40,disco, and a half baked concept album/soundtrack to a never made movie (Music From The Elder). Kiss returned to the type of crunch and raunch that put them on the map; it's a shame that no one was buying again until they tried the gimmick of taking the makeup off, then putting in back on (whatever). Creatures though is chock full of new Kiss classics like the title cut, the MTV video ""Love It Loud"" and the punishing ""War Machine"". Eric Carr's drumming is as powerful as the technique used to record it, making this a recommended album for drummers everywhere. Kiss simply never sounded better. A true test for your speakers!!!"
5,KISS at their heaviest!,"KISS took back the title of ""The Hottest Band In The World"" with this album. ""Creatures Of The Night"" is a thunderously heavy title track which opens the album with a punch. ""Rock N Roll Hell"" is a tune where Gene really sings on, his voice is exellent. ""Danger"" is a fast song that really gets the blood flowing. ""I Love It Loud"" is a take no prisoners anthem that shows how Gene likes his rock. ""War Machine"" is a narly, tough song that is my favorite off this record. Altogether this is one hell of an album. I highly recommend this album to any KISS fan."
2,METAL KISS,I CANT REALLY COMMENT ON THIS RERCORDING BECAUSE WHEN I RECIEVED IT ALL IT DID WAS SKIP ALL OVER THE PLACE I WAS VERY DISSAPPOINTED BECAUSE I HAD THIS ON VINYL AND LOVED IT! I GUESS I HAVE TO LOOK FOR IT AGAIN.
3,"Would have been four stars, except....","no Frehley leads. Kiss missed Ace like the Who misses John Entwistle. The complete sound just isn't there without him.Eric Carr shines throughout, though."
5,this one restored kiss to greatness.,"This cd was the one that brought back kiss to their mission statement of making kick butt rock and roll. And with songs like 'war machine' which influenced everyone from stone temple pilots to many a hard rockin band is a great example of this. ""I love it loud' was the worldwide ""hit"" on this one and it's a great song with a really cool video. The last two discs almost destroyed the band although they weren't bad discs they weren't what fans wanted. Kiss could've released this one though and 'the elder' in the same year and it would have been different. As in here's a rockin cd and here's a fun side experiment that we did ""a concept album!"" but this one sure helped bring them back into fans hearts. Although I enjoyed the last two discs , one was a pop disc though! the band returned to form here."
4,kiss creatures of the night !!!,"kiss,s creatures of the night is a great return to roots after the music from the elder,unmasked and dynasty albums,although dynasty is quite good in some places.kiss,s creatures of the night has one of the coolest album covers in rock.for me the standout cuts are;creatures of the night,killer,war machine and i love it loud!i think this is one of kiss,s heaviest albums!!so if you like kiss heavy,dark and loud this is a must!!also eric carr,s drumset sounds great and he had huge drum sets!!get this cd!!!!"
3,"Heavy Yes, But No Ace Means No Real Kiss....","This is a ""heavy"" album as some reviewers have noted. ""I Love It Loud"" is one of the most under-rated Kiss anthems and deserves maximum volume. So much for the ""good"" points. Personally having bought Kiss ""Alive"" at the age of 13 back in the early 70's, what drew me to the band was Ace's killer guitar playing.Remember the poster booklet that came with the original vinyl record...now that was cool! I digress, my point is there are no Ace guitar work (especially solos) on this album. Actually I think Vinnie Vincent was hired to play most of the guitar. Yeah you got Ace on the cover, but he's way absent once you cue up the music. So for the long, long time Kiss fan, this is most likely album where you finally gave up. Kiss in it's original form was gone forever. So on it's own this is not a bad album, but compared to the classic Kiss albums of ""Ace Frehley lead guitar"".....well there is no comparison."
3,Kiss last with makeup,"Creatures is their heaviest to date. They returned to their roots as a heavy metal band after the 79-81 experimental pop years. This one is great. Gene's voice finally or should i say truly sounds Demonized than ever. Personal fave I love it loud,and Rock And Roll Hell. 3 1/2 at best. Last with makeup which does not feature Ace even though he is on the cover. Vinnie Vincent and other session guitarists are present here."
5,Easily one of their best CDs EVER,"I never understood why this CD got overlooked and everybody raves about ""Destroyer"", which is a good CD but not nearly as dead on as this CD. Since Ace is on the cover, it would have been interesting to see how different this CD might have been if Ace actuallhy PLAYED on it. Best songs: ""Saint & Sinner"", ""War Machine"", ""Danger"" ""I Love It Loud"" & ""Creatures Of The Night"" The only clunker is ""Keep Me Comin'"""
4,Best of the 80s and beyond..,"This album loses one star because some raspy Peter Criss vocals and stinging Ace Frehley leads would have fit perfectly. However, the song writing on this album is near perfect and along with ""Hotter than Hell"" it is their heaviest effort ever. It is melodic metal at it finest. Its a shame it was overlooked at the time because of its embarrasing and pitiful predecesser ""Unmasked"".Best tracks: ""Creatures of the Night"", ""War Machine"", ""Saint and Sinner"", and ""I Love It Loud""."
5,Very cute book!,Very cute book for fans of Spongebob. Has lots of pictures and info on Spongebob and where he lives. It is definitley worth it for the price.
1,Trivia Book...Not,"This was not at all what you'd expect in a Trivia Book, first of all you would assume it would be contain trivia...e.g. trivia questions and answers...well you'd be wrong. It is a total of 44 pages, more than half of which are drawings and the majority of the rest are things that anyone that has seen more than a dozen episodes of Spongebob already know. For example, it tells you who SB's neighbors and friends are, what they like, where they live and where SB works! Why they couldn't make a fun trivia book with the answers at the end is incredible. My 8 year old thought it totally lame and I totally agree. Take my advice and don't waste your money."
3,Is it me?,"Is it me or does this music have Let's Active written all over it. It has been a while, but I think he even sounds like Mitch Easter here, which I would never say about GF.Also note that the 3 star rating doesn't mean much. I wrote the above based on the sound clips."
4,Entertaining The Grandkids,"My four year old granddaughter really likes this movie, and it is one I will watch with her. I enjoy the musicas well as the story.. Definately a family movie."
5,Still I Rise,"One day I was driving on the express way to work and on the radio I heard, this song ""Still I Rise"" and It really ministered to me. It reassured me,that no matter how hard life seems to be, especially if you are a Christian and the enemy trys to weight you down, with the burdens and cares of this world... Still I Rise. And it is through Christ Jesus, we have the victory. Yolanda Adams has been a GREAT inspiration to me through her music ministry. Songs from the Heart - is exactly that ""Songs from the Heart"""
4,Yolanda Adams is a very talented vocalist.,"This is a nice album, even though it has a different feel"
5,These songs are from the heart!!!!,"I must say this CD help me through some rough times. I first listened to this CD from a friend who let me borrow it my freshman year of college. I recently pulled out this CD because I wanted something that would uplift me and I thought songs from the heart. I must say I fell in love with ""Still I Rise"" She works her voice on this song so well. This CD is nice and relaxing. It is jazzy and smooth. Like somone mentioned in another review this cd has very nice Jazz overtones. All of the tracks are great.Peace and Enjoy"
5,Simply Incredible,"I purchased this single for the non-album tracks and was not disappointed! ""Cry"" is a great album, and it's a shame the bonus songs here didn't make the final cut. Okay, this single is the same price as the album in many stores, but it's worth the price for ""Shadows"" alone. This is Faith at her best in a heartfelt ballad, very similar to ""Stronger."" ""Wicked"" is a mid-tempo song in the vein of ""Unsaveable"" and ""If You're Gonna Fly Away.""These songs are a great addition to ""Cry."" I've recorded it all onto my hard drive and put ""Wicked"" after ""Unsaveable"" and ""Shadows"" after ""Stronger."" It only makes the album better!"
1,"environmental design, what environmental desing?","The book is a collection of unrelated projects around the world without a proper theme. Badly printed photographs and reproduced drawings (plan, section etc) occupies most of the volume. Each of the project is provided with a journalistic review that an undergraduate student in any reputable university could utter. There is no technical data to support the writings. For example, nobody in their right mind would call the Treasury Building in Singapore an environmentally friendly building. To promote environmental design, we do not need pseudo-science. My advise is: save your money, buy a science fiction, you probably get better advice there. For me, I have bin the book."
2,Dissapointed with drill quality,"Paid a premium for a drill to be pre-attached. The picture clearly shows a Makita drill attached. I haven't even used the mortar gun yet, but I've used Black and Decker, and would not have paid over $100 more if I had known this is what it was going to come with.It looks as though the seller has added the Black and Decker info and a picture of a Black and Decker drill sometime between the time my order was placed and when it arrived.Wondering what other surprises might be in store when I use it."
3,mmmmmmmmmmmmm..........,"I cant say that it is a bad album...but there are songs that are really bad, like thrills in the night. Heavens on fire is a super song comparing with the rest."
2,Typical 80's shlock,"When Gene Simmons said that he did not like any albums after Lick it Up, there was a reason for it. Simmons was barely involved in this album and Mark St. John may have been the worst Guitar player in Kiss history just because he never would have fit into the band. Heaven's on Fire is a very good song but I would be hard pressed to think of another song that is good."
2,How many people here have the Album.... Animalize?,"A year later after Lick it Up's release KISS returns but this time with a new guitarist who's name really isn't worth mentioning. Why is that, you ask? Well, this guy was only with KISS for about as long as the Album last's. Anyway, I only really like 3 songs from Animalize and they are:""I've Had Enough (into the fire)"" RULES! I love this song, Paul's vocals once again make this song. 5 stars.""Burn Bitch Burn"" My 10th favorite KISS song EVER! Gene RULES and the backing vocals do to. 5 stars.""While the City Sleeps"" I really like this song even though alot of people don't. I think Gene delivers on this one and it could've very well fit nicely on Creatures of the Night or Lick it Up IMO. 4 stars.Buy ""Animalize"" for these tracks ONLY or if you're a KISS Fanatic like myself, you must complete your KISS collection."
5,awsome cd,I am big fan of Kiss but dont have all the cd but i am geting there.This cd is a very good a cd and i love it
2,Almost mediocre - a few good songs,"The mid eighties was not the best time for Kiss records. Especially Genes songs were terrible, just listen to the ones on this record (""While the city sleeps"" is an exception, a pretty good song). Paul also struggles, but he's got some decent songs on this one. I liked this record when it was released, but would not listen to it today. Thrills in the night is a very cool song, but it is too slow."
2,Animalize is raw,Some very raw rock here;that's why the 2 rating instead of a 1.The opening song I've Had Enough is actually one of the best album openers Kiss has ever had and Under the Gun is not a bad tune as well BUT the rest of the songs fail to impress bigtime.Thrills in The Night has to be one of the most annoying Kiss singles ever and all of Gene Simmons' songs sound so bad he must have wrote them while he was counting his money.
4,Animalize is ok,"While it may be the best selling out the Unmasked albums its not my favorite album that one will go to 1992's ""Revenge"" The best cuts are ""Heaven's on fire"" ""I've had enough into the fire"" and ""Burn Bit*h burn"" and the chorus in ""Get all you can take"" and a lyric line in it that most people dont know is there it goes ""WHat (...) differnce can it make?"" While Animalize is a good album its not the best its worth it if your into 80's metal or a KISS fan"
4,"Kiss, ""Animalize"" 1984",The second album of KISS with no makeup. This album is pretty good all the songs on here are good and its a good 80s rock album but the reason here I give it four stars is that because this isnt the KISS from the 70s. This was the KISS that was different and had no makeup and there sound changed completly. I still think its pretty good but its the only non makeup album ive bought because i prefer there makeup days with the original members...1. Ive Had Enough Into The Fire 4/5 stars2. Heavens On Fire 5/5 stars3. Burn Bitch Burn 5/5 stars4. Get All You Can Take 3/5 stars5. Lonely Is The Hunter 4/5 stars6. Under The Gun 3/5 stars7. Thrills In The Night 5/5 stars8. While The City Sleeps 3/5 stars9. Murder In High Heels 5/5 stars
1,Worst Kiss album ever,"If you are like me, you are a big Kiss fan, but are too cheap to buy every album they ever did. This is without a doubt their worst. If you must get it, buy it at a pawn shop or used record store.... I'm sure you won't have any trouble finding them there."
3,Good but not the best,now a follow up 2 lick it up would be difficult after departure of Vinnie V. (who co-wrote 8 of the 10 songs on lick it up) but this is like a Paul Stanley solo album featuring KISS but gene at least tries 2 write songs but here r the ones that i think was the bestI've Had Enough (Into The Fire)Heaven's on FireThrills in the NightUnder the Gunbut really Paul proved he is a great writer on this album but Gene really shouldn't have tried writing cuz burn bitch burn sucks3/5
3,Interesting!,"As i read on an Roy Webb Page yesterday the material on this cd consists of original soundtrack material from the 40s! The qualtity is quite good, in fact as good as possible because some of the material was slightly deteriorated. Alls tracks were digitally cleaned up/remasterd. Nevertheless, you have the original Hollywood Studio Orchestra Sound from the 40s! What can i say more... A must have to lovers of exellent old hollywood film music!!"
5,"A Crazy, Comical Volume you just have to buy!!!","This is one of the best volumes in the Magical Project S series.This volume is mostly about friendship,and love. In episode 8, I think it's really cute when Misao and Sasami hold hands. In episode 9, there's a lot of twists and turns when Sasami and her father land on a deserted island. Who will save them? Will Pixy Misa get there first? In episode 10, Sasami and her father travel to a western town and meet a friend. There, Sasami has her work cut out for her as Pixy Misa arrives to help the mayors enemy destroy the town. This is a wacky and fun volume you just don't want to miss!!!!"
4,Pretty Sammy in the motorcycle sidecart is sooo cute,"This is volume 3 of 8 as Pretty Sammy's adventures continue.My favorite scenes from this volume are when Pretty Sammy is a passenger in father's motorcyle sidecart. Very very cute. Unfortunately, her father is not the best of drivers, and they get lost and crash land onto an island. Will Pixy Misa be able to find here here?Pretty Sammy fanatics know that 4 different instances of this series exist. Pretty Sammy originated in a follow-up to the Tenchi Muyo OVA called the ""Mihoshi Special"" and later re appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series. Next came the OVA, and finally this Magical Project S TV series.This is great for those of us who like really cute stuff and are kids or kids at heart."
5,A must for start-ups,"This book is a must for anyone starting up a daycare business or for those whose creditors are demanding a financial and/or business plan. I created my business plan using this and other resources, but this was by far the most helpful. The spreadsheet examples took half the work out of my way, and I was able to set it all up in Excel using her strategies. With my spreadsheets in hand I was able to back into my expenses using her method, and then work my way into the rates charged from there (as opposed to setting rates and then realizing later that my costs exceeded my cash flow). A very helpful resource!"
2,I would not recommend it to seasoned educational administrators,There are multiple spelling errors in the CD attached documents. Spread sheets are not labeled in any way so you are digging in the book to refer to the proper spread sheet and even when you get there it is not what you can use.A real disappointment.
4,"Good FPS, but......","This game is definitely a great upgrade from Rogue Spear, there's no arguing that. I mean, this game is very realistic down to the enemies panicking and running away, like real ones might. Then why 4 stars? Because if only I could figure out those callsigns. Even with the guide book I got, I still am clueless and there by resort to completing the missions with one man and no set floor plan. If they had made it simpler, then maybe there would be 5 stars in its future.But, I'm not going to waste this time complaining. Besides thatm this game has realistic gun fire, muzzle flashes, enemy reactions, rate-of-fire of every gun, accuracy of each one and my god the list goes on..... This game is very much worth the money and should be bought by any die hard FPS player."
3,good game but...,"this game is really good but the only down side is the price. it's a rip off. i got the rogue spear platinum pack for $[money] and it came with rogue spear, mission pack urban ops, and the rogue spear(also featuring the urban ops) strategy guide. all of this for only $[money], even if u do have regular rogue spear, still buy it and give it to a friend or if u lose ur copy just keep it for safe keeping, or sell it. but i repeat, buy the platinum pack."
3,Great Game.... So So Mission Pack,"I love Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear. I couldn't wait to get this game. I tore it from the hands of the UPS guy and installed it immediately. About 45 minutes later I was triumphant. Very disappointing. I was hoping to be tied up with it for a few days. I liked the new weapons and levels, but for the price I paid, I was very disappointed. I mean, please. . . Even so, the game, what there was of it, was entertaining and suspenseful."
2,Same Old Stuff,"When a Rainbow Six game would come out, I would be excited because I liked the game. Yet now it is losing ""brownie points"" with me. Game after game, each one only has a few new weapons and places to kill people. That's the other thing, the gun shots to the players and enemies are not realistic. Most people, when shot, bleed more and die in much more painful ways. The game's AI and weapons are the only reason I give this game two stars. If you are a Die Hard fan like I was, then you'll like this. But sooner or later, you will be fed up with this ficticious game. If I were you, I would try Soldier of Fortune. As realistic as can be. It's explosive realism makes it difficult to tell the difference between it being a game or real life."
4,Good starting basis to work on vocabulary,"I bought this book as it was recommended on Magoosh for GRE prep. I'm not sure how much it is helping as I find that many of the words I already knew. What I can say is that I loved working through workbooks when I was a kid, so if nothing else, this is a relaxing activity for me before bed that challenges my brain."
2,More information would have been helpful,"This book was described as ""used"". It would have been helpful to know that it was a workbook and ""used"" meant that the first 70 pages had all the answers written in. Unable to use those pages. I would have opted to buy new for a little bit more."
2,not what I expected,"I thought this would be more practical. I think it's more for writers, not middle school age students, which was why I purchased it. I must've missed something, somewhere in the description."
5,Very useful for advanced learners,"This book sets the goal of learning English by putting the new words into natural context - sometimes repeating already-learned ones along with new ones -, and useful related quiz-tasks. Also, you can find the pronunciation of the words...which is not obvious in such books. But only for advanced learners!"
3,alright,"I needed this book for a class at school. I found it to be very long and boring. It's not that it's not helpful, but it just has exercises and paragraphs in which you have to find the definitions for a word. I was hoping for straight definitions as well.... was trying to study for an exemption exam at school but this was just way too much work to read this long book...."
4,like a new book,I GOT THE BOOK VERY QUICKLY.FROM THE APPEARANCE IT WAS HARD TO TELL THAT THE BOOK WAS USED.
5,1100 words you need to know,it is very helpful to my son. He copies the stories every morning. He got excellent scores at sat test.
1,Horrible,"I looked at dozens of books for my daughter. Most of them were the same format - list of words, boring drills, end of section quizzes. This book adds a new and annoying twist...each group of words is presented in a paragraph, so the student needs to try to figure all the words out in context. Students who are puzzled end up going to the dictionary to find the meaning of the words, because the book - get this - does not have have definitions!"
3,"Excellent idea, BUT","I recently purchased the 2000 edition to use with my college-bound students who need more vocabulary work, as, for many of them, English is not their first language. The presentation and layout are excellent, the extracts are interesting and informative, and the ""Panorama"" section is relevant. I am concerned, however, about the errors in the answer section and the occasional typo. I have found a total of 21 errors - surely too high for a text which aims to ""improve college grades"" and to help you ""score high on the SAT1"". Check the answers carefully - the errors are pretty obvious and so should have been spotted before publication. These spoil an otherwise excellent book which should have had 5 stars."
3,"Should Be Called ""Secure Clips""","Speed clips are such a bad name for these things. They are cool. They secure most pouches really well - much better than the pouches with the button straps sewn to them. But they are a real pain in the butt to use. You're not going to be changing pouches around in the field. You can before you run a mission so long as you have 20 minutes before hand to screw around with your vest and pouches to get them all mounted properly. Speed clips they are not. Secure clips, absolutely. Also be sure to buy every different size because they sizes they send with the various pouches are never the best sizes to use for those items."
4,best option,"there are several choices for attaching molle accessories to pals wedding. i've tried malice clips and 511 slicksticks. both of these work well. blackhawk speed clips are slightly easier to use. i have all 4 sizes,"
5,Good to go,"They seem a little pricey. But they look good and appear to be well constructed. They come packaged in a super ultra heavy duty ziplock bag, that has to add to the cost."
5,A Wonderful Prayerbook.,"I am happy that I purchased this prayerbook, for not only is it attractive with its leatherette cover and gilded pages, but it is also well bound with thick pages guaranteeing a lifetime of use. Its bold print makes for easy reading, and the prayers within are both simple and profound, earnest and powerful ... a must for any Catholic. I enjoy having available the Latin equivalent of the popular prayers. In the midst of all the daily distractions from prayer in this fast-paced world, one will find this attractive book a tempting invitation to spend time with God."
5,Most Bang For The Buck,"I'm finally getting into the Home Theater experience and I can tell you these speakers can handle the output from my Sony STRDE 945 receiver with no problem. I don't know how load you like to play your sound tracks but I can tell you my dogs were freak out enough to leave the living room. You must add the KLH 100 watts 8 "" subwoofer to complete the setup. It can be had for under ($) if you shop around. One setback is the sound reproduced when using 2-channel stereo. It's a little on the thin side. They are identical in design, which is important in home theater sound, and you can't beat the great price. KLH doesn't spend a lot on advertising so don't think these are cheap junk. They come with plenty of cheap (22 gauge) speaker wire though. Amazon sells the Acoustic Research HT604 Home Theater Hookup for ($), which I bought and can recommend."
3,Adorable,"Very cute. However once you hang it and put anything heavier than a couple pairs of clothes it sags really bad and can come undone. It is, however, very cute like I said."
3,Didn't get ground in dirt up from Natural Fusions vinyl flooring.,"Still have to get on my hands and knees with a scrub brush. We have red clay dirt here, product didn't dissolve dirt to thoroughly clean floor."
5,Thought provoking,"Strange, but enchanting, sci fi. The demise of man and the rise of dogs (and robots). A little homesy to begin with, but all in context. Well worth the read."
4,"Emergence, intuited in the '50s!!!","I was fortunate to read this the same time as the non-fiction bookEmergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Softwarewhich presents science that is amazingly close to the subjects Simak writes about. Perhaps some of you remember the original SimCity, SimAnt and SimEarth games the preceded The Sims. This book might have inspired those games, because the similarities are uncanny, even eerie. Also Simak presents ideas about ""parallel worlds"" and alternative timelines-- back in the fifties! The prose itself is not spectacular. Like a lot of other sci-fi writers, he annoyingly assumes the entire world will follow the American political-economic route into a prosperous homogeneous global culture. Settings like Geneva, Switzerland are presented without any landmarks or details of the landscape. But if you read sci-fi for the exploration possible future technologies and far-out ideas, this book delivers, and stands up to the test of time."
5,One of the very best...,"Clifford Simak was among the brightest luminaries of modern SF, and two of his novels have never lost their power to capture the reader and to hold he or she enthralled - TIME IS THE SIMPLEST THING and CITY. Even if you sometimes despair of, or have little interest in, SF, read them both.CITY, with its canine civilization, and its memories of Man, is one of the most touching of novels - unusual in this genre is an understatement.New editions of all Simak's works are long, long overdue!"
2,Not What I Thought,I ordered this because I thought it had a story about Petra. It did not. So basically I wasted my time & money. Too bad. So now I'm looking for the short story about Petra. I will then buy another book if it has that one. The ball is in someone else's court.
3,Not Bad,"...but not that great either. I guess you could say I'm a Simak fan, I've read a few of his novels, and I've liked them all pretty well, but this was not really up to his standard. I really don't understand how it got all of these terrific reviews. It was a good book, but nothing out of the ordinary. In my opinion, if you are new to Simak's work, or just have not read it yet, Ring Around the Sun is the book to read. That is a great novel, of a much higher caliber than City. Plus, I think it's still in print. As I said, not bad, but not really great either."
5,A magnificent 2nd year textbook,"I have taught out of Pasajes Lengua from time to time over the last 10 years throughout several editions. The Fifth Edition, with Rodney Bransdorfer added to the author team, appears to be their hottest edition yet. The grammar activities are better organized and cleaned up, and the presentation in the book is sharper and more comprehensible than ever. While many texts just lose steam after several editions, Pasajes has hit its peak!"
5,The Bible of refrence for your health,"I received this book for a wedding present 9 years ago and thought ""what a silly gift"". I was so wrong! This has been such a HUGE source of information for myself and entire family. I was able to diagnose my little brother with a life threating illness before anyone else...including the emergency staff in the hospital. Every house should have this book!"
3,"still can not install, box looks good","Regardless how good a bargin it is, I just can not find an ""installation guide"" that will work after a long search in google. You may see it as a ""good buy"", but if you are not a super computer geek, it may just not work for you. The box looks good though."
5,Home Is Where The Heart Is,"Peter Gabriel's Real World enterprise has thrown up some marvels to world audiences.Yungchen Lhamo is a voice the world needs and may easily have been denied: and the biographical data is carried in the songs of'Coming Home', a quietly moving document. In this instance, the expatriate's loss of a home, is our gain. I'm reminded of Reen Kelani's awesomely poignant,'Sprinting Gazelle' for these reasons. This is simpler musical fare, but none the less effective. Lhamo has written historically, peronally and of her buddhist spiritual life. The Tuvan throat lads guest with complementary sweetness given their approximation to Tibetan temple chanting. The Real World maestros have stood back to allow Lhamos the spotlight:a bit of Gabriellesque droning, but thankfully light on his operatic flourishes."
3,Great vocalist crippled by production,"Yungchen Lhamo is worth 5 stars anytime. Unfortunately, I can only imagine how it would be if she were backed up by equally talented production. Or, I won't need to imagine - listening to Dorje-Den from ""Tibet Tibet"" gives a very good idea.Unfortunately this incredible singer caught the eye of some new-ageish producer, who applied a standard formula to westernize music they judge too exotic to the $ holding westeners. I can almost see a major gym-chain yoga class realaxing to this album, that's how bad this lifeless and sterile production is.As I listened to this CD, I came to think of the portable cassetterecorders of the 80's, with karaoke mode, so you could tune down the vocals. I found myself hoping the have the reverse, where I could tune down the elevatormusic playing on the background so that I could instead focus on some of the finest singing this planet has produced."
2,Growing Up...,"I saw this while browsing the library shelves, so I had to check it out. Once I started reading, it took me a minute to realize that this is fiction and not the author's life story. That darn picture on the cover totally fooled me. Once I got that straight, I just muddled through until the end. I can't explain it. I usually find something appealing about stories about Black southern life, but this one did not move me one bit. I didn't even become slightly more interested until I got toward the end and the situation with Gayla's husband. I still am perplexed about how growing up 'nigger rich' was germane to the story. The main character still had to endure the prejudices that were prevalent during her childhood. The wealth her family had only seemed to allow for more material possessions, if anything. Maybe it was just too deep for me. I did like the writing style, though. Oh, well. Back to my usual fluff. 2 stars."
5,Mainstream samba,"This is pretty mainstream samba/bossa nova if there is such a thing in Brazilian music. Having said that, there are a few secrets hidden beneath the surface. This is the type of CD you want to play when you're just kicking around, or doing the groove thing, or maybe just wanting to get carried off to Ipanema Beach in your living room while you have the candles on and sip some wine or fine beer. If you happen to be by the ocean with some steady, nice waves rolling in on the beach on a summer evening, or in your backyard by the pool, this CD sets the mood. Excellent recording, with lots of stellar guests. The strings are arranged by Morelenbaum(and I'm sure he plays the cello on some tracks), who did Caetano's strings on ""Livro"", which shows Celso keeps good company. Like ""Livro"", it's got the horns echoing Miles Davis too. Great mellow CD."
5,Book two is worth reading book 1 for.,"Finally the plot gets going in the Abarat series. Book one is really a linear, I go on a journey story. It sets up all the plot lines for book 2 but they really go nowhere. Book 2, things heat up, the plot moves right a long and when I started I had a hard time putting the book down. I won't ruin the plot line by repeating it here. But its alegory is that of a young girl finding herself and her place in the world. Plus the usual chases, close escapes, fights makes it entertaining even for guys. My kids didn't like it as well as some other fanasty books they have read, but I think they under estimate the staying power of this book.In addition, Clive's illustrations have gotten a lot better. Practice has improved things tremendously!I will be awaiting book 3 at the front of the line."
4,Continue on the Magical Journey,This book continues the journey of Candy Quackenbush. The artwork of Clive Barker is yet again amazing and colorful. You will get so sucked into this story that you will not be able to put the book down
1,Misleading description on softcover version,"Great young adult writing, with gorgeous paintings that bring it to life.At least that's what you get from the hardcover version.On the softcover version Clive Barker is still listedas both author and illustrator.The description gives no clue that this is inaccurate, asthe are NO illustrations in the softcover version.Highly recommend the hardcover, loaded with full color platesof the author's paintings. Despite appearances from the productdescription, the softcover is text only the cover is only illustration,and you'll be missing a major part of the series."
3,"too much imagination, too little plot","I know I'm in the minority, but I've been underwhelmed by this series. Clive Barker clearly has a vivid imagination -- there are more fantastical creatures and settings running around in his brain than he knows what to do with. Some of the creatures are interesting, particularly those like Malingo whom we actually get to know. But too many pages are taken up with inventories of oddities -- some seen by Candy on her travels, others involving the terrible Christopher Carrion and his assorted gruesome hangers-on. Most of these creations are irrelevant or tangential to the plot, so that I wound up skimming through those passages going ""blah, blah, blah,"" while waiting for something to happen that would actually advance the story arc. I don't think I'll bother with the next book."
4,4 Stars for the Newest Work of Art!,"Beautifully written, and amazing storyline. I personally did not like the ending, due to an attachment to one of the characters, but most probably will love it."
3,"Beautiful art, tiresome story.","I have loved Clive Barker's unique and interesting stories for many years. I have read Imajica three times over, always returning to it every few years. So, I was incredibly excited when Abarat was released.....fusing Barker's amazing art work with his equally amazing story telling talents.Sadly I found the first volume, and moreso, this second volume of Abarat to be tiresome to read. I understand that it is pitched at a young adult market, but even so, the actual story is just so boring and predictable. I found myself not caring whether Candy discovered her true destiny, or what adventures lay in wait for her and Malingo. My only impetus for finishing the book was to better understand what was being presented in the vivid, awe inspiring illustrations.I have to agree with a previous reviewer, and hope that Barker returns to more interesting stories....I have been eagerly awaiting the Third Book of the Art for a long time....."
1,No payoff,"This book lacks essential pieces of a story. The world is beautiful and very well-described. Side characters are vibrant and catchy. Some scenes are even poignant.Yet the main character is a mess. There's no consistent motivation, nothing interesting about her, she's special for no reason, does stupid things that aggravate and annoy the reader instead of being understood, and she even is the reason for random flashbacks to why she's so special (this happens more than three times).B 3/4 of the story, you barely know what the villain wants, you have no idea why the main character is worth caring about, and no idea why it's about her instead of the more interesting ones."
5,Great book,"Clive Barker's personal life freeks me out, but he is a fantastic writer. If you can just overlook the freeky stuff."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS FOR A KINDLE/KINDLE APP! Buy a hard copy.,"The book is good. However, it is hugely lost in this format because none of the beautiful images created for this story are included. There's well over 100 images in the book that are not in the kindle version Buy a hard copy. It's worth it."
5,I love this book,"This is one of my favorite books, and i wanted to re-read the series. The book was in great condition and was just as I remembered it"
4,4 stars because...,"Product received was not the same as in the picture. It was Fushigi Yugi - The Mysterious Play: Box Set 2 - Seiryu (Episodes 27-52) but not the same packaging. Which means it doesn't match the episodes 1-26 packaging I already own. I still enjoy the series but will re-purchase these episodes when I can find the correct packaging so I have a matching set. Highly recommend the series though, I am pretty picky about the anime I watch so by my word this is one of the good ones. Hope you like it as much as I do."
3,Caution: About the New/Used DVDs,"I want to second the warning about the 3 disk Import DVDs that are being sold in the New/Used section. While I was able to get mine to play and all episodes were there, the quality is pretty bad. The picture is dark and grainy and the sound track does not match up with the visual. Sound effects and voices occur a few seconds after the action. It's really quite disappointing.I'm puzzled as to why there are no (or at least none listed as such) used DVDs of the ""legitimate"" 4 disk version."
2,Bootleg Version,"I am not rating the content of the series, just the actual DVD set you will receive. If you buy this item, you will spend a lot of money for a 3 DVD set, which is a cheaply-produced bootleg. It is NOT the original Pioneer release as pictured. I have the Pioneer version of the Suzaku set, and quality on the bootleg is inferior. This may be your only option to obtain these episodes these days; but I just want people to know what they are buying before they pull the trigger. I was very disappointed upon opening the package."
3,Not what I purchased.,"Unfortunately I bought this item from a used seller, the episodes are intact and they have all the items included. It just happened to be a bootleg, not what I thought I was purchasing. I don't support bootlegs, reguardless of quality. Just make sure if you are looking for the actual box set in the image above, you are getting it. Not the blue box bootleg."
1,I Ordered 12.5 grams (10cc) for $10.93 as a Prime Member,"I ordered the 12.5 grams size (10cc) for $10.93NOW Foods, LAVILIN UNDERARM DEODORANT CREAM - 12.5 gm (10cc)as a Prime Member. I had been debating whether to buy the size I did or the .44 oz size thinking it was more given it was in ounces and the higher price of $13.99. I found out that .44 oz is the same as 12.5 grams when I went to this site [...]. In fact .44 oz is actually 12.473790164 grams rounded up to 12.5. Please do go the the site to check it out. Same amount just charged more because it sounds like more product. I did hit the ""Contact Us"" button to speak with an Amazon Customer Service rep to report this. The woman I spoke with wrote up a report and told me she would forward it for investigation. As I just ordered Lavalin I cannot give an accurate review at this time but I will after I receive it and use it long enough to form enough of an opinion to leave feedback for it."
3,"well, it works but not as what I expected","well, it works but not as what I expected. one apply, it only last for 2 days. I don't know it is just me, or the product doesn't function as good as before. what a pity. I guess I will not buy it again if it is still like this."
1,It used to work,"I have used this product for several years. I found the old product in the black container to be working very well. When the company changed its packaging, they also must have changed the formula, because ever since I started using the product from the white container, it does not work at all. It spreads easier, but so what? I find it to be useless, ineffective, and a waste of money."
5,I cannot believe it worked!,I would be happy to find a natural deodorant that worked for one day. This one works for days! I even work out and sweat but no smell! I have tried just about every other brand. Anti-perspirants leave cysts under my arms and the crystals have the same effect.
3,Lavilin Review,"I've been using Lavilin, starting w/the black box and container, and it worked just as stated. It was manufactured by Ahava (sic) in Israel. It's been over 30 years, but within the last two/three years, after the change to the US, I've noticed that it isn't as effective anymore. I could go for a week or longer w/o using more, but it's not about a good product, it's about money. They've made this product less effective AND the price keeps creeping upwards. I'm very disappointed and will not use it anymore OR advise it's use to anyone else. Money over loyal customers--that's the business model."
4,Very Good Product,I purchased this item after having used it before. I have found that it takes very little and works over several days while it does not work for seven days as the box says. I have found that the little jar lasts a very long time.
1,not a good product,"According to most of the reviews this is a great product. I followed all the intructions, no deodorant before use, etc... It didn't work at all.I think, it actually gave me more bad odor. Like eeeew odor.There is a better product that this one.So, sorry."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I was really hoping this would work, but it didn't. I went the 48 hours without applying other deoderant(like the directions said) before I tried Lavilin. I then applied it at night and showered in the morning. However I was still sweating and it did not prevent the perspiration odor from occuring later that day. I gave it one more try by using it after I showered but that didn't work either."
2,Lavilin Underarm Deodorant,"I have used Lavilin for many, many years and am truly disappointed that the company changed the formula and I now get about half as long from one application. With the black container I did not have to apply deodorant for 10 to 15 days. With the new formula in the white container it only lasts 3 to 5 days."
1,Disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed in the performance of this deodorant especially after all the positive reviews I'd read. I followed the preparation directions to a ""T"". applied the cream Monday morning and by early afternoon, I had started smelling. Now, I'm 60 years old and the most strenuous exercise I get is a brisk walk. Monday it was 73 degrees and I had my brisk walk and started smelling. Not after two or three days but after only 4 hours. I decided to carry on for a few more hours and the smell worsened. Tried applying again being more careful to spread evenly and more widely and still the same outcome so I've given up. It's all fine and dandy to try to try and not use alcohol or aluminum based deodorants but when even I can't stand to be around me why should I inflict the smell on other people?"
4,Might take getting used to,"This is a very good product. I discovered it in trying to avoid a daily dose of chemicals, and it works just fine. I see from other reviews that some people might be expecting the perfect dryness they got from standard antiperspirants, and you just won't get that here--it IS a deodorant. It is very important to follow the directions for starting use, and in that transition period you might feel uncomfortable. There's nothing that says you can't wash more frequently or augment the Lavillin with corn starch or powder, so try that. Once your body adjusts, you will probably use it about twice a week, maybe three times in the summer. Give it a chance, and I think you'll be happy with it."
3,"Interesting Idea, mixed results","Like others I was intrigued by the idea of a one week deoderant. The first time I tried it it worked for about 3-4 days, so I was psyched. The second application was less effective though, only lasting about 36 hours. A little expensive for that kind of performance.I'm also curious about how it works and couldn't find enough info on the potential health effects. I want to avoid aluminum. An alternative product which is all natural and works like regular deodorant is ""Naturally Fresh Deodorant Crystal Roll-On"" by TCCD International. This is made from Thai crystals, but is easier to apply. Good luck!"
1,BETTER THAN LAVILLIN,"LAVILLIN IS CRAP!! I never got to try the ""old formula"" everyone is talking about, but I can tell about a deodorant cream that is probably the same as the ""old formula"".Go TO: [...].The first time I tried this stuff it lasted a week!! I'm young, extremely active, and I sweat ALOT. The first time I tried LAVILLIN it lasted 1 day. And every time after that. If you want more bang for your buck go to iherb.com"
3,It works somewhat,"I don't think it works as well as it claims to, but it does work at least a little better than the other ""natural"" deodorants I've tried. I like it because it doesn't have much scent of its own. It's not true that one application will last for weeks or a month. I'm finding I need to apply it at least every few days. I'm curious to try the ""Now"" brand of underarm deodorant cream and see how it compares to Lavilin. I've ordered it so we'll see. I would buy this product again even though it doesn't work quite as well as it claims to.The one thing I am concerned about health-wise is the ""micro"" component. Supposedly nano-particles of ingredients like zinc oxide are carcinogenic. I'm not sure whether this product uses the nano form of zinc oxide or not."
1,Not Really Worth It...,"This just didn't work. I waited the three days of using no deoderant per the instructions. I tried applying sparingly (it didn't work). I tried applying liberally (still didn't work). The cream has the smell and consistency of diaper rash cream and contains a lot of zinc - so perhaps this is just modified diaper cream! I don't mind sweating (as I did with this product) but I had smelly pits in less than a day. I'm now off to try Herbal Magic Roll-On deoderant, recommended by several friends at work."
1,Expensive and worthless,"I've never had trouble finding a deodorant that worked, but one that doesn't irritate my skin has been elusive. I really hoped Lavilin would do the job, but it completely failed me. While it was gentle on my skin, it was completely ineffective. I abstained from other deodorants for 48+ hours and then applied Lavilin after showering, yet by the next day my armpits were getting pretty ""pungent"". I showered again and reapplied the Lavilin, this time quite liberally - only to be greeted by the return of odor by the next morning. Summing it up, Lavilin is: A)Expensive, B)Difficult to apply to hairy armpits, C)Completely ineffective at preventing odor, but D)Does come in a pretty box."
3,This scent has changed over the years,"I happen to have a bottle of 4711 that is quite old, at least 25 years. If I am reading the label correctly it appears to have been produced in the U.S. under license by Carter-Wallace. Comparing that bottle to a new one the scents bear very little resemblance to one another. The older cologne has the complex citrussy smell that initially attracted me while the new one smells remarkably like inexpensive gin--mainly alcohol and lemon. After the strong aroma of alcohol abates, what remains has what I would call a 'powdery' aspect to it, very different from the cologne produced decades ago. These observations are of course irrelevant if what you know and appreciate is the current version of this fragrance, but if your memory is of the former version be sure to check this out in person before purchase."
2,disappointed,I was disappointed that the race car gets stuck around the cruves you have to keep pushing it.
2,Fun while it lasts.,Our son got this toy for a christmas present and loved it - for about a day. He loved making the car move on his own - all you have to do is push down on the driver's head. Then it stopped moving on its own. We took the car apart to see if we could fix the problem but the gears are made of plastic and the teeth broke on one and we were unable to get it to move on its own again. We still have the gift receipt and are going to return it and see if we can get one that will last for more than one day. At the very least it would be nice of Fisher Price to sell individual cars that would work on the track once the orginal one breaks if they can't make a model that will stand up to the wear and tear of a 1 1/2 year old.Overall I have been happy with other Little People set we have - this was just really disappointing because our son was really enjoying it (and we were too).
2,"Get the farm, please!","We had the same problem with the durability of the car (seems the ""clutch"" stripped after a few minutes of play) and the difficulty making it around the track.The Little People farm is a much better choice, triggering so much imaginative play. The farm animals get more use out of the race track than the car driver does - the chicken has learned how to drive, the rest of the critters like to sit in the grandstands, and the food cart gets tuned up at the pit stop.Oh, and my 2 year old uses the award stand as a ""compooter"" to play school."
2,Low-End Little People Product,"Seems to me the ""Little People"" sub-brand comes in two versions, the high-quality, durable ones that promote hours of play (like the farm and the gargage) and the low-quality, poorly made ones that seems to take up space. this is one of those. The racetrack is made of flimsy plastic, takes up a lot of space for what it is (doesn't fold up or anything -- you have to take it completely apart if you want to store it). The car itself is pretty solid, but doesn't always function well."
4,toddlers love it!,"This is perhaps one of the greatest presents I've ever given my nephew. He loves it and it's fun to watch him get so excited about the car (just the right size for him) and the racing. He especially enjoys ""fixing"" it."
2,The worst of our Little People toys,"My kids (2 and 4) have had this for about a year. It hardly ever gets played with. The house, castle, garage, farm, zoo, barn, boat, circus, playground... everything else we've tried is a big hit. This has little if any creative play possibilites. My son loves to see things go, and this does move around the racetrack, but he gets bored with it as soon as we get it out. As another reviewer noted, it takes up a lot of space when it's taken apart into its four sections. We have not, however, had any problems with durability."
2,Broken Cars are no fun,The car broke after just a couple of days. It won't go around the track without being pushed. It never held much interest for him. He loves watching a train so I thought it would be a hit but he was scared by the sounds when we first got it. It took up a great deal of space and was limited in it's play possibilities. Very disappointing.
2,Does not work!!!!!!,My one year old got this as a First Birthday present - he loves cars and so he loves this toy but it went around on it own just twice or thrice. We have to push it a couple of times at each corner. Would have been a great toy if it had worked.Really disappointing that it has hardly every worked.
3,Hardly HERE'S TO LIFE II...,"...but STILL so much better than what passes for ""jazz"" singing these days, I can't give it a complete pan! However, the tempi are even slower than you'd expect from Ms. Horn, her pitch is starting to become questionable (not to mention her vibrato!?) and the choice of songs is NOT as choice as the last Mandel-Horn pairing. Plus, Johnny's charts are nothing spectacular - and I'm sorry: from him, I expect spectacular! I'm not recycling it, but it sure doesn't touch HERE'S TO LIFE!"
3,Drowning...,"...slowly. Sinking...surely. Shirley?The Amazon.com review above has this disc floating, like silk cloth on a summer breeze -- 'er something like that...But, I gotta tell you, as a S.H. fan and Mandel junkie, this CD is a narrow road to nowhere...a stone sinking quickly into muddy waters. Where once it seemed like urbane sophistication - elegant melancholy mixed with joyous uplift - it now reminds me of too many Rob Roys, a second helping of Prozac, Viagra misfired and -- well, before I get into too much trouble with the diehards here, a resounding vote for twin beds in your parents' room.I don't like these confessions. I wanted to be moved, and so I was - in the wrong direction. I've never heard such beautiful songs slowed down to such a level of suffocation...why?Somebody throw me a lifeline...I'm drowning...."
4,"Exquisite, but..............................................","Why does she include 4-5 songs done on other CD's? Don't get me wrong, I am a ""dyed in the wool"" Shirley Horn fan. She could sing the ""yellow pages"" and I'd buy it. Shirley and Johnny Mandel are a match ""made in heaven"" but surely they could have covered other beautiful standards not previously recorded by her. I have all her recordings and would like her first album ""Embers and Ashes"" transfered to CD. That's the album that got me ""hooked"" and an avid fan ever since. Shirley, are you listening?..............Your #1 fan"
5,Spiritual Classic,Took this small unimposing book with me on retreat. It set the frame of mind for the entire weekend. Twenty years after his death Fulton Sheen is still the best spiritual advisor for the Roman Catholic in America.
3,One for two,"3 1/2Harkens back to a strange and unknown time when country music could also be synonymous with creative integrity, even if PR feels less alive."
2,Not quite custom fit!,"This mat, while it is made of nice quality carpet and is bound on the edges, does not fit my Yukon 2nd row seats well at all. It is simply a rectangular piece that should be 3"" longer on each end to reach the door sill, which is the area that gets the dirtiest!"
1,It's an age old story...,"Rolling Vengeance is an age old tale that loses nothing in this re-telling. Like the Icelandic Saga that inspired it, it's a ""boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-rolls-over-the-town-with-a-huge-monster-truck"" story.Well...Maybe *not* so much like an Icelandic Saga after all. You will, however, get to see Ned Beatty's nipples *without* hearing him squeal like a pig. What a treat! HUH?!?!Having said that, it's still better than Liquid Sky. (Worst acting, worst sets, worst plot... I take that back. Liquid Sky had no plot.)"
5,Missy Elliott the Queen of rap and Scary Spice,"Wow! Two great rappers together... Sounds scary! And they've made a great song. Melanie B is great rapper, but Missy Elliott is the woman that makes this song so great. Melanie B's solo-courier has started greatly and so has Melanie C's. Let's hooray for them!"
5,Hi Missy is da bomb.,"missy is da bomb she really knows how to rap,and if you don't think so you got no taste in music."
4,A Wonderful Book!,"I just received this pattern book, and I love it! I have been an avid crocheter for over 25 years and have seen lots of books. This one is well worth the price.Multiple pictures of each item helps you get a better idea of the entire project before you begin. I like that they show the project being worn by a cute kid as well as on its own. The materials list, patterns, and graphs are well written. Each pattern includes the stitches shown in symbols, a great way to see what are you going to do before you start work.The only negative (my usual pet peeve) is that they tell you exactly what yarn they used in the project, not a general description what type/weight yarn would work. I would prefer pattern books to first list the weight and type of yarn plus what was used in the picture. I want all the information in case the yarn that was picked doesn't come in a color I'd want to use.All in all, a great book and recommended.Enjoy!"
4,The lack of yarn detail makes it tough,"I really love the patterns in this book - they are modern and adorable. Which is a nice change from so many of the crochet books that show layette sets made with pastel acrylic yarn. However, when I read other reviews complaining about the lack of details of the yarn used I didn't think it was a big deal, I thought I could just search the internet and figure it out. It is not that easy - I had a really hard time finding a comparable yarn to Twilleys Lyscordet yarn. It would have been so much easier if yarn weights/size were included, instead of just saying, ""use comparable yarn"". Other than that I am very happy with the book."
1,"Stale, stale, stale","I love Bremner Wafers, but the crackers in these boxes are stale and rancid tasting. Unfortunately I didn't open the first box until it was too late to return them. I had checked the sell by date when they arrived last month, and they are supposed to be OK until September of this year, BUT they aren't. Very, very disappointing."
5,Bremner Wafers,We have a hard time finding these in local stores. We found the expiration date was much farther out when purchased online.
2,UPDATE THIS BOOK!,"Only I get better over time says my wife, but not this book. I just bought a new home and needed a general maintenance / project book. The basics of this book are pretty good. Layout is user friendly. Some repair basics never change. BUT...it was first published in 1986, introduced in the USA a few years later. Many illustrations of tools, parts, room design info are d-a-t-e-d. Books like these don't get better with time, they just make you fustrated. Time to MODERNIZE. The 2000 version (if there is one) will be a great ""How To..."" book for the new millenium. In the mean time, buy a newer ""How To..."" book, there lots of good alternitives listed with Amazon. Happy hunting!"
4,Useful at the high school level? Hardly!,"I found Jeffrey's Ian Ross' book very useful for my own research dealing with criminal regimes in Latin America, notably the Fujimori dictatorship of Peru, which I examined in a recent work. I use Ross' book when dealing with state crime in my criminology classes. I also regularly recommend the work to the gradute students from International Development Studies whom I supervise on state crime in developing societies. While Ross' book is ethnocentric his assumptions can easily be modified to analyze political crime beyond the so-called First World. I would therefore strongly disagree with the claim by a previous reviewer that the book is at best useful at the high school level. My major criticism would be that the author does not sufficiently distinguish between administrative and political corruption."
5,Easy Read,"A fair balance of recipes, product and eatery reviews with some dabbles into food and wine trends around the globe. I read a lot of heavy intellectual scholastic related stuff, so this is a nice entertaining casual read with great information, nice photos etc."
2,food and wine review,This is my 2nd. attempt to have issues of the magazine mailed to me. I like to read about both food and wine but most of the time the recipes and the wine choices don't fit in my budget.Sorry!
1,Food & Wine,I ordered this magazine on Nov. 20th and it is now Feb. 1st I have not even received anything. The same day I ordered this magazine I ordered another and I have already received 2 issues of that magazine. I am not impressed with the speed.
2,"Would F&W exist if ""Top Chef"" didn't?","I hung on to my subscription to F&W until just today, when I cancelled. They really should just rename it ""Top Chef Magazine"" and be done with it. Every issue now has the obligatory interview (or several) with a present/former Top Chef contestant, his or her ideas on what makes food tick or what they think the next trend will be, etc. If I cared at all what these people think I would watch the show. I don't care and I don't watch and I don't want to pay to have their opinions delivered to me every month. Although each issue does showcase new recipes and ideas (as well as wine & beer, of course) it's irritating to be constantly reminded of their connection with ""Top Chef."" While some readers may think this a great plus for the magazine, to me it's nothing more than heavy-handed advertising and just not worth the money."
4,Incredible Wine Pairings,"Okay my one and only complaint about this one is the ads in each issue it becomes so much that I get tired of having to search out the articles. The menus are delicious, the pictures are beautiful and the wine recommendations are broad in range from the inexpensive to the pricey. They seem to try and cover it all in their issues...."
1,Would be nice if it would come in the mail.....,"Still waiting to receive my first magazine....its been 6 weeks since I purchased my subscription, will update when I receive the magazine."
3,Really slow delivery,"I am using to seeing the disclaimers that a new subscription will take a certain amount of time to start, but ordering through amazon is the first time I have actually had it take as long as they said. You save a couple dollars, but be prepared to wait three issues past the current one before it starts - I order when the December issue was on newstands, and January and February are out already while nothing has been delivered to me."
1,"after weeks and weeks of waiting, I have yet to receive a magazine----what a joke","after weeks and weeks of waiting I have yet to receive a magazine,I ordered another magazine at the same time and have received 3 ofthat order already."
3,Not crazy about it,It took MONTHS before my first issue arrived. Lots of ads. Not as many recipes as I was hoping for. Won't renew.
2,Why did I subscribe?,"This is the second time I subscribed to this magazine. I did it knowingly that I didn't like the magazine the first time around because it was only $5. Well, it was a waste of $5.This magazine looks nice but most of the articles are not really relevant to a middle-class suburban mom-of-two like me. There aren't as many recipes as in other magazines, and seldom I find something that I really want to make (for reference, I usually cook recipes from epicurious.com). Once in a blue moon there is an article that I find interesting, but most of the time I just glance at the magazine and automatically put it on the recycling pile."
2,I Had Issues Even Getting It,"I ordered Food and Wine magazine on 6/21/10, even though they estimated I wouldn't get my first issue until August. Here it is, September 3rd and no magazine. They apparently kept pushing the Estimated Ship Date, now scheduled to arrive 9/8/10. I'm not holding my breath. I probably would have been better off getting my hands on a copy and going directly to the source. I've ordered many things through Amazon, however this will be my last magazine subscription."
4,Like it....have yet to find most of it practical,"I have been receiving this magazine for quite some time now. They do have some great ideas and I have tried many of the simpler recipes, but a lot of the recipes are more complicated than they let on when reading it and some of the ingredients are hard to find if you are not an experienced cooker. Same is true of following most of the recipes if you are not an avid cooker. But it leaves the desire to achieve more and reach for new things so I give it four stars"
4,Bought as gift.,Duaghter-in-law liked this subscription. When we visited she had made a recipe from this series and it was good. Probably would order it again for her.
4,Really enjoy it!,"A much more sophisticated class of material, but still easy to enjoy. Has a lot of great stories and food pairing ideas and recommendations. Check it out!"
2,A Trendy Disappointment,"Maybe I was just hoping for too much from one magazine - a good wine magazine with some recipies thrown in. The recipies are good, but the wine secion is a sparse and unsophisticated afterthought. The articles are truly grating, focusing in agonizing detail on the trendy parties thrown by the editors' friends. There is a place for a magazine like this, but don't let the name fool you; this publication is really more of an entertainment lifestyle magazine than a food magazine. What is most definitley is NOT is a wine magazine."
2,"Appropriate for the genre, I suppose. . .","My husband got me this magazine because he knows how I love to try new dishes and wines. Unfortunately, this magazine has a very different audience than what we expected. In any given issue I might find one or two recipes that catch my interest. The others are too ""food and wine snobby"" for me. In addition, the magazine tries to capture that jet set feeling by telling you all about Boston, New York and Napa Valley five star restaurants. As a working mom, I doubt that I'll be able to try them in the near future. In general, this one reminds me of the magazines you get at the airlines."
2,"Good only for those who want a really, really light read.","Magazine consists mostly of the disconnected factoids, print infomercials, and recipes (to be fair, some very good) that can be had for free on the web. Anyone truly serious and curious cooking and wines should look elsewhere."
3,A bit on the high end side for ideas,"My wife subscribes to just about every food magazine that there is from Food Network, to Rachel Ray to Better Home and Gardens. Not a week goes by that she is not clipping new receipes. Food and Wine is our newest subscription and my first opinion is that it is more of a high end / refined taste buds with more of elaborate meal planned than say a quick meal from Rachel Ray. The pictures that accompny the receipes and stories are of the highest class and this magazine would be a great add to a coffee table or waiting room. There are also stories about restraunts and vacations that center around eating. I feel that the wine part of the magazine takes a back page to the food and would like to see more wine reviews (similar to wine spectator). All in all buy this magazine to look at and read but if you are just a regular guy with normal tastes this magazine is not that practical."
2,Okay Magazine... but way too many advertisements!,"The accounts in Food & Wine are fun to read, and I've gotten many great recipes from the magazine. However, I do have one major qualm with it: the advertisement to recipe ratio, is aggravating. When I get a cooking magazine, I expect recipes, not ads galore. Besides that, it is a fine magazine, but I would recommend something like Cooks Country (my favorite-the recipes are delicious, the tips helpful, the accounts of how the recipes came to be entertaining, and the format both attractive and easy to follow) instead. Taste of Home is also a good choice."
1,Too bored to go on,"I'm sad to say this novel is nothing like book one. I'm only halfway done and I can't drag myself through another page. The plot is so slow with endless recapping of political strategy. Where is the adventure? Really, where is any action?I regret this purchase. I was fooled by the suspenseful back cover description and the positive reviews. Maybe the rest of the series is better, but this one didn't captivate me in the least."
2,Borning Political Intrigue,I enjoyed the Thief but got halfway through Queen of Attolia and just couldn't take it anymore. I love books where I can get to know the characters and this story is mostly about the political positions of the countries and a little bit about the characters. Won't be continuing the series.
1,Too many Books- too little time to waste on this book,"I'm sure there is some redeeming value in this book, but I'm not sure what it is. I purchased the ""Thief"", the ""Queen"", and the ""King"" at the same time and after reading this book I returned the ""King"". I just didn't want to spend anymore of my time on this series. I enjoyed the ""Thief"", but as I read this I kept thinking the book would pick up. It just didn't. I liked Gen, enjoyed a few other characters, but the story line was painful. One country was fighting against another country, then they would change sides, you needed a score card to keep up. I normally keep books I enjoy and reread them at a later date, but books one & two went immediately to Goodwill. I couldn't have disliked this book anymore. (I enjoyed the Thief, but not enough to reread it again.)"
2,Disappointing as a sequel,"The Thief was an imaginative adventure and I was hoping that its sequel would follow in the same vein. The Queen of Attolia went in a completely different dirction, both stylistically and in the plot. This book was more political than character-based and if I didn't already know the characters from The Thief, it would have been completely forgettable. To be frank, it kind of ruined The Thief a little bit just because the events afterwards are so dreary and Gen's life is so crappy and dark."
2,Great story but a little unsettling,"The age difference between Eugenides and Attolia reminds me of Mary Kay Letourneau and Vili Faulauu. Also, I'm sick and tired of Gen being locked up all the time. He's a thief for goodness sake, let him show it!"
4,A surprisingly rich story,"Wow, this little book really surprised me. It ended up being WAY BETTER than I expected when i began reading. The beginning was sort of bland and formulaic but about a third of the way in, things began to get interesting, and the last third was brilliant. Very fully-fleshed, interesting, unique characters. Extremely complex political intrigues and wars and treaties and strategy. My only real complaint was that this book did not contain a map. I found myself often flipping to the beginning in search of the non-existent map. Normally I could care less about such things, but the political and geographical realms were so intricate, I'd have appreciated a visual aid. Still, a very interesting and enjoyable (and fast) read."
4,Wonderfully Interesting,"The Queen of Attolia is a wonderfully interesting book. Its characters are easy to love (or hate). The detailed description is impressive, and brings you right into the story. The plot in itself is incredible; and even though the main character literally wallows in self pity for several chapters, it never becomes boring. It does become a tad depressing between the main character's cut-off hand and the war his country is fighting, but is always revived by pieces of humor and the good-nature of its characters. If I were to judge, I would have to say that this author's greatest strength is in her endings. They are very surprising but not unrealistic, and when you think about it, you can tell that the author was hinting at the end the whole time.This book would be best for upper middle-school aged kids. Slight language, romance, and general fantasy nonsense is involved, but not enough for over-concerned parents to worry about."
2,Disappointment,"I've recommended the first book about Gen, ""The Thief,"" to countless students, and I loved it myself. I'm not going to recommend the sequel! The plotting is certainly ingenious, and Gen's twisty imagination and clever talk are equally pleasing, but there are many minuses. One of the characters introduced in the first book is merely dismissed as ""away studying"" or some such, and is mentioned no more. A more serious objection is a psychological one. The end of the book is totally unbelievable, given what we know about Gen's opinions from the first book, and also from the tense and suspenseful beginning chapters of this book. Also, in the first book, the author chose to show us the people of her imaginary countries through the stories they tell. She attempts only half-heartedly to continue in her second story; only one ""tale"" is told.I wish I hadn't read it; I won't enjoy re-reading the first one as much, knowing what lies in store for the characters!"
2,"Show, don't tell! Too little time with main character.","I loved The Thief-- we were completely inside his point of view, and he was funny and clever. I couldn't wait to read this sequel.But in the sequel, the author goes on for pages and pages about the politics of the countries involved. She tells us about wars and stuff... it's like reading a history book and I frankly had trouble following it. Scenes that actually have Gen in them are rare, and when we do see him a lot of the time he's just acting whiny and other characters are concerned about him. It goes on for pages and pages and it gets old.There are rare moments when Gen actually pops into the story and does something, and those are delightful-- the only reason I'm giving the book two stars instead of one."
1,Boring mumbo jumbo,"Saul Bellow is a good writer, but the character he writes about is boring, self centered and prone to long rants of ""word salad"" tangents. I had to read this book for my book club, and it was painful!"
2,I want..I want..I want an explanation.,"While this book is obviously well written, to me its a long ride to nowhere. Not much actually happens in the book, and the senseless ramblings between the King and Henderson are all rehashes of the same old 'meaning of life' sayings.The book was a bit of a chore to get through, with little payoff at the end."
3,Henderson the Blowhard,"The grade reflects my enjoyment rather than the underlying value of this book, which is reputedly a major work by a Nobelist that may well say important things about nineteen-fifties America naively throwing its weight around in the developing world. But I find the title character, a fiftyish millionaire, to be a boor and a blowhard, despite his odd scraps of knowledge and unexpected areas of competence. Yes, he could be a fine comic character if you happen to like him (and you should know after a chapter or so), but I personally resent spending that amount of time with his discursive reflections. And the African country to which he journeys (taking half the book to get there) is as artificial a construct as the locale of Rider Haggard'sSHE, so that the improbably eloquent English-speaking King Dahfu who engages Henderson in long philosophical discussions emerges as little more than the author's surrogate."
2,so-so,"There's one aspect of this book that I found delightful: Bellow apparently did zero research -- ZERO! -- before setting his novel in Africa. He didn't bother to find out the names of tribes, languages, features of the geography, etc., before sitting down to write. Not that this is a fantastic Africa; it's just that it's an Africa as Saul Bellow thought it could have been.I found this to be a wonderful and inspiring approach. I find it a bit sad that our age is so caught up with historical accuracy. The pressure to provide it can frequently stifle an artist's creativity.So Bellow here is unapologetically a novelist, not a cultural anthropologist, almost in a passive-agressive way.However, I didn't think there was much else of interest to the book."
4,bizarre and ironically touching,"Henderson is a ""noble"" by birth in that he's rich, but he lives like a pig and with pigs and going to africa brings out his virtues in the most ugly ways to exalt him to the highest pinnacle of his abilities. The experience which wakes his sleeping soul, allows him to return to the west a new man with new ambitions. In the meantime, the book can be quite silly, but Henderson is an interesting character, something like a Gulliver or Oddysseus (more like Leopold Bloom, though). He's adventurous to a strong pain. Bellow is a great writer at times his prose just turns the most silly situations into interesting points of reflection. I like the way the book is not about symbolism or metaphor unless it is overt and almost mocking. Occasionally the book gets tedious. Although I liked the book, I don't know where it got it's classic status. It doesn't seem to be anything groundbreaking, just a humourous, well-written novel."
3,Capacity for greatness,"Although I did not loathe this book, neither did I love it. The prose is fair, even brilliant at times, but the main character is ...well, a jerk. It is very hard to watch a jerk go through what is supposed to be a spiritual awakening, when, in the end, he just seems like... a sentimental jerk.There is alot of talk from Bellows about Henderson's capacity for deep feelings: great joy, great sorrow...a capacity in his soul for greatness. But where is it? True, we can't get into Henderson's mind, but Henderson seems more a sentimental fool than a lost romantic...sort of a strange mixture of King Lear and his fool. The intriguing people in the book and the secondary characters who surround Henderson. Henderson himself is capricious, overbearing, and well...stupid. I'm hesitant to read more of Bellow's books after this one. Great ideas...slightly pathetic execution."
5,A must read for everyone,This book should was great from start to finish. I would definitely recommend it. Bellow does a great job throughout. Henderson is the most interesting literary character I have encountered thus far. He is great because he can relate to anyone and everyone. Pick this up soon!!!
3,Worth reading,I enjoyed the beginning of this book. It really grabbed me. I wanted to read it now! But as I got further into the book I became more curious rather than driven. I was curious as to how Henderson would evolve. For some reason I was pleased with this evolution but not deeply stirred. I plan to read more of Saul Bellow. I like the way he uses language.
2,Mildly humorous but not really worth it,"Henderson is a big rich idiot. Having got everything he ever wanted through his life because of his riches, he seeks to find fulfillment by going to Africa. As he says,""...it's the destiny of my generation of Americans to go out in the world and try to find the wisdom of life."" All he really does is try to accomplish something big to make himself feel better. He doesn't really know what he wants and doesn't figure it out. I wish he was eaten by alion at the end so he wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. The African characters are ridiculously idealized. The prose, however, is vivid. Even though it is not very difficult reading, I found myself losing interest frequently throughout. It's not utter trash, but I can't recommend this book."
3,Henderson The Rain King,I was diappointed that this audio book would not work inside my car DVD player.I had to play it on my computer. The main reason I order on line with Amazon is tohear the book while driving my car during long trips which are usually long hauls.
2,Not for somebody with a short attention span,"I really didn't like this book. It's very long and wordy, and it describes things of no importants. Henderson goes off in long stories that mean nothing, and then expects people to remember what he was talking about in the first place. I guess if you like books that have first person narratives and long stories, you'd like it. But if you want action and suspense, this is NOT the book for you."
1,"ludicrous, absurd, pretentious, ""deep thoughts"" without any","If this is one of the best 100 novels of the 20th century, Lord preserve us from the worst 100! There isn't a single believable character - the dialogue is simply unbelievable. The situation is farcical withour being a bit funny. The motivation of the protagionist is couched in the most obscure gobblegook. At every page, my reaction was, what nonsense."
1,Don't buy it,My wifes navigator broke and the wheels fell off and she fell and hurt her self badly. They are very unsafe and I do not recommend it to anyone. The wheel fell off twice and i had to drill it out and put new better hardware on it. Then before I trashed it the other wheel literally busted in the middle nad collapsed and almost tossed her out again. The company had us sign a release with the promise of a replacement transport chair but did not ever honor their offer.The company scammed us and would not replace the chair. Do not buy or deal with that company or buy this unsafe chair for you will regret it.
1,bad surprise,The music is great !BUTI don't know the reason why : the CD was factory (?) sealed`BUT There are many bad scractches on the CD itselfUntil now the laser beam is going through those scratches nicelyBUT until when ?I don't know what to do ...MerciDomCravic
2,waste of money,I have this and had to modify it for my Saiga 332... modding it was easy but its very uncomfortable and doesnt look that great in my opinion. It was on my gun for all of 15 minutes before i tosse the stock foregrip back on.
4,"Very good buy for the money, some filing required for flush fit","I installed this Galil style handguard on my SAR-1, and had to do a bit of filing/custom fitting to make it flush and tight. Nothing major, but when trying to fit the hand guard to my rifle right out of the box, the gas tube would not line up due bowing of the polymer caused the guard being a bit too long to properly fit behind the hand guard retention ring. All in all, I think with Tapco you are getting a decent product at a excellent price point. Very happy with my purchase, and would recommend to anyone out there, so long as you don't mind a little filing."
2,Not what I expected,"I don't feel this product was described well, the seller should fix that. I read the ad as being 6 cones, since 6 was in the title and coneS was in the description. Imagine my dumbfoundedness when I opened the shipping box to see one single 6"" cone. It does not have a black base as the ad described either. It is good thick quality though! Hmm, now what to do with one single tiny come?The 2-star is only for the poor ad description. If it's what I was looking for I'd give it a 5-star for it's quality."
5,What you see is what you get and that isn't always bad!,"A welcome addition, once I painted it. Adds fun to the set and when placed in a 'forested' section it is a fun discovery for others viewing my train set."
4,Review for FlexiSkin for the Cingular 3125,"There is one problem with this particular cover for this phone. As is, the phone won't close completely. This causes the screen light to stay on. This can be fixed by cutting a strip (approx. 1/4 inch) off the screen side of either piece. I cut it off the top piece, but wish I had cut it off the bottom. The top piece of mine slides around, but I think it wouldn't have or at least not as much if I had cut the strip form the bottom piece. The bottom piece is nice and snug. It's great for what I needed which was something to hold the battery cover in place. It would also be great for people like my dad who very hard on their phones."
4,"Powerful, human story of a father and a 'challenged' son","This could have been sentimental dreck in Hollywood - a father who abandoned his handicapped son comes back to help care for him.But in Amelio's neo-realist hands, while it does have a handful of over-the-top moments, its more than redeemed by other, powerfully sad moments that acknowledge just how hard caring for a disabled child can be. There are a few logic holes in the plot, but the acting is terrific, and when the film gets unflinchingly honest at key moments, it earns the heartbreak it causes."
4,Great Gothic,"Loved this Gothic tale of an alchemist who invents a way to live for ever, then later realizes it is a curse. Lots of dark castles in Eastern Europe, Spain and other ""mysterious"" places with references to real people and events from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Good writing, clever unpredicatble plot."
5,Dang that was good,"Now this isnt your run of the mill Anime, its deeper that that. A little suggestive of sexual parts, so maturity is required..."
2,Not what I thought it was cracked out to be,"Sure the animation was top notch but I really didn't think the dumbfounded feeling of Chi made this cliche of a science fiction topic any better. If you wanted to watch this for the sense of a kawaii feeling then it was a good pick, but if you wanted a more serious robotic animation then you should turn around and buy something else. The feeling that Chi has for her master were drug out to the last minute where it was kind of too late to even form a sense of opinion towards them as a ""couple"". If you like the love of a robot in something you watch this may be one for you but if you see that it is pointless to show a romance between a human and robot then you should turn away before you get dragged into buying a item that costs 20$-30$ of wasted money."
1,BOOTLEG DVD'S,"DO NOT BUY, THIS IS A PIRATED SET.What you are looking at is a Hong Kong bootleg of the Chobits DVD collection. This means poor picture quality, and a mangled English translation (they translate it into Cantonese from Japanese, and then Cantonese into English)."
5,This is what Im talking about,"Awsome anime. I may be a guy but I still like a quote ""chick flick"", even more so since its still anime. The love story here is top notch, grade A, premium choice. Sadly it left me wanting more, but thats just how I am, the ending was great. Yet I still want more, sorta an after story as it were. Well all in all its one of the best."
5,Chobits: The Complete Series,"It came very quickly, and it came with exactly what I wanted and with everything else that was with it."
2,Little deviant,"Be certain that the anime adaptation of Chobits is a total let down, primarily due to its deviation from the original storyline to a point where it's almost offensive. It's littered with filler and recap episodes, and offers a nearly meaningless ending.*THE GRAPHIC NOVELS ARE EXCELLENT HOWEVER. I STRONGLY URGE THE BUYER TO INSTEAD READ THE MANGA, AS OPPOSED TO WATCHING THE ANIME.Chobits (as more clearly seen in the manga) proposes that the idea of machines being created in the image of man is not much different to the idea of men being created in the image of God, and so these machines should own the right to exercise the same privileges and liberties human beings do. It was refreshing to see love redefined as a state of mind that is above fleshly desires as well. It is, without exaggeration, a beautiful series, and a personal favorite.Genre: Romance, Science Fiction, Comedy, EcchiSet in the near future, very much like modern JapanContains All Episodes, including Special Episodes"
1,BAD!,"It's not blu-ray quality at all! They are DVD quality on blu-ray disks. Only thing that is crisp is English subtitle. The resolution is 1080i and audio is 2.0 for both English and Japanese.I am very disappointed and sorry that I have to rate one star for such a great series from Clamp.Update: I don't understand why people are giving bad ratings on reviews that talk about bad video quality on blu-ray version, but they will be sorry when they buy the blu-ray version. If you are looking for DVD version, please do not rate this review. Otherwise you might be ruining the decision makings of those who look for ""blu-ray quality"" blu-ray version."
1,Typical...,"... I finally watched this anime after hemming and hawing for months... I wish that I had continued my resistance. The characters were typical; the story line, boringly predictable; and, the end wasn't near enough to the beginning for me. Definitely one of THOSE that I've worked actively to avoid. Tooooo cute saccharine females bordering on stupid. Exploitative and insulting to women. Odd, poorly socialized wishy washy male hero complete with nose bleeds but at least he comes right out and says the word ""porn"" when in the throes of his repressed sexuality that he can only express with a robot... eventually. UGH!! If I could give it no stars I would."
2,chobits,i dont know if i can call this a must see but i like the sci-fi part of with chi but the drama was bad as you see a older guy and i mead older in an relationship with teenage girl the man who works an the baker shop in american this is unlawfulland next is the one with the teacher who is covering up a relationship with a student and went to another student room and stayed all nite in american she wouldbe lock up this amine is perverbed and bad for anyone in their right mind if you call sex predator drama check yourself. this show dont need to put older and teenage girl together to but good or young men and teacher which is a bad combonation. thinks
4,Yup,"I liked the anime so therefore I liked the dvd set. Thankfully they weren't some grainy quality. Overall, it's a good buy."
5,Great Video,Really cute and must have for a serious anime collector. Go with the DVD as there aren't any extra features on the Blue Ray.
5,a must watch,why its humorous yet serious and quite satisfying never met anyone who hasn't heard of and not liked chobits for the blu ray price its a noteworthy buy im glad i got it too add to my collection. those of you who love anime and looking for a relationship anime to watch with a girl or your man this is perfect. you wont be disappointed with this purchase here.
4,"Cooks well, keeps food moist, but...","Received this for Christmas and used it for the first time the other day. We ended up smoking some chicken breasts, which came out with great flavor and very moist, but it left my house smelling like smoke for a few hours. Some of the reviews I read said it left their house smelling pleasantly like the scent of smoked meat...I found that it left the house smelling like burnt campfire wood, and not exactly in a good way. The product itself smokes food well, and I will use it again, I will just probably use it on my outdoor gas grill instead of my stovetop."
5,great,"ehat a great product! my daughter had one, and what i saw that she could do with it, i knew i had to have one. i even smoked a rack of ribs ( cut to fit) and the were fabulous! kudos for this product."
3,Beware of Glass top stove,"We used our stovetop cooker one time and it cracked the porcelian stovetop and also cracked the smoker which we promptly trashed. There should be a huge warning label on this product to inform you about the hazards, not a little disclaimer."
4,outsourced construction needs quality control,"First off, I love what I can do w/ this smoker. Killer for fish, great ribs, can't wait to try many other things. IT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR A BARBECUE GRILL. That being said, it has it's uses, and does a fine job.My problem has been the ""made in China"" aspect. The first one I received, the handle bracket was attached crooked, and the handle would not stay snugged up against side of pan, flopped off at some angle. Returned that one and received a second, almost worse than the first. Called the company (Cameron Cookware) and advised them of the problem. THEY sent me another, but I must say even this one is not right. But I give up, I want the pan badly enough I'm going to keep it. I must commend Cameron for their effort to make things right tho."
5,Great!,"I received my item very promptly, the next day! That is unbelievable! I can't wait to give this as a gift and hear how it worked out."
3,Great Gizmo!!!,"Only had it three weeks but has changed our eating habits. Chicken breasts and inexpensive pork cuts have turned out great. Really, Really love the veggies. Zuccini, peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, garlic, tofu, mushrooms, and onions all have a new taste when smoked. We do up 4 or 5 batches for the week and eat them in place of potatoes. Not a lot of smoke in the house especially after tweaking the lid. Recommend buying ""Smokin'"" by Christopher Styler for great basic tips and recipes. Really like spending weekend afternoon quality time with this smoker."
2,Glass cooktop breakage with stovetop smoker,"I used the smoker with good results the first time, unfortunately the second time it caused a huge crack in the glass cooktop. The estimate cost to replace the top will be over $300. My recommendation is NOT to use the stove top smoker on any glass cooktops. I will use my smoker from now on outside on the gas gril."
5,great product,I made dinner for two friends using the smoker and both immediately ordered one for their husbands.
2,Hey - Take it outside!,"I bought this because I vaguely remembered Emeril using something similar on his TV show. I forgot that his ""set"" had a big industrial exhaust fan over the stove that blew fumes out into the city. I have a ""builder's standard"" oven hood, like 99% of Americans that blasts the exhaust right back into the room. Using this smoker on a stovetop inside your house is not unlike lighting a campfire on your living room carpet and then puttng it out with wet hickory-soaked blankets. You probably don't have enough windows to open to clear the stink in a reasonable amount of time. After 3 days, I'm considering pulling down the drapes and dragging the furniture to the curb. I've already taken all our reeking clothes to the incinerator.I suggest you buy this along with a hotplate and restrict it to backyard usage only. Enjoy."
4,smoker,"works great,but smokes a little to much.tried to ""adjust"" as per instructions but not much help,other than that i smoked some ribs and they were great!cleanup not so easy but o.k.next time will try aluminum foil on bottom."
2,The food comes out steamed!!,"I am deeply disapointed from the smoer, the liquids from the meat are causing the food to be steamed insead of BBQ kind of smokey. The taste is good, so I will try to improve my cooking techniques for better results."
2,Steamed Food,"I have used this twice already for burgers and each time the burgers are steamed rather than grilled. I don't like steamed burgers. I also taste very little smoke flavor even though it makes my house smell strongly of hickory smoke, which I don't mind because I like the way hickory smells. I just wish I could get that strong hickory flavor imparted on the food. This will only be good for veggies, it's not suitable for meats, I will have to drag my mini charcoal Weber grill out for meats like I've been doing all along.I don't recommend."
3,Know what you want to do,"This smoker works as advertised. With appropriate care and attention, you can easily smoke a wide variety of foods and ingredients. At the right temperature, the small leakage of smoke from the unit is not a problem.However, recognize that this is a HOT smoker. If you are looking to smoke meats and other ingredients for long-term preservation, this is not the unit to use. Because of its small size, with the heat turned high enough to produce adequate smoke, you will easily reach temperatures of 250-300 degrees inside the pan, hot enough to roast many meats and birds. Fresh ham slices, for example, while infusing a wonderful flavor from the smoke, will cook to well done and beyond if you're not careful. Certainly far beyond where I would want to cook them for use in bean and soup dishes."
4,Good for indoors but no comparison to outdoor smoker,"This is a nice product for those of us who aren't fortunate enough to have a backyard grill and want to add a lite smoke flavor to the foods we cook. However, if you've ever used a real outdoor smoker, don't expecting results anywhere near as good.Also, the smoker I got seemed to leak quite a bit. I followed the directions about adjusting the lid but it didn't help. What I did to fix the problem was to take a pair of pliers and clamp down on the runners/guides of the lid to make a tighter seal. This helped quite a bit but I wouldn't recommend it unless you know you're going to keep your smoker as it left marks."
4,Delivers as promised. Great product.,"I found this to be a quality product, although it did require ""the tweak"" (described in the accompanying manual) before use. Basically the steel can bend a little in shipping and you have to give it a very minor nudge back into shape. No problem. The food it creates is fantastic, and I'm already ordering a new stock of wood chips less than a month later, since I've been using it consistently several times per week. Easy to use, easy to clean! So far I've smoked burgers, pork tenderloin, chicken, turkey, and sausages all with great success, and am looking forward to smoking some tuna steaks in the near future.The only downside for me is that it doesn't work on my stovetop. I have one of the flat glass cooktops and it doesn't heat evenly--the first time I ended up with rare chicken (gross!) Since then, however, I have just dropped it on the lowest rack of a 425 degree oven and gotten beautiful results. Great smoke flavor, great price, great product."
2,REALLY small!,"I was very excited to receive my smoker. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered I couldn't fit the meat into the pan! I cut a small portion from my brisket and put it in, but the juice from it swamped the chips and I finally gave up after cleaning out the pan and putting fresh chips in three times. This is probably good for two small chicken breasts or a small fish fillet, but don't expect to do anything more with it, and don't use the fattier, juicier cuts that would normally be put in a smoker or your chips will be totally soaked."
5,Easy to use and it works!,"I have to admit that when I read that the smoker works with less than two T. of wood shavings I had some doubts. However, I followed the directions and wow, it really worked well. My family loves pork ribs and I normally slow roast them in the oven. They are always yummy but I couldn't duplicate the smoky taste we all love until now.I covered the ribs with a dry rub and placed them on the rack, using hickory chips. After 15 minutes I removed the ribs and placed then in a baking dish with my steaming liquid (1/2 can of DP), and 2 1/2 hours later we were eating smoky, sweet, and spicy ribs. Clean up was a breeze (I placed foil over the drip tray and sprayed with rack with oil); just understand that your house will smell like you have the fireplace going...not a bad thing! I highly recommend this product!"
4,great indoor smoker,"I have used this product to smoke fish,pork an a whole chicken, with great results. It is smokeless and the food is great. It is such a good price that I am sending one to my nephew. The only problem is the cleanup. I suggest you use foil whenever you're able."
1,Good while it lasted,"I was very impressed with my smoker for the first 6 months that I had it. Minimal fuss and easy cleanup. While the smoking wasn't as good as an outdoor smoker, it seemed to do the trick.However, after 6 months I put some water in it after it had cooled down , and found I had about a dozen cracks in the bottom of the pan causing the water to leak out. I followed the directions to the letter, yet this stainless steel pan which the manufaturer claims will ""last for years"" was done after 6 months. $60 flushed down the drain. I wouldn't recomend this to anybody. Unfortunately I gave one as a gift also. Waiting to hear how long that one lasted."
5,Great item,"I have had mine since fall 2006, with a selection of all kinds of chips. I love it and use it for meats and vegetables a lot.It is well made and easy to use, even with large items. For those, I tent the pan with foil and proceed as I would with my outdoor smoker.I would certainly recommend this product for people who don't have room for a regular outdoor smoker."
5,"Easy, dependable and very well built !","I LOVE my smoker ! It allows me to provide an exceptional meal every time, whether I want minimal or maximum smoke flavor. Every serious cook should own one !"
3,smoker,"I have not used this product yet, but it is very heavy and lots of wood chips came with it. I am looking forward to having the time to fool with it."
5,Fear of smoking.,"One week after I purchased a stovetop smoker, Cooks Illustrated reviewed them in their magazine, and on their website. They said that their industrial strength ventilation hoods couldn't handle the smoke, and they recommended that anyone using one, take the batteries out of their smoke alarm.I'm a big fan of Cook's Illustrated, but that simply isn't so. The smell of smoke, lingered in my kitchen and house for quite some time, but there was little, if any actual smoke. And, my smoke detector which sometimes goes off when I boil water, did not notice anything alarming.Plus you can use it outside on your grill! I think CI didsome damage to the folks at Cameron,as I'm afraid people will read the bad advice in the article, and miss out on the fun I'm having."
4,Pretty nice if you live in an apartment,"No question, if I had a yard I'd have a nice smoker outside. But I live in an apartment and don't have a yard, so this is a pretty good substitute. I've had it a few months now and tried ribs, chicken, fish, tofu, turkey breast, sausage and even a whole brisket. Everything came out well, most of really good, though initially I cooked things too long. But the taste is better than I would have expected. My only problem is adjusting the lid to keep it from leaking smoke, which seems to be an ongoing job. Most of the time I just cover it with heavy duty foil. My only advice would be to order extra wood chips, which you surely will want, directly from Camerons. Ordering them here they don't come from Amazon and the company that sends them has what I consider excessive shipping charges. Camerons charges less. Oh, yea, one nice side effect of using the smoker - my apartment smells like a fine barbecue restaurant."
5,If you love smoked foods you will love this smoker.,"I was a little skeptical at first, but my Cameron smoker is a great addition to my cooking routine. I've only used the hickory wood chips so far, but have made wonderful meats (brisket, ribs) on the top of the stove, then finished on the grill..a great alternative over the summer. It's durable, heavy weight and of good quality...highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys smoked foods."
4,Smoking made easy,"I have a co-worker who had recently purchased this item and she raved about it. Because of this I decided to buy one for my husband, who would normally do the cooking. After receiving the item he could not figure why I would buy something like this when we use our charcoal grill for everything. The first night I used the smoker for Salmon and new red pototoes and they were wonderful! Even my husband decided this was a great idea because of the convenience of staying indoors and cooking on those cold nights and the taste was perfect. If you like a heavier smoke taste it is easily adjusted. The clean up is a breeze and there is little smoke released into the house. If you are considering a smoker this is the way to go. There is such a variety of items which can be smoked you would be surprised."
5,Burgers in my apartment,"As an aparment dweller, this cookware is wonderful. I've used it for burgers and chicken thighs. It works nicely. No smoke in the house and the food was wonderful. This model works great for one to two people or if you don't mind cooking in batches. For more people, get the larger model, which fits on two burners."
5,Easy,"Was a little concerned when I ordered this item, but all that has changed. It is terrific. Also, liked the samples of ""wood"" that came with it. Much easier to use than what I had expected and cleanup is fast. If you are looking for a small smoker to use in the kitchen, fireplace or any place else, I highly recommend this one. The price is right too."
2,smoker's hell,"This sounds like a good idea, and indeed, it does smoke foods pleasantly with no trouble. I have now used it three times and probably will not use it again. The smoke odor is pervasive and over time is very unpleasant. It lasts for a day or two, with a faint odor for a third day. I was running two exhaust fans tonight while using it, and had a window open to see if that would make the fans more functional. Not very helpful. So I can't recommend this stovetop mini-smoker."
2,poor craftsmanship,"Just received my Cameron Smoker and used it for the first time. It was obvious that the lid was not a good fit. Smoke readily exited the corners filling the kitchen. I tried putting heavy pots on the ends to weight the corners down. No success. The intstructions made mention of ""tweaking"" the lid by bending it when ""half on"" the smoker. This still didn't help. To look at the lid ""on-edge"" gave the appearance of it being warped. The Cameron product line is listed as being in Colorado(?) but the packaging has the smoker as being made in China. It just doesn't appear to have ""tight"" production specifications. I am still looking for a stovetop smoker."
5,Fabulous smoked salmon in 25 minutes on my stovetop,"Who would have believed that I would be able to produce fabulous smoked salmon in 25 minutes on my stovetop. I marinate the salmon in soy sauce for 30 minutes, and smoke it using the alder wood chips. Everybody that's tasted it has loved it."
3,Stovetop Smoker,"3 stars because the edges of the cover are a bit sharp. However, perfect for smoking foods for 2!"
4,One of their best...,"Unmasked and reborn,the new Kiss in the eighties decided to beef up their sound with an ear to their ability to write great hooks;'Lick It Up'is a prime example of that,being the next level for this legendary band."
2,Another 80s Style,"Totally Forgettable release.The very fact that the Japanese release had the Makeup cover speaks for itself. Its really another filler Album. Just ask yourself, how much of this material is in the bands later setlist ( as stilted as that list is).I have the Disc, like I usually say, Any KISS is good KISS. But the fun is more in the having the KISS stuff than enjoying the sound. When I do my compilation discs for my own play, there is nothing memorable here. Sad, but true that this is not a KISS album, but it may be a rock album. However, it is such a truism that KISS is in the show, and so very little, basically nothing, is evocative of the shows, even of the ANIMALIZE material ( recorded on Video tape). Another wasted chance for KISS to be *KISS*."
5,No make-up required for a great album,"There are 2 remarkable non-make-up albums for KISS: Revenge and Lick It Up. Lick It Up is a must have album because it takes KISS from a pop rock sound to a heavy metal sound. Check "" A Million to One"" for a poweful metal ballad with heartbreaking lyrics only seen in ""Creatures of the Night's 'Still Love You'"".Vincent contributions is key to the metal turn but the rest of the band played their greatest effort since ""Dinasty"" as to create an album that ended up taking KISS to a new musical dimension."
3,Vinnie Vincent Era KISS,"Surprisingly worthwhile 80s effort by KISS. They still play the title track in live shows today. This is with the makeup off. Again produced by Michael Jackson. Vinnie Vincent is a fine guitarist. But, it's nothing special. Key tracks are: Exciter, Lick It Up, Not for the Innocent, A Million to One and And on the 8th Day. If you're a fan of KISS, by all means pick it up."
2,So that's what they look like...,"Compared to ""Kiss,"" ""Destroyer,"" ""Dressed to Kill,"" ""Love Gun,"" and any other great album before ""Creatures of the night,"" this album pales. Compared to any album after it, and before ""Revenge,"" it's ok."
3,Their heaviest album,"Kiss was the first band I got into when I was very young in the late '70s. I've almost heard all of their albums, and must say that Lick it Up is their best and heaviest. I have heard that Creatures of the Night is, but it doesn't sound like it to me. Lick it Up sports a tight production, good songs, and a heavy edge to it. Not to mention Vinnie Vincent had a hand in this being a good album. He's a great songwriter and rhythm guitarist. Their heaviest and best."
1,colonialism perpetuated,"Upon finding this book in the multi-cultural/lingual classroom that I work in, I was horrified to see a small caucasian girl tasting the fruit of the labor of those different people that brought the orange to her. The limits of those of a certain race to certain jobs is extraordinarily offensive, and I cannot see the benefit of reading this wordy and prejudiced story. A child wants to imagine themselves in each part of a story, and only too early are we saying that those who speak Spanish will only be planters, and those who are speaking Creole will be migrant fruit pickers. Sad."
1,not my idea of being multicultural,"Although I see the author's point of showing how everyone of different culturals all work together for one established goal, this book comes out more stereotipical than multicultural."
4,An Unbelievably Tragic Story,"The Wreck of the Medusa (The Tragic Story of the Death Raft), by Alexander McKee, has been reissued to benefit from the recent interest in survival stories, whether in the Artic regions, high atop a mountain, or on the high seas. This addition to the genre may not be as well written and researched as some (In the Heart of the Sea sets a high standard for going beyond simply the events of the tragedy and taking the reader into the context) but this book makes up for any faults by telling one of the most horrific stories imaginable. It begins with gross incompetence by the leaders of the expedition and then becomes a story of murder, mutiny, suicide, cannibalism and the very occasional act of heroism. It is stunning to see a raft (appropriately referred to as a death raft) go from one hundred and fifty to fifteen people in a couple of weeks. It is a gripping tale for those readers who have developed a taste for these rather gruesomely riveting survival tales."
2,Not Bad but I wish it could have been better,"Truly amazing story of abandonment, death and survival. This was a fair read but far from being a book I just couldn't put down. There were areas where I wished for more detail and information and there were items of information that were completely uneeded. Overall I gave it a three. It's a good book if you can't find anything else to read. A chronicle of true stupidy at work on the ocean, with over three dozen different names of people to keep track of. Don't spend too much for a copy of this book."
3,Choppy Narrative,"Overall I liked the book and found the subject matter very interesting. But, I found the writing and flow of the book a bit choppy. It jumped around a bit too much for my liking."
2,For Slim PDAs Only,"This PDA Case is attractive and professional; however, space is limited. My PDA was too big at 3.25 x 5 x .75 inches. The case features space for only one pen. It offers an extra stylus pen, but I could not remove it from its holder. Each cardholder houses 2-3 cards. Checkbook doesn't fit well. Seems better suited to PalmPilot-sized PDAs, if PDAs fit well in it at all."
3,New Handspring user,"Very nice case, good quality construction, looks good. Not large enough to carry a checkbook and handspring at the same time. Probably works best with small pda like Palm V. Security rail feature for use with the Palm V looks really neat, it looks like a stylus sewn into the case and you can slide into the PDA stylus slot so you don't have to use velcro to secure into case."
1,TO CRANKY REVIEWER,"(this is not a review) hey CRANKY REVIEWER i was intrigued by a review you wrote for a pink floyd album comparing it to britney spears so i read all the other reviews you've written. i'm trying to figure out if you are serious or if you wrote most of the reviews as a joke. if they are jokes then props, you're clever. if not.. well.. i don't really know what to say. if you read this then post back, i really want to know if your reviews are serious or not, you have sparked my curiosity."
1,the lousiest song ever,this is third cheesy song from her latest disasterous cd which bombed very badly.i could not stop laughing on watching her immature infantile antics of trying to commit suicide.this horrible single is like commting musical genocide.dont touch this stupid cd with a million foot pole.avoid at all costs.
4,VERY TOUCHING...,"I can't say that I'm a huge Britney fan, but this single makes me want to be one! EVERYTIME is surprisingly touching, effective, meaningful and artistically expressive (a first for Britney - in my opinion). My absolute fave tracks on this single, however, are the remixes! They make buying this import totally worth while! They're funky, edgy, fast-paced and so much fun! Love her or hate her, this single by Miss Spears is excellent, one of her best, and worth the extra cash!"
5,"Britney's ""Everytime"" sparkles","The song ""Everytime"" is Britney's most beautiful ballad. Though it states another writer, from interviews you'll see that Miss Spears composed this tune all herself, from the haunting lyrics to the simple and complex melody; sure, the other woman may have helped on instruments used other than the piano for the CD track, but know this: BRITNEY IS THE SOLE COMPOSER OF THE SONG. It is her most personal song and one of her first that she sounds attached to on an emotional level (being that is about her ex Justin Timberlake). Not only does this song sound good but she does too, and her unique throatinesss is perfectly set to the background as she glides fragiley through it. The remixes are worthy, but the original -almost ethereal in effect- stands far superior to anything any other DJs or writers can add."
5,Simply Beautiful,Britney has outdone herself with this one. This ballad is just so amazing. I listen to it as I drive down by the beach and I can't get enough of it. I think it's one of Britney's best. Buy it! YOu wont regret it.
1,"Not All The Time, Everytime","It just surprises me when artists go soft, and they always don't seem to make it happen. That has happened with Jennifer Lopez and other manufactured artists, especially Britney Spears. Her latest single, Everytime, the third track from In The Zone, really isn't as good as her other signatures. I wasn't impressed at all at this song, it just sounded like a song Jessica Simpson conjured. With her image upon her previous songs: Me Against The Music with Madonna, and Toxic, it may also turn some fans away from her wild child reputation. It isn't a great song, and not really a joyous song either."
3,good song,I don't even like britney spears but I have to give it to her for putting out such an amazing piano ballad. The piano hook is catchy and the melody is beautiful. Her voice isn't so bad on this track like her other songs.
3,Great song,"That is, compared to all her other songs. I thought I liked all her other songs too when I first heard them. Then, I realized how stupid and ugly they all are. This one, however, is quite beautiful compared to her others, but still not great."
5,AWESOME - A MUST-READ,"I first read this book in the late 60's when I was a teenager. What a magnificant plot with great, vivid characters. I have re-read it about every 5 years since then. I lost the book, but hark, they have it in print on AMAZON! A must-read for any person, whether you are 13 or 80."
4,A Classic adventure tale,"I read this book aloud with my 13 year old son when were were on a long trip together. Moonfleet is highly recommened as a read-aloud. Great plot, great story of loss and redemption. There is a good reason this book is still in print over a hundred years after it was published."
4,A review for Moonfleet by Shantal Deepak,"Moonfleet is the story of 15 year old John Trenchard, who's an orphan who lives with his Aunt.One night, curiosity gets the better of him, and he gets trapped in the vault of the Old Mohune family of Moonfleet, and he witnesses the trade of the sneaky, sly smugglers.After this experience, his life is never the same again, and he finds himself leading a completely new life altogether.I enjoyed reading Moonfleet, as I haven't read this style of text before. Once you start reading, the words engulf you, and you get caught up in the adventurous storyline.I'm glad that Moonfleet hasn't got too much description, but just the right amount, so that you can understand the story.Because of this we can at parts, feel the characters emotions.I would recommend Moonfleet to anyone, whether you like tragedy or humour, this is definitely a worthwhile read!"
4,Moonfleet book review,"This gripping tale of terror, betrayal and friendship that will haunt you at night This fantasy story is about 15 year old Jhon Trenchard, an orpan who accidently finds the secret entrence into the Pirate world: The Vault. Here, he discovers the truth about his friends Ratsy and Elzevir: They are Pirates! Johngoes on terrifying adventures and journey and just about escapes death AND... to find out the rest you'll have to read the book. Although the book has the use of archaic words I got use to it as I got deeper into the book. The terrific storylines keeps you reading hours on end, from cover to cover. Although at the start it was a little boring, the storyline improved within pages from the start."
4,"A Review On Moonfleet, Written By Bethany Allen","Do you like reading? Well, Moonfleet is the novel for you. Moonfleet is a gripping adventure story about the Mohune family who are a secret group of pirates. John Trenchard, a 15-year-old hero, tells the story. It is full of lots of exciting things from love to fear, nightmares and horror. The village of Moonfleet lies half a mile from the sea where secrets are told and many things are revealed.I would recommend this book mainly to boys but I can promise you that I couldn't put it down and I am an 11-year-old girl. It is definitely a book for all ages and if you like thrilling adventure stories then Moonfleet is the one for you!"
2,moonfleet by Katy Stevens,"Moonfleet is a well written book once you get past the long- winded introduction. I'm sure this book would have been very popular during the 19th centuary, but as i am only 12 i found it very hard to understand some of the words, and personnally i do not enjoy reading a book with a dictionary near by at all times. When the book begins John trenchard (the main character)is 15 and lives with his aunt in the village of moonfleet, a village with many tales of smugglers and pirates, including the worst of them all - the legendary blackbeard. the story is about john and his adventures, all related to the treasure belonging to blackbeard. If you enjoy long hard words with a book that tells an ok tale then this book is for you but i really wouldn't recomend it to children."
1,Rather do athletics than read Moonfleet & I HATE athletics!,"This book was made for an acquired taste...1 which I don't have! Although it is named a children's book, I think it is just as, if not MORE, suitable, for older people-adults, for example!The main character is John Trenchard, a young lad who lives on the island of Moonfleet, a place filled with smugglers, pirates, mystery and ADVENTURE!! Join John as he searches for Blackbeard's (legendary pirate's) treasure and tries to help his secret crush, Grace Maskew.The characters are interesting- wise old Mr.Glennie to name one. Another is Mr.Maskew, the book baddie. (After all, every book needs one!!) He is also Grace's cruel father.John has so much on offer for him in Moonfleet...the chance to explore a new world of the good, the bad...and the ugly!For those who like classic, 19th century adventure-stories, J. Meade Faulkner has made the perfect book for you! Enjoy! (Hopefully a LITTLE more than I did!)BY NIKITA BASSI."
1,A Reveiw Of Moonfleet by Bianca Popovic,"This book is a tale of Pirates, smugglers, their treasure and a young boy called John Trenchard who is the book hero. It is set in Moonfleet (Just off the south coast of England)in 1757. In the book John is an orphan living with his aunt. Also there has been a mysterious death that is almost unexplainable.I found this book quite boring but one of my book buddys found it very interesting. I would recommend it to a boy not a girl it's a boy's fantacy adventure book."
3,A Review of Moonfleet by Lucy Crabtree,"Moonfleet is a good book once you get into it, but it takes quite a long time to do that. The first 3 or 4 chapters are a little boring but once the story unfolds things start to get interesting. The book is set in the 1700s and is about an orphaned boy called John Trenchard who lives in the village of Moonfleet, which is full of smugglers, with his aunt. One day he finds a locket that once belonged to the legendary pirate Blackbeard, and his life becomes very different. If you want to find out what happens after that, you will have to read the book!It has got some quite hard words in it, but I think that this book is quite suitable for children aged 10 and over and adults might enjoy it, too."
3,kiss - killers,"only for kiss fans. except the 4 new songs as a novelty, which are not in any KISS album, no surprises. Okay, the other tracks are good, to have an overview of their music, but the sound is poor. Not remastered. I repeat: only for fans who will be excited to get 4 bonus unreleased tracks."
2,Not a full sound,"I really enjoy Kiss, but I just don't think any of the early studio recordings can beat the richness of Alive and Alive II. It just seams like something is missing here. The four extra soungs are probably just some extra tunes Paul had written that could not make it onto another album, like Unmasked, at the time."
4,General Army,This is a album that was not released in the US but as some good songs & some new ones. But I'm bias I have aKISS fan as long as I can remember.
4,Would Be Better Remastered,"This is possibly the best compilation album released by KISS. Excluding the four new songs, the songs are some of the best. It's a shame that Strutter wasn't on there. Also, there were no songs from Hotter Than Hell on the CD. There's another version that has two other tracks on it. The other tracks are only available on the band's official website. The live version of Rock & Roll All Night could've been better, especially since the lyrics were screwed up in the sleeve."
3,Decent CD containing some worthy unreleased tracks.,"KISS fans probably have most of these songs on other KISS compilation CDs', however, KISS Killers contains tracks not released in the USA that are worthy of attention. ""I'm a legend tonight"",""Down on your knees"" and the stellar ""Nowhere to run"" will have you wondering why these songs have not been released in the US."
3,A must for the Die-Hard KISS fan,"The four songs on this CD that were never released in America is the number 1 reason to own this CD. I bought 2, one of em you JUST DONT OPEN!!!"
3,Moondog,"My husband and I used to see ""The Viking"" when we worked in Manhattan. We had no idea who he was and after a Google search found his bio and were amazed, so we just had to buy this album. Talented, sure, but his music is most unusual."
4,"1 is good, 2 is awful","The tracks from Moondog 1 I thought were excellent and well worth buying the disc. However Moondog 2 was all the same: drum machine and lots ""pom"" ""pom"" ""pom"" vocals. I couldn't listen to it for long."
5,Excellent material,This book helps to thouroughly explain Faith Promise Giving. It is practical and applicable using God's Word to enforce it's teaching.
4,Very good astronomy series,"I own the VHS tapes of this series and enjoyed it very much. It has beautiful visual effects and shows much about the personal lives of the astronomers. It would have been even better if Carl Sagan, the most lively and interesting astronomer of our time, had been involved in the making of this series. Unfortunately, he does not even appear in any of the episodes. A decade had passed since the Cosmos series, and Sagan, perhaps because of health reasons, was apparently unable to contribute his talents to this project. But it is a very compelling series since you can see the work astronomers do from a very personal perspective. The graphics and animation are attractive and appealing with the use of the best technology that was available at that time."
1,Winston's Potty Chair Video,Item was in good condition. Seller was very prompt in getting the item to me.
1,not worth buying it,I expected to see in this video how specifically we manage to use pottys at gas station or in an airplane. None of those details this video was successful of showing us. Audio was awful and unclear. Too much stereotype about advice to parents.
2,boring 2 pack set,"viewed it 1st was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching,waiting,hoping!!!,the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough, must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the picture.My advise is for you to save your money and buy comos (the best imo)To be honest, i couldn't wait to sell it used at a $10 lose through amzn.the following week(they get a commission for sold items)nonetheless,i am content i no longer own it.Next time i will rent before purchasing on amzn. Just So you know, ""cosmos"" i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from amzn..the late carl sagans""cosmos"" blows away ""the astronomer"""
2,Too fast! Non-stop reading of scripts!,"The content is full of valuable information on selling. But this Audio CD is not my favourite.Ziglar speaks so rapidly and non-stop! I guess nobody speaks in this mannner. I mean, if you want listeners to enjoy your speech, it is better to speak in a more natural pace, occassionally there should be a pause.Ziglar is rushing the scripts when you listen to this CD. Choking the brain of the listeners with no respite whatsoever! Slow down Slow down......... Ziglar! Give me some space to absorb your message!I wish I can listen to your CD comfortably, but I can't. You Read the scripts in such a rapid manner that it does not help your listeners to relax and enjoy your works. Ziglar!I am sorry, I have to give you 2 stars based on your unsatisfactory presentation in this CD."
1,zig zglar not helpful this time,"MR.ZIGLAR HAS LOST SITE ON THIS CD, I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND HIM TO BE FANTASTIC, NOT SO MUCH ON THIS ONE. I WAS DISAPPOINTED."
4,Off to a good Start.,""" Timber Frame Construction "" provides a good basis of knowledge for the expeirenced builder intrested in learning post and beam joinery , from the history of the craft to tools and joints. I found the book a valuable source for my project.On the down side I could have used more explanation on what joints to use, the best cutting sequence and a greater description of where not to use them.Overall though I recommend it."
5,Secrets of a Singing Female Voice: Low & High Voice,"Great book. Really helps easily clarify issues about singing that seem obvious only after you learn them. It comes with a CD that provides you with singing exercises. The format of the book is easy to read and doesn't weigh you down with lengthy explanations or jargon. I can't afford singing lessons and this book/cd feels like having my own voice coach. I would especially recommend this book to someone like me who has been singing their entire life, but doesn't feel like they have it ""quite right."""
1,Would make you want to stop singing !,"Frankly disappointing. I wish I had return it straight away.The voice on the audio is just horrible ! Makes you want to turn the cd player off, off with your great ambition to improve your singing technique !Save your money and go by a nice record of your favorite female singer to sing along with her."
5,A tribute to dumb but nice .. I mean REAL .. nice,"If you like books about dumb nymphomaniacal bimbos then this realy is the one for you .. I'd say that Ray Gordon should get a Pulizer .. if they had the above category ....The story deals with Candy .. a young married in the burbs in the UK with nothing to do but get into mischief during the day while her husband's at work ... So one day some bondage porn pics show up at hewr doorset and .. lo and behold .. it's Candy herself ... She can't believe it ...It doesn't take long for her husband's work mate to show up and blackmail her for the yummies if you know what I mean...I have read books like this before, trust me this isn't one of Ray Gordon's original plotlines .. LOLOLOL .. but this guy is such a great writer that even the dumbest of stories and even the dumbest of bimbos makes it fun reading ....And if you like these kind of women .. I sure have never found one yet .. the RUN and buy this book.."
1,"John Locke, Original Hipster: the enlightenment roots of counterculture","This title is a REVIEW of the book title shown. Once I paid to download it and read it, I realized that I just spent $6.00 to read someone's opinion on a book. What's worse is this book review wanders all over the place never really giving a clear picture of what the book actually is like. The reviewer is more caught up in trying to be witty/clever than in giving insight into the book. I barely had the patience to finish this review - - but this could be because I was preoccupied with feeling ripped off! For those wishing to buy downloads, beware - read every word in the title & watch for the words (Book Review) embedded in a lengthy title."
4,Just a small modification,"Great squirrel feeder. I bought this one to replace another which had finally disintegrated after many years of use. It appears to be well built and should last a long time. One problem however, is that the openings on either side are a bit too large; the local racoons discovered they could lean in and reach all the corn and nuts. Learning quickly, they raided and emptied the entire contents every night. I attached a small square piece of treated wood to block about half the holes on either side which eliminated the nightly raids but still allow the squirrels to get in and out."
5,Great fun!,A friend gave us this feeder and it has been a riot to watch the squirrels with it!We have it bolted to the deck and it has provided a lot of entertainment watching the antics of the little guys getting into and out of it. My only regret is that I didn't find it many yrs ago!
5,Great Squirrel Feeder!,"The squirrels were doing backflips trying to get into the bird feeders so I decided to get them their own. This holds a lot of food and the glass jar lets you watch them rummaging through the food picking out their favorite nuts. I love seeing them sprawl out on the top of the glass jar, relaxing after stuffing their tummies. Only drawback is sometimes the birds find their way into the jar and it takes awhile for them to get back out."
2,Squirrel Jar Feeder,"I watched as the squirrel ventured cautiously into the jar. The tree to which the jar is affixed is next to the road, and right at that time a man on a golf cart drove by. The frightened squirrel frantically tried to exit the jar, but was facing the way it had entered, away from the opening. I watched it scramble around inside the jar, trying to ""escape"", and thought I might even have to go out and rescue it! The traumatized squirrel finally turned itself around and was able to get out, however, I have never seen a squirrel go completely into the jar since that time. They venture no further than the opening."
2,Very Basic,"There was very little information in this video that went much beyond a basic european facial.Presenter performed two facials - one with an AHA exfoliation and one with an enzyme exfoliation and an alginate modeling masque. This was not worth it to me, but probably would be good for an esthetic student."
3,"Earphone is good, Plug is weak","I can confirm what others have written, that the headset itself works fine, but the plug that plugs into the dialing unit is very weak, and the wire eventually breaks. I tried taking the wire apart to see if I could re-connect the broken wires, but the wires are so tiny that they are impossible to work with."
2,Headsets have not met my expectations,I have had 2 Plantronics Ct 12's. Love the phone. Headsets have been a real problem. No matter how careful I am with the headsets they seem to last only a few months. I have replaced headsets several times. I hope Plantronics is working on a better design.
3,Headset plug inferior,"I have two plantronics ct12's. Love them. HATE the headset plug.. Goes out (starts a cracking static noise) in a year or so. I like the units so if anyone know who repairs the plugs I have 4 or 5 headsets in the ""dont work"" drawer. Best price to replace is amazon at $43 and change."
2,Headset Review,Love the headset but I must be hard on them. I've had to buy a new headset 3 or 4 times because the wire that goes into the plug breaks and the headset needs to be replaced. Love the product but if someone comes out with a headset that's a little more robust I'm going that way. Don't buy this if you move around a lot because the wire will break and the headset will need to be replaced.
5,Howard McGhee-forgotten trumpet master,"This compilation of blue note sides w. gigi gryce and tal farlow is very possibly the best music on record that Howard McGhee has left us. Absolutely gorgeous full tone working mostly mid-register, McGhee's trumpet lines are always clear, clean and creative. No grandstanding. No cliches. The band sounds thouroughly rehearsed and very modern in each musician's approach to their insturment's sound. Though early miles, diz, clifford brown and fats navarro get the bop notice,these sides are masterpieces by a truly overlooked trumpet master. The recording quality and transfer to cd is very vivid and clean. ESSENTIAL. TRANSCENDENT."
2,"Tough reading, but good scholarship","What makes this book such tough sledding for the amateur historian? Is it because the book was translated from German to English? Whatever the cause, reading the book is as captivating as reading a similar account from an encyclopedia. It is more like reading a technical report than a book. Now the good news; the book is logically constructed, flows well, and has a dauntingly thorough bibliography. If you muster the self discipline to stay with the author, you will be rewarded with a deep knowledge of the Goths. It is a book by a historian for other academics. Frankly, there are more readable books on the subject available from other authors."
3,Didn't hold up to puppy chewing and not much filling,"I have one of these that is a few years old, and after going through 3 dogs, it needed replacement. The new one I just ordered was destroyed after just a couple of play sessions and the filling was about 3/4 as much as the previous toy. If you have a puppy or dog with strong chewing, you probably shouldn't consider this toy (I have an 8 month old goldendoodle)."
1,Poor quality,"Poor quality, very disappointing. it fell apart when I pulled it out of the box. Go with ChuckIt indoor ball instead."
3,A good read,"I thought this was a very enjoyable book. It was a nice combination of short stories, poetry, songs, memoirs, and legends. It was both informative and entertaining at the same time. I would recomend this book to anyone who likes to read Native literature."
4,Black Mountain 6 Person Cabin Tent,"I thought the tent to be fairly nice. I found the material light and breathable. I did have lots of helpers in setting it up. Maybe one could have done it, but not very easily.There were a few items I found to be a problem. The two velcro locations for the light being one. With the rain cover on, the outside location is covered and is useless. And, if you store anything in the center inside cargo net it blocks the light again.The directions were not good, but put it up a time or two and you will not need the directions anyway.It was hard to tell the short pole of the three caped ones. The front door mat loop connection ripped off the tent when trying to replace the accidently used short pole from the top of the tent with the slightly longer one.The expandable container bag was very nice.It did rain for about an hour during the church campout. The tent did very well. I did notice high inside humidity that night and the next morning, but we didn't get wet."
1,Not as Advertised,"This is not a wallet with a place to put money, as the picture shows shows. Also, the card slots are oriented vertically, instead of horizontally."
5,not just a good day,it's a great day for da hood. i loved all three of em but unfortunately only own friday.
3,"It's perdy good, but I've seen better","Hey man, It's starts out comical and stays that way throughout most the movie, but then near the end it gets serious on you really fast, kinda unexpected, but still it's worth a movie to rent once, it mostly depends on what your looking into a movie for, for me it was slapping your knee, rolling in the floor comedy, which Chris Tucker done most of that for me, but it does get a lil serious towards the end, overall, I say it's worth watching but not worth buying, but as always, thats my opinion. Peace out."
5,Friday (New Line Platinum Series),"Having just been canned from his job on his day off, Craig and his best friend Smokey spend the day smoking up in their South Central neighborhood while dealing with a neighborhood bully, relationship troubles, an angry drug dealer, and a lot of other odd characters. This movie has a hilarious supporting cast, including John Witherspoon, Tiny Lister, and Bernie Mac. If you ever have a chance to see this movie, and enjoy urban comedy and Chris Tucker, don't even hesitate to watch."
5,Funniest dope movie since Up In Smoke,"Gotta love the entire cast, even bully Deebo. The flatulent, taco/burrito eating, dog catching father is a hoot and Smokey is a real anchor in the film. I love the way the sister rips on Craig, and Mom is like June Cleaver-oblivious to what's going on.The sequels were so-so, but the original ROCKS! I can't stand cursing on network TV, but I hate when Friday comes on regular TV, because without the cussing, the movie has far less comedic impact."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,I saw this movie when i was 5 with my parents. This is by far one of the funniest movies ever. Smokey was a great addition to this movie to bad this was the only one he was in. now i am 12 and i still love it ice cube is a geneious his best acting work was the friday series and then boys in the hood. Im not the guy to support smokin weed but this movie still rules. well one last thing i may be a metalhead but the music vids in this are awesome espesialy DR.DRE. thank god its friday
1,TERRIBLE COPY,"Unlike most people here, I can tell you that Amazon IS NOT IMDB so STOP reviewing the MOVIES POEPLE!! This copy has all the scenes that were deleted from the original so it makes the movie not as funny. Blu ray?? yeah right!! More like VHS/DVD quality. Another way the movie industry is ripping off people by stamping a movie Blu ray and jacking up the price. So in a nut shell the image quality is poor and it has scenes that are not funny and were deleted for a reason. If you want to know if this movie is funny go to IMDB. This is how people should review a movie on Amazon!!!!"
2,Friday,Not as funny as I thought it was seventeen years ago. I also see why Chris Tucker opted out of future sequels.
5,Awsome,i think this is the most awsome movie ever made. it is so funny. chris tucker is an awsome actor. the movie wouldn't be the same with out him. he's awsome and he's too fine.
5,the best,"this is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time,,no doubt 5 stars. I liked the part when (Tiny Lister) gets knocked the #$%& out,he deserved it too..good stuff,,must see."
5,ICE CUBE CAN MAKE MOVIES,FRIDAY IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER ! IT MAKES ME LAUGH SO HARD IT MAKES ME CRY .. ICE CUBE AND CHRIS TUCKER ARE GREAT TOGHETER. AND MAY I ADD THE HISPANIC GUY THAT PLAYS HECTOR ACTOR DEMETRIUS NAVVARO IN THE MOVIE IS THE FINEST VATO IN THE WORLD !! YOU MUST HAVE THIS MOVIE .. ITS THE BEST !!!! FROM THE ONE AND ONLY TRIXXXY
3,save ur money...,"Needless to say this movie is a classic!!! I saw the movie was released on Bluray and bought it spontaneously. The transfer isn't as good as I hoped and I barely consider it an upgrade from the DVD. If you already own the DVD, then I'd recommend just saving your money."
3,Originl better than Directors Cut,The original Friday is a classic. The extra footage and material still bring new laughs to this viewer. Wish they would have added a copy of the original theatre release as well.
3,Enjoyable and well made but no biggie,"I've seen this film two times and I just don't get it. All the fury about it. It's funny, it's well made, but I don't get the humor; I understand it and all that. The cool part about the movie is it shows life in the hood compressed into a 24 hour period, which is a nice narrative device. I liked the movie, thought it was nicely done, but just couldn't laugh at it, though I really wanted to.I'd still recommend it because of all the praise it's gotten. Just as an example of funny films - take a look at The In-Laws (made in 1979, not the remake). That film is funny, however unreal the activities are."
3,"Good comedy, but gets old","Friday is overall a funny comedy, in fact it's hilarious thefirst time you see it, but the more you watch it, the less funny itgets, so I wouldn't recommend buying it. The only other problem with the movie is that Cube and Tucker just sit on the porch all day. I thought they'd at least go out and try some funny stuff to get the money for Big Per - I mean Big Worm. END"
3,Eh its ok,This movie is overrated but hey this is Amazon. Anyway the story takes place in one day. Ice Cube and his best friend Chris Tucker have to raise money to get Chris Tucker out of a jam. I really dont think Chris Tucker is amusing at all...just annoying. The movie has a few laughs though it mostly falls flat. Ice Cube's dad is an idiot and sooooooo not funny. I give it 3 stars only because the plot centers on weed.
1,Find something else to do on Friday,This is a pitiable movie. Craig (Ice Cube) loses his job and then decides to hang out with his stoner friend Smokey (Chris Tucker); and they both start smoking marijuana. Later they are confronted by drug dealers looking for their money. I am glad that Craig hooked up with Debbie (Nia Long) at the end. Chris Tucker is really annoying in this. I am really surprised that this movie had two sequels. This is considered one of Michael Jordan's favorite movies.
1,One of the worst of all time,"I had to write something when I saw how high this movie was rated here. I rate very few movies this low, but in this case I really can't see how else it can be scored. The film was totally pointless and had a very dreary feel to it. I watched it with someone that laughed quite a bit, and I honestly don't understand that reaction."
1,Not funny and very boring,I invited three of my friends over to watch this and all three of them left half-way through the movie it was so bad. The dialouge is awful and the story is boring. Just because people sit around doing nothing in real life doesn't mean it's interesting to watch.Only hardcore Ice Cube fans will like this movie. If you want to see a good Ice Cube movie watch Anaconda.
1,Hilarious movie. Butchered Blu-Ray.,WARNING!!!This is without a doubt the best comedy I have ever seen. Simply brilliant. The dvd is worth 5+ stars easy.HOWEVER!!!This Blu-Ray transfer has an INSANE AMOUNT OF CONTRAST making all the colors scream. It looks so bad I thought I'd cry when I first saw it.BUY THE DVD NOT THE BLURAY.
5,hilarious and exciting,"this video cracked me up,i can see why some people dont like it cause it's got a lot of the ""d"" word but i loved it,my friends and i watch it all the time,plus,the acting was excellent.i reccomend this movie.see it!"
1,Never received the actual movie!,This item I never recoded the actual item I received the case but inside the case was the movie the omen so I returned the item back I never received a refund or the original item so iam not happy with this at all please respond in an email.
3,pretty good,Chris Tucker alone is the picture.it's his best performance of all. his other films are 2nd&3rd tier Eddie Murphy knock offs.Ice Cube is okay same with Nia Long.it has some funny scenes but far from a classic.but seeing Chris Tucker doing the Michael Jackson is stupid funny.if the film had matched his skill than it would have been a 5.John witherspoon is funny as well.
4,Sleeper Hit,"This is one of those movies where the trailer along with the mixed reviews makes it difficult to decide whether or not to see it. Basically the best way to decide is by actually seeing it. I thought it was a really good movie. The story follows the events that happen to two young guys on a particular Friday. It has quite a few laughs along with a pretty decent (overall...aside from all the weed smoking) message to young ones. Some of the leading ladies were well cast. Nia Long as Debbie, Paula Parker as Joi, and Angela Means as Felisha. If you want to see these women in other films check out Boyz in the Hood and House Party."
5,Laugh out loud great,"I love this movie and it's sequel (I've not yet seen the third in the series). It's hillarious. Ice Cube is great and Chris Tucker is his usually funny self. The combination is good and it's fun watching them pass the day while trying to stay out of trouble. Chris going to the toilet al fresco is entertaining, and there is a good cameo by Bernie Mac. As a lighthearted fun movie, this is good. Watch a copy of this and you'll want to purchase your own."
4,2nd best in the series.,"Friday after Next is the best to me, but this is a funny classic about 2 friends, Smokey(Chris Tucker), and Craig(Ice Cube), who dont have anything to do, so they sit around, and Smokey pushes Craig to get high, the only problem is its not Smokeys weed, He has to pay this guy within 24 hours, or else the guy will ""smoke"", Smokey and Craig. Funny film, worth the money."
4,One and Only!,"I had ifs about this movie cause all I heard is how it takes place infront of one guys porch witnessing all these things happening right infront of him. So now done watching it this is a good comedy movie with a good story. Chris Tucker is in it and Ice Cube is the main guy where it all comes to him on Friday. So why did I like this movie? Mainly because movies like Cube, rely on one location and the characters to create a good imaginative vibe through their acting. This is funny!"
4,Great B movie.,"Friday is a great movie and belive it or not it is a cheap B movie.It is funny with Ice Cube who plays more of a serious part while Chris Tucker plays his stoned friend.This movie is about a teenager (Ice Cube) named Craig who loses his job for stealing something from the buisness on Thursday and gets into a whole lot of trouble on Friday like helping the neighborhood crook try to steal from their rich neighbor,get high for the first time and finally fight like a man.There is also another big problem in this movie, Smokey (Chris Tucker) must pay back a drug dealing ice cream man called Big Worm for drug's that Smokey said he would sell but instead ended up smoking it.Well, I can't tell you what happens at the end but Big Worm is a part of a drive-by.Just see this movie."
4,Friday Movies,"The movies are ok, Next Friday & Friday After Next (the 2nd & 3rd one) are better than the first one. A little corny and poorly written, but good for when you don't need to pay attention to whats going on. The graphics at the beginning of the movies are better than the movies themselves."
3,"1 is good, 3 is good...2 sucks.","In fact, 3 may be the best. 2...is horrible. For $16.00 though (my price) WTH."
5,ITS DA BEST COMEDY EVER MADE IT'S HILARIOUS AND SO IS SMOKEY,I think this movie should be seen by every person alive that likes to laugh cuz Ice Cube and Chris Tucker together in a movie make one funny movie.
1,Worse than Bad,"This movie is silly at best, racist at worse. I can't believe Ice Cube actually wrote the script for this mess. My opinion of Ice Cube has been drastically lowered. It's the old black jiving and shucking all over again. This movie has all the classic black stereotypes. It even has a scene where Smokey gets so high that he ends up in the chicken coop thinking he's a chicken. Remember the old minstrel shows?: ""nobody in here but us chickens."" There's no plot to speak of, just a bunch of insults, getting high, stealing money, potty jokes, black people knocking each other upside the head. Some character get punched out, and Smokey (Chris Tucker) goes over and yells in his face, ""Dude, you been knocked out!"" That's a typical ""joke"" from this movie. How about a dogcatcher getting bit on his behind by a dog? Hilarious---Not. After watching this dvd with my family, we tried to think of one funny or worthwhile scene, and we couldn't think of a single one."
1,"Come on, spare me the stupidity!","I only gave this movie one star because I had to. I really did feel that this is stupid and idiodic. All the plot is made of is a couple of pathetic potheads that live in some ghetto that have no money (as well as no life). I wouldn't recommend it. COME ON PEOPLE, GET WITH IT!"
1,THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE BD NOT THE MOVIE!,"Avoid this release. It ONLY includes the 'directors cut' which is hampered down with extended scenes that only drag...the...movie...on. Instead of the quick laugh, get in get out flow the original cut has, this one just keeps it going. I couldn't even finish it it was so awful to watch. AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE. LOVE IT. One of my favorite comedies by a stretch, just not this release.The video transfer isn't so hot, either. Really, unless you're just super curious about what was cut out so long ago (which adds zero to anything) stick with your DVD copy. Even at the $10 price point, it's not worth it. Not to mention THIS IS BLU RAY - there's MORE than enough room to include this cut and the original cut, and probably some 3rd cut that is just Mr. Parker chasing his wife out of the house.This movie deserves SO much better."
4,If you haven't seen it you haven't lived,"Hey everyone~ to those of you that haven't seen Friday---buy it!! rent it!! steal it!! just watch it cause it's funny as hell and you'll be talking about it for months afterwards. I'm off like a prom dress, Peace."
3,Selling out?,"Since AIM Media bought Backpacker from Rodale Press and brought on a former Outside magazine editor, some of the down-to-earth relevance of this once dependable, informative, readable magazine has gone out the window in favor of more titillating fare. It hasn't reached the bottom of the barrel like Outside (with its emphasis on macho self-indulgence), but recent articles like the one describing how the father abuses his daughter on camping trips (Feb 08) make one wonder where it's headed."
3,Changed a lot over the years,"I stopped my subscription because the magazine has changed a lot through the years. Not enough hikes, backpacking information. Too many adds, bizarre contests, not enough content."
2,"If I wanted ads and political commentary, I'd subscribe to Time","Every now and again, I'll get suckered back into subscribing for this mag. I'm an avid outdoorsman who has climbed about 15 of NY's highest peaks. Although I don't do much backpacking anymore due to a ruptured disk and age, I still enjoy reading about places to go and the latest gear. Well, this magazine used to do that for me. Now it is a watered down version of the old rag.What irked me the most though is being fed one sided environmental claptrap and political commentary. The people behind this magazine and mags like Outside don't believe there are conservatives who love and care for the outdoors. I don't care for the high browed attitudes espoused by many on the outdoor community. If I wanted that kind of commentary, I'll read ""insert liberal magazine here"". I want to read about backpacking, not your agenda thanks."
4,A good magazine,"A nice magazine, mostly intended for USA citizens. If you are from other countries or you dont live in USA you might look elsewhere. It has a lot of info and trails for USA. It also has good advice on gear and tricks to make your life easier and safer on the field, so if you get a good discount for a subscription go for it, despite the fact you dont live on USA. If I was living at USA I would give it a 5 star rating"
1,"Don't read this, just go outside instead","This magazine clearly exists mostly to convince you to buy gear. If you're into backpacking, it's easy to get hung up on gear choices, and that can interfere with your enjoyment of the activity. Stop worrying about it, and don't listen to Backpacker Magazine, and just go outside instead. You don't need all that junk. They do have a lot of recommendations for destinations, but with this newfangled invention called The Internet you can find all kinds of information about destinations. They also have lots of ""tips"" for backpacking and camping; few are useful, some are obvious, and a handful are just dumb, bad ideas. Don't bother with Backpacker."
3,Great to okay,"Like everyone else, I think this mag used to be far better. It is now too glossy and sales oriented, but hey that's where the money is, right? I do like the personalized touch of regional maps (most of which are pretty useful). It is a good mag to get you to trails if you are new to hiking. I always appreciated that Backpacker isn't as over-the-top, Xtreme like many outdoor mags. I have no desire to climb Everest or jump out of a plane with a snowboard. I hope the editors will get back to basics, but, as for now, it is a good pick for people who want to get into it or for people who just like to drool over cool gear and imagine that they are into it."
3,They lost me,"I used to pick this up regularly until one issue featuring an article listing the most scenic places to defecate was written. I figured by that time, the editorial staff had just about scraped the bottom of the pit toilet not having anything better to write about. Still, there are some good trail write-ups from time to time. They'll have to work harder to get me back though."
1,Order not Shipped & I could not cancel it. EVER they told me.,"I ordered 2 Backpackers by accident. Only needed 1 as a BD present. Order says it wont ship for several weeks. I tried to cancel the entire order. I was told by Amazon Customer Service that the magazine was being shipped from a warehouse and not only could it not be cancelled today, but never in the future as well. WHAT? What kind of business model is this? Good Bye Amazon. I won't ever be ordering from you. You hi-jacked my business. I won't ever foregt that. --------Shocked and very dissatisfied. 9-2-2010"
5,Fabulous!,"This magazine has me reading cover to cover everytime it arrives! It's amazing how interesting the survival tactics are, and the stories of near death experiences- all things any adventurer can learn from!"
5,My son LOVES this magazine!,My son says this is the best magazine he's read in a while. I'm sure it takes him places in his mind that he's never dreamed of going before. It is inspiring to him and he has visions of hiking the Appalachian Trail in the future.
2,Still Waiting on Backpacker,Amazon sent me an E-Mail to write a review for my Magazine Subscription. The problem is I haven't received one issue yet. I didn't expect to be waiting months to receive my first issue.
4,Move into the Digital Erra!,"Download zinio on your Iphone and get the digital version. Then read about some of the great apps available (in the digital version on your Iphone) that turn your Iphone into a gps map, a compass, a camera with range finder, and more! Don't forget to buy a Brick (a big battery with USB ports) to keep your phone charged; solar powered bateries tend not to work too well when you are out in the woods hiking all day. One good thing however with the print magazine; if in an emergency, you need to start a fire...!!!"
1,Downhill,"Like other reviewers have said, the content has gone downhill from informative articles on gear and places to go, to garbage that has nothing to do with backpacking. They sell out to gear companies, endorse shady gear companies ie: Big Sky, and the writing style almost requires you to have a.d.d. to read it ( tons of very short blurbs and ""tips"" thrown all over ).To top it off, they have been sending me threatening letters to pay for issues they sent me after my subsription ended and I didn't renew it."
1,Devious renewal policy,"This publication has gone to an assumed automatic renewal - with no choice by the subscriber. Since I didn't agree to this arrangement I didn't bother to respond. The next thing I knew, I was receiving a collection notice."
1,Obnoxious and harrasing subscription renewal phone calls,"Over the past several weeks I have received up to three calls per day from Backpacker urging me to renew my subscription ""now!"". The frequency and tone of these calls have crossed the line into obnoxious harrassment. A number of the calls have occured minutes after I hung up on the previous call. I am letting my subscription end and am not renewing due to this rude and intrusive treatment from Backpacker. This is coming from someone who has been subscribing to the magazine for well over ten years!Note that there is no Masthead on the magazine to tell the reader the structure of the organization, nor is there any contact point via e-mail except on the website and that is to Customer Service. I am sure all inquiries to Customer Service are given prompt attention when they are critical of Customer Service.If this is Backpackers new method of securing subscription renewals, I am better off without it!"
1,Watch out for the annual renewal at $40 / year!,"SYNAPSE - is a company that collects $40 each year to renew this subscription for Back Packer Magazine. There is no annual notification and since I was not the receiver of the magazine, I was unaware of it being continued, until I found the charge on my credit card statement."
2,"not great, most ads and short articles","Like all magazines its full of adds. The articles very basic and lack depth, the best parts of the magazines is the pictures."
2,have nothing yet,As of May 17 I have yet to receive my first issue so I cannot recommend it. It is disapointing that it is taking so long to begin my subscription.
2,Love the Magazine...if it arrived,"I ordered three subscriptions from various sources via Amazon. Two arrived immediately, two months later still waiting on Backpacker. Seriously?"
1,WHERE IS IT???,"I know that I would really like the magazine IF I WOULD ever get it! Maybe I am used to immediate electronic info, but, over a month now...really?"
1,What magazine?????,Interesting... Amazon wants a review of this magazine and I haven't even received the first issue yet. My review? No comment.
3,Too many ads,I just got my first copy of this magazine and was disappointed to see that the first 11 pages were all advertising. The magazine was 98 pages and 38 pages were advertisements which is pretty close to 40%. I understand that it's not easy being a magazine in this internet age but I don't want to read a magazine that is half advertising. If you're going to do that then you should give away the magazine for free. (if I was living in the US and could get the $12 subscription deal then it wouldn't bother me so much but I think it costs about $40 to subscribe from Japan).
5,Great,"Love the magazine, it really has good information about gear and equipment. My fiancé and I love when we get it in the mail"
3,too much random information,"I got this magazine in order to see some great photos and read interesting stories that I couldn't get from the [...] site. I'm sadly not impressed. Each issue seems to be filled with lists: trails to try, new equipment to purchase, etc. There's lots and lots of content but it's in a format that might be better suited for the internet. In fact, it seems like they're taking the [...] website and stuffing it into a glossy printed format. I really like the website but I will not be renewing my subscription to the mag. I guess I was hoping that this magazine would be a companion piece to the site, instead of the same old stuff."
2,I guess I misunderstood.,"I signed up for two free issues of backpackers magazine. There was no mention of having to sign up for a years subscription. I did receive the two free issues but did not really care for the magazine. The magazine mostly shows hiking trails for various regions around the country. None of which are close to me and honestly I was really looking for a magazine that discussed gear, techniques, etc. rather than specific hiking trails. I guess I misunderstood the meaning of free because I have been getting constant demands for subscription payments."
4,great magazine,I really liked getting this magazine. the stories were informative and I liked how they set out people to actually walk the trails and give a detailed directions for the hike that they were on. only reason for not a 5 star rating is that there is to much advertising through out the whole magazine.
2,Disappointing content,"Backpacker Magazine has lots of articles that I don't read. Too much of the publication is devoted to describing fantastic hikes in exotic locations and not enough space is given to backpacking equipment and supply reviews. Then there's the ridiculous articles recently published on Bear Grylls - who any true backpacker can recognize as a media creation. With a hunting knife clamped between his teeth as he dives off a 100-foot cliff into a raging river filled with man-eating crocks .............. well, you get the picture and he certainly doesn't deserve mention in a magazine devoted to backpacking. But, there he is giving out all kinds of dubious survival advice that could do some real damage to the uninitiated."
2,Very disappointing,"I have no idea why this book is so highly rated, it was a terrible disappointment to me after reading about a dozen books in the genre. There are adventurers, and then there are adventurers who can write, and the fact that I had to go back several times to believe what was so casually mentioned in a paragraph--the death of two of the original three crew members--should have been a sign that I could have put the book down without missing out on anything. Unless you are getting way down on your reading list or find this at a garage sale, don't bother. There are too many great books such as Bernard Moitessier's The Long Way to get to first."
4,Gospel Jubilee,"I bought this album for two songs, Step into the water and God says you're gonna make it. Both are great. A couple of the other songs grow on you."
3,Disappointed,"After reading the other reviews about the tent, I was excited about the pricing and features the tent had. Unfortuantely, as some of the other reviewers inferred, the model sent was not the 05 model as advertised but a new cheaper made version without the storage locker, wheels on the cart, and clean sweep and with more mesh. The price was still a decent buy and I hope to get much use but overall I was disappointed and expected better."
5,Columbia Family Dome Tent,"We realy like this tent. It worked great on the cool coast and worm climates. Advise to setup at home for first time setup. The rainfly is tricky at first, but after first setup everything is a snap. This temt was made to last! Columbia did a great job, two doors makes it easy to get in and out form eather side."
3,Limited Compatibility,This system is only compatible with Nokia 5190 and 6190 cell phones. All other 5000 and 6000 series phones are not compatible. I would suggest contacting your wireless carrier and/or the manufacturer before purchasing this product to get any compatibility issues resolved.
2,More of the same.,"This guy can write, really write, so why do we have always the same old re-issues? Such a shame, such a lost opportunity - or is it just the record company milking the back catalogue. Whatever, ""Al, get off your backside and write soñething NEW"". And your - somewhat aging fans will go out and buy it, just as we have year after year after year etc:"
2,Sorry Louis,"I think Nicholas Payton is extraordinarily talented, well on his way to becoming one of the best jazz musicians of his generation. However, I think this CD relfects, perhaps, the incredibly fast pace of his stardom rather than a tribute to Louis. Some of the tunes (e.g., Helly Dolly)are almost unrecognizable. Personally, I think only the last tune (West End Blues) really makes you think of Louis. And who told Nicholas that he could sing? He's an outstanding trumpeter but a less than medicore vocalist. I'm not really disillusioned-- I will continue to buy his CD's and follow his career. I'm sure this is just a little bump in the road."
1,Nicholas Payton-Dear Louis,"I am sorry Nicholas, but as a true jazz affectionado, with over 1700 CD's in my collection, I can truly say you let us down on this one. What you did here in tribute to Louis is to create an unlistenable collection of instrumental fusion that bears no resenblance to our beloved Louis. If I could have given you a zero rating, I would have.I want you to know I loved you with Doc Cheatham on ""Doc Cheatham & Nicholas Payton"" You deserve a 5 star rating on that CD."
2,ISN'T THIS BOP?,"This doesn't sound like Traditional Jazz, sometimes called New Orleans Jazz, to me. It doesn't even sound like the broader classification of Dixieland Jazz to me. It sounds like bebop, or bop, to me.Louis Armstrong never degraded another musician as far as I know. Maybe Louie would have liked this, I don't know. I do know that I don't. There has never been another musician or singer with Louis' ability to send the audience home humming the melodies of the tunes in his show. If I had never heard Hello Dolly or I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You before I had heard this CD I would not be able to hum those tunes 10 minutes after hearing this CD. I'm sorry, but being born in New Orleans doesn't make you a New Orleans Jazz great.It is commendable that these modern music players have honored the great Louis Armstrong with this CD. The boppers should love it."
2,trying too hard,"Payton is too slick for me.I great musician with a great heartbut he over arranges and over produces.If you love Pops ,listen to Pops!"
5,"Grammy-nominated trumpeter, with mad skills","It should come as no suprise that Nicholas Payton's most recent CD, ""Dear Louis,"" has garnered him yet another well-deserved Grammy nomination. The title track, ""Dear Louis,"" plus ""Tight Like This"" and the Cuban classic, ""Peanut Vendor,"" are by far three of the best tracks on this amazing CD. Not only does Payton demonstrate a flair for composing his own works, but he also does a masterful job of arranging a number of Louis Armstrong favorites. If Louis Armstrong were alive today, I'm convinced he, too, would hold this CD is the highest regard. So, make ""Dear Louis"" an essential addition to your jazz CD collection--it's a winner."
5,fabulous resource,I found this book to be a fabulous resource with many fantastic ideas for teachers to incorporate into their writing programs. I was amazed when my students showed such enthusiasm toward their writing assignment. More amazing was thier eagerness to share what they had written. Every writing teacher should own this book.
1,A facade in lying for christ.,The video is representative of a sectarian religious viewpoint that has nothing to do with science and the producers purposefully misconstrue the information within. The interviews of the individuals were held under false pretenses.
1,"Come on suckers, at least don't pay to be lied to","You want to deny scientific reality? That's your business. Now, if you want to deny that bacteria are causing your bacterial meningitis or that falling pianos can cause serious trauma to the human body, you may not last very long. But if all you want to do is deny strong, important theories that explain, predict, and unify large bodies of data, like the theory of relativity or the theory of biological evolution, you may not pay an immediate physical price.Buy why on earth would you be dumb enough to shell out twenty bucks for a pack of lies that you can hear for free any time you want to? Or indeed, for anything that you can get for free? Save your money."
1,More Christian dishonesty,"This film was legend in the history of evolution science community before it was released, and was much discussed in the pubs during the Darwin celebration at Cambridge in 09. The film makers lied to the interviewees and never told them it was an anti-evolution documentary. I find it fascinating and telling that supposed moral Chrsitians find it so easy to lie."
1,Another Example of Creationists Lying For Jesus,"The creators of ""Evolution: The Grand Experiment Episode 1"" decided to follow in the footsteps of ""Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed,"" in that, ""Dr"" Carl Werner and his staff lied to several vertebrate paleontologists in order to interview them under false pretenses, and then deliberately edit the video footage of the so-called interviews to manufacture a false controversy, as well as to make it falsely seem like the paleontologists were either denying Evolutionary Biology, or unsure of it.In other words, this is just an anti-science, Creationism-cult propaganda video, chock full of heinous falsehoods and malicious distortions, and is completely, totally bereft of truth, and even Christian values. Quite frankly, I don't understand how this group of malevolent liars can sleep at night."
3,A good book for your library,"The Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants is a good book to have on your shelf if you are interested in if you want to know what wild plants are edible. The book does discuss many different types of plants that grow out in the wild. The Field Guide does a good job of discussing where to find the plants, how and when to harvest, and a general guide of preparing the food. Where I find this book lacking is that there are no actual pictures of the plants in question. Before I chose to eat something out in the wild I want to be doubley sure I am picking the right plant. So I do feel it is a good guide and filled with information, I wished some time could have been spent on photography for my personal piece of mind."
5,Saved my Life!,"When I was stranded with my dog in the Alaska Wilderness for a week and a half, this book saved my life. Without it, how could I have eaten well until the aircraft came - yes, you heard - eaten well! I thank Bradford Angier greatly for this wonderful text!"
1,Bad Copy Corrected -- make this 5 Stars,"Favorable reviews regarding this short film are themselves legendary and all appear to derive from the same source.""Mystic Fire Video"" had made an extremely bad copy of Mr. Anger's film and no DVD is available.But before Sheldon Rochlin died, I sent the retail purchased VHS copies of KA's films back to Mystic Fire; and after a considerable delay, Mr. Rochlin , himself a well known film maker, telephoned me, apologized and replaced said copies at no fee whatever. A class guy. I'm sorry he's dead.Fireworks is a short B&W; silent film circa 1947 regarding a young man out for an evening walk and adventure confronted by the brutality of a group of sailorsIts dream like visual expression makes Fireworks a classic."
5,Important and Historical Film,"One of the corner stones of Avant Garde films. One of Angers best and earliest. His best is Anger 3 which includes Lucifer Rising, Kar Klub Kommandos, and the Invocation of my Demon Brother. I believe a couple of rare copies are for sale in Z shops. Rare and hard to find but all his films are worth the search and the money"
5,"Fritz Lang classic, deserves better release","Fritz Lang classic, deserves better release, but this one is fine, great film, will do until they get their act together in releasing classics better, Fonda and Sidney are perfect"
3,Depression-era melodrama,"Released convict Eddie Taylor (Henry Fonda) tries to make an honest living for himself and his devoted wife, Joan (Sylvia Sidney), but the cards are stacked against them in this dark, fatalistic film from director Fritz Lang. This entertaining melodrama takes our characters on quite a rollercoaster ride, but cops out in its final seconds with a quite literal deus ex machina ending. I suspect that the ludicrous final moments of this film were tacked on by studio hacks who felt that the ending was too downbeat otherwise and probably didn't have the sanction of Lang. Fonda is convincingly angst-ridden in contrast to top-billed Sidney's comparatively simplistic cute, plucky performance./"
4,"""This war is not mine and I don't take note of it.""","Despite the goofs (power lines visible, rubber bayonet) the historical inaccuracies (using rifle not yet invented, I doubt you could refuse to join the Confederate army) and the unbelievable script I enjoyed this movie mainly because I've always liked Jimmy Stewart.Widower Stewart and his children operate a large farm in Virginia. The War looms all around but Stewart refuses to take part in it. When his youngest son is mistaken for a Reb and captured by the Yankees Stewart is forced to take action.A fun watch thanks to Stewart's powerful performance and the impressive supporting cast - Strother Martin, Denver Pyle, James Best and George Kennedy - but other than that I'd suggest watching WINCHESTER `73 instead if you want to see a good Stewart western."
5,Shenandoah 1965,"With thw integrity and depth of an epic SHENANDOAH tells the dramatic story of a man caught in a dilema . James Stewart (1908-1997) stars as a Virgian Farmer during the civil war . He Refuses to support the Confederacy because he is opposed to slavery , yet he will not support the Union because he is deeply to the war . When his son is taken prisoner , Stewart goes to search for the boy . Seeing first-hand the horrors of war , he is at last forced to take his stand . High Quality Transfer . Recommended"
4,Jimmy Stewart at his best,"Shenandoah is a moving film and showcased the late Jimmy Stewart in what I have always felt was his best performance. Jimmy was convincing as a valiant, rugged individual and should have played more of those sorts of roles. The score is outstanding and adds to the pathos at the various emotional crescendos. The one weak area of the film is the cliche ridden nature of segments of the dialog."
4,Good Casualty of War movie,I saw this movie many years ago in a theater and now at home and it still has all the grace and grab your guts feel to it now as before.What happens to the ones that cannot fight or do not want to fight and they watch as their loved ones do - powerful story.
5,One of his BEST films!,"Absolutely stumped... when I read some of these reviews on Shenandoah.I was certain that all the reviews would have been ALL 5 stars. Shenandoah was a beautiful movie, and the acting was just superb.Not many movies of today make you want to boil your eyes out crying, and send your humour or emotions flying. Clearly alot of people cannot appreciate alot of movies from jimmy's era. My advise is, dont post reviews if you do not know what your talking about!!!"
3,"Unremarkable, depressing and ultimately unsatisfying American Civil War drama","""Shenandoah"" tells the tale of a large family caught in the crossfire of the American Civil War. The family's patriarch played by James Stewart is determined to ignore the war even as it rages around his Virginia farm but in the end he and his family cannot avoid it.This somewhat artificial situation is a lens through which the viewer can experience the agony of the civil war. Being made in 1965 the film still has older western conventions such as the courtship, the wedding and a big fist-fight but also features some ""modern"" touches such as its downbeat tone and lack of any real resolution. Unfortunately the director never takes this combination anywhere particulary interesting so we are left with an unremarkable, depressing and ultimately unsatisfying film. Stewart is excellent and the film is not without merits but one can't help wondering what Peckinpah could have made of this material."
5,nice reading book,My daughter likes to read this book very much. It would be good if in modern school kids lean to read using book like this.
2,Couldn't fool a real 11-year-old hockey player!,"My son read this book and found it ""deameaning"" because so much of the hockey information was inaccurate. He felt that the hockey premise was deceitful and the author only used it to draw boys in, but didn't do the research to make it believable. Kids know when they're being duped!"
4,Bindaas Collection,"This is a awesum out of this world kind, man. This collection is really good and priceless. It's an collector's dream to have a collection of this kind in their kitty."
2,Needs A Heavy Dose of OOMPH !,"This album definitely catches up with the times and sounds mature. It even has a very introspective sound.It's not just the song dedicated to Wendy Melvoin's brother Jonathon that stands out with such sentimentality, but the other tracks share that same quality. However, enough is enough. You are left craving for something a little more up-beat; Not necessarily in the sense of dance music (more oomph, if you will). It's almost like the more toned down version of an Alanis Morissette album.This is one time where I feel like this album requires more style than substance. It's just too heavy to listen to at times. It also resembles a watered-down or diluted version of their Wendy & Lisa debut album from '87 ( and that album was excellent!)."
3,A good album overall,"Like other Wendy and Lisa recordings, there are some fine pieces here...and others that are less than fine. Good musicians, average vocalists. If you've enjoyed their earlier work, you'll like this as well."
3,Two great songs,"""Reaching One"" and ""Let's Say"" are two absolutely stunning songs, incredible arrangements. The rest is so-so, but certainly pleasant to hear. But wow, when they hit the target they really scored. I just ran into this CD, glad I did."
5,Buy this.,"Wendy & Lisa have always been great musicians and great songwriters; this is their most personal and sincere work to date. I think Girl Bros is one of those rare albums that could please almost everyone. This is better alternative than what you hear on alternative radio, but equally accessible. This is sophisticated yet very listenable pop music. And Wendy & Lisa's funk roots, while understated this time, are still here. And though Girl Bros has a theme of death, Wendy & Lisa explore not just grief and sadness but all the associated emotions here, including love and joy and fearlessness. This is an album you shouldn't pass up."
5,well written and clear,"This is simply the best single text on writing. It is well written and clear. It covers all the aspects of mechanics that are necessary for good writing. It also gives the necessary teaching about proper grammar. There are many good (as well as confusing) books on the market about this topic, but, for me, this is the ""writing bible."" I have multiple copies of this book so I can loan them out from time to time, but I also have a personal copy at home as well as at work that no one gets to ""touch"" except me. I recommend this text to all my students."
1,Lies.,"First of all they lied. The seller said this product was in very good condition. Very good is used with maybe a few signs of wear. This book was mostly highlighted, had a lot of writing in it, and it had a few stains from food most likely. Also, this book had ring binding that was broken at the top. I am very disappointed in this product. This book was at most OK. And, it took a long time to get here. I ordered it on the 9th and received it on the 23rd. I will not buy from this seller again and would not recommend it to anybody i know either. All in all, very disappointed."
3,Depending on what your looking for....,"Yes FLEX is a good magazine (I've been a subscriber for many years), however it depends on what is it that you're looking for in weightlifting and nutrition. If you inspire to look like these gentlemen on the covers of FLEX, ok. But if your looking to be fit, eat healthy, be active, FLEX might be a little to much for you. After a while you'll realize that you will not (and would not want to) look like most of these giants of the sport. On a positive side, the pictures and routines are very helpfull and motivating. And their nutrition articles are helpfull too."
1,Nothing but a catalog,"This ""catalog"" is so full of advertisements that you really have to dig to find any content at all in it. The overwhelming number of ads in this magazine make it impossible to read through even a single article. Whenever this magazine shows up in my mailbox it goes straight into the recycling bin without even a single glance inside. I can't wait for the subscription to end. The only benefit this magazine has is that it's helping keep the postal service afloat (I hope)."
5,Better than I thought,"This magazine surprised me when I picked up the October 04 issue. I had expected it to be as bad, if not worse than Muscle and Fitness, a magazine of rehashed info. The issue I picked up, however, had articles on upcoming, and top bodybuilders.Full of color photos, the magazine is great motivation, and the workout info is great as well. I do, however agree, that most of the guys in there are probably juiced so much, an average guy shouldn't think he'll get that physique.All in all, good info, good motivation (images)."
2,developed excellently but in vain!,"Hold it! The Church may hear! Ssshhh... Okay... Well, this book reveals the politics inside the Church and I really like West's explicit account of which. It shows that he once really worked in the Vatican. So, the story was carefully planned, dramatically conveyed and expertly rehearsed. Untillll.... the most unrealistic ending and the worst climax! Disgusting. But try it if you go for ultra-fictional novels!"
3,Far-fetched,"The interesting thing about this book is its comment on the 80s - a time of increasing almost frenzied worry that a nuclear war was about to break out. Indeed, I remember the 80s, growing up as a schook kid, very much in the shadows of movies such as ""The Day after"". This book captures the spirit of the time and it is valuable in that respect. However, the plot did not do much for me. What is interesting is how we have moved on from the fear of nuclear holocaust to the feat of environment catastrophe - are we not a litte obssessed with Armaggedon scenarios?"
5,wonderfully moving,This was a re-read and it was just as profound and moving as it was the first time I read it. Morris L. West is one of the best.
5,A Re-Read,"I read this book many years ago and when I saw it on Amazon, I could not wait to read it again. There is much intrigue and danger. Loved it!"
3,"Interesting beginning, implausible ending","The book got me going with an interesting premise: a Pope basically forced into retirement because he claims to have had a private revelation from God about the end of the world. As usual, Morris West produces some interesting character studies as the book develops. However, as others have said, the ending was a major disappointment that made me feel somewhat like I'd wasted my time reading the book only to get an ending like that."
5,Honest to God.,"Contrary to the reviewer from Scottsdale, Arizona, I don't see The Clowns of God as an attack on Catholicism. In fact, in many ways I sensed a respect and honor for the institution and the various positions of office. I saw it as an affirmation of God but also an honest look at the possiblity of human corruption. West did an excellent job of dealing with the religious aspect of the book. I think the book was written in such away that anyone with religious beliefs could comfortably read it.The point was not to slam Catholicism, but to use it as a vehicle to tell a story. A similar novel could have been written from a Protestant viewpoint and context, but Morris chose to write about what he was familiar with and therein lies his strength. His books are researched and developed to the point of making the characters and situations believable. It was a worth-while read, especially for anyone interested in spiritual and philosophical ideas."
4,Is the end of the world approaching?,"What would happen, if the members of the Roman Curia discovered that the Pope was about to publically state that he had received a private revelation that the world was about to end? This is the fundamental premise of this exciting novel by the author of ""The Shoes of the Fisherman"". This book has as many ""twists and turns"" as a spy novel, with the additional interest of having the Pope as the main character. The ending will shock and surprise most readers. Considering the popularity of the ""Left Behind"" series, this book is one which should generate real interest (and is better written and far more believable) among believers and non-believers alike."
4,Classic,"This is Fitzgerald's first attempt at novel. Considering that this was written by a 23 year old it is amazing. The middle third or so of the book is written as play, where the main character Amory gets involved with a girl. The main character was very irritating. His time as Princeton was described in brilliant detail though. The plot seems disjointed, but somehow it makes sense. If you are a fan of Fitzgerald this book is highly recommended."
4,A quality first novel.,"This Side of Paradise is Fitzgerald's first novel and compared to most first novels, it is one of high quality. It is primarily a character study of Amory Blaine ,a young man of romantic temperament who lives off the inheritance form his wealthy mother. Blaine and his relationships with his male friends at Princeton both during and after college are one part of the book.His sense of purposelessness and his relationships with women are the other major themes of the book.Blaine is not a likable protagonist but Fitzgerald makes him compelling and his strong ear for dialogue and wonderful writing style plus some interesting secondary characters make the novel a winner"
3,Summer reading,This classic was needed by my daughter for her summer reading assignment for freshmen year. Even though I ordered the book mid July I didn't receive it until almost the end of August. That is my only complaint. Thank goodness she is a good reader and got it done before school.
5,Or: The Confessions of F. Scott Fitzgerald?,"The writer of the most poetical prose in American literature delivers his first and most nakedly autobiographical novel. Amory Blain, Fitzgerald's stand-in, is a likable lad, and we trace his early years in Minnesota to his career at Princeton, to WWI and his marriage to a temperamental beauty from the deep south. A hallmark of Fitzgerald is that he recreates and preserves his era's mores and values, its class distinctions and its peculiarities so deftly, one feels a part of them within a very few pages."
5,argh,just perusing the reviews and was frustrated to find out the possible ending. don't think they should have said that amory is rejected. I haven't finished the book yet but I'm pretty sure that is an important turning point.
5,Nice,"It's a shame modern Princeton (or any other college) is not half as wondereful. Nice book, great in parts. It's a good thing Fitzgerald didn't graduate from Princeton, he never would have been even a halfway decent writer then."
1,Great Writer-Terrible Book,"Fitzgerald is obviously one of America's greatest modern writers-his prose style and use of language is amazing and The Great Gatsby is a classic that everyone should own and re-read on a regular basis. Yet this book, his first, has one of the most obnoxious, least-likeable protagonists in American literature- Amory Blaine. Blaine is arrogant, self-centered, self-important, and a pompous windbag; yet not in an interesting way such as Holden Caufield. Also, Fitzgerald's description of the idealism of Ivy League life and society is so corny and hokey that it is difficult to read at times.Of course, the book has its merits for the fact that it is the first novel of a great novelist and it contains the seeds of the literary style that he polished with later works. You can still find insights and character descriptions that lesser authors could only hope to create."
2,Puerile,"Sorry to disagree with most everybody writing their reviews but Fitzgerald failed miserably at getting down to the nitty-gritty of the human condition. He reminded me of the clueless politicians we have in Washington debating health care issues or national defense. Like our politicians, Amory was selfish, pompous, obnoxious and what's perhaps even more inexcusable considering his education, a dim-wit. Fitzgerald's vision doesn't penetrate beneath the surface of our daily lives. His characters are terribly vapid, philistines, bourgois to the max. I tell you what, Amory deserved the ass-kicking he received. I only wish I could have got in a few punches on Amory and Fitzgerald. And his entire rap at the end of the book was nauseatingly peurile. The novel was pure bull."
5,"Youth, ambition, and romance!","This book is perhaps my favorite of all Fitzgerald's works. Unlike Gatsby, with its high drama and giant archetypes, This Other Paradise is a book of subtlety. Amory Blaine is one of Fitzgerald's best drawn protagonists, perhaps because he is is Fitzgerald himself. Reading this book, you can't help but feel young, idealistic, and full of innocence."
2,Just didn't appeal to me.,"I don't know why. I liked The Great Gatsby. I love Fitzgerald's short stories. But I just couldn't get into this book. It took me months to make it halfway through because I'd put it down and read a few other books before picking it back up. When I realized I was looking at finishing the book as a chore instead of a leisure activity, I moved on completely. I'll just have to live with not knowing what happened in Amory's life."
4,Great,I was really intrigued by this book and Fitzgerald's style of writing. Amory Blaine is a character that will stick with you forever.
2,lucky he wasn't discouraged,So dated it annoys. The language seems made up at times. I know this was not supposed to be Fitzgerald's best work but I read Gatsby when I was young and loved it I don't love this book
2,lover of books&stories,"Ive tried to finish this book twice,&both times I was bored to pieces&unable to complete it! I finally donated it to the Goodwill"
3,Glad I have in-text dictionary,"This is a difficult read. I am glad that I am able to select a word and it will give me a brief definition because Fitzgerald uses a lot of out-dated, obsolete, and fringe words. It is almost as if he feels he needs to prove he attended college by using these words that (I don't think) were ever in popular verbiage. I have not read the entire story (my kindle fire informs me I have read 25%), so I don't know about the plot, but so far it is nothing ""to write home about."""
2,Somebody should just slap this twit,"Few have had the balls to call this book the pretentious pseudo-intellectual twaddle that it is. Amory, a spoiled rich boy, goes to the best schools mommy can buy, but squanders his time there partying and worrying about the cut of his clothes, while becoming a smug, poetry spouting phony. After an undistinguished hitch in the army, he realizes he is too good to work, and toys with several women while becoming an alcoholic and subjecting the reader to lots of bad poetry. Finally, he turns into a political bore, spewing Fitzgerald's socialist propaganda, and wanders the earth insulting innocent people.An episode in one of Amory's shallow affairs, in which he and his girl-squeeze of the moment take a break from reciting poetry at each other to wallow in sociopathic self pity after she has murdered her horse in a narcissistic fit, is particularly disturbing."
1,How did this ever get published?,"This is the worst book I've ever read. It's inconceivable that his next book was The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald spends way too much time on late night bull sessions, but then skips over Amory's military service in World War I. Did anything happen to Amory while he was there? A great alternative to sleeping aids."
4,A story that still carries relevance today,"Man, this was good. It has aged well since it was written in 1919 and published the next year. The story is pretty much the life of Amory, the main character who is clearly based on Fitzgerald himself. The story is, for the most part, Fitzgerald's life. All of his happiness and sorrow, mostly sorrow, was poured into this novel. This is definitely one of the books you must read in your lifetime."
2,utterly pointless,"I suppose it's supposed to be intentional that no character in this book is very well-drawn. I suppose it's supposed to be intentional that not even Armory is very interesting. I suppose it's supposed to be intentional that you can't remember a single thing about a chapter two chapters later.But is it intentional that this book is supposed to be so dull?Armory goes through life, makes friends, gets girlfriends, breaks up with girlfriends. But you don't remember any of them because they are all reflections of Armory himself. Yet he's dull. So a reflection of a rock is not much to take home. It would be nice if just ONE character held your interest. If just ONE episode was expanded so we got to know these people a little more, but the main character is off doing other things instead.Autobiographical novels are fairly popular, however when the author has no insights into his own life, they are very useless in the long run."
1,A horrible addition to the American Literature....,"... which is already lacking...I have read a huge amount of books in my life and I have never read anything more boring than this book. The conversations like ""Amory, my darling"" and ""Beatrice, my darling"" made me sick to my stomach. I mean, did people really speak like that? The poetry referenced seemed endless.....there was no structure....it was incredibly hard to follow...and, overall, was just very UNinteresting..."
5,Happy customer,Barrys tea from Ireland is excellent. My husband got me hooked on it. It's full of flavor and yummy with a little milk and sugar.
4,Wonderful Breakfast Tea!,I was actually devastated when the only local store carrying Barry's closed down! The tea is one of the best I'd ever had. It has a bouquet that adds to the flavor. I recommend it to anyone who is a tea drinker to add this to their stock.
3,OK but . . .,"A jaded, slanted view of Murrow. If you are like me and welcome different opinions, it is worth watching, but not worth owning unforntunately. It took a few cheap shots at a dead man, but also did a good job of covering his life overall."
4,Rex Pro Your flexible friend....,"I have owned a Rex Pro now for 18 months and have found it very useful. It's size means that it fits easily in my wallet and the syncronisation with Outlook 97/98 and 2000 is superb. I realised just how good it was when the batteries went flat I had to live a day without it!My only concerns to give to future buyers would be... 1. Buy the optional hard cover to stop it flexing in your pocket, it feels very easy to break and even though I have got the hard cover I've managed to damage my screen, although it still works! 2. The interface when undocked in rubbish. Typing into this device is a clumsy and offen tedious experience, don't as I have try to take down messages while somebody talks to you!Even with these problems the fact that you can carry it anywhere without even trying makes it well worth the money..."
2,Rex Doesn't Work With Windows ME!,"I purchased the Rex after reading a number of excellent reviews, including many from people who had purchased the unit to ""sync"" with their Windows applications, particularly Outlook. I was disappointed to learn later that the Rex does not presently sync with Windows ME or its version of Outlook. Given the number of keystrokes required to enter even small items of info on Rex manually, the Rex is of little use to anyone with Windows ME. Xircom confirms the Rex does not presently sync with Windows ME, although they say they're working on it."
2,Not tough enough for real life,"I really like this product, in concept and in practice. So much so, that I have replaced it *twice in a six months*. But I have finally decided that I cannot use one long-term, because the screen breaks too easily.The thing is designed to be pocket-size, but the manual points out that it is not really safe to carry in most pockets, briefcases or handbags. Unfortunately, they mean it! The screen cracks fairly easily under real-life conditions faced in any of these common places.On the other hand, maybe I am just a scrub. People who dress more business-like might not have this problem. The only safe and useful place I have found to put the thing, in my wardrobe, would a front shirt- or coat- pocket. But I do not dress far enough up on the food-chain to have one of those every day."
2,Don't Buy!,"I purchased three Rex's for myself and two other peopleon the advice of my friend who liked the product.Within a month, all three Rex's broke. The product is terrible! I was attracted by the product's low price and miniature size which still makes it attractive. However, I warn that the size actually becomes a big problem because it breaks VERY easily and don't be conned into believing that the product is a great fit for your wallet because it WILL break if you leave it there. The Rex comes with a hard plastic shell thats poorly designed so its hard to put in and take out of and considerably adds to the Rex's size so it no longer fits into your wallet. For the budget conscious, I'd strongly recommend paying a little more and buying the palm m100 or Handspring Visor - those will be so much more worth the purchase if you aren't too qualmy about the size. In any case, the Rex doesn't nearly compare to these in terms of functionality or ease of use."
2,Great Concept but not easy to use,"Cool little machine once I worked out how to use it (as the instructions don't tell you). It so much better than carrying diaries/day timers around with you. The docking station and TrueSync are a great idea but not that straight forward. Its a lot quicker to add all your info from your PC or laptop using this however when it come to synchronising from you PC to the REX that's when the problems start. I spent nearly 1 hour of the phone to the help line and got them to go through it. Saying that, I still have problems with it. But, if you are a wizard on the computers and not a technophobe like me you should be OK."
1,Don't do business with Ben Franklin,"Well, I can't review this product, because this is not the product I received. Apparently, Poulan discontinued it. So Ben Franklin took it upon themselves to send me a completely different product. Then charged my credit card with the original amount. I returned the incorrect product right away and almost a month later, have still not gotten a credit on my credit card. So I've been paying interest on a product I didn't order, didn't want, and returned.I've ordered many things online through Amazon, and never had a problem. But I will never do business with Ben Franklin again."
5,Great saw,"One year ago, I purchased the Black & Decker NPP2018 cordless pole saw.One year later, IT DIDN'T WORK!, even after the battery was charged for more than 24 hours.I only used it ONE time last year. So I bought a Poulan 810 EPT.I used the Poulan for the first time today, and it was a greatpole saw. The corded electric saw is far more superior to thecordless B&D;, when the cordless did work. The saw is much faster, andthe speed was constant.The only problem I have with the Poulan, is it doesn't comewith a chain cover."
5,"Great yard tool, plus, plus","Almost bought a cordless pruner then found this on Amazon. Couldn't be more impressed with the saw and it won't run down like a cordless would. More than enough power for 6"" branches.AND, it came with a bonus weed trimmer attachment and all this with free shipping!Also, this Poulan electric power head accepts ""Expand-it"" attachments which are very reasonably priced. I already bought/added a hedge trimmer attachment which also works great.The Poulan 810 EPT is very highly recommended for numerous yard jobs."
1,Product Support Non-existent,"Purchased form Amazon, lasted 20 minutes before it broke. I was told to take it to a brick and mortar store for warrantee work. They were unhappy that I brought it in. They have no parts for this tool and they cant give me a date for repair, it has been two weeks now. In fact, they told me that if purchased from them there is an over the counter exchange policy. This tool should be replaced rather than repaired when it is new. The repair could cost more than the original purchase price. If you buy this tool over the web, don't expect any support from the either seller or the manufacturer."
1,Amazon Service,"I would rate this tool, if I had it. Amazon listed it as ""in stock"" when I ordered it. However, the ship date on my account record shows approximate ship date in 6 weeks. Amazon will not allow me to cancel item because they say it is in ""the shipping process"". Poor Service"
5,Great little pruner,"Had my Poulan for a week and been cleaning up low hanging limbs easily. It arrived in great shape, easy to assemble and just the machine for getting the job done. If you've ever used a chain saw, we live in rural Oregon and heat with wood, then you'll appreciate how quiet it is. I only wish someone would make one to extend 30 ft or more and still be manageable, so we could eliminate the need for a logger or tree trimming service."
3,was as advertised,i think some better instructions should of been included no warranty booklet just what's on the box. everything was good except the box was damaged and the oil for the machine spilled all over the box. once i purchased the oil everything was fine.
5,Outstanding Product,"Upon receiving my new pole saw, I used it immediately. It was all that I was looking for. Could not have selected a better piece of equipment."
1,Another negative vote for this product,"Same kind of plastic shaft coupling failure that others have experienced. Same run-around from local Poulan repair shop. Same frustrating experience from Poulan trying to get warranty replacement (they finally did replace the unit). The product is good -- while it works. But anything more than what you can cut with a manual pole pruner (~1"") seems to overload the shaft coupling. I'm afraid to use the tiller attachment becasue it seems like it would be a much heavier load on the coupling. This must have been designed by the Poulan CEO's idiot son and no one has guts enough to fix it."
2,Wasn't Good Like the First One,"This one wasn't good like the first one. It made sense, but he didn't put on the perfromance, so I have to give the is one a low . Sorry, but it just wasn't good."
1,"I rather have root canal, then sit through this again!","This film which aired on HBO a few months ago makes you realize why it was never released to video. The acting is abysmal, the special effects can't even save this one! Screaming Mad George (Special Effects Wizard), shame on you for lending your talents to this one!"
1,I THOGHT IT SUCKED!!!!!,I really liked the first one alot. and then I rented this lame excuse of a movie. And just how did he survive after getting shot in the head multiple times with a friggin' nail gun. And he's just driving away laughing!!! How stupid!!! It started off all slow and then turned into a slasher movie!! And it isn't so damn cool like the original. But Bernsen was good as usual.
1,THIS IS A HORRIBLE MOVIE.,THE MOVIE IS HORRIBLE. THE ACTING IS EXTREMELY HORRIBLE. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!!!
2,Those who liked this movie cant be serious,"I must addmit that I dont have seen the first movie, but after I saw this one I dont want to see it. Corbin Bernsen as Dr. Cane goes around and torture people. I dont find this very entertament. BUT: Corbin Bernsen can act, oh my he is an good acter. At the start the movie was ok, but the ending was really disaponting."
1,GGGRRRROOOOSSSSEEEE!!!!!!!!!,"AAAHHH!!!! This movie is even worse than the 1st. Its sooo bad, it doesnt even deserve a review. Definitley not one for squemish."
4,Dental Illness...,"Corbin Bernsen returns as the hilariously homicidal Dr. Feinstone in THE DENTIST 2: BRACE YOURSELF. He escapes from the mental institution, and sets up shop in the small, rural town of Paradise (after the ""accidental"" death of the town dentist). The unwary folks have no idea who it is that's poking around in their mouths! This time, Feinstone falls for a local gal, while his vengeful, ex-wife (Linda Hoffman) tries to track him down. While not as insanely fun as the original, this sequel is still worth several repeat visits..."
5,Everybody likes it and it is really useful,"Everything about this watch is nice. I love it because it is a tough resistant watch and, at the same time it is really elegant so you can use it to hang around and to dress up too."
4,"great quality, didn't fit","Great quality, but I took away a star because it didn't fit my peanut lighter. I realize that's not the product's fault. It's just frustrating that it's difficult to buy exactly the correct size when you start dealing with small devices with little room for error. I probably would give it 5 stars if it fit like I expected it would."
4,Swing at it's Best,"Swingerhead does a great job in their first cd. The music and lyrics are original and keep you hopping. The title track song : She could be a Spy will have you tapping your feet and singing along in no time. Lifts the spirits, and gets you dancing. I look forward to more work from Swingerhead. Drums, brass, guitar and a lead swinger that can't be beat. Michael Andrews has the voice of a crooner and this cd is a great taste of the talent this group possesses."
5,Swing On Swingerhead!,"This CD is great! Swingerhead is a band with style. They can jump from classic to rockabilly to an upbeat modern sound, while still sticking close to there roots. This is what swing should be, the vocals are excellent and the arrangments pull you up on your feet. Swinger head is a best bet to get you moving!"
5,Swingerhead is AWSOME - live and on the CD!,"I've been devoted to Michael ANdrew and Swingerhead since I saw his musical ""Micky Swingerhead and the Earth Girls"". ""She Could Be a Spy"" carries on the fun and excitement that the Rat Pack are known for. Get the CD! and get to Orlando FL to check out this swingin' band! -DR Baker, Los Angeles"
4,ILLuminator Redux,"Nice quality, very fine detail, very functional, only gripe ishow short the illumination lasts, even 3 seconds it too shortbut i love the silent lighted alarm."
4,PSP kit,I bought this accessory kit as a gift to my nephew to keep his PSP 3000. He loves it and uses every single accessory in the kit. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a PSP it is very handy and convenient a good product my money well spent.
3,Way too religious,"This book has great letters for very religious folks (numerous references to God, etc.), but I do not believe it reflects how everyday folks express themselves. Would only recommend to a very religious person."
4,She loves it but....,I've had to sew the ball three times since purchase. My little dog is rough on toys and this one has opened in several places. It has a tough squeaker which is great for her.
4,Our Yorkie loves these!!!,"These are our 6yr old Yorkie's favorite toy. We used to buy them at our local grocery store, but they no longer carry them. It's great to find them online, and at a better price!"
1,Poorly Manufactured,"My six pound little Pomeranian was able to pull the stitching apart on this ball within a matter of 5 minutes. When my wife sewed the ball back together, my Pomeranian was able to pull apart stitching from another section of the ball. Ball is not made for dogs. I was very disappointed in the quality of this product."
3,Dog toy for playful boxer,"I rec'd the shipment early, service was great. However it only took about 4 hours to gut the ball of stuffing. I wish they were a little bit more sturdy."
4,Always arrives on time/,"Great magazines at a great price. Took a while to get the first one, but once the first one came the others arrived promptly one even a month ahead!"
1,Fluff,"I recently re-subscribed to ""Bicycling"" hoping that they'd changed their ways but unfortunately over the years (as some have already eluded to) the magazine is still a waste of valuable trees. It has lost it's edge and integrity as a genuine cycling magazine only to be filled with fluff and more fluff. The writing has mostly been replaced by repetitive eye candy for weight weenies, Lance wannabees and the summer fred and does little to bridge the gap in the variety of bicycles, cyclists, and cycling styles and needs.Maybe it has to do with the market's share going to mountain bike mags (5 out of 6 in my local market) or maybe the same cookie cutter bikes it features every month are just fast money, a sure thing marketed to the before mention riders. I don't know. What I do know is that I will let my subscription run out and continue to enjoy ""Bicycle Quarterly..."" I just wish it was monthly."
1,Pathetic excuse for a magazine,"I have given up on this magazine due to its pathetically poor content. Less than one star if that was an option. It was delivered to me free for about two years as part of a membership promotion. It started poor and has continued to decline. If I read something I want to learn or be entertained. Bicycling magazine fails in both regards. Now that the promotion is over there is no way I will spend money to receive it each month. Much better to read Cycling Plus from the UK, which is written in an intelligent manner and provides in depth reviews and news articles."
2,oops,sadly I found myself in agreement with those who note the declining quality of this magazine. This used to be the first point of call for cycling enthusiasts but somehow they have now identified an imaginary readership who are both willing to buy super-expensivee components and yet who have no knowledge of the sport. Someone must have persuaded them that this was an advancing demographic.
2,Bike mag,This magazine is ok. I didn't get too much out of it that I didn't already know about riding bikes. I think that this would be great for someone just getting into it or back into it.
3,mediocrity has its virtues,"Publications like BICYCLING practically define narrow-casting. Aimed at a modest population that throbs with interest in their shared pursuit, a magazine like this one has to meet elevated expectations and yet recruit enough advertisers to pay the bottom line and maintain an accessible price.The result is almost doomed to be something of a hybrid.In my book, that's just ok. I read BICYCLING as much for the gear as for the articles on new products, new workouts, and exotic rides. Some months, I'm in it for the advertisements, sometimes for the review, sometimes for the workouts, sometimes just for the sheer pleasure of turning the pages and seeing what I can see.That's what one should expect from a magazine like this one. It's not philosophy, not rocket science, and not a training manual for the Tour. It's just BICYCLING. That's pretty cool."
1,terrible magazine,"During the 1970s, Bicycling was a great magazine with lots of in-depth articles about bike tours, bike racing, and bicycle technology. The magazine zoomed downhill through the 1990s into the worthless rag that it is now. The articles in the current version of the magazine are very superficial and lifeless. Many are thinly veiled press releases from various advertisers. If you really want to learn about road bicycles and bicycling, a much better magazineis *CyclingPlus*. For mountain biking, try *Bike* or *Dirt Rag*."
2,A poor excuse for a bike magazine,"I found this magazine to be pretty disappointing:-Lots of uninformitive articles: like ""15 secrets you can really use,"" ""18 things only insiders know,"" ""Ride like a pro,"" it sounds more like a fashion or diet magazine. All the articles have titles that imply good information but when you read them they lack substance.- Bike tips that are impracticle or obvious.-Lots of product reviews that give no good information: instead they tell you how good the bike looks, what material it's made from, if it's high/low priced, what quality line the drive train is, how your friends will like it... they state the obvious and point out things you can figure out for yourself.-There is a ""style man"" section in the back that tells you what biking clothes look good, and what is out of fasion?-Lots of advertisements.-Anti-triathlete comments in some articlesI only read about 3 of these before I stopped, sometimes I wondered if the editors were even bikers themselves."
1,things were better in the good old days,"Used to subscribe and still do pick one up on occasion but it ain't what it used to be. Started reading this in the 70's and it wasn't bad--then. It would actually take sides orstate an opinion. Now it is a slave to advertising--lots of fluff, no real stuff and vanishing little real information. The cyclists that used to run the magazine rode off into the sunset. Rodale Press--who gives us that nearly useless Organic Gardening--took over and it'll take an ownership change to bring it back. I buy one or two a year to see if anything has changed--it hasn't. A waste of paper more often than not. One star because of the rare nugget in the waste--otherwise ""0"" stars."
2,Not What it Used to Be...,"Years ago, I used to be a staunch reader of Bicycling (even when it had that ridiculous exclaimation point in the title). Unfortunately, I have to agree with most of the reviewers here, the content has declined dramatically. Mostly fluff, and reviews that don't have much merit.Too bad, the cycling market has seen a solid rejuvination in the last few years and the market is primed for a good, USEFUL publication, unfortunately Bicycling isn't it."
2,Really pretty sad...,"This is a pretty sad magazine. It's like Seventeen for cyclists really. I can't believe i used to actually take it seriously. Fortunately i know better now, but sheesh. It's just stupid and worthless info that is only occasionally compensated for by good pictures of new bikes. If you want to see new bikes, go to your local bike shop and actually ride them. Don't buy a magazine. The advice is stupid to the point of almost being gossip. Try Cyclesport if you like to follow racing... i have no suggestions for just all around road biking, however."
1,World's leading bike magazine?,"Leading on what? Innovation, quality articles, coverage, reader satisfaction? No sir.Profit from advertising, volume sales, high percentual of biased articles? Most likely.Unfortunately, to boost profits Rodale press is up to anything, like rerun of old articles to save money and misleading ""special advertising"" sections. If you are into Mt. Biking, there are better magazines out there (Mountain Biking Magazine is not one of them, of course). If your thing is road biking, sorry, there is nothing else except racing magazines. As we know, America is about vehicles that waste energy, like high-powered cars, motorcycles and boats (just count the number of magazines about them next time you stop at your favorite bookstore)."
2,A disappointment,"As an avid bike rider, I thought I would like this magazine. Instead, I find it to be mediocre at best. The writers have that ""we're pros and you guys will never be as good as us"" attitude. I used to read this magazine years ago and it was good reading. I think I let my old subscription end, because the articles were starting to have that ""snooty"" feel."
2,Just repeats the same articles every month,You will think this is a good magazine the first couple of times you read t and then it will start to occur to you that you are reading the same thing over and over. The articles are repackaged but it is just the same stuff. This is quite common with Rodale magazines.
3,Bicycling...,"Expected a little more techie stuff, more bike testing and more tips from the good fellas, but for reading material, it's entertaining and lite, good for lunch time, plane waiting or before napping.Still, it's my first issue and would love to read the after Giro, after Tour and after Vuelta de Spain issues to see what comes along.Loved the right breakfast article, and real sad that the new Madone article was only half a page review and a centerfold flash look.Still, liked the magazine so far."
2,Used to be better...,"For what it is, this magazine is OK -- a short digest of info for dilettantes. It has been ""dumbed down"" (please don't take that term too perjoratively) recently to attract a wider spectrum of readers, it would seem. It still has some useful info and is in my opinion worth the inexpensive subscription price.But hard-core cyclists may want to try a different magazine.I would prefer more (and more detailed) product reviews, maintenance tips, advice/tips."
2,It's an o.k. Case...but...,"...you might've expected more from Targus. Perhaps this works fine with the Palm devices, but with pocket PC's (at least the Aero 1550)...no way! For starters, it's got an uncomfortable security rail for the Palms, which gets in the way of your Pocket PC. But most importantly...once you get your PPC, credit cards, money, check book, receipts, etc. you end up with a non-practical bulky huge case which is hard to fit almost anywhere. I mean...I use it for traveling, but on a daily basis, I rather use the simple case that came along with my PPC"
4,Good fit for iPaq,"Well-made case, very good materials and workmanship. It is very large for a Palm or Visor, but it's a perfect fit for the iPaq with the CF card sleeve, which many cases won't accomodate."
3,Good case,Not a Bad case - Use it with my Psion 5 - some protection from the padding. Good alternative to the Zipper style cases.
5,Takes Me Higher!,"Eddie James is an unsung artist in my opinion. His music is awesome! He is inspirational and you just cant sit still. You will smile, hum, bob your head and say Halleluiah!! Just wonderful!"
4,Flat Spare Tires Are A Pain,"A flat or low pressure spare tire = no spare tire! But spares are a pain to check and inflate. Mine are always buried in a well under a cover and with various tools on top. Some have spares mounted under the car. The inconvenient inaccessibility is why spares are so often flat. This brass and rubber extender enables me to snake the fill tube to an easily accessed part of the car. Now checking the spare tire pressure and adding air doesn't require digging out the tire or crawling under the car. I would give it 5 stars, but have to see how well it holds up over time. If it is anything like their well-built Accu-gage EZ - Air Tire Gauge, I won't be disappointed."
4,accu-gage,this worked great on my 2007 tacoma spare tire since it has a pressure thing on my spare tire and i need to put air in with out having to take it out under the pickup . so now if it shows low on air i can fill it up with this hose still attached i gave it four because i dont know how long it will last under the truck it may be a five star in few years for quality.
1,leaky gauge,"I ordered two valve extenders, one of which leaks. Very disappointing - to have to do the install process twice in a difficult to reach location - for a device that's supposed to save trouble."
2,50/50 chance of success,"I bought two of these. One was for my car and the other was for my truck. I installed one on my car first. I kept an eye on it for a few weeks and all was fine. I installed the other one on my truck and the spare was flat the next day. Checking with some soapy water, I found a leak at the fitting that threads on to the tire valve right where the crimped piece is connected to the knurled piece. I won't bother getting anymore of these in the future."
3,Book Review,I bought this book as a resource for a study on the Book of Ruth --- sorry to say it does not seem to add too much insight
3,A bit disappointed in the author.,"While there is quite a lot of interesting information and sometimes an interesting perspective because of the author's expertise in Hebrew, a lot of the time the commentary almost sounded like it was coming from a secular perspective. This surprised me because I did not think that about other authors in this series. However, I still found it very interesting."
5,Amazing Sax,"I have just experienced Ethnifusion for the very first time. WOW. not only is the rythm section one of the tightest units i have ever heard, the guitar phrasing out of this world, but who is this sax player? we will be hearing a great deal more from him I am sure, WOW. His phrasing his thoughts, all seem to be right in your face the entire time. Magnificient Bravo... I hope to see you all in the future, keep tooting my man"
4,"Dance, ambient, ebm, best served chilled","Im not one for singles, but Less is one of those rare tracks that deserves a cd of its own. Perhaps best labeled as ""German industrial pop,"" Haujobb explores a more chilled ebm style, with flowing ambient and melancholy tonalities that provides an entrance into more of a contemplative realm than dancish. The remixes dont quite compare to the original, but prolong the tempo a little bit longer for the listener to really get an appreciation of the atmosphere combined with Vanessa Briggs' vocals. Pick this one up if you've got a hankerin' for a single."
2,"Deceptive description beware, there are not 12 cones.","This is a 12 inch cone. When I ordered it the picture showed more than one cone so I expected to find 12 cones. Bad assumption on my part.I'll give it two stars because the cone itself seems ok, heavy enough to be stable. The plastic is very stinky though, kinda permeates the room and makes me slightly worried about inhaling plasticizers.I don't have energy to pursue getting a refund and with shipping and all it wouldn't be worth it.This one goes in the garage."
5,Amazing,This book is great. I read it and I did all of the extersizes in it. The book is wonderful. Its the only book that I read that looked back into it (only for the extersizes inside it). I would recoment it to every teen.
3,Academic Text,"Fairly good text book, while it explained the use and need for CLD's it fails to provide a first reader on how to actually draw the loops! It does not guide or recoomend what software to use in doing the drawing... we are all not technical drawers....."
3,Pretty good if they could bind it correctly,Content is pretty good--but the publisher/binder needs to apply some systems thinking to their assembly process. All of the pages from 63 on are upside down!
1,Poor Customer Service,Never received this book. Had to drop class due to books never showing up. How do I get a refund?
2,Great disappointment from Great painters series,"Being great Roerich fans and being that there is so precious little available in print, myself and several friends were all bitterly disappointed with this otherwise very promising book. Ken Archer is undoubtedly a Roerich expert and all of our hopes were high. However, precious little information of a more than superficial nature was not forthcoming. Whilst the reproductions are good on the whole, some are reversed or wrongly titled....We had heard of this book many, many years ago and were eagerly anticipating what promised to be a great book on a spiritual artist dedicated to Beauty and to raising the vibrations of humanity through the Creative Fire. I am truly sorry that I cannot advise anybody to expect too much from this book. Far better...is the only other book currently available - by J. Decter titled: NICHOLAS ROERICH - THE LIFE & ART OF A RUSSIAN MASTER and this book I can thoroughly recommend."
3,Don't go by the picture,"The picture looked like my old one, but the description was different and I didn't catch the differences. These jars come with ""clover"" lids and square lids. The jars are different and lids not interchangable. Square jars are not flaired out at the top such as the picture represents. A more updated picture should be used."
4,All ok,"Item was received in time. It was intact and properly packaged.No problem with the vendor, whom I would recommend."
2,Buyer Beware,"Sent wrong type of glass jar (square vs clover leaf). I didn't have time to hassle with their customer service people, so I had to go out and buy a new top. Product came in approx 7 days, well packed. Wouldn't use this vendor again."
4,"Nice, untiring jazz","I just bought this album without knowing the authors or the quality of the music, but it was really a nice surprise and it's one of my all time favourite music albuns.Really nice music, sometimes a bit sad, or with a flavour of swing, beeing overall good stuff.Hear little Red :P"
4,eh,"I ordered theses earings and within a day they had called me to tell me that they weren't avaiable. The customer serveice rep i talked to was very nice and let me pick out different ones over the phone that were slightly more expensive. He wanted to charge me the difference, but did not after i pointed out that was no good. The earings i recieved are okay, but not great. They looked nicer in the picture. I'm rating this 4 stars instead of 3 since they were so nice on the phone. The product shipped write a way and i got it when it was promised."
2,Buy 'Richard Scarry's Best Counting Video' instead!,"This video, like so many other kids' media, inadvertantly demonstrates that learning is a burden.So often when a story shows a problem and then a solution, the lasting impression is of the negative rather than the positive. The net result is that they instill or worsen fears and bad habits instead of curing them.The good news in this case is that there is a wonderful alternative--in the very same vein--with no content problems whatsoever! Try 'Richard Scarry's Best Counting Video' instead!"
2,Not worth it,"This is like getting a collection of postcard, although the pictures are really nice, packaged in a really fancy, handmade paper holder. The pictures are also reproduced way too small to really appreciate them."
3,"Looks original, not built original","While this bumper looks very much like my original Ford step bumper - it's not built like the original one.You WILL need a mounting kit (sold separately) if you aren't up to building your own bumper mounts. The original ford mounts won't work.Also, the structural metal of this bumper is about 1/2 the thickness of the original Ford bumper."
5,Our wretched tax system and how it got that way.,This is a great overview of our wretched tax system and how it got that way.
1,Some simplistic ideas,"Simplifying taxes is a trap that every tax reformer falls into. Unfortunately I can tell you from having worked in the taxation field that the ""simpler"" the taxes, the less fair they are (and vice-versa)."
1,The Greedy Hand as described by a Yellow Belly,"If it's so bad, why doesn't she recommend a tax revolt? Cowardice.If a people love anything more than freedom, they will lose their freedom; and the irony is that if it is comfort or posessions they value more, they will lose those, too.Tired of the Lies from both major parties? Vote Libertarian."
1,Completly Wrong,This is what happens when your government is controlled by corporations. You pay them tons of money so they can give it to the rich and provides you nothing in return.
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah...","The book is totally off-point. The author ought to read the income tax laws before writing a book about the subject. Anyone interested in a ""new and improved"" tax law doesn't understand the present construction of the internal revenue code. We don't need a new system."
1,Junk food for the right wing.,It is a shame the author didn't read the tax code before writing this book. It is obvious she was unwilling to be encumbered by the facts. My right wing relatives love it. They also think of pork rinds as an entree.
2,Better Books Out There...,"If your expecting something new this book will be a disappointment...Privitization of Social Security, elimination of progressive taxation, etc. The only thing Shales is to be congradulated on is depicting the IRS only as a governmental agency doing its job and not some UN-sponsored New World Order Secret Society. If you have no background in economics and you believe this stuff already, you'll find this book agreeable. If you don't fit this description, look elsewhere"
2,Try again Ms. Shlaes,"After reading this book in its entirity I find many of Ms. Shlaes historical etudes interesting and revisionist. The historical lessons cited in this book are sometime entertaining and sometimes down right insulting to some of us who lived through the history. Thanks for the history book but try telling us something we don't know. Given the title of this book, I was expecting a discussion of the state of our tax situation and some new thinking on ""fair"" taxation to the masses. I just didn't get it! I hope the proceeds from this book yield Ms. Shlaes a tax problem and then maybe we'll get some interesting ideas on how to handle the tax issues faced by US citizens."
1,Hopelessly suburban middle class,"Shales analysis of our tax code is typical of the recent right wing calls for tax revolution. ""The Greedy Hand"" will likely be sucked up by many white middle-class suburbanites who have lost touch with all that they receive back from government. It is ironic that those who most benefit from our tax dollars--the middle class--are those who most complain about their tax dollars being wasted.Shales' proposals are just as typically hopeless. An elimination of progessive taxes sounds fair and just until you realize it means that those who cause most of the unjustice in this world--wealthy American technocrats--will make out like bandits."
1,Questionable author.,"Shlaes is a member of the marxist Council on Foreign Relations. The goal of that organization is a world communist government. Which makes me question, immediately, anything she may have written in this book. I haven't read it. I have read a lot about the CFR. And it's not good. The CFR believes in the progressive tax system. So is Shlaes just naive or creating a smoke screen in order to deceive the public?"
5,A killer song!,The original mix -- which I'm guessing is the same as is on this CD-Single -- is one of the standouts on the excellent Trancemission Vol. #1 compilation.
5,Best Cheng Man Ching book (along with 13 chapters),I have been practicing the Cheng Man-Ching Form for about two and a half years. I have made a point of buying every book with the great man's name on the cover and this book is the one that I pick up and read more often than any other.
5,Great for intermediate students,"A wonderful book by the great master, but don't expect to be able to learn tai chi from any book. Make sure you've learned from a qualified teacher before trying to tackle this book or you might misunderstand some things.StirlingStirling Tai Chi Society"
2,Very clever,"A good trick, but very hard to use, especially for a little kid. You have to tape something to the end of this fishing line and hold down the button with the other hand. When you release the button, the line reels in and ""snatches"" the item away. Works with other things...not just bills."
1,string's too short,"The cord is too short to use the device. If you're standing to use it, by the time it hits the floor the bill will be about two feet from your foot- if you're lucky."
5,the awaome toy,this is the best toy ever!!!!!!!! i had a lot of fun using it. u should buy it to!!!!!!!
3,Very structured,"This whole series is a bit too institutional for my tastes. I prefer to hug and cuddle my daughter just because it's fun rather than because she has ""performed"" for me. I have no doubt that these methods create amazing results for children who have developmental problems, but feel it may be a bit too much, too early for others."
3,Needs better locking screws,"I purchased this, when I needed an adapter for my new Samsung P2370HD and my new ASUS computer. The computer has the DVI-D, while the TV/monitor has a DVI-I video plug.However, this adapter locking screws do not reach the TV's, so it is just hanging on, and comes loose.It works if you have a plug that the treaded posts are beyond the top of the metal frame of the plug."
5,Daniel O'Donnell: My Pictures & Places,Very good quality pictures & script. Arrived on schedule.Made me want to go to Ireland on vacation. (and have Daniel as a tour guide!)
3,If you're really bored....,"This magazine is okay, but not my favorite. Good if you have nothing else to read."
1,Still not received,I have ordered and paid for this magazine yet still have not seen any subscriptions. I am very disappointed as I also order Glamour the same day and have already received two different months. Not sure where Self is going wrong but they need to model their turnaround time for new orders similar to Glamour.
1,Did not order this subscription,"I did not order this magazine, and am not happy that I was subscribed to it and am trying to get my money refunded. I do not know how this happened exactly, I do not even read this magazine. I am not a very happy customer about this and it seems to be pass the ""buck"" time trying to get this issue resolved"
1,"Encourages bullimia, anorexia and low self-esteem!","Just look at the titles on the magazines from the snapshots -- ALL of them concerned with 'losing weight', 'shedding a size', etc. This is an example of our patriarchal-controlled societies' influence on the control of women. I find it sad, and depressing that women actually buy magazines like this that covertly tell them they are worthless unless they are almost invisibly thin and star-like attractive according to some impossible-to-attain standard. Please, please don't buy this magazine and contribute to the perpetuation of this industry!"
1,"ladies steer clear of this rag, they are under the impression women are stupid and insane!","Self is a rag that lives under the standard liberal montra that women are too stupid and insane to be able to operate the same devices that men do. they hate women that think with their brains instead of whats under their skirts. they assume you are stupid and SHOULD be raped instead of perfectly capable of defending yourselves, and are not afraid to take facts and turn them into complete lies. pic a different magazine or they will convince you to get back in the kitchen and give up your opinion!"
1,not pleased at all,"I do not enjoy the automatic renew, I personally think it is a cohersion as people like myself do not have time to check emails soon enough. I am also not happy that I can not access the magazine from my Ipad and I sent an email about it and did not receive an answer. On the top of that, if it is not an automatic renew you will pay less, so not pleased at all."
5,Great magazine!,"I subscribed to this magazine about a year ago, and I love it. I love that it has short articles and several facts/helpful tips. I also enjoy the workouts and personal stories of people who have achieved their weight-loss goals. I love that the magazine features a celebrity, also."
2,Not for 30-Somethings+ (& BAD Cust. Service),"I've subscribed to Self on-and-off for about 15 years, but have recently been feeling like I've outgrown the magazine. The articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers. Fine, but not for me anymore! Also, their subscription department is terrible! My most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues, double issues and late issues -- and a customer service department that can't quite pull themselves together."
2,one big advertisement and full of nothing,"Self what? The entire magazine now pushes product on every inch of every page. Their product placements went from ""convenient and subtle"" to obviously pandering to their revenue sources. Plus the stories and tips are so far out of reality that anyone over 25 with half of a brain couldn't relate. I once enjoyed Self and their monthly self-help plans. Their core message has gotten lost in the sea of product pushing."
2,"reasonably attractive, but content-starved","As another reviewer stated, the content repeats over and over again, making a renewal a waste of money. Yes, Self has nice photography and a pretty layout, but that doesn't make it worth five stars. If you are even remotely into fitness, then Self will merely bore you - it contains such obvious information that it's almost laughable. Still, you might want to try it once, since it's cheap as magazines go, but reading it for true inspiration (other than all the beautiful models in tiny shorts that make you feel guilty) is a waste of your time and money. Reading it for fitness information would be like reading People magazine for political issues. There are better magazines out there, but this'll do if you just want something to leave lying around your house to make a good impression."
3,My thoughts on SELF,"I have subscribed to Self before, and it is a great magazine. The subscriptions are pretty cheap, so it's worth it. Some of the articles tend to be about the same things: losing weight, new beauty tips. they repeat over and over. if you are to buy ONE issue of self, get the October issue because the articles that they have on breast cancer awareness are always really touching."
2,haven't received the magazine yet. I subscribed on October 3rd.,I haven't received the magazine yet. Today is Nov 26th and I subscribed on October 3rd. Almost lose my patience.
1,Disappointed,"When i subscribed to this magazine I was not wanting a monthly dose of politics. I already get enough of that. Articles such as ""I Gave my Embryos to Science"" and ""Abortion is Legal"" should be saved for a different type of magazine. Instead of renewing my subscription, I am going to opt for a different health and fitness magazine next year."
3,Okay,"The real life story it has is a little gruesome, (with pics of woman who lost her breast to dieting, bloody and sewed up nipples.... eek!)I like something more inspiring. There's a few, (very few) fitness stuff and the fashion pics--can't really wear that in public, looks better on the runway."
4,A women's magazine for women who don't like women's magazines,"I subscribe to what could be considered an excessive amount of magazines ( I won't confess the actual number here) but I really dislike womens magazines, and Self is the only one I subscribe to. It is more of fitness magazine than anything else, but also has just enough coverage of beauty, fashion, sex, pop culture and other "" girly"" topics to please this woman. It is not shallow ( like Allure) or embarrassing ( like Cosmo) or focussed just on being a consumer ( like Lucky). This magazine really does cover a lot of topics, has a nice mix of substance and fun, and though it is not aimed at my age group, it is still relevant to this no-longer 20-something."
5,Self Magazine.,Great articles on women's health issues. Very up-to-date and helpful information. Easy to follow workout programs. Great tips on make-up and fashion. I actually read every magazine from cover-to-cover. I really like the low-fat recipes they have. Every edition of this magazine seems to have an exercise program which is very helpful. Most of the exercises are simple and easy to learn. I have tried several of them (i.e. upper body and abs) and have seen results in a just a few weeks. This magazine is exactly what I've been looking for.
2,"It's an ""okay"" magazine",This magazine is definitely geared towards the 20-something young woman. I am 32 years old and recently decided to give Self a try - figured I'd have something light to read even if just during my commute to work and I quickly realized after two issues that I grown past the topics touched upon in this magazine. Mainly geared towards women just starting out in their careers and still single. I think if your a 20-something then try this magazine...I think you'll like it. If your late 20's - 30's..I would suggest trying something else.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This magazine seems to spend more time pushing personal politics and little time on any aspect of a woman's health, fitness, or true development of ""self"". Further, the politiking is poorly done and sensational. Don't waste your money. It is amateur journalism at best."
2,Same every month.,"Not informational, same stuff every month. I had liked Self several years ago and recently bought a year of it because it was only $9.00. By the 3rd issue I realized what a waste of money it is. Most of the tidbits seem to be rumors and not actually valid. I also think you are better off buying one dvd to work out to than a year of this magazine. I feel bad every time it comes because it is a waste of paper."
1,POS,I ordered this item without the information that tells you that it requires a full Ranco suspension system. It DOES NOT SAY THIS in the description. I had to pay to return the item and it has been over a month and still have not got a confirmation on it returned for a refund!
3,There are better books than this!,"I looked at a lot of AP review books, and found that the CliffsAP Biology one was much better. Barron's had review questions that were way too picky, and a substantial amount of the information given in this review manual is not going to be on the test. The questions were way too picky. Most of the book consisted of practice tests, and that was not what I was looking for. CliffsAP Biology had more review and less tests. I actually bought this book and then returned it. I just took this test in May, and I am pretty sure that I got a 5 on it, thanks to Cliffs. Only buy this book if you want practice questions."
1,Not the way to go,"I brought this book and it's terrible. I took the 2001 AP and I am 100% sure I got a 5, even though I didn't get the results yet. I just know bio cold. I could have written a much better book than this (now there's an idea...) The authors talk about topics that are not important at all and do a 7th grade level review of the important topics. I would go with the Cliff's book or Barron's College Review Series in Biology if you want a review book. The best advise I can give is to read the textbook, and DO NOT waste any money on this book. This book is very poorly written."
3,"Good, but there are better ones out there","This book's not too bad..I used it to study for the AP Bio Test along with a careful read of the textbook (we used Campbell's textbook) and a few other textbooks like Purves and Orians.. and I pulled off a 5. However, I didn't think the material was written in a clear manner. I looked at the Cliffs version, too, and I think that one's much better, materialwise. The Barron's seem to be much more better at the hard test question-making."
1,Don't buy this one if you want to review for AP Biology!,"This is NOT a good review book. I teach AP Biology and I can tell you that this book creates confusion. The way in which it was written is disjointed and cumbersome. It goes into WAY too much detail. In a way, the Barron's book reteaches... but doesn't review. I bought this book when I took AP Biology 11 years ago, I hated it it then and when I started teaching AP Biology I bought the new version. IT WAS THE SAME DANG BOOK!!!!!Although biology has changed much in 11 years this book was the same long-winded read! I use it ONLY as a source of practice tests. If you want to read it, go to the library.... don't waste your money."
1,"Preparation, try fright!","I got this book because it looked/seemed to be an excellent resource. BOY WAS I WRONG! This book is unapproachable, unorganized, and unacessable. I am a very good biology student, and the questions posed in this book are far too difficult to answer reasonably and do not represent the test. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!"
1,You Bake 'Em Dog Biscuits (Mega Mini Kits) by Pamela Edge,"Not happy at all. the item is only 2"" X 2"", can't give this as the gift I intended. For the price I never would have paid it had I know it was so incrediably small."
4,nice kit for making homemade dog biscuits!,"When you want to really show your pet your love...make home made dog biscuits! This kit is perfect, just enough recipes and comes with dog shaped biscuit cutters!"
4,Great stocking stuffer,"Wonderful little stocking stuffer. The recipes look easy to make, and the cutters are so cute! No info on the actual recipes yet. . . . ."
1,DEFECTIVE DVDs - AND TERRIBLE SOURCE MATERIAL,"Not only are these transferred from terrible source material (interestingly, with an initial disclaimer stating they were made from the best source material available), but most critically, one cannot SKIP from scene to scene - or even episode to episode!! You are locked in Lousy-Source-Material-Purgatory.Do NOT purchase these. Good Times Video has a real problem on their hands with this poorly thrown together release.When, oh when, will somebody do right by Mr Benny?"
2,Jack Benny,It was okay. I thought it would be stand up but it is skits from his show.real slow but nice to have anyway.
3,Know what your buying before buying,"The seller was a lil deceptive in their posting for the product in that the dates for publication of the book were off making it less valuable than originally thought...however the description of the condition and shape of the book was spot on. Also the seller seems to be a laovely person and offered to buy the book back if I was not completely satisfied. Needless to say I still have the book and I am enjoying it, So in summary upfront a lil dissappointed but her charm and customer service really turned it around plus the book was in excellent condition as promised."
4,Great,"I haven't read a boring book by this author. I don't think he has the ability to write a boring book. This is a ""page-turner."" Also, the guy doesn't make himself out to be some great hunter. He is humble, which makes me able to like the guy."
2,Horrible print quality,"The story is great but the book itself looks to be a scanned version of a photocopy of the original book. There are even underlines and marks from the original owner in it that were not edited out. The quality of the text itself is awful and the pictures are worse. PLEASE find another version other then this one. I am stunned this is even sold in this condition, it feels like a scam not a real publishing."
5,I learned more about tigers from this one book,"This book is a must read. As I have said I learned more about tigers and their ways than I have from any other book. It makes you realise that man and beast can co-exist for 99% of the time, and that it is usually man who starts the argument, and that the tigers in question were only trying to survive like any other animal. Jim Corbett really bings the Indian forests to life and involves the reader from the first hunt to the setting up of his little reserve to film tigers. We the reader sitting in our cosy arm chairs can only imagine what went though his mind as he stalked his prey for weeks on end usually seeing nothing but probably being seen by you know what, and wondering if it would be his turn to have the threads of life cut as so many other unfortunates have had done to them. A simple book with a simple tail but impossible to put down once started."
4,So Great,I was substitute teaching a class in high school and we were to watch this movie. I was so impressed I wrote down the name of it. Basically it's just a touching story and a good reminder that our lives are not so bad afterall. A nice perspective.Con - overpriced!
4,ColdFusion Review Pinal Dave,"Hello,This is nice book for sure. There is a lot of detail given in the book. This book is advance book. This simple, concise guide uses step-by-step, project-based lessons developed in the Macromedia training centers to guide you through all of the program's basic features, both new and old.I will suggest the read the book by Ben Forta : ColdFusion Development Kit (Third Edition) before move to this book.This is good book for sure.Regards,Pinal Dave (Macromedia Certified Advanced ColdFusion MX Developer)"
4,Ash Goes to Carthage,"And won't be writing any blurbs for the Carthage Travel Bureau. Gentle continues to write with that mix of realism, humor, and adventure that made the first volume of this series an excellent mix of alternate history and medieval war epic with a strong, in all senses, lead character. I do not think that the ""today""/""academic discussions"" sections were integrated as well into the book as in the first volume as they lend less of a aura of mystery and instead almost are a second story going on and overall, with some of the mysteries revealed by the goings-on during this second book, more pedestrian. But, the series continues to be a very worthwhile read, for any number of segments of the sf & fantasy universe of readers."
3,Puffy middle of a good book/series,"The first volume offered great combat scenes, a gritty depiction of medieval life, and a pair of weird plotlines. This second book bogs down. The ending is fun, but way too many words are spent to too little effect. Still, it beats most multi-volume fantasies."
1,not the same quality as his Alexander Kent novels,"I have read all his Richard Bolitho books and loved them all. You could smell the sea and the powder as you read. I was hoping for the same with this book, but it was a struggle just to finish it."
4,Excellect Adaptation,"A great works by a great recording artist, you will not find the Alex and the Neil. BUT what you will find is a great, thought-out collection of personal works and feelings that make this album unique in many ways. Look for this sort of influence on up and coming RUSH works!"
4,Geddy's wearing the pants...,"Great songwriting, good singing, decent lyrics...listen to this, Rush's ""Test for Echo"" and ""Counterparts"" back to back and it is obvious who wears the musical pants in Rush."
5,Like a longawaited meeting with an old friend...,"I was first exposed to the majesty of Rush in 1985, when I heard Big Money (Power Windows) on KLOS in LA, and it absolutely blew me away. 15 years later, with my collection of 22 Rush albums still in regular rotation, I can't tell you how great it is to hear Geddy again. My Favorite Headache is a strong strong release, with Geddy exploring different musical elements (techno synths, classical violin) with tight melodies and ambitious lyrics (sound familiar?). Any Rush fan will love this release - It's livlier and more raw than Rush's last few releases (think PRESTO), and the lyrics are far from an embarrassment (read: VICTOR).Great stuff Geddy - look forward to Rush album 23!"
5,I'm glad Geddy didn't Lee-ve this thing alone,"Consider yourself lucky, anything from one of the Rush trio is bound to offer an earful. It seems that ""Headache"" gives the the best of both worlds, the stylings of his relationship with Rush mixed with his own musical sense. ""Headache""'s soul is the perfect compliment to the strength of Alex Lifeson's ""Victor""."
5,I love Geddy Lee,"This is an awsome alblum, if anyone out there likes Rush this is a must have. Geddy's unique vocals and incredible talent at writing music makes this alblum the perfect substitute untill the new Rush alblum comes out."
2,this is why neil writes the lyrics,"stick to singing and the bass, please. canadian humor in the lyrics of songs makes for piss-poor entertainment, aay. Now I know why geddy and alex write the music and leave the lyrics up to neil. both mfh and victor are weak in the lyrical department. This album is basically a rush fan ripoff peice and should be selling in the cheap bin or in the next bmg catalog for shipping in handling costs only($2.75) within a month. Don't get me wrong, I love geddy and alex, but like they say, united we stand, solo we suck. next thing you know neil will be writing novels, oh yeh, he already did that. too late. one positive note: check out [the website]. It is pretty cool. Next time though, please don't leave out the lyric book in the cd. Were you trying to save money or hide your weaknesses, geddy?"
1,Too bad I can't give this -1 stars,"I love Rush. I started liking Rush back in '81. Geddy Lee is an awesome bass player. But this album just stinks. I bought it, hoping for something fresh, but it felt like recycled new Rush (not a good thing) I went so far as to sell the CD at a used CD place and nuke the MP3s from my drive. I really really wanted to like it. But there were no redeeming qualities."
3,Who do we think we are ?,"I'm tired of hearing about what a musician of a famous band must do when the time of a solo project comes. Music is an art, not a science, and in all forms of art freedom of expression is what stands high. I'm not angry, I,m a bit bored of the critics of ""Why if you play complex now you play easy ?"" and things like this ... It's much better to say ""I like it"" or ""I don't like it"". We must be objective with our appreciations, so people can get much useful information about us... ""the critics"".About the album: Don't expect so much RUSH in here. It's somewhat different. It's a personal album with fine songs."
2,A HUGE LET DOWN,"I thought this would be the ""ROCK BASS ALBUM OF THE CENTURY"" instead it was just another bassist who strayed away from the instrument and instead tried to be well accomplished ""everything"".I just wish he would've made it a more bass oriented album----that's what I was looking for. I EVEN PUT DOWN JACK BRUCE'S NEW CD FOR THIS ONE, BOY WAS THAT A HUGE MISTAKE!!!"
5,One of the best albums of 2000!,"I bought it the day it came out, Listened to it, Dismissed it. Put it back in the player two weeks later and it has not left since. This album has just grown on me. There is just such a great balance. Stand out tracks: ""Working At Pefekt"", ""Grace To Grace"", ""The Present Tense"", ""My Favorite Headache"" and ""Window To The World""."
5,"this is a cool, mindbending album that is awesome","from the strange cover and album art to the unrestrained hard riffing alternating with delicate melody, this album is terrific and really showcases Geddy's talent. I hope he puts out more albums; unlike Lifeson, Geddy does a careful job in crafting a cd that is really good. I highly enjoy this album and recommend it to anyone. I truly enjoy all of the songs; this isn't just Rush rehash, it is music that has a mind of its own. Rush is getting much more unpridictable, and I like it. check this out!"
3,Listen to Victor instead,Apart from the Angel's Shared the album is fairly monotonous. It lacks the variety and edge that Victor had. Its not terrible but I had hoped for more.
3,Over the Hill,"I have only listened to this album twice straight-through, but to me, it's like every other rush album since Grace Under Pressure. There are a handful of solid tracks, but listening to the whole thing in it's entirety is painful. Matt Cameron and Ben Mink compliment Geddy in a unique way that separates itself from RUSH, but there chemistry is not enough to make any of this music groundbreaking. I fell in love with Geddy's musicianship as a result of his RUSH work between '74 and '81. RUSH's progressive spirit and ambitious approach brought out the best in all of them, Geddy included. This stature is now a thing of the past. One might say that they have evolved to where they are now, but I'm not sold on that.I think that Neil's lyric's to Losing It may have subconciously spoke for the whole band Geddy included. Keep in mind that what's subpar for Geddy is leagues above most other rock music out there. The disc is a must-have have for RUSH's, Soundgarden's and Ben Mink admirers"
3,"Great musicianship, but not a lot of fun","As a Rush fan of many years I had high expectations for Geddy Lee's first solo album. Well, as far as musianship is concerned, I wasn't disappointed. There isn't a bad note on the album. However, the songs themselves aren't very interesting. My Favorite Headache, Grace To Grace, and Home on the Strange are nice, but the rest of the CD is rather flat. I would give this CD two stars, but I am giving it three because there two of the songs mentioned have memorable melodies, which is something Rush hasn't given it's audience in awhile."
4,One of my favorite headaches.,"Geddy Lee's solo project is a good work of art. Only problem with it is it is not as technical as your 2112 or Hemispheres. On the other hand, if I had another drummer besides Neil, it would definitely be Matt Cameron. It's about time Canada finally met Seattle. ""My Favorite Headache"" has a Primus twist on the verse and spins into a mellow chorus giving the song an equality rarely found in todays modern rock. Overall the tracks are conventional, not shifting in time signatures or anything. Just another great work by another great mind."
3,Solid Solo Debut from Geddy Lee,"_My Favorite Headache_ should definitely please most Rush fans. In addition to sounding similar to mid-90's Rush, _MFH_ also explores some new territory on songs like ""Grace to Grace"" and ""Slipping"". Although a little too similar to my least favorite Rush album, _Test For Echo_, _MFH_ is a solid collection of good songs with one of Geddy Lee's best vocal performance of recent years."
3,"Geddy doin his own thing- good, but certainly no 2112","Geddy Lee's new CD is a welcomed present for Rush fans who have been waiting for a while, but don't expect it to rank up there with Rush albums like 2112 or Moving Pictures. Geddy's bass playing is subdued for the most part, yet the title track, grace to grace, and few other songs are pretty rockin. The majority of the tracks contain some cool real-world lyrics, that come across with strong feeling. But Rush fans will miss Neil Peart's aggressive drumming and Alex Lifeson's spirited guitar. However, Geddy really shows his ability to write lyrics and programs some cool little digital sounds. My favorite headache is not all that great, but it is also not that bad. Geddy Lee is an incredibly talented and accomplished musician. He put this out as a new creative outlet. It's refreshing and different, and grows on you. Don't be disappointed at first, it gets good over time, and for God's sake do not expect the Temples of Syrinx."
2,Wait for the next Rush album,"It is apparent by listening to this album that Geddy Lee is probably the most significant compositional voice in Rush, a band whose music has never sustained itself on songwriting alone. Part of Rush's appeal is the flashy, yet tasteful playing that's integrated into their compositions. Geddy Lee on his own just sounds like Rush without Alex and Neil - i.e.- without balls. And now one can see why Geddy does not write Rush's lyrics (which ain't always the greatest in the first place). Nice title track, though."
1,What is the deal with the hokey packaging?,"I am big Rush fan, among other prog bands, and really want to get this CD. However, I won't buy a CD not packaged in a jewel box. The record companies can stuff it up their you know whats if they are going to sell me something that looks like a used newspaper after a year. I have CDs that are heavily played, and still look like new after 16 years! Anyone know if MFH is available outside the US and Canada in normal packaging, like other albums I have seen?My rating is based on the LP-like packaging. Definitely not the music, since I haven't heard it yet!Judging by the reviews, it looks pretty killer!"
3,Better Than Test For Echo,"Geddy did a nice job with his first solo effort which is long overdue. I think in recent years that Rush has stagnated somewhat, and has become a little too satisfied with themselves and their musical product. Working with some outside musicians seems to do him good. The title cut on this album is way more adventurous than anything Rush has attempted in recent years. ""Home On The Strange"" is also a favorite. Geddy is very strong vocally throughout. I think he's fine as a lyricist,something he didn't necesariily have to prove when you look back at his work on the early Rush albums.If you are a Rush fan don't pass this one up."
3,A soulful experience,"I haven't bought the album yet but I have heard the first single and other singles from this album and know that I will definately buy this album. I am a lover of old soul, I grew up listening to it but was too young to understand just how great the music from that era was. This kid reminds me of David Ruffin and the movie Cooley High. I felt like I was actually in that era after listening to his voice. I love this Kid!!! Going to buy the album now!!"
2,Southern Soul Lite,"On the surface, this debut album by Ricky Fante is a breath of fresh air in an era of synthesized sampled soul, but upon several listens, there's nothing that digs deep enough to be memorable. All the poses are there -- the raspy voice, the Memphis-sounding horns, the call-and response background vocals, but imitation is not necessarily the foundation of a lasting career. Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and Al Green, all of whom are echoed here, are originals and innovators, and had better written songs to work with. I suspect this album will become a crossover staple and Grammy favorite -- it is very easy to digest. But there's really nothing to stir the soul and rock the foundation of the listener. I prefer more spirit and danger in my soul music."
2,very lite&Just aight,"Ricky Fante has some decent range but is at best a Modern era version of Dobie Gray.He is vocally right to do a Cover of ""Drift Away"" but that would give Him away far to soon.alot of Hype but not much depth here. not bad vocally but nothing to get excited just yet.time will tell."
3,Neo-Soul Is Better in 04',"Signed by Virgin Records, Ricky Fante is my breath of fresh air. His voice is soo old-school of Motown which last time I heard was when I was playing my vinyl tracks a couple of days ago of Marvin Gaye and Ron Isley. He is the newest soul of 2004. He is diverse of soul, r&b, and some jazz if you really listen to it. Most often confused with Van Hunt, these two artists are completely not the same. Take a listen to Fante's work~you'll be in his spell."
2,I'm Trying,"This man is adorable. With one sound of his raspy flavor and one glance at his cute face, I felt like I could not dare miss out. I went out of my way to get this cd only having heard ""It Ain't Easy"" which I love. I love it so much it's the only song I bother to play. Maybe with so many other greats like Jill, Van and Anthony I'm not giving Ricky a chance, but there's nothing that stands out on this cd. It borders on pretty damn boring, actually. I want so badly to like this cd because I am a sucker for young artists taking me back to the old flavor, but this is something I was not ready for. It's difficult to describe with words BUT I give this man serious props for staying true to his style and bringing us his music...it's just not for me."
2,"Ricky Fanté, ""Rewind""","Everything appears to be okay coming in. You have Ricky Fanté, a guy who can carry a tune over some throwback old soul record tracks. You have the lovely percussion and horn arrangements as well as some Motown-esque background singers. But something feels very wrong here. There isn't much substance. The lyrics themselves are as clichéd as they come (especially in 'I Let You Go': ""I'm down on my knees/Begging you baaaaaby..."") while Fanté's gritty voice sounds more annoying than nostalagic. Of course artists like D'Angelo, Bilal, Musiq and Donnie take a cue from soul legends like Stevie, Hathaway, and Otis Redding but without much above the surface, Fanté comes off as more of an imitator than a successor to a soul legend. If you're craving for real old-school-sounding soul in today's world of boring R&B, check out something like Al Green's recent album, ""I Can't Stop"", and accept no substitutes."
5,Wildly amusing imagery,"Michael Sowa's book was introduced to me as a must to read after someone saw my own work, and I would say the same to you if you are thinking of buying this book.If you like funny, amuzing and often surreal imagery then you'll love Sowas work. Some of the pictures are quite profound and make you think beyond what you see. They have a dream like quality in many cases. Some pleasant and others ... well... it's hard to describe...... best discover for yourself..."
2,Poor choice for my aquarium,"I was disappointed to find that this ornament was in fact boring. After finally burying the rather large clear plastic base under the gravel the only part to move in the whole thing was the bottle. That would go up, stay up and then eventually come down again. Not the most fun ever.The skull or the other limbs could have been movable making the ornament much more fun.overall; put an ice cube in your aquarium - much more fun!"
3,Only the bottle shakes,"No arm movement, no bubble maker machine, no tubing = 3 stars. Still, it fits perfectly with the theme in my tank."
4,"Very good read, more intellectual rigor perhaps","I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Almost 2 years before the fact, it was pretty predictive of what might happen to the housing bubble. Actually I am thinking about making career moves in the direction of Behavioral Finance/Economics so was happy to see a 'popular"" book in this area. But this is also the problem, I am looking for more scholarly accounts too!"
2,"Great Kindle Sample, don't bother reading the rest","Maybe its just oversimplification, but some of the information here is just plain wrong. For example, in one section he states ""There is speculation (both whispered and in the futures prices) the dollar will eventually weaken..."" Anyone who had an iota of background in currency futures knows that futures prices are solely a function of the current prices and interest rates in the two countries as there is a risk-free arbitrage opportunity if futures prices responded to sentiment. The riff against efficient markets was also very one-sided and not especially helpful. The first 50 pages were great, the rest wasn't worth reading."
2,Mean Markets and Lizard Brains,"The book told me what not to do, but not what to do. Apparently there are no investment opportunities expect ""cash"". Also, I expected to learn techniques to ""win"" against the lizard brains."
1,Pop-economics,"First a confession; I only read the first 170 pages & then scanned the rest. Life's too short to wade through specious reasoning, weak theories and cheap shots at better authors.No useful science or economics here."
5,Works great,The Hansgrohe shower arm mount is a simple holder that mounts to a standard shower pipe. It works well with handheld shower arms like the Raindance E150. You will need also need a hose to complete the assembly--any hose seems to fit the standard connections. I don't recommend the Hansgrohe hoses as they are too expensive given that they are made of plastic.
3,It Works,It works and its made of metal. Shop around. They are a lot of good ones available but make sure they are made of metal. They seem to last the longest.
3,"Quality is ok, sizes are small","Be careful when ordering, the sizes are VERY small and the shirt shrinks a lot on top of that. The small size could only be worn by little kids or someone the size of a 12 year old."
3,Uneven Story But Still Worth A Look,"I have loved the Brontes books so far except for this one. It has some interesting characters and issues,but overall,it's not the first book from them I'd recommend. It does have some very relevant paasages that are quite feminist considering when it was written. I couldn't really sympathize with the main charactor because she had everything handed to her. Therefore(to me anyway), She lacked the empathy of a Jane Eyre or Lucy Snowe,whom really had to overcome life's obstacles,not being either rich or beautiful. Also,the ending seemed like a Jane Austen- ripoff, the overall tone of the book didn't seem to fit in with it.Read the others first before this one,she really was a great writer,this is just not the best example of her work."
3,Good character studies & good setting descriptions .,This book gets a little tiresome at times but over all it makes pretty good reading for it's catagory .
3,It reads like C Bronte's application learning of Rousseu's Emile,"Slow reading and important characters do not start appearing all at the same time but into 1/3 of story or 3/4 of story. Does Caroline have the capacity to understand Shirley, notwithstanding the fact that Caroline feels hurtful. Shyness is a virtue in Japan but I can understand that it may seem like pride and grievance tinged with envy. Ending was exhilerating b/c of movement based on equality and b/c Bronte is forthright in laying out why marriage works sometimes."
4,4 1/2 stars; vivid novel,"An engaging, multi-faceted novel, which wonderfully and realistically depicts women's feelings and thoughts. I was surprised by how much I could relate to! Shirley is especially lovely- thoughtful, brave, a great friend. Yet, I could not help but feel that her object of affection was beneath her. That is the only real flaw of the novel in my opinion."
2,"Just ""OK""","After reading Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights and Tenant of Wildfell Hall, I have to say Shirley is a disappointment. It was long, drawn out and at times very BORING. I really had to work to finish it; the others I breezed through because they were so good. I won't go into a dissertation about the book but it does not stand up to the other Bronte work."
3,Philosphy of Charlotte Bronte,A typical tome of the age except a female wrote it. She wrapped her whole philosophy of life in those times about a story possibly labeled a romance novel now. It seemed as if she wished to be like Shirley-a liberated woman bucking the masculine world. I didn't know Shirley was a masculine name til this book. This was a free book from Amazon for Kindle. Some 500 pages worth. A bargain to say the least.
2,A Good Story Buried in Plodding Narrative,"Tolkein has created a world of hobbits, elves, dwarfs and wizards that's so real you feel you're reading a history book. Unfortunately, I wanted to read the rollicking good tale that Tolkein buried with plodding details of topography, weather, and history instead. The pacing is so off that several chapters are given to a character that has nothing to do with the plot, while a pivotal scene involving Galdalf is told as a puny, bland page or two flashback. Luckily, the movie excavated the story and showed us what this book could have been if Tolkein was as skilled at storytelling as he was at world inventing."
1,HORRENDOUS!,"Tolkien's book is undoubtedly the pinnacle of the fantasy genre.Peter Jackson's films are a masterful and enthralling adaptation.Rob Inlglis's unabridged narration is a worthy and thoroughly enjoyable audio experience.But this 'dramatization' is so horrendously awful that I couldn't even get through the first CD!The Hobbits sound like demented Chipmunks... Merry is voiced by a woman... Frodo is American... the narrator sounds like an Irish DJ... The list of atrocities goes on.I would love to cast this production back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. As it is, I'll just say this: DON'T BUY IT!"
2,Just boring,"I read this book because everybody told me that the movie was excellent, I didn't saw the movie because I like to read the book instead of the movie, but this book was completely disappointing to me, is a hard book to read and all the story (when you can find it) is really boring."
5,"The Fellowship of the Ring ""WOW""",This book is the best book a kid could read it is so interesting that you can't put the book down.The book starts out talking about a character named Frode and Bilbo Baggins and how Bilbo found a magical ring but had no idea of it's dark powers and how it took control of you to get back to it's master. If you want to find out how this series of books start out your gonna have to read it your self
5,great,"Awesome it was exactly what we wanted, ship the product in a timely manner. Look forward to buying more items from seller"
5,"Quick, Simple, and in great condition.","Thank you very much for such a fast ship, along with the item in such great condition. If your are planning on purchasing this book... Plan no more, for this is a very easy decision. I would recommend any of my friends and family members to use amazon. Thanks again."
3,"Ok, but not UNABRIDGED","This was not bad, but not sure how they define unabridged. Lots of stuff missing and a few things changed from the books. I have this collection and the real unabridged collection. I prefer the latter, the author here just does not seem to have all the voices down, and the singing is just odd. But over all, this is not bad, but not 100% worthy of a true Tolkein reader or listner."
4,great read,"this is the first installment of the lord of the rings series. it starts out at bilbo baggins' ""elventy-first"" birthday. it goes on to tell the story of how frodo baggins came to have the ring and what he has to do with it. he leaves the shire with his friends sam, merry, and pippin to deliver the ring to rivendell where it will be safe. they get there and it turns out that they will have to go further than that get rid of the ring. they have to destroy it in the fires of mt. doom where it was created. at rivendell they create the fellowship of the ring, the nine who are to deliver the ring bearer safely to the mountain. their journey ends with one member dead, merry and pippen kidnapped, and sam and frodo on their own. it's a great start to an awesome story."
5,very good- best of breed,"Tolkien was a professor of some sort, and it shows. When I was a lad, we had to read some dreary British novel, in high school, Silas Marner, or something like that. They stretched reading it out to a very boring entire school term. It was torture, and I like to read. I slogged through this book joyfully in high school, on my own time. Why don't they have books like this in high school? There is of course far more detail than there is in the movie. This is a book assembled by a craftsman, a Kahuna- an expert- in Hawaiian terms. One can enjoy the book at a few pages per day. He has great, archetypal characters. This book set the standard. The only complaint I might make, and that is small, is that it is long- many people don't want to read something quite this long- however that is not a problem for me, I like it just as it is. This is a classic. It is even better listening to it read aloud."
3,good v.s bad,"I loved these books from the moment I read them because I believe that they are great fantasy books. I understand that the characters don't have flaws and you can't relate to them, but I think these books are still wonderful. Every fantasy book that I have ever read, which is a lot, I haven't ever really been able to relate to. That is what a fantasy book is about, it's not about emotions most of the time. I agree also that it gets boring at times, but I think most books do that. I found it so amazing that Tolkien had made up his own laguages and put so much effort into this outstanding world of fantasy. I have never read another fantasy book where you can tell how much effort has gone into it. I would not recommend seeing the movies first because you get so much more out of the books than you do the movies. If you see the movie first then you will not understand the books as much."
2,"Puzzling, good at parts not at others.","The book and current film have some similarities, however, when dealing with the book one faces oddities:Where does the epic begin and the children's tale end?One can see Tolkien's style changing as the book goes on.The 'songs' (chants?) are somewhat offputting. I was unsure of what to make of them.As far as the Tom Bombadil character: What is his purpose? Is he symbolizing something or an error in the plot?A long work, yes? The films are visually extraordinary, but I wonder if NOT reading the books puts one at a disadvantage when seeing them (the films).""The Shadow of the Past"" chapter is probably the best in this first book of the trilogy inasmuch as it explains a great deal of background.Personally I prefer the third book ""Return of the King""."
2,setting?,"I had heard about this book that the plot was slow, but it was a good book anyway because the setting and the ""world"" the characters are placed in was so good. Personally, I couldn't see anything special in the setting. It reminded me of the setting in almost every other fantasy book I've ever read. This is not because other authors used Tolkien's ideas, it's simply that it's not a very imaginative world."
5,A Mountain of Creative Joy.,"The trilogy, and Fellowship in particular, helped to shape my childhood. It opened the doors of perception far more than Aldous Huxley or LSD ever could have. Tolkien is a creative master with talent far beyond what I would have thought possible. Do you realize just how much literature has been an organized rip off of The Lord of the Things? Buy for any boy you know--and read it aloud to them if they're too young to discern the words."
5,"Cool book, very geniusly wrote!!!!!","This book was great because of all the action and adventure. It was also neat how Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Boromir, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf had perils all throughtout the book. This was cool because it is almost like in real life when someone is lost in the woods, you almost have the same problems, except for the goblins and trolls. The only bad parts in the book is how they always go to different places. Half of the places are not even on the map that comes with the book. They should have more labeled, so you know where they are going. But the book gives an excellent ending and makes you read the next book in the series, THE TWO TOWERS."
3,"o.k., but not great",this book was ok but not great. the first 50 pages or so is just about the traditions of hobbits. it gets.dull.
5,One ring to rule them all....,"This is the first step in what is undoubtedly the greatest work of fantasy literature of the 20th century, if not of all time. Tolkien has created a world so compelling, and so 'real' that the reader cannot help but be pulled into Middle Earth.The characters are engaging, the story is riveting, and the locations - Good Lord - the locations are Wonderful. Places like Lothlorien, the Old Forest, Weathertop, and of course the Mines of Moria - the ancient, sprawling dwarven kingdom that inspired Gary Gygax to create the Dungeons & Dragons role playing game.If you are new to fantasy, if you don't usually go in for this kind of story, or if you are just looking for a great read, you owe it to yourself to pick this one up and find out what all the fuss is about.Let me put it this way -- there exist in the world dedicated Tolkien Scholars. How many Clancy or Koontz scholars do you think are out there?"
3,Boring,"In despite of my great respect for Mr. Tolkien's personality and the fabulous fantasy universe he has created, I can't give any good credits to this book. It's very leisurely and hard to follow. It's difficult to tell what it really is that's wrong with the book. When I think about it rationally, the story should be extremely interesting. When I start to read it, it just bores me to death. No offense.This book is for dedicated fans only. If you're not familiar with Tolkien, read The Hobbit first."
2,You wouldn't be able to pay me enough to read this book again..,"I love fantasy and I love long books that are continued in a series. That being said... I read all of the books in The Lord of the Rings. The first few pages were okay.. but I quickly grew to realize that while there were some interesting concepts put into play for this book and the others in the trilogy.. however, it was far too long.I read this right before the movies came out thinking that I'd be wowed.. The movies were fantastic.. but I really wish I hadn't forced myself to read the trilogy. It was an unnecessary evil."
4,An enchanting work of literature!,"The Fellowship of the Ring leads the reader on a journey of triumph and defeat. Yet, the reader is rewarded in the end with a feeling of content and satisfaction. The novel begins with a complex telling of the origin of ""hobbits"", the odd, dwarf-like creatures that utilize much of the story's topics. The reader is then introduced to a ring, once in the clutches of the cunning Dark Lord, who wishes to conquer creatures living throughout the land. Yet, in order to do so, he must have in his posession the empowering ring that rules all. The only problem is, this ring is obtained by the hobbit-folk (Bilbo Baggins and his nephew Frodo). And the hobbits are unaware of the danger of the ring. Not only does it make the wearer invisible, but it empowers them."
2,BORING...Doesn't compare to Shannara series,"(...) I've got one word for this book...BORING! Too many songs...I found myself sifting through chapter when Tolkien decides he is going to spend 50 pages on a meal or a night of talking.I read these books following my reading of the Shannara series (Sword, Elfstones, Wishsong) and there is no comparison. Terry Brook's novels are sooo much more exciting and compelling with the perfect amount of character development and scene descriptions. I don't 6 pages of a scene description like TOlkien does. The Hobbit seems like a Childs book to me, since there really isn't much of a evil force. Fellowship just bored the living hell out of me. I put the book down for several weeks at a time since I fell asleep just about every time I read it. (...)"
2,BORING...Doesn't compare to Shannara series,"I know everyone says Tolkien started it all...blah blah balh...Everyone else is a rip off...blah blah blah.But I read Hobbit, then I forced myself to finish Fellowship, then got half way through the next book and gave up.I've got one word for this book...BORING! Too many songs...I found myself sifting through chapter when Tolkien decides he is going to spend 50 pages on a meal or a night of talking.I read these books following my reading of the Shannara series (Sword, Elfstones, Wishsong) and there is no comparison. Terry Brook's novels are sooo much more exciting and compelling with the perfect amount of character development and scene descriptions. I don't 6 pages of a scene description like TOlkien does. The Hobbit seems like a Childs book to me, since there really isn't much of a evil force. Fellowship just bored the living hell out of me. I put the book down for several weeks at a time since I fell asleep just about every time I read it."
1,One man's bread...,"...is another man's poison. Before I get flamed by rabid Tolkien fanatics, let me state that I've attempted to enjoy this book several times over the last 7 years or so. Each time, I've managed to get perhaps 1/3 of the way through before I finally give up. I mean, I enjoyed ""The Hobbit"", and, as devoted fantasy readers, it's our duty to worship L.O.T.R., right? Sorry, but this is one book of flowery prose that zaps me (and many readers, I'm betting) right into slumberland. The characters and situations are well-crafted, but his style of writing about them generates a 0 on the interest meter."
4,Tolkien's Challenge,"I believe that this story is J.R.R. Tolkien's test to himself as a writer. It was to see whether or no he could start from nothing and bulid up a whole new world for his audience to look at. He created lands, peoples, geographical structures, and family histories. It is the perfect fictional world in the eye of J.R.R. Tolkien. In my opinion he succeeded, yet not only did he succeed he shocked his audience. It is a great strory of a journey of faithful friends and their fight against evil that everyone interested in fantasy fiction should read."
2,Self-indulgent fruitiness,"The plot is some sort of Reluctant Everyman Hero Vs. The Easily Recognizable and Conveniently Centralized Ultimate Evil. The author really could have done better here. And what is with all this ""Tom Bombadillo-Hey!"" stuff? Man, that is fruity! The author has a good command of the English language and all, but the use he puts it to is disappointing.This was written a while ago, and it hasn't aged well."
1,Just too boring...,Others here have said it better than I can. I won't waste your time repeating the complaints.
1,The Fellowship of the Ring,"HORRIBLE...... I sure am glad they made a movie of it so I could understand the story line..... I had to listen to each CD about 3 times to follow it. Thank God for the movie because I knew some of the characters but trying to remember the names and places and what was going on and follow and remember who was who.... because after awhile the all sound alike, I thought I had to concentrate to much to enjoy it and I don't like to do that, I like leasure listening or reading..."
1,Moves as slow as cold molasses. Pointless,"The best review I ever read of this book was by one of Tolkien's own circle of friends. After hearing Tolkien read aloud yet another chapter of the Ring trilogy, the visitor exclaimed ""Not another (...) elf!!??"". Tolkien's work is so dense and slow moving you wonder if it is an adventure or a still photograph. He has no concept of moving the narrative ahead. His dialogue is wooden. The Hobbits sound like robots. His poetry is leaden. What is the point of this book? I can't figure out why people praise it so! And why is it that whenever anyone does a take on a mythically powerful ring, they need such absurdly great lengths to do it (hello Richard Wagner). I am utterly puzzled by the enthusiasm this book stirs up in people. To me, it is mindless, poorly written, and an utter bore."
1,not very good,This book is quite boring and goes off on long tangents that have nothing to do with the plot of the whole story. It is like Tolkien started this set without any outline or idea where it was going. The next two books far surpass this one. It was a struggle for me to get through this book. Just because everyone is in love with Tolkien does not make this book good. I know he did not have the format modern writers do for their series but that still does not make this book good. I think that most raters overlook how poor this book is because of who wrote it.
1,Stupid Encylopedia,"O my god i hate thhis book.now, i like the concept of this story and the plot is excellent. elements of fantasy are included wonderfully in this book, but it should have stayed an idea, or have been given to someone else to write.tolkien makes reading tedious and boring and almost make you bag reading it except that you want to see when the good part comes, but right before it happens, the book is over and you have to wait to read another few hundred pages in the two towers. reading this book is like reading an encyclopedia with frequent reference to generations past and ancient kings who you will have no idea about unless you master the appendixes of the third book. it almost seems hopless to fully understand the plot and almost seems like a college course to master and study for instead of an enjoyable and enchanting fantasy. probalby good for older readers, but for me, 14 years, ill just take a fast paced brook's novel."
5,"So far above the rest, it's in a category of its own.","I first read this book when I was 15 years old. I was so reluctant to leave Middle Earth that when I finished the book, I immediately started it again.Thirty years have passed, and I still read The Lord of the Rings at least once a year. This story is so rich and multi-layered that I find something new in it every time. If nothing else, the sheer beauty of Tolkien's use of language makes this story worth reading over and over.Be sure to read all the appendices to find out what happens to Frodo and Sam and all the rest afterwards!"
4,Destroying the Ring of Evil,"The fellowship of the Ring is a good book. It is about a hobbit named Frodo Baggins who was handed down a ring that his Uncle Bilbo Baggins had for a long time. Frodo was told about the mysterious things about the ring. Frodo must destroy the ring and the only place to destroy the ring is Mount Doom which is in the middle of Sauron's kingdom. Thanks to Legolas with his bow and arrow, Arragorn's sword, Gimli's axe, Gandolph's magic, and Sam, Pippin, and Merry's protection so Frodo can succed in destroying the ring. Frodo must travele with them to Mount Doom without running into the dark riders whose seek the ring. Will Frodo make it?"
4,"Amazing, but with its flaws...","I think that Tolkien did an absolutly astounding job in creating middle Earth, and i think that the Hobbit and LotR is a classic. But as with all books, this one did have its flaws. First of all, there were no people of color (african americans), nut this can be forgived because there may be none in Middle Earth (Hmm..?). Second, there were fery few women roles in the trilogy (Arwen, Galidriel, the stewards daughtor, and a few elves). Overall, there were few flaws, and those were crushed by the woner of Tolkiens imaginative world"
5,The best story ever written!,"LotR is the best story ever written. If by some odd coincidince, you have been in bed for the last fifty years and have not read these wonderful books, read them.P.S. LotR live action movies with computer effects are coming out in 2000 and 2001!"
3,"Okay, but the movie was MUCH BETTER!!!","This book had too many descriptions. I saw the movie before I read the book and I have to say the movie is SO much better. I knew all this interesting stuff would happen, I just didn't know it would happen at 100-page intervals and with a non-exciting description! All I can say is that the movie is awesome and don't waste your time reading the books.P.S. I have to admit, the second book is better. However, I believe that is because of Frodo,Sam, and Gollum's scenes in the book. That is its only saving grace."
2,Great story idea but a boring book,"I'm glad I sorted the reviews lowest first because I saw I wasn't the only one who did not enjoy this book. I tried reading it three times, the first two I gave up. Finally while on vacation I finished the book only to be disappointed. The story was way too long and had entire chapters that contributed nothing to the plot. I don't think I can bring myself to read the other two books, instead I'll watch the movies."
2,Boring,This book was boring and hard to understand. I almost couldn't get through it. It got recommended to me by a friend. I decided to not read the second one. The only reason it became popular was because of the movies.
2,mediocre fantasy,"Despite the fact Tolkien has inspired hundreds of great fantasy authors, these books are boring. They detail way too much environment, the characters are stale and the action is warm at best. What more could you ask for to completely avoid a book?I listened to the audiobook and while I realize Inglis is a sub-par reader when it came to many of the characters, the book just isn't engaging. I don't think the tone of voice would've fixed it all that much (but it would've vastly improved the action scenes and tougher characters)"
5,Tom Bombadil,"hey, ive been wondering why was tom bombadil excluded from the movie? One of my friends reminded me of that... who was he again? i barely remember him.. anyway this is an excellent book i really suggest u read it!"
1,The Perfect Cure for Insomnia,"Never before have I encountered a wordier or more boring author than Tolkein. After three weeks of struggling through this book, I finally gave up a quarter of the way into Book II. How this book ever became a beloved classic is beyond me. Now, I have absolutely no desire to see the movie."
4,Getting Started,"J.R.R. Tolkien's first novel of the Lord of the Ring series begins out slowly, but it is well worth the slow begining to come full circle into the adventure. If one is reading this for sear pleasure it blossoms into full fantasy of adventure. A wonderful book all around."
2,Do the next two get better than this?,"After years and years of hearing how Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy is the best fantasy ever written, I finally made it through the first book (after several earlier attempts). I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a snoozer. The book could have at least a hundred pages cut from it simply by eliminating the endless descriptions of nature that the band is travelling through. Another thing that I found annoying was the portrayal of elves - why are they always relegated to living in magical forests, where they possess great wisdom and power, but never use it? Just to say I've read them, I will probably force myself to read the next two volumes. On it's own, however, the first book is a real disappointment."
3,A Classic?,"The ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is one of the praised novels of all time. Lately it has been given even more praise, due to its appearances in the movie theatre. Personally, I thought ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to be no more than a decent read. Tolkien focuses much on character development rather than progression of the plot, which sometimes caused me to put the book down and go clip my toenails, because doing this simple task was more entertaining than reading this book. I have to give Tolkien credit in the level of thought and detail he put into the world of Middle Earth. He gave the reader vivid images of the characters' surrounding (sometimes a little too vivid.) I do have to say that this book is a good tale, but after reading, I wasn't eager to jump into the next novel into the series."
1,The Most Boring Fantasy Book I Have Ever Read,"I personally do not understand why everybody rate this book so highly. After reading the numerous excellent reviews for this book, I grabbed I copy of it and started reading it. I couldn't finish reading it halfway through. It was just too boring! All Frondo and co. did was to run away from Dark Riders, travel through bogs and marshes, sing songs and rhymes, look for Grandaf, etc. Boring...zzz. Hell, the only time when they actually fought with the forces of evil was when they were caught by some underground monster! Blah! I have better things to do that keep on falling asleep with this book. Do not buy or read it or you'll regret it!"
2,lord of inaccuracies,"This book could have been really really good if it had stuck to the movie more. Fist of all it added all that weird stuff in the ""old forest"" and that old senior Bubadil was a little strange. I don't think I would like it very much to be lost in a forest with him and ghosts. Also they cut the lovely and heroic ARWEN out of all the excitement. ALL in all their were to many words and details that bogged everything down(no pun intended). Also, how are we expected to understand elfish.And my wife agreed with me. And I don't think it is just because we are pretty old. My grandchildren also agreed with me and my wife and they are not old."
1,this book is awesome,"This is the absolute worst book ever written. I still can't believe they killed off Frodo, the supposed star of the trilogy, within 175 pages. That's just ridiculous. Also, what's the deal with the zombies??? I re-read that section 3 times and I still didn't get it. Did they eat Gandalf or not? I still don't know. If you're looking for a confusing book filled with wordy descriptions of fish and the walking dead, you're in luck. Otherwise, you'd better find a new book. A great boook."
1,Before you read this book...,George R.R. MartinDavid EddingsRobert JordanTerry BrooksRobin HobbAll the above authors far exceed anything Tolkien has ever written. Please check them out before wasting your time on the Lord of the Rings.Cheers.
5,A Masterful Work,"Twenty years after he publishedThe HobbitJRR Tolkien published The Fellowship of the Ring. It is a story of great adventure, but it is also part of a new mythology that the author developed. In the midst of writing the trilogy that people have enjoyed for fifty years, Tolkien developed two different elven languages. People talk these days about back story in writing. Writers of this time can take lessons Tolkien who was the master of it. He wrote about the past present and future of his Middle Earth, and left it for many generations to enjoy. This is a book you could read ten times and still not get everything out of it."
5,The Fellowship,Another great book. I read this in 6th grade and my teacher was astonished! but what can i say... I love LOTR!!!Boys aren't the only ones who like LOTR!!! Some girls like it too!!!
3,"Sorta Good, but tires me","Okay, I saw the movie first, and then I bought the book. It's nice, but too detailed when you just wanna continue with the plot. Some events are not needed in the book, either."
2,Too much mundane detail makes for a boring read,"Obviously a creative story, but the movie is 10 times better than the book. This book moves very slow and more than half of the entire book is spent on explaining the mundane details of your surroundings. Everytime the characters in the book move from one place to another, the author has to stop the action and spend the next 3 or 4 pages telling you how many branches are on each tree and which types of leaves are on each branch. The other half of the book is filled with these long and grueling elf chants. This book lacks any real action and I wasn't able to read it for more than 15 minutes at a time without being bored to tears."
2,Good Idea- But Way Too Detailed,"I began to read this book thinking that with all the praise I had heard it received it would be great, filled with action and adventure. However, the book is so detailed that it gets boring very fast. The extensive descriptions of the places that are being traveled through become work to read. The 360 something pages (I think) of this book could easily be condensed to a little over 250. Great plot and interesting at times but it ends up boring and tedious to read with all the details."
5,Love Lord of the Rings books and movies,"Lord of the Rings are an awesome trilogy. I have read all the books twice and have seen the first and second movies. The Fellowship of the Ring is the best of the movies I have seen so far. The Return of the King is my favorite book, I am going to watch the movie soon. The Fellowship of the Ring is an AWESOME book."
5,Excellent Read!,"The book captures you in from the first pages all the way to the end. The story develops well and has great references back to the story of the Hobbit, but not so that it takes away from this read if you have not read the story. Very enjoyable and really draws you into the word that has been created! Highly recommend!"
1,Warning: The Two Towers is unavailable,"As of this writing (Mar 2011), only this title, The Fellowship of the Ring, and the third book, The Return of the King, are available on the Kindle. For some reason known only to HarperCollins and God, the second book, The Two Towers, is NOT available for the Kindle.There is also a complete LOTR in Kindle form, but it is not available to U.S. buyers. (Mebbe we insulted Tony Blair or the Queen or something.)This is a sad commentary on the current state of the e-book market, that one of the most popular books (or series of books) is unavailable. What if there were no paper books?"
4,LOTR- fellowship of the ring,"i liked this book however it was kind of difficult to read. there was way too much details and names to remember therefore making this a slow read book. the plot and charactors were described and written magnificantly throughout the book. i have also seen the movie and there are a few parts not in the movie, but that does not really matter. it was a great book, i recomend this book to someone that has a very good reading skill and likes to read, if they dont like to read and dont have a very good reading skill than this will be a difficult book for them."
3,The Fellowship of the Ring,"Choices are always hard to make, that's mostly what ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" is filled with. As Frodo inherits a most valuable danger he must flee with all speed, but everyone happens to be against him. As he and his faithful companions have to go through a peril that could only lead to death if they do not succeed, they discover many foes yet friends along the way, but will they make their transportation of this tiny product successful is the question. If you'd like to discover the hidden secrets and finish the death defying quest then I advise you to chose this book."
4,Lord de los Rings,"I liked this book, even though it was not casual reading for me. I had to read it for school while my progress was being tracked. I hated that, and it took away from my enjoyment of the book, but I'd still recommend it to others."
1,SOOOO BAD-BORING,"this book was so boring and bland, tolkein dwells on the obvius and never loks back there is no excitement, if you want REAL fantasy read TERRY BROOKS THE SWORD OF SHANNARA! END"
1,"If you don't like this one, stop now","I'm not going to tell you not to read _The Lord of the Rings_ just because it bored me stiff; too many people have loved it for you to take my advice instead of theirs. I _am_ going to tell you it doesn't get more interesting as it goes on. If you didn't like Part One, don't waste any more precious time on Part Two."
1,"Well, let me see...","Let me see the flaws in this so-called ""masterpiece"", that I should call THE LORD OF BOREDOM:1) WHy the hell all the characters must have at least two different names (in different languages)?2) The ""songs"" are a joke, boring, it only serves to destroy the narrative;3) endless repetitive descriptions of characters and environment, such as sunset, sunrise, ""the air was heavy and hot"", ""the hobbits were tired and hungry"", ""the fields were green"", ""the sky was foggy"", ... Uau, it's utterly boring!!!4) Heavy narrative. Tolkien should have handled his ideas for someone else to write. He's totally conservative, and you just can't sense the real urgency in the plot, as modern fantasy writers can do.5) Empty characters. The characters are lame and their dialogues worst still.6) Terribly drawn maps."
5,Part of the timeless classics!,"A simply wonderful book! My favorite in the series as each of the friends it now joined together through the Fellowship. A good book for young people to learn moral, ethical and loyalty values. Highly recommended!"
5,What's this Ring Thing?,"I'll tell you. Just read it and take my word for it. You'll need some patience and some time but in the end it will grow on you, like it did me. I've read the trilogy several times, to the point where I can write in the Elvish script (this was handy for passing notes in school) so I am a bit biased. However, it's not the Bible, or the new I Ching. It's just a story; but besides creating an entirely complete world of its own that you can all but touch, it speaks volumes about human will, passion, and the motivation to do the right thing despite how uncomfortable it is. I can't read other fantasy series now because Tolkien is a model that can hardly be improved on. Read it now!"
5,A truly wonderful book,It is one of my favourite books. J.R.R. Tolkein is a master at storytelling and this story is compelling from start to finish. A book that you can never put down.
5,It's a classic of fantasy.,It's good book to start your acquaintance with world of fantasy. It's a classic.
3,The Fellowship of the Ring,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It had a lot of the same charecters and some new ones the main charecter was Frodo. They treavled far to destroy the ring Biblo found in the HOBBIT. To read this book I strongly suggest to read the Hobbit first. This book was very good and carried on well from the HOBBIT, but really dragged on in details. The Hobbit had a lot more action in it but the Fellowship of the Ring is explained better. I still liked the Fellowship of the Ring; it is a good book and is worth reading."
4,Why didn't I read this earlier?,"I'd been a fantasy binge as of late and decided to pick up the first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy since the movie is due out soon. Why did I wait so long to read this? Actually I can remember starting this book at an earlier time but I got bogged down in the detail. This time through the detail didn't stop me and I screamed through it. Tolkien has woven together a very intricate adventure with characters that are both likable and believable(in the sense that they have flaws as well as attributes) in land that you can easily visualize. When I was finished I ran out right away and purchased the second installment and hope to start it shortly. I would recommend this book to anyone....even if you aren't a fantasy fan, because you soon will be. The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is the fact that there were a few sections where the action seemed to slow down, but theses sectoins were short and easy to read through."
2,I wanted to love this but.......,"As a self-professed nerd I wanted tot love this. I read The Hobbitt about 20 years ago and remember really rnjoying it. I expected more of the same here as I finally got around to Lord Of The Rings. What I got however was sadly a little boring, very tedious, and wordy to the point of confusion. Tolkien certainly has created one of the most amazingly thorough fantasy world. However, his writing style is so verbose that by the time he explains whose talking to whom you can't remeber what's being talked about. The actual novel could've been a quarter of the size and probably more enjoyable. I haven't given up on the entrire series but it'll be awhile before I feel the itch to read Two Towers. :("
4,A journey worth taking,"This book was amazing...one of those ""can't put it down"" kinda books. I definitly recommend it to people who need an escape from they're every day life. Tolkien will take you through an adventure that you will become hooked to. After seeing the movie, I definitley thought that the book could not be better. Once again, the theory of ""the book is always better than the movie"" is proven true."
5,Overhype? No way,"I resisted reading this trilogy, felt above fantasy type genre. This is great stuff. There is really little else to say."
3,Tedious,"I found the book to be rather tedious. Some sections seemed to detail numerous characters that I could not keep them straight. I also became rather annoyed with the different 'accents' and 'songs' the narrator used in the recording. Perhaps for somebody that is already familiar with the story, this would be a nice way to go over it again. However, if you don't know it well, prepare to get lost."
4,Lord of The Rings the Fellowship of the Ring,"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the RingThis book is very exciting but can be mildly dull in many moments. The many carnage scenes can be exhilarating and also brutal to read. This book is about a being called a hobbit his name is Frodo Bagins. Frodo inherits a magical ring that was forged two millennia ago, by a dark lord named Saruron. With this ring he could turn armys that were against him into his own, see the future, and turn the good half of his world agaist him aswell. Join Frodo and his brave companions as a legacy unfolds.Four because of the dullness of some parts"
5,The Best of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"The Lord of the Rings/ The Hobbit are one of the best series of books ever written. What is so vast about Tolkien is that he creates a world and a culture like nobody else. He created languages, mythology, huge maps, etc.., culture, and in this world which is as believable as ours, a huge war is on the verge is breaking out. Many will complain that it is boring or pays too much attention to details, but do not listen...Warning: if you get stuck on the chapter ""The Council of Elrond"", know that after that chapter it gets very interesting, and you can skip a few pages if you like. Also, the movie-lovers will proclaim that this is not anywhere as good as the movie. Some will tell you that the book does an injustice to the movie. But do not listen to them. The movies were good, but the books are just as good, if not better.Try THe Lord of the Rings....most likely you will be glad you read it."
2,I want to say this was a great book... but it wasn't,"I have never seen the movie and I only started to read this book after the movie came out. Actually, I was forced by my English teacher. I thought, since the book was good enough to have a movie after it, it probably wouldn't be such a bad book.Well, I started to read the prolouge. Bad idea. My biggest advice is, DO NOT READ THE PROLOUGE!!! It took me days to get through the ten pages of it. This part is so confusing and worthless information that you really don't need to make sense of the book. Anyways, the rest of the book was very slow. If you want a quick read, this book is not for you. The details go on and on and there really is no action what so ever.However, this book wasn't all bad. I got through it, but I could only read about ten pages at a time or i would lose intrest. At the end it is a nice story but I don't know if the pain reading it amounted to the pleasure of finishing it afterwards."
5,Enchanting volume,"I read this way back when I was an undergraduate student at Bradley University. A friend of mine had given me the trilogy. I was an avid Bradley basketball fan and had gone to every home game up to the time that I received the three book set.Well, I got so enchanted that I missed the weekend game and finished all three books in several days. But this volume was the place setter, as we come to know Frodo and his friends and their families, Aragorn, Gandalf, and other key characters.I haven't read this in over four decades, but the enchanting power of this and the other books still resonates. . . ."
5,The Fellowship of the Ring,This book is soo awesome! I have not yet finished reading it but it has a great beginning! Every part is so interesting and it makes me want to read more!
5,exciting !!!!,this book is such a thrilling book it was hard for me to put it down. all the characters are so real but not at the same time !!!! it was also a very well writen book. tolken is such a good author. i encourage you to read the other books also they are wonderful books to.
5,A very nice edition of the Fellowship.,"Pretty enough book, and it has the foreword, and a few pages about the edits and such. The story itself is worthwhile. I'm busy, so I haven't gotten to finish it yet. But every time I get a break, it's a very pleasant escape into the land of Middle-Earth."
3,The copy I got was not the copy shown here,"I decided to buy this specific copy because I have the other 2 movie tie-ins. However, I was extremely disappointed to receive another copy of the because than the one shown here. This is the only thing I dislike. Other than that, I love the Lord of the Rings."
5,The beginning of an odessy,"When I first started this book I thought it to be another boring fantasy adventure book, then Frodo left Hobbiton and from there-on-out I was compleatly hooked. The overall description of this is exciting and overwelming. The songs in this book are very creative, it makes Edgar Allen Poe looked like some fithe grade writing assiment. {SORRY EDGAR}! The thing I like most is the old-language he uses. I mean you don't hear ""hither and thither"" every day. I strongly recommend this for any reader. I was one time caught up in it when Frodo was running away from the Nazegul (Black Riders) that i kinda sorta ingnored my whole assiment for school! (OOPS!)"
4,An Adventure in a Book,"The Fellowship of the rings dosn't really stand out in my mind even though I read the book only recently. I did however relativly enjoy reading it. This is probably because I have never read the rest of the series. The book is based on a long journey of a group of people across various lands throught you get this great sense of an adventure.Looking back on the story as if you were actually their yourself is not very difficult with this book. The problem is that the book leaves you at a very odd place. This seemed strange even though I do know of the rest of the series. This was one of the better stories I have ever heard even though I am only a third of the way through, but I defenitly recomend reading the rest of the series along with it."
5,Fun Fantasy,Cory from Ms. Sullivan's 3rd grade class says: It was about a journey and I like journey books. It was one of those books you never want to stop reading.
3,>>>>,"It was fairly good. Very well written although I feel many parts should have been left out. Slightly suspenceful, but not as good at The Hobbit. It lacks a good hook for the reader and adventure. Lets just say the book has been done before in style and story line."
4,"Long chapters, great book","I am 1 chapter away from finishing this book, I have to say it has been an experience. Most of my friends wouldn't go near this book because it is so complicated, you really have to hold your breath and read. I have to say though, from my view point, I find the chapters long and exhausting. J.R.R. Tolkien has a very overwhelming sense of writing. But so unique it's story becomes classic. It took me months to read this book, and it will probably take me longer to start the second. I reccommend this book 10+"
4,classic,"The first part of the book shows what the Hobbits are. This partis rather too long and maybe boring. You can learn all about theHobbits though. The book becomes really enjoyable from the nextchapter. The story is very thrilling and mythical. Tolkien usesmany motifs of medieval epic, Arthurian romance, Celtic legendand Old English poems. We can entry into the old-fashionedworld of story of adventure.Also Tolkien uses many styles of English- a colloquial expressionbetween the hobbits, a bit Middle- English like dialog by theelves and kings, a daialectal talk by the hobbit Sam and others.Reading this book, you can read all kinds of speeches and evenpoems."
4,a good read,this is a very good read. But the descriptions can get long and parts but otherwise it is a very good read.
5,Good to the bone,I thought it was very nice reading the book and comparing it to the movie. I thought it was a very nice book. I loved on how the author added the poems in the story line it added the interest. I would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in this genre.
1,Tolkien wrote a good story,"But these people do a truly lousy job of telling it. If you can't find a better version of audio book, just buy the bound version and read it instead."
4,"If you're a fan, this is a must have","This really applies to the whole set, but it's great to finally have an unabridged version of the books. Earlier versions are dramatizations, mostly for British radio, (erroneously listed as ""unabridged"") but this is word-for-word. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The 3 books are 44 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations. But it's all worth it in the end."
4,the lord of the rings: the fellowship of the ring,"The fellowship of the ring is the first instalment in J.R.R. Tolkien's THe Lord of the Rings (technically it is the second, it takes place after The Hobbit). I liked the book very much. I very recently have seen the 3 movies.Then I started reading the books.The book had words that I couldn't pronounce. there was stuff like tumbalemorna.Seriously. The book was alittle on the long side so only read it if you wil stick with it.It is boring in the beginning but gets awsome action.You guys should read the book it is a great read!-Alex"
5,Better than Harry Potter,"If you are like me and loved the Harry Potter books, there is little chance you won't go crazy over this book. I was very disappointed I had to wait for the fifth book so to fill my gap I purchased the collection of ""The Lord of the Rings"". It was one of the greatest decisions I ever made. Suddenly this series I bought to ""fill in the gap"" became something better than anything Rowling ever wrote in a book. Tolkien gives a far more vivid world, much more complex, with characters that are far more three dimensional. I can't understand why there is so much buzz around Harry Potter when the ""Lord of the Rings"" is so much a better fantasy story. Then again, it is written above a second grade level."
5,Just stick with it...,"One of the major comments you will hear about this book is that it is a bit slow getting started. But hang in there and get through the set up; its SO worth it! Even the parts of the book characterized as slow are useful; this exposition helps immerse you into Middle Earth, which is one of the more common positive comments you will read about here in the reviews. Reading LOTR is a commitment, treating it like a weekend novel will result in disappointment. But when you are on the edge of your seat as the fog closes in on the hobbits on the Barrow-Downs, or letting the phone ring off the hook, forgotten, as Glorfindel urges his horse to flee with Frodo on its back at the attack of the Ringwraiths at the Ford of Brunien, you will be glad you took the time to do it right. Enjoy!"
5,Great book of the century,"Plain and simple, this is one of the greatest masterpieces of literature on the planet. No author has gone to so much work to creat a practical world, 5+ languages, histories of characters, and many maps for this world.Tolkien provides a thrilling story to read. Although the detail is often boring it is worth reading for the rest of the book is exciting and interesting. It also helps reading the book before the movie, you'll appreciate the movie alot more.Characters are so detailed and lovable (or hateable) that you love to read about them. Again the detail is worth it, it lets you believe you are in this created world and that it does truly exist.All in all, the book is in the top 10 of fantasy books written and should be in the top 50 of books of all time. Read it."
1,So bad!,I had to read this book for a school assinment its like 5oo pages long or something and it is SO boring! My teacher told me I would like it sinse I like the Dragonlance books but the Dragonlance books have cool charactors and cool action and all they do in Tolkins book is talk talk talk! So buy the Dragonlance series if you like GREAT fantasy and not this boring old stuff!
5,need to read,"this is like the masterpiece in history and definetly a need to read, there's no way to never ever read this book. but you should start with the little hobbit, so you'll know the character frodo already and to understand some of the miricales."
4,Not bad at all.,"Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy is one of the best in Fantasy. True, there are a few problems with the plot, and a few indiscrepencies along the way, but it is only with repeated readings that we spot those. You will spot some problems, however, because this is a group of books that will keep you coming back for more. While the Hobbit may not be the best book in town, these may very well be. If you are a fan of fantasy as a whole, than this is a definite must have. Even if you are not, then you should certainly consider this book."
5,an awesome work of fiction,"My favorite movies of all time are the Lord of the Rings trilogy so I thought to myself why not read the book. And i was not disappointed! Middle Earth is not only a world of fantasy and strange creatures, its a world of fantasy and strange creatures with a deep and rich history. That is just plain awesome!!!!!"
2,"It's a Dramatization and the reviews are of something else, caution","Just bought all three parts of the LOTR trilogy on CD. The reviews talked about how it was read by someone and it wasn't different actors or voices, etc. However, it is exactly that different actors reading the parts. It is not a person reading the book to you. I'm going to listen to it and then either sell it or gift it but I am very disappointed. Amazon needs to be careful in lumping together reviews of products that once existed with new ones and with different formats, etc. This is not acceptable."
3,Not a fantasy fan,I am not a fantasy fan but wanted to read this anyways- I didn enjoy it but it was just a bit slow at points. It took sometime getting through it but made me appreciate the movies that much more. Probably wouldn't have gotten through the book if I hadn't watched the movie first.
3,Tolkien--A dead style,"I know I'll probably go to hell for saying this, but I really do not see why Tolkien is so popular. I can not deny that he writes intelligently. His world is undeniably well thought out. However, it seems to me that his style of writing is out of date and if he wrote the Lord of the Rings Trilogy today-- it would flop. His story is bogged down with detail (most of it unnessasary), the plot is typical (yes I know his story is the protoype for modern fantasy writers)and his characters seem very flat as compared to the demand we put on writers today for well rounded characters. I have great respect for Tolkien, but I think some readers love him only because of his reputation and not for his work. His style of writing is now extinct."
2,Not All Classics Are Good,"Get this into your head, all you detail-loving syphilis infected fiends: NOT ALL CLASSICS ARE GOOD. Just because this is a ""timeless classic"", doesn't mean you have to enjoy it. I started this book, and I couldn't stand it. I stopped on about page forty...which, in my version, was about page 10. Way too much detail. This book is lugubrious and boring. I can't stand it; I tried to enjoy it. I even started reading it again a few months ago. But it's just too damn detailed. I can't stand it.Remember: NOT ALL CLASSICS ARE GOOD. I can't believe this was rated with 4.5 stars. NO disrepected to JRR, but...too much detail. This book could have easily been 100 pages long."
5,Wicked cool.,"This book is wicked cool. I coudn't put it down, the characters were very colorful, and the setting is intricately detailed."
3,Didn't work for leaky gut,"I'm not sure why this product didn't work for me. I really like Jarrow and use many of their products. And I know how important NAG is in protecting the gut. When I takeDesigns for Health - GI Revive 225gm Powder [Health and Beauty] I feel a very noticeable difference. But when I take this product as a stand-alone with some of the other ingredients in GI Revive, I notice no difference. I had been taking these individual products to supplement GI Revive, because it's expensive and I use so much of it. Unfortunately, I've had to dump the cheaper supplements and stick with the more expensive, comprehensive product."
4,Nice Rodgers and Hammerstein,"TSOM is a nice score, not R&H's best, but still heads over so much else at the time. Much has been said about Mary Martin's being too old. Apparently R&H didn't think so since they wrote TSOM for her. And audiences loved it! So much so that she won the Tony award that year. (Over Merman in Gypsy. Although, truth be told, Merman was not particularly popular with the theatrical community. From accounts I've read she was a major diva and a total b***h. And since it was her peers who were Tony voters...) Still it's a nice recording of pleasant R & H standards, different in scope than the film soundtrack but pretty good on it's own merit. Enjoyable!"
5,As seen and heard on stage,"This is another of those fine Columbia original cast recordings (lovingly remastered by Sony) that puts you front and centre for a performance of the show.It is true, Mary Martin may have been too old for the free-spirited Maria (she was 47 at the time) but remember too that it was while appearing in SOUND OF MUSIC that she taped the TV version of PETER PAN where she played a 12 year old boy. She had that star quality! Theodore Bikel was a folk singer himself and knew exactly how to sell ""Edelweiss.""The movie is a rare case where a stage show was improved on its transfer to screen, but for listening purposes the story and charcters come alive better on this cast recording. Get both albums... there is much to enjoy either way!"
2,Okay.,"This Recording does not even come close to the original soundtrack, Not that I don't like Mary Martin & Theodore Bikel, but the quality of this CD and of the recording in particular is horrendous, The performers are good, they just didn't do the music justice. If you are a big Rodgers & Hammerstein fan, Like I am, Go for the Original Soundtrack Recording With Julie Andrews."
5,Sound of Music- Mary Martin,I was lucky enough to see Mary Martin in person in a one women show. It was before this musical came outbut she was wonderful. This recording is truly great.Carol Mather
4,rosielyn,"This is the Sound of Music of my childhood. I never saw the show, but the music was all over when I was growing up. I have seen the movie many times, and went on the Sound of Music tour in Salzburg recently. So I got the original soundtrack. The movie is wonderful, but the music from the stage musical is much better. For one thing, they got the singers for their musical ability. No offense to Julie Andrews, a great actor and singer, but the music was written for Mary Martin, and it does show. The stage show did not have the benfit of the scenery of the movie, so the music in the stage show makes up for that. It's more about music, and less an accompaniment to the beautiful scenery around Salzburg. So watch the movie, and listen to this soundtrack"
5,Musical.,"This is the original version of The Sound of Music starring Mary Martin.. She does a wonderful job, I especially like the Lonely Goatherd.A real difference from the Julie Andrews version. With extra songs left out of the film and one changed song. I thrououghly recommend this title."
5,Hills are really alive with the Sound Of Music!,"WOW, This Cd of the Sound of Music is really wonderful in every way!!I was amazed to see such talent in this recording, each character was brought to life by its great cast. Mary Martin as Maria was a very good choice. Her voice was such lovely that I almost cried of joy!If you buy this recording you will be touched by the Sound of Music! Get it today, and let the Sound of Music touch your heart!!"
5,Very Suprised!,"A friend recommended the book to my wife. I bought a copy on Amazon and she read it. She couldn't put it down for 2 days. That peaked my interest so I picked it up and read some of it. Then I read some more, and more and more. I was done in 2 days as well. It's just a fascinating book that opened up my imagination and put me in the time before the flood. A must read for all Bible believing Christians."

3,The Penguin Guide to American Law Schools,"This book contains a very short synopsis of each school, but no real sustance. I did not receive any additional info that I could not have gotten off each school's website. There are other books that are better. For example, the Official Guide to U.S. Law Schools 2001 by Bonnie Gordon(Editor). I already had my schools picked out, so if you have just started looking and are open to any school, then this may be the book that is perfect for you. If you are down to your 8-10 schools, look elsewhere."
4,Good but not great,"This book covers Photoshop from a photographers perspective (as contrasted with an artists perspective). It contains some good sections on color correction, but falls short of being an essential Photoshop book. It is very expensive, contains uninspired examples and has several minor annoyances such as sections on outdated equipment ...poorly cropped/grainy/unnecessary screenshots and somewhat questionable chapter organization and overlap. I think it is a helpful book, but is not in the same class as something like the ""Photoshop WOW!"" series, which is more complete and ultimately more useful."

3,Seemed like a good book but...,"It's true. The book is packed with detailed information. But it's mostly the information that I do not care to know or already know. I guess I shouldn't have bought this book because I primarily wanted to know about color correction. So I read about color correction from this book, and I was surprised yet disappointed when not much info on how to write Curves were included. The methods of using Level to correct a picture are rather simple and for beginners only. The before and after pictures are not that big of a difference compared to other books I read."
4,good variety,keeps the motivation fresh with features that appeal to many different levels of runners. recipes and strength/stretching exercises add variety to your year.
3,Review on Runner's World,"This magazine is very informative on how to prevent injuries, run faster and train for new types of races."
4,Runner's World Mag,Have enjoyed reading more the tips that are offered. This mag seems to fit my needs as a someone trying to stay in shape without injury. I have improved my technique by reading the mag and that is worth the $20.00
5,A World of Knowledge,"Just an all-around great runner's magazine. Who's it for? Anyone who likes to run, from beginner to advanced, casual to professional. Here's a few things you'll find inside:-equipment reviews (i.e. evaluations of the latest shoes)-training techniques (tips from the pros)-info about races (national as well as international)-inspiring stories (to boost your motivation)-nutrition info (tips to lose weight and boost performance)A very well rounded running magazine with great information, I highly recommend it. Also for runners:Treat Your Own Achilles Tendinitisif you have tendinitis that is affecting your running."
5,Excellent magazine,"Being an infrequent runner and trying to get back into shape for the Baltimore marathon this year, Runner's World is indispensible. A number of the articles are encouraging and help me with training, diet, etc. The equipment reviews make me salivate (I wish I could afford one of the Garmin training watches), but in all it's a great magazine. I highly recommend it!"
4,Best running magazine by default,"I have subscribed to RW for about 5 years. I am a Marine and I run lots of miles every week and about one race per month. This magazine offers good nutrition and training advice, and it also provides quality shoe reviews each season. The race guide leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, you can only devote so mnay pages to that subject. (The website has a better and more detailed guide.) The primary problem with RW is that it is very repetitive. My most recent issue had a picture of a female runner on the cover doing abdominal work. I scratched my head and pulled out my issues from last year and found a different girl doing the same thing on the cover of the same month in 2002. In any event, this overall is a good periodical for the money and trounces the competition in the running magazine category."
5,Beginner-friendly...seriously,"I've been buying Runner's World off and on for years and everytime I pick up a copy, I never feel warded off the sport. I'm trying to train for a triathlon and everytime I pick up a magazine relating to triathlons in general, I feel like I'm the laziest ass on the planet. I'm not going to not do one because of this but it doesn't really help motivate a beginner. I love Runner's World because it's all-inclusive, for any level, for any age.I don't get that daunting feeling I get when I pick up a tri mag and I think for anyone who needs that reassurance on a constant basis, RW really helps out."
4,Motivation for the new runner,Runners World contains useful articles on equipment and gear to benefit the new runner. It also includes information that is motivational and should be helpful in keeping us active in the sport.
2,"Um, no magazine","I'm sure this is a great magazine. But after ordering it and waiting 4 months I still don't have it. I have contacted the Amazon magazine service twice now and still don't know where my magazine is, or when it is coming. I was supposed to be coming in mid march (so there is a wait to begin with fyi). I gave this review 2 stars because I'm sure it is a good magazine, but the publisher apparently has problems working with Amazon to get it to my house, so they are not scoring to high in my mind.I am nervous too that my once my subscription gets sent out, in November or something, that the year will expire in March because of their mistake."
3,Still haven't received an issue,"I ordered this magazine just before christmas, it's been a full month and I haven't received an issue."
3,Only one issue's experience,"I bought the issue because I was told there was an article about beginning runners training for their first half marathon. The article was mentioned on the cover. It turned out to be a fluff piece giving reasons why it was better to run a half marathon than a full one for your first long race. I didn't find a lot more depth. Motivational, some general ideas, but I didn't come away with a lot of technical information."
2,delivery could be better,love the magazine but i was disappointed with the delivery initially. i got a two month old magazine for my first delivery. it finally caught up with what was avail in the stores but now I have paid for three magazines that i had already purchased in the store. i guess if you want a magazine you need to buy a subscription and then not buy the ones in the stores for a couple of months to wait for the back delivery.
1,Do Not Subscribe via Company Site,"This looked like a good magazine. I subscribed through the company website on August 6th, 2011. It's been four months and I have yet to receive a single issue despite my credit card being billed 16.99 on that day. I wrote to their customer service twice, and they have not given me any response. They do not even have my details in their database so I could not log in on their website either.Perhaps Amazon's subscription service system works better, but I would steer clear of the Runner World magazine's website."
1,Dissapointed,"My last subscription to Runner's World was in 2005, and I just recently decided to re-subscribe. First, when I ordered the magazine online through Rodale's website, they offer me a free journal, which they send me. No problem. Before they send me the journal, however, I received a package with a training log that I don't remember ordering! This company needs to examine their misleading practices, otherwise they will lose a lot of subscribers, myself included. Also, I find the magazine overloaded with information for beginners, which is okay, but they focus too much on it. They should include articles about pregnancy and running, vegan runners, running and age, running and kids, nutrition, competitions, etc etc."
2,"""Runner's Light""","Once you get past the fact that every single cover features some blond nobody runner in skimpy clothing and a perfectly airbrushed body, you arrive at a magazine that is mediocre at best for runners who are serious about the sport as something other than a fun kind of exercise.For the beginning runner, it has some nice articles about motivation, etiquette, and recipes, a race calendar and shoe guide. But this is not a magazine that pays much attention at all to the elite racing scene or advanced training, which is frustrating. Every edition is a rehashing of the one before it. Running Times, produced by the same company, is a much better bet."
3,Fast food and headline news for the runner,"If you like the ""quick and dirty"" format that is conducive to a busy lifestyle, you'll like this magazine. As a long time runner, I have been a long time subscriber. Many times, I read a headline on the front page only to find a paragraph or two devoted to the advertised subject. A recent example mentioned a faster recovery from long runs. Sounds great. At the age of 49, I'm up for anything that helps with recovering from a 20 miler. The ""article"" was a couple of paragraphs on soaking yourself in an ice bath. It even suggested biting on a towel so you don't wake the neighbors!If you're the type who would rather run by a fast food restaurant than cook dinner, or prefer CNN's Headline News format to their ""regular"" news because you don't want to be bothered with all the extraneous discussions, you'll like Runner's World. Personally, I devour it as soon as it arrives, but I rarely find myself referring back to old issues."
1,Horrible customer service,"While the magazine itself is okay if you are into running, the customer service at Rodale might be the worst I've ever experienced. I tried for months to get a gift subscription for my girlfriend and despite processing payments and taking my money, weeks and weeks went by without her getting a magazine. When I called them the automated service told me my account number was for an account that had been cancelled and promptly hung up on me. Because the account was shown as cancelled it denied me the ability to speak to a real person. So I tried contacting them via email and it is now 4 wks later and I STILL have no magazine and nothing to show...but they certainly took my money. Dealing with them has been a horrible experience and I suggest finding other magazines you enjoy that aren't via Rodale."
2,Waste of money,"This magazine covers nothing that you can't find online. If you like shoe guides, and the same story over and over again just in a different town then by all means go for it. The magazine maybe has one small section that is useful each month, so save your money because they always publish that article online. You don't need this magazine, and it wont teach you anything. Iv'e been a subscriber for over two years now, and it has failed to impress me. I play rugby and i used to run when I was in the military for descent distances, and this magazine covers nothing grand or new. It does have a calendar though if your having trouble finding an event to attend. Overall save your money."
3,not a bargain anymore,Amazon had my exclusive business until they raised their prices. It is now much cheaper to either go to Costco or use a coupon at my local grocery store.
1,"Cruisers Have Not Been ""Improved""","The old cruisers were much better. The new improved ones are not ""improved"" at all. I agree with Ferrety4 in the last review. This Grandma got a sample pack of the ""improved"" Cruisers, it was enough to steer me clear!I want to spend time with my Grandson rather than doing laundry because of some silly purple striped diaper leaking! Take it from a Granny who has 3 sons and 1 Grandson........Purple is not good for males no matter what their age!!!"
2,Reader Alert!,"This book was re-titled HIS BONNIE BRIDE and published again in 2004. Don't buy it twice. In fact, after reading it, I wouldn't recommend you buy it once. Really reads like the work of a beginner in the Historical Romance field, complete with all the worst cliches and a heroine who saves the day and brings peace, happiness and love to her Medieval world. The maturity of the storytelling really doesn't reflect well on later Hannah Howell efforts."
1,distasteful storyline spoils book for me......,"I guess I'm getting too jaded in my Romance reading but I'm sick of the ""hostage falls for her captor"" storyline. I just cannot drum up any positive feelings for a hero who has kidnapped a rival clan's laird's daughter and plans to ""deflower"" her, supposedly willingly though she is his captive, and knowing that he won't marry her and that this will ruin her.We all know where this is heading-the heroine, though her ""power of love"" changes his mind and they live happily ever after. It's still too ""forced"" and coerced to be romantic. I for one would like to see more Medieval heroes written with some sort of honor. Especially nauseating was how the hero tried to seduce the heroine while have to get her nine year old cousin out of her bed, who was trying to protect her.Not recommended-no stars."
2,GOOD TIME PIECE ONLY,"I AM SORRY I ORDERED THIS WATCH. IT IS, BY FAR, THE WORST PURCHASE I HAVE EVER MADE FROM AMAZON....THE ONLY FEATURE THAT WORKS CORRECTLY IS THE TIME MODE AND SOMETIMES THE COMPASS. THE THERMOMETER IS WAY OFF EVEN AFTER YOU REMOVE THE WATCH FROM THE WRIST. IF LEFT ON THE WRIST, FORGET IT. THE WATCH IS VERY HARD TO READ AS THE DISPLAY IS SO DARK. YOU NEED TO TAP ON THE LIGHT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE TIME. I HAD INTENDED TO RETURN IT, HOWEVER I AM 80 YEARS OLD AND A WIDOWER LIVING ALONE AND CANNOT DRIVE TO A POST OFFICE TO SEND IT. SO I AM STUCK WITH IT. YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF BUYING A $20,00 TIMEX AT WALMART THAN THIS WATCH.GRANDPAIRV"
4,Great Outdoor Watch,"My new watch has just arrived. Earlier than I expected. Thanks for the fast delivery from digitalfotoclub.com. I paid $169.90 with free delivery. The watch is a bit difficult to set in the beginning, but once I got use to it by reading the user's guide and just play with it for a while, it's quit easy and I just love it. It almost got everything I need. The only disappointment is that the thermometer only reads down to -10 degree Celsius or 14 degree Fahrenheit. (Which I know before I place the order. I'll be going to some places where the temperature will be well below that...) Compare to other similar watches on the market, the Casio Pathfinder Series are the best, both in qualities and prices. The similar Suunto watches will cost much more than the Casio watches."
4,Great Watch!,This watch is perfect for anyone who likes to be outdoors. For myself being in the Marines and current deployed right now this watch is perfect for what I do. With a built in compass and different time zones it certainly makes my life easier. I recomand this watch to anyone in the Armed Forces or anyone who just like to hick.Casey
1,I Do Not Recommend This Watch.,"My experience with this watch has not been even close to satisfactory. The solar charged battery will not hold a charge long enough for this watch to be of any use. On a number of occasions the watch has indicated full charge and within 5 to 6 hours of being away from direct light the battery will be completely discharged and I have to charge it in direct light and reset all the settings. Although, I have had Casio products in the past that were great I cannot recommend this product."
3,Nice..with the inherent risks of being solar,Works well but needs a certain amount of exposure to sunlight .. which based on where in the world you live (and what you wear) is not as easy as it seems.
5,Cassio watch,The watch was as attractive when we got it as it was in the picture. There was a set of good instructions and the watch is working wonderfully.
5,excellant birthday present,my father likes my casio triple sensor atomic solar watches' so much that i thought i would surprise him with the pag80-1v pathfinder as his first all inclusive watch for his birthday!! i just know he will love it because of all of the features. this will probably be the first of others that he'll want?
5,love it,it took a couple days to fully charge but well worth it. It does all is says it can.comfortable fit and outdoors ready.
5,Nice watch,"I bought the watch thru Amazon and am happy with it, it works as described. The seller was awesome, he or she got it shipped here to Iraq very fast, thanks."
1,"Thought it would be good, but it wasn't.","I bought this watch to replace an aging HighGear watch with the same functions. I liked the fact that it was solar powered as replacing batteries would be unneeded with this watch. The solar power is the only good thing about this watch. First watch had to be returned and replaced due to sensor failure. Second watch would only display north or north east even after multiple attempts to set it according to Casio's instructions. I haven't needed to rely on this watch while out in the field and I would be very hesitant to rely on it as it seems to be plagued with problems. My HighGear watch may be old, but at least it still works. Can't say that about this horrible watch. We will see if Casio will refund my money so I can go buy a Suunto which is what I should have done in the first place."
2,Not worth the money,"I got this as a present for my husband who is highly technologically capable. Unfortunately, even he hasn't been able to figure this watch out very well. In addition, it does not keep accurate temperature or altitude, which was important to my husband as he is a skiier. As expensive as this item is, I would expect it to be easier to operate and more acurate."
3,Great Watch... but not so great Alarm,"Okay, I have this watch and like most people like it a lot. I also have a new G-Shock. Both of these watches have the same problem... The Alarms are Terrible. They are just plain pitiful. I have to put them both up to my ear just to hear them. They are Very Faint. I called Casio and they said that they are set that way and cannot be adjusted. Does anyone else find that the alarms do not work as well as you think they should. If the alarms do not work; I wonder what else is not up to par on these watches??john"
4,Nice,"Watch is big and looks nice on larger wrists. The numbers are big and easy to read, which is nice. The only real problem is that the altimeter works off air pressure, so there is error with some of the readings. The watch can be calibrated very easily, so it is not something to worry about. I have enjoyed using it fot the past four months."
3,Good Watch,"I bought this watch for my boyfriend who's deployed in Iraq. He uses it for everything. The time was a little off because I didn't know if Iraq had daylight savings time or not, but he loves it. He's even bragged to his friends about how nice his new watch is!"
5,This book was incredible! I couldn't put it down!,"This book is an absolute must for all Phantom fans! At times it san be a little hard to fallow due to the writing style that flits from one point of view to another, but it still retains more than enough pure passion and plot to keep you gripping the book until the heartwrenching conclusion. You never know what is gonna happen next, but be sure to read the prequal, Progeny first. I HIGHLY recomend this book to everyone! It's worth it!"
2,Down Once More....,OK I loved her first book but this doesn't even resembel the Phantom to me.I'm not even half way done but I am all ready disapointed.Cathrine acts imature and Charles is a whiney bastard who says *Christ* too many damn times.Erik doesnt even remotly resembel himself.I wonder why she took extra care in changing Christine's and Raoul's name and not Erik's!*Big let down for a sequel.Stick with the first one.*
1,A total disappointment!,"I disliked this book intensely. I loathed the plot, the characters, especially Erik, and believe me, it pains me to say that. This book achieves what even Gaston Leroux's book could not; to portray Erik as a truly evil, self-serving monster. There is a scene toward the end of the book that is so unnecessary and offensive I had to put the book down and later force myself to finish it only because I paid for it with my hard earned money! Read the first book in this series; Progeny, but don't bother with this one. Definately two thumbs down!"
4,Another great phantom book but with a twist (B Grade),"Not as poignant as Meadow's first phantom book, Progeny but the passion and romance is still there. This time, Phantasy is placed in the present but deals with magice, past lives and an undying love that will go through the ages.Eric is still the same, but Christine and Raoul are different people and even Meg, Christine's dancing friend from the original novel shows up. Meadows writes of love that expands through time, along with outer body experiences.Catherine is having strange dreams of the Phantom and has become obsessed with the story and Eric. She feels she is Christine at times and needs her Angel! Is she going insane or is Eric trying to reach to his Christine who is always out of his reach?So much goes on in this book that takes the reader to psychics, seances and even to France and the opera house.Let your mind take you on a journey that will stick with you to the very end.KatiebabsProgeny"
1,You have got to be kidding me!,"All I can say is I can't beleve this POTO ""version"" was even published. ""Please step away from the BUY button"""
1,Ugh!,OK i loved her first book but this was just wrong! Keep in mind i love thing about rencartion but still it's worn! son't buy it please i'm diong you a faver DON'T BUY THIS BOOK TURN THE BACK BOTTON AND ACT LIKE YOU DIDN'T SEE IT. I BEG OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i reluckdently gave this one star but it dosn't desever it.
3,Not Bad,"This is a pretty good album. Has a good production and above average musicianship, but former singer Michael Kiske really left his mark when he was with the group. The singer hear doesn't sound like Kiske, but he gets the job done. I mostly just likes parts from certain songs and not the complete song. ""I Can"" has some great parts in it. ""Hey Lord"" and ""Don't Spit On My Mind"" are also pretty good. ""A Handful of Pain"" is pretty good in parts, but the best song on this collection would have to be ""Laudate Dominum."" That's got some great creativity lyric and music-wise. Would be nice if Michael Kiske were still with Helloween, but all in all a pretty good album."
2,below average Helloween,"a somewhat weak effort from the Helloween boys. equivalent in quality to the Pink Bubbles album. Hit and miss throughout. Best songs are: I Can & Lavdate Dominum. The album is dominated by singer Andy Deris' writing and perhaps that is the problem. Most of the songs sound alike. Definately not as good as Master of the Rings or Time of the Oath, (or the Keepers)."
3,IT SUPRISED ME,"BETTER THAN RAW rally surprised me. It's their best effort since Keeper II. But I still think Andi Deris is not the best choice for the band. But he can write great lyrics and compose great tunes. Unlike Uli Kusch. The songs from Kusch always display that awfully great ammount of double-kick drums, a boring thing if you want my opinion. I noticed the lack of any compositions by guitarrist Roland Grapow (no wonder he left the band after the tour). All in all, this CD is their best with Deris on vocals."
2,The worst Helloween album,"As someone who got into Helloween in 1989, I have followed the band closely and have all their albums. I watched the band grow, change and then return to the power metal style and I have to ask, how many times can a band put out the same album (see AC-DC, Overkill)? There is no growth in songwriting or musicianship here. Absolutely nothing new or interesting. Just a band that should have called it quits after Master of the Rings (although I have to say that Time of the Oath is a decent album). In fact the band hits a new low here with the song Laudate Dominum. Helloween has always been about goofy songs, but this makes ""Heavy Metal Hamsters"" look like a masterpiece. The only songs worth listening to on this album are ""I Can"" and ""Time"". Weike and Markus, please don't spit on my mind by putting out garbage like this."
2,"It could have been a great album, but....","Otherwise good songs on this album are held down by two major flaws, in my humble opinion:First: the always below-standards vocals of Andi Deris. He just does not fit into this band;Second: the bad drumming by Uli Kusch. Technically speaking his drumming in this album is a lesson in virtuosity, really awesome. In terms of arragement and band-objectives, it's a disaster. Talk abou overplaying, talk about Uli Kusch in BETTER TAHN RAW. Amazing! Could no one restrain him just a little bit, so that the drums did not turn the songs into a big mess of a noise ????!!"
2,Beauty for the Fan's Eyes,"Patricia Ford is certainly one of the most beautiful women on this Earth. Her fandom on the internet is huge and her fans will certainly enjoy this video. There is nothing that will offend, but there is some artistic nudity which is done rather tastefully. However Mrs Ford does nothing for herself but strike poses and as such the overall presentation of a supermodel could benefit much from a more mature presentation. Her voice comes across like one of those actors who lost their careers when sound came in and basically that doesn't help either. Her stunning beauty aside, this tape doesn't reach the professional status of any of the Playboy videos and therefor should be seen as for Patricia Ford fans only."
4,ordering from amazon,"buying form amazon is very good and apprciated way of electronic trading but i was trying to buy laptop from amazon and ship it to saudi arabia ,but i got electronic message telling me sorry we can not send to saudi arbia ; moreover , we are having three option for shipment to saudi arabia either by saudi postal or DHL or USPS , so please advicethanks so much"
4,good but far too big in size for women.,"This is a nice watch, it certainly meets all the functions that I needed espcially if you are sailing but before I bought it, it was labelled as women's model which was NOT ! it is far too big for a womens's wrist it fits but looks funny..as I had seen the watch on a mens wrist I thought it would be smaller with same functions unfortunately not so I can only wear it when I'm on the sea but not daily wear.."
2,This watch is TOO BIG,"When people say this watch is big.. they mean REALLY BIG HUGE. Did I mention this watch is a Gigantic Super sized.. MEGLADON? This watch makes my SUV look small. Don't try paddling a kayak with this watch on unless you like making unintentional left hand circles. Additionally, the tidal feature is worthless for the Texas coast."
2,An expensive gadget that needs a training class and is really just a toy,I bought this for a hunting trip thinking it would be useful. Turns out the Compass is only semi accurate. The thermometer doesn't measure the air temperature it measures the temperature of you're wrist. Over a 10 day trip the weather changed from sunny 75 degree days to 6 inches of snow on the ground. The Barometer barely changed. You pretty much have to carry the instruction book around with you if you want to do more than change modes. At least the clock is accurate i guess.
3,Casio Sea Pathfinder Tide Watch,"Race start countdown timer is very functional as it includes a reset time that can be recalled with the press of a button anytime a countdown is in progress. Example: Set initial countdown to 5 min and the reset to 4. If you are a few seconds late to start the 5 min count, instantly advance to a 4 min count as RC raises ""prep"" by pressing reset. Can be set for ""countdown and repeat"" or ""countdown then countup in stopwath mode."" Big dial and characters; easy to read. Very intuitive user interface. Tide prediction mode assumes 2 highs / 2 lows per 24 hours; consequently useless except for USA East Coast. Alarm / countdown beeper volume too low; barely audible. Other functions, especially digital compass and barometer work well. Rotating compass bezel is marked in cardinal points (N, NE, E) rather than numeric degrees. The latter would be more convenient."
2,A Nice Watch Till You Have To Replace The Batteries,"I have owned this watch for several years and have enjoyed it. I agree with the other comments. I want to add that now it is time to replace the batteries. You will need FOUR batteries at five dollars a piece. So the cost is $20 every five years.Then you take off the back and replace the batteries. A simple job unless the entire mechanism pops out. Trying to get it back in and working is impossible and I am handy with tools. A micro spring appeared on my work area. I have no idea where it goes or where it came from. When I finally did get it back together some of the buttons did not work. After many attempts I gave up. Also, once you break the seal by opening the back of the watch it is never quite as waterproof as it originally was.I have been a Casio fan since Casio started making digital watches. I have thrown this one out and plan to buy the solar model so I never have to deal with the problems and costs again."
2,Functions well but buttons fall off!!!???,"Once you figure out how to program long, lat and GMT it works fine. One for the buttons fell off and another cracked. Sad part is I don't wear watch mutch. Crappy Construction kills this watch for me, and should keep you from ordering."
4,Sailors Delight,"I needed a timepiece that was rugged, solar, and had the functions I needed when out on the water. This unit seems to fit the bill. I particularly like the 5 alarms, hourly chime, and auto-backlight feature that can be set to turn on by simply lifting your arm to view the watch. The compass, temp, tide and baro features also provide a nice backup if my on-board navigation equipment fails."
1,Great watch until the band breaks (then $60 to fix it),"I have a similar SPF-60 watch that has the same type of band. It worked great for over 4 years. I wore it everywhere and it was a great watch - I loved it. Then walking down the hall at work the band broke off the band housing. Found out you just cannot put on a new band. Sending it in to Casio they charge $60 to fix. The band on this watch is the same as the SPF-60. If you look closely there is no easy way to take the band off or on. It breaks where the band housing meets the case. Many other stories out there with the same problem that happens anywhere between 1 year and over 4 years. Watch is too expensive to have a design flaw like this. It is possible every couple years you will be spending $60 to fix the band issue. If this is acceptable, this is an awesome watch."
3,Many Features...Annoying Problems,"I received this watch as a Christmas gift over a year ago. I'm still very impressed with the compass and barometer features. Being an amateur astronomer, I'm one of those few that actually use the moon phase feature. But it's not accurate - always a couple days off. The rotating compass ring above the crystal is starting to rotate too easily so I'm worried that it may someday fall off. Also the watch is not super accurate. It seems to gain a few seconds every month. My biggest problem is with the ""mode"" button. It no longer works. I'm working on getting repaired out of warranty."
3,lmag,"The Casio tide watch was not as precise as my husband anticipated it to be. He specifically wanted the watch so he could tell the tides at a glance, not try to calculate what they may be within 2-3 hours."
3,Analytical Sex,"Susan is a very accomplished writer, witha true understanding of her subject.The title says it all."
1,Absolutely Vulgar,"I had to read it for a college literature class, and I was absolutely disgusted. Not only is the language explicit, the image it creates is offensive. I don't know why anyone would bother indulging in something as pointless and vulgar such as this. I have never read or seen anything as sexually charged as this. Whatever happened to purity?"
2,Not that relaxing,"I was disappointed in this CD because I didn't find the music was as soothing as I would have expected from the title. Much of the music tended to be faster beats, loud, and somewhat ""noisy"". The CD is not bad, but it's just not as relaxing as other CD's I've listened to."
3,Not very relaxing,"This CD is ok and Obviously is not Grammy material. For the price it is ok but was looking for something ""more relaxing."" Sorry I cannot be more specific."
1,Badly Mislabeled,There is an album provided to follow along for those of us who are learning about classical music. Unfortunately there are several errors only apparent when you play the CDs on a computer that tells you that what is playing does not match the album & CD label. I paid $17 for this album & am very unhappy with it.
3,Good collection: yes - Performances: so so,"This CD has very good choices of classical music pieces. However the performances are average. The recording is clean but overall does not have the wide dynamics that I'm used to with Deutsche Grammophon. If you have your favorite CD, DVD recordings of these selections already, perhaps you should stick with them.But if you need a good collection in two CDs, then this may be for you."
3,Some songs are relaxing...,"...While others jar you out of rest if you're trying to sleep. Might be good for listening to during the day or casually, but if you need something to use while going to sleep, this may not be the best."
3,OK,"This is an OK outline of the special theory described within its historical (physics) context. As expected with the ""...For Beginners"" series, diagrams are used well. The general theory is not covered. Note: Dollops of the authors' crackpot Marxism are found throughout."
1,a ridiculous book,"This is more of a cartoon than a book. It tries to cover so many topics and fails to help you understand any of them. So many cartoons and wierd illustrations are present. If you want to learn about Einstein, or his theories, look elsewhere."
5,Time is not a constant...what a concept !!,"I first read Einstein for Beginners in 1984 before heading off to college to get a Physics degree. What I loved then about the book was the elegant way it describes Einstein's thought process. 14 years later I rebought the book, and could still remember much of what was in it!! The book gives a wonderful account of how a freethinking (yet brilliant) mind can change the way everyone thinks. Truly inspirational."
4,Whets your appetite for more on Einstein,"An easy and maths free introduction to the world of A.E. However, some of the more silly and irrelevant cartoons might distract the reader.All in all, not a bad introduction to A.E. (In fact a damn good place to start discovering relativity). My grouse is that it does not cover all of A.E.'s works. The treatment of relativity touches the tip of the ice-berg only, so to speak.Still, it really makes you want to read more about A.E.'s works, at least for this reader."
5,"Great prouct, great price.","They're soft, and flexible, and they don't leak. We've tried a few different brands including huggies, and these are the only ones that make it through the night without a leak for our little guy. After 18 months, we've had almost no diaper rash with Pampers.Also, getting them through Amazon means one less bulky item to haul home from the store, and if you choose the free delivery option, you still end up paying less than the best deal you'll see in a grocery store."
4,Great for babies on the move -- sometimes the tabs rip,"I almost exclusively use Huggies for no other reason than I was able to get a bunch of them on sale in many different sizes. My mother had Pampers Cruisers at her house for my 8 month old son and I liked how much they gave at the hip and imagined them being more comfortable for him as he's crawling and climbing and beginning to stand up and down. When I ran out of size 3 Huggies, I ordered these. I like the Cruisers very much, but didn't give them a five as maybe 1 in 20 the tab will rip off and make the diaper useless. It is not the end of the world -- but it is a premature end to that diaper!"
5,excellent!,biggest box! cheapest i found $$ for each diaper. i got free shipping and no tax. would buy again.
2,disappointed about shipping,"The product from Pampers is great. We bought this online to avoidhassles to rush into local stores.However, the shipping is really disappointing. First, I don't think theyeven bother to ring the bell at our gate before leaving a notice. After their secondnotice on Fri., we called them asking about the package and they told uswe could pick up (~10 miles away). On Sat. we called themagain that we wanted them to deliver on Mon instead of picking up ourselves.But nothing happened until Mon. afternoon, we called again and they couldnot locate our request to deliver: there was nothing on their record.Bored of this process we drove there and picked up ourselves.REALLY disappointing. This carrier is not so good as carriers used by amazon before."
3,dissapointed that pampers changed the design,"My son is currently 14 months old. When he was a newborn, we used pampers swaddlers and when he was ready for the size threes, we decided to use pampers cruisers since they had the same absorb away liner in them that we loved. When I recently received another box of cruisers in the mail, I was disappointed to discover that the liner was missing. After calling the company, I found out that unfortunately, pampers has chosen to get rid of the absorb away liner in their cruisers and put out a new line of ""Pampers Cruisers Premium Absorbency"" available at Target. While using the box of the new style of cruisers my son developed the first diaper rash of his life despite frequent changes. These diapers are not as good as they were previously and I really wish that the company would go back to the old style. Needless to say, I am searching for a new diaper."
4,"Good diapers, bad deal.","These diapers really fit my daughter well, and very rarely has she had any leaks. However, you're better off shopping around, as you should be able to find this size diapers cheaper almost anywhere else. $29.99 for a 124 pack is not a good deal."
5,Pampers Cruisers - A Superior Diaper,My husband and I have tried all kinds of diapers and I have to say that in general Pampers have just WORKED for us. I mean I have very little complaint with their diapers (with the exception of their newborn diapers which didn't work with either our skinny son or chubby daughter.)But about the Cruisers. Absolutely first rate absorbency. We used these at night with both children until they turned three and had only one leak in all that time (and I think that was an 'installment' problem dad had--LOL).[At three we switched over to Pamper's Goodnites. It was just easier to get the kid's into them and the waistband is more comfortable.]Five Stars. Best diaper on the market from our experience.
3,No $30 Coupon Code Yet?,"I also ordered for the $30 coupon code. Anyone get it yet? As far as the product goes, I love cruisers much better than anything else. No leaks, even at night. The stars reflect the lateness of the coupon code, the product itself would get 5 stars from me."
2,This 40% price increase is TERRIBLE!,I love these diapers and they were a good deal at $7.49 however the price increased to $10.49 overnight. Now it is much cheaper to buy them at Target or the grocery store.
1,New Pampers Cruisers are horrible!!!,I've used Pampers since my son was born...and I've always liked them better than any other brand. He's now 3 and although we are working on potty training he still needs to wear a diaper at night. I've never had any problems until they changed the design and now he wakes up wet every morning. They leak like crazy!!! I will be looking for another brand ASAP!
1,"Terrible, terrible rash","I have had a terrible experience with Pamper's Cruisers. My daughter is 14 months old and has only had one serious rash (a result of strong antibiotics). I had never used pamper's cruisers until last week. I had a coupon and thought I would give it a try. In less than a week my daughter broke out in the worse rash I had ever seen! There were open blisters and nothing I tried seemed to provide her any relief. My Aunt happened to see a story on the news about the diapers so I switched back to my generic brand (Target diapers are great, by the way) and within 48 hours her rash was almost completely cleared up. I am convinced it was the diapers that caused the reaction."
1,WAY OVER PRICED,I HAVE BOUGHT MANY BOXES OF PAMPERS FOR 42 DOLLARS FROM AMAZON. TO SELL THEM FOR 59 IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON
1,Just realized a change in design was a source of my daughter's rash,"I was using only Pampers brand, first Swaddlers and then Cruisers since my daughter was born in 2008. Several months ago she developed stubborn rash and started leaking. Only after reading reviews today and closely examining a diaper I realized that the design was changed. Now I need to find another diaper brand that will work well, and it's a headache. I don't give a damn if this new design is better for the environment, but I do care about my daughter. I'm very disappointed.An update (04/22/2010): I switched to Huggies Overnites and the rash I was fighting for months is gone!"
1,Disappointed,"I was fan of pampers till i was using swaddlers.As soon as it was time for cruisers,nops.They claim ""try it overnight"".I say it can't stand it even for a a couple of hrs.I can see tits and bits of cotton or whatever it is on my baby."
1,New Cruisers are TERRIBLE,"Like many of the previous posters, I have been using Pampers since my son was born almost two years ago. The new ones are terrible. They leak to the point that my son wakes up because he's soaking wet every night (necessitating a diaper and pajama change, which completely wakes him up, so it takes a good hour or two before he settles down and goes back to sleep). I'm hugely disappointed, have contacted Pampers Customer Service but no response yet. In the meantime, am also searching for a new diaper."
1,Not Good For Sensitive Skin,"These diapers are the most awfulest things I think I ever bought for my baby. I received a lot of the ""swaddler"" size for my baby shower and I tried to use them for about 3 weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth. Stopped using them and lo and behold, diaper rash gone. Fast forward 3 months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied. Figuring that my son was older, maybe they wouldn't do as much harm. Wrong. The rash came back with a vengeance. I had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay. I think it's because they are lightly scented with green dye inside. Definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin!"
2,30 $ coupon not received,I haven't received the 30$ coupon for purchasing pampers diaper for more than 99 $. It has been told May we will receive the coupons. But so far I haven't recived it like other people.
3,Expensive,I decided to give these diapers a try. They are great and my son seems very comfortable in them. However I will stick with Pampers Snug and Dry as I get more for my money with them. The cruisers are too expensive.
2,Very average product,"Wow!! Many of the comments above sound like commercials. For the most part this is a good diaper. Leaks are quite rare and my 10 month old seems very comfortable in it. BUT, we have had about half a dozen diapers leak the silica. 2 of the diapers leaked so badly that we spent nearly an hour cleaning the changing station. Not only that, the silica comes out like a soft gel, and is extremely hard to clean. And of course, our biggest concern has been safety. How safe is that gel if the baby accidentally consumes it? Judging from what i've found online on this problem, Pampers doesn't seem to care.When this diaper works, it's great; when it fails, it fails quite spectacularly!"
4,Cruisers still the best for me,"I used the Cruisers for all my children and found they were the best, even though they cost a little more. The Baby Dry and Huggies did not have enough ""bend"" to them so I found them restrictive. These are much softer and flexible."
3,Pampers Cruisers,"We love Pamper Cruisers. As a mother of twins, we have had to try to find the best diapers. Pampers may be more expensive, but they don't leak. I would rather pay more for a diaper than have to keep buying cclothes becasue they are destroyed."
3,Good Daipers but Amazon is flip-flopping on prices,$7.49 was a good value and I have started to buy most of my diapers here because of that but now with the jacked-up prices I will go elsewere. I would rather support my local economy even if I pay $1 more anyway. E-mail me when the price returns to normal.
5,"Pampers 5 Stars, Amazon 1 Star","These are by far the best diapers available. I especially recommend this diaper for those of us who are a bit lazy in the diaper changing department. These diapers can hold a ton without leaking. As for Amazon's service, diapers were supposed to ""Ship within 24 hrs"". Diapers actually took almost a month to get to me. I had to go to a store to buy several packs to keep from running out. Complaining to Amazon did not help."
5,The only diapers that work with our twins!,"We love Pampers Cruisers! When our twins were born, we tried several brands to find the best value for the money. We quickly learned that Pampers was the only diaper that really worked for us and that buying cheaper imitations wasn't going to save money in the long run. Now we only buy Pampers!It is important to remember that every child's body is different and so different diapers might work better or worse on different bodies."
3,price can be deceiving,"This box is 116 cruisers for $35, but Target's big box has 160 for $42 so make sure you have the exact box you're comparing!"
2,Not so good,"I continue to use Pamper's Cruisers but definitely not happily. That being said I've tried others and they either are too bulky (Huggies) or also soak through. I have a dd that has been out of diapers for over 3 years and back then they were great. Now they soak through. They leak, not from the sides but staight from the middle of the diaper. They can not be worn wet for more than a short time b/c they will soak right through. I recently found a size 5 left over from over 3 years ago and this problem did not occur. I definitely don't remember having this issue. My dd wore them all the time and even through the night, now I have to use Huggies nighttime or the pajamas and crib sheets would all be wet. Very disappointing but I haven't found anything better."
5,LOVE THEM!!,"I love this product. They have been fitting my daughter for almost a full year now. She, her father and I all love them."
5,Most convenient way to get diapers,"With the free shipping, it ends up being cheaper than going to the store to buy the diapers. Plus them come right to my door, so I don't have to worry about going out in this cold anyway. It's really a great deal and they get them out to me so fast, I can't express enough gratitude."
2,Great if your baby only goes #1!!!,"I got some of the old style Pampers diapers without drymax at my shower along with every other brand of diaper. I loved the swaddlers,baby dry and cruisers so I decided to stick with Pampers when I finally needed to buy diapers. I bought the size 3 Cruisers with Drymax and they are actually pretty terrible. There is no leak guard in the rear so i'm thinking that's why every time my little boy goes #2 it comes right out of the back of the diaper! Needless to say i'm very disappointed with the new Cruisers. The only thing good about them is they do hold a lot of pee, which is all my baby does through the night, so i'll keep using them for nighttime only. I've had absolutely no leaks as far as pee goes."
4,good but expensive and still subject to blowouts,"Still haven't found a disposable diaper that keeps the poo from going up the back. We tried the Cruisers because they were on sale. They are better-fitting than the baby dry and seem to be a bit easier to get him into as a result. I'm not sure that they're any more comfortable for him after the first five minutes, though, and if the poo is going to go up the back, this diaper won't contain it any more than any other disposable we've tried. For me, not worth the price premium, but probably the best disposable out there."
1,Horroble Change!!!,I have used Pampers brand since my baby was born and they were great. She is now 17 months and the new change is just horrible. They leak and give her the worst rash. She actually has sores on her bottom! The rash is so bad that it is now speading to her legs. I would be very leary about purchasing these diapers. My daughter does not have sensitive skin and we have not changed anything. The only thing that changed was the makeup of the diaper itself. I must say they not only cause rashes but they are so CHEAP!!! I will never use again unless they change back to the orignal diapers.
4,Expensive but works great,These diapers are really good and works great for my son. The only downfall is that they do not have elastic - switch to Huggies improved fit if your little guy has the runs.
2,Adhesive problems,"I emailed Pampers MONTHS ago and never even received a response. We have been devoted Pampers customers from the beginning (my son is 2 1/2) and I was horrified to see that there was some ""adhesive"" on the baby side of the diaper. It irritated his skin and in that same huge box, several (a dozen or more) diapers had the same problem.I am so disappointed, particularly with no response from their customer service."
2,Cheaper at the grocery,"These are $34.99 at Publix grocery store. Plus, you can use coupons at the store. I didn't find anywhere to use them on Amazon."
3,"Great leakage control, but rough on the hips","I may be moving away from Pampers for my 30 month old daughter. Two other Moms (of girls) in our playgroup agree with me that while Pampers Cruisers offer great leakage control, they often leave red, sore spots on each hip. We can't seem to eleviate this, even with loosening the tabs."
2,Swtiched back to pampers baby dry,"I tried this for my daughter when she started crawling, but it leaves residue (white diaper gel)"
5,price is excellent,"I like this product and the price at 39.99, recently the price has changed for 39.99 to 41.99 which I think is a little expensive."
3,Good not great,"My daughter is 10 months old and we really liked the Pampers brand when she was younger. But since she started crawling and moving around, we prefer the Huggies brand. The huggies diapers wrap around the thigh and create a nice seal. Twice, my daughter has had accidents with the cruisers where it leaked. I think this is due to the fact that the shape of the pampers create openings when she moves around. These diapers are also more expensive than the Huggies brand."
3,"fun, engaging, sesame street characters?????","the Pampers are just fine. no real complaints as they do they're job well and most times will accomodate the largest deposits by your little one.the only issue i have is with the sesame street characters Pampers puts on them.1. how much would consumers save by not having to cover the licensing costs2. the little ones don't give a hoot about the characters and if they do spend a lot of time staring at thier wastebands, you should have them examined by a professional"
1,We're looking for a new diaper,Don't look at the old reviews of these diapers. Just look at the ones from the past few months and you'll see what the new trend is. I would ignore any 5 star reviews as they probably work for Pampers. There's not a conspiracy against Pampers...Pampers changed their diapers. They had great reviews until they changed them.
2,Terrible New Price from Amazon...,"Love the diapers...used to pay $7.49...with 2 kids in diapers...forget $70/month at amazon. At $10.49 a pack, my money goes back to Costco."
4,Better than Baby Dry!,"I used to love Huggies Supreme diapers- until they switched them to this GentleCare or NaturalFit with HugFlex... and honestly they are terrible. The plain ""old"" Supreme diapers were the best, and now I can't even get them at any store in town anymore. SO I switched to Pampers Baby Dry, which are about 20 cents per pack cheaper than Pampers Cruisers. Those were the most terrible diapers I have EVER tried. Nearing desperation level, I tried Cruisers, and I'm glad I did. They are almost as good as the old Huggies Supreme diapers. I love that I can get them with free shipping from Amazon - plus if you enter in the codes on the inside of the packs you can get free stuff from the Pampers website. Not bad!"
5,Best diapers for girls !!!,It's just best brand which I tried!It is not leaking!My daughter likes it too because it's soft and easy!
3,New Pampers Cruisers w/ New Problem!,"The new pampers cruisers use new inside soft net like liner which first I thought would be great but they're not at all! They leave quite a lot of white lint on my son's bottom. I'm not alone in this case, a friend of mine has exactly the same problem for her daughter! Caution should be taken if you have a baby girl because the lint might get inside her private area. I really liked the old cruisers and I want them back!"
3,"Great product, not so great company","I love the Pampers diapers and had been buying them from another site diapers dot com, until I saw that Baby Age had them for a lot less here on Amazon. Being a mom of 10 month old twins, and someone who buys no less than three large boxes every month, I was very excited. Until I used the 'one click' buying and got hit with Baby Age's $10 per item shipping fee. An extra $30 just to have diapers shipped when on the other site I get the same thing for free? No thanks. I won't be buying from Baby Age again.So, the are great diapers and I haven't had a single leak, but I won't buy from Baby Age again. I'll be heading back to diapers dot com."
3,"Bend well, but don't hold much.","I tried the cruisers on sale when the Pampers Baby Dry were the same $ amount. I was unhappy with the results. It leaked more often than not. I couldn't put him to bed in them. He had several ""blow-outs"" with them. I won't use them ever again. I'll stick with the pampers baby dry or seventh generation."
5,Pleased with Pampers Cruisers,"Our baby is a Pampers baby. Only problem I have noted is that Pampers diapers don't always hold up well for overnight especially if you child will sleep 10 hours straight. Otherwise, my husband and I are quite happy using Pampers."
5,ksintrak,"We have tried other products before, but we still like Pampers cruisers the most. The supper dry Pampers are not good for my daughter because of the cremical in it."
3,missing the old pampers,"what happened?? pampers cruisers changed their long time staple diapers, and definitely NOT for the better. my son is getting diaper rash for the first time EVER, and they just aren't as absorbent."
3,Why pay more at the same site?,"I love these diapers and always buy them from Amazon when they are $7.49. I don't understand why Amazon would charge more per diaper for the ""Value Pack"" than for the regular pack.For a size 4 cruiser sold in the regular 32 count package, one will pay $.234, but in the VALUE pack one will pay $.288. This just doesn't make sense to me."
1,It's the Dry Max inside the old box.,My daughter had serious diaper rash when wearing these diapers. I thought I have gotten the old version. Then it turns out the new Dry Max in the old box. What a sneaky way to cheat the customers! Don't they think we can tell?!
2,not good enough,"These diapers are supposed to be for moving babies and in that respect they are pretty good. However, they do not withstand much liquid in them before they start filtering through."
5,Great product,"These are by far the best diapers we have used on our son. With all other brands his cloths end up wet in the morning, but not theses. Buy them."
1,"Cut WAY too small, they barely stretch!","After my 1yo constantly getting red marks on her hips, we switched to Huggies! Not even Pampers cruisers have enough stretch to them to accomodate for chubby thighs :) I guess if you have a petite one, you'll love these, but for those who have chubby bubs like me, you won't be so happy with these!"
4,Easy and secure!,These diapers are very good at holding in the liquids and keeping the baby dry. I like them for everything except night time. Our son overloads them at night.
5,These diapers really do dipe!,"There's not much more to say except that these diapers really do their job: they absorb number 1, number 2, and even number 3 when necessary. They do the job without complaint, and with disregard for the producer of the respective number. We keep these around our house for when the children do a number - the fact that they coem in cases means we run out of the less frequently. Dipe, and dipe well!!!"
4,Not such a great deal since they raised the price,"I feel like a fool because I told all of the moms I know to get their diapers from Amazon because it was such a great deal. Then I found out they had raised the price three whole dollars between the time I bought diapers and the time my friends went to buy them. Now I look like I don't know what I am talking about.On the other hand, I really like the product. I will warn you that the sizes seem to be a bit off to me. I've been using size 3 since my daughter was about 13 pounds. The size 2s were much too small by that point. So count on them running a little small."
2,amazon box contains less than what you can get elsewhere,"Pay careful attention to the number of diappers included in this value box! It is smaller than the normal box you usually get from other stores or from amazon, thus the price is not really cheap.I purchased the No 3 Cruisers value box from amazon twice, one box came with 160 diapers, and one came with 116 diapers"
1,Leak and make my kid cry,"Today is the 2nd day we have been using this diaper but we already washed the crib sheet twice. It leaks a lot! What makes it worse is it irritates my kid's skin. Everytime after I put it on, she starts to scream and cry. We just ordered 2 boxes from Amazon. Now we have to go buy some other diapers."
5,We only use Pampers,"We've tried a lot of different diapers, and the type that fits our children best are the Pampers. We have never had a Pampers leak, except for one time when we changed a diaper really sleep deprived and put it on inside out. I do not recommend putting on a diaper inside out."
4,Thought I'd change and I think I'll go back...,Not as good as Pampers Baby Dry. They are harder to get on if that ispossible. Toddlers wiggle and the tabs don't come out as fast.Still like them though
4,"Good, not great","Was using huggies prior, and wanted to change because huggies was leaving white crystal/sand on our daughters bottom, plus it didnt fit all that well, but it was fine. Tried the pampers, because we used it for overnight use since it seemed to hold it better, in any case, now using it for everyday, all day, not so much the crystal residue left behind, but is leaving something behind just not as bad. Seems to fit better, i dont think our daughter cares one way of the other. If you like it use it, otherwise, nothing special"
3,So so...,"I used other pampers but I had ""Cruisers"" for the first time. Pampers is kind of light but shallow than hugghies. compared to the price it wasn't bad."
5,Great diapers,"We love these diapers for my 2 year old and one year old sons. One is thin, the other, pretty stout and we never have leaks for either child. I've tried 3 other brands and none compare."
1,Price Increased by THREE DOLLARS,I have been buying diapers on Amazon for several months and all of a sudden in the last couple weeks they increased the price by THREE DOLLARS! No longer is this the best solution to buy diapers. Go to Target -- They are cheaper there and take the pampers $1 off coupon that is in the paper almost weekly. BOOO on AMAZON for a ridiculous price increase. The grocery store even has a better price than this! The Diapers are the best out there.
5,Great Diapers!!,"I love these diapers for my son, they give him a lot of movement and no Leaking which is always a great plus! I wouldn't use anything else!"
2,"2 star for sometimes fast but unreliable delivery, 5 stars for product","Great product, ok price, but the delivery is unreliable. We had some fast deliveries before, but it's getting worse lately. Our last order has not been shipped after more than two weeks, and the estimated shipping date is in another week. If you need the diapers within a month, think about buying them somewhere else."
3,Pampers Cruisers,"This is a good size box for our usage. Living in the city we do not have much storage space, so these keep me from running out of diapers every week, but at the same time don't take up too much space. The diapers in the last couple of orders have been leaving lint on my baby, but this set seems better."
4,Good diapers but can't tell much difference comparing to Baby Dry.,Good diapers but can't tell much difference comparing to Baby Dry.
1,PRICE INCREASE BY THREE DOLLARS,I have been buying diapers on Amazon for several months and all of a sudden in the last couple weeks they increased the price by THREE DOLLARS! No longer is this the best solution to buy diapers. Go to Target -- They are cheaper there and take the pampers $1 off coupon that is in the paper almost weekly. BOOO on AMAZON for a ridiculous price increase. The grocery store even has a better price than this!
4,never a leak,"i have ordered pampers on amazon since my daughter was very small and have never had a problem. this package looks a bit different, i dont know if pampers just changed the diaper or what. have yet to test them out but they do smell the same...haha."
5,best diapers,"Best diapers ever! I received it in time. Too band they raised the price , I'll think about buying it here again."
2,I`ts not cheap but really wery low quolity,"Internal surface greed, for keep cotton absorber on place, do not hold cotton fibers propertly, a lot of it sleep on my doghter skin after usage of this dipers. Can be used with limitation. Absorbtion abilities is outstanding."
1,no bargins here,the cost of these diapers are way more than you would pay at any local retailer or national chain...then to use a coupon on top of that...wow what a difference. Save your money and shipping costs and go to Target. Do price per diaper comparisons and you would be surprised how much diapers cost and how to save money!!
3,Keeps her dry enough.,"But it is cut so small that the size 1 barely fits my daughter who is 11 pounds. I have trouble fastening the straps, and I am considering switching to Huggies. If you insist on Pampers, buy the Swaddlers, not the Cruisers."
