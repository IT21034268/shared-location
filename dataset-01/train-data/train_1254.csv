5,Couldn't be better,"This is definitely the best way to learn Arabic in the classroom. As the next book in the series (the first being ""Ahlan wa Sahlan""), it definitely complements the train of learning in this particular Semitic language. Highly recommend if you are an intermediate Arabic learner (if you have had at least a full year of study) and especially if your elementary Arabic was taught to you by the book ""Ahlan wa Sahlan."" Also, if you ever get the chance in your life to meet the extraordinary professor, Dr. Mahdi Alosh, I highly recommend it as well. Enjoy."
4,Definitely works,"I bought this for my hubby as a Christmas gift because he is the french fry maker in our house.....for some reason I thought the fries would be thick cut fries, but they are more like McDonald fries (long and thin). So if you are looking for Micky D fries, this is your blade. If you want them a little thicker, then I don't think this is what you are looking for."
4,Not made for sweet potatoes.,"We've been eating more sweet potatoes and yams as healthy alternative to white potatoes. Usually I slice them and drizzle with olive oil and bake, so I thought slicing them as fries would be more appealing to kids (and less expensive than the frozen ones at the health food co-op). I used this disc in my Cuisinart Prep 11 plus. It turns out that yams and sweet potatoes are alot more firm than white potatoes. The light gold colored ones sliced up a little better than the dark red ones, but both colors were a bit of a hassle, getting stuck in the blade and jamming it up.Works great on white potatoes though, and I'm looking forward to using it on other vegetables for stir fries and salads."
5,Awesome!,"The disk makes really cute slightly curved (due to blade rotation) french fries. Good quality, easy to use product."
4,Shoestring Fries,This disk produces shoestring fries. If you want something larger you'll need to look elsewhere for your preparation tool. To date I have used it only to prepare sweet potato fries but I plan to try using this disk to cut chicken when preparing a meal like fajitas.
3,Ok product,I was hoping to be able to cut fries a little bigger with this blade but I undertand food processors have their limits. It is a good product. Sweet potatoes get stuck in the blade easily so you must clear blade a lot.
3,Sweet Potatoes get stuck,"I LOVE sweet potato fries and so does my toddler, so I was excited to put this disk to use. Unfortunately the sweet potato gets jammed. But it is worth it since it keeps me from losing a finger from slicing by hand!"
3,nice for the purpose i bought it,"i used it to slice my vegetable UPO, it does its' purpose. I have not use it for fries just for vegetalbe UPO s aquash family"
3,Too small!,I like the rest of the comments left feel this really isn't a GREAT french fry maker. Yes if you lay your potatoes sideways you do get McDonald size fries. BUT WISHED Cuisinart would MAKE a larger disc like Ware food processors have.
3,"Well-intentioned, occasionally useful, but...","You really have to approach this book with your baloney detectors on 'High.' There's a lot of excellent, insightful analysis on what's going on with the change 'jerk' (where 'jerk' is defined as the rate of change of the rate of change -- the acceleration of acceleration) of recent years, where changes in technology drive societal changes at an expanding pace. There's also a whole lot of unfocused hogwash and one-true-wayism; these kids take themselves quite seriously, in that bedrock way that people who think they *don't* take themselves too seriously sometimes do. You can sift through the bullpuckey to find a good haul of useful nuggetry, but if you swallow this book whole, you'll find that the sharp corners don't go down so easy."
2,Baloney warning,"I couldn't agree more with the reviewer from ""Sodom-on-the-Bay."" Beware authors whose self-esteem rests so strongly on their image as iconoclasts. Beware them particularly when they resort to ""paradox"" as an explanation for any line of reasoning that leaves them painted into a corner. On the other hand, these guys are trying to take a fresh look at business and marketing conundrums, and their stories often yield interesting insights which, unfortunately, they're not so great at articulating or generalizing from. Instead, they opt for sounding ""deep"" by claiming that the stories defy traditional analysis. A useful rule of thumb might be to skim any paragraph that deals in abstracts (high balderdash quotient there) and pay more attention to the anecdotes."
5,Changed everything,"I read this book when it was first published. It changed my view on everything that was going then and was a catalyst for creating a totally different life that I am so much happier with now. I ran across this book the other day while looking for my cat, I sat down to read for a while and still find many relevant and comfy thoughts. I still use matras I learned from the 500 year deltra today and they serves me well in my everyday professional life. This is a good book to read if you need to change your prespective, life or need courage in your decision making."
4,Excerpted in Wired magazine,"Originally, I became interested in this book by reading an excerpt printed in Wired magazine. Wired only printed the glossary of the book but that was enough to pique my interest. In general, I think that is how the book should be approached. It is thought-provoking and interesting but should not be taken too seriously. It is certainly enjoyable, especially if you enjoy Wired."
2,Baloney,The only thing I can say after reading this book is--baloney! I've never read a more useless business book such as this. I have no doubt that the author has never worked a day in his life. Get a job! Get a life!
3,Unfortunately the style has changed,"I love ""Près de Toi"" and ""Tendrement""; they're great albums packed full of catchy, fun pop songs. I listen to them almost every day! In contrast, her new album is a disappointment. The songs are accompanied by un-catchy, over-loud accompaniments. Or just dull ballads. The only tracks that are fun are ""Ensorcellée"" and ""Bandana et Poésie""; these tunes are more of the classic Lorie style- `prince charmant' makes his third appearance! I hope that Lorie's next album will be more like the previous two."
5,Better than Pres de Toi,This CD was better than her last CD (Pres de Toi). I think she learned to use her voice better. She still has the same style but with better beats. And she can sing very well.Her songs sound like Hilary Duff but with good beats and better vocals.If you are looking for a French pop singer this CD is for you.P.S.She is prettier than than the American singers.
1,oh,"I would give her zero stars!You call this music?Give Mylene Faermer a try, or Emilie Simon, or even Zazie. Not LORIE. Eww. Weekend is the worst song I ever heard."
3,A good book for parents dealing with gay children.,Easy to read. Not too long. Good for parents who are struggling with a gay child.
5,Poignant Commentary of South on eve of the Civil War,"Target Margin Theater in New York City just staged a production of South (1/97). The play is a penetrating commentary on the tensions on the Southern plantation on the eve of the Civil War. Set on a plantation an hour outside of Charleston, South Carolina on the night before the Federal forces reprovisioned Fort Sumter and the Confederate forces under General Beauregarde fired the first shots of the civil war. In this drama, field and house slaves, plantation owners, abolitionists, foreigners, catholics, lutherans, and young boys and girls grapple with the issues of love, honor, loyalty, decency and (as a subject male love). The writing is sharp and quick, even if some of the attitudes are somewhat dated"
5,Good ol' Liquid Mind,"This is much like the first album from Liquid Mind, 3 long pieces of ambience. I believe future albums have more songs that aren't as lengthy. I actually like the long song format, since there aren't many breaks between songs. Other than that... this is Liquid Mind. It helps me at work and at home."
5,Great for Massage,"I have many many CD's which I play while I do massage. I have never had so many people comment on a particular CD as I have this one. It's very calming, and seems to put people more deeply into a relaxed state. There is far less talking by my more talkative clients when this CD plays."
1,Bradycardia,"A follow up to Liquid Mind #1; Ambience Minimus (which is a wonderful CD). Slow World follows the same tonal layered formula of #1, but is benign and energyless. It's linear evolution is similar, but it's field of space is shallow. Leaving the listener bored. I agree with ""spotlight reviewer"" Mr. King. It will put you to sleep. But thats not what good ambient music is intended for. The intent of a good slow book is not to put you to sleep, but rather to give you something to dwell upon. Ambient music also gives you a field allowing your consciousness to wander."
5,Wow!!,Such a great album! My clients and I both enjoy listening to this music. It is another Liquid Mind great!
5,Slow World by Liquid Mind,The music is awesome. I have used it in many meditations as a prelude to total relaxation. I would highly recommend the product.
1,early immature work,"Big fan of Liquid Mind. In comparison to his later works, like Balance and Unity, this cd is not so good. The composer is finding his style which matures in leaps and bounds in his later cd's. In fact, a quantum leap. ""Slow World"" is a worthy first effort of an artist who is finding his way. I wouldn't recommend this cd at all unless you're a rabid fan. However, I recommend ""Balance"" and ""Unity"" very enthusiastically."
2,MPB Lady of Annihilation,"Not that great of a CD. I thought it would be pretty decent, as most trustkill bands are, but I wasnt a big fan. It was really cheap and in fact I only paid a penny for the disc plus shipping, which is why i went ahead and bought it. the end of the CD is a long session of the band members talking about random stupid things."
4,This is a killer album...down here with me,"WOW...so what else is there to say...MPB owns me, this is pummeling hardcore the way it should be, with a slight old school edge...BUY THIS, RIGHT NOW or face certain regret."
1,bored,I was in a local Chicago hardcore band back in the mid eighties. Bands that sounded just like this were a dime a dozen way back then. Enough already.
1,Potential nerve damage,Years ago there were albums of music to break your lease by. This one outdoes them all. It consists of the most godawful din masquerqding as music. I think I'll wait for their acoustic album.
2,I wanted to like this cd but....,"As stated above this is another cd that was recommended by some friends who said that it was awesome. I decided to go out and get it and when I went to listen to it. I really did want to like it and I hoped that it would be good but ultimately I was disappointed. For one thing, I cannot get past the singer who just seems awful. I like my vocals heavy for the most part so his singing style seemed terrible. Also I liked a song here or there but overall I didn't like that many of them. I thought it was interesting that they included some ""funny"" bonus tracks at the end, but overall it didn't add to much to this dull release. I hope that for their next cd they get a new singer and maybe then they will improve from there."
1,"Yummy, but dont break your tooth","I recently bought scharffen berger chocolate from the store near my house. It tasted yummy. However when I was sampling it, I almost broke my tooth. There was a metal button in with the chocolate. It was hard to get hold of them to tell them of my problem. If you find something they want to get it away from you fast and give you a small amount of money. I didnt like how they handled it. Customer service is really unsatisfying so dont bother. JUST BE CAREFUL"
5,Easy fix for the stickers...,"First off, I love my Rubik's Cube. I have to buy a new one because I lost it, but its one of the greatest 'toys' I've ever found. Once you learn how to solve it, you get addicted. You never stop solving. I seriously recommend this to anyone who has the patience to learn how to solve it. And by the way, guessing doesn't work. But that aside, there's an easy fix to the sticker problem. When a laminate comes off of one of the stickers, paint over it with clear nail polish. Trust me, it works. Also, to make it spin easier and prolong the life of the guts of the cube, solve it and pop off opposite side centers. Then put Vaseline in the two spaces. Put the cube back together and spin it for a while. It will spin much easier (a savior for your hands) and will also keep the insides from rubbing away. Just a few tips from a cube massah."
1,Squeaky and Peely,"I was playing with Rubik's cube the last time it was hot in the 80's, and I just recently bought a few of these. The first two I bought in a store was made by Winning Moves which work the way I remember the cube to be in the old days. Then I decided I want one in my office and order this one through Amazon because it offers free shipping for Prime Members.This cube was bad right out of the package, and within three days of moderate use, the clear color stickers started peeling off the white background stickers on many of the faces. This cube is also very loud, sometime squeaky, and often get stuck when used in medium or high speed. There is a HUGE difference between this and the Winning Moves one.I guarantee I have nothing to do with the Winning Moves company, and this is actually the first time I have disliked a product enough to write a review on Amazon. But there is no excuse for a bad version of a product that has been around for 30 years! Don't buy this version."
3,"inexpensive cube, cheap quality","This is both an inexpensive and cheap cube. You're getting what you pay for it.I bought this cube to replace my original 80's cube which has deteriorated. I use this cube a lot (spending 20 minutes a day with it at least) and within two weeks all but the white and center stickers began peeling up. After another week, all but the white stickers are in very poor condition. I'm frustrated by the poor quality of the stickers.The turning of the cube was very silky when I first got it, but has become a little less easy--still quite acceptable though."
5,tips for the stickers,"I love my rubiks cube. I'm a first year college student, and I constantly find myself pulling out my cube in class to help me get through the boring lectures. It keeps my hands busy, and my mind in check. It's also a great conversation starter! People are so impressed when they see a solved cube. I see several people have had problems with the stickers, but let me suggest clear nail polish. My stickers started to come off after the first week, but I just peeled the laminate off and painted over them with clear nail polish. Not only does it protect the stickers, but now my cube is ""shinier and prettier"" than when I first bought it. Let me add that my younger sisters will be recieving their first cubes for Christmas this year. That and a few lessons with The Master."
1,Not for the serious cuber,"I cube a lot...have been a winner in a lot of local competitions, usually spending an hour or two every day on a cube, so I know my cubes.If you're a serious cuber, do not buy this cube. The stickers peel off, the turning radius is weak and it's very squeaky...not good if you're trying to cube in a library. The helpful hints are way too basic and aren't going to bring you up to the high level of competitive cubing.Save your money... [...]."
5,The Rukik's Cube we all know and love,This is the original Rubik's Cube. It's a great little toy. It's sturdy and will last for years. It's hours of fun.
3,not very durable,"I play with this afew times a week (only 3 months old), and it's all loose already, it looks like it will be fall apart anytime now."
5,what's to say? hours of fun!,"even after solving it, you can play with it over and over, challenging yourself to make better time."
3,Good but hard to keep interest,"I bought this toy for my 11 year old daughter. (I had one as a young girl and it drove me crazy!) Anyway, she wanted one and I had hoped she would have better luck than me, needless to say, it lasted 2 days. My husband, myself and my daughter all tried the helpful hints, but oh me, they were not so helpful."
3,Very very very very good puzzzle,even though im not a 'guienuss' (i probably spelled that wrong. ^.^ whoops) it was a very fun toy. i had even more fun by taking it apart and putting it back in the correct order. tehe.
3,Rubik's Cube Brain Teaser,"We love to play this puzzle. It's very challenging, but fun to try. Unfortunately the construction of this cube is made in a way that some of the colored stickers have fallen off after only a month of using this item. We haven't picked at them, but two of the orange colors are now missing. This is dissapointing."
4,it lasted me about 2 months,i bought this cube around February and it lasted me about a month. the stickers started to peel within 3 days. but hell it's rubik's any real cuber knows that that is going to happen. just get some cubesmith stickers to replace them. i learned to solve on this one and it broke when my time was around 1:30. if you want to continue cubing then i would recommend getting a DIY cube. all in all i thought it was great just not that durable
4,Great puzzle,"It's really adictive, I haven't solved it yet and i'm trying really hard to make it because I want to solve it myself without any help or tutorial but it's really hard but it's interesting and it helps a lot to use the brain in a enterteinment way."
4,Makes flight time go by fast!,The rubik's cube was something I enjoyed as a kid so I bought one for my 14 year old daughter and she loves it and is much better than I ever was. I think the booklet has helped her quite a bit.
5,Rubiks Revenge,"I had one of these when I was much younger, used to solve it with no problem. I love challenging the kids in the neighborhood with combination races."
2,rubiks cube,I got this in no time at all. My boy loves it and plays with it everyday. We have had it only for a month and the color stickers are already coming off. Other than that he loves it!
4,Der Rubik!,"Sigh! I used to be able to blow these off in under five minutes.Now I'm old and getting senile, so takes a bit longer. I wish I remembered how I did it :-)"
3,My 2nd purchase was not as good as the 1st one!,"I bought 2 rubik's cube from the same seller, exactly the same item. (I bought the 1st one several days earlier than the 2nd one) The 1st one was a good quality product, but the 2nd one was not as good as the 1st one."
3,An extemely fun toy not well built!,"This is a very fun toy, but unfortunately, the stickers aren't very sturdy. The color first starts to fade. Then, slow, the corners of the colors start peeling off. Now i have a cube that looks like a hobo."
5,Rubik's Challenge,My kids loved the Rubik's cube. We had just rented and watched Pursuit of Happyness before Christmas and my children were fascinated by the cube in the movie - so great stocking stuffer!
4,Rubik cube,"What kid doesn't want to try this toy? Well, not many can actually make it work and it does get frustrating. Great piece to have laying around for kids or adults to pick up and try to solve."
2,Rubik cube by Hasbro,"If you want to just sovle the cube and that's it, it's for you. If you want to increase you speed, get other cubes. You can buy other cube from Amazon for $5 more and top of the line like Dayan Zhanchi (won't pop), or Alpha V. Most of your time with the Rubik is trying to get the ""almost perfect alignment"" so you can turn the layers....wasting time and frustration. This cube won't pop and will be loosen after awhile. You can get this from Walmart or Target for $10. See what the professional use. To me, this cube worths $3 and locks up like there's no tomorrow."
4,stickers and spring tension,"Add some lubricant and it makes a great cube, pity stickers come off after a couple of days of speedcubing. Best to just remove the stickers and paint the faces. Works great if you're lucky and get one with equal spring tension on all 6 faces."
4,Rubik's Cube,"The cube is smooth and rotates quite well. But, the new stick on colors are not very good. They begin to wear off in a matter of hours. By the time I had the solution worked out the stickers were peeling off. Unfortunately all the squares are white under the stickers."
3,Alright,"The cube was just ok, not impressed. I was very dissapointed that the advertising states that it comes with helpful hints; well it does not. When purchasing a cube there are not many options, so this one was not that bad."
2,Worked great..... at first.,"I was excited to receive the cube and went to work on solving it right away. The instruction booklet it came with was very helpful, except for a few confusing steps, but I was finally able to solve the cube. The cube came with a nice little stand for putting it on display. I ran into trouble when after a few weeks the clear plastic covering the colored stickers started to peel. So I pulled the clear piece off, leaving only the colored sticker. This was a mistake because soon the color was completely gone. Now I am left with an almost unusable cube. There are replacement stickers available online, but this seems like a hassle. A painted cube would be perfect, but I am not sure if that is sold anywhere. Overall, I had a great time solving the cube, but was disappointed by the lack of durability."
2,Bad bad quality,"I own several rubiks cube and since my old ones are wearing out I thought I should get a new one. To my disappoint, this one which I order was really really horrible. It was so light weight it felt so cheap. And the edges are so rough it's so difficult to turn it. I wished that I had heeded other comments first before buying this because now I regret it. ): It is really really hard to turn and the quality just sucks."
2,"Rubix Mishap, but I like them anyway!","I got it and it turned out to be a 25th Anniversary. Which means that the stickers peel of like none other. So, immeadiately after taking it out of the box, I noticed the stickers already coming off. Sent it back and got a Refund. But I bought a new one in a local store and played with it for 2 possibly 3 weeks and solved it. I now have a 4x4x4. The normal 3x3x3 is a great toy. Always fun to do it for some reason and extremely educational in terms of problem solving.In the End, I have nothing wrong with the toy, I just hate the 25th Anniversary Cubes with the silver stickers. The White stickers are alright, but not that good."
5,Good Frustrations,"My 8-year old grandson gets frustrated, but the Rubik's Cube exercises his intellectual capabilities and strengthens his determination. It is almost indestructible and keeps kids of all ages (7-77) intensely focused for a very long time."
1,What??????????,I didn't buy this! I don't even have a rubik's cube for pete's sake! Give me a break here!! Where is all this coming from.......things I didn't buy?
3,Not bad - but stickers don't stay on!,"This is great and comes with outstanding instructions to solve it, but the stickers come off too easily! I spent a week with this, and already one of the blue stickers has come off, and a bunch more are peeling. I'm excited to be able to solve a Rubik's cube, but I wish I hadn't paid 15 bucks for a toy that lasted a week"
3,A good colectible,"This rubik is a nice item to have, but as a collectible. Although it works pretty fine, the color stickers peal off after some use. New its really nice, a fine peace of art, but after some use looks like an old toy."
2,"Just for collection, not for use!","This cube, is only for keep it. I try to use it, and one week later all stickers were damage."
3,"Good mechanics, lousy stickers","This is a very lightweight cube with excellent movement. The stickers, however, are not very durable. They feature a clear plastic coating that peels off easily, and the colored stickers below are not very colorfast. I purchased two of these cubes and had to buy replacement stickers within a few weeks. But otherwise I am very pleased with feel and rotation of this cube."
3,Rubik's wrist strain,"I suddenly decided I wanted to revisit an earlier period of my life; so I bought a Rubik's cube. Memory of it suddenly came back to me as I attempted to solve its mystery- which I never have, yet. It is what it is, and that's what it is.I didn't remember the cube to be so hard to turn or manipulate. Granted I'm a lot older now, but still the plastic connections seem unusually difficult to operate. It ruins the experience for me. I guess if I used it every day for an hour, it would be quite easy to work in say a year. Especially after I had wrist surgery from the abuse it caused my body. Enough of that.I like seeing it there in its little triangle stand, beckoning me to grab it up and abuse my mind and wrists some more. It does bring back memories; memories of a simpler time for me."
3,Pretty decent for what it's worth,"(Written by my 16 year old son)I am a big fan of the TV show, so I was excited to get this game. Of course, this game can get boring fast sometimes, but what do you realy expect from a game based on a game show where you open suitcases and se what number is inside? At the same time, this game is also sort of addictive. I also like the other two modes of gameplay that this offers-high low where you open a case, and then guess of the next case you open will have a value in it that is higher or lower than the case you just opened-and the vazult game, where you try to get the case numbers to match the code.Overall, if you're not a fan of this series, don't bother with this game. However, if you enjoy the series and can find this game at a cheap price, go ahead and pick it up."
5,Easy to play and lots of fun!,"If you are a fan of the TV show, you've got to get this game. The whole family takes turns playing it. It is compatible with the DS system too, which makes it nice to swap out with friends who have other handheld game systems."
3,Novelty wears off fast,"I am an adult gameboy player and I try to find games to play while waiting at the dr's office or traveling. I enjoy game show games so I thought I would give deal or no deal a try.The positives are it is very easy to play on all modes. Just about anyone from age 5 and up could play one of the modes. If you have a gameboy link cable, and 2 copies of the game it is fun to play against someone and see who makes better choices and wins more money.The cons are this game did get boring fast. There are 3 games to play. The traditional pick a case game from tv, a high low game in which you just guess if the next case will be higher or lower then the previous one, and a vault game in which you have to guess which three cases are in the vault by high low clues.If you can pick this game up at a low price then I would recommend it, espcially if you get 2 games and use the gameboy link cables since it is best played as a 2 player game."
4,A mediocre book on an excellent subject,"Contrary to the review below, this is not a terrible book. I can see what Stacy means when she complains that Anderson selects from the scientific literature only that which supports his belief system, but just about every author writing on this subject does that as well. Anderson shows good intuition in choosing a subject -- cultural evolution -- that in my opinion represents the most important category for nonfiction books today. And while he may not be on the cutting edge of his subject, he is in the right area. The very fact that this book is out there adds to the weight of literature in this area. So while Anderson's thinking may be fairly mediocre, it is not as bad as the review below makes it seem. There were several good insights and a lot that confirms and restates what others have written on this most interesting subject."
1,Sophomoric and Pseudo-Intellectual,"I saw this book in a list of new titles in a friend's e-mail and thought the title was interesting, so I bought it. I have read widely in this area and was looking forward to some new thinking about the subject. However, this self-proclaimed ""hot tub journalist"" is merely evangelizing his own twisted brand of Buddhism and Scientism. He is naively unaware of most of the dynamic developments in his field, and his condescending ""we all know better, don't we"" style is full of ironic put-downs and was at times annoying but mostly just boring. He has selected from the scientific literature only that which supports his thinly-veiled belief system, and these gross distortions are obvious to anyone familiar with the subject matter. If you want to read something good on the subject, I recommend you forget this lightweight and check out some books by Ken Wilber."
4,Don't judge the soundtrack by it's movie.,"Where this joke of a biopic fell painfully, shamefully short, its soundtrack stands on its own with top-shelf Blues Brothers tunes, as good as (if not better) than those done by popular tribute acts. At the very least, Belushi fans will want this for the inclusion of ""2000-Pound Bee"" by The Ventures, and they'll know why. ""Love Kills"" by Joe Strummer is a suprisingly enjoyable tune, as well as the Chiklis-doing-Belushi-doing-Cocker version of ""You Are So Beautiful"". The two songs done as substitue Blues Brothers tunes, ""You Don't Know Like I Know"" and ""634-5789"" (never performed by Belushi, but appearing in 'Blues Brothers 2000' years later) are enjoyable on their own. Who knew that Michael Chiklis was such a good vocalist?"
4,A good review of tests used for job selection.,"If you want a good introduction to the sort of tests used for selecting people for jobs this may be the book for you ! It describes all the main sorts of tests and how they are put together; in addition guidance is given on preparation and the sorts of strategies you can use when taking tests. Sure it does not contain thousands of examples but given that there are many, many different sorts of tests this is perhaps no bad thing. Infact you can then move onto other Kogan Page books on testing and be in a much better position to do the practice questions they contain. I would certainly recommend this book to all those who think that testing will be part of their next interview."
3,A Good Pentecostal/Charismatic Study Bible,"The NIV Full-Life Study Bible is based on the NIV,which,for better or worse, seems very popular today. It is a balanced translation, in between a formal equivalence(word-for-word)and dynamic equivalence(basically thought-for-thought). Words have been added to, or deleted from, the Greek text of the New Testament. Ergo, one is reading the words of men mixed in with the Words of God. The annotations in this Bible are from a traditional Pentecostal perspective; with 4 total pages taken up with the subject of wine, expressing a temperance viewpoint rather than the actual 1st century meaning of wine. This is a good Study Bible, with nice, dark print. However, keep in mind that the editor was a member of the Assemblies of God, and the annotations reflect their belief system."
5,The NIV Full Life Study Bible,"Just being a new Christian, this bible is very easy to read and understand. The notes are very well explained helping me to want to grasp more. I recommend this for those who tend to get lost reading the traditional ones. I like it so much, I'm purchasing another one for my husband!"
2,overly dogmatic commentary and articles,"(I am reviewing this as a pastor within the AoG). The commentay and the articles written within were very narrow in their theology. They were dogmatic on some points that are very debateable, even within pentecostal circles. The article on wine and alcohol were honestly written with very shameful scholarship. The idea that it is sin for a christian to drink alcohol is anti-biblical. Jesus made kool-aid?! ""Mixed wine"" does not refer to wine dilluted with a lot of water, it is different types of wine mixed with spices. The dogmatic eschatology was also troublesome. The basically preached their pre-trib eschatology chart with the same conviction that they preached the divinity of Christ! There was not more then one point of view presented even int he most secondary and controversial maters."
5,A good conservatory commentary,"This study bible is really of great help in studying the Charismatic Pentecostal side of the bible. It has some great articles of practical theological aid. F.x the articles of wine in the bible. They really come as a help in a time were (specially in Europe) Abstainens in Europe from Alcohol is wied on as ""Black Christianity"". It present a good case for the Christian who finds it wrong to drink wine with alcohol. If your are looking for a ""All sold out, radikal study bible, you need not look any further. It is this one you need."
5,Ths is the Absolute Best Book for Teen Girls I've ever seen!,"I love Dawn Martin and her refreshing approach to teach teen girls (I am 15) like myself how to better ourselves. I took this book to my school and could not get it back for three months, because all my girlfriends wanted to borrow it! When I finally got it back it was so torn and tattered, that my Mom just bought me another one. There's lots of great exercises and ""Food for Thought"", that really made me think about stuff that had never crossed my mind before. Dawn is definitely my role model! I would recommend this book to every teen girl, and especially for girls that have ""lost their way"" or feel confused about sex issues. This book was far better than any old fashioned sex education class in our school!"
4,mr.,"The cuisinart fine grater disc does a very good job at grating hard cheeses as I gave it 4 stars, would have given it 5 stars if it were cheaper in price."
4,fine grater blade,"works good, we grate hard italian cheese mostly and are satisfied.We purchase chunks as they're cheaper as opposed to grated.We grate enough to use in 2 or 3 weeks.Wish the plastic atand the blade sits on had a stronger feel to it.Feel as if we can't press as hard as we'd like to.That aspect however is a result though inheirent in the overall design of the food processor"
2,doesn't work with carrots,I tried to make grated carrots for salad but they turned into mush.Maybe I am doing something wrong.
5,"Fine, fine, fine.",If you are looking for a very fine cut this blade is for you. I used it on a block of Parmesan cheese. The look was as fine as the round containers on store shelves. Very pleased.
3,Results not excellent for grating horseradish,"I can find horseradish only one week of the year at my grocery store. I usually buy several pounds.I use the food processor to chop or grate the horseradish and stir in juice from red beets. I freeze the results in small plastic containers. This approach is much less expensive than buying prepared horseradish.I bought this fine grating disc mostly for horseradish. The results are not excellent, because the grated horseradish does not fall directly into the work bowl. Instead, it piles up on the disc until it spills over the edge of the disc, because there are no perforations on this disc."
5,Make Puerto Rican pasteles and Jamaican potato pudding easily,"I actually bought this because of the few negative reviews about the mush like consistency it creates with potatoes, or other root vegetables. That's exactly the texture you need to make pasteles and Jamaican pudding. Forget about hours of grating batata and green bananas or any other root vegetables. This makes it super fast to make what would normally be an all day event. Buy it, your knuckles will thank you."
4,Works excellent but has no built-in power supply,"It is great converter. It works excellent with all video systems signals. I tested it for PAL, SECAM and NTSC in automatic recognizing mode and there were no problems. Convertion quality is just fine. Only ""bug"" is that converter has no built-in universal power supply. It was shipped with 2 separate external modules for 110 and 220V."
4,Quick and Easy to Learn and Fun,"My adult children and spouses, my husband (who hates games) and I played this at the lake this summer. Easy to learn, fun to play, and you can quit when you want without having it go on and on. We had fun with it and played it a couple times that weekend. We played it again with my elderly mother and sister at home. It's fun to play and you learn things about everyone, even those you thought you knew well. Probably not a game guys would like to play for hours and hours like Monopoly, etc but they have fun learning and thinking they know the answer and finding they're wrong. It's light-hearted and fun with couples."
4,Perfect game,"Just a quick review to say that I love this game! I received it as a Christmas gift and we've played it several times since with many different people. Everyone we play with loves it. It's pretty quick, not a lot of instructions and you get to know a lot about the people that you play with. We did mix it up a few times and played the 5 least favorite things which was also very fun! If you're on the fence about buying it, I'd say it's worth it."
4,My grandchildren love it!,"When we have our grandchildren over, they want to play this game. All ages can play together, and we learn new things about each other every time we play. It's great for interactions between children, parents, and grandparents."
5,Whoonu,"We played this game on vacation last summer with adults and kids ages 7, 8 and 13. What a blast! We laughed till our sides hurt. The 13 year old who was raised in the country and has been in a mall maybe 3 times in his entire life chose the mall as his number one favorite over 7 other choices of things that we were sure he loved! Who knew?! His mother is still befuddled over that one! It was so much fun that I bought it for christmas for other grandchildren. A game for all ages if they can read and if they can't it's a way to learn with a little help plus they learn to make choices and decisions in a really fun way. You learn all kinds of things about people you thought you knew! As usual a cranium game is a winner."
2,4 video songs for $25.00 a rip off,This is just a video of 4 songs. It is not a live concert.It is not enough songs on it to pay $25.00. The videos aren'tthat special either. You will be disappointed.
5,This is a GREAT Cookbook!,"I highly recommend this extraordinary cookbook to everyone. I have been looking everywhere for this, so I am very happy to have found it on Amazon. The recipes by themselves are terrific, but this cookbook offers so much more -- tidbits and insights on family values, Christianity and related topics. The author is the lady behind the very successful ""Light Weigh"" weight loss program that has been featured on EWTN and various newspapers around the county. These make great gifts. Bon appetit!"
5,Smooth Jazz vs. Straight ahead Jazz,"Okay I know there is this massive debate between smooth jazz fans and the straight ahead jazz purists... And as a music composition grad from a well known music school in Boston, I see things from the purists point of view. With that in mind, this CD could and should definitely receive air play on a smooth Jazz station. But its complex enough for me to tell this artist studied his craft, and doesn't offend the critical music ear. He successfully walks that line between the straight ahead and the smooth... great job Earl!"
5,Takumi vs. Ryosuke,"At last, Takumi faces off against Ryosuke Takahashi and his RX-7. The race is exciting, intense, and completely epic. Even more so than the other races so far, it is as much a mental battle as it is a physical one. The writer/artist Shigeno does a great job in choreographing it and really digs into Takumi and Ryosuke's personalities and thought processes, especially Ryosuke. In Book 1 he seems like an arrogant rich snot but by Books 4 and 5 you understand that he is all about being the best, in racing and in everything else. He is the ultimate competitor. This is one of the best showdowns in Initial D."
2,Disappointing At Best,"As a JR fan since day one, I was very disappointed by this effort. With few exceptions, those being the Lennon/McCartneycovers and Snake, there's very little here to justify the pricetag. Also, the new arrangement of Midnight Special is, at leastto my ear a disaster. Too bad! I have seen JR twice in concert and his shows are always top notch. This CD just doesn't measureup."
1,Misleading Title,"The title is completely misleading. The book does not tell you how to build a complete coal forge, it only tells you how to build the stand and vent. To build the most important (and in fact the only critical part of a coal forge), the firepot, you are told to buy another publication from the same author. This book is a complete waste of time and money. The firepot instructions may be fine or they may be junk. I'm not willing to risk another $15 to fine out."
1,Even nudity doesn't help ease the pain.,"Bad acting, plot holes, unattractive strippers, a non-threatening killer, low body count, cheap production values and an uninspired script filled with annoying characters. If I was Chuck Norris I would have roundhoused this DVD straight into the trash can then dropped some evil greasin' on it.The DVD case promises strippers getting offed by some wacko with a hatchet and yea that happens but it's duller than watching snot dry. The bulk of the movie is wasted on the relationship between the detective investigating the case and his girlfriend (who happens to be the main stripper girl). She's trying to get into law school and the boyfriend doesn't pay enough attention to her, blah, blah, blah. Who cares?! Get back to the killing.There is nudity, but not the kind you want to see."
1,Avoid this dumb 'Scream' clone,This movie sucked more than 'Cutthroat Alley'.They tried to make some kind of 'Showgirls' meets 'Scream' type of movie but ended up with this piece of crap.Dont buy this crappy so called slasher film.
3,not listened to,"I have not heard this CD. I ordered it and found out that Bill Heid the ""Organist"" is playing the ""Piano"" on this album. Since I love jazz organ, I decided not to buy it and sent it back unheard. I've been told that Johnnie Bassett plays a mean blues guitar."
1,Waste of Money!,"This blender is terrible. The blades just spin around and leave the food whole. When you put ice in - same thing - the blades spin and ice just sits on top of them, they don't pull anything down. Don't waste your money!"
1,can't make pesto OR hummus,"I have this blender, and it really doesn't do much, things get stuck like making hummus for example-- soft chick peas are a problem for this blender...and pesto- just basil leaves, garlic, and oil seem to slow this thing down. Smells like burning motor as well.I do not recommend this for day to day uses. This blender has a small capacity as well, meaning that several batches of soup etc-- need to be blended over a period of time.The chopper on this makes everything nice and even though.Also for day to day uses, Go with the Stick blender... which is perfect for hummus, soups, pesto, baby food and smoothies."
3,The fuses blew!,"It lasted only 4 years for us, rather occasional use. I think it is a roll of the dice. If you got it for a song at a tag sale fine, but don't waste good money on this. I am disappointed -- I thought Cuisinart was better quality."
4,Early returns,"Blender attachment of surprisingly good quality, glass and very solid plastic base.Food processor attachment works just like a regular one would- I do not see the need for something bigger than this. Just made a big batch of hummus (16 oz.). !!!That's all I gotta say -give it 4 out of 5 stars.. Bc I'm not yet completely confident of its ice crushing abilities."
2,Worked great... for the first 11 months.,"I loved this blender while it was working. I mostly used it to make smoothies with frozen fruit. I love that it has seamless buttons so food can't get caught in little cracks. I rarely used the food processor.After about 11 months, mine also started to smell like it was catching fire - however, it was the black piece in the bottom of the blending jar, which was basically being ""Shaved"" by the base motor. I had to order a replacement ""blender cutting assembly"" from the Cuisinart website for $15 with shipping, only to have it happen again.Plus, it was a pain to clean - the base threading didn't match up well with the jar and screwing and unscrewing the base was often difficult. We've replaced the blender with another brand but I have kept the bottom motor part for the processor."
1,"Smokes, Very Loud, and Can't Blend Ice","Someone gave me this blender as a wedding present last year. Its not as nice as you would hope. The processor works okay, although either the blades aren't really sharp or its not very powerful, because it takes a lot longer than a normal processor. The blender is just awful though. It has trouble just making a smoothie. It can't handle ice cubes or frozen fruit very well.The worst part, for both the blender and the processor after about 60 seconds of blending, it starts to smell like smoke. And this is the loudest kitchen appliance I have ever heard."
1,TOO NOISY,This thing is a monster. I swear it needs a muffler. It is powerful and we use it almost every day but I swear something is missing as it is LOUD. Great power but TOO LOUD
2,"Bad quality, bad service....terrible noise ....","HORRIBLY loud, when I use the food processor my baby is so scared that i have to put him in another room. I myself can not stand that terrible screech! I definetely will NOT recommend it to someone with a baby. The cutting assembly broke. I bought it thinking Cuisinart is a great company. Now i am doubting it. Specially after calling customer service. The service was very slow and the rep was trying politely to get rid of me. First he said that these food processors are loud in general, so unless you see a smoke coming of the motor there is nothing really wrong (???). then he said that i am not eligible for a warranty based on the manufacture date, but since i bought it 1 year after manufacturing he might consider it after i fax lot's of papers.... I am thinking should i waste my time and do all these steps or just go and buy another one ??? But which one? Most likely not Cuisinart..."
1,Broke 2 of 'em in less than 1 month!,"This is the fist piece of junk that we've purchased from Cuisinart! The second was a ""Smart Stick"" immersion blender that also broke (though it took almost 6 months to break). We purchased this food processor from them on July 23, 2007 and 3 weeks later it broke! We returned it, received a replacement and it broke 4 days later. The lights went on, but there was nobody home and nothing moved or could be heard! Ok, you're probably wondering what are we chopping up with this thing, BRICKS?!? Oh, contrar, we used this to chop up my infant sons baby food, rather than purchase any of the suspect ready made stuff. The only reason that I gave them 1 star is because Amazon doesn't do fractions! I am satisfied that I will not buy anything EVER again with the name Cuisinart on it! To us, Cuisinart stands for stuff that you want to give to people that you really don't like. Because with normal usage, they will be buying a replacement in less than a year!"
2,food processor is no good,"I gave this item 2 stars because the blender is fine. My food processor is very hard to assemble and the blade attachment gets stuck putting it on and taking it off. I just tried to make almond butter and the whole thing fell apart. I am not under warranty anymore, but hardly ever used it due to the sticking, so falling apart after minimal use is extra disappointing."
3,mine broke too,"mine broke too... i have ordered parts to replace the broken part (what they call the ""cutting assembly"") two times now. at $15.00 per part and 5.95 for shipping... I am thinking i should save the money and get a new (read DIFFERENT) machine.bummer - because other than that, i really liked it."
2,Powerful but broke after one year.,This blender was purchased for my wife so she could dwell in smoothie heaven. It is powerfull and works well with frozen fruit or ice blended drinks. The blender died just after one year. Does not respond to any button pushes on the keypad. Lights work but the blades do not spin.
4,Have no problems,"I have been using the product for about four years now. I have not yet used the processor as of today. I will soon. I have used the blender so much for smoothies, shakes. I will try later on this week on making raw soup with it. I gave it four stars because I have not used the processor part. I can say the processor part is small but it will work right now for me on getting started with some of my raw food dishes."
1,Poor product,"I have owned two Cuisinart products. One was a coffee maker that ground beans and brewed coffee. Great concept, but the grinder always got stuck in the coffee maker. I would have to use pliers and screwdrivers to pry it out. I tried to grease the grinder- nothing worked. I threw away the coffee maker.Today, I used my Cuisinart blender's food processor for the first time. The chopping blade is now stuck half way inserted into the preparation bowl and will not come out. Nor will it go on. Nothing will dislodge the blades, and I cannot use the food processor. This is exactly the same problem.Long story short- I can recommend staying at the Cuisinart Spa in Anguilla in the West Indies, but I cannot recommend any kitchen products made by them."
1,Its loudness supersedes any functionality,"We got this as a gift several years ago, and I never use it because I remember it being so loud. However, since it's practically brand new due to lack of use, and since I'm really a hand-chopper / immersion blender kinda gal and rarely use a food processor / full-sized blender anyway, my husband doesn't want me to get rid of it in case there is a rare time we need a food processor or blender - after all, no sense in getting rid of a functioning one that was free, right?I finally used it again today. I wondered if maybe it was as bad as I remembered... and it was. I used the food processor function, and it was so incredibly loud it was almost intolerable. And it's not because of the types of foods I was blending - the foods were soft (canned beans, eggs, etc.). It blended the ingredients well enough, but the loudness is such a turn-off that I cannot discourage potential buyers enough, especially for the price they're trying to sell it for!"
1,You get what you paid for.,"It's a cheap blender--and that's the problem. If you want to make smoothies, forget this blender. I have to slightly thaw frozen fruit in order to blend and it still doesn't make a smooth smoothy--lots of lumps left that will not go through a straw. It doesn't not put food down into the blade the way I expect a blender to. You have to open it up, stick a spoon down and move fruit around. I don't really know what it's good for. You can't make drinks in it, and it's easier to make bread crumbs in a food processor."
1,Don't buy this thing,"I received this as a gift a while ago, but almost never use it because it is so LOUD! I can't believe it is not illegal to create such a high decibel level with an appliance that you need to be only a couple of feet from in order to turn it on. It is really painful to use. I doubt if I will find out about the part that so many other reviewers talk about breaking because I hate, hate, hate to use it. If I had any idea how to return it (since I don't know where it came from) I sure would."
1,Great Until It Breaks,I've purchased two of the Cuisinart blenders (a SmartPower Seven-Speed- broke after about 45 uses and a SmartPower Duet - broke after about 30 uses) and both have the same the problem with the black plastic gasket on the bottom breaking. (Call me dumb for purchasing the second one!) Really a cheap part for the Cuisinart product. (All I've used these blenders for was fruit smoothies! I doubt the Duet would have made it throught the first challenge of food processing!) The Cuisinart product may be smart but they sure aren't very strong. I certainly would not classify them as heavy-duty! An improvement would be making the gasket either metal or a plastic with more give. (I won't be going back for thirds!)
2,"Versatile, but breaks easily","I have owned the duet for approximatley one year. I use the blender mostly for milkshakes. The food processor is small, which is ok with me, except I do not like the feed tube. With a processor this small, it's unlikely one would use it to slice or shred, so why bother with the slicing disk and therefore the feed tube? Also, the feed tube makes it too tall to work with right under kitchen cabinets--you must pull it out to use. The motor is loud for both appliances. And the biggest problem is that mine broke this morning while I attempted to make a milkshake rendering both applicances unusable, since now the blade will not rotate. There is a small black plastic disk that fits between the base and the jar that has shattered all on its own. After reading your other reviews, I see I am not the first person to experience this. Buy this item with caution."
3,Great until a piece breaks,"This is the second duet by Cuisinart I have purchased. The same piece has broken on both of them. The plastic piece on the base that fits into the bottom of the glass jar has cracked and broken on me twice. At first I thought I didn't fit the pieces together correctly and that it was my fault. I exchanged it for a new one and the same thing happened to me again, this time I know it wasn't me because now I make sure they fit correctly before I blend. When it is in working order it is a great blender, loud but very good. I wish all pieces were metal."
3,Liked it until a part broke,"This was a gift and I loved it because it gave me two appliances that I needed in one, a blender and a food processor. My concern is that the locking mechanism on the lid of the food processor portion broke off when it fell 4 inches from my cabinet to a vinyl floor. Now the processor is not usable. Additionally, the floor onto which it fell is soft and even glass when dropped from a considerable height, doesn't usually break. I noticed that someone else from WA had a similar experience so I'm wondering if there may have been some defect in the product. I will contact Cuisinart about replacement parts (as advised by the store that sold it to my gift purchaser)."
3,Fine for Lighter Use,"I've had mine for a few years and we only use it about once a week. So far the only problem has been the blade assembly locking up. The motor still seems strong, so I've just ordered a new blade assembly and gasket. We don't use the food processor part as it is too small for us, so I can't review that part.I hope it lasts at least 2 more years. We'll see."
3,High Replacement Parts Costs but Great Customer Service,"Do consider the cost of owning this product before buying, if it's likely you will need a replacement part. I broke the glass blender jar and also the plastic collar. I went to the Cuisinart website and saw that the replacement glass blender jar is $22, plus shipping.I would say, however, that their customer service is great. I had trouble replacing the blender ""collar"" with one that fits correctly when I purchased outside of the Cuisinart website. Cuisinart is sending me a replacement collar for free ($5 value plus shipping).The Duet comes with so many different pieces for the food processor that you may lose or even break components. Judging by how many people ""Also bought"" replacement parts, this is not uncommon.I have actually broken the glass jar twice, as it tipped out of a bottom cabinet and fell about 2 inches. I found repolacement parts at thrift stores, but it's harder and harder to find now, as many others need to do them same."
1,Not worth the name,"Very dissappointed in the dual unit. Very loud operation when food processing, food processor bowl broke after 2 or 3 years of use. As with most small appliances these days, hardly any quality left, even with the good brand names."
1,"Seemed nice at first, but....","We bought this about a year and a half ago, and absolutely LOVED it at first, but then started having problems with it. First, the blender started running rougher and rougher. Eventually the blade in the blender attachment completely seized up. In the meantime two parts cracked off of the food processor attachment while just attaching/removing it from the base, making the food processor completely unsafe to use. So this ""great"" machine that we loved is now completely useless and had to be thrown away. Obviously it's not made to last, so don't waste your money!"
1,Terrible,"I received this blender/food processor as a gift for my wedding shower. The only thing I wanted it for was to make smoothies in the summer time. I generally like to make one serving for myself. This blender does not blend unless you fill the whole thing up, which is such a waste for me. It's also loud and smells, with white dusty smoke that comes out of it. Last week, the motor finally died. I had used it probably 15 times over the course of 3 and a half years. Upon calling Cuisinart, I found that it is out of warranty and I would have to pay to get it fixed. No thank you. I will be buying another brand. I wish I would have used it more so it broke within the warranty period, but because it just didn't work well, I didn't use it much. Such a shame, because I thought Cuisinart was a good name!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this blender a few years ago to replace an OLD blender that actually still worked well. I liked the combined function of food processor and blender and like others, thought the Cuisinart brand was a good guarantee. First, the NOISE was always an issue....my husband wondered whether something was wrong with it when I brought it home; I talked to the staff at Macy's and they said they agreed, it's loud. NOW after a few years of light use (at most 1x/month) the ""cutting assembly"" with the blades on it has cracked and the blender is leaking. I see some others have had the same problem. I'm not sure I am going to spend $21 with shipping to replace the part, am seriously considering replacing this blender.Cuisinart BFP-703 SmartPower Duet Blender/Food Processor, White"
2,Don't waste your money,I purchased this product about 2 years ago. It lasted less than a year before the blender jar blade came apart. I still use the mini chopper occasionally for making small amounts of salad dressing or pesto.This product is also rather lightweight compared to my most recent Kitchen Aid Blender.I would recommend buying a heavy-duty blender and nice food processor instead if you can spare the funds.
1,Plastic piece will break,"My mother-in-law and I both had this blender. Hers broke in a couple of months. I was lucky that mine lasted a couple of years. It is a great blender for crushing ice for smoothies/icees, etc., however it has a flaw that the piece that the pitcher sits on when it spins is made out of plastic. It eventually cracks from the heat/friction produced. I bought the Oster Beehive blender to replace it, and it has a metal piece beneath it and I have had it for a few years now with no problem. I am even happier with the Oster Beehive blender, as it is a much better quality blender which will last a lot longer than the Cuisinart one (it was also cheaper), and it crushes ice exactly as good if not better than the Cuisinart blender."
1,I despise this machine.,"I honestly don't remember where we got this, but I hope it was a gift because I'd hate to think we spent money on this thing. It's the bane of my existence at the moment. Every time I use it to make a smoothie, it completely fails to crush, chop, stir the ice, fruit or any other ingredient I put in. And for some reason one of my hands always comes away smelling like burnt rubber.If you're thinking of getting this...DON'T. It's not worth it."
3,Top should be engineered better,The top to the food processor keeps breaking. Mostly if I process vegetables in it. I have bought two so far and think the little shaft in the middle should be somehow made stronger perhaps of metal. Otherwise I really like the machine.
5,Cuisinart BFP-703,I love this product! I had one before & I had to replace it with the same thing. The other one lasted at least 15 years. It is convenient to have just one base for two kitchen appliances!
4,Good Smoothie Machine,"I just use it for making smoothies. I had one since Spring 2005, and needed a 2nd pitcher rather than waiting for the other to come out of the dishwasher to have a 2nd smoothie in the same day. The price of an additional pitcher, cover & chopper base was not much different than buying the whole blender w/ the motor base, so I got a 2nd blender.Now I have a back up if I ever burn up the motor on my first one.I don't have alot of experience w/ blenders so can't say if it's louder than others or not.But I like mine and 2 years later it's still working."
1,No Parts,Check with the manufacturer! No parts available for this model. The lid for the processor broke! Out of luck!
3,i keep having problems,"i received this as a gift recently & loved it. however, when i took it apart to clean it, i couldn't get the pieces to lock in together properly. no one in my family could help me. i returned it & the same thing happened with the next one. is it me? am i incompetant? who knows... i just know it shouldn't be this difficult.."
1,My review of Cusinart BFP -703 SmartPower Duet,"I had read information on Cusinart's Duet in February , this is just what I need. I ordered it right away. Last month the plastic tip on the processor lid broke and I have not had an opportuntity to replace it. I am very disappointed that this happened and would like to get info on how to replace or repair this part. The motor is strong but very, very loud. I can no longer use it when my 16 month old neighbor comes over, for he screams louder than a banshee in pain. I hesitate to use it when I have guests because the noise is really annoying."
2,Cuisinart's service has been the biggest problem.,"I've had mine for about two years, and use it about once/week. It worked OK (when it worked)--not too powerful, and I found the shape of the blender jar to be awkward--no funnel-type shape, just flat, doesn't mix well. Cuisinart's service is scary. Their website is of no help. I just needed a replacement rubber gasket, made three requests online and got no response. I finally called, and they sent me one gratis, but it took a month. Last night it finally just stopped working, though I'm not sure why or how. All I know is that it took everything I could muster to get it to chop tomatoes. I considered looking for a place to get it fixed, rather than just throwing it out and starting over, but coming by this info. is hard and I'm not sure it's worth it. So now I'm on the lookout for a new blender and a new food processor, and I'll stay clear of Cuisinart if I can."
2,So sad...It broke,This blender served me well for 4 years then broke :( R.I.P blender. I would not recommend getting this unless you dont mind it breaking after a few years.
1,I wish it would break.,"I got this blender/food processor as a gift and I thought ""great, I love multi-task tools!"" I was a big dissappointment. It just isn't good for so many reasons.1. The food processor is too small.2. Just doesn't blend well, stirs the bottom and that's it. It's pointless to even try ice because it hardly blends thawed mushy frozen fruit.3. As loud as it is you would think it would be a blend like a mad man.4. It would be nice if cuisinart designed some way to not have extra sharp blades with no place to store them safely. I have had this blender for 3 years and never found a good safe place to store the extra food processor blade, and I am a very organized person.It has worked for awhile for how overly crappy it is 3-4 years but like the title says, I wish it would burn out so I wouldn't feel guilty about buying a new blender and food processor."
1,Mine broke after 2.5 months,"I used this blender to make homemade baby food. After only 2.5 months, the motor smoked and broke. I have contacted customer service twice, but nothing has been done yet. Before the blender broke, it leaked liquid occasionally through the bottom although it was tightly twisted in place. Before this blender, we used a very cheap smoothy-maker as a blender. Although that blender/smoothy-maker leaked a little through the spout, it never broke after 4 years of use. I simply wanted to ""upgrade"". This product was a poor choice for an upgrade."
2,don't bother,"I have owned this POS for around a year - well made but it has always had a burning motor smell - Cuisinart said it just ""needed to break in"". I think the break-in period has come and gone and it still smells every time I use it. As a blender it is fine, but the processor just simply doesn't work. Just tried to grate some cheese and it once again failed me. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!"
5,Marc Laidlaw's books are incredible...,An EXCELLENT book. Marc Laidlaw also developed the story forand worked on the groundbreaking game Half-Life...
3,"Creepy, but poorly developed","Creepy and disturbing, but the characters are poorly developed and the plot moves jerkingly. I was left disappointed, with a head full of graphic imagery."
4,Another great book like 'The Cerimonies',"I must say that after 'Cerimonies' by TED Klien [ what happened to him?, this is another great book I read. The blurb by King and Campbell are worthy. I thank Lesuire to publish the book. Also I recommand Leisure to tell some of its writers to read this book; Picirili and Clegg chiefly. This book migght take a while to pick up but go on. I dont know why Campbell, who is a good judge of books, himself is not writing the book which a person can understand? I read 'Incarnate' I know something is happening but what? May be re-read it. This is a straight book with out anything like 'Debby is dead' or other such things. The author cleverly personifised Steven Hawkings! and that person mentioned Hawkings! Any other good stuff by this author? I will not give away story or stuff. The bottom line is 'dont play with unknown'"
4,Delightfully Wicked!,"I found ""The 37th Mandala"" to be pleasingly reminiscent of Clive Barker's ""The Great & Secret Show"". It was a delightfully wicked and creepy read.The Mandalas are reminiscent of another creation of Mr. Barker's, as well! There's that same feel and setting as with the puzzle box and the Cenobites.The care with which Marc Laidlaw takes with his characters and their surroundings shows on every page. The depiction of Tuol Sleng was eerily accurate.I think readers will enjoy getting to know Derek Crowe most of all. A sneak, scoundrel and opportunist who does not understand the series of events he's set into motion.The supporting cast of characters is intriguing as well as engaging.Should you get a chance to read this book, I do not think you will be disappointed."
5,I just wish I could write 1/10th as well as this!,"While reading one of Harry Turtledoves book, he mentioned this slim little book as one of his favorites. So I went out and bought a copy. Am I ever happy that I did! This novel is extremely well written, refreshingly politically incorrect, well researched, fast paced and interesting as well. Frankly his story of one man being sent back in time to put off the Dark Ages of Western Europe is well worth the time & coin."
5,Lest Darkness Falls,Great Book. I read Lest Darkness Falls forty years ago and then recently I found a re-release of the book on Amazon. Again it held me with a great story about time travel. Not even a barbarian could pry this book from my hands.
3,A seminal work of alternative history.,"It is a mark of the quality of this book that it has never been out of print since it was published several decades ago. This is the book that started the genre of alternative history. He throws his hero, Martin Padway, into dark ages Rome with only the contents of his pockets and his wits. Can a modern man make a comfortable life for himself in the ancient world?It is a short read, but very well written. Le Camp builds us a time travel theory and a whole world in the past without needing to engage in in-depth world building. And for students of Byzantine history, it covers an interesting era when Justinian tried to reel the Ostrogothic run Italy back into the Eastern Roman Empire. Apart from the alternative elements the book is very historically correct.As a bonus you get the David Drake novella ""To bring the light"" another alternative history about the founding of Rome."
1,Worst of the PFOS series,Terrible cd. Blaze 10 bodies is the best song by far. The ICP songs are even bad. Thank God Mike Clark came back.
2,Good for a laugh,"My friend was given this as a gift and we tried it out. The board is actually a scarf, and you're supposed to place a bunch of little candles on it which is totally safe. Then you just pick cards and ask other players multiple choice questions. Some of the questions really bothered me, but especially one that was all, ""Your daughter is a lesbian, what do you do?"" and none of the options were ""accept her for who she is."" Overall I think this game is pretty sexist and stupid, but it was a fun waste of time."
4,"Quick, interesting read","This was a pretty interesting short book, covering the early days of the bicycle up through the first half of the 20th century. Unfortunately the book reads as though the author simply ran out of steam or enthusiasm in the last few sections, as everything that takes place in the bicycle's development in the 20th century seems to be just glossed over. If you're looking for an in-depth look at how the bicycle developed through the 1800s (focusing mainly on the English cycle industry), then you wont be disappointed here. If you're looking to learn about bike development outside of England or in the 20th century, then this book may not be the best choice.All in all an interesting read with lots of detailed period artwork and advertisements."
1,"Romeo Gigli, Live or Memorex!",In the past I have come across several imitations of Romeo Gigli and have found that the coloring of the spray handle on the bottle is a good indication of a copy. With the bottle I purchased the handle was clear with a chrome spray pump instead of Black with a distressed pump which leads me to believe that the bottle I purchased was not genuine. I have since given the full bottle away to my brother due to the difficulties of returning it for a original product and will rely on personal physical contact with sales reps to ensure a authentic product.
2,Heat Wave packets,"Heat Wave packets were too large to fit in my glove or mits. Never tried to activate it, as it was too large for application. Dimensions not specified in description."
1,Not so Hot!,I am returning them due to the fact they never heat up. They simply do not work and I am greatly disappointed as they were a gift for a senior family member.HEAT WAVE Instant Reusable Hand Warmers - 1 pair
2,Not so good.,"Maybe its me, but once you use this item it appears its ruined. It does the trick on first use, but after that I was unable to get it back to its original form. Maybe it was faulty."
3,Reusable hand warmers,"These were bought for my husband to use in his unheated workshop. They're easy to use, but they don't stay warm for very long, and they can't be reheated right away. Disappointing."
3,great while they last...,"I purchased these for my daughter to use skating: heat up, toss in the skates as we drive to the arena, and then in her pockets while she skates. They worked fabulously - but after about 4 months, started leaking after we boiled them, even though we followed the directions carefully. Bought a second set, started leaking after 3 months. Bought a 3rd set, this one lasted 6 months.They're great while they last, but after purchasing 3 sets and not making it a year, I'm not going to buy any more. It's a shame, because they are the best at heating I've found."
3,Works OK,Not as sturdy as I wished for and not as easy to open and close as expected. Most of the times remains unused.
2,Overpriced for product,"We purchased this globe as a gift. Even being aware of the dimensions, it still appeared smaller than we expected. The post that the globe stands on seems very cheap and wobbly. For the high cost, we expected a higher quality. It just seemed liked a $6.99 Walmart school globe on a cheap hollow stick for $70. I'll be waiting to hear if it stands up use, or if the globe cracks or while spinning it breaks, it appears that cheap."
3,Editing nightmare,"Resolution is very good, sound is acceptable, you don't have to carry tapes, etc. BUT, editing your movies is a nightmare! The software provided is almost useless, I have tried with Ulead's MovieFactory 6 Plus and with Windows Movie Maker with no results, and finally I could do some editing with Adobe's Premiere 3.0, but the final product is somehow jerky, as if the speeds of the PC and that of the DVD player were different,no matter what I do, and the most you can get is a 30 minute or so movie; beyond that you will need a super PC to do it. Should I have known these facts I would have purchased a mini DV model."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!,"I searched for the best price on the web because I couldn't locate this camera locally. I ordered it from another company first and ran into a lot of trouble. It was a questionable company. Once I got my credit card straightened out with that company I came immediately to Amazon because I have bought so many other items from them. The camera is great. I'm so glad I can tape for so long without messing with changing the little discs every 30 minutes or so. The quality is great, too. It arrived on my birthday. What a great gift to myself. I LOVE IT!"
3,Works fine .............. if it works,"HiThis is a nice camera , very easy to use , record , play and make DVD's.But there seems to be an inherent problem with the LCD display.Mine stopped working after a week.As every operation is using the LCD touch screen ., you cannot do anything without the display.SO , its a nice camera , if it works. Take a chance.I googled after the camera failed , then i saw lot of complaints , i wish i had done that before buying.regardsAnand"
4,Good performance,"I purchased this camcorder less than 2 months ago. Overall I am happy with the performance of this product.1. The video recording is very nice in the daylight or in bright light but tends to deteriorate in the low light surroundings. I wish an in-built flashlight would have been there.2. The audio recording is superb (havent tried the bluetooth microphone yet). The in-built speakers play the audio fairly well.3. The picture quality for still images, as expected, is not great because its just 3MP. So, dont expect too much from the still images, especially, if taken in dark or low light surrondings.4. The optical zoom makes the picture quality appear grainy after 7x or 8x of zooming. The performance is fairly good when recording a video but worsens for still images.5. I love the touchscreen and the vast menu options.6. 30GB of hard disk space is enormous which is one of the primary reasons I purchased this camcorder"
4,Convenience of HDD camcorder,"I have had this unit for almost a month. It is a replacement to my old 8mm Sony Camcorder. The Hard drive recording is very convenient. The recorded video was nice & clear. The built-in image stabilizer was great. It was the right decision to purchase this one rather than the DVD base camcorder. I was able to record a complete 1.5 hours of soccer game without having to change the DVD disc. The still picture was not as great as a stand alone digital camera. Without the docking station, viewing, or transfering recorded video was kind of a hassle. Overall, I am happy with the unit even though it is a little pricey compared to the JVC brand."
2,Too BIG and HEAVY!,"This camcorder's quality and features far exceed my JVC Evario 3CCD's quality and features, plus it cheaper. But I'm returning it in favor of my inferior JVC Everio GZ-MC500 because it's too heavy and bulky. Also, it's obviously a camcorder, whereas the JVC looks like a still image camera which has allowed me to videotape people when they thought that they were being photographed (they act more natural).I am so disappointed that Sony could not make this camcorder more compact. For now, I'll have to just wait for technology to advance to where they can create the JVC-sized camcorder with Sony's HD line quality. *sad face*"
5,"Arguably, the best value in HDD camcorders!","After reading the reviews of this and similar camcorders, I knew that the features were far-and-away, light years ahead of the JVC and any camera in its price range. Thankfully, this was accurate and it has outperformed anything I have seen to-date. The picture quality is beautiful in all but poor lighting; the sound quality is excellent and it's simple enough that my 6-year old makes videos all the time. I am not exaggerating. This is how intuitive the DCR SR100 is. Extremely fast startup keeps you from missing those precious moments.Overall, an outstanding value. Get one!"
4,Great Video Camera - 3.5 rating,"I bought this video camera because I desired a neat, tidy way of storing digital videos. It is very good for that. And I also used it to copy a VHS onto DVD. Didn't know I'd appreciate that capability as much as I do. The microphone is exceptional and the video quality even in low-lighting is pretty good. I struggle getting great stills with it though - the delay between clicking the button and actual capture is too long for my liking. Maybe there is a setting to address that - I'm still learning my camera. I also find that with my hand under the safety strap, using the buttons is awkward and not comfortable. Red-eye has been a chronic problem for me. There is a way to prevent it, but you have to remember to set the setting for it first - and I never do until it's too late. Great product over all. Software does the job but not with any sophistication."
3,Sony DCR-SR100 3MP 30GB Hard Drive Handycam,"The camcorder meets or exceeds my expectations. Great picture, clear sound, the touch screen controls are great for someone who would otherwise need to use eyeglasses to read and use the small buttons on other cameras. This system also allows for cascading menus.The down side?The camera only records sound in a Dolby format. This cannot be dissabled. When one uses the USB cable to download movies, the sound cannot be played with normal Windows movie programs, it must be converted with the included software.The included software is pretty basic and non-intuitive for Windows users. It could stand some improvement."
3,a miss,"Still have not received it. It was sent to 2 other addresses where I have lived previously - one was from 1995,other from 2003- 2 totally different states that I no longer reside in. Where the company got the addresses I have no idea. I cannot track anymore because your site keeps saying Sorry - try later.I did contact Jafrum,and I hope to hear from them soon. My husband really wants that thing.Lynne Grede"
1,Buy the CIM Basic Voip over IP Instead,"I just passed the CVoice exam and this was one of the (few available) books that I used. I also used the Cisco Interactive Mentor for VOIP and found it to be FAR superior to this book, both in terms of general technical info and test preparation. I also recently picked up Integrating Voice and Data Networks (Cisco Press) and what I've read so far has convinced me that there is no reason on earth to buy this book anymore -- the long awaited ""good Cisco VOIP book(s)"" are here, and this is definitely not one of them.Aside from the IPv6 padding (which I also objected to), I also had a real problem with the author's writing style -- it was almost like someone just typed up some random notes. I can't understand what the 5 star reviewers are talking about ... this book is definitely NOT going to be a classic. My only hope is that there isn't a second edition.Save your money and buy the CIM or Cisco Press book."
4,Above Average Reference,"I'm really glad I picked this title up. No, it's not an all encompassing guru level text on VOip, but for us folks who have some idea of the technology, but want some further information, it's really good. I can understand many of these 3 or 4 star reviews but these 1 star reviews are, in my opinion, missing the strong parts of the book."
5,I've been waiting for this book.,This book does a great job of explaining how to actually plan and configure a voice-ip network. It manages to clearly explain some very complex topics and provides good examples and configuration scenarios.
3,Not Recommended!,The most problem I've faced with this phone That the Caller ID not working and if there is missed call there is no any singe about it! really its very weird! Any other Panasonic phone gonna be better.
1,Terrible telephone,"This seems like a nice idea, but Motorola's excution is terrible. The phones now have a battery life that can barely last one reasonabley long call. The sound quality is average, at best, and they drop calls willy-nilly. I would never have bought these phones knowing this, and I will be avoiding Motorola for a long time to come."
2,"Looks nice, lot of nice features, a couple issues that ruined it for me.","I'd have to agree with the jazz guy's review. There are some design flaws here. I did find out how to change the # of rings on the answering machine when I called the service line. You go to devices under menu and choose answer base, then there is an option to change it there.As stated above, there is no way to turn off or change the volume on the base ringer. This defeats the volume control on the handset.They state on the box that 15 ringtones can be used to identify incoming callers. This really means you can choose 1 ringtone for everyone in your phone book and another for everyone else. I expected to set a ringtone for each person. Not possible.Lastly, there is no speed dial. Just an option to choose from your phonebook which often takes more effort than dialing the number. For these reasons, I will be heading back to the store today to exchange. I should have stuck with Uniden. Had a great one for 5+ years."
2,Good phone for a While,This WAS a good phone for a while so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. It was clear and had good range. The intercom feature was nice. About 9 months after purchase though the screens on some of the handsets started to lose pixels. Eventually some screens were almost totaly blank and others were half blank. Then there was nothing to do but recycle the batteries and throw the rest in the garbage. I was very disappointed. Don't make the same mistake. I hope my new Panasonic system lasts longer than this one did.
2,Misrepresentation,"I bought this phone because my Uniden with ROOM MONITORING will no longer hold a charge, but the room monitoring and speakerphone and answering machine work fine. This Motorola does NOT have true room monitoring where you can call in remotely and hear what's going on in the room the phone is. The room monitoring they refer to means if you have more than one handset you can listen from one room to another, NOT THE SAME THING. When talking on the phone the clarity is very poor. Also the ""speakerphone"" is actually only handsfree on the handset, NOT the base which is also what I was looking for."
1,Poor quality battery life,"I do not recommend this phone. Bulky, hard to use, push a button here and there and it switches to spanish mode. god knows how to get it back to english. but most importantly, the battery life sucks. it dies really fast without warning. i bought a brand new battery too and after couples months it sucked it dry too."
4,Phone,This phone will not give the correct date and time from incoming messages. I set the time and everything by the book but it will not give the correct date and time for messages.
3,"Good Book, Wrong Title","Stott here does his usual exemplary job with the Scriptures he intends to unfold for us. His work is well-written, but has much more to do with Biblical models of church, gospel and ministry. There is very little real leadership content offered here. Perhaps the publisher altered the title a bit to make it more appealing in the Christian marketplace.The bottom line is that if you want Stott's opinions on church leadership, keep looking. This title isn't it."
5,"I don't really like yoga videos, but...","Honestly, I am kind of against yoga videos. I've never liked them, never practiced to them, and never connected to them. Until now. Oliver Reinsch is fun! This feels like taking a great yoga class in a studio, not like you're at home being motivated by a stranger. The speed is perfect. The music is soothing. The flow is designed to allow you to practice as intensively as you are feeling that day.What I also like about this practice is how inventive it is. Oliver does poses that aren't run-of-the-mill poses from your standard yoga practice. And it's an intuitive flow: just when you're thinking, ""Hey, I could really go for a twist right now"" - bam! Twist. He takes care of you, too, by stretching out your wrists and shoulders after working them.I can't recommend this video highly enough. I could practice to it each and every day, and get something new from it every time."
4,"Well planned, but fast moving","This is a very thorough and well thought-out yoga program. Even though this video is titled as a Core Power dvd (which it is) it does provide a good overall workout as well. My only hesitation is the speed with which he runs through the sun salutions in the middle of the workout. Due to a minor knee disability I cannot move through the sequence quite that fast, and I have never had this issue before with other dvds or in person classes. I typically can keep up, but for anyone with an injury, disability, or for someone new to the dvd and not quite sure what the next pose will be, it is rather fast moving."
5,great instructional dvd,"One of the clearest, easiest-to-follow, user-friendly instructional yoga dvds I've seen. I like the 3-level approach. I've given several of these dvds to yoga practicioner friends, and have received nothing but great feedback."
3,Okay,"I have bought quite a few yoga dvds in the last few months, and I bought this one after reading all of the good reviews.The video was good quality,the instructions clear, but that was not enough for me.The practice starts with some stretching on the floor.Personally, I like to start out with some sun salutations to warm my body as I practice first thing in the am.The sun salutations were about 15 minutes into the dvd.They didn't last long and at one point were a little faster than I would have liked.There didn't seem to be a good flow to the workout.Maybe this just wasn't my style.It wasn't as smooth and challenging as I would have liked.I consider myself an advanced beginner as I still have so much to learn.I wish that I could send this one back."
4,Very Good,"I would give this five stars - the guided instruction is easy to follow, and it is a good core workout. The only thing holding it back is that it is a little too easy. There are pose modifications being demonstrated by one of the other people on stage, but what is really needed are a few more sequences, and the inclusion of more challenging poses. I have only been doing yoga about a year, but I am athletic and was in good shape when I started. I still recommend this DVD, and keep it in rotation with several others."
3,Not for Beginners (Level 1),"I purchased this video from Amazon Instant Video - very good for someone who is experienced in Yoga. That said, the writeup indicates there are ""animated pose diagrams"" included. There exists no such diagrams (at least for the Instant Video version). Without knowledge of the various stretch positions beforehand, this becomes an exceedingly frustrating video to follow.1 star for Beginners, and (I'm being generous by guessing) 5 stars for advanced users. As such, I give it a 3-stars overall.Caveat Emptor"
3,"OK, but didn't rock me.","I got this dvd and it wasn't really what I thought it was going to be. I don't understand some reviewers who say it is a power yoga, it is not. There is one section that goes very fast but I didn't seem to build up 'heat', but that is me. Also, in spite of it being labelled 'Core Power', it is *not* a core-focused practice. Sadie Nardini's dvds WILL leave you gasping and humble you if you think that you have core strength, this practice will not. This is not a bad dvd, in fact the production values are head-and-shoulders above 99% of the other yoga dvds out there, but I just found it un-inspiring."
5,Great buy,This was a Christmas gift and my mother in law loves it. It has gotten great results and is popular in her medical community.
4,Novel approach,This program offers a newer approach to getting results in weight loss. It amps up your metabolism. It also does wonders for the waistline. Fast results too.
5,Love it!,I am so happy to have this item. It is the best work out I've ever had.It takes awhile to learn the routine but results are guaranteed afterward.
3,KNEE ALERT,Please start program slowly and with the okay of your doctor. Can cause significant knee pressure and discomfort. I've slightly modified my stance to decrease the pressure.
4,Harder than I thought!,"This T-Tapp workout is excellent and I feel myself getting stronger but it's a lot harder than it sounds. I'm sure if I keep on working, it will prove to be a healthy thing for me."
5,Best Gummies EVAR.,These gummies are so amazing juicy and tasteful. Your basically eating an orange when you chew these little heart gummies. They are great and i wouldn't pass having some of these up.
4,A Jr version of the adult game,"This game is simply Yahtzee in a Jr form. Instead of a bunch of number combinations, you have to match characters from Disney shows and movies. You have a wild die. The score card is simple pictures that you match cards to. Whomever has the highest points at the end, wins."
2,Shub-Niggurath - 'Testament' (Gazul/Musea),"One thing I'll say about this band is they've mastered their own original sound and style of free form experimental.Their heavy influences are drawn from King Crimson,Magma and Univers Zero.'Testament' has ten nemeless tracks.Unless you thoroughly enjoy some of the MOST 'out-there' experimental sorts of music,you may want to listen to some sound clips of this CD before purchasing a copy.I,personally know a few obscure music fans that may like it.Line-up:Jean Lue Herve-guitar,Alan Ballard-bass,Edward Perraud-drums and Veronique Verdier-trombone."
5,A must,"This a great book, one that I feel the adults will get the bigger kick out of. The book goes back and forth between reality and the imagination of our superheroes Bug Lady and American Eagle. It shows the innocence of childhood and the power of imagination. great book."
4,Much better than the original blade,"I like this blade much better than the original slicing blade that came with my machine. I hardly call this a ""thick slicing blade"", more like a medium blade. They should have packaged this one with the machine and sold the standard one as the ""thin slicing blade"".This does a much better job, but I could use a real thick blade as well. A quarter inch is hardly thick!"
1,"cheap, old, shabby",Why did I expect an old book in paper back that cost $.49 to be in better condition than the shabby condition it was? My bad for not knowing better!
1,Already Broken,"The second time I wore this brace, the rubber by the thumb broke. Without that piece, the whole thing is worthless."
2,Plastic latches don't hold well,"I wear wrist braces at night, and the closure latches on these often don't stay closed. Not very effective, if they don't stay on! Also, the adjustment strap did not stay tightly in place. I had to keep tightening it every few weeks.I tried wearing them for typing, but the rubber piece across the thumb rubbed and caused irritation; it also kept me from typing accurately.On a bright note, these are very open and your hands don't sweat.All in all, I would never buy these again. The store I bought them from didn't allow returns."
5,The only wrist brace for me,"I've tried about 10 different wrist braces over the years and this is the only one I like, and the only one I'll ever use from here on out (if I can help it). This one is easy to take on and off, pretty rugged, doesn't get stinky, doesn't apply pressure in the wrong places, and I like the black color over the ""nude"" colored ones."
5,Very Good Carpal Tunnel Brace,"I have had this brace for a few days as my carpral tunnal is coming back, approximately 10 years after surgury on both hands. Bad in the riht hand and minor in the left . I purchased a bunch of stuff in hopes of avoiding the knife again and this isby far the best investment . This brace works really welland is nice and light and really locks wrist movement. The only negative is it can get hot. But good ehjnough that I am going to order another one for my left had."
2,I don't recomend it for pc use.,"I bought it thinking I could use it for those long coding/gaming sessions, but no. It takes up way too much real estate in the palm of my hand. I unconsciously feel like taking it off after awhile of trying to use it with the pc. One more note, G9x mouse + this NO GOOD. I am sure this would be fine for other uses but this isn't some miracle worker for any person who -really- uses a computer (not you email/docs people). That is all."
1,New Age Phony Shamanism,"Please avoid this book by all means. I'm not sure how the author justifies this book as being a guide to the Vision Quest. There is NOTHING in this book that is even remotely similar to the Vision Quest Ceremomy of the American Indians. This is an insult and a rip-off of our spirituality.If you want to learn the true meaning behind the sacred ceremonies of the Lakota peoples, then I would most strongly recommend your read The Sacred Pipe: Black Elk's Account of the Seven Rites of the Oglala Sioux: Black Elk, Holy Man of the Oglala or Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux or Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux by Black Elk, John Gneisenau Neihardt, Vine, Jr. Deloria."
1,Stationary,I have not seen original publications of the authors in the medium- or even low impact scientific journals on the subject of the book. It is obviously a compilation of available to them scientific/technical papers. This area is well-developed and a number of books written by scientists developing this field many conferences proceedings are availbale I strongly recommend ignoring this compilation.
2,This Frame is of Poor Quality,"This frame looks beautiful online. When I got it, though, many of the glass pieces are not tall enough, leaving open gaps at the tops of the photos. Also, a couple pieces of glass were chipped. The frames themsleves are really pretty, so I am just going to get a few pieces of glass cut to match, but I definitley wouldn't buy these again, or anything from Bealls for that matter."
5,Greatest Fishing Band,"This CD collection is a lot of fun. I was looking for one song, ""The Bluegill Boogie"" came across the World's Greatest Fishing Band and decided to give it a try. Am glad that I did. It is a great collection of songs about fish and fishing. The band is very good. The songs are stories, all are worth listening to. I purchased the set for my dad, because my Papa is a fishing man; he and my mom loves it."
5,A must have for anyone who loves fishing and great music!,"When you first see the name ""World's Greatest Fishing Band"" you think this must be a gimmick until you put on the first CD and realize that not only is this NOT a gimmick, it's some of the greatest music that's been put out in quite sometime for people who love to fish and love music with a story and a purpose. I have now bought 5 of these CD sets for friends and relatives and I get the same feedback everytime, which is WOW! Nobody thinks this music could possibly be that good, but you have to hear it to believe it! It's fun, it's serious and it's the kind of stuff you can listen to around your family and definitely at your next shin dig or while your out fishing. One of my friends I gave this too swore he caught more fish when the played the CD's, just another in a long line of reason to get this album..."
1,poor imitation,I'm sorry but this is a poor imatation of a group that was the Dorados. what is with the Yanni type stuff. Sounds like the things already loaded in a keyboard when it comes from the factory
1,What happened!,"With a name like the worlds greatest fishing band you might think you would get a money back guarantee. This is the worst remake of the Dorados I hope to never here again. I bought this as a gift for my friend thinking it would be more of what I had by the dorados, please get some more of those back in stock. Very disappointed"
1,Be warned!,"This is a really lame blender. I got it to make smoothies... that's it! You'd think it'd be able to do that job with no problem. But it doesn't.The two chopping options don't really do the ice-crushing and smoothie-blending properly. You have to stop the thing and stir the ingredients around a couple times then restart it to get things blended. Even then it doesn't work as well as my old blender. Then, when you go to pour the contents into a glass, you get lots of messy spills, etc. because the spout is not designed very well.Overall: not great. Spend the $$ and get one that does the job."
3,"Not fancy, but useful","For someone who just wants to mix a shake or chop up some ice once in a while, this blender is an economic choice. I myself bought it just to have something to make my little banana shake and some other stuff, and it fulfills that purpose just fine. Three different speeds are satisfying for almost every mixing need. Granted, it doesn't have those fancy buttons like the other Cuisinart blenders, but hey, it also costs only half the price."
2,4 year old not interested - too basic,"My son is 49 months - he has already started pre-k and knows his basic letters - so this book was really booring for him and each page only had 2 activities -find the letter ....(only 2 letters per page) which were not very challenging. This book is bettered geared for infants who are just learning the letters as in the nursery - I think he would have been more interested then. I bought the Leap goes Shopping - which is delightfully interesting and challenging for him,it is multi-task, multi senosry and includes identifying in games - letters, shapes, colours, lots of sounds and noises. etc. We also got the Toy Story II which is a smashing hit with him - and it has challenges for him now until age 6 or so - per tuff stuff - but there are levels to choose.Therefore, I would recommend Leaps friends A-Z for infant beginners like 2 - 3 year olds but not for a 4 year old - too boring."
1,Not the best choice,My son received this book last year for christmas when he was four. He was bored with it right away. A year later he rarely places this book in his leap pad. Hoping that the next few books we purchase will be more intriguing to him.
1,Try another Leap Pad Book First,"My daughters have several Leap Pad Starter Books, this one is their least favorite. The only time they will even look at it, is if I have placed it into the LeapPad Book and started a game...the same, boring game for each letter of the alphabet. Go with the other books first. You aren't missing anything by not buying this book. Try Tad Goes Shopping or Birthday Surprise; these books will hold your child's attention a lot better."
5,Great,I used it when it was a video for many years and now as a DVD. I have achieved very good results for overall fitness.
5,EXCELLENT!,"There is really very few exercise tapes that are this good! Excellent stretch, great stomach workout. Worth every penny. I am so glad I found a copy of this tape!"
3,Be carreful it is not the original album,"What to say for those who remember the original vinyl album. The best version of little wings was in it. But not on this album, even others tracks are not the same.The original album was really better. Beside that this is Jimi Hendrix and it's a good compilation but not what we want."
1,This Is NOT Hendrix In The West,"I played the album to death in the 70s, especially Red House and the sequence was perfect. WHY they would mess with perfection and substitute different performances of Little Wing and Voodoo Child (Slight Retrurn) is a mystery and RIDICULOUS!! Who puts out the donkey doo doo anyway??? AVOID!!!"
5,Hendrix in the West,"One of Jimi Hendrix best performance!! Including the song ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearth Club Band""..a great Beatles classic! Great classic album!!"
3,Tight around the Platter,"Just like every other new release the CD was very tight around the platter. You have to bend the crap out of the CD just to get it off. When I finally got it off it was scratched to hell. Usually I can get the CDs off without scratching them but not this time. They need to quit making CDs like this. I'll just have to buy another copy, no big deal, its worth it too.On another note, the album is great despite there being previously released tracks on here. I also like the Amazon exclusive that came with the Winterland box set, I have not been able to hear a single bit of the box set yet though."
3,Not All Original Recordings,"I first bought this on vinyl in Germany in 1986 while I was stationed there in the Army. I couldn't believe it because it had been out of print in America for years. The best song on there was Little Wing, mistakenly listed as having been recorded at the San Diego Sports Arena but actually recorded at the Royal Albert Hall in London. this is the best live version of that song he ever did. The guitar playing on that, especially the ending is so emotional it almost brought tears. So when I heard it was finally being released I was overjoyed only to get it and find they have substituted the two Royal Albert Hall tracks, Little Wing and Voodoo Child (Slight Return) for two recorded elsewhere. Why? It completely ruins this set for me."
5,Hendrix in the west lp,What can you say about Hendrix. In the west is his best. Sounds even better on vinyl. Turn it up.
4,Hendrix still blows me away,"What a great CD! Not being a fan of live albums or CD's I purchased this with doubts.So glad I got it. There just isn't enough music from Jimi, and this piece will getregular rotation in my large music collection. The vocals are crystal clear. Alwaysliked Mitch Mitchell's drumming and it stands out here. Crisp and nothing wasted.The version of Red House is amazing. Finally some ""new"" Hendrix music for me."
3,Two of the Best Songs Swapped Out?,"I'm not sure I understand the enthusiasm about this release. With two of the best performances removed from the album, I feel misled about what I received. That version of ""Little Wing"" was one of my favorite tracks on the album. I won't be pre-ordering any more cds."
2,Where's 'Rock Around the Clock'?,"Hendrix doing 'Blue Suede Shoes', 'Johnny B Goode' and 'Sgt Pepper's...'?What's the point? I suppose it was considered ironic once, but it just seems like filler to me."
3,"""20th Century Foss""","I am a fan of Ernie's work and his film parodies. I enjoyed seeing ""Hardware Wars"" again and I wish the ""20th Century Foss"" studios would make and release more of his filmatic humor."
4,for my dad,I got this cushion for my dads wheelchair and he really likes it alot. He liked it so much thast he wants one for his chair at home.
2,One Dimensional Music,"Imagine someone held down a single note on a synthesiser keyboard. For an hour. That's what this ""music"" is like."
2,Ambience Minimus,"Packaging for this CD suggested the ambience would be mystical, magical and relaxing. The CD was totally disappointing. The sounds emitted were very barren, and there was no ""song"". The sounds that were audible were very pretty, but they were scarce."
5,Perfect deep relaxation,"I was so very glad when I heard this music. Finally there was something that could ease my tension and bring the peace of mind I have been looking for. The music on this cd is so simple and yet it just completely washes away the outside world. As for the inside world, my kids calm down and could anything be as beautiful as that? I really can't recommend this music enough. I am going to give a copy to everyone I know that has any tension in their life."
4,Superior Ambient/Atmospheric Music,"If you like TRUE ambient music with a hint of light space music, then this composition is a direct hit. No dark synthesizers, but a wonderful, floating melodious voyage in the clouds where breezes are calm and cool. If you're looking for a beat, you won't find it here. The music is designed to wind you down, not crank you up. Not a five star only because its four tracks are somewhat indistinguishable to an untrained ear like mine. A great addition to any collection that includes the likes of Serrie, Bowles, Geodesium, or Braheny. Relax and enjoy!"
4,Ambience Minimus - Liquid Mind (1),"I use this product for massage background music. All Liquid Mind Series work well for massage purposes. After purchasing the entire series, I realized you really only needed 1 or 2 of this style."
5,Great! Secure and quick access.,"I was a bit nervous about buying this as it seems the reviews were either great or horrible. But I wanted a solution for having quick, but secure access to a pistol. We have kids in the house and this is WELL worth the $200. Took about 2.5 hours to install (with a 3.5 yr old helping). Has worked great every time (had for 1 week now) and the beeping when opening isn't that loud or bothersome (didn't wake my kids when sleeping in next room). I've had no problems with the battery or fingerprint reader, though it did take a few minutes to learn to program it correclty. I will agree with another reviewer that you should program your print several times from slightly different positions to ensure it takes 'when you need it.' I'm VERY satisfied and the peace of mind is great (my wife is also very happy as well - one less thing to stress about)."
4,Generally works well but makes a lot of noise when opens.,"The vault generally works as advertized, but when opens makes more noise that any other vault I have tried. The noise consists from multiple loud electronic beeps and a hit when the door drops. Otherwise, if that wouldn't bother you, the vault works fine."
2,Not a do-it-yourselfer:,"Beautiful & very sleek; however, the wall opening for the safe must allow for several 1/4"" protruding pan head screws on each side, thereby necessitating a hole larger than the exterior box and/or flange; therefore, a professional installer will head-off most certain installation problems. Notice the cord to charge the internal battery is only 6' long; therefore to make re-charging most convenient, the safe will need to be precariously close to an electrical outlet, and the inevitable wire in the wall! Also, the finger print reader regularly requires 3 to 4 finger placements before the lock mechanism activates."
3,wall safe just okay!,"The biometric idea is great, but I think maybe it needs a little further development. When you try to use the fingerprint recognition it rarely works the first time and you usually need to try multiple times to get it to react, not a good thing if you need in during a panic. The door frequently gets stuck and jammed half way up when opening or closing. Kind of a neat product but definitely needs further refinement."
2,You can see through some of the cut cards,"In my order I received red, purple, and black cards. Problem is, you can see through the red and purple cards. The whole point of having a cut card is so you can't see the card on the bottom of the deck. So it's pretty much a complete fail. I'm giving it two stars because the black one worked."
3,Moster Challenged World/It! Terror from Beyond,"For Midnite Movies, these okay. Not super, and not expected to be super. It was best of the two in my opinion. Just okay - and no glitches in discs, which is IMPORTANT to me.Cecy Ivie"
3,Cheesy Sci-fi,"If you collect Cheesy 50's-60's sci-fi, this should be in your collection. Both are average for this genre. Neither is great. But IT, The Terror from Outer Space has Marshall Thompson in it. He always played his cheesy movie parts as though they were serious. These movies can be really rediculous, and fun at the same time. Kids love them, and when we were kids, WE loved them. Sure, they look cheesy now, but they bring back a time when life was easy, and movies were cheap entertainment. Pop some popcorn, and kick back to see what scared us when WE were kids. Simple fun."
3,Voice audio muffled on B-side movie,"I think both of these movies will satisfy the average sci-fi buff ... unquestionably ""It! The Terror From Beyond Space"" (B-side) is the better of the two for scariness and edge-of-your-seat suspense. However, I found the voice track to be quite muffled, making some of the dialog hard to discern. The music and sound effects (creature growls, moving about, objects moving within spacecraft, etc) are loud and clear but often drown out the voice/dialog in the movie, which is a bit aggravating. I cannot say for certain if this DVD ""recording flaw"" is common to all or just my copy?In regards to the A-side, ""Monster That Challenged The World"", the voice track is clear and discernible despite the music track being noticeably slightly louder."
4,"excellent 50s sci-fi, quite scary if clunky effects","These were two of the scariest films I saw as a kid, genuine late-night TV fun at sleepovers. I was totally engrossed in them, tho on re-viewing them I didn't quite feel the same as I did 40 years ago. While Monster is a pretty typcial, well, monster flick, it has lots of funny twists - mutunts (with radiation thorwn in), good heros, and a suspenseful plot. The one that really got me was IT, this mysterious alien that sneaks on a rocket. It duels with the crew, picking them off one by one: in many ways, it is almost the same film as Alien, but much scarier to me at the age I was if less slick. There are really wonderful films, with memories from my past. Thus, I wd recommend them for 50s nostalgia and xcellent on their own if you can get beyond the old-style effects."
3,The Monster that Challened the World/It! The Terror From Beyond Space,"Two other, fun, silly horror movies where the horror winds up making you chuckle! Enjoy the arcane 1950s special effects, folks."
3,Seen better,I watched it once. That's it. Can't win them all. Just not very good. Just file this one away under nice try.
3,For A Saturday Afternoon,"Both of these films are ""B"" or ""C"" films.Of course both stories have absurd plot points (e.g. It! -- To try and kill the monster they shoot pistols, and rifles, and rockets at it -- inside the space ship!), but the films are okay for a lazy Saturday afternoon."
4,Great double feature of B movie monsters,"The Monster that Challenged the World is some kind of giant mollusk creature , maybe a big caterpillar or something that kills people (some deaths are pretty shocking for its time) theres a little gore and radioactive goop that the characters keep seeing. The effects arent bad, it is a low budget but lots of fun to sit back and watchIt the Terror from Beyond Space is an entertaining B movie about monster that is on a spaceship returning to Earth and kills people, some chilling scenes. This movie inspired Alien and the monster was played by Ray Corrigan. Really a lot of low budget entertainment in both films. They are short and just a good way to escape for a little while. I highly recommend this to anyone into 50s B movies - these are above average.MGM put out some very stunning transfers as well..."
3,Escargot getting its revenge,"Double-sided disc featuring two monster-type sci-fi oldies. Side A features The Monster that Challenged the World(84mins/1957). This movie has French & Spanish subtitles and is presented in full screen. Giant snail-like creatures invade Catalina Island! What will the military do to stop them?Side B features IT! The Terror from Beyond Space(69mins/1958). This movie also contains French & Spanish subtitles as well as the original theatrical trailer with some ""subliminal messages"" and is presented in full screen . A mission to Mars is distrupted by an 'IT' thing. Will they ever make it to Mars on time?Between the two movies I enjoyed 'Monster' a lot more. The pace was quicker and I could get into the characters. 'IT!' felt a little dull for me. The spaceship setting wasn't as appealing and the characters weren't that interesting. Also, the creature from 'Monster' is 'better' looking..just my opinion. Both prints are clear. Old 50's style drive-in terror."
4,the monsterthat ate the world,"i remember this movie when i was a kid the it , was one monster that scared me"
4,Read this before you buy!,"My girls really enjoy doing this ""dance class"". My only real complaint is that I'm disappointed that I didn't order the ""Dancing for Kids (Baby Ballet / Tot Tap / Junior Jazz)"" DVD instead. It looks like that video includes this baby ballet dance class as well as a Tap dancing class and a Jazz class, so it would have been better value. It also would have been nice to have a bit of diversity."
1,Too advanced for little girls,"I was looking for a DVD that would give more detailed instruction. In watching this with my almost 3 year old, I had trouble keeping up. It moved too fast from one move to the next. It assumed you had prior instruction. I was looking for something with more instruction, more fun and less assumptions & less boring. My 3 year old walked away to play in her kitchen. Not worth the purchase unless there is prior knowledge."
3,Very dry to watch for toddler,"My 2.5 y/o daughter loves to dance around the house and is a very bright little thing. She loves to dance to Dancing with the Stars, so I thought this DVD would be perfect for her. Well, unless I really get up and do it with her and do lots of coaxing, she's totally bored. The instructor on this DVD has absolutely no personality. I realize these are ballet drills, but come on, lighten up a little, these are kids. This would probably be better for a kid who is already in a ballet class and needs practice at home. But just for the fun of doing ballet, I would look for something else. I got her one the Yoga Kids dvd, and the instructor makes it fun, so my daughter runs over to the tv to do the yoga very excitedly. I think when you made a dvd for kids, especially one called ""Baby Ballet,"" there should be some effort to actually engage them. This ballet video is a major yawn."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I expected this to be fluff. It's not. My 3 daughters ages 5, 5, & 7 take regular lessons and love to practice their positions with this DVD."
2,We need better quality dvds for children,The children are cute but the quality (cinematography) of the dvd is low and the class is not very inspiring.Caterina & Her Baby Ballerinas
2,Very serious,"We were looking for something a little more fun than this video. This is a very serious ballet lesson. If that's what you are looking for, you will love it. We were looking for something a little less formal and more fun."
2,"Low budget production, assumes some previous knowledge.","The makers of this film appear to have put a video camera on a tripod in the corner of a rec center ballet class. The filming is static, and not particularly interesting.Some of the moves are never really demonstrated or described, which was frustrating for my little girl. The instructor just shouts out a ballet term, and everyone in the video starts doing it.We do lots of instructional videos: yoga, tumbling, and other types of dancing. This is her least favorite even though she loves to pretend to do ballet."
2,For much older children!,"I bought this thinking ""baby"" ballet would be a beginning class. However, the instructor goes very fast, doesn't explain anything and the steps are far too complicated for young children. Would recommend for at least 7 year olds."
4,Not really for Babies! LOL,"I bought this for my 19 month old. She mimics some of the movements, but it only holds her attention for about three minutes. I think she will enjoy it when she is closer to three years old or even older. It is a good DVD for older girls though."
3,Not baby ballet,"This is a great tape for an older child, but my daughter is 3 and a lot of the steps and moves are to difficult for her level. However, she does have a lot of fun tring to do the moves. So if you are purchasing this tape for your childs enjoyment it is a good tape, but I wouldn't expect many children under 4 or 5 to master the steps."
1,Boring Ballet,"My 3-year-old is ballet crazy, but this DVD completely bored her. She left after about 5 minutes. It is so poorly produced, it looks like a bad home video - bad lighting, really boring message, etc. It moves very slowly, not much action or pacing, so it just bores the kids. Sadly, there are not a lot of other options out there, but this is not worth your money."
2,Very boring,"The description says that it is fun. It is the opposite of fun! Very boring for adults and children. Also, like another reviewer said, it's very much like a home video. I'm really stuck trying to find a video for my twin girls that is fun, educational and appealing. There are plenty to choose from, I just don't know which one :("
2,Not Age Appropriate,"I bought this for my toddler, since it's called ""Baby Ballet."" It's not at all age-appropriate for her. We went ahead and kept it, because it's great for my ten year-old, but that's not what I was looking for."
4,Great Present for Teenage Brother,"This Gong is very nice, and my little brother, who collects these sort of things was, glad to receive it. I didn't really pay attention to the dimensions when I bought it, and was quite surprised at how tiny it is irl. But my brother was pleased, so I was pleased overall."
2,AMAZON.COM HASN'T NOTICED THAT I ALREADY REVIEWED THIS,"HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL READ THIS BEFORE POSTING AND THERE NOT POST ITNot a good serial...read my more detailed review. I'm just writing this to clear it off the list of items they don't think I've reviewed."
3,Warning,Warning - only 6 men come with a set. Imagine my surprise... Geez. They're good otherwise...
2,NOT a set!,"DESCRIPTION SAYS SET. ONLY 6 MEN, 13 ON TABLE. WOULD HAVE JUST ORDERED MORE IF WOULD HAVE KNOW. NOW I GET TO PAY SHIPPING TWICE..TABLE NOT READY FOR PARTY."
3,Tha best man to do the job,"I will agree with a few anti-ice fans that this album is not his greatest hits ever,Why? cause he is bussy with his greatest hits on his albums from Hard to Swallow to Bi pollar.When Ice starded out in 1991 he had a manager that played him like a puppet that is where this album is comming from.Now Ice is on his own and is creating the best songs i have ever heard-he is doining it his way now.Alot of people will not enjoy this album, but it all started with the songs on this album."
1,A Vanilla Ice greatest hits cd.This is a joke right.,"The best of?Didn't this fool have only one hit?To release a Vanilla Ice greatest hits cd is just a pure joke.Who in their right mind would enjoy this junk?This album is such a joke,it makes Limp Bizkit's ""New Old Songs"" look like a classic.Now that is sad.Don't waste your sweet cash on this.Word 2 ya mutha"
1,"If you have dignity,you will not buy this record.","Vanilla Ice is the worst rapper in the game.He has given rap music,and the whole music industry,a bad name.His 15 minutes of fame ended a long time ago.He made it big with one hit,the incredibly awful ""Ice Ice Baby"".After that,no one was interested anymore.Now,he's trying to sing in the rock world,in the form of rap-metal.But any true rock fan would be smart enough to avoid any of his ""metal"" albums.But back to his hits.Like I said before,he had only one hit and nothing else.By the way,anyone who actually listens to this ""music"",I'm not protesting you for listening to this,but I just think this is bad.Peace"
5,most breathe taking performance ever,"if you ever want to see a performer bear his soul to millions of people through the art of song, i suggest you listen to one of the greatest works of art ever created by a single man... NINJA RAP! this song should be your lone reason for purchasing this album. if you want to hear a song that will not only touch your heart, but the deepest reaches of your soul, ninja rap is the song for you. only the most cold hearted people in the world can listen to this song and not cry."
2,"Vanilla Ice, Ice Baby","My son also wanted this one, because he heard the song Ice, Ice Baby. Let's go waaay back! But there were too many songs that had bad language for us to want him to hear, so we sent it back."
5,bandaberte,"this album was originally released in 1979 and was called ""bandaberte"". It is a well produced album and is probably one of the best italian recordings ever. It had a great impact on the italian market eventhough Loredana was (and is) not very accepted in Italy, due to her ""rough"" lyrics and rebellious behaviour in public. ""la luna busso"" is a kind of reggea/pop blend which hints at 10cc's ""dreadlock holiday"". Great stuff."
4,Awesome Game for Yu Yu Hakusho fans,If you like Yu Yu Hakusho you will love this fighter game. It is the only Yu Yu Hakusho game that came out for a console. It is a lot of fun and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
2,Limited information,"The cover of this book says ""How to identify helpful, harmful, and venomous insects"" but only about half of the insects in the book have an illustration. Many of the insects are common species that most folks can already identify from experience (house flies, mosquitos, fleas, centipedes, millipedes, house crickets, etc.) It may be useful for children, but as I mentioned, there are limited illustrations (and they are not in color). If you are looking for something along the lines of a key to identifying insects, this book will not help you."
3,No identifying photos,"Ordered because I live in the Tucson area where this was written and familiar with many of the insects, but no photos, especially no color plates for identifying insects. Good info, but hard to know which is what??????????"
4,Bendis does it again,"Total Sell Out is basically just a collection of short strips/stories that Bendis has done over the years. Some are crime fiction (naturally) and others are just hysterical.When I read ""My Blue Heaven,"" I just about fell out of my chair, and the Shtick section is definitely worth a laugh.By far, the gem of the book, and the funniest, is the story about Kabukiman. I won't spoil it--but it's so indicative of the state of comic book conventions.""Better Living Through Chemistry"" and ""The Kiss Off"" are superb pieces of crime fiction that feature Bendis on art. I wish this guy would pick his pencil back up!All in all, a very entertaining read. At the very least, it's a great book for bathroom reading, if you're into that kind of thing."
5,Lighten up and read this book!,"If you've dreamed of being famous and have wanted a glimpse into the world of the rich, pampered and admired, this book is for you. Karen and Melissa expose the shallow, much-hyped world of celebrities and ""it"" girls in an entertaining, hilarious book. The authors offer over-the-top suggestions for getting noticed, yet some tips are realistic and helpful. It was a nice break from the serious, non-fiction books I normally read and the intense, best-selling novels I normally buy. Add some spice to your life and read this book!"
2,"Entertaining in a ""Jerry Springer"" /AnnaNicoleSmith way","This over-the-top memoir of the glamorous slash grueling experiences of two narcissistic women left me satisfied as a reader. While I felt my stomach curl at passages describing how they sent fancy invitations to A-listers while sending el cheapo e-vites to their close friends, I still managed to enjoy reading about it, similar to the way I like watching Anna Nicole Smith make a complete idiot of herself on national television."
1,Don't bother,"Once upon a time my daughter wanted to become famous. Needless to say, this was NOT the book to get as a guide. Totally useless and used it as burning material for our fireplace."
1,What a load of nonsense,"What garbage. Save your money. Don't even bother browsing through it at the bookstore. Whoever said in an earlier review that all the five star ratings were written by the authors themselves is spot on; the book is not clever, insightful, or even tongue-in-cheek cute. What's more these ladies are not glamorous, famous or even beautiful -- just desperate. If you're really dying to get on Page Six (yechh!) all you need to do is steal a celebrity's shoes or underwear . . . or worse (just ask Andrew Cunanan). So a couple of haggish, self-aggrandizing neurotics got to wear some nice jewelry and get written about in the newspaper? Who cares?"
3,True Confessions from a co-author,"My true confession is that I have not read this book; however, I saw Melissa on television talking about it. She stated that one of the things she did was give the book an effusive review right here on Amazon. I appreciated her honesty. It confirmed my suspicions regarding a lot of the book and music reviews here.An amusing lady. Look to the other reviewers for opinions on the book and be a little wary of five star reviews."
1,Neurotic Wannabe Drivel,"Don't waste your time or money reading this book. The positive reviews were clearly written by their friends - or themselves. The book reminds me of going on a blind date with someone who is so self involved you start seeing Charlie Brown's teacher making that ""harr heer heer hoar haar"" noise as their mouth opens and closes.When these women aren't boring you by dropping names, they're giving advice on how to become a neurotic socialite wannabe. Unfortunately, they seem to strive to be just such a person with such vigor they don't notice how desperate and pathetic they really are. A sad insight to desperate women who place too much value in everthing that doesn't matter."
2,Silly and shallow,"This book is trying to sell itself as more than it is. This is not entertaining and useful hints and tips on what ordinary Americans can do to ckaim some fame. It is simply a description on how two over-the-hill journalists in their 30s used their old sources to get invited to celebrity parties -for two weeks. (going to these parties is basically in the job desciption for journalists anyway.) The book is fun at times, but on the whole it is repetitive and self absorbed. Not worth the buy."
1,read first don't make the mistake I made,Warning warning not eye of the tiger survivor just a band claming to be the first with the name waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,my only real objection...,"I enjoyed this because although the gimmick is old hat and the acting is just servicable, I just have a thing for spooky, atmospheric movies taking place in lonely, decaying locations. The classic, for me, is Session 9. This is not in that ballpark but I watched this a couple years ago after first buying it and it has stuck with me. Watching it again as I type this, my only real objection is the shot-on-video look--I`ve just never been a fan of it. But this whole genre is basically one of variations, with the only original ingredients being the locations and the quality of the atmosphere. I can`t defend this as a great movie, but I believe the makers sincerely tried to create something moody, and they succeeded."
4,Dark and Effective,"Head Trauma is not the typical thriller/horror flick from this or the past decade. Thats because it actually IS creepy. The story is a more than welcomed break from the run of the mill PG-13 craptastic horror flicks produced for the bubblegum chompin' junior high crowd.While the acting isn't oscar-worthy, the photography and lighting make up for it and deliver genuine chills somewhat similar to recent J-horror and classics of 70s and 80s.Not the scariest, but definitely worth checking out."
1,Live and Learn,"I completely agree with the last review!!! I bought this after reading all the WONDERFUL reviews and what a mistake that turned out to be. WHAT haunted house??? This was terrible. If you want a true haunted house story try a few of these and then you can say you watched a ""haunted"" house movie: Legend of Hell House, Haunted, The Haunting (1963)."
3,Tasty Granola,The granola itself is very tasty and I like the idea of lower fat. Only problem is the raisins are way too hard. They don't add anything to flavor and someone could chip/break a tooth if not careful. Take the raisins out and it would be great.
2,Good taste but hard bits dangerous to teeth.,I really wish I could say I loved this as it does taste good. the hard fruit bits just make it a danger to your teeth! I should have listened to the earlier review!!!
4,"Low fat yet, great flavor",I am a mixer at heart. I love my oatmeal every morningwith a hearty measure of Familia granola tossed in.Very tasty
3,Michael Grant phones it in on this one,"This book covers the Severan Dynasty, which was pivotal to the fate of the Roman Empire, however it is really brief and seems mostly composed of passages from other books Michael Grant wrote. If you want a better narrative history of the Severans, check out George C. Brauer's more pedestrian, if much more accessible The Decadent Emperors. The problem with this period is that the most complete source, the Historia Augusta (part of which has been published as Penguin'sLIVES OF THE LATER CAESARSas a kind of sequel to Suetonius) is badly flawed and completely unreliable, so this leaves us Cassius Dio, Herodian and a few other authors. I respect Michael Grant and was sorry to hear of his death, but this book comes across to this reader like Mr. Grant was ""phoning it in."" The sequel to this,Collapse and Recovery of the Roman Empiresuffers the same problem, however the predecessor,The Antonines: The Roman Empire in Transitionis worth a read, as most of his books are."
5,Great fun for kids,My 2 year old has a lot of fun carting around his toys and such. It is very well built.
5,Good quality and our 4 year old loves it.,"Easy to put together, slightly smaller than I anticipated but it works for our 4 year old. It's very sturdy and he likes the fact it looks like an adult sized one. A great buy."
4,Great gift,"I like this wheelbarrow because it is an open- ended toy (no directions for use, it's up to the child's imagination).I ordered it because I had recently purchased the Radio Flyer tricycle and was impressed with the simplicity of design and quality of construction. The wheelbarrow is equally durable with one exception: plastic tire instead of rubber like the tricycle. Since this is a toy to be used outdoors, I hope the plastic tire will not be a problem."
4,adorable,really cute- i used to work at a store that sold them. easy to assemble and kid friendly. fun even if used as a decoration
5,Great buy,We got this for Christmas for our 4 year old twins who love to help their dad with yardwork. It was simple to put together and very sturdy and durable as all of the Radio Flyer products have been. It is still an inside toy now until the weather is warmer. They are enjoying putting their toys in it now and carting them around the house. Definitely a good buy that we are very happy with.
2,misleading,"this isnt large enough to put anyhting more than a cantaloupe in...the handles aae 8"" off the floor....what a huge mistake!"
4,Solid 'barrow,"A bit small on the depth of the bucket, but my kids like it. Remember, to use this equals working, so your child may lose interest (even if you are using your full size wheelbarrow at the same time!) hard plastic tire works best on grass."
4,Daughter loves it.....,I at first had bought this for my 4 1/2 year old son but when he proved to be to tall for it we gave it to our 21 month old daughter. She loves it because she now has a wheelbarrow to use. We ended up buying my son a bigger wheelbarrow that was good for his age.
4,Nice - but should have a better tire,My son really enjoys this wheelbarrow. I do however wish that it had a rubber tire instead of the plastic molded tire.
2,Wheelbarrow,"This review is not fully about the actual products quality, but more that my son (3 1/2 years old) has not been playing it with it as much as I had anticipated. We bought it for xmas along with some rakes, brooms, etc for pretend play and he just does not use the wheelbarrel at all. It is a bit hard for him to balance and so he is using it now just to play car races and building legos. He is a very active, coordinated boy so it is not that he doesnt know how to use it- I think it needs more stability, at least another wheel possibly or maybe as he gets older he may develop more of an interest."
5,Daddy's Little Helper,This wheelbarrow was purchased for Christmas. It's presently being used in the Playroom and can't wait to go outside to help Daddy. It is an exact copy of his father's and made as well. A perfect gift with a child who has a backyard.
4,"fun tool and toy, but it is made in China","Very nice wheelbarrow as others have already reviewed...pretty red, sturdy, proper height for tall boy (maybe up to ~4-5 year old). You do need to assemble it...be ready for some work and make sure you have adjustable wrench for fastening the screws...but assembly is very easy. I was somewhat disappointed to find out that this product is made in China...RadioFlyer website is all about the history of how the first red wagons were made in USA...this is misleading. I might have chosen another product if I had know this...OneStepAhead has very nice plastic wheelbarrow made in Germany."
5,Great toy,I got this for my 3 y/o as she loves to help me around the garden. She has had great fun filling it with dirt and pushing it around.Very robust and should last for years.
2,"Good, but not great","Two grandsons and one granddaughter LOVED this wheelbarrow, which was purchased to replace a 20+ year old radio flyer kid's wheelbarrow that finally wore out - on the new one the gauge of the metal is thinner, the paint wasn't applied as nicely and within 6 years it had deteriorated and begun to rust.These issues are NOT the fault of the seller - just keep in mind, like most things manufactured now, the quality and construction is sometimes not as good as what was made previously. If I were to buy this again I'd make sure it was kept indoors and always stored clean and dry (try to get a 5 year old to do that all the time!)"
3,wheelbarrow,"The wheelbarrow was cute, not as big as I was expecting, for the price, but I filled it full with candy instead of what i was planning, and you should have seen my grandsons eyes pop when he saw it, priceless.."
5,Great Value For Quality Product,"The item arrived much quicker than anticipated, and arrived in perfect comdition. The item itself is an ideal gift for the little farmer anywhere. Assembly wqs a breeze and the study construction of the item give assurance that it's going to last for a very lolng time. This is a great deal for a Radio Flyer item, so I highly suggest you pick this up if you know a little one who would enjoy it."
4,Good low-tech fun,"We bought this for our 18 month old son and it was a perfect fit. He likes to compare it with our big wheelbarrow, and to roll it around our backyard...I am amazed at how good he is at manoeuvering it around our lumpy, bumpy backyard - I think it is very good for his motor skills and for thinking about how to get from here to there - I've seen him problem solve with it. I recommend it for boys and girls who like to haul things around...indoors he uses his grocery cart for his animals, outside it is it this wheelbarrow for his tools."
4,Great Buy,"This is so much better than the plastic wheelbarrows. My son has it all - toy blowers, weadeaters, mowers, etc. and this is his favorite because it actually looks just like daddy's! He hauls dirt, flowers, and of course, toys everywhere. We have had this since Christmas and it has lasted well."
2,Missing parts,"This was a gift for my nephew, and since I could not attend his 4th birthday I sent him this. I was so sad, when I found out that it was missing 6 screws, and he was unable to put it together on the day of his birthday. :("
2,$14.95 for such a tiny book?,"Joseph Pennell's account of his 3-day tandem bicycle pilgrimage from London to Canterbury is interesting for his description of a very few characters he met along the way, but lacking in other respects. Why did he undertake this journey? How did he plan for it? It really isn't explained. I do not get any feel for the experience he had. The entire book is only 19 pages. Another 6 pages relate the story of St. Thomas. Skip it and try Jerry Ellis' far more substantial and better written 'Walking to Canterbury'."
3,"Aircraft Systems: Mechanical, Electrical and Avionics Subsystems Integration (Aerospace Series (PEP))","Good information but needs more graphics and coloured diagrams to explain valves, systems operation. It seems publisher is saving money with black & white pictures and graphics."
1,Never Received Order,This was delivered to the wrong address and I never received it. Paid for something I never got!
1,Metal water bottle,"Three large bottles are being returned because they are too long to fit in my bike and too heavy to carry to the gym when full of water, I am using the smaller bottles and have almost gotten rid of the metal taste. They do keep water colder."
1,"This product stinks,,, literally and makes water taste even worse.... don't buy it","Furthermore.... I bought two of this type thing trying to get away from plastic..... they took forever to get to me and I have tried everything I can to get the nasty taste out of them... Nothing works, so I have written a few times to Amazon,,,totally ignored .... I want to return them.. I have only had them a couple of weeks,,, ignored... maybe Bazo's sold Amazon, maybe we need to stop buying from Amazon with this kind of lack of service?? But this product is nasty awful.... don't buy it!!!!!"
2,Nice bottle; spare the dents please,Water bottle is very nice. Sturdy and light. Unfortunately it arrived with several small but very noticeable dents in the side. We were not impressed when we opened the box.
1,WARNING! The internal liner peels Off!!!,"After less than a year the internal liner has peeled of completely!! This is an awful product.SIGG spends a lot of money on marketing, but very little on doing a product that is actualy safe."
3,"Great water bottle, but not the color shown","I received a 1.0 liter Sigg water bottle, but the color was different than the ""Reflex Blue"" shown on the web site. What I received was a very dark blue/purple color. I used to own a Reflex Blue Sigg bottle, so I know that color exists, but that's not what I got."
5,Simplistic and great cap!,"I own a couple of Sigg bottles, noticed that the cap us different for this one, as in the screw. This screw cap is easier to screw on, and the glossy dark grey color is nice. Most importantly, the color is true blue simplistic!"
1,Do not buy SIGG,"I bought this water bottle a few months back and about a week in the lining on the inside of the mouth started to peel. I contacted their customer support and they said they would replace it, but I had to ship it to them out of my own pocket. They gave me an RMA number and everything so it seemed to be going fine.It has been about two months now and they are ignoring every effort I make to contact them via email, phone, etc.. I have sent emails to several different addresses of theirs and still no response, still no water bottle. Absolutely terrible customer support and who knows if I can every get my water bottle replaced."
4,"Sigg Traveler Classic Water Bottle (.6 liters, silver)","I like this bottle a lot--it's the right size for me, keeps liquids cold for longer than the nalgene bottles and is convenient to carry. It's small opening means that it is not as easy to fill and the screw top is more difficult to open than competitor styles. But, all in all, I think the Sigg bottles are the best on the market."
5,Sigg water bottle,"first: this bottle is not frail and does NOT dent very easily. i have one dent in mine, but this is from a very heavy slam of the locker upon it, and the dent is not even large. Second: this bottle looks good and is a definite conversation piece. but try to avoid the silver colors; it will look like you're drinking out of a pipe. Last: These are superior to plastic water bottle: you dont taste plastic, and you dont feel like a jerk for piling the landfills with your plastic. Additionally, DO get the special brush. you will want to clean it occasionally, and this brush does a darn good job. and for the record, i have only used this bottle for water, not juice or anything."
2,Threads can't be cleaned,"The top uses very fine threads that can't be cleaned. After 10 minutes with a tooth brush there is still gunk in the threads. I think it gets forced into the deep ""V"" in the thread when you close the cap. Better bottles use larger shallow round bottom threads. Also the plastic coating is, well plastic. They do look nice and hold up to abuse. And I don't think the gunk in the threads will kill you because you can turn it into sterile gunk if you soak it in bleach. But it looks bad even at arm's length I can see it."
2,Not up to expectations,"I bought this product to replace an old Sigg water bottle I have been using for the past 5 years. Seeing as how much I liked my other one, I figured ""Why switch?"" Loved this bottle the first day, and then the second, but on the third the inside lining started peeling off. And let me tell you there is nothing worse than taking a drink from your water bottle only to end up with some little rubber pieces floating around your mouth. Im back to using my old bottle... I would have only given it one star, but it is still a damn good lookin bottle and I cant bring myself to throw it away."
4,"good, but dents easily","I decided to go with a metal bottle because i wouldn't have to worry about plastic chemicals getting into the water. It's a pretty convenient size, holds a good amount of water. Only complaint is the metal dents very easily. They could have put a protective plastic layer on the outside or something to make it more durable, especially seeing as it cost $20. Apart from that it's a good bottle as long as you don't care about a few dents."
4,Great bottle!,"After deciding to replace our Nalgene bottles, I researched metal bottles from various manufacturers. Sigg bottles consistently scored high in reliablility and satisfaction, so we bought a few of them. My only nit is that the lids are easy to drop and maybe lose, so an included lanyard would be nice. But aside from that minor complaint, the bottles are light, odor/taste-less, and dead sexy, to quote someone famous!"
4,"Great Bottle, Hard to fill","I love the look of my three new SIGG bottles! They are very cool. Only problem is that it is hard for me to fill them with water if I use my fridge water. I have to use my finger squeezed behind the bottle neck to push up the little trigger to get the water to come out. Fridge's fault, not the bottle. On a regular fridge you just push the cup in and the water comes out, but on ours you have to push the cup in and up to release the water. I think we have a TRIO Kenmore. Ice cubes also need to be rinsed for a sec before they will fit in."
2,Not Fit For Battle,"I returned this bottle because it was all dinged up and scratched. Honestly, it looked like it had been through Iraq before it got to me in LA. I didn't reorder because it seemed like it would damage easily, and for over $20 I think it should stand up to a little abuse. I've been washing and reusing a glass bottle that one of those fancy, sugary teas come in. It's just as good if not better for for the environment."
1,NOT durable,"I bought two of these water bottles at a retail store several years ago. The bottle caps were broken within a few months. We continues to use them though just with the pull-top, however, both bottles show major wear and tear in the form of dings and dents. I wouldn't recommend these."
2,just buy a plastic bottle,"Bought this thinking it would be sturdy. Boy, was I wrong. Dents VERY easily. Better off just buying a cheaper plastic bottle."
1,Horrible bottle cap!,I only gave this water bottle one star because if you can't drink easily from it-why have it? This screw off style cap is cumbersome and takes a total of SEVEN turns to get the cap off. Who has the time or patience when looking for a quick drink? I looked online to purchase another style cap but also found problem reviews for the other style caps. Save the $25 and look elsewhere.
5,Never buy bottled water again!,"I bought this for my waterholic son for his birthday (at his suggestion). It seems a bit expensive but once you get it, you realize why. It is both lightweight and sturdy. I think I'll be buying 3 more for the rest of my family members as we are all constantly carrying around a bottle of water-to the gym, in the car, in the yard. A practical yet much appreciated gift!"
1,Lining inside bottle,"After I bought the bottle, the lining started peeling and from what I understand the lining is more dangerous and so the whole purpose of the safe bottle is lost. Stay away from this company and brand."
3,fungus prone cap,"The only issue I have with this bottle is the funky smell it develops in the cap area and I had to stop using it. I've never had such issues with the other bottle I have now (since: 2-3 months). I generally use it for my protein shake and I clean up the bottle right after I finish it and leave it to dry for 24 hrs. I'm not really a fan of the screw top either, annoying to open and it's almost impossible to open it one handed (say, while biking/climbing)."
3,It's ok - but the paint chips,"I purchased this from a store near my house. The design is really nice, and it keeps water cold for quite some time. But after 2 weeks, I accidentally dropped it, and the paint started to chip. I wasn't really expecting it to dent so easily or the paint to chip so easily, despite my carelessness. If I were to purchase another SIGG, I'd purchase a stainless steel one (no colors) to keep it looking new."
1,broken after a year,I loved my sigg water bottle but the lid won't stay on tight anymore - the grooves are all worn down where you twist the cap on and water leaks out. I thought they would last more than a year. Bummer.
3,It holds water but it isn't very durable,"Pretty thin walls on this container; I have bumped it a couple of times, dropped it one or two times and looks like I threw it off a tall building. It's like it's made out of wax, if you bump it or drop it, your ""accidents"" will show. It's the Dorian Gray's picture of metal water bottles."
4,good bottle,"im happy...but i dont know if its worth the price. nalgene bottles are much cheaper. If you have the extra dough, go for it...its the best around"
5,Very dependable,"I have one of these that is 21 years old now. Dented, scratched, and still perfectly functional. If you want a water bottle that will last more than a summer or a sports season then this is what to get."
4,Great Product Arrived in Terrible Condition,"I would give this produce 5 stars because I think that if I had ordered directly from Sigg it would have been worth it. Instead, I ordered from Online Fitness and it arrived in terrible condition. There were white streaks and scratches all over it, despite it being advertised as ""new."" I gave Online Fitness a poor rating because of their apparent lack of quality control and they had the nerve to send me 2 emails requesting that I remove my negative feedback (which I didn't)....ARGH! Anyway, this product would have been perfect if it had arrived looking like it wasn't fished out of a recycling bin."
3,stitch pattern,Looks great but the stitch pattern across the head where the fabric comes together isn't cylindrical and makes it fit a little funny unless you pull it really tight. The fabric is a nice material.
3,Too small for people with large heads.,"Good looking product, but to small for people with large heads. I take over a 7 and 3/4 fitted hat to fit my head."
3,The leads work well but the picture is misleading,"I should have read the description more carefully and not just the illustration. When I ordered this connection kit I was expecting some kind of simple docking device for the iPod into which the leads connected, using the line-out connection from the docking connector. But the kit contains just standard jack-to-phono leads which plug into the headphone socket, the docking unit shown in the picture is not included. That said, they work fine and for the price I'm not complaining. To get an appropriate level of signal to your stereo system you will probably need to increase the volume limit settings of the iPod - this will increase the maximum sound level in the earphones also."
3,Missing items,"I just received my camera yesterday and had the same problem as Richard. Camera seems to work fine, but now I have to go out and purchase all the missing items. Especially some rechargeable batteries and a charger. With regular AA batteries, I was out of power within 30 minutes. I really hope the rechargeables last a little longer."
4,Fjui E550,"By and large it is a good camera. There is one thing it won't do (refurbished) and that is manually focus, but since I almost never to that any way I am not sending it back for another."
1,Get what you pay for?,I too am missing the usb adapter as well as the hand strap & cradle. I cannot down load my images to my computer and burn through batteries in less than one day. I can't find replacement parts anywhere on the web or in stores to make my camera functional. I am so disappointed with this purchase. My local drug store can't down load the XD card and I will have to go to a store in another town just to empty the card and burn it to a CD. Don't even think of buying a fuji product as they won't help me either.
2,Gave it two chances,I was very happy with this camera the first time I bought it at full price. Then after about a year the lcd screen went crazy. I thought it might have just worn out so when I saw the remanufactured one at a great price I bought one. Unfortunately after a few months the screen on this one went also. Stay away from this model.
4,Fuji camera,"I have enjoyed it and think I was really smart to find it refurbished on Amazon. Instead of paying $377.00 for it, I got it for $111.00. Works great and I like the software that comes with it."
1,Missing batteries.,"I am also missing the batteries and the charger. I tried regular AA batteries, but they die really quickly, and when they die, the lens doesn't retract. I have a feeling it is false advertizing on Fujifilm's part, not Amazon's because other sites list this remanufactured camera as coming with the same stuff."
1,Missing Items Too!!!,"Received my camera today (05/22) and all items are not in the box. I am missing hand strap, Ni-MH batteries, Battery charger and Cradle adapter. Worse part is I DID RECEIVE A USB CABLE BUT IT IS NOT THE RIGHT SIZE AND DOESN'T FIT. This is very frustrating. How do I get the missing items?"
2,Careful with that install,"This design may or may not be reliable.. My mechanic installed one and my car kept overheating. I cannot be sure, short of doing a stovetop boiling test, that the thermostat opened properly. There is a chance the mechanic installed it upside down. The design of the thermostat lends itself to such a possible error. ""Murray"" thermostat may be a safer choice, as if it gets stuck, it sticks in the OPEN position only. I switched to one and now my car runs great."
5,Glass ornaments,"Lovely small glass ornaments. They looked very pretty on my small Christmas tree, but I fear they would be lost on a large tree."
3,not for a beginner in Korean,"At first glance this appears to be an excellent dictionary for a student of Korean. It was the one recommended for my University course in Korean. I have now been learning Korean for two years, and I still don't find this dictionary very helpful (but my Korean teacher does!).I think the main problem with the dictionary is that it is too comprehensive! Thus, when you look up a word, you may find five or six different meanings, which are not clearly differentiated in English (they may be in Korean). Similarly, attempting to use this dictionary to translate from English into Korean, one is faced with 6 possible verbs, when one would do, and with no indication of which would be the most usual.My recommendation would be to find a less comprehensive dictionary until you reach a pretty high level of Korean."
4,comprehensive,One of the best korean dictionaries although it isnot cheap. But it is comprehensive and worth buying if you can afford it.
2,Mediocre,"Modest album, thin and grey in aspect and content. Save your money, or maybe spend a little bit more on one of the many other book on this subject."
1,Didn't fit,Tried this blade on 3 different styles of 11 cup cuisinart food processors. This unit didn't fit any of them.
3,Breaking Strong Holds,"Dr. Walker wrote his book ""to explain the trouble of African-American family phenomenon in a spiritual way."" Part I of the book, ""The Strongholds in African-American families,"" is not much more than a listing of attitudes that cause difficulties in black families. Walker's discussion of those attitudes is brief and superficial. Part II of the book, however, gives a more detailed discussion of ways of overcoming problems that destroy African-American homes. The book ends with a brief but helpful appendices."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"If you're at all web savvy, you will find this compilation adds nothing to a thorough search you can do on your own, and it is already outdated!"
1,Cheap Greek art productiion,I think that this product is a cheap and non too professional feature of Greek art. I'm sorry I purchased it and I would definitely not recommend it to others.T here are so many other very good videos on Greek art compared with this shoddy one.
2,Not the quality I expected.,I bought this based on the information given that it was authentic Cuisinart. I am very dissapointed in the quality. It is plastic and the box had no markings that represent Cuisinart. I contacted the company to inquire about this and they told me I could return it but would owe the outbound and return shipping. When a product is misrepresented I didn't think that should have been the case. I decided keeping it is the only choice. By the time they charge me for all that shipping I'm out very little to keep it and let it fall apart.
2,It arrived broken...,It arrived broken. I need to speak to someone about trying to resolving the issue. No one has contacted me to discuss.
2,Noisy and not quality,I bought this as a food processor blender combo. It is so noisy I have to wear ear protection! When we were trying to break up sugar that had gotten hard after being stored in the basement the sugar broke a hole right through the bowl. I have also broken both of the pieces that hold the top to the bottom.
1,Do not purchase from this company,"If I could give them lower than one star I would. I ordered a white attachement from them and they proceded to send a black attachment. They sent me a email telling me that the white attachement is no longer available, but they still advertise on Amazon as having the white attachemtn in stock. I would like to get the white attachment, but can't trust this company or Amazon to get it right after this last order. If the product is no longer available it should be taken off the Amazon web site!"
1,Cuisinart Food Processor scam!,"Why I call this product a scam is because it was misrepresented in the ad! I expected to get a complete machine and received only the top part with no motor (who suspected that the caveat, ""Processor Duet Attachment"" meant ""no motor"")! Maybe I should have suspected something was missing because the price was so low! I had to go to a lot of trouble returning it and trying to get my money back, including the postage! I then ordered a Kitchenaid (referbished) and it is fine."
5,The Bible and Modern Artists,"For those familiar with Alter's other works on Biblical literature this will be a joy. It focuses on how three great modern writers use the Bible to create their own art. Although the three writers, Kafka, Bialik and Joyce use the Bible differently than traditional writers - they treat the Bible with the utmost respect. Alters shows how the great moderns appreciate the wonders of the Bible and use it to enhance their art. Canon and Creativity will help you understand the artistic process of the moderns and the ancients. This is a book that the writer clearly enjoyed writing - and the intelligent reader will enjoy reading."
5,The uses of the Biblical canon by modern creators,"Alter opens his book this way,""Over the last quarter of a century ,the term canon,which previously had been restricted to the body of Sacred Scripture approved by ecclesiastical authority, attained general currency in academic circles as designation for the corpus of secular literary works implicity or explicitly endorsed by established cultural authority as worthy of preservation through reading and study."" He speaks shortly afterwards about his goals in the work ,"" I want to explore the dynamics of canonicity,attending to the way the exemplary canonical corpus of the Western tradition,the Bible is assimilated and reused by poets and writers of fiction."" Alter goes on after examining "" The Double Canonicity of the Hebrew Bible "" to explore the way three ' secular 'writers Kafka, Bialik and Joyce put the 'Canon' to use for their own creative purpose.For those who love 'literary criticism ' at its best this is a work well- worth reading."
5,"""One Millliiionn Dollars""","Hahahahahahahahaha....what can I say. This has to be one of the funniest toys to buy out of the Austin Powers movies. I bought this as a joke on a person at work and I was surprised that most adults (over 40) have never watched these movies to know what this toy portrayed. I am rather old myself, but my children were young when these movies came out and rather than not spend time with them ,I optioned to sit and watch with them. Education value on this toy is zilch, quality is sub-standard, but I have to give it 5 stars cuz it is funny. Classic."
2,Disappointing? You Bet!,"Being quite the fan of Jane Austen and, particularly P&P, I looked forward to receiving and reading this book. Almost from the beginning the disapointment began to set in. Most troublesome was the fact that I was never quite sure in which setting a particular scene took place. The locations were not well described and the plot seemed to jump around. The many characters and intertwined relationships between them made the plot even more difficult to follow. Many of the sentences were sooooooo long that I had to re-read them several times to get the gist of what was being said. More than a few times I had to consult with Mr. Webster to ascertain the meanings of many of the more obscure words. I really was finished with the book about 3/4 of the way through but struggled through to the end which, in itself, was a big letdown. I'd pass on this one if I were you."
3,Adequate - but not compelling,"The author attempts to revisit Pemberley, but some parts fall short because the pacing is poor. I give Furley kudos for attempting to capture ""another"" Darcy-like character in Mr. Scott."
4,HP A6130n Desktop Computer,"The A6130n delivered in two days. Everything seems fine. However, there is no disc for the pre-installed OS and other software, and I have yet to figured out what to do if the harddisk crashes two years from now - Hence the 4 stars, for now."
5,Good Computer,"Purchased this for my daughter. She is very pleased with how it runs. She said the only problems she's had is the occasional lock up, but says it is due to Vista, not the HP."
2,HP Pavilion A6130N Desktop PC,Very disappointed in the HP Pavilion A6130N Desktop PC performance. Hung up multiple times during first day of use requiring a hard reboot. Packed it up and sent it back in. You would think with all that processing power it could handle Vista?
4,Good value for the price,"Like other reviews have stated, this computer has a good amount of ram,but could use an upgrade on the video. All other aspects seem to be fine."
3,I thought refurb meant re-tested,"I have had a lot of success with refurbished products. I can live with a scratch or dent for something that is going to sit under a desk. I also enjoy the savings which is why I opted for a refurbed unit. The specs on this unit are great.Out of the box the RJ-45 LAN network port did not work. I confirmed this by installing a separate LAN card in a free PCI slot which instantly connected to the internet. Fixing an on-board LAN port would not be simple, so I sent the unit back which the seller took with no questions. But it seems to me that a refurbished unit should have been tested. So to come from the factory a second time with this crucial component not working is pretty lame."
1,Disappointing,"Perhaps I misread the advert. The mechanics of this computer seem to work just fine. I had understood that Microsoft Office was on the computer. It was, but only student version and as a trial. Eventually after owning the computer over 18 months I am going to buy Office Professional as I can not transfer my XP version of Office to this Vista Computer. I can not use my version of quickbooks on Vista either so I still need to keep running all the other computers in my business on XP or the upgrades just eat up profits.Summing up. Good computer mechanically. Software was not what I had expected."
5,Great Hockey,"I don't think reviews can really help with deciding to purchase this. If you love hockey, then obviously you will enjoy this. Do you want to watch amazing hockey action? Buy it. I also own the Pittsburgh 10 Greatest Games and I think they did a better job with the packaging for the Washington set. Rather than a box of 5 thin dvd cases, they have one large dvd case that opens like a book and houses all of the DVDs."
1,hard to find five let alone ten great games in Cap history,"This is a DVD set stretched pretty thin given the failures of the Rod Langway-era Capitals to go deep in the playoffs. I get that now Alexander Ovechkin is ""the"" superstar but how about waiting until the Caps do something of significance in the playoffs before releasing anything like this?To be honest, the greatest game in Caps history was one they lost--the 1987 Mother's Day marathon OT Game 7 vs. the New York Islanders. That you can get on the Isles DVD set and is far superior to any of these games on this one as that had unreal action even during the 2nd and 3rd OTs when players were beyond tired.Skip this and wait another ten years to see if the Caps can compile enough games worthy to be called ""great."""
5,Toddler and infant can play together with the PolliPop,"I have this toy in my home for my two and a half year old great grandson and his 9 month old sister. The toddler places the balls at the top for the ride down. The great granddaughter will grab one as it comes down, put it in her mouth, then try to place the ball back on one of the bridges. She develops skills as she follows the ball to grab it. Sometimes she succeeds in getting a ball back on a bridge. It is also convenient that the toy fits back into the box for storage."
2,poor design,I bought this toy for my 18 month old. He really enjoyed it- while it stayed together. It falls apart easily and the balls slow down and routinely come to a complete stop! For this amount of money I would expect it to interlock better and for the balls to move freely (which is the entire point).
4,Good Book!,Growing up I had heard of Sgt York but never took the time to explore his story. This book was written by someone who actually met with Sgt York and learned the history of his family and just how the incident(as Sgt York referred to it)occured during World War I and resulted in medals and recognition from around the world for a humble man who only wanted to come home from war to farm a small piece of land in the mountains of Tennessee. I really enjoyed this book on my Kindle.
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this recently for my niece. It would be a great product, if it wasn't the same pictures over and over again. Also, when it's time to tear off a page, it rips, because the paper is so thin. In other words: don't buy it."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","For the asking price, we really expected better quality overall. My child enjoyed coloring the pages, but the plastic and paper are so cheap that it was really hard to rip the sheets cleanly. It was also very difficult to feed the paper through and the roll of paper was hard to pull out. On top of that, the markers and crayons are definitely of substandard quality. Stick with a coloring book. It'll be less frustrating for both you and your child."
1,Paper doesn't feed through,My daughter received this as a gift and it isn't worth buying. The paper ripped while trying to feed through and was hard to pull through because the roll doesn't rotate easily. The paper was ripping in the roll location and therefore wouldn't go though the rest of the way. The crayons and markers are very cheap and of poor quality. If you just take the paper roll out and cut the pages out to be colored they curl up and must be taped down to color. So this requires a lot of adult help. A coloring book would have been much better.
3,Good value. Horrible taste.,"Was really hoping to be able to stomach this Super Amino, but one taste and I had to throw it out. It tastes like you combined old fish with milk, vasoline and berries. It's a great value if you can stand the taste and contains so many necessarily amino acids."
3,"Yes to Orange, No to Berry",I've tried both Orange and Berry flavor of these! In my opinion orange was good but the berry tasted horrible! I had to have a chaser after drinking the berry one! I couldn't finish the berry bottle!
1,Problem whit the Flavor,"Hello Dear Seller.Please, cheack all the Expired date of your products, before send it. Because this item has problem whit the flavor, It is different to the firts that I bought to the same seller. I bought two times the same Super Amino Grape flavor, and the second has a flavor very different to the first. It was a bad flavor. and when i check the expired date, it is out of day.Thanks"
3,Agnes Browne,Can't really review this as I can't play it. Didn't realise that this wasn't my regional code (note for overseas buyers) so its not really any good to me at the moment
4,Good for beginner,"You will find the quite difficult to follow, but it is interesting to read and you will find new information on each page if VC is stranger to you."
4,Worth a look,"While not exactly my favourite film, Undertow is well worth a look and was better than I expected. The tragic family tale is somewhat familiar but well told.Cinematography is excellent.A welcome touch is the exhibition of the 1982-vintage United Artists logo (by Sandy Dvore) and theme (by Joe Harnell), which is a fitting prelude to the dramatic and tragic nature of the story told in the film. It is believed that this superseded UA theme was requested specifically by the young director, David Gordon Green."
3,3 out of 5 Stars,"This is the sort of movie I would say is worth watching but not something I would never buy. I thought Jamie Bell did an excellent job and enjoyed his performance. The movie moved a bit slow in parts and I think more suspense could have been added. I was not too happy with the ending , I prefer movies with clear endings and not ones that are open to interpretation."
3,"bloated, but jamie bell runs around in his skivvies","so why does THIS one get 3 stars? well, to be truthful, it IS an ok movie. but mainly its because it stars a white hot jamie bell and also stars devon alan, as jamies kid brother; hes pretty and runs around in his underwear too, so the movie deserves an extra star."
1,PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!!!!,All i can say about this movie was it was too slow i wanted more and i just couldn't take anymore serious!!!!! When i saw previews for this movie it looked intense and something that would keep me on the edge of my seat!!!! All it did was put me to sleep and i ended up watching only about 15 minutes until i had to turn it off!!!! If i was you i wouldn't waste my time or my money on seeing this movie!!!!!!
2,pulled under,"Be forewarned, this is an odd movie. Really had hopes for this independent movie based on all the reader reviews, but after watching it this past weekend I'd have to say that the one & two star reviews written up here on Amazon pretty much nailed this movie. Disjointed, motivations unclear, so many details begging to be established, a little bit of atmosphere and some moments of good cinematography can't save this disappointing film. It's like a homemade loaf of bread missing a few ingredients and pulled out of the oven too soon. Though Terrance Malick is listed as a producer, this story doesn't come close to any of his films in substance, just a slight resemblance in style. Added a star for Jamie Bell's performance, which I found to be the only consistent bright spot in this feature."
4,The only reason I bought this movie,"Kristen Stewart is why I bought this movie. She has a small role, Jamie Bell girlfriend. It was her first movie kiss, she looked adorkable! The beginnings of her long indie films career. I love this actress.I was surprised I enjoyed the movie afterwards. Jamie Bell is excellent, as always. Dermot M is surprisingly eerie good."
2,Odd Piece of Southern Goth,"Undertow starts nicely - particularly in detailing the world of the boys in this rural drama. However, after a while it becomes too rote as a thriller/chase film.Both boys turn in great perfomances and Mulroney is very good as the terminally depressed, bitter and unlucky father.There is some great mood setting up-front that disolves as the story moves into thriller territory. As a thriller however, it is still a little too languid with some major over-indulgent moves by the director. Frankly, it looked beautiful but turned dull.Rental only, if interested."
4,"DARK, TENSE SOUTHERN GOTHIC THRILLER","UNDERTOW (MGM) is a Southern Gothic gem from David Gordon Green.Set in rural Georgia and rife with characters akin (or should I say ""kin""?) to Flannery O'Conner's or William Faulkner's best creations, ""Undertow"" detonates when Dermot Mulroney's seemingly friendly, grinning, long lost brother (Josh Lucas) arrives at the farm widower Mulroney shares with his two young sons (Jamie Bell and Devon Alan).Lucas has an agenda beyond hooking up with his brother and violence and murder follow in his wake. The two boys end up on the run.Intense, desperate and meandering, the plot comes together in an ending that is open to highly metaphorical interpretation.Terrence Malick was a producer and there are elements of his films (""Days of Heaven,"" ""Badlands,"" ""The Thin red Line"") in both style and content. The cinematography by Tim Orr is especially lush as is the evocative score by Philip Glass."
2,MAKES NO WAVES,"One of this critically acclaimed independent films that could have been told in thirty minutes. UNDERTOW touts itself as as thriller, but it's lackluster in that department. The movie moves slower than a Mississippi mudslide, and its main asset is the performance of Jamie Bell as the teenaged hero of the piece. Bell (Billy Elliott, Deathwatch) manages to convey the awkwardness of youth, a teen on the verge of manhood who finds himself in the protective role of his younger, frail brother (an annoying performance from Devon Alan). The weak plot centers on their uncle's sudden appearance (Josh Lucas in a rather disappointing performance) and the uncle's desire to find the valuable coins left to him and the boys' father (Dermot Mulroney). Murder enters the picture and a slow-paced chase scenario develops. Director David Gordon Green's artistry gets in the way of the pacing of the film and I found myself wanting the movie to end long before it fulfilled that wish. A real disappointment."
5,Wonderful Album,"this cd is amazing every song is great. yeah, it is catchy and maybe a overpopulated style of play, but damn these guys are good. this is one of my favorite cds of 05', it is superior to still remains but just a shade behind agony scenes latest. get this cd asap. and stay metal \m/ \m/"
5,Haste The Day. Christian hardcore at its finest.,"As I Lay Dying and Still Remains also are two christian metalcore and hardcore bands at their finest. ""Burning Bridges"" and ""When Everything Falls"" are two great CD's. Once you buy these albums you wont regret it. Even though this CD has more singing this can still match up to ""Burning Bridges"" and pretty much does because Haste The Day knows what music they make and they know the path they have chosen. One of 2005's hit albums that you should buy along with ""Burning Bridges."""
2,Disappointed,"Burning Bridges surprised you with new breakdowns, non-stop intensity, and an extremely good blend of screaming vs. singing, proving that Haste the Day had loads of talent and potential as an upcoming metalcore band. I eagerly awaited their second release, expecting even more of this intensity.However, When Everything Falls left me disappointed. While there still were decent breakdowns and the music was still pretty driving, everything sounded the same. There was a lot more singing, which for me was another disappointment, but that's just preference (as is my dislike for their cover song). The intensity seemed to have been lost somewhere inbetween their live performance and the recording, because they were the most intense and heaviest show I saw of the 28 shows I went to at Cornerstone Festival this summer- but it's just not there when I listen to it on the CD.Haste the Day is still a great band, they just don't have much that separates them from the rest anymore."
5,Jimmy's last,"Lets start off by saying that Haste the Day was one of my favorite bands (RIP) so I'm totally biased when reviewing this band. For me this album and burning bridges were HTD's best because Jimmy's lyrics and the way the band felt with him in it wasn't replaceable, not that Steven didn't do a good job but obviously it wasn't the same and I'm not sure they ever reached the bar that the band set with Jimmy in it. All of the songs are great but of course my personal favorite is When Everything Falls because the lyrics get me every time.."
5,THE BEST,I AM A BIG HASTE THE DAY FAN BUT I STILL REGUARDLESSLY SAY THAT IF YOU LIKE HEAVY METAL YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD. IT IS REDICULESSLY HEAVY BUT HAS WELL PUT HARMONY AND GOOD MEANINGS IN JUST ABOUT ALL OF THEIR SONGS. IT HAS HEAD BANGING WRITTEN ALL OVER IT. FOR ALL OF THE MUSICIANS OUT THERE IT WILL ENTERTIAN YOU BECAUSE THESE MUSICIANS ARE VERY GOOD.THEY ARE NOT SLOPPY LIKE PANTERA BUT SOUND LIKE AN EXTREMELY WELL OILED MACHINE.TAKE MY WORD FOR IT THIS IS A WHOLESOME HEAVY METAL BAND. IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND THINK HEAVY METAL IS GOOD TO THE SOUL YOU WILL ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD.
3,Meh.........,"this album isnt bad, but its nothing special. i feel musically, i might be superior to Burning Bridges, but this album isnt all that great. the driving verses are great, but almost every single song has a sung chorus... (and they all sound the same!) at times i cant tell if im listening to still remains, it dies today, or some other mediocre metalcore band. this album isnt horrible, but its nothing new or fresh by any means. i give it three stars b/c theyre a talented band who plays their style well... but beyond that, please find a better album."
1,Pathetic.,"What is worse than a cookie-cutter metalcore band despretly trying to match the musical outcome of bigger bands and coming off as a cheep thrill? Well, there is Haste the Day. I liked their first release, but this one just sucks. Their first one was more creative and less predicable while this one is the opposite. All the songs are the same structure and the lyrics just suck. The only thing I like about this Cd is The vocals remind me of Daniel Wydatt's (Zao)."
5,One of the few Christian Metal bands worth listening to.,"I don't have a whole lot of christian CDs in my collection, but this is well worth the buy. This is by far the best christian band that is out their. Even if your not into the whole religion thing, you should buy this CD if you want some of metalcores finest. this band is for fans of ""As I Lay Dying"", ""The Agony Scene"", and ""Demon Hunter"". Pick this CD up NOW.-Metalhead 4 Life-"
2,This pan won't last for 6 monthes!,I bought this stir-fry pan based on some good reviews from a leading consumer magazine. It's a nice-looking pan and has the right weight I prefer. Cleaning is easy too. The major problem with my first pan was the non-stick coating started peeled off just after a couple of monthes. I called Cuisinart and they provided an exchange. Now half a year past and my second pan lost the coating on the bottom again. I just use this pan 2 or 3 times a week and I don't know whether I should call Cuisinart again or start shopping for a different brand.
2,Poor non-stick coating,"Great looking pan and the right size for everyday cooking.Very disappointed by the quality of the non-stick coating, it wore off after a few months of use and this is despite carefully handwashing the pan."
3,Make sure it's big enough for you,"This is a good product but smaller than expected. Picture can be deceiving--this is not a wok (think at least 12.5"" to 13"" for a typical wok)."
1,poor nonstick coating,"the pan looks good in the kitchen, it cooks fast. the problem with it is the nonstick coating wore off after 2-3 months. the pan is no good when the nonstick starting to disappear."
1,this cd is terrible.,"Warning, If you like Mushroomhead you will not immediately like this. Unless you are into bad hair-metal and cheezy songs, this cd is not for you. Just listen to the first several notes of the first song...its so choppy and there is no cohesiveness to the songs. It sounds like random metal. I like Mushroomhead a lot but they are a GOOD metal band. It sounds like Jeff Hatrix is trying to sound like half Joey Belladonna(Old Anthrax) and half James Hetfield(metallisuck). And personally I dont like either of those guys! I always preferred John Bush in Anthrax but thats another thing. Anyway, Dont buy this cd b/c it is boring and not worth the listen. buy it and you'll sell it fast...like I did. Blows. Nuff said"
3,Its another Stainless Steel/Rustless Rodent story,"Not as good as the orginal story and idea- its a parody of a parody about pop cultures use on pop music. Its ""OK"" but if you don't read it you're not missing much."
5,the beginning of the rat series,"This volume contains the three prequel novels to the stainless steel rat books, and each is an easy and enjoyable read - the kind of thing that relaxes me and puts me in a good mood. Highly recommended."
3,Great promise of things to come,"I thoroughly recommend this book to Spirit fans, but not necessarily as the ideal introduction to the Great Spirit.This volume is The Spirit's springtime.""The Spirit"" at his greatest was characterised by excellent stories, well paced, superb viewer angles in the art-work, and wonderful tension built by the ambiguity in the relationships between the Spirit and the regular characters.In this volume the stories are good, and the pacing and the angles are developing. The cast of characters is only in its infancy.The masterpieces are yet to come in future volumes."
1,"Right Movie, Wrong Description","If you are looking for a particular movie titled HELL'S BELLES,then you need to be careful because there are at least five or more movies out there with this title.The video cover that they are showing here of a guy sitting on a rock in front of flames while a girl with a devils tail stands in front of him is NOT the movie I got when I ordered this.That movie is rated ""X"" and is Directed by Ed Hansen (PARTY PLANE, BIKINI CARWASH CO.) and stars Terence Cooper and Martin Howeller. It was released in 1997. That is what I thought I was getting when I ordered this movie.Instead, they sent me a movie that was released in 1969 rated ""M"" and was directed by Maurey Dexter and starring Jeremy Slate and Adam Roarke. I haven't viewed it yet but apparently it is a late 60's biker movie.The main character wins a new motorcycle and has it stolen from him. He spends the rest of the movie trying to get it back ."
3,wild angels / hell's belles,"Peter Fonda was great in Easy Rider and was equally the same in Wild Angels, the plot was well scripted for the 60's, didn't care for the Home Town Church scene, that's what branded bikers in the first place... not too cool!!"
3,Funny,The Fonda flick was good. Kinda funny really. I did'nt really care to much for the 2nd movie. I only watched the full film because I was in Iraq and I had aleady seen every other movie I took with me about 5 times......
3,Not bad for an Oldie,"I actually preferred Hell's Belles to the other one. Wild Angels was a little over the top with the church scene but fun anyway. On Hell's Belles, the soundtrack with fight scene made us laugh."
5,Information-packed!,"The author presents a concise, information-packedbook on effectively conducting your own garage sale.From start to finish, he provides valuable tidbits ofenlightenment in areas I haven't seen covered in othergarage sale books.A pleasure to read. You will not find this book itself forsale at a garage sale - it's a keeper!"
5,"Best available dive guide to the BVI, IMO.","We're divers who have visited BVI several times, and we think Jim Scheiner's bok is the best guide available for diving the islands. - Jim and his wife Odile are accomplished videographers and photographers with a shop at Baskin in the Sun's location in the Prospect Reef resort in Tortola, and they have extensive knowledge of the area- they're passing some of this knowledge on to visiting divers. - My only wish is they'd expand the book in its next edition, as there are so many interesting BVI dives sites!"
3,Diving BVI,"Got the book in time to use it in BVI this October. This is a great reference book that has good descriptions of the sites, but lacks coordinates and commercial bouy information. BVI is a good place for ""dead reckoning"" navigation but finding some of the bouys was a challenge, and when finally locating, some where commercial dive boats only. We used the commercial bouys anyway as we were there during a slow time, but during busy times this could get frustrating and a waste of valuable daylight looking for a spot when on a sail boat. Bottom line is that enough useful information can be obtained over the internet including GPS coordinates that may make this book irrevalent."
4,good everyday bracelet,"well made, fits and looks good too.I don't worry about losing or breaking it.classy alternative to wearing gold andvery affordable"
2,Have mercy upon me!,"This is a drone. If your heart hasn't been broken before you bought this, you'll soon get that way after listening to it as long as you can stand it. I suppose that if you were looking for good conversation music to play at your own wake, this would fit perfectly. Otherwise, avoid - save your money and purchase anything conducted by Bernstein, you'll live a longer, happier life."
4,Scary ambient noize,"STENORETTE sounds like a fine mixture between ambient, shoegazer, and experimental noise, with lush pianos and gorgeous, almost subliminal vocals. ""Tomorrow"", the beautiful opener, stands out. A great choice for a night listening with headphones, and scare the hell out of you."
1,Don't buy this item -- it's too much trouble to insert the CD every time you want to use it.,"This item only works if the CD is in the computer, and then not very well. It's awkward and hard to use, and too much trouble to have to insert it every time I want to use it."
5,All I Can say is FINALLY!,Finally MXC is gonna get the attention it deserves and be released on DVD. Every MXC fan worth their Red Helmet and Safety Fluid must buy this. Hopefully it will get enough orders to show that MXC deserves more Season DVDs.gphoenix51 - MXC YahooGroups Member
4,very funny,was very disappointed in the time it took to be delivered. Over 6 weeks. It was a xmas gift for someone. It was ordered mid November and it arrived after the new year.
1,Mocks Takeshi and everyone on the show to the max.,"If you like the show because of Takeshi's work then you'll dislike this DVD. The Americans sure know how to ruin some hilarious material.I found this DVD quite offensive to it's presenters and participants...the commentators are totally lame.On the other hand, if you're in to this type of commentary and you've seen the show before then I'm sure it will live up to your expectations.The one good thing about this DVD was the original Japenese episode, it was great to see the little storyline they put into each episode which is not included in the UK and US version.5/5 for Takeshi, 0/5 for the commentators."
5,FINALLY!,"I've been waiting years for MXC to finally come out on DVD! If you're looking for a collection of shows that is guaranteed to make you laugh, for the price of two overpriced martinis with blue cheese olives, you can laugh yourself into a possible health crisis. It's that funny. And, if you have trouble finding just the right gift for any male friend, relative, or other category of loved one, look no more. Also for women with slightly off-kilter humor. I find the female friends who enjoy this show are the same ones who like the ""falling down"" ""passing out"" or ""stupid crash"" montages on America's Funniest Home Videos (the first 10 years worth, anyway). And if anyone out there knows me and considers me a loved one, I see the perfect Christmas gift in my future.Marie"
5,Funny Stuff,"Most Extreme Elimination is brilliant writing disguised as slap-stick comedy...they get a group of people willing to risk making complete fools of themselves while the ""masters of ceremony"" make the funniest comments about their performance. I never miss MXC on television and enjoy watching this dvd each time I play it."
4,MXC Review,"If you're a fan of MXC, then this is a must buy. You get about 12 episodes plus the original show in Japanese (english subtitles). Only wish that they make the latter seasons on DVD soon."
5,DON'T GET ELIMINATED!!!!!!!,"I can't wait until October 3rd!!! Until then, don't fall in the mystery fluid. There are some great clips on youtube and ifilm for those of who can't get enough MXC."
5,funny - funnier - funniest,"Along with Batman and the politically incorrect but hilarious Amos and Andy, MXC is one of the three funniest shows ever on TV. And,with Amos and Andy, it is now on DVD. Kenny, Vic and Guy can now join Andy, Kingfish and Mama in your own living room. Laugh yourself silly, forget today's news and visit the never-never land of these wonderful people who, unfortunately, just exist in our imaginations."
5,Awesome,"Yes, it is awesome. All the original shows you used to see on tv with the English commentary. Just what you were looking for."
3,Not what I expected,"I love Mountain. Leslie West is one of the more underappreciated guitarists, However, ""Eruption"" is not very good. The sound quality is bad, and it seems to be a compilation of various live concerts not necessarily the two listed on the cd. At one point during ""Dreams of Milk and Honey"" West mentions that Felix Pappalardi is playing base. Impossible if the concert dates are correct. Leslie West never could sing, afterall, he was a guitar player, but on these 2 cds his voice is shot, not to mention the sound quality. I still love Mountain but this cd is for completists only."
3,"Single Holster, Double Pocket","Don't believe the picture! The two pockets are not separate, they are very connected. All in all, it serves it purpose, but I purchased this holster in particular because I thought that I would get 2 individual, free standing pockets for this holster."
3,Attack has faded away,"First of all, i would like to say that i've been listening to this album for about 3 weeks (that's not a big secret that 100th window was available in internet long before its official release), so i can already make a final conclusion about it. As a person addicted to Protection and Mezzanine i must admit that i've been disappointed. Why? Because all i heard was sort of 'dark ambient', extremely monotoneous and faceless. All the tracks are incredibly similar to each other, and what is most important, they have nothing to turn me on.. The same slow melancholic melody plays over and over again.."
1,"Do not buy it (destructive ""Copy-Control"")","Hi!""100th Window"" has a so called ""copy control"" system, which led my old Win95-system to a bitter crash. Since this system runs on MS Windows technology only, it can't be played on a Mac at all. Moreover you have trouble adding the content to your MP3-selection (all my MP3s are 100% legal).And the music? It does not even come close to the other albums of this band.Maybe that is why ""copy control"" was added: To prevent that this information spreads to quickly. Too bad the real pirates have an edge at the technology side....So what is this stupid ""copy protection"" for? To prevent rightous customers from buying more cds of this band!"
5,you can't deny massive attack,"& well, if you do you're a moron. ""this doesn't live up to par."" ""this is a disappointment"" well maybe, just maybe, if people didn't have expectations of musicians then this wouldn't happen. with your favorite bands you have to take every new album as if it was just that, NEW. they can't constantly repeat themselves otherwise they'd wind up joining the likes of meaningless drivel....which is something MA will never do. yes, it's depressing, but you say it as if it's a bad thing. what's wrong with depressing music? nothing. this release is a much more atmospheric album. but amazing none the less. like the title of my review says, you simply cannot deny massive attack."
3,monotone,"What can i say? i was expecting some of the deep thumping beats from Mezzanine, only to find a single flat note carried trough the album. Even though this isn't all that exciting to listen too, it is still nice. I enjoy listening to the flat low bass and the drawn out vocal notes of ""Everywhen"", and the lines from ""Future Proof"" stick in my head all day (Boarderline case, re-enforced glass.....) i don't know what it is about the haunting melodies that stick with me and make me put it in the cd player, but i'll have to give it 3 stars."
4,good stuff here...,"If you are a fan of dark, moving music and did not think highly of this album, then something is wrong with you. My only question for Massive Attack is when do we get more?"
4,"not bad, but certainly no mezzanine","I'm kind of disappointed with the latest Massive Attack effort, even considering the fact I thought the band had, um, disbanded for good. It's okay, certainly listenable, but not terribly original. Much of it sounds just like Mezzanine, which is still one of my favourite albums.Funny... I had the same reaction to Underworld's latest, which also has the word ""100"" in the title."
4,electronica,"As someone who does not have to compare this album to the previous ones ( I never listened to them )I have only to say that Sinead should stick to writing as the tracks with her singing are not the best tracks.The ones that truly stand out are the ones that dare to delve deeper into the exploration of sound and texture and where vocals are less sung and more of a contribution to the overall sound pallette of this album .As a seasoned electronic music listener I can only recomend this album it's deep and innovative ,just jump in and immerse yourself."
5,"Hypnotic, Ethereal, Seductive Music","More than being a worthy successor to the trail-blazing track record of Massive Attack, 100th Window turns out to be a mind-boggling work of abstract art that is hardly parallelled in contemporary music. The hypnotic numbers vibrate with unusually structured rhythms and frequently transcends into ethereal beauty. Easily the best album of Massive Attack, it is also arguably the greatest music released in a decade. I heartily recommend this to every one - please rush and buy this pulsating album and get lost in its music. The problem is you'll find it difficult to trace your way back!!"
3,More Mezzanine,"The Massive Attack group have been the Adam & Eve of the mutt genre called trip hop, downbeat, downtempo, chill, etc.. Their work is required listening for any true student of the genre. However 100th window is the least important out of the lineup.The group promised to keep on changing their sound, but this album sounds very similar to Mezzanine without the sublime attraction.Any completist will buy it instantly because of the mythical standing Massive Attack has in electronic music history."
2,OK at Best.,"The fact that fans of Massive Attack are comparing their latest work (favourably) with Madonna's wretched music sums up very nicely everything that is wrong with this album. It adds absolutely nothing to their catalogue and Sinead O'Conner was a singularly uninspired choice for a guest vocalist. Finally, this is a ""Massive Attack"" album in name only, as two of the three absolutely essential bandmates left, leaving 3-D to his own devices to inflict this turgid dross upon us.I'm a long-time fan of Massive Attack and have given this album many chances. I was a bit on the fence regarding it, but seeing so many desperate 5-star reviews from people with such obviously low expectations reinforces how far this band has sunk. My copy is already residing in the trash-bin."
2,"Not an ""experience"" like Mezzanine","100th Window ia a decent album, BUT fails to engulf you like Mezzanine does. This album was a huge letdown considering I waited IMPATIENTLY for years for the follow-up to Mezzanine. I would guess that those people who gave this album 5 stars, have never listened to Mezzanine."
1,bland,"i'm a huge MA fan but unfortunately this is very very bland!sure, the production is good (as you'd expect) but the songs just bored me.it's the first time i've ever bought a MA album and not even made it to the end of the first track before hitting the 'next' button. the same happened with the 2nd, 3rd etc. i've listened to it time and time again, sure that it would grow on me but it didn't.in fact the best and most exciting moment of this cd was unwrapping it and putting it in the cd player; the bit before i realised how dull it was.and what's with the 10 minute long modulating single note at the end? it might have been 'cool & groovy' to do that in the '60's but it aint any more. it's just boring.very disapointing"
1,"Dropped the hop from ""trip hop"" - one-third of the attack","Disappointing after all the wait. A sad day for fans. This album is boring.Most importantly, two of the main songwriters from their previous albums, Marshall and Vowles, are glaringly missing.This is not Massive attack. It is the Robert Del Naja and Sinead O'Connor show.No more of the smooth laid back rapping style that I loved from their previous albums. It suffers from a lack of variety opting for a more consistent (read: monotonous) sound throughout. Where are the guitars or the energy of previous releases? 3 Sinead songs is three too many. Her ""Prayer for England"" is the worst track with M.A. written on it.I'm beginning to think that there are a lot people being paid to write 5 star ""customer reviews"" of albums. This trend is disheartening, although I'm not surprised. Be wary! Before you buy an album spend some time listening to it at the store, even if you've liked all of the artist's previous albums (like Massive Attack)."
2,Pretty Dull,"I have to agree with a lot of the other dedicated MA fans and say that 100th window is a huge let down from Massive Attack. While Mezzanine is beautifully dark and powerful, 100th window is dark but lacks any power. I have listened to 100th window a good 10 times and still find it hard to remember a single track. The only one that stands out is the single ""special cases""and that's not because it's good, but because it's the only track that sounds different. The rest of 100th window is mostly lite a fluffy ambient filler. Sinead O'conner who lends vocals to 3 tracks, sounds awfully tired and her voice just doesn't fit the music in my opinion. She sounds especially awful on 'A prayer for England'. With 9 tracks at a whopping 73 minutes long, 100th window might make for some interesting background noise for a while. Just make sure you are doing something else while you listen to it or you will surely fall asleep. 2.5 stars."
2,Disappointing... and Dangerous !!!,Disappointing since all the hip hop influences are now gone. This CD is more like an electronica record. No more rap rythms. It sounds like an old Cocteau Twins without inspiration...Dangerous since because of the copy protection mechanism the CD got stuck in my iMac. And it took me a really hard time to get it out... :-(
1,100th window - massive attack,"i can't understand how some people can compare this album to the sexy broody sound of mezzanine. i think 100th window show's what happens when artists take themselves far too seriously. i have every other massive attack album and with the exception of the mad professor, love them, a lot. i too have given this album a fair chance. the word that comes to mind is boring!"
2,I tried to listen. I left it and came back...,"...but this album in no way reflects the Massive Attack we've all grown to love. Blue Lines and Mezzanine are both great, must buy albums and have remained in my CD player for years. I can't give the same endorsement to this album. My biggest complaint is that the vocals are weak. They have lost the urban sound/feel that made them great."
2,Boring.,"Massive Attack isn't even Massive Attack anymore, it is just 3-D, it's 9 tracks and 75 minutes long. The stand out is track two if you can call it that with Sinead O'Conner, she appears on two other tracks. Other news about 3-D, he was arrested for having innappropriate materials on his computer and enough ectasy and heroin to keep a clinic in business for weeks. I refuse to support any efforts by this man."
1,Sad,"I have now given this album ample opportunity to mesh with my musical brain but to no avail....I recently transferred it onto my ipod using itunes and you have the opportunity to 'rate' it using a 1 star,2 star rating etc...like amazon...I still only gave it 1 star...very sad considering that 'Protection' is right next to it in my ipod now with a 5 star rating....Whatever happened to them is just very,very sad.... :-("
1,Aburridisimo,Me quiero ir a dormir!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!la única canción chevere es la numero 5 Butterfly caught excelente canción!!!!!!!!!!!
3,WIsh I'd spent my money on something else . . .,"I absolutely love Mezzanine, I love Tricky's work outside Massive Attack, and when I heard Sinead O'Connor was going to supply vocals on the new album I couldn't wait to hear it. But I feel seriously disappointed . . . .... Every song on this CD seems to have the same tempo, and it's slow. It may as well be one looong and boooring song. If you like that song, cool. But if you're hoping for Mezzanine, don't bother with the new CD. It's not ""scary"" or ""spooky"" it's just slow. We've waited how many years for this CD to come out?"
2,nothing massive....,"as a sinead o connor ""comeback"" album, this would have been splendid.as it is, del naja provides nothing but mediocre ambiance and backing to sinead's nothing-special vocals...this is NOT a followup to ""mezzanine"". not in my head, at least."
1,Massive Withdrawl,"This is the most pathetic attempt at an album from this group that I could have possibly immagined in my wildest dreams. I have always been a big fan of MA and their previous works are all top notch, but this CD was a total disappointment. Totally uninspiring, lacking in everything, boring, depressingly depressing, not a single track stands out as a highlight in any way whatsoever. What is Sinead O'Conner doing here, and what does she have to contribute? Did they bump into her at the pub on the way to the recording and asked her to come along for a wrist slashing session? Give this a wide berth and pick up a copy of any of their previous releases instead, (ie, Blue Lines, Protection, Mezzanine are all brilliant). 100th Window is a shocker,,,BLAND-BLAND-BLAND!!! Waste of Money."
3,"bland, monotonous - stick with mezzanine instead","After listening 5 times, the disc continues not to impress. The tempo is the same throughout all 9 tracks. The lyrics are drug-induced stream-of-consciousness rambles, rather than the emotional singing featured on certain tracks of Mezzanine. ""Antistar"" is the only track with a hook. If the liner notes didn't mention the guest appearance of Sinead O'Connor, I would never have recognized her. This disc puts me in the same mood as ""Psyence Fiction"" from UNKLE. i.e., not a good one. Overall, it feels bleak and non-inspiring."
2,Disappointment,"I realize Massive has a great deal to live up to considering the success of their previous albums, but if they were going to kick out something this mediocre, they should have left well enough alone. I keep listening to the album over and over, trying to enjoy the novel music of a band that blew me away with ""Mezzanine."" It's not working. The only track of any substance is the final one. Otherwise, the amount of filler on this album is overwhelming. I still support the band for their pioneering musicianship, but I hope they see the error of their ways and get back to creating substantive music, or else just call it a day."
5,WAY better than the reviews led me to believe,"No Tracey Thorn. No Elizabeth Fraser. But this is still cool and classy as hell. Very timely and sober. ""Protection"" is still my favorite album by them, but this comes in a close second. There's a cohesiveness to it that I find appealing.It makes a perfect soundtrack to CNN in February, 2003."
2,"a sad, sad disappointment","This latest Massive Attack release -- what in fact would be more aptly defined as 3D's solo effort -- finds the Bristol ""wild bunch"" retracing the ground that Mezannine opened. The dark, brooding beats were new in '98, but they're getting abit old now, no? Moroever, Sinead O'Connor's shrill croonings were a bad choice for the album--remember that this is the band that has featured the likes of Shara Nelson, Traci Thorn and Liz Frazer.Given the brilliant experimentation between Blue Lines, Protection and Mezannnine, one would have hoped for a few more inspired tunes. At the end of the day, one can't help but think that Mushroom's departure robbed the band of the creative impulse that distinguished Massive Attack's previous albums. Perhaps next time around they might look to their roots, take a step forward and continue the genre-breaking, original work for which we love them."
3,A Lot To Live Up To,"If only 100th Window was the debut album of Massive Attack, my expectations would have been much less. Having set the bar with Blue Lines, then raising it with Protection and Mezzanine, I see this effort lacking an invisible element. Mushroom and Daddy G are obviously missing (I'm told Daddy G will be back for the next Massive effort).Del Naja (3D) is an artist first. He's taken his art to our ears making this a welcome challenge to the senses. Sinead can't do wrong and I love the fact that she represents herself in the album credits versus some stupid label. I just wish I could groove to 100th a bit more instead of sitting and pondering about the unforseen future.Don't get me wrong, 100th blows away any other release within the electronic/trip hop genre for 2002/2003. Maybe the upcoming remixes will include some hidden gems. Then again we're talking about Massive Attack right? That's a lot to live up to."
3,Mezzanine II,"""100th Window"" is very much a continuation of the sounds and atmosphere Massive Attack first unleashed on ""Mezzanine."" That dark, almost claustrophobic atmosphere is very much present, the production is extraordinarily crisp, and the attention to detail is superb.The vocalists: The Horace Andy tunes are uniformly excellent, although there's nothing here as great as ""One Love,"" from Blue Lines, or ""Man Next Door,"" from Mezzanine. Sinead O'Connor is in fine form here, and I found her breathy vocalizations tempered the depth of production very nicely. Robert Del Naja has a passable voice, but I would have preferred additional songs with guest vocalists.As with all MA releases, this album really rewards a contemplative listen or two with good headphones. I'm repeating myself, but there really is just a tremendous amount of depth and detail to these songs."
3,One notch down but still very respectable,"The magic had to run out one day. After 3 seminal albums, Massive Attack have slipped a notch. Unlike much of what's been said, 100th Window is not a bad album. 'A Prayer For England', its finest moment, is perfect music played at huge volume in a dark room, all spooky soundscapes and otherworldly vocals from Sinead O'Connor. However, much of the album is Massive Attack-by-numbers, lost in a sea of beats and sound on 'Everywhen' and 'Name Taken' that mask a certain lack of ideas or coherent pop hooks that always formed the centre of their sound. Its still a rich, intense album which shows fantastic musicianship, but it does slip a notch from the brilliance of previous albums."
2,"Good concept, but my ears do not like it completely","Defined as Trip-Hop that is dark, moody and unpredictable, Massive Attack does a good job at living up to those descriptions. However, the end result is a product that I just don't like too much. I like Trip-Hop that is moody, but as usual with most Trip-Hop that I come across, there are only 2 or 3 songs that I may like. I think it may be due to the experimental nature of the genre. This CD is no exception. I like the tracks that Sinead O'Connor lends her voice on and Track #4 ""Everywhen"", but the last few tracks, specifically 7-9, were skipped really fast. As with Massive Attack's other CD's, I can't say that I liked the whole CD, but I can definitely say that there were some outstanding tracks. Especially on the ""Blue Lines"" CD. I can't even say that about this CD. I liked some of the songs, but there was nothing that really stood out to me as a classic. Oh well, it happens......"
3,Fine,"The songs escalate to a peak, but never pass that point. I liked Mezzainine where some songs would give you that relieving feeling of going past that point and breaking out into some heavy guitar beats."
2,Wow...we waited that long for THIS?,"Geez criminy is this thing awful. I believe I am pretty open minded, but I'm not going kid myself and call this album anything but a HUGE disappointment. As if a shoddy Part II of Mezzanine, 100th Window just plain drones on... and on. In short, a dud. The album is so ""chilled out"" that it ends up being completely boring ... The only saving grace tracks are Sinead O'Conner's and Everywhen. The last track is utter rubbish, being simply a keyboard loop for coma victims. Save your money for fries and a milkshake."
3,This Cd would have been a lot better if this was the first massive Attack CD I ever heard.,"But it's not. This CD isn't bad, per se, but it's not Massive Attack. There is only one orginial member left in the group and you can obviously tell by listening to 100th window. Some songs are too long and drawn out and some of the vocals are ridiculously unlistenable. But it's not comepletely bad. There's still the mellow, dark mood that I fell in love with. Another reason I gave it a three is because Sinead O'Connor sings in a few songs, which isn't bad, but she brings with her, her political views (in A prayer for England) and it makes this cd sound even less like Massive Attack. I was disspointed, but then I figured, hey, its better than blue lines."
2,DEPRESSING,"Loved the previous CD's and so was very disappointed with this one, too dark and depressing, not all what i expected."
2,"Like Mezzanine, with even less to say (if that were possible","The thing that frustrated me right off the bat about this CD was that the new ""anti-piracy"" protection completely FUBARs playing this disk on my computer. I live in a small apt, so my iBook IS my cd player. I get 3 minutes of silence at the beginning of track one, all the other track times are off by that three minutes and the last track cuts off three minutes at the end.But here's the kicker... that lost 3 minutes at the end? Its the same sampled sound playing over and over. I lost NOTHING.The album itself is mediocre at best. I would rate the songs, but the all sound the same and are instantly forgetable. I thought Tricky's last offering was boring and commercially poised, but the rest of the MA family have exceeded far and wide in those categories.I'm sure it will be a hit with the ""alternative"" radio stations around the world. **yawn**"
1,they let us down!!!,"even after julia childs bakes 100 perfect cakes, she has to burn a few... after MA's untouchable past they finally stumble and fall. this album is pure filler, just some filtered beats over a whiney white chick singing.. nothing catchy, nothing deep; just filler and a kick drum.. maybe there was some talent in that trickey cat after all."
3,ditto to dan,"Eh. Massive says ""Dont be afraid to open your mouth and say."" So I say, this is one dissapointing cd. Boring. Nothing stands out very much. I couldnt pick a track to play on my radio show. Dunno. I was listening to it and it faded in to the background as waves of bass and sound, soothing and a little hypnotizing. The effects on the vocals (not sinead's) were way over done. It certainly terrible in the car, you feel like pulling over to the side of the road and going to sleep. I dont know. All I can think of is fart noises when people ask me what I think of this album. Go buy royksopp or funki porcini instead."
1,Dropped the hop from trip hop - only 1/3 of the attack,"Disappointing after all the wait. A sad day for fans. This album is boring.Most importantly, two of the main songwriters from their previous albums, Marshall and Vowles, are glaringly missing.This is not Massive attack. It is the Robert Del Naja and Sinead O'Connor show.No more of the smooth laid back rapping style that I loved from their previous albums. It suffers from a lack of variety opting for a more consistent (read: monotonous) sound throughout. Where are the guitars or the energy of previous releases?Sinead and Gabriel = Good. Sinead and Massive = Bad.Her ""Prayer for England"" is the worst track to ever bear the Massive Attack monicker."
5,Dark and darker,"I remember hoping with a friend some years back that the Massive Attack should really hook up with Sinead O'Connor and Peter Gabriel.With this album, we're half way there. O'Connor's vocals are a natural fit ... just like previous MA discs, they seem to have impeccable taste in finding talent and integrating it into their own efforts.""A Prayer for England"" & ""Antistar"" standout on first listen. With each successive listen, though, the individual tracks fade into the background and the overall mood emerges. Similar to Mezzanine but less bombastic, more lithe and insinuating.This disc almost comes across like a soundtrack, integrated and visceral.Makes me think I should reconsider the ultimate line-up for the next MA album: substitute Brian Eno for Peter Gabriel, add Sinead, Tracey Thorne and Elisabeth Frazier."
2,A Let Down,"After a long wait, we get an album that seems very bland. The instruments drone on and over the voices. Everything has a bland feel to it. Not what I had come to expect from MAssive Attack"
4,Awesome but not life altering,"90% of this album is incredible. The arrangements are eerie and haunting and really well produced. The only track that I will ever be skipping when listening to this album is track 2, ""What Your Soul Sings"". The vocals are obtrusive on this track in my opinion and detract from its otherwise solid composition. If you like Massive Attack, or even if you have never even heard of Massive Attack and you are just interested in trip hop, you need to pick this album up, put it in the CD player, turn the lights out, and shut your eyes. This is why Massive is one of the only groups that I get excited about."
3,Set aside your expectations. . .,"Imagine that 3D's name was on this, and not Massive Attack, because this is, after all, a solo album. Now imagine if the second and third songs were located further back, or removed.I think that, laden with expectations and bummed out by the prospect of waiting ANOTHER 5 years for the next MA disc, I gave this CD the same indifferent reception that others did. However, having set aside those expectations, I like it a lot more.Yes, this doesn't have the weight and impact of Mezzanine, but as a set of brooding, ephemeral pieces it beats a host of lesser efforts. (Though one shouldn't, I think, evaluate music comparatively.) They have long since crossed over from soul/funk/trip-hop into electronica, with its requisite darkness and brooding, but I find it as satisfying as ever.Massive Attack remains, at least for now, (all the more since Leftfield have broken up) my favorite band in the world.Now back to work, you two!"
4,moving forward = changes = growth,"I've read some of the other reviews. I must say that it surprises me each time that so many people look for the same things over and over again. In this case they want another ""Mezzanine"". But it can't be... simply because it's a new album. Massive Attack has moved on in life and so is their music. Please stop comparing this album to other ones! It only prevents you from seeing the simple beauty in all of the songs. Allow it some time to flood you. You'll be a richer person for it !"
3,100th Window,"Massive Attack's 100th Window feels like good a follow up to their astonishing album Mezzanine. With this album being their release almost five years after Mezzanine, I was feeling a lot of anticipation when waiting for the album. When I was listening to this album for the first time, I was very pleased with the the first two tracks, Future Proof and What Your Soul Sings. However, after those tracks passed there was not much left but long, slow, repetitive guitar tunes. Only to break this cycle were the vocals of Sinead O' Connor on the track Special Cases. Clear standouts on this album are, Future Proof, What Your Soul Sings, and A Prayer For England. Other than those three tracks, 100th Window did not show the full potential of Massive Attack. I give it three stars."
3,Not as bad as you'd expect,"After hearing the stupendous Mezzanine, I bought their two other CD's, Blue Lines and Protection. I was impressed with all three, with Mezzanine being the best of the bunch. So, like many other fans, I eagerly waited for the release of 100th Window. After listening to it at least several times, well, all I can say is that it's NOT bad. In fact, all nine tracks are decent to say the least. The whole CD reminds me more of background music for a chillout session or a soundtrack to a sci-fi movie set in some cold, dark distant future. 3D's collaborations with Horace Andy and Sinead O'Connor add nicely to this collection. However, in my humble opinion, if both Daddy Gee and Mushroom were still in the band, this would've been a far better disc. Again, this is not a bad disc at all. If you want to be more familiar with MA, start with Mezzanine and work backwards. *** 1/2"
4,One of my faves,"I really enjoy listening to this album while I'm sitting back and chilling out. Its really good to wind down to. My favorite song is the second one but the entire album is very good. My only complaint is that after a while of listening the songs kind of blend together. Which is good and bad depending on the mood I'm in. Anyway if you're into ""trip-hop"" this cd will not dissapoint. I do feel though some people have rated it 5 stars because its Massive Attack.."
3,Lost Their Edge,"I loved Mezzanine. I'm a bit disappointed with ""100th Window"". It's not bad, but it does not have the awesome heavy edge Mezzanine had. Many songs have a great beat - but don't really go anywhere. They have also lost a key singer from Mezzanine. I'll keep it - but three stars."
2,A tremendous disappointment from MA,"I'm a big fan of Massive Attack, and their three previous albums each have a distinct flavor, and addictive quality. This one is just flat, dull, and repetitive. Most bands burn out after a while, and I'm sad to say that this seems to have happened for MA. I hope that I'm wrong, and that they bounce back, but 100th Window is a big letdown. Not terrible, but certainly not up to their usual standards. 100th Window may appeal to some (it reminds me vaguely of Radiohead, whom I also find dull but others like). It's definitely different from earlier MA albums, and the first monotonous, boring album they've done. I'm all for change, but not just plain giving up."
3,"Well, lets be honest...","Well, lets be honest...I like Massive Attack a lot.But ... 100th Window will not be no landmark for the future.I think, really, that this work was thought more as a burden by them, then a new intense desire of creating superb artwork (as usual).Well, lets wait for the next..."
3,A good album...but not great,"I'd definately agree with the aforementioned reviews which state that the previous MA album this isn't. That album is great through and through. This album has a few great moments but they're caught in a web of uncertainty, which brings me to my primary beef with this record...it just doesn't feel finished.Perhaps that was intentional. After all, the previous album's songs were self-contained units that could be taken individually or as a whole. With this album, it's really about the sum of the parts, not the parts per say. ""What your soul sings"", ""Future Proof"", and the last track are the standouts. Others, while good, aren't great. With this album you get the impression that MA is trying to take their sound in a new direction: colder, more enigmatic, less obvious trip-hop. That's fine, but I'm not sure MA really completed what they set out to and as such, the album feels (and sounds) half-realized."
2,"I'm a big fan, but...","Recently I heard a journalist talking about Massive Attack. She said what we all know which is that they were ground breaking, combining dark beats and lilting vocals with reggae and other influences.Blue Lines and Protection shaped a generation of artists and turned my world upside down.But that was then...Now Del Naja without his co-founders seems a bit one dimensional. The depth and variation isn't there.Checkout Theivery Corporation's 'Richest Man in Babylon' instead."
3,Put us in a dangerous trance....,"When on a road trip we popped this cd in at about 10 in the morning.....way too early! This cd was too dark and moody for a fun vacation.This is a good cd, its not the best that Massive Attack has done but I still enjoyed it.However I think it would be best listened to at night while doing something a little naughty. You can decide what naughty is for you."
1,Background Music,"Massive Attack's 100th Window is trip-hop without the hip-hop. Better known for their spooky atmospherics than for their beats, they give up all pretense to dance culture and go for the ambient chill crowd. Problem is, without the underlay of terror that's driven their best tracks (""Angel"", ""Protection""), there's not much there there. Not that these songs aren't scary - the lyrics are full of forbidding images - but that the music is, at its most propulsive, tinkling and comforting. Sinead O'Connor pops up on a few tracks; she's the trance dance diva du jour and, much as I love her voice, she's a stone bore. Horace Andy's lovely lilt does what it can to prop up a few okay songs. Otherwise, it's background music. Hopefully, for a place you never set foot in."
4,Possibly too dark...,"If you come looking for a simple, happy set of tunes, don't! This time Massive Attack have teamed up with Sinhead O'Connor, whacky Irish artist, and in places it becomes downright depressing. It can be a grower, but if you want to get into Massive Attack, do it chronologically!"
2,A Heretic Speaks...,"Am I a heretic to suggest that this is their worst output?! Honest to god, the only good cut here is the one featuring Sinéad O'Connor, ""What Your Soul Sings."" But when they try to use her twice, it turns into another tedious soundscape, as in ""Prayer For England."" And speaking of tedious soundscapes, the repetitiveness of these meagre songs starts to blot out your consciousness after a very short time!If you like ""What Your Soul Sings,"" I would suggest doing what I did, and that's purchasing Sinéad's new CD, ""She Who Dwells."" There are a lot more songs like ""Soul Sings"" than ""Prayer For England."" In fact, there are dubby gems arranged by Massive Attack (""It's All Good""), influenced by Massive Attack (""Love is Ours""), and some outright brilliance on the part of Asian Dub Foundation. ""She Who Dwells"" actually sounds like ""Mezzanine""!Guess we'll have to find our Massive Attack in other places from now on."
2,Mezzanine ll,"After listening to this cd,I wonder,why did I buy this?,I guess,because I'm a fan and I though that Massive Attack wouldn't let me down.But 100th Windows is exactly like Mezzanine,except that all the songs sound exactly the same,it is hard to remember which song is which,same instruments,same rhythm,same voice.Also the brooding thing is fantastic,if you don't overdo it.This cd is too dark and oppresive,not what I was expecting in a band that is always evolving.Oh,well,maybe next time..."
2,Not worthy of the Massive Attack name,"The quality of this release is merely ok. It has an unrefined or unfinished feel to it. The album is like one long track with decent, yet monotone beats. Nothing much makes any of the individual tracks stand out from each other. This creates a good but unremarkable ambience. I can't imagine any noteworth uses for this release.*A major defect is the vocals, which really do not fit with the music. At times, the vocals feel forced, and distract from otherwise good tracks.Massive Attack fans who are familar with Mezzanine will be disappointed by the lack of quality in 100th Window. Some hardcore fans may still appreciate this work. Since I originally wrote this review, time has proven that this CD is a very unremarkable and forgetable release. Tracks from Mezzanine are often played, and used in movies and TV, etc. Nothing from 100th Window gets any play or usage. Nuf'said!Recommendation: Don't buy"
4,works pretty well in Linux 2.4,"After much effort, I did finally get this card to work reliably with Linux. It is an ne2000 clone. I had to tweak a few settings (turn off Plug N Pray in the bios, specify interrupt and address space), but Slackware now has no problem with it - I just wish it was capable of 100BT."
5,saiyuki is excellent!,saiyuki is a great action show. A tiny bit of humor now and then is a great show by me.
4,Zareba Electric Fence for Squirrel damage mitigation,"I was looking at ways to prevent the squirrels from eating my garden fruits and vegetables and thought I try an electric fence. I didn't want to kill them, didn't want to use poisons, had tried scaring them, throwing stuff at them, urine-marking, using a road-kill squirrel to deter them... and NOTHING worked. This electric fence was cheap and extremely easy to erect around my garden. After an iteration or two of defining the boundary (the squirrels found ways through a few times), I had 100% success with keeping the squirrels out. They even seemed to learn that the white electric fence rope meant ""stay away"" because sometimes I would forget to turn it on and they didn't come back. Whereas before, they would come back every 30 mins. Good fence, good price."
4,zareba electric fence,"This electric fence successfully protected our garden, which in previous years had been ravaged by raccoons. This year, our corn, squash, and grapes were untouched. As evidence of its success, we found one morning a disturbed section of grapevines where a raccoon had likely fallen after encountering an electrified wire we had strung atop the fence in which the grapevine was entwined. It seems that the shock had frightened the raccoon to such an extent that it never returned. It is easy to set up and use. The only ""downside"" of the kit is that no hook-up wire is included, which seems essential in order to properly set up the fence. I suspect that this is due to the cost of the hook-up wire, which I bought (50 feet) for about half the price of the kit. Would I have bought the kit (for $20 more) if the wire had been included? Maybe not; so I understand why the manufacturer did not include it."
1,not all there is,Bought this kit to keep our puppy out of our garden. Having a kit seems nice only problem it does not have all the parts you need. In order to use this fence outside you have to have a 20thousand volt wire which the company is more than willing to ship for 19.64 plus S$H. Not such a great deal after all. Their company service was not at all helpful and very rude. Take it from me and save time and money and buy a little more expensive fence.
3,Works but trips my GFCI frequently,"The product is working to protect my garden from chipmunks, squirrels and rabbits. The only downside is that it is tripping my GFCI every day or two."
3,Easy to set up,"Appears at first not to work, because you cant see the power lite unless its dark out. I had a cat digging in my garden every nite. Next morning after I put it up I seen two paw prints and a big scratch out where he must have hit the wire. That cat has not left a foot print in the garden since. So figured it might work to keep the neighbors do from digging under the back fence, so went to our farm supply store and got a roll of elec fence wire and added it into the system. So far so good.I didnt run a seperate ground wire or put in a ground rod as it says you dont have to. Seems to do the job. Dan"
2,flimsy and missing a wire,"I have used electric fences on my gardens before so I was excited to find this kit on Amazon! Once the package was opened I realized that the product was on the flimsy side for an electric fence. The directions called for a 20,000 volt wire which was not included in the kit. I took the directions to Ace Hardware for the wire and they had no idea what kind of wire the directions were calling for. I then took the directions and kit to home depot. Same answer. I called an electrician friend to assist and he could not get it to work with any kind of wire. The plastic posts were not strong enough and there were too few clips to do more than 2 rows. This would definitely not keep my cat out of the garden let alone large iguanas!I am returning it and hope to find something of better quality at Amazon."
1,Not Good,I returned this product. I thought it was very inhumane to my animals and I would not use it. It did exactly what it said it should do but not for my pets.
3,Love it but my hair almost all pulled out.,"Man, what a fun game. That is until the computer decides thatyou will lose no matter what. Case in point I made it through three complete divisions with a mediocre team. I found a defense for each opponent and coupled with a strong run game and a dink and dunk pass strategy was able to win.Until that is I met the Denver Broncos. I cannot win no matter what I do. No defense works, I'm up 20 - 0 they win anyway.To echo the other comments, when the CPU needs a turnover, your great running back turns into fumblina. All passes get intercepted, you can't stop their run attack and they pitch four times to win games. This one is going back unfortunately, It is just too frustrating to be fun anymore."
4,nfl street rocks,"when i first saw this game i wanted if i had to camp out over night to get it. mayb a week or so a later my dad bought it for me when i got home and played it i couldn't get away from it i was like addicted. anyway, this is very good for people who like sports consisting of football(especially), or any sports so if u like sports and sports video games this game is for you. its great"
3,A little too hard.,"I have been an EA fan for many years, and have recently purchased an XBOX. After experiencing all the hype about NFL Street, I decided to make it my next purchase. After two hours of play, I was utterly frustrated. This game is impossible! I am not a hard core gamer, and even though the controls are simple enough, the game is just to difficult. It has way too many fumbles and turn overs, and when you are just about to win, the computer pulls off some amazing move, like a triple interception to win the game. The graphics are great and the team edit mode is sweet, but if your playing solo please be prepared to slam your controller down in frustration."
3,I'm sure it would have been good and the shipping would have been fast but...,"...I didn't do all of the right research for the game I bought, and found out that it couldn't play on the Xbox 360, which was very disappointing, and now I am trying to return it."
3,Frustratingly addicting,"The disappointing thing is that this game could have been so much better. At times, it feels incredibly frustrating and pointless. Lack of variety gets boring after a while. However, I am unable to put it down. Sounds confusing? I guess I just keep hoping it will get better. Definitly would not buy this, however, it makes for a very good rent."
1,2 Player Only,"If you are going to play against a human, then this is an OK game. If you are going to play against the computer, forget it. This is a 'throw the controller down' frustrating type of game. Just about the point you are going to win, the computer comes up with some quadruple lateral for the score, and then follows with the triple tip interception to win the game. It's ridiculous. It's not fun. Please don't discount my review based on game playing abilities. I played NBA Street all the way through. Every scenario.I waited for months for the release of NFL Street - and bottom line is, it was not ready. EA should be ashamed to put their name on this product.Please read reviews from people who have actually ""played"" the game. Too many reviews are based on the hype. Great hype - Poor gameplay."
4,sweer,"THIS GAME ISK ABSOLUTLEY AMAZING. tHE nfl CHALLENGE IS HOURS OF FUN, ESPECIALLY THE END WHEN IT GETS HARDER. PUT SIMPLY THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE!!!!"
1,Terrible,"Not fit to be mentioned in the same breath as the excellent NBA Street Vol 2. Unresponsive control, dull game modes, no rhyme or reason to excecuting the style moves, you fumble every five seconds, on and on. Not worth 20 bucks, much less 50."
1,Sucks,"This game blows bigtime, the graphics are crappy, and the gameplay is limited. There are barely any playbook plays and the gameplay is stiff, and repetitive. Oooohhh big deal I can play as the Fridge, who cares make the game good EA. Do not waste your fifty dollers!!"
3,Philip Seymour Hoffman is a genius,"I will keep this simple. See this movie because you must see every movie that Philip Seymour Hoffman has appeared in. I first experienced him in ""Happiness,"" and I don't remember when I have been so deeply disgusted by a character. It was a difficult movie to watch and it was very refreshing to see that Philip could play a light and funny character like the drag queen in Flawless. The chemistry between Philip and Robert DeNiro is touching and surprising. See it."
3,SEYMOUR HOFFMAN IS FLAWLESS,"There is one reason and one reason only to see this film and that is the heartbreaking tour de force put on by Seymour Hoffman. He is fantastic in this part of a f**ked up Drag Queen and his interaction with a homophobic stroke victim, Deniro, there is another diverging story of stock Hollywood psychos, in pursuit of something they think Hoffman posseses, but it's really the interaction between Hoffman and Deniro that resonates and makes this film worth viewing. I appreciated how Hoffman played this character, like he really knew her/him, and there is one scene that will stay with me forever, it's just wrenching to watch..anyway, enjoy!!.."
4,"Funny movie, more entertaining than I imagined","Originally found out about the movie because Daphne Rubin-Vega and Wilson Jermaine Heredia of RENT are in it. And of course while Wilson makes the only really convincing drag queen, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, really stole the movie most of the time. He was so fun and believable. Of course, on the other end of the spectrum, I was not too thrilled with Robert DeNiro. I suppose that is just my experience with paralysis patients making me a bit too judgmental about the little things. He's a great actor in my opinion, this might just not have been the role for him. Also, their storyline was great, but the money storyline they always went back to was a little boring but I guess it was necessary. Overall, a good buy and worth it. But the RENT-head inside my heart screams for more Cha-Cha screen time ;)"
4,Flawless,This is DeNiro at his best. Philip Seymour Hoffman in fact gives a flawless performance in his role as female impersonator/tutor to a stricken DeNiro. The writing is excellent. Lots of humor and action.
3,This movie can only be viewed satisfactorily if you do not take it seriously,"Nothing about this film happens in real life. A cop with no tolerance for drag queens doesn't suddenly find himself dancing with them at a party. Gay republicans, I doubt, act like they are anything but gay and work feverishly to undermine there own lifestyle. And a ""tough as nails"" hero cop, probably doesn't go from hating those ""m----r f-----g"" fags to singing along with one : ""bannana manna, bo bana, fee fi fo fana, etc. etc. etc. There is lots here to force you to stretch your imagination beyond what a film of its genre would ask you to do. Speaking of genre - hmmmm, suspenseful comedic drama....that seems to sum it up. Maybe this film trys to be too many things. Then again, it does have it's moments. DeNiro is always fun to watch and Hoffman does have a few really funny one liners. Hoffman is way over the top with his character."
2,Has been done better,"Yes, it has been done better, as it was in As Good as It Gets, which is much funnier and probably truer to life. Most of the drag queens in this are plastic characters. Even DeNiro seems plastic. The suspense part of it is seems to have just been thrown in as an excuse for violence and action of a sort. I would say, don't waste your time, see AGAIG, with which you also get the very wonderful Helen Hunt."
1,Weird,"I don't often turn off a movie, but after twenty minutes both my wife and I looked at each other and said ""I told you not to rent this!"". Men in dresses...dark rooms...no plot...bad acting...cliches... rubbish! Don't waste your money. When I logged on to write a review to this movie I noticed it had received some very high ratings and initally I assumed that there must be two movies called 'flawless' but there aren't...different tastes I suppose and we are all free to comment. But I suspect that if you are straight, don't like transvestites and think Robert DeNero is an excellent actor then don't rent this movie."
5,A subtle favorite,"I first saw this on cable about 8 years ago.I love the ""feel"" of this movie.Both Robert De Niro and Phillip Seymour Hoffman give wonderful performances. The entire supporting cast are excellent as well.I love the scene between the ""drag queens"" and the gay republicans."
4,An Oscar for De Niro,"This movie is not exactly your typical Hollywood factory trash, it's a movie that shows substance. In one flick, to deal with issues such as social decline, racism, gay movements and being handicapped (brilliantly performed by DeNiro), is a true achievement. It's a movie that makes you think, no matter how ""anti"" anything you may be - it shows you that in the end if you strip away the fassade everybody is just the same: a human being with feelings and needs. Great performance also by Philip Seymour Hoffman."
3,Surprisingly mediocre for these actors,"I found this movie categorized under comedy on Netflix, but it's hardly a comedy. More like a dramedy. The whole drug deal/money thing in the plot line is confusing at best, and really detracts from what otherwise could've been a cute story. The whole thing, however, is just so unbelievable, it takes a lot of imagination to put aside the obvious problems with the story. It's almost like it was a longer movie that got chopped down to a small one. And there's just no way a homophobic guy like DeNiro's character will hook up with the drag queen for singing lessons.....it'd never happen."
5,Flawless!,"This one doesn't miss a beat and, if you can get past the wild premise (Former homophobic cop leans on and befriends ans out drag queen) then you're in for a treat! Philip Seymore Hoffman as the drag queen and Roberts De Niro? You couldn't ask for better and they make it work. It's warm,sentimental,funny and very observingstudy,not only how really similar we are but how our differences can be enriching"
3,Acting is the key to this film!,"Philip Seymore Hoffman does a BRILLIANT acting job in this film, even outshining Robert De Niro. This movie is about tolerance and accepting people for who they are. The message is good, and the film, while a bit slow at times, is worth the watch just to see Philip Hoffman's poignant portrayal of a tormented drag queen."
3,acting was good,"Well by no means was this a great movie. The worst thing about it was trying to understand the two main characters. I understand about the Robert DeNiro character with his speech problem. I sure would not have picked this drag queen to give me speech lessons. Don't get me wrong, the acting by Philip Seymour Hoffman is what carried this movie. I can see why they chose Hoffman to play ""Capote"". He can play any role. It was a little disjointed but I enjoyed it for the acting alone."
3,Not a drag,"Joel Schumacher's formulaic feel-good comedy-drama is much more affecting and entertaining than it has any right to be. Philip Seymour Hoffman (""Magnolia,"" ""State and Main"") gives an inspired performance as Rusty, a chunky drag queen who helps a homophobic ex-security guard (Robert De Niro) recover from a debilitating stroke. The convention of rendering a drag queen as an outspoken Earth Mother is not exactly fresh. But Hoffman infuses Rusty with enough vitality - and, when necessary, enough ferocity - to turn the overexposed cliché back into a flesh-and-blood character. Indeed, he even manages to overshadow De Niro -- no mean feat!"
2,Stereotypes Galore,"Choppy direction, a ridiculous script, and horrible stereotypes are the things that even Deniro and Hoffman cannot overcome. Hoffman appears to be doing his best Nathan Lane imitation throughout, but there is no Robin Williams to play off of. There's only a bored Deniro, who needs to research the affect of stroke on its victims a little more. And what is up with these drug dealers? (don't ask, and don't waste your time with this film)"
3,Over the top and bizzar,"The movie was enjoyable and entertaining. I felt that most stereotypes got used a great deal and that the story was a bit strange. De Niro did an excellant job of being an old dog that hates new tricks and hates Gays. His role was believable and his vocal trainer ( Drag Queen ) was totally over the top but since I have known a few that are just as over the top as him, I was able to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the film. The film quality was good and it had some good comic moments. I realize that the message was meant to be deep however I felt the movie was lacking soul. I never got drawn in to the point I forgot it was a movie, not even for a few minutes. It's an enjoyable movie for an evening sitting in front of the tube but not one you would strongly suggest friends rent or see particularly. I very much enjoy De Niro and wish I could be more possitive and up beat about my review however I can not with all honesty."
4,Fun,Great for people getting back into exercise. Makes exercise fun and if you like it you will do it. Price was also right. Look forward to purchasing additional videos from Billy Blanks jr.
5,Fantastic Fun while excercising,"I never knew exercising could be so much fun!! The music and learning dance moves is so much fun and I am really working out! Billy and Sharon are absolutely AMAZING,"
2,It's Boring. Dancing Shouldn't Be Boring. It's DANCING.,"I wanted a dance workout since we got rid of our Wii and JustDance 2 (*sob*), and this one looked like one of the few that I would be comfortable watching/working out to in front of my 5 and 2 year old sons. The girls aren't dressed like strippers and the moves aren't like MTV videos. So those points are great. The instructor Billy Blanks is fine, but the rest of the crowd is embarrassingly annoying. And the dances are way too boring, and there is WAY too much talking. There should be an instructional video for beginners, and then the option to do a dance-only, no instruction video when you're ready to move on. Instead, they offer a ""music only"" video that is just the original video but they play music over the talking. Yikes.I wish JustDance offered a workout DVD. I'm going to keep looking for that."
3,not as intense,"Thought I was buying the Dance With Me that Billy Blanks has on Exercise TV. This one was not as intense, and I like the other one better"
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this workout. It seemed too easy and low impact for me. I am used to high impact aerobics and I've been dancing for 22 years, I guess I thought it would be more intense since it's Billy Blanks Jr. The dances were way too easy for me and I didn't break a sweat even after doing the dvd the whole way through. I would recommend this for beginners or for low impact, but this is not challenging at all for a seasoned dancer or someone used to high impact routines."
2,Creepy,"I really didn't like this video. Billy Blanks Jr. and his wife are just a little too corny to me. I guess I am more in to the style of Jillian Michaels, who is completely saccharin free. You can sweat a little, but I would rather it be straight forward working out. Billy Blanks Jr.'s wife is not doing him any favors, I find her extra annoying."
4,Dance with Me Cardio Fit,"I was looking for some exercise options and I chose because it provided what I needed. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for exercise options at a great price, ease to follow the program and enough flexibility not to get bored with trying to improve my health and burn off some calories."
3,Minimum sweat,"This is a fun workout video, but not much of a workout. Billy Blanks Jr. and his wife are pretty fun to workout with, though."
5,5-Stars,"Great product and service in getting the DVD to me. I like Billy Blanks, Jr., and especially like his story of branching out on his own, away from his father. Great seller!"
4,A good cardio workout,"Billy Blanks Jr. gives you a good cardio workout with this video. Some of the dances can be trickier than others, and you may want to be alone or with others that you don't mind laughing at yourself with when doing this the first few times. I think that it may become tiresome after a while though when you've been doing it for a while since it seems to be geared towards someone just starting out with it. You can watch it without the talking, but it's the same thing with his voice muted. It would be nice to have the dances without his instructions where you don't still see his lips talking and hands gesturing at what he's saying."
4,Just like his dad,"I love the video since one session is only 10 minutes. Good to do this in the morning. Hope there are more types of dance.Also almost all the video like this, I don't enjoy the mucic."
4,So Much Fun,"Exercising can be fun...try this DVD. It's all dance, easy to follow steps and you feel like you are in the class.This is for the beginner/intermediate or the very fit person who just needs something light. It's definitely a keeper."
4,Grown Folk Music,"I am not a blues aficionado but I really like this cd. The best song on here in my opinion is Ship Made of Paper. My mother caught me singing this song one time and just shook her head because it is an old spirit song.Other great songs on here are Screaming Jay's Whammy and Cat Blues. They take you back to when the Blues was real big and people would sing because of the way they felt, versus singing just to make some money. One of the songs I couldn't feel because it is based upon something not practiced in my family, ""Come on in this House"" but it is reflective of the culture and the time.I think it is a great cd that is reflective of true hoodoo culture, even though there isn't a whole lot of mention about hoodoo.Hope this was helpful."
2,don't do non-stick,"This pot is not the greatest. I've had mine a few years, and I've had little satisfaction from the non-stick feature. I thought it rather quickly lost its non-stick benefit, even with careful washing and treatment. Also, the lid design makes it hard to set the lid on a little to the side for letting steam escape. The lid just comes sliding back full onto the pot. You have to stick a spoon or something in the pan to keep the lid cocked. And watch out when you are washing the lid, it tends to spray water out of the sink if you're not holding it down low enough. The main thing, though, is that non-stick coatings never seems to stick long. I always wish I had gone with non-coated stainless so I can use scouring pads and steel spatulas; cleanup is eventually actually quicker. Just get uncoated stainless and use a little oil; stainless isn't all THAT sticky."
2,The SB-104 kit is slow for networking.,Sharing 2 computers and a printer seemed to be too much for this kit. Everytime I transferred files to-and-from my computers I had collisions occur. It was an inconvenience when I wanted to print out documents while updating files on both computers. I learned that having a switch instead of a hub eliminates these delays.
3,"Pretty, but not exactly as pictured","These are nice, small earrings, but they don't look quite as nice as shown. The stones I got had more green in them and they lacked the black marks. As a result, I would probably think they were enamel and not real turquoise if I saw them on someone (though I have no reason to think that they are actually fake). Also, the stone is only on one side.Like I said, they're still nice earrings. The person I gave them to still loved them and I don't regret buying them."
5,Zen master Barrington Bayley,"An entertaining and absorbing romp through space aboard a battle class pleasure ship in search of the ultimate weapon. While developing a new space drive, humans have accidentally torn a hole in space, annoying nearby aliens, and inadvertently releasing strange creatures who mold matter indisciminately. As a human-primate chimera and his samurai escort quest for the power of the zen gun, intelligent animals threaten to take control of the empire. Even though the moon is falling from the sky, and the robots are on strike, there is always time for a brief physics lesson or two. Barrington J. Bayley is not only a great storyteller, he is also a master of the English language."
5,Brilliant but eclectic,"Perhaps not for everyone, but I found this book to be fresh, complex, humorous, and fast-paced. And hidden in with the pure zaniness is some depth, like how old and powerful empires decay, and the dynamics of conflict when one side has polished and perfected tactics, and the other fresh energy but is in a desperate race to learn the rules before being crushed.... It's all thrown together into a giant pile but for me it works."
2,"Boring, bizarre and bogus","There's good science fiction and then there's bad science fiction. Unfortunately The Zen Gun belongs in the latter category. The story is a mixture of all sorts of ideas: genetic engineering, an intergalactic empire in decline, talking animals, a strange zen gun with an ominous purpose...There's plenty of imaginative space opera action and it all moves pretty swiftly, but at the same time the whole story is confusing and bounces from place to place. Parts of The Zen Gun are pertty good, but the most of it doesn't really work that well.Add to that some very bizarre and boring pseudoscientific lectures on the nature of the universe and you'll end up with a fairly pointless book. I recommend skipping this one; if you decide to read it, fortunately it's very short. (Review based on the Finnish translation.)"
5,Step back in time,"Dr. Atalay was the most influencial teacher in my life. He taught me to look at physics from a whole new perspective. I remember the stories and relationships that he taught me. For me, this book was a step back in time. Now I am teaching my own group of students about the history and theory of math and science. This book will be a essential component to my class. I look forward to introducing the next generation of Dr. Atalay's work."
3,Densely Packed with Interesting Information,"The title of this book is a bit of a misnomer. The main focus of this work is a very comprehensive and interesting history of math and science from Aristarchus to Einstein. Granted, additional emphasis is placed on Leonardo da Vinci and the impact science has upon art, but a reader interested in an in depth treatment of either may be left disappointed. The authors view that Leonardo is a scientist first and artist second is quite intriguing. In the end though, the pace of this book was quite frantic and the author tries to cover too much material.If you are interested in a more compact and readable history of science, I would recommend Mlodinow's ""Euclid's Window"".If you are interested in learning more about Leonardo, no one does it better than his contemporary Giorgio Vasari in the classic ""Lives of the Artists"".Finally, if you are interested in learning more about the wonders of the Golden Ratio, then Livio's ""Golden Ratio"" is the gold standard."
4,This was a great book to learn the beginnings of wrestling.,"Sharon did a great job subjecting herself to the cruelty of the life and times of the professional wrestlers. I would like to see her come out with a newer book, and maybe look back at the wrestler's that she met when she was at Gleason's Gym. I think all the skeptics of professional wrestling should do exactly what Ms. Mazer did and learn the real facts about professional wrestling, or at least read her book. I am glad to see Sharon learned a lot from doing this book and it could teach a lot of skeptics out there about the real truth of professional wrestling."
2,Snoozer of a book not even for the hardcore fan,This book is written from a scholarly standpoint. I have a doctorate degree and LOVE wrestling. I figured this would be an insightful book but it was not. This author wrote this book as a thesis for her doctorate and that is where it should have stayed and out of print. Larry Nelson's book was better than this and that is saying a lot. If you are the type of person who has to read everything on wrestling then get it otherwise find your kayfabe fix elsewhere.
5,A decade of spectacular music composed in Rome,"The period 1703 - 1713, in Rome, was fascinating for the ingenuity of the composers working there. Staged operas were deemed unacceptable for public viewing by the Pope, so the composers living there turned to oratorio. The results, as sung by Cecilia Bartoli and played by the Musiciens du Louvre (Marc Minkowski) are endearing, full of invention, creativity, and delight. They may be new to the ear on first hearing, but a purchaser will want to play them over and over again!"
4,Utterly sublime,"I am not a big Bartoli-Fan but I'm always intrigued by the oddities she digs up. And IMHO this is a clear winner among recitals. She sails through the difficult fioritura with flying flags while also giving drama & meaning to the text. One thing I do not like is the Bartoli-yelp in some of the fioritura. Her trill is also unsteady at times in slow pieces. But with arias as difficult as these it would be nipicky to harp on little flaws. Yes, Cecilia Bartoli has grown indeed and I hope that there'll be many more albums as good as this one."
4,The Best. Thanks Cecilia!,"This may be the best Bartoli CD in recent years!!! No recent album of her thrilled me like this new one. I have the feeling of already being catched by the CD's arias and that didn't happen with the Salieri, Gluck, etc, albums, despite their obvious beauty.For the voice, this album reminds me of the sheer energy of Rossini Heroines.So why my 4 stars? Never seen such ugly pictures of her! Were they making a pic of her nostrils, or what?"
2,Bartoli,"After listening to this, I would not recommend it to the casual listener. A very odd and certainly different vocal selections. Still not one of my favorite singers."
1,Spanish Version Missing Chapters,I give this 1 star because this Spanish Version is missing chapters that are in the English version. Also some of the chapters are cut short in the Spanish Version. I love the book and give it 5 stars but not this incomplete version. Now I need to try and find an older more complete edition in Spanish.
5,my experience,I ordered the book and the description said it was in good conditions. Once i got it I was surprised the book was like new. It even seemed no-one had use it ever. I t was in great condition and great price. I am really happy with my book. I'll try to keep buying with you guys!!!!! thanks
1,"Extensive, Yes... Useless, Mostly...","So... Where to begin? Within the first three chapters, we have definitions like:""Hypothesis are conjectures or guesses at the solutions or answers to a problem or situation.""""A control variable is an independent variable other than the independent variable of primary interest whose effects are determined by the researcher, and included in the analysis in order to get a clearer picture of the effects of the primary independent variable.""If you can understand this, by all means, get this book. The authors REALLY need a professional editor, and not some grad assistant doing it for them. It is poorly written and very difficult to understand without a teacher guiding you through the theories. I have never encountered these types of theories before in the undergraduate level, so being thrown into these types of explanations are very difficult and completely illegible.Unacceptable for the price paid."
2,Puccini: Turandot,"It is only OK since this is the only Turandot on Blu-ray. Yes, BBC Music magazine and Blu-ray.com give this one a 4 of 5 stars review. Except for 1080i and DTS-HD sound, the performance is just OK, nothing special. I would take Mazzal's Vienna production or Levine's Met performance in a heart beat. But since both of them are on DVD only, there is no choice if you really need to see the logo of DTS-HD being shown on your receicer screen throughout the performance as it was my original intention to try it out in the first place. But if you don't care about being trendy, stay with Eva Marton on DVD instead."
2,Park and Bark!,"While the soprano does a wonderful job of the technical part of singing, the acting is much less to be desired. The tenor shows no evidence that he knows what he's singing about--your typical walk on stage, stand there, and sing. This was not the best cast I've seen.The sets and the stage/lighting design were exquisite however."
3,Hot Handle,"Although I like the shape and size of this pan, the handle gets incredibly hot. I have other Cuisinart pans that this doesn't happen with."
4,Nice product adds finished look to fireplace,"This metal fireplace screen is perfect for my gas fireplace! I did not need the functional ability of a screen front, but rather I required a decorative finishing touch to my fireplace. The best features of this screen are: 1. You can see the fire nicely through the open decoration; 2. It's narrow profile allows it to fit snuggly to the hearth, leaving room for my baskets, vase, etc. The mixed color finish is actually nicer than I thought it might be. I had originally planned to repaint the finish sold black, but once the screen arrived I decided I liked the mixed colors better!"
4,"Nice, affordable screen","Overall, this fireplace screen is pretty good. It came packaged well and is a good value for the money. The picture of the product is a tad misleading as the colors are a bit more bold then they appear. The center ornament is actually antique silver and quite shiny. The leaves are a bolder green then shown in the picture. Don't expect to receive something that is wholly dark antique brown."
2,Very poor finishing techniques.,"The antique finish was extremely inferior. Each area has a different color, which would be fine but the quality of the finishes is awful. I would not have ordered if I had known. Other than that, the workmanship is good."
2,poor quality,"I am disapointed in the quality of this item. The picture is not representaive of the true color. The metal is tinny , especially the leaves. It looks like something that should only cost about half of what it does cost."
5,has an old world look,"Couldn't wait until it came easy to install, and looks the part of antique works well in my home and I just love the item will make everyone go say wow."
1,Not So Good,"Thought I would really like this screen, but the painted green was horrible, plus the holes for the feet did not line up. I was going to paint over the terrible green color, but could not get it put together. Poor workmanship and quality...it was returned. purchased another one."
4,Tanya rocks,This is a must for Tanya Steves fans! She is HOT!!!A little naughty so be aware not for youngsters.
5,Outstanding!,"After hearing ""Little White Lie"" on the radio, I had to get the CD. I've been a Tanya fan for quite awhile. After reading the other reviews, I went ahead and purchased without hesitation. I haven't even listened to the whole CD yet, but I am totally blown away by the 3 tracks I've heard. I've been a reggae fan since ""Natty Dread"" blew me away on the streets of Brooklyn in 1974. And I've listened to nothing but reggae evah since. This IS one of the best reggae CD's evah! Tanya is LARGE and not afraid to seh so! Get this one right away, you will LOVE it!!"
1,They Left Out 9 Years...,"This self-proclaimed 20th century encyclopedia of American Folk Art came out in 1991... how could it be a comprehensive look at the century's folk art in America when 9 years didn't even happen when they wrote this? There are artists left out and what is written is often slanted with regards to ""collectability"" since the authors' have invested in a large folk art collection. The emphasis is often that the early work is really the only inspired work. Once an artist is ""discovered"" by the public the art is no longer as good so you should only have the early pieces, like the ones in the encyclopedia. This bias also occurs in the author's book on Collecting American Folk Art. But really, the big flaw in this book is that it was written 9 years before the end of the century and has left out many worthwhile artists. A very disappointing book."
2,WES CRAVEN...,WES CRAVEN REALLY MISSED WITH THIS ONE. I WATCHED IT AND IT REALLY DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF STUPID AND SHUT IT OFF IN THE MIDDLE.
3,Pre X-Files (Skinner),"Even though it has a B-movie feel to it, I had fun watching it. I recommend this movie to any one who is a fan of the X Files and/or Mitch Pileggi. Timothy Leary gives a great cameo in the film."
3,"Great flick, good music","Movie styled after MTV music videos at the height of MTV's power. The movie is inventive and well worth watching. The music works well with the movie, but not as well without it. See if you can find the disc with the songs. 80's heavy metal. It's out of print, so you may have to hunt, but the songs stand on their own feet."
1,I think my IQ dropped 20 points,"I just re-watched this today. Haven't seen it since it was released on VHS way back when. My god, what a dumb movie. Before he goes to the electric chair, Horace requests a TV in his cell. Okay. Where did he get the jumper cables, black candles, and the huge books from? And it just got worse from there."
3,THE SOLO JOURNEY OF HORACE PINKER,"It's obvious that Wes Craven had high hopes for Horace Pinker to be another Freddy Krueger, but alas and alack, it didn't happen. Perhaps it's best. Although SHOCKER is a competent little thriller with some neat ideas, Pinker just isn't the kind of villain that could sustain as many films as the incomparable Freddy did. Mitch Pileggi does a great job as the bald-headed bad guy, but his shtick of being ""electrified"" would have been limited and eventually redundant. Taken on its own merits, though Craven delivers a well-done if not memorable 'shocker' in its own right. Peter Berg does a good job as the hero, and Michael Murphy is dependable as Berg's adopted father. Although the script is at times a little confusing and improbable, the entire effect is good for a few shocks and laughs."
1,There's a one-liner that's priceless,"The movie itself blows, but the funny part is when horace is arrested and taunts Peter Berg. Berg responds with some gibberish that i can't make out, but it sounds hilarious. ""Ah shushasheshu son of a bitch!"""
4,classic,just like all wes craven movies from the past its very corny but fun. one of the movies I like watching every few years and the soundtrack is great!
3,"Good special effects, dumb script",Very creative and good special effects but this film gets shot down with a bad script and dull storyline
1,"An ""idiot"" movie","Wes Craven borrows from his own ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" by creating another wisecracking villain who lives in a ""nether"" world. He also copies the well- worn notion of the monster that can bop from body to body that has been used in so many other movies.This movie suffers from being so 1980-ish yet, even for the inane 80's, it's still sooooo stupid.The movie is not stupid in an innocent, guilty pleasure manner since aspects of the story are too mean spirited, the language is peppered with silly expletives and the pointless mysogeny is offensive.Hollywood laughed all the week to the bank with this totally, lacking of any suspense and scares, piece of garbage"
1,Wish you could rate a movie 'below' one star,"Anyone whose watched lots and lots of movies, always encounters some bad ones...it's the law of averages. But this movie, Shocker...was not just bad, it was horrible. No, horrible would be too kind. I was hoping it ended about 47 minutes before it actually closed it's final curtain. If you ever buy this movie in any format...remember...you were warned !!!!"
2,The Worst Wes Craven Flick,This movie started out okay. I actually enjoyed the first 45 minutes or so. Seemed like a pretty decent slasher flick. I even liked how the main character interacted with the killer through his dreams and had to be woke up before he got killed. Very reminiscent of Nightmare on Elm St. But after they caught the killer and executed him by the electric chair and he became an electro ghost killer (for lack of a better phrase) the movie just got flushed down the toilet. I think I dropped a whole star after the scene in the tv. It doesn't get much more horrible than that. I don't mind cheese in horror flicks. Its common. But I literally felt embarassed in front of the other people watching this with me cuz I rented it. I bet Craven doesn't put this one on his resume. 2 stars for the first 45 minutes that were okay.
2,"Somewhat amusing, but too silly.","Apparently, Peter Berg stars as a college football star whose foster family is killed by Horace Pinker, a deranged killer who worships television. When Pinker is executed, his soul continues to survive in the form of electricity and he travels from body to body. Fun core idea from the mind of Wes Craven really goes nowhere, and though it's all watchable, it's not a very satisfying experience."
2,Weak Wes Craven film,"Shocker is a mediocre effort from Craven that actually wastes good special effects and a good cast(Michael Murphy,Peter Berg,Mitch Pileggi,Cami Cooper,Ted Raimi,and even Dr.Timothy Leary). Shocker is a tale about a Freddy Krueger-like killer named Horace Pinker that kills families and then gets sentenced to death by the electric chair and that dosen't work so his spirit possesses other people. Not a very good film but still fairly watchable.The highlight of the movie would be when Peter Berg is in the park and he gets chased by a policeman possessed by Pinker and then a little girl gets possessed.The People Under the Stairs is much,much better and you could tell Craven actually tried when he made that film."
1,not the right soundtrack,"cd was not what I thought it was.CD was an instrumental cd..I want the real sountrack..with the songs from alice cooper,and dudes of wrath..ect...can anyone help me?"
3,"Not Craven's best, but worth a look","This 1989 horror flick directed by Wes Craven (Last House on the Left, Hills Have Eyes, Nightmare on Elm Street) is far from Craven's finest hour, but it is still worth a look for horror fans. The story revolves around a serial killer (Mitch Pileggi, Skinner from The X-Files) who is re-born as a spiritual, electrical force which can jump from one body to another. His target: a young athlete (Peter Berg from TV's Chicago Hope and the director of The Rundown) who shares a link with the killer. Full of uneven pacing and more than a few loose ends, Shocker still manages to be entertaining despite it's faults, and thanks to the oddball, colorful casting and Craven's directing, Shocker avoids being the piece of horror shlock it seemed destined to be. The film is backed by a rocking metal soundtrack, highlighted by Megadeth's headbanging cover of Alice Cooper's ""No More Mr. Nice Guy""."
5,Just what the floor ordered,"These Bona mop pads are gentle on your wood floors, easy to wash, and economical in the 3-pack. Little loops gives the fabric great grabbing power for animal hair."
3,ok,"Good, yet too simple. The CDs do not expand enough the vocabulary. You get tired of the same phrases and vocabulary."
3,3.5 stars,I didn't purchase this course but found it at the library and decided to try it out...It's a good start that helps you with proper pronunciataion but it's a little slow and repetitive and only a few new words are added with each new unit lesson.But aside from that....It's a fun way to learn....I did it in my car...it's very easy and quick and the method does work well...it's easy to remember! And it also gives you a lot of time to respond so you don't have to stop the disc or pause...which is very nice...you don't feel like you're rushed...
3,Good for pronunciation.,"This course uses a repetitive memorization method to help you fairly easily learn a few stock phrases, and pronounce them quite well. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the total vocabulary learned is small, and there's no way you would be able to really communicate with someone in Romania, based on this course alone.I think it is also unsuitable as an introductory basis for further study, because it is unsystematic- no concepts of verb conjugation or language structure is really demonstrated- only ""When would you like to eat something"" and ""Would you like something to drink"". Perhaps if Pimsleur also had a more advanced series of lessons available, this could be more useful. As is, I think it isn't worth the high cost. It does have a use for helping pronunciation, especially if you don't have access to a native speaker. Perhaps, for a more thorough course, consider Deletant's Colloquial Romanian."
2,"Repeditive, not worth the cost","To its credit, the Romanian tapes contained in this volume were an excellent way to practice proper Romanian pronunciataion. And, they were a valuable resource for learning the Romanian language.The tapes started simply and gradually increased in complexity as they progressed. Unfortunately, the transition between tapes was too gradual. When progressing through the tapes, as few as three or four words were added in a single 1/2 hour tape.In my opinion, Pimleur (sp?) missed the primary advantage of the tape format -- the ability to replay them until they are mastered. By missing this point, they only placed 2 hours of material on 5 hours of tape."
3,Romanian: Learn to Speak and Understand Romanian with Pimsleur,Quality of disks is good. For complete beginners the accompanying book could have had more text in it.
3,Romanian,"It is not quite what I expected, but it is still a fairly good tool to use to learn the language. I would have rather had a book to come with the CD's so that I had a visual as well."
5,I'm impressed,"I am so impressed with the Pimsleur method. I have been amazed at how comfortable I feel speaking the language. When I studied other languages in school I tended to rely on reading, but was hesitant to speak. This is a much more helpful way to learn in preparation for my trip to Romania. It frustrates me a little not knowing how to write in Romanian, but I think I will be rewarded by being able to actually talk to people. The vocabulary is useful for a traveler. I'm surprised as I go through my regular interactions with store clerks, waiters, etc. to find that I can mentally say the sentences I would need if I were in Romania. My Romanian daughter-in-law says my accent has improved a lot as I've gone along, too. It's limited, but for a basic travel vocabulary and confidence, I couldn't ask for more. Worth every penny!"
3,Could've Been Better,"This is a pretty cool soundtrack. What other soundtrack do you know of that has Pantera,Hatebreed,Shadows Fall,Morbid Angel, Fear Factory,& Lamb Of God on it? Three for the bands on it. Though they should've added Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, Mayhem, Six Feet Under,White Zombie, and some other cool bands, and take away bands like 40 Below Summer,Static X, & Soil. That's just my oppion"
3,Could've Been Better,"This is a pretty cool soundtrack. What other soundtrack do you know of that has Pantera,Hatebreed,Shadows Fall,Morbid Angel, Fear Factory,& Lamb Of God on it?

Though they should've added Slayer, Cannibal Corpse, Mayhem, Six Feet Under, Suffocation, and some other cool bands, and take away bands like 40 Below Summer,Static X, & Soil. That's just my oppion"
1,Not Music From: Music Inspired by,"There was no pop/rock music in this movie. It was just a phenomenal film score. That was one of the aspects that made this film so damn good. At the end the sheer terror and disturbance of the film was not interrupted or destroyed rather by some new stupid song by Creed or Godsmack or Slipknot. It had score music throughout and closed with the most perfect score music that could have fit this film.Why does every single movie made these days have to be associated with the degrating and declining musical ability of so many of today's pop artists? Just leave this one alone, the score was so perfect. I have nothing against any of the bands on this album or the songs, I'm just saying that as was done with The Blair Witch Project, a movie that was made so perfectly, and was pop music-less FOR A REASON has one again been plagued with it. The music may be really good, but don't associate with the movie by any means. Just get the score"
3,Wimpy,"Ok, the movie was a bomb. That is pretty pathetic that a movie released in 2003 with all the advances in special effects could not top a movie made in the 1970s on what seems to be a budget of $500. The movie should have made the point that producing anything for our conformist society will wind up trash. I think the producers of the soundtrack forgot this information.I would rate this soundtrack higher than other blockbuster horror film soundtracks because most of the bands on here are somewhat decent. But the fact that they bands are okay does not eclipse the question of whether or not the music fits with the movie. As one of my predecessing reviewers mentioned, cannibal corpse would have been an obvious choice. Also, I would have added some Carcass, Nile, Dimmu Borgir, Slayer and other underground black/death/thrash/grindcore music."
3,Ah well... light bulbs,"What's to say? These are conventional 7 Watt light bulbs for low voltage (12V) Malibu garden lights. They come in packs of four; they are rather more expensive than they ought to be; and they last months (maybe a year if you've got your voltage under strict control). It looks like Intermatic (maker of Malibu) have a patent on the socket of these bulbs. (Sigh.)These are way cheaper than the official Malibu price. Remember that these bulbs do burn out, and get multiple packs to keep the shipping cost down. Two packs are already cheaper than buying local.I looked at LED replacement lights, but they're clearly not ""there"" yet - $5-$10 per light (vs. $2.50 for 4), and LED lights are way, way dimmer than the 7W or 11W bulbs. I tried LED bulbs, and my wife said, ""You've got to be kidding."" We actually need to light up walkways. If you just need glowy mood lights, and you're willing to pay to feel good about yourself, go for the LEDs now. Otherwise, it'll be another year or three."
4,A Woman Leaves Her Home,"This easy-to-read novel chronicles the movement of Lucy Scott Mitchum across the prairies and through the wilds and over the mountains to her new home in the Sacramento Valley. Although this is not a scholarly work, it is a realistic rendering of the worries and problems facing a woman moving West in a troubling times. What I liked best about this book is that far from painting these immigrants with the usual ""hero"" paintbrush and making them bigger that life, Barbara Riefe was able to make them human beings with all the failings that that entails. Her Lucy Scott Mitchum made love, worried about friendships, worried about her child, and loved her husband, even though she did not think he was infalable. Just as in real life, there was not an entirely happy ending, but not an entirely unhappy one either. I look forward to Barbara Reife's further books"
1,A terrible book about the Gold Rush.,"""Against All Odds: The Lucy Scott Mitchum Story"" is about an extremely interesting topic - the Gold Rush and how families packed up what they could fit into a covered wagon and begin a new life in states which offered wealth and prosperity - but this story was very dull and mundane. At points, the story dragged on and on and then a split second later, it jumped ahead ten days with a brief paragraph about what happened. With barely any dialogue, diary entries, or letters, this novel only described feelings and events. The ending came too fast and was too short, compared to the rest of the book and seemed very unrealistic to me. I was very disappointed - I do not recommend."
4,"Good songs, good quality, great price.","Also buy the ""Beltin' The Blues"" CD with this one (they appear to be a set)."
5,Took a chance...and I am glad I did!,"I was shopping on amazon.com for another fragrance, and this scent was listed as a recommendation. I decided to order it because it was so inexpensive, and I figured I would give it a try. I would definitely order it again or give it as a gift. It is very light and pleasant - not at all musky, but very clean smelling - fresh and not offensive. When I would wear this, I would get a lot of compliments. I finished the bottle a while ago - I will eventually order it again."
4,Smells great and awesome price!,"This has a very fruity some what sporty smell to it and is very unique. I love the smell and recommend trying it out if your into fruity sporty smells. I only give it 4 stars because of the duration it lasts. You get about 4 hours tops out of a couple sprays, still a great deal for this price though!"
4,Smells good and good for the price.,"This product smeells fantastic is all i can say.The only thing i would change of it would be to make it just a small bit more pungent so it can last longer.Other than that, its just a wonderful scent. I would compare it to armais and some of the armani scents."
2,Fujiyama By Succes De Paris For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray doesnt last long,Smell too muck like alcohol and dont last to long probably 1 hour at the most.Would not recommend to no one
5,Smells Good,This is a surprisingly fresh smelling cologne. Got my first bottle for my birthday from a friend and bought another bottle just because. You get a lot for the price and it doesn't smell like other colognes that are being sold at this price.
3,you get what you pay for,"the product is pretty much worth the money, smells very cool, and fresh yet vanishes very fast feel as if you did not wear any in the first place. ideal for work and school. the fragrance does not bother other, it is rather refreshing."
1,Cuisinart 3-1/2-Quart Nonstick Saute Pan with Lid,The pan is fine but I did not receive the lid. Perhaps a little more care in being sure that the shipment is complete would be in order.
5,Saints Reebok Men's NFL Team Varsity Jacket,Great jacket at a great price and a helleva Team who is Super Bowl Bound. I couldn't pass it up.
4,Adorable toy for children.,"I bought this tractor for my 3 year old daughter, and she absolutely LOVES it! She also has the Safari Tractor, and she likes to play with them together. She can press the button and the horn toots while the lights on the front go on. This is a great product for kids!"
1,dangerous choking hazard,"My son loved this toy also. HOWEVER, this morning as he was playing he started coughing. I looked over to find the small hand piece missing off the farmer. When initially examining the toy upon purchase all the pieces appeared safe for a toddler as the package indicated. Obviously that is not the case as one hand piece had come off completely. I plan to contact the manufactor, however I strongly caution anyone who chooses to purchase this toy. As fun as it may seem it is obviously a choking hazard."
3,"Cute, but can you handle the noise?","As cute as this is and as much as my son loves it, you should be warned that this toy is obnoxiously loud. I would give it five stars otherwise, but the volume issue is too great."
4,Great fun!,"We gave this to our 15 month old boy for Christmas last year, and he loved it. Once he opened it, he wouldn't play with any other toys he opened. Almost a year later, its still one of his favorite toys. He loves having Old MacDonald sing, pressing the animals down to make their sounds, and, msot importantly, having the tractor move on its own. My only SLIGHT complaints about this toy is that the animals don't stay in place very well... and I do agree that its a very noisy toy. Otherwise, I'd give it five stars."
4,Farmer Girl,I got this for my daughter for her first birthday. We saw it on the Baby Einstein video and she always pointed at it. It is easy to push around. The animals are easy to hold. We live on a farm so the tractor and animals are a hit. It sings Oh Mac Donald Had A Farm. Great toy.
3,where are the animals?,"The star ratings I put down don't express how much fun my 3 year old son and my one year old daughter are having with the toy. In theory it is great. One major problem though, where are the animals? Only the farmer is included and I don't know where to buy the anumals from. So there are holes where each animal is to be placed and buttons that makes an animal sound in the hole but no animals. Also, for [the money] I would think they would be included."
5,great toy,i bought this toy for my kid. he is enjoying a lot and having full fun...great product and great price ....
5,Huge Hit,This was a huge hit with my 20 month old grandson. Completely captured his attention during the Christmas present opening frenzy.
3,My daughter hates it!,"My daughter (20 months) is terribly scared with the sounds this toy makes. They are way too loud and there's no volume adjustment. I had to remove the batteries and she's still a bit scared that it might suddenly start honking. Just pulls the animals and runs away to play with them, guess I could just buy a set of small plastic pets for her."
4,A Good Solid Toy,"My son received this tractor as a gift for his first birthday. He dislikes toys that make electronic sounds, and this was no exception, so we removed the batteries. With those gone my son now plays with it every day. He loves to push it around and move the animals and farmer in and out. We sing ""Old MacDonald"" to him and make the animal noises ourselves. The wide flat trailer works great; when he doesn't line the feet of the animals up perfectly they still stay roughly where he wants them.Sometimes it can be hard to find toys that aren't all about the lights and noises; this one is still a lot of fun for our son without them."
5,A wonderfully simple concept,"60x60 brings together 60 works in the space of one hour, each of them only 60 seconds long. This disc traverses an amazing variety of styles from well- and lesser-known contemporary composers. It never fails to keep me interested and I look forward to future projects along these lines. If the greatest impediment toward the mainstream popularity of classical music is the lenghth of many of the works in the genre, this disc does a fantastic job of dispelling the notion that great music must be long."
2,good BUT NOT great,"Seeing how scream was one of the greatest movies of my time, any movie following it's footsteps will be decent. Scream 2 was a sad and hurried attempt to cash in on scream 1. The same does not apply to scream 3. In scream 3 the overall ranking is better than scream 2, but it does not even come close to scream 1. Scream 3 has it's moments, and a decent(but corny) ending. Actually the whole movie is corny, scary, kinda funny and worth buying if you like the first one."
1,Ha Ha Ha!,"Go ahead! Say it! (in persons voice) You don't know the ending to this if you never watched it! Well I did! After viewing the preview, I figured it out! Not very hard. This is Wes Cravens worst movie yet! If you don't know the ending of this after watching the preview, then you have got to be dumb. Don't buy this movie because the mystery of it is gone and hardly any action occurs in the film! This movie doesn't even deserve to be a film!"
3,"""Scream 3"" still lots of fun","Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is in hiding following the killings in ""Scream 2"" when the production of ""Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro"" begins production and yet another killer comes out of the woodwork. Sidney finally comes out of hiding when the killer finds her and rejoins Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale (Courteney Cox) in trying to find the killer as he is taking victims in the order in which they die in the movie. Like it's predecessors, there are slashes and scares and laughs, as well as a few cameos. Fun for fans of the series but it's obvious that this has run it's course. DVD has theatrical trailers, commentary from director Craven, a music video, outtakes from all three films, deleted scenes, and an alternate ending."
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS MOVIE?,What happened to the cool opening scene where a famous celebrity gets butchered? The clever film references in the first two movies? I might be wrong but i only counted one.They sliced away the cast members one by one through the first two but couldnt bring themselves two kill off not one of the three original players. The voice box thing is pretty stupid they kicked a good gimmick right in the jewels when they did that voice copy thing.And they cheat you when they show who the bad guy is because the set up is stupid.And the biggest slap to the face is they try to make it all okay by saying in the final part of a trilogy anything goes.
4,The screams keep coming!,"Now we have Scream 3, YES!! Though it's still not as good as the original, they've added some suspense this time! It's probably because almost every scene is darker, and the climax is in a mansion. Humor doesn't play a big part this time, but that's OK, because were more interested in finding out more about Sidney's unknown life, or at least, her mother's. Overall, this installment was more fun and suspenseful, so I recommend the DVD."
5,One of the gratest films of sll time!!!!!!,this is the best folim out of the whole scream seritses. i saw this movie when it frirst came otbn and thosught thnat everyonez iz itz waz greatz! itz haz lotz of laighz and excitment. courtey coxz iz great and david arqueete is very funny. Wez craven iz one of the great directors of all time!
2,"Entertaining, but that's all.","In line with its predecessors, ""Scream 3"" employs the same devices and theme to produce an entertaining blend of new age horror and roll your eyes humor. The acting is adequate and characters are what we would expect in this trilogy. Perceptions vary as to what is scary or humorous, and this is one of those movies that most people view with tongue in cheek. That being said, there is a degree of mystery and suspense here of the whodunnit variety as with the prior two that is worth mentioning, and it is entertaining for that and its slasher qualities. Interestingly enough, this movie takes the actual trilogy theme to heart in that on the one level takes, it takes itself seriously and on the other, it pokes fun at itself, but that is what the ""Scream"" movies are all about. Ultimately, while the movie plays out as a horror movie, it is simply not scary despite its entertainment value."
5,Scream 3 is the ULTIMATE SCREAM!!!,"I must say that Scream 3 is the best movie out of Scream 1 and Scream 2! I have Scream 1 on dvd and now I have Scream 3 on vhs, I just need to buy Scream 2 now ;o)! I saw Scream 2 at a friends house awhile back and it's pretty good but not as good as Scream 3. Scream 3 is much better!!! I totally reccomend you BUY Scream 3!!! It's the ULTIMATE SCREAM!!!!"
5,Made me jump and laugh again and again,"With every other horror trilogy i've seen, the first is okay, the second, gets worse, and by the third i forget why I ever took the time to watch any of them. Scream 3 is different. It is every bit as scary as the first two, if not more and was definetly more funny. Its probably my favorite of the three, although the ending was kinda stupid, only the very ending. I have seen the collectors edition of Scream 1 with the director and writers commentary and it was very interesting. I only wish I had been more careful and bought the collectors edition of the second."
2,PLEASE MAKE THIS BE THE LAST ONE,"THIS SECOND SEQUEL DIDN'T REALLY NEED TO BE MADE. ON THE SET OF ''STAB 3'', YET ANOTHER COPYCAT KILLER EMERGES. THE ENTERTAINMENT JUST ISN'T THERE MOST OF THE TIME. THE ROMANTIC SUBPLOT BETWEEN DAVID ARQUETTE AND COURTENEY COX SEEMS TO BE GOING TO A VERY BIG LEVEL. IRONICALLY, DAVID ARQUETTE AND COURTENEY COX ARE ACTUALLY MARRIED IN REAL LIFE AS THIS WAS BEING TYPED. THIS SERIES WAS FUN AT FIRST, BUT NOW IT'S LOSING ITS EXCITEMENT. YOU MIGHT WANNA STICK WITH THE FIRST TWO MOVIES AND FORGET ABOUT THIS ONE. EVEN THOUGH NEVE CAMPBELL, DAVID ARQUETTE, AND COURTENEY COX HAVE ALL CAME BACK FOR THIS ONE, THEY CAN'T SAVE THISONE."
2,POOR-AVERAGE HORROR MOVIE,"Scream 3 stars david arquette and neve campbell once again and adds another stupid entry in the series which wasnt that great to begin with. The first Scream was so-so and ever since then it went downhill and makes the old time movies like halloween , nightmare on elm street series and friday the 13th look like masterpieces. I dont understand how you people can call this a masterpiece and say how good it is when it cant even compare to the older horror movies. Personally i think it sucked."
3,Not That Good of A Wes Craven Movie!,"There are too many Scream movies and the only problem is that they are getting worse and worse. I enjoyed Scream 1 to the maximum and I liked Scream 2. But Scream 3 is just another desperate attempt to attract movie-goers to the theaters and tape stores. I thought the effects with the scares were good and the cast did a good job. I feel that there should be no more ""Scream"" movies because of the quality of each movie. Will it ever stop, will there be a Scream 12 someday?"
5,Deadliest Scream!,"What a movie this is!I've been a HUGE fan of the series and i've been looking forward to seeing this final installment of the trilogy for ages..and boy was it worth it!The third Scream movie scores high for being darker,different in character from the other two,very original at places and yet still manages to link directly to the former two as a true trilogy chapter should.As different as this one is though, you still get some dejavou scenes reminiscent of scream 1 mostly,just like the other Craven flicks ""A Nightmare on ElmStreet\New Nightmare,really cool.The new line up of supportive actors are great too and the whole Stab3 thing works brilliantly.Could't have hoped for a better finish to the series; thumbs up."
2,OK,"Scream 3 is very fun, funny and is entertaining through out. But unfortinatly it is not at all scary. If you are in the mood for a fun film to watch with your friends you found it. If you won't an edge of your seat thriller look some place else. Scream 1 and 2 are much better."
1,Could not be worse,"Congrats Wes! If Scream was a TV sitcom this is what it would look like. There's not a original or funny scene in this movie...the blooper reel is more entertaining with Parker Posey playing nimbly off Courtney Cox's tired, overblown charicature. She seems to be the only one who tries to have fun with the material, and even she can't lift it. I've seen Scooby-Doo episodes that are more complex. And Neve honey, go back to TV with your 2 facial expressions, you're fifteen minutes are up."
3,Not a Good Sequel,This is the worst scream movie. To all the people out there who say it was good what was story line whats the meaning?
5,Very Good,"I saw this movie when it first came out, but i wasn't satisfied i had to own it for myself. There were things that i didn't see the first time that i had the great opportunity to see once it was in my possession. The ending wasn't quite what i had expected but very good nonetheless."
2,What a Shame?!!,"I am a big fan of SCREAM 1 & 2... and I was really hoping that Wes Craven might be able to succeed in this TRIOLOGY but as all triologies fall down... Scream 3 was as bad if not worse!The scenes of 3 are much weaker than of 1 & 2... the thrill, suspense and surprises are very low!If you are buying the Boxed set or building Scream library go ahead and buy it... if not don't consider it as it is very disappointing, at least in comparison to the 1 & 2 it failed!"
4,Out screams Scream 2!,"I had my doubts about seeing Scream 3. To my surprise it was very entertaining. The reason I like this sequel more than the second, was Scream 3 had more of the tone the first did. Scream 2 was to dark and there was no satire in number 2. Scream 3 is funny,scary,and will leave you wanting more. Their is one catch, make sure you see number 1 to understand the back story of Scream 3."
5,THE BEST IDEA EVER !,"Wes Craven knew what he was doin when he first came up with 'Scream' because after that movie became a box office hit everything went WAY up hill, I'm telling you, if you have not seen this movie, I guarantee this movie to be the best of the SCREAM TRILOGY, they used so much detail from the last 2 movies and the story line was great and everything about this movie was wonderful I REALLY wish I could give it more than 5 stars in this review!"
3,Not Bad At All,"This movie was not bad it did ok but the killer's identity was easy to find out.I have some questions whoever can anwser them please anwser them on ....thanks1.the scene where Parker Poesy said that she was the killer in Stab 3 was that a clue that Gail might be the killer in Scream 4 if they make one and if they do remake all the screams and call them Stab will Gail be the killer in Stab 3 Return to Woodsborror2.Will there be a Scream 43.Will they ever have a female as the killer without a male killer as the partner in the scream movies4.can someone tell me if there are slasher movies that have a females as the killer besides Friday The 13th, Scream 2, Urban legend, Valentine, And Sleepaway Camp 1-3Please anwser these questions if you have the anwsers onBy the way let me just say to the people who think that the upcoming horror movie CURSED is SCREAM 4 your wrong its not even a slasher movie its about a werewolf in L.A."
3,"Not Totally Great..... Better Than Scream 2, Though","The beginning of Scream 1 was good. Scream 2 was boring and this one was just okay. I actually thought I would enjoy it more than Scream 2, and I did. The story gets confusing to me, but only the best scenes are with the killer. Scream 2 had one good scene. That's it. I quite enjoy it's soundtrack but you can leave it's movie to someone else who likes it more than I do. In this one, NO ONE knows who the killer is. I knew even before I saw this movie so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it all that much. Horror movies aren't my thing very much anymore than they use to be. Oh well. Believe it or not, this was the best one, but I'm afraid it's just not as good as everyone says it is.Scream 1: The best part was the beginning.Scream 2: Not enjoyable like I was told it was.Scream 3: Okay, and the best...and ONLY OKAY."
1,"yawn, Sigh, But Whatever you do... don't scream","Admittedly, I've seen worse sequels... but the originals were [bad] along with them. Why would you ever do Scream 3 to such excellent movies like Scream and Scream 2? This movie is flat out horrible! Acting, gore, plotline, and ending. It seems like the writer had no clue where it was going to end so he just threw in little bits and pieces of everything. Its all just one big slap in the face to the end. I do NOT recommend this.P.S. Scream 3 is not the final installment in the series. Prepare for Scream 4 sometime in 2006. Neve Campbell will be back along with david Arquette, Courtney Cox, and Patrick Dempsey. Wes Craven will be back also. The filming was just declared in April 2003. Pray this will be the one to bring back the series's name."
1,Boring final entry in the SCREAM series,"Neve Campbell and goofy David Arquette return for this lousy sequel that makes old school horror fans want to bang their heads on the wall. This time, the rules have changed (of course) as anyone can be killed in ""a trilogy"" even Neve Campbell's ""Sydney"". Sorry to inform anyone with a brain but despite the fact that it advertises that ""anything can happen in a trilogy"", it is still a predictable film that follows the same rules as all these other horror movies. Where the last sequel threw in a few surprises, this one is purely predictable and does nothing worthy of note."
1,I Could have directed the movie better!,"this movie should not have been written. This movie is the absolute worst of the scream series. ""Terror on the movie set""is sort of the theme for the movie. Being that this movie was the final installment you would think that it would be good but NO. The ending is the worst. The only good thing about this movie is the cameos. (especially the one by Jay & Silent bob)"
3,OK Movie...But Cool Anyway,"The plot was good in Scream 3, and the movie is less corny then Scream and Scream 2, but the movie was still just OK. It wasn't scary enough for a horror movie. It has plenty of gore and killings, but that didn't make the movie scary. After the first time you watch Scream 3 the movie gets boring and even less scary once you know who the killer is. Most of the characters are stupid. The movie has some comedy, such as one line form Sidney (""You want me m***********!) and two lines from Tyson (""Oh s***!"", and ""Holy m**********!""), which are funny at the time they are said. The ending to the movie ................. is sad , but I'm not going to say why because that would spoil the movie. The gore is cool. I'd say you might not like this movie that much if you are over the age of 25."
5,WOW!,"When I first was going to see it, I thought, not another .... sequel, you know? I was blown away! It wasn't better than the original, but it was defenetly better than the second. It has the three survivors of the first two, ""Dewey Riley"", that clumsy Deputy whose sister died in the first Scream. ""Gale Weathers,"" that pesky reporter in the first two, and a jourilist for Total Entertainment in the third, and ""Sidney Presscott,"" living in total isolation after she was stalked. Changed her name and still, after all that, the killer has found her. I truly loved this movie. And if you liked the first two, you'll love the third. But if you've never seen the first two, you'll be lost."
5,Here We Go Again!,"Scream 3... I'm speechless. So far it was way better than the other two. I enjoy that there isn't half as much blood as the other two. The twists and turns down this road are very unsepecting. And if you are a scream fan, you'll love this movie. But I advise you watch the first two before Scream 3 or you'll won't know anything that's going on!"
2,Not as Scary as Scream & Scream 2,"I thought Scream & Scream 2 were good! The 3rd installment, on the other hand, was a huge disappointment to me. I feel like it's getting a bit more comical now. Kind of like how ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" ended up after part 2. Scream 3 wasn't as scary as the first one. The story line isn't as good either. The story takes place in Tinsel Town, where the filming of Stab 3 is taking place (what happened to Stab 2?). Sidney is in hiding somewhere in the woods (like we didn't know that was going to happen). To make a long story short, Sidney finds her long lost brother that she didn't know she had...da.dah.da..dah..da. I was also disappointed with Cottonweiry's role in the movie. The ending was open ended, so look forward to a sequel to the trilogy!"
4,"Stop ""Screaming"" Already!","I am a big fan of the Scream series but this final installment was way over the top even for my standards. It came together nicely but it felt forced. I wasn't sure if I liked all the humor that was injected this time around. Several plots and lots of characters added to the confusion. I loved Parker Posey in the Gale role and enjoyed many moments in the movie, including the interior sound stage sets of Woodsboro were Sydney is chased by the killer! A great surprise ending left me satisfied and surprised. This movie did very well without Kevin Williamson's script so enough of that issue! ........and what's up with Courteney Cox's hair and jewelry! Yikes! Gale really looked horrible in this last installment (We think? ). One suggestion for you honey: McDonald's, McDonald's, and more McDonald's!I hope the studio will sell the SCREAM trilogy in a box set, The perfect gift for a video collector!"
3,"""Not Bad Sequel!""","Neve Campbell, David Arquette and Courteney Cox star in Wes Craven's2000 horror sequel. A young woman is brought of hiding by a crazedkiller trying to make a real concluding trilogy chapter. This isn't bad,but not as good as the first 2 films. This blu-ray has nice pictureand sound plus some neat extras. I still recommend this."
4,Sequal,Scream 3 is a sequal to Sceam 2!It still has all your fave stars in itand it is still about a masked killer that stalksa group of friends.I know it sounds the exactsame as the first two but it is filled with many surprises.
5,Oh my god!,I first rented the movie when I was 10 yrs old.Nowim 14 and I have seen it 5 times!I think anyone who loves horror movies and anyone whois a Courtney Cox fan should see this movie!
5,Great end to the series.Or is it???????????,"Despite what everyone else says this movie is great. The dvd has a great amount of extras too. This is a great end to the scream movies, or is it????"
5,wow ! what a movie,"i loved this movie i saw it twice at the cinemas.a great starting to the movie,how cotton weary and his girlfriend die.such a great plot i must say,how the killer ends up as sidneys brother i loved it and recommend it to every one.note:wes craven is a exellent director."
2,STOP WHILE YOU CAN,"A suggestion to the producers of this trilogy: I suggest this was the last movie made. Otherwise, the series and characters will run the risk of becoming ridiculous (as happened with ""Friday 13th). The plot here is obviously worst than the two first movies."
2,wamp,"The story is fanntastic,thrilling ,and enjoable with the wimp to new the elasticity of the perpatual phenomena. The horror does not make boring,it is really the need of hour that such kind of flims make the people excited! Good luck and enjoy the film."
5,still a scream,"I AM A BIG FAN OF ALL THE SCREAM MOVIES,SCREAM WAS A SCREAM,SCREAM 2 WAS A BLAST AND SCREAM 3 WAS THE BEST YET,NEVE CAMPBELL,COURTNEY COX AND DAVID ARQUETE ARE DOING WHAT THEY DO BEST AND JENNY McCARTHY MADE THIS MOVIE A SCREAM! BUT WE ALL LOVE MOVIES THAT WILL MAKE YOU JUMP OUT OF YOUR SEAT,I FOUND SCREAM AND SCREAM 2 DONE JUST THAT BUT SCREAM 3 COULD HAVE DONE WITH A FEW MORE (URBAL LEGEND)FRIGHTS,I ALSO FOUND THE KILLING SCENES OVER TO QUICKLY.ITS A SHAME KEVIN WILLIAMSON DID NOT WRITE SCREAM 3. SCREAM 3 IS THE BEST OF THE TRILOGY YET WITH A GREAT CAST AND GREAT STORYLINE TO END THE FINAL CHAPTER.I HOPE WES CRAVEN DOES NOT SELL THE RIGHTS AS HE DID WITH THE FREDDY SERIES.IF YOU ARE A SCREAM FAN, SCREAM 3 IS A MUST AND HAS ONE OF THE BEST ENDINGS TO DATE."
1,This movie is wack!,I remember seeing this movie in the theaters the day it came out and remembering how disappointed i was...Scream 1 and 2 were so good...but 3 was just a waste of time and $...pass on this one people...you're not missing anything....except bordom of course.
3,Pretty good slasher,"No spoilers here. Read other reviews for that. Just some thoughts...I give this movie 3 1/2 stars.I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. It's a pretty good slasher movie. It stars David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette, Neve Campbell, Patrick Dempsey, Jenny McCarthy, Deon Richmond, and Parker Posey.It's a slasher movie that pays homage to other horror films of the past. It also spoofs them. It's definitely a different kind of horror movie. I would categorize this as a movie that appeals mostly to a teenage audience. I say this not only because of what's on the screen, but also the soundtrack, which features songs from then-current bands (some of which are still active), such as Creed, Slipknot, System Of A Down, Sevendust, Godsmack, Incubus, Coal Chamber, etc.I heard that Scream and Scream 2 are better than this one. I have yet to see those movies. I plan on seeing them in the not too distant future."
3,Good not great third entry in series,"I liked Scream 3, but found it somewhat overlong and uninvolving. The revelations at the end, left me cold. Neve Campbell is back, but emotionally scarred by the events of the first two films. She has gone into seclusion. The movie events in this film were pretty weak, as was the unending saga of Courtney and Dooley (he is not likeable to me). There are good chase scenes however, and some laughs. Weiner Dog from Welcome to the dollhouse makes a brief appearance."
4,3rd Time's The Charm: Scream 3 Succeeds,"Director Wes Craven succeeds in ending the Scream trilogy with a strong plot that is both comical and thrilling.The movie is thought-prevoking (can you believe that's possible in a horror flick?), and very funny, thanks to a great comical performance by Parker Posey. Neve Cambell returns as the long terrorized Sydney who returns to civilization when she learns the killer is back.The movie-within-a- movie ""Stab"" also plays out in Scream 3, killing off cast member by cast member.The movie is directed at the teen audience, but would entertain an adult just as well.The film is in no way like ""I Still Know What You Did Last Summer"", which was plain horrible. It is entertaining and will keep you wondering, ""Who done it?"".You truly won't know who the killer is until he unveils himself.I recommend the movie: If you enjoyed either of the first two, you'll love this one. It is by far the best, and has the strongest, most creative plot. MMS05"
3,okay...,"I`ve already seen this film and i suspected better, but it was still good. Don`t read this if you don`t want to know the killer. this probably isn`t the greatest imformation but that nerdy guy in glasses is the killer and i don`t think that sidney dies, but i know that, he is the killer for a fact."
2,Boo Hoo,"High gloss, beautiful people, action, witty back talk. I thought horror movies were supposed to horrify. Same old jump out of nowhere and orchestra hits and Dolby Surround stabbing sounds with fresh faces tossing their hair around and looking cool."
1,"Two Thumbs Down, Way Down","LEt me say this first, all critics and viewers who said this movie was actually good must be in need of nueral surgery right now. Just like the Scream 2 this movie was retarded. No Exception to Scream 2 the killer just popped out of no where, no one had a clue. Why would the director of this movie be so stupid as to have the killer a character that was never introduced throughout the whole movie. As for the people who liked the movie, I would personally like to hit you over the head with a 75 pound brick, maybe with the success of knocking at least some sence into your illigitamite teeny-bobber, crappy movie liking thick skulls."
2,I'll Scream if there's a 4th,The only thing to scream about in this tired installment is Courtney Cox's bad wig! The film is tired. Once again someone wants Sydney and will kill everyone she knows. The reason the fisrt Scream film was so great was that it poked fun at Bad films . Now Scream has become a parody of itself. No more please......
4,The best in the series! 3.5 Stars!,"Scream 3 is easily the scariest, most suspensful, and most clever of all the Scream flicks. The first one [was bad], the 2nd one was better, but this is easily the best in the series. It just barely makes a 3.5. This third installment of the hugely popular Scream trilogy doesn't have the moxie and smarts of its two predecessors, but it's still a great thrill ride. The Scream Trilogy has to be one of the most influential trilogies since Star Wars and the Godfather. The first Scream, it was easy to figure out the killers, in Scream 2 they made it harder, but I didn't guess right in Scream 3 though. So anyway, these aren't really that scary, but Scream 3 does have effectively scary parts. As I said, the slashers that came before it are FAR superior to these, but for some laughs and a couple of cheap thrills, you should buy this along with Scream & Scream 2. Watch them alone in the dark."
5,What's Your Favorite Scary Movie?,"Mine Is Definetly This One, Scream 3 Comes Out With A Bang, Not Only Does It Have A Good Plot, It Has Great DVD Features Including The Making Of All 3 Movie's, Deleted Scenes, Outtakes, And A Commentary With The director Wes Craven, Original Theatrical Trailer, trailer Spots, And A Creed Music Video. REVIEW'S - ""Action, Thrills And Laugh's Galore!"" (wbai Radio, New York) - ""A Slam-Bang Finish To This Exceptionally Clever Trilogy!"" (Miami Heald) - ""Suspenseful, Clever & Very Entertaining!"" (NBC-TV) - ""The Ultimate 'Scream'!"" (The New York Times) The Most Terrifying Scream Is Always The Last!"
4,"Origianl Scream Still the best, but Scream 3 is still good.","Well, in my opinion, the first Scream is still the best, but the 3rd is still a good movie. The overall plot is good, and continues to move the storyline set in the first two, and closes it out really well. My only real complaint and the reason I didn't give it a 5 was lack of real development in the supporting cast. In the first movie you really got to know all the cast, from Sidney down to Principal Himbry. In number 2 it was the same, other then a few such as Cici, you really got know most of the characters. In the 3rd you continue get more on the happenings of Sidney, Gale, and Dewey. But only the Lead detectice, and the actor who played Gale, really got much attention. The other people were just there, and I really didn't care one way or the other when they got killed. Well, other then that one complain it's a good movie. I reccommened it to anyone who enjoyed the first and/or second Scream films."
2,This 'Scream' Does Not Deliver!,"The third installment in the extremely popular Scream Trilogy is missing the cleverness, style and wit of its two predecessors. The screenwriter seems to be out of ideas and without any clever tricks to pull out of his sleeve. Wes Craven is a very clever horror director and has directed many classics in the genre, but he simply doesn't have the right material here. The cast also seems tired and they all repeat what they've down in the previous movies. Some attempts a comedy fall flat, and an assortment of unlikable supporting characters doesn't help. The 'keep guessing until the last scene' technique really doesn't work here. Too bad, because the first two 'Scream' movies we're good and it would have been a memorable trilogy. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 3!"
2,DIE ALL READY!,"After Kevin Williamson dropped out of this project, I thought that there might be a glimmer of hope. Alas...no. The dialogue is laughably bad and the plot is ludicrous. The only bright spot is a surprise cameo by Jay and Silent Bob. By the end of the trilogy, Sydney has become so annoying that you are almost rooting for her to get killed. Fortunately, Courtney Cox gets more screen time in this one."
2,Scream 3,"The first Scream was very good, the second was not bad, but this third one is really stupid. Sequels really suck, and no rules are broken here. Here Neve Campbell is NOT the main character, but Arquette and Cox Arquette. It's another round of brutal and bloody terror with slashing and killing. It's somewhat predictable and a little boring. I really hope there's not going to be a fourth Scream; one was enough. All in all, if you like horror, I guess you would like this one, but there's no solid plot behind."
1,RUINNED THE SERIES,"I am a big fan of the horror genere. I am especially fond of Wes Craven. But Scream 3 is just bad film making. It is completely unoriginal, completely stupid (no voice changer can steal someone's voice so you can talk just like they do.), and all in all, a complete representation when a studio wants to milk a good idea for money. The ""revalations"" in this movie are so queer and unnessacary, when are people going to realize you dont have to explain every little thing in a movie, you dont have to somehow tie everything together. So, if your a fan of in your face, no holds barred, ground breaking horror, stay away. If you like predictable hollywood soft ""horror""...be my guest."
4,DVD delivers - but not all it promises,"Scream 3 is the perfect bookend to a flawed series, but I'm not here to review the movie, just the DVD.There are quite a few special features . . the outtakes are especially hilarious, but I was most disappointed that my copy did not have the CREED music video nor the cast & crew bios. The back of the DVD case claims to have these special features, and I'm sure I could live without them, but it's the principle."
4,Over the top!,"I first viewed Scream when I was reluctant of it's success. I was convinced that it would flop. Boy was I wrong. Scream 1 set the stage for this hip and frightening trilogy. Introducing us to the key players of the story. Scream 2 put all the protagonists into a huge hole from where they would have to get themselves out. Scream 3 bypasses both films and takes the movie out with a bang. Sidney's backstory of her mother is finally revealed with so many secrets being uncovered. The best part was the list of suspects that could be the mysterious ghostface killer. Wes Craven, when will this trilogy be out on DVD as a gift set. I'm dying for it."
3,This movie was downhill from Scream & Scream 2,"I am sorry to say that I was really disappointed that this movie did not deliver. The plot could've worked well if the actors could've worked with it. Their performances were just so campy! This movie could have been much better but it just seemed like the actors were not interested in their parts. Except for maybe Parker Posey. Courtney Cox & David Arquette seemed bored. As for Neve Campbell - it doesn't look like she wanted to do this movie. I don't blame her one bit given her castmates' performances.I really enjoyed Scream & thought that Scream 2 was pretty good as well. I was actually looking forward to seeing Scream 3. But to no avail.The only reason this DVD gets three stars is because of all of the extras on it. Bloopers, Deleted Scenes, Lots of extras - I actually haven't had a chance to go through all of them yet. Movie rates a 2. DVD rates a 4.Save your money - rent it - don't buy it."
2,"unrealistic, and unneeded.","scream 2 was eh, this one? NO. sidney had a brother. shocker! how would we know that and how could we guess that? a complete cheat of a suprise ending. and the whole blowing up of the house and the fax machine scene? impossible!! this movie is just very unrealitic, not funny, not clever just plain stupid. very dissapointed."
3,Three stars for the third scream.,"I really enjoyed the first two scream movies, but this one just seemed a little off. I think it was the whole step brother thing that threw me off. Once again, it was nice to see the original characters return, with some new faces thrown in also, but it just wasn't there for me."
2,Awful Game,"This game did not meet my expectactions. After buying and enjoying NBA Street Vol. 2, I thought this game would be better. This game is so unbelievably unrealistic and unfun. Let me give you a word of advice, If you're debating on whether or not to buy this game or Madden 2004 get Madden. It is so much more fun and realistic. I can understand how you might say that the game is supposed to be realistic, the makers went over the top. If you have played at a friends house and have enjoyed it, it gets boring after four times."
2,Great Idea....but falls short,"It is a very good concept & the game could be amazing. I wish they had created a dynasty, franchise or at least a tournament mode. You have to start out with ""no name"" players & play against pro-players to unlock new levels stadiums etc..It would be fun to manage the team & trade players to work towards a championship or superbowl. Instead the game goes no where. It's more like NFL Blitz than a Madden type game. It gets old quick. Good idea & good intention...hopefully a better sequel is in the works!"
1,Not Tough Enough,Well i played this game and was disapointed first of all the music stinks the controls stinks the game play stinks .You can't make hard hitting tackles. You get bored after a while no replay. If you want a fun football Arcade Style series get the NFL Blitz. The Blitz series is better. If you want a good football simulation series get the Madden .If you want a good Street series get the NBA Street series
5,So totally awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I just got the game and it is awesome. It has hard hitting tackles. The whole game is awesome. The only thing that sucks about it is that the challenge is so freakin hard
3,its half n half,this game is cool but street ball 2 is alot better. and i would say its the 3rd coolest football game.by the way it may look like a fun game on tv but its not that fun.
4,GREAT GAME,"I would have given the game 5 stars except for the fact that if you are good at football games and know the controls and play the game for a few hours straight you can almost beat it. What I especially liked was the challenges are challenging(name suits it)and once you get enough tokens from winning the ladder games, you can play against a certain team for one of their players. Again, this game is great and you wont be dissapointed. (im actually 13 but was too lazy to fill out all that stuff)"
3,Alright i guess,This game is ok but not nearly as good as NBA street so buy that becasue this game gets old fast and there isnt much to it just a few plays and no defense at all
1,NFL Street Stinks!!!!!!,This is the worst football game i have ever played. I Have 7 other football game. I hate this one. The grafics are bad and i hate it. dont buy it you will hate it too!!!. i gaurante it.
4,"NOT MADDEN, BUT STILL WORTH THE PRICE","I love madden. I've bought the last 6 years worth of maddens, and will always treasure that series. But after 10 straight seasons every year, I could use a football game that i don't have to always think so hard about. That is what is so great about nfl street. its a great game to play when you don't want to get to deep into it. The only let down was not being able to play challenge games with pro players, but the create a player is quite awesome. Football needed this game, and blitz was crap, so its refreshing to have a good game to have a few beers and pound away at the teams you hate. GO BENGALS!!!!!!!"
5,The best street game ever made,When Ifirst played this game it was kind of hard.But then I learned how to do stylin moves and then I rocked.In NFL Challenge you can create a team name and name the players.You can also choose a player's 4 stylin moves.Make your players have good attributes by beating challengs.Theres a lot of more secrets but you will have to play the game to find out.
1,Not so good,I ordered this phone in hopes it would do what i needed. BLECH! the reception was lousy and didn't have the features i needed. I couldn't see the screen at all - it was always at the wrong angle. I'm returning this item. Still looking for a good replacement for my Siemens gigaset 2120... will keep looking.
1,VERY MISLEADING,"Jan 2 2006I two ordered the ""md7001 2 line phone"" I thought I was getting a cordless 2 line phone. What I actually got was a 2 line handset that requires a base unit for it to work. This info should be prominently displayed in their description."
1,Poor Reception - Very Static,We purchased this phone to go with the rest of the set and we were extremely disappointed!! We had to return them for a different brand because we could not hear!!! They were so static that you often could not hear the person speaking!! You would think at this price it would not be so static. We went for a brand at a much lower price and they are crystal clear!!
2,Not really for business use,"The quality of the phone is very good. BUT, there is no privacy feature. If I am making a call on line 1, anyone can pick up that same line and listen in or join in. It has happened many times, someone will be using line 1 for example, I will dial a number and press the line 1 button only to find out that it is already in use and interrupting and annoying the other person. I am checking to see if I can return for a refund......"
2,Not the information claimed,"The book was supposed to have birth dates, parents etc. Immigration report. Had none of that and no proof when my ancester immigrated. Waste of my money."
3,Just another sport story,"If you like sports stories, then Me Mop and the Moondance Kid is the book for you. We did not think that the book was interesting because it repeated itself over and over. It was not what we expected it to be. We would not recommend this book to our classmates. This book was mainly about a group of kids playing baseball and trying to win a tournament. Will they win or lose? You will have to read it to find out. We give the book three stars.Book review by: Alex H. and Jaime M."
1,Superman21's Review,"Me, Mop, and the Moondance Kid is a 1 out of 5 stars. My first reason is that there is already a story of 3 orphans, and the customer from Amazon.com couldn't even understand. He might have read it, but he DID NOT understand it. I mean, he called the umpire a referee and he says he's very athletic, but he's not. If he was he would have said umpire, not referee."
1,Complete waste of money!,"I have/had a Casablanca fan with the Inteli-Touch controls, the fan worked perfectly for a few years then all of a sudden I could not turn the lights off with the wall control.I emailed casablanca.... no help, I went to google and eventually determined that a control board in the fan went bad (a board you need in the fan for the Inteli-touch) so $100 later and my fan was up and running again. Well not even a year later it has happened again! I emailed casablanca yet again and they still were not willing to help me, I asked why my $600 fan already needed $200 in repairs and they stopped responding to my emails! They have the absolute worst customer service I have ever encountered, I took the fan down and replaced it with a $110 Harbor Breeze fan and a $35 Lutron Maestro remote. I used to think Casablanca made good fans, but after this experience I will never install another one of their products."
2,Did not fit as expected,"This was much tighter than expected and was not comfortable to wear. I though about trying a larger size, but instead went with a full sleeve model that is working great."
2,Wears out quickly,"After a week of heavy use, this product became stretched out and now slips down my leg when just walking around - let alone exercising. It's now only usable when I'm sleeping or sitting around for long periods (both exactly the times it isn't needed.)It worked fantastically for about 10 hours of heavy exercise and 40 hours of walking-only use, but is now worthless."
3,Great Product but Poor Quality,"Provides optimal knee stability. I use it 3-4x per day at Cross Fit, which requires flexibility, range of motion, weight, and impact on the knees. You can really tell the difference using/not using this support. The instructions indicate rinsing with warm water to remove salts accumulated from perspiration. It dries quickly. I had to give it 3 stars because the stitching the held the support below the kneecap ripped. I had to purchase a replacement. At 5'6"" the small fit perfectly."
1,to big,"The Pro-Tec Athletics short sleeve knee support was to large and didn't fit well. I needed a large knee support, but didn't know if I was able to return the item."
4,Pro-Tec Short Sleeve Knee Support,"Fits pretty well and stays in place except when doing extreme work outs (such as grappling). Provides support and has helped reduce my knee pain. Light weight.Pretty slimy from sweat when removed even after light exercise, but doesn't develop a smell easily. Stretched a little in the first week of use, but not since then. Starting to show wear around the knee cap hole after two months of use, for 20 hours a week. No noticeable decline in performance however."
5,Well made and perfectly sized neoprene knee support,"My old neoprene knee brace has had enough use and washings so it isn't quite the support I used to have. This short sleeve knee support is well-constructed and the rubber bumper under the patella seems to stabilize the patella permitting lots of movement with minimum stress on the knee. It does have some lining but it's not thick. There are no metal/plastic braces to worry about and I'm not sure they do that much good anyway. While I'm not saying I can do things now that I couldn't do, I feel more secure and can still play 2 hrs of doubles tennis so I'm pleased. This is a much better value than most of the other knee sleeve supports I have investigated. Fast & free shipping via Amazon since I combined products with free shipping. I'll certainly buy another one when the time comes."
4,Great rod,"Love this rod. Very versatile-fluke bluefish, stripers, largemouth and smallmouth bass, catfish and carp have all been caught on it. Very Sensitive."
1,Not what I wanted,I ordered this product thinking it was for LONG PANTS as my school doesn't allow shorts. I got the product and it turned out to be shorts. Thought maybe I made a mistake. So I reordered and didn't realize until the product was IN MY CART that it said shorts. Everywhere else it said pants and the picture was of long pants.
1,what?,"I bought this record for the soft acoustic-pop song ""swing life away"" expecting the rest of the album to sound similar. WTF! Its all screaming! How misleading is that. Download swing life away instead. (Actually, nothing i've said here is true. I really like this record and most of the songs on it. the double and triple layer vocals are awesome! but i couldn't resist, considering it was such an obvious thing to complain about)"
1,title of review,"This is the most insipid garbage I've ever heard passed off as ""punk"". These guys are stemming the tide of mainstream pop-punk? Dude, no. They're worse because they're actually trying to pretend they're better than or different to those bands. At no point does the guitar sound at all jagged, gritty, or dirty. It's all languid, lackluster, limp-wristed powerchord strumming that has more in common with Nickelback and Three Days Grace than it does with even Blink 182 or Sum 41, let alone any real punk bands. The vocals are the only thing that set this album apart from any of those bands. This isn't the sound of a band attacking their instruments like they mean it. This is the sound of a band sitting back in comfortable chairs watching tv while they churn out boring, energyless music with as much disinterest as possible. The producer has also done his best to drain the sound of any vitality it may have had and make it as homogenized as possible."
5,Thank you Rise Against,"This cd brings me back to the punk of the mid 90's...its great. It took Rise Against to a different level, their sound has changed slightly, but like mentioned earlier....you cant really skip a track on this.I like the ""give it all"" version from RAB vol.1 better than the album version...they changed it around a little bit. If you find after the first listen your not totally feeling the cd just yet...read the lyrics, they'll wake you up.My favorites on the cd are ""Life Less Frightening"", ""Dancing for Rain"", and ""rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated"". I believe these are the songs that the band has shown the most progression with.Rise Against, your jump to DreamWorks hasn't disappointed me."
4,Hit Machines,"Rise Against is such a versatile band. This CD alone has 3 hit songs on it, each being completely different from the next."
4,Very good album,"This is a really good CD to get if you are into the whole pop-emo thing. I wouldn't label this as punk (like Sex Pistols or Misfits) because it's more melodic. It's more along the lines of New Found Glory or maybe Pennywise or Bad Religion. It's probably realitively easy to find an mp3 for ""Life Less Frightening"", which is in my opinion the best song off the CD. If you like the aforementioned bands, then definitely get this, as you won't be disappointed."
5,Rock as it should be!!!!!!!!!!!,"What a great disc, this is refreshing for the current state of same old same old music. After listening to this a few times I have no plans on taking it out of my CD player. It really reminds me of the Goo Goo dolls when they 1st started way back in the late 80's. Straight forward rock with teeth in the true spirit of punk."
2,"As pissed as you will be while you're reading this, i was dissapointed...","I, just personally, think that this album was really dissapointing. At some palces it was horribly repetitive. I mean, the lyrics are great, and some tracks really stand out and are kick ass songs, but... this CD was very, very repetitive... Sorry, fellow punks, but i just can't write a good review for this..."
2,Not what it seems...,"This CD gets two stars for the first single ""State of the union"", and zero for the rest. Every song after track one is punk-pop, simple plan style garbage. If you want some good Hardcore music, download that track on i-tunes and look into bands like thrice and seventhstar. For what its worth, some of the tracks are OK, but that doesn't change the fact that they are basically lesser known mtv punk..."
2,idk,"i tried so hard to like this album, but not only are their political views annoying, their music isn't anything new or special. They are just beating the dead horse here. I will compliment the singer on his voice and the guitar work isn't bad.. but its just nothing that catches my attention. Their previous albums are better anyway."
5,WOW,"I only recently got into rise against. but from what ive heard comparing their new album to there older songs is that this album although not softer, but it is more melodic. it has awsome rowsing choruses that makes me want to dance. To me this album sounds like a mix between pennywise,anti flag and bigwig's invitation to tragety album. and i have to say Tim's voice is the best of the 4 bands. im amazed i didnt get into these guys earlier. amazing"
4,This CD is so Amazing! Rise Against rule,"This CD is great all songs are good. Songs like give it all and the drop out have cool up beat sound to it then you have songs like state of the union with screaming. All different styles of music in this one and of course, Rise Against can pull it off. Good job guys and this CD is definitly worth checking out.P.S Sufferer and Witness hits stores july 4th (New Rise Against CD) Get both of them if you don't have this one!I'm standing on the rooftop, READY TO FALL!"
5,Best cd I have right now,This cd is awesome. Rise Against is amazing and continue to amaze me with their latest effort. Keep it up guys!!!!
4,I actually would rate this 4 and a half,"Wow, this is definetly punk rock, but its different then Bad Religion, Strike Anywhere and others, usually I listen to kinda different stuff (Taking Back Sunday, Senses Fail) but Rise Against really hits me. Its heavy, thats for sure, the lyrics are absolutely amazing, the music is really almost as alluring as the lyrics. The songs have great variety in the sounds, from the fast intense State Of The Union, to the accoustic Swing Life Away, every song is amazing. The tracks that really catch my ears on this are, The First Drop, Rumors Of My Demise Have Been Greatly Exagerated, Paper Wings and Life Less Frightening.This CD is amazing."
5,best band of all time,"this band rocks and so does this CD. While not their best CD, I still enjoy every song. If you like this CD definately buy Revolutions Per Minute because it is by far their best album.NOTE: Swing Life Away is nothing like the rest of this bands music on all 3 of their albums... so if that is the only song you like, don't buy this CD or any of their other albums, shut up about it being the only good song and find a different band to listen too."
5,1 of the Top 5 Punk CDS ever,"This CD is unreal, as well the rest of their cds. These guys are the future of punk, they're by far the best band in years. I also really recommend Thrice, Cauterize and Choke."
1,Burned Up After 1 Year,I guess surronding an item that heats up in plastic and sticking it in water is not a great idea. Should have known.
5,Must have for newborns!,"It is easy to put on since you don't have to go over the head. Also, it doesn't aggravate the umbilical cord stump. Very soft and cozy. 5 stars!"
5,Great for PJ's!,"These onesies make the best pj's! They are so easy to change diapers in at night, and great for dressing a squirming baby after an evening bath. All babies dislike things going over their heads, so these are perfect! Wish all baby clothes were made with these concepts in mind! They are soft enough for sleeping in and wash easily. We line dried them so they wouldn't shrink, but accidentally put a few in the drier and they did just fine too. Only complaint is the tag, but it is very soft and can be easily removed if you want so it really hasn't been a big problem. Do order a size up, as they are very short in the torso compared to other baby clothes. We also tend to like them a little roomier so there is no binding when our little one sleeps. She is 2 months and fits in the 3-6 months with room to grow (and did so at 6 weeks actually). We wish they made them in the larger sizes, as I know she would love them up to a year!"
2,Tight fit for preemies,"The preemie size of these suits looked like they'd be great for our 4 lb son who arrived a little early. We first put one on him when leaving the hospital and even the nurses commented on how much they liked it. But over the next week or so we realized how tight these were. First we noticed that he ate less (had to be formula fed) when wearing these compared to a regular snap shirt. Then we noticed that they were putting pressure on the top of his diaper and pushing it into his umbilical cord stump - even causing small amounts of bleeding. Not good at all. If you're considering these for a preemie, you'd be better off with just a basic snap shirt (e.g. Gerber), diaper, and then swaddle in a light blanket."
2,Scratchy and disappointing...save your money,"I bought these based on the product description that the cotton is extremely soft and because of the unique design that does not go over baby's head. However, the cotton is not very soft. In fact, it's scratchy, even after I washed it and used extra fabric softener. The cheap onesies someone gave me from Wal mart are softer than these. The spa silk onesies are way overpriced for what you get. The softest onesies we own by far are the organic gerber. Unfortunately, they only go up to size 3-6 months. The spa silk onesies do have a great design that you don't need to pull over the baby's head, but be warned that they are made short for their size. My baby is not large for his age but these are too short on him. Save your money!"
1,Horrible Product,These look like they were designed by a blind man with no sense of proportion for babies. This is definitely you get less than what you paid for. Skip this product.
2,Size and style issues,"It's hard to tell from the white on white picture here, but the bottom flap snaps in a weird way-- the snaps are very high up. They also seem to run very small (or they shrink in the wash). My baby is 3 months old and at his most recent check-up was only in the 25th percentile for height; I bought the 9-month size thinking I would get a few larger items to be prepared ahead of time and they are too short! He is chubby (about 14 pounds) and generally wear 3-6 month items, but this is a little ridiculous."
3,"Cute, but runs small","I ordered these in a size 9 month for my then 7 month old. He was wearing size 6 month in other brands, so I ordered these so he would have room to grow. Sadly, they were fitting him exactly at the time. When I washed them, they shrank and they are now in the give-away pile. Too bad because I liked the unusual design."
4,"Great design, run small","We have had our baby in the Spasilk short-sleeve bodysuits since she came home. The front snaps are great -- and it is not easy to find a front-snap onesie. A must for first-time parents! The quality and construction are above average but nothing crazy -- still, good for the price. As other reviewers have noted, these do run small. My baby is about 10 weeks old, 14-15 lbs, and the 6-month fits her snugly. Size up!"
4,"Convenient design, but not very soft","Pros: These creepers have a really nice design. They snap up the front to dress the baby. They also have a large front-panel with snaps for easy diaper changes. I love clothes that you do not have to force over baby's head! They are not fancy, but fine for sleeping in, especially in warm weather.Cons: For a product from a company called ""SpaSilk"" I would expect them to be a little softer. I understand that the ad clearly says they are 100% cotton, so I am not at all complaining about the fiber material. However, the words ""spa"" and ""silk"" seem to suggest they would be a little nicer to the touch, especially for an infant.Overall a good choice for the price."
2,Didn't care for these.,"I didn't care for the styling of these in person. The look like they are on backwards since the large bottom flap secures in the front, and there are some REALLY wide gaps at either leg making them very awkward on our son."
5,"Beautiful, fun, and durable","This pony is absolutley beautiful....and smells great. My 4-year-old daughther LOVES SSC, and this is her favorite of all the ponies (I personally like Cookie Dough best). The accessories are easy enough for her to use on her own. She's had all 3 of the ponies for over six months, and they are still a favorite. Plus, they are durable enough for her 1-year-old brother to ""play"" with."
5,"Brilliantly witty, and a great story, too!","Shards is simply a great read. Piccirilli writes wonderfully; he doesn't just tell a great story; he fashions that story with so much style and humor that the reader hesitates to skip even a single sentence for fear of missing something. Shards is like a fusion of Fletch and Lethal Weapon; it's tough and smart and fast paced and spiced by some of the wittiest one-liners I have ever encountered. I liked this book so much that, having finished it, I immediately bought everything available by Picirilli, and have yet to find any book which deserves less than a four or five star rating."
1,Horrible,I thought this was boring and under-written. I had fun counting my yawns until I finally closed the book not even halfway through!
5,Thouroughly Enjoyed Aggie This Time.,"Nothing is more satisfying than a new Agatha Raisin mystery. This latest in the series is totally enjoyable. In this book we see Agatha involved in solving a mystery with a new paramour, but this one is apparently married. A new man has moved into James' cottage next door. He approaches Agatha to help lay a ghost to rest in an old cottage in a neighbouring village. Things get going when the woman from this haunted house is found dead a month or so later. Agatha and Paul set out to find a killer. In true Agatha Raisin fashion she bumbles and bosses her way into a solution. What a treat she really is!"
3,Average,"Not very well written, but entertaining, as usual. Syntax was a bit amateurish, really. Not as good as some of the others."
3,Not the best Agatha but still fantastic!,"I love the Agatha Raisin series; this one was not one of my favorites, but still, I love Agatha. She's real!!"
2,time to retire,"This is the fourteenth book about Agatha Raison, an early retiree who moves to the Cotswald from London. Carsely is a picturesque, quaint village. Agatha frequently gets bored, but luckily there is always a murder that she can investigate. In this outing, Agatha and her new next door neighbor, Paul, investigate who is playing tricks on grouchy old Mrs. Witherspoon, the owner of the haunted house. Before long, Mrs. Witherspoon is found dead at the foot of the stairs. Agatha likes to put her past public relations skills to use by helping the police. It usually lands her in trouble and this time is no different.I feel this series is getting extremely tired. Each book feels exactly like the last one. Agatha gets a new male neighbor, she starts to have romantic feeling about him, they investigate together, and by the end of the book they are usually on the outs. The characters have stagnated. The plots get recycled. It's time to retire Agatha permanently."
1,Where Is Orange Twist?,"My daughter loves Strawberry Shortcake and overall I approve of her interest in it and have bought all the videos and many of the toys but as an African American, although I bought all of the other dolls, I particularly wanted her to have Orange Twist and Orange Blossom. To my dismay, I have had to search high and low to find Orange Twist and although I don't want to pull the race card, what am I to think when everywhere I go Orange Twist is not there. It is very disappointing to say the least."
2,"Messy mane, doll doesn't fit, hair falling out","Too expensive!The hair tangles immediately - it is fine, not like MLP hair. Within one day, it was one big mess!! You can't brush it out like MLP hair, either!The hair falls out! One tug of the brush, and ...clump! It's out!Only the face has a smell, and it's not good.The doll doesn't fit.I threw the wasteful cardboard things immediately.The hair bands won't double...and they don't work as is!"
1,WhAt ThE?????,"this thing is absolutely gross and hidious! i'm sorry for being mean, but it is. well you can't really even move its legs or its head to much caz its so limited in movement which kinda sucks and is no fun. the thing came with scuncii's ( scuncii's where big in the 90's and i still thought they were UGLY!) and some other crap that was cheap and uuuugly. and then the thing smells absolutely FOUL, like ham gone bad or something (i kid you not!) it smells SO bad, it made me nausious, for real. when i put the thing down, the horrid stench was still on my handz, i had to scrub it off so i wouldnt throw up!!!!! please don't get this for a loved one, give them a my little pony instead :)"
2,The dolls won't stay on the horse,"This toy advertise that Strawberry short cake could sit on the horse but she won't stay on. It's frustrating for my 4 year old when she tries and the doll just falls right off. So, as cute as the horse is, don't believe the picture of the doll sitting on the horse."
5,Adorable pony! =),"I LUV SSC and the new fillie friends! They are darling, with such sweet smells and cute accessories, they are the perfect gift to ANY child, old or young....I have read the reviews on the stable for the fillies (Not good) But i am not listening to them.....So far, out of all the fillies, my favorite is Milkshake....I have honey pie and last but not least, Orange Twist! =) Come on...buy this pony and also Milkshake!!!"
5,This needs no batteries...!,"I ordered both of these ETs.. the 12""=no talking and the 13""=talking.The 12"" is nice because it needs no batteries, but is a little smaller and doesn't sit up as well.. and his magical finger is sorta yellow colored which looks kinda funny and yukkie.. but I think he is perfect for sleeping with and not accidentally making him talk and wake you up... Some of us are getting tired of all these batteries.. I use rechargeables which helps a lot.. but I don't like it if one of my talking friends begins to talk when I don't expect it and wakes me up...I think the 12"" is perfect for little kids to sleep with.. and you can buy a little baby blanket to wrap it in to sleep with.. ET often had a blanket on in the movie... :o) He likes to be cozy... :o)"
5,The new generation of E.T. plushes...,"Out of my vast collection of original-issue E.T. toys (including all the LJN figurines and wind-ups), I cannot recall any of my plushes talking. There were, of course, the plastic pullstring E.T. and the E.T. Talking Telephone... This was my first new piece of merchandise to coincide with the 20th anniversary, and I love it. It looks great on my shelf, and sounds even better. It is truly heartwarming when his heart and finger light up simultaneously when he says, ""Friend..."""
3,E.T.,"My daughter (3) was really afraid of this toy once she heardit's voice. She loves the movie, but the voice of the toyis a little scary."
4,Quite Different from Starry Bird!,"This book was quite different from Starry Bird, but I still enjoyed it. This was the introductory book for Johnson Johnson, and it's easy to tell as he's not as finely developed as he gets in future installments. The novel is still fast-paced, and funny in its own way. The singing bird of the title is Tina Rossi, a world famous coloratura soprano. The story is built around her illicit relationship with an English scientist. There sre plenty of twists and turns in the plot, and the story does not end at all the way I expected. Still a pretty good 70's thriller."
3,'Men with bifocal glasses: I spit.',"This is the first written of the Dolly series (published in 1968), but not the first chronologically. This novel introduces Johnson Johnson, a famous but enigmatic portrait painter who has far ranging and eclectic interests - and a beautiful yacht: 'Dolly'. The 'singing bird' is Tina Rossi, a leading coloratura soprano.For those familiar with Dorothy Dunnett's historcial novels, the Johnson Johnson mysteries are very different. Johnson himself is a recognisable Dunnett hero (enigmatic and multi-talented) but the contemporary settings can be disconcerting.The mysteries are well worth reading: they are fun!Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,How much???!!,"Bought this at Ross dress for less for 12 doll hairs, about 2 years ago. My boys like it and it's very durable AND not a chocking hazard ( hard to find fun for the big boy and safe for baby). But seriosly... how much??? does it has an antique value, as discontinued by manufacture :)?"
4,Great for 1yr and up,"[....]That is outrageously expensive to me. I had to do a triple take.However:My son loves these even though we have lost 2 already. He constantly comes back to the one we have left and plays with it at least twice a week. In the rotation it is definitely in the top of the list. He drops it constantly. No problem. It is the perfect size for little hands to grab. Definitely a good toy, but I would never pay even half of the Amazon listed price for it."
3,One of the better Slayers OVA's,"Lina and Naga are roped into saving a village from an Elfin curse. They meet some pretty interesting characters, and have an intense battle.Generally I am very unimpressed by all of the Slayers OVA's. My biggest beef is that Lisa Ortiz doesn't do Lina's voice in the OVA's. The animation quality is also pretty slack. Even so, I'm a fan of the series and this OVA. I think that the reason I like this OVA is the interesting characters. It's not as ridiculous as some of the other OVA's either. If you like Slayers, then you'll probably enjoy this little tale."
2,Disappointing...,"I had such high hopes for this book but was disappointed. It gives only a broad overview of pet-sitting and is absent of many specific, helpful details. If you are truly looking to start a pet-sitting business, I would pay a little higher price for a more thorough book!"
2,Scared me to death,I only was interested in doing this PT and it was geared for a FULL time business. Insurance etc. etc. If a pet should die. WOW too heavy. Made me decide not to go onward with this hobby.
5,Success writing at Work,The book came in a very timely manner and was in good condition. Very happy with purchase
3,eh,never really read it because it wasn't needed for class but it seemed useful. the person did not deliver it in the best condition
1,"Hillarious, total fiction","I do not remember ever being that much puzzled when I read a book. I have been visiting Turkey frequently and I can say being a U.S. citizen I have an objective view about the country, Turkish people and the system there. The book which can be only categorized as fiction is I believe written with a differnent agenda that Hayes had, but obviously not for revealing the truth.I am more surprised at the positive reaction it got from some groups all over the world. If they chose to beleive a story written only to blame a goverment to put a criminal in jail who both used and traded drugs, I have to say I have difficulty to understand in what sane state of mind they believe this guy who is trying to gain the sympathy of people by deceiving and lying them."
1,Lies lies lies from a drug dealer,"I do not remember having read such a ridiculous book which is being used to twist the truth inorder to show Billy Hayes as an innocent person-if smuggling is so please tell me- and to justify his blackenings against Turkey which do not have any firm basis.I am regretting for the time I spent to read that book. A smuggler is trying to be a hero and the villain in his story is the Turkish Authorities to catch him! WHat a scenario he creates with the sick lies coming out of his cocaine loaded brain. In Turkey else anywhere and also here in the U.S. a smuggler after a fair trial goes to prison and maybe in the U.S.he would be treated even with more strict rules, because Hayes could not stand being caught when he was smuggling something that poisons thousands of people, instead of admitting what hideous thing this was to do, he tries to use demogogue claims of him to look like an angel who suffered for nothing. com'on spare me."
3,Just not very exciting!,"I think I would have enjoyed this book more if I hadn't already seen the movie, which I now know was quite dramatized. Most of the exciting incidents in the movie, it seems, never actually happened. Big shock there. Overall the book was very good at depicting life and the absolutely terrible conditions in the Turkish prison system, but not a lot really happens. Lots of back and forth with attorneys and embassy staff, interactions with other foreign prisoners, the odd beating, but in my opinion, it kind of dragged. The ending which I expected to be heart-pounding, was merely a relief. Of course, having reached the end of the Kindle book, there was a plug to buy the sequel, but having read a few sample pages and determined it to be as equally as exciting as this was... I decided to give it a pass."
4,Great True Story,"Great Read. I would suggest it to anybody. Watch when you pick it up. If you have plans in a few hours, then you might wanna set an alarm."
5,Midnight Express,A very realistic book centered around other country's laws of illegal drug transportation. The story centers around an individual who gets caught with illegal drugs and is subsequently incarcerated. The conditions he must endure are horrific and his subsequent escape leaves one anxious for his safe return to his family despite his obvious guilt.
4,Chef John,"Very nice cooking pan, the non-stick is the best I have seen. The bottom thickness could be a little bit better. Good looking pan for hanging! Enjoy."
3,basic grammar,"In this book we can undesrtand the basic structure of the yoruba language. The book tell us some basic informations about this language, but it lacks someone to a better comprehension."
3,Warning!,"The tools are great... but the current price of over $1100 is a rip off. This same product was previously listed at $720. Either wait until you can get the deal or by from another place. This is way over priced.Edited: The prices really flux on this thing. One dealer put them on at a lower price, then removed them to jack the price up a couple hundred dollars. I would wait until the price is in the 700's before even considering it.After owning these tools for a few years I decided to amend this. Overall, they are great tools. They do the job well with wonderful battery life. However, the price flux gets a little ridiculous. But, completely worth the $700 price I paid for them."
1,Insane price hike,I wanted to buy this literary within the next few days. I researched this set for my birthday and it was $729 just a few days ago. Now it's half a thousand dollars more!!! You kidding me? This is such a disappointment.
3,COOK TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT ON LOW SALT DEIET,GREAT BOOK FOR SODIUM WATCHERS ONLY. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY OTHER NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION EXCEPT CALORIES. DON'T PURCHASE IF YOU WANT A COMPLETE NUTRITIONAL BREAK-DOWN. THE RECIPES ARE JUST OK.
2,not woth it,"This a great company, and other car or truck toys are good but this one is hard to play with for my 21 mo old and even my 3 1/2 yr old. It is well made but not worth the money. The Tonka trucks are better."
1,not worth the money-much smaller than the image-,"This car carrier is quite small 11"" long 5"" high-the photo looks like a much larger item. I paid $24.99 for the product-and at most I would pay is $10.00. Because the item is surely not worth the money that I paid, I have to pay to ship it back so I have to absorb these cost. I lost $3.99 by ordering this, the company should be ashamed of the price they are asking."
5,:),This is such a cute (not to mention funny!) play. It captures all of the Peanuts characters well and is also very much fun to perform.
1,"You're a Good Man, Chalie Brown","The book was listed as a play script, which is what I wanted, but when it arrived, it was some sort of 1960s souvenir book of the musical. I was extremely upset and disappointed and emailed the seller, who apologised and refunded the costs, including shipping. This was much appreciated."
5,Great game! Include younger kids by modifying rules.,"My 2 year old and 4 year old have played this non-stop since it arrived. In order to include my 2 year old, I changed the rules - dealt out all the tiles (weighted so my 4 year old had more to make it fair) and told them the first to find all their objects wins the game. More fun than the original rules, in my opinion. They have an endless attention span for this, and can play without my constant help, which is a lifesaver since I have a baby too. Highly recommended!"
5,A favorite in our Home,I look for toys that are going to last a long time and survive several children playing with them. I look for toys that will grow with a child. I look for toys that are easy to play with that do not need a lot of parent direction. I want a toy that will not just have a button to push to make it do something. I want a toy that will encourage creativity and exploration of the world around us. If the toy is quiet to play with even better.This game fits these requirements.It is a fun game. My four year old really enjoys this game. It is a game that my two year old can understand. Yet it is still fun as a family game. The game board sets up differently each time so the kids can't memorize where something is for each game. It is not a slow game so you can play a quick round or two in a short time and stop before the kids get bored.Well worth the money.Enjoy.Enjoy.
5,Finder's Keepers,My 3 year old grandaughter loves games and this one was a Christmas hit! She loves to play it with all ages!
3,Not yet Amelia,"Fans of Amelia Emerson should be warned: this is an entertaining, sometimes witty, and profoundly human story on a group of international visitors to Lebanon, Syria, and Israel in the late 60s by the future author of Amelia, but not yet the author of Amelia herself. In comparison with the Egyptological background of the Amelia series, Ms Peters research into Biblical Archaeology, even according to the standards of the late 60s, is disappointing. It is inconceivable that even a lay reader of 'Biblical Archaeological"", as the heroine is supposed to be, would not recognize the ciphers at her first glance; it is impossible to swim through the Jordan river opposite of Jericho and get on's mouth full of water, as the hero is said to have done (did he crawl with his nose in the mud?). The plot and the characters are not without interest, but in order to keep up with Ms. Peters later production, the novel would need thorough rewriting."
4,"Biblical history, adventure, romance--who could want for more????","Again I enjoyed reading another book by Elizabeth Peters. The settings were a regular tour of historic places in the holy land. I liked the biblical history lessons interwoven with the romance and suspense. And, as always, I enjoyed the touches of Ms. Peters' good sense of humor."
4,Dead Sea Cipher book,"Love Elizabeth Peters! This is a good, fun read without too much violence or nastiness."
2,sorry i bought it,"i am three quarters thru this book and no amount of money could make me finish it. what do people see in this writer? the dialogue is drivel, the characters implausible, and the situations unlikely, to say the least. so here somebody finds another gospel of the life of jesus. of course, this is accompanied by murder and skullduggery and an airhead opera singer (of all things!) heroine. i'm sorry. maybe if i were twelve, i'd think it was really cool."
1,Won't be finishing this book,"I've read 300 of the 362 pages and I can't be bothered to finish.Not particularly well written. The secondary characters are un-developed and annoying... in fact, the same can be said for the main characters. I don't care what happens to them. I don't care about finding out what the ""mystery"" is. I can't figure out how they could possibly have fallen in love. The author just springs it on you. It's a bit insulting to the reader, in fact.The heroine is passive and whiny... ""[spies (or whatever) are following me and I'm going to do nothing about it except wait for them to spring on me at every tourist site and ""ruin"" the tourist experience for me.]""This is my first book by this author, and unless I forget her name (it's a very bland, forgettable name) and accidentally buy something by her again, it is the last.I'm really glad I only paid a buck for it."
1,not worth the read...:(,"I'd read THe Love Talker before and didn't think too much of it but I figured maybe I was too judgemental, but then I read this one and I don't think these books are all that great. There is practically nothing on character development or any love growing...ooh I meet a guy and ooh I'm in love with one and not the other because...God alone knows why...Anywayz, I'm glad mine was a used copy! It was very boring."
3,Disturbing depiction of religion,"I enjoyed this book, although it has been at least fifteen years since I first read it. It involves the investigation of odd occurrances in England in the time prior to the emergence of certain non-conformists sects which later planted themselves in America. The Orthodox investigators have an encounter with spirits and have to determine whether they are demons or angels. The book is rather disjointed, but interesting in trying to depict the scientific investigation of spiritual matters in the context of the struggle in the English church at the time."
5,"A snapshot of persecution, prejudice and religious confusion","This book takes the form of interviews and narrative regarding the disappearance of a missing noble man. Others have complained about the slack use of UFO imagery - to me this is not important as the main character, Rebecca, is seen and treated as an outcast from the start. An unbelievable story unfolds and playswith ideas of what we consider to be religious or infernal. The characters are skillfully shaped by Fowles tofit the time - while we, the twentieth century readers, canmake judgements about the visions described in the book, the characters themselves are as confused and disturbed as we would be in the same situation. An excellent novel that encourages the reader to take all religious experiences with a pinch of salt..."
2,"Great writer that Fowles, but...","What the h--l were you thinking Mr. Fowles?In an effort to reclaim the time lost reading this opus, I'll be brief. Read every other Fowles title first, then after reading Maggot can you help me figure out what I read?Thanks in advance.E"
4,Wonderful 18th Century story coupled with bad Sci-Fi chaps.,"*A Maggot* contains the first bad writing I've seen from John Fowles. I hadn't thought he was capable of it. But he responds to the apparently irresistible temptation of British general fiction writers of the past 20-30 years -- he's just got to write SF. If you skip the SFnal parts (the Stonehenge ""flyby"" and Rebecca Lee's Ming-the-Merciless-esque testimony about the ""June Eternal"" people) it's a tremendous book, as unified a work as any of Fowles' others, very rich and thought-provoking. Readers not familiar with good SF may not object to Rebecca Lee's testimony. It is, however, hackneyed and illogical, not due to the 18th century filter, but due to the original vision which is being portrayed. Thomas More did somewhat better in 1516. The poor man is not even credited, which is so unlike John Fowles. I'm joking here - I can't understand the ""Ancient Astronauts"" inclusion in this book - otherwise, it is so good."
1,Did not work,We purchased this as a gift. The packaging looked great. It arrived quickly. For some reason the DVD does not work. Better luck next time.
3,One of his last !,"Delerue completed scoring this rather mean- spirited comedy only a few weeks before his untimely death in March of 1992. His music attempts to provide both humour and tenderness to the procedings, and I recommend listening to it apart from the film (which was a HUGE flop !)"
2,I expected better,"This roasting pan is disappointing to me. The pan is attractive but it isn't very functional. The handles protrude too far out from the pan, making it handle much larger than it is. It is easy too grab the oversized handles but for all the space it takes, I'd just as soon use a larger roasting pan. Further, the bottom is domed, not flat, so it isn't a very good surface for making sauces or gravies from pan drippings. The one saving grace for this pan is the non-stick surface."
2,roasting pan,Very poorly made. The non-stick surface came off with little use and no scrubbing. Ave your money for another product.
5,If you love Game of Thrones...,"...you'll love Touched by Magic. As with Game of Thrones, the magic doesn't overwhelm the story and the characters; it enriches them. Durgin populates her fantasy world with people we care about deeply, because they feel so real. VERY highly recommended!"
4,Growing Up Healthy: A Complete Guide to CHildhood Nutrition,"This book ""Growing Up Healthy"" , I purchased for my sister and she has Not given me her opinion one way or another. I thought she might like it since she is into healthy eating."
5,Great movie!,"They don't make movies like this anymore! Even though some of the acting may be cheesy, it just gives you that early 90's feel. The movie just has a good vibe, and it's one of those films that you must have. I love it!"
5,Great Little System,"Hisonic HS-120B Wireless Rechargeable Speaker P.A. SystemAloha, my group purchased this Hisonic 120B about 5 years ago. It is used on a weekly basis and carried around by various secretaries over the years. This system works well, is rugged, and easy to set up and operate. The price is reasonable for a relatively simple system and does the job.Jim Tomasi"
2,Marketing Vehicle,"This book is a marketing Vehicle for the Illuminations chain of candle stores. Although the photographs and arrangements are beautiful their beauty is sometimes created by the settings more than the candles or their light. Sprinkled within the pictures are occasionally interesting facts, such as the number of bees it takes to produce a pound of beeswax. However, such tidbits are also mixed with exultations to only purchase candles from a fine purveyor, assumedly Illuminations themselves. So I give it two stars for the scenic locations and the excellent photography."
2,A lot of the Ideas and Photos are Simple & Uninteresting,"A lot of the ideas and photos are simple & uninteresting. There were some scarce better ones, but there's plenty of the plain, uncolorful, dull ones, with little other than the idea of ""placing candles everywhere"". And most of the candles and their holders are boring looking also. Sigh."
3,So whats with the versions of the songs?,Good song lineup but why are there strange versions of Grey Cell Green and Kill Your Television here? Put the frigging singles on there!
3,Cheap not particularly fluffy,"My wife bought these for the kids who love to ""create"" things with them.My first impression is ""I can't wait to give these away to some cub-scout group"". They are not stunning colors or fluffy chenille. But they're cheap.Ya pays your money... ya gets what ya pay for."
1,Reading the what?,"This tape has nothing whatsoever to do with the skills involved with reading the wind. Shifts, direction, duration, puffs, lulls, etc., aren't even discussed. It deals only with how to run a genoa -- way too elementary and mindlessly obvious to anyone who's ever been near a sailboat. It's hardly worth paying the money to get tips like, ""...use a big headsail in light air and a little one in heavy air...""It's a sad commentary on the retirment of America's Cup skippers to see Robbie Doyle waste his time making garbage like this. You can get better instruction on reading the wind by watching Murphy Brown re-runs than you can by watching this video."
1,Misleading title,"This is a short dvd on some very basic, beginners' aspects of sailing. It has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with ""reading the wind"". I can't even recommend it for beginners who are learning to sail because it's pretty unfocused and doesn't cover much material."
3,Valuable for Prospective Sailers (even if mis-titled),"While the prior scathing review for this video accurately states that it has nothing to do with ""Reading the Wind"", that review seriously under values the content. Not everyone is an expert sailor like that reviewer. It's definitely not for experienced sailers, but is interesting and informative for the intended audience.The tape does have good, clearly presented, introductory material for anyone just starting to sail. Like other videos in this series, it is very basic, exactly what my wife needed after trying the ""hands on"" approach for a while. Robbie clearly explains terms and functions of basic sail handling processes and equipment. Taken for what it is, I'd recommend it to anyone just starting out, particularly if their sailing partners are ""old salts"" and take everything for granted."
5,An interesting perspective in a crowded landscape,"Out of the many available books on climate change, Ruddiman provides a refreshing perspective on the subject. His thesis is simple: human beings have been changing our climate since far before the Industrial Revolution. It all started 8000 years ago with the beginning of farming. He doesa good job at delivering his message on the science side but falls short on the more pragmatic side. He does not really answer the critical question of this debate: now, so what? he smartly leaves that to the reader. However, you are not really left alone in the dark since he gave some insights to make a more educated choice."
5,how to understand climate,"This book is a classic and a one stop read to understand the big picture of climate change- not just current changes. It is primarily about how to understand climate change over the long term (millennia and longer), and is written for the educated reader who wants to understand how the climate system works, why climate changes, and how humans are able to change climate."
2,Gory and predictable,"Aslover of horror fiction, I have read them all. I am not alarmed by graphic description or extreme bloodletting. However, this particular book insulted my sensabilities as a lover of horror. It was extremely predictable, excessively gory and filled with gratuitious gropping. Definately for the teen set.A great idea gone wrong."
3,Never ordered or read,I do not understand why Amazon ask me to review items I've never odered or reead! I They also don't seem to give onne the option to remove the item from the list either. so heres nothing.
4,Creepy and surprising,"This is the first Laymon novel I have read. It had all the characteristics I was told to expect: A quick start, a fast paced plot, bits of nasty violence, and some sex. Needless to say, I liked it! This is an entertaining and creepy novel. In overall effect, it is reminiscent of Jack Ketchum's ""Hide and Seek"" (which is fine by me too!)"
4,"Beautifully illustrated, wonderful story","As the previous reviewer stated this is an excellent book even for us adults! The colors were phenomenal and the ending made me cry! The only ""complaint"" I have is that it was a kind of long read for my 4 year old--he didn't pay attention for the time it took me to read the whole book. I'd still recomment it, though!"
1,Not Effective,I ordered one bottle of this product to test it out. I wanted a natural supplement to kick up my metabolism in additon to my exercise program.I have been walking one hour 6 days a week and have cut back on my eating. I did not notice any additional fat loss or weight loss from the use of this product. Any inch loss and weight loss can only be from the exercise and decrease in eating.Disappointed AGAIN!!
3,surface scratches easily,"I loved this pan until about a week after we bought it when the surface started scratching. We've never used anything but soft, plastic spatulas on it and we've been very careful with it. It now has a lot of scratches and a couple chips in the surface. Also there are four big bolts in the side which I have to scrub every time I wash it. I do enjoy cooking with it anyway and use it all the time."
1,Warning! Documentary,Just in case you were like me and thought you were getting a couple Godzilla movies. Don't get your hopes up this is a documentary about Godzilla and other old movie monsters.
2,"Too expensive, cheaply made","The horse is cute, but it does not have a smell (honey & spice) as the box said it would. The hair easily tangles, and when you try to comb it, it instantly falls out. We've had it one week and it's lost a lot of hair. A lot of the pieces are made of paper and don't even stand up - throw those straight in the trash. The hair bands aren't elastic enough to really work - it's hard even for an adult, so those don't get used much, either. (...)"
4,answer to a music fan from 14 januari,If you are a Music fan you don't rate This album just 1 star !! although a few music pieces looks the same it is GREAT !! and the songs is not Georges due ! thats the company's choice ! Besides This wasn't Georges last work !! that was the Black Robe !! how about being a Fan now !?? I am georges Delerue greatest fan !!
3,Malfunctioning answer machine,"I like the telephone and the 2 lines, but...The answering machine has 2 problems:1. It does not detect when the caller hangs up and keeps recording an anoying tone noise.2. Sometimes after you delete all messages from the machine, it still indicates that there are messages available although when you try to listen to them it reports that there are no messages. This persists until you switch on and off the power of the whole thing."
2,Still not impressed....,"I should have learned from my other Motorola handset phone years ago...they still don't really know how to make 'em like Panasonic. Sound quality is lacking. This phone functions but the buttons stick all the time on the base unit, the user interface is clumsy at best. Only decent feature is that you can have a different greeting for each line, you can set each line to anser or not, and you can access your messages easily, remotely."
5,Second Unit,This is second system in our business & it both have performed without any problems. The great part is that it does not interfere with any of our wireless networking which operates a 2.4 & 5 GHz.
3,If only speakerphon could be louder,"This is an expensive great phone with caller id, answering system and of course 2 line cordless with speakerphone at base and handset. So all in all would have been a great phone but for the voice volume. Even at the highest volume, you wish you could make it louder at the handset speakerphone. I use the speakerphone a lot and so those who primarily would be using the phone handheld- go ahead and buy it."
3,2 line cordless phone,"It took an inordinately long time for the phone to get here. The phone works well and I am pleased with it, just not with the length of time it took to get here"
2,Same experience as other reviewers..,"Dont buy this phone!This phone has all the bells and whitstles I needed. I work from my home office with two phone lines. I really like how easy it is to navigate between two phone lines with one handset.It worked fine for the first few weeks. Now, every so often it says it is ""out of range"" and my phone wont connect! Even when it is sitting right on top of the base! Just today, the phone went out of range while on a call just a few feet from the base and the call dropped!I have read reviews on other websites that had the same problem with this phone suddenly dropping out of range and not connecting again.On average my phone goes out of range for about 5 minutes then works again.I will be taking this phone back and shopping for a new one :("
2,Do not buy this if you are looking to expand...,"I am very happy with this phone, it works well and I get great reception. But I ran into a big problem when I tried to expand my system. I went online to find another handset/charger. The cheapest I found was a factory refurbished unit for $130, new units run anywhere from $250 to $300. Yet I can buy a base unit and 2 handset/charger (Model #7091) for $125. Don't know if Motorola stopped making the handsets separately or not, but I am really confused by the pricing to the point where I am thinking of just getting a whole new system."
3,"unreadable keys, short range, no mute incoming call","I liked many features of this phone but decided to return it because of the following shortcomings:1. When you are talking on Line 1 and a call comes on Line 2, you can't silence the phone. that makes it impossible to continue the call on Line 1 unless you leave the room.2. The speaker phone and redial keys are so small as to be invisible. I aksed my friend to look at the phone and turn on the speaker phone. After searching and staring for several minutes she gave up.3. The range is significantly less than my old Uniden 2.4 Ghz. I used them side by side. I lost the call on the Motorola while I still had a strong signal on the Uniden."
5,Pleasantly surprised at quality,"I purchased this phone to replace an AT&T 2-line phone that was fried in a recent lightning strike (in spite of 2 upstream lightning protectors) and have to say that the low price was a prime reason. But I have been very pleasantly surprised with the quality of this phone - it's much better than my former phone (which was four times the cost) in both phone quality, convenience (speakerphone on handset, caller ID on handset) and price. It was so good my wife insisted on replacing her working 2-line phone with this one, which I did. I have not delved into all the fancy features - but the basic phone operation seems very good."
2,Not for business use,This seems to be a fairly good quality phone. The handset is heavy duty. The answering machine menu/use is more complicated/tedious than it needs to be. The biggest problem with this phone system is that there is NO privacy feature. Anyone can pick up on a line while another person is using that line. Frustrating and unprofessional!
1,terrible,this phone constantly gives the person on the other end of your call a broken conversation. It breaks up like the conductor on the subway and calling Motorola got nowhere - they just do not want to know about it
5,Great Gluten Free pancake mix makes our favorite waffles,"We add ground flax, extra egg and shredded zuccini, and use olive oil for great waffles."
1,Too Dense,"I love a good pancake or waffle once in a while so when I saw Bob's Gluten Free Pancake Mix I was anxious to try it. As usual for Bob's it was easy to prepare and made really nice looking pancakes but when I put them in my mouth they seemed to just sit there, not fluffy at all, and so dense and with a slightly weird off-flavor that I had to put extra butter and maple syrup on them just to get them down. Keep working on this one Bob."
1,Not good.,"I'm sorry. I really wanted to like these. But they were just not good. I tried to choke down one when they were just off the grill and they are just so dense and grainy, I couldn't do it. It was like eating sand. So sad that such expensive pancakes were a complete waste..."
2,Funny aftertaste,"We recently took gluten out of my daughter's diet and this is the first gf pancake mix we have tried. My daughter wouldn't eat it and said it had a funny aftertaste. I tried it after she did, and had to agree.The mix itself is very easy to use and cooks up nicely. It just didn't taste like pancakes to us (even with chocolate chips added in). We will try some of the other mixes to see if they have a better taste."
1,worst taste ever,"I had so much hope for this product. I had the hardest time getting the horrible bean taste out of my mouth. If you make the mistake of trying it, drink some milk. That's the only thing that help. Otherwise if you can have rice, look up a good simple recipe using rice flour. That's what I do now and they are wonderful."
1,Not Gluten-Free,"Just a word of warning?Lots of celiacs have trouble with this--it will depend on how sensitive you are to gluten. Bob's Red Mill is probably legally gluten-free--20 ppm, or close to it--but it makes enough people sick that you have to wonder.If you are still getting sick and you are eating this, or you are feeding this to a gluten-free kid who is still getting sick, either you and a substantial portion of celiacs on various websites are ultra-sensitive to the small amounts of gluten in this, or it's not actually gluten-free."
4,Not horrible.,"Tried it for the first time last night. Not the worst pizza I've ever had, which I guess is saying something.Tips - Keep a bowl of water by you when you spread it out. Your hands need to stay wet. Also, press it down as thin as you can. I think this makes an enormous difference. Some of my pizza had thick sections that tasted spongy and thinner ones that were crispy.Follow the directions. Some of the negative reviewers clearly did not. Saw that someone tried to use a pizza stone when the directions say to use an oiled pizza pan."
5,Great mix!,I prefer my pancakes from scratch but in a pinch these pancakes hit the spot! They freeze well after too so any leftovers can be re-heated and served which is nice for kids on a school day!
1,Bad aftertaste,I agree with other reviewers that comment on a strong (and bad) after taste. Not sure what it is. Maybe it's picked up by some taste buds and not others...must be since there are so many positive reviews. If I'm using a mix instead of going from scratch (with the Artisinal Gluten Free Cooking cookbook) then I like King Arthur Flour pancake mix the best.
2,Barely passable,"Add me to the list of folks who doesn't get the good reviews for these pancakes. They are not delicious. They have a strong corn texture (sort of a cornbread pancake), they are extremely crumbly. They are dry. They are neither light nor fluffy and really barely even passable for pancakes. I added fresh blueberries to ours and that was the only saving grace. Really very not good and I won't buy this again.There are so many genuinely great GF mixes these days, I don't know why Bob's Red Mill couldn't do a better job on this mix. 2 stars are just because they are easy and edible. Maybe I could have turned the mix into something good by making a million modifications, but that wouldn't really be a review for the pancakes made as the mix recommends, would it? Though I am glad some people have found a way to make this mix better."
4,"Good, but a bit heavy.","I decided to give this a try as my husband makes Sundays' pancakes for our family of seven. Surprisingly we realize that the mix makes very dense pancakes, the kids notice a detectable corn flavor, we added a little organic sugar in the mix, good flavor but definitely not as fluffy as other brands."
4,Bob's Red Mill Gluten- Free Pancake Mix,"Bob's Red Mill Organic High Fiber Pancake & Waffle, Whole Grain Mix, 26-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)My wife has to have Gluten-Free products and I eat them myself as I do most of the cooking now.We are very much pleased with this product's taste and texture.Sincerely,Charles Fickling"
2,not very good,I did not like the taste of these pancakes. They had a funny taste to them and left an after taste in my mouth. I have only been on a gluten free diet for a month now but still you know what you like. I have to say nothing compares to the GF Bisquick mix. It is just like the original Bisquick hardly any difference at all.
5,The best,Far and away the best gluten free pancake mix I've tried. It works perfectly with flax meal meal and soy milk substituted for the eggs and dairy.
2,Not THAT good,I don't understand why everyone says these are sooo good - they smell and taste like the bean flour - which is very hard to mask - and they are grainy - not at all like regular wheat flour. My husband won't eat them - and my kids complain when I make them - The only thing I like about them is that they are fluffy.
3,better pancakes than waffles,"I love all of Bob's products, but this one doesn't seem to quite measure up to his usual offerings. The waffles I made with it didn't come out nicely browned, and had a baking powder aftertaste. My 3 year old ate them (the one who can't eat wheat), so that's good. My 7 year old ate them, and then politely asked if next time she could have the waffles daddy was having (Bisquik!). As pancakes, they work quite well, though they are on the thick side. They work equally well with regular milk, soy or rice milk. I love Bob's gluten-free flour mix, so I might try making waffles with that and seeing how it works."
5,Try adding pumpkin !,I get these for my son and he was not big on them at first. So I added some pumpkin and that made the difference! I prepare them with almond milk and cook in coconut oil and they are now a staple!
5,The only pancake mix we will buy...,"Pancakes preferences are pretty personal. I agree with the reviewers that say this mix results in a somewhat dense pancake -- and that's why we love it!!! These pancakes are not rubbery, floofy, sickly-sweet UFOs. They are tender, creamy, soft, lightly sweetened, solid, and absorb syrup well! Leftovers are great room-temp as open-face peanut butter sandwiches."
2,Too general - where's the beef?,"Way too general. I was looking for more detailed and specific installation & tuning help for Postgresql database on Linux. The book provided a quick overview and the high points, but certainly not enough to get the product installed & optimized. It's coverage of GUI tools provided only an overview, with not enough info to even persue it."
2,Not very satisfied.,I purchased this costume along with 2 others in the sailor category. All were shipped with buttons falling off. I spent a lot of time reinforcing every button on all 3 costumes. One button fell off and I was unable to find it. I contacted the seller with my grievances and was never contacted.

3,Could be great but...,"No doubt that the magnet part is great - super strong with lots of holding power. However, in the two sets that I bought, most (10 of the 12 total) have fallen apart in that the magnet slips out of the plastic holder. This most commonly happens when taking something down, you pull the plastic piece and the magnet stays behind. On close inspection, I notice small cracks radiating from the recession that holds the magnet. It appears that ""Magnutz"" expects the items to hold together with a friction-fit; probably an OK assumption as long as the plastic cover is not cracked. If you are willing to epoxy the magnets back in, they are great, and hold together perfectly. Having said all this, I would buy these again, knowing that I would probably have to re-seat all the magnets."
1,The Abyssinian - Abysolutely Awful,"A long book filled with stereotyped, puppet-like characters, either all good or all bad, and with an ending that is predictable from the 2nd chapter on. Sorry."
2,interesting but disappointing,"Yet another interesting concept, well begun, but ultimately retreating to cliché. The first half of the book is quite good - detailing the travels of an embassy from Louis IV to the Negus (emperor) of Abyssinia in 1699. The novelist makes good use of the intrigues and mistrust among the various Catholic and other Western factions. The hero is a young herbalist whose medical knowledge gives him near miraculous powers, and provides several easy escapes from intricate plot devices. But these sections do impart a good sense of what it might be like to travel in these then unknown parts of the world, down the Nile, through Egypt and the Sudan, and ultimately to Ethiopia. (A good map would have been handy for this, as the areas involved are not well-known, even today.) But, about half way through, the descriptions and background can't hide the predictability of the plot, and the Candidean romantic subplot detracts from the overall effect."
2,a little predictable,"This novel does have pretty prose, romantic characters, and exotic locales. But the characters seemed like stereotypes from a Harlequin romance and it was easy to predict how the book would end. A disappointment."
5,Call this worthy advertisment...,"I feel compelled to review this book in order to inspire others to read it. The book provides a rich and rewarding reading experience. Loaded with history. Loaded with adventure. Loaded with romance. ""The Abyssinian"" is brilliant adventure. For educated readers who often feel cheated by the cheap thrills so common to popular fiction, this book is a godsend. Every page teaches and awes and thrills. Of course there are limits inherent to the adventure genre, but this novel so often transcends the genre with its barrage of detail, research, well written descriptions, and well drawn characters that it is first and foremost an intelligent work of literature. Lucky for the reader, it is so darn much fun to read!"
3,Good Historical Work,"This was a very ambitious work and the writer pulled it off. It was a chronicle of the French attempt to colonize Abyssinia, now Ethiopia. It was a vivid account of the cultural life of Abyssinia before and during early contact with the west. It had very little to do with romance, or rather perhaps because of the era, (year 1699 through 1702) the romance in the story was very subtle. Nonetheless, this reader wanted for the hero, Poncet the apothecary and the heroine, Alix, daughter of French ambassador in Egypt to get together. It is a voluminous and detailed work. The small type and close line spacing made it difficult to read but if you like historical novels with well-paced plots, this book is for you. By the way, the book was so successful that the author wrote a continuation titled The Siege of Isfahan."
1,"useful book, bad binding","Contains useful essays on collecting theory and practice. Good enough that I would like to assign it for an upper level art theory class. Unfortunately, the binding was so brittle and poorly glued (on a brand new copy) that it started to come apart almost immediately. After a bit, I would read a page and, as it detached from the spine, simply discard it. Finally, I packed it all up and shipped it back to Amazon (who gracefully refunded the price in full)."
4,I love Satellite!!!,Can't get enough of that song. The lyrics are fast and the beats are kickin' so it makes for an awesome upbeat and energetic progressive vocal dance track. The rest of the album is just as good. This album is best listened to late at night driving really fast through the empty streets. Or maybe an after hours house party where everybody is drunk stoned and getting down.
3,AFFORDABLE WITH ACCEPTABLE RESULTS,"IT WAS THAT TIME,I HAD BEEFED UP MY RAM,VIDEO CARD UPDATED TO A NEW VERSION OF AOL,THE TIME CAME FOR A NEW MODEM.I READ UP ON SOME OF THE MODEMS BUT I HAD NO IDEA WHAT I WAS FACING WHEN I WALKED INTO THE LOCAL COMPUTER STORE.BRANDS OF MODEMS I NEVER HEARD OF AND MY CONCERN WAS IT GOING TO BE THE RIGHT CHOICE? 3 CLERKS GAVE ME 3 OPINIONS WHICH DIDNT HELP.I FINALLY GOT THE CREATIVE MODEM 5630.IT BOASTED PNP,WELL THIS WASNT THE CASE,AFTER 3 TRIES I GOT IT TO LOAD THE DRIVERS AND THE OTHER ADD ONS WHICH WERE A PLUS.INTALLATION WAS 10 MINS TOPS. MY CONNCECTION SPEEDS WERE INCREASED.I RARELY CONNNECT BELOW 48000BPS.DEFINITELY AN INCREASE FROM 44000.ASIDE FROM THE PLUG AND PLAY DIFFICULTY I WOULD SAY IT WAS WORTH THE PRICE."
2,May have problems with XP,"Have been running Windows XP. XP recognizes it as a generic fax/modem and answers the phone everytime it rings as a fax interfering with incoming calls. Creative has not released a driver for XP. It connects about 30 to 50% of the time on first try. Once connected the connection fails about 50% of the time. Have tried to get help from Creative, but nothing yet."
4,"Cute, but nowhere near as good as the movie","I've seen the movie, and I really love it. I don't really feel the same about the book. It's very different. Maybe if I had read the book first, I would think that the movie is too different, and not like it much... however, it is still a nice book, and without it, there would be no movie.One thing I liked a lot in the book was the flower scene. Again, done differently than the movie, but still good and the flower's way of talking in rhymes was fun to read. I also love the poem at the beginning."
2,Not as good as the movie,"Yes, this is one of the rare cases where the movie based on the book is better than the book itself. I felt that in an effort to make the characters more 'appliance-like' the author totally eschewed any characterization. The characters are rather flat and boring, with almost no individual personalities. They do not even have names, rather going by 'the toaster' 'the lamp' 'the blanket' ect. While most of the plot points are the same, the ending is vastly different than the movie's, and almost an anticlimax. The fact that you can buy the movie at almost any video store and the book is out of print IMHO speaks volumes. I gave the movie 4 stars. The book barely makes two."
4,i liked it!,it was a good book. i just don't think it was the best. it was pretty colse to the book. i've seen the movie many times. but if you liked the movie(witch i really did not like that much) you'll like this very good book.
1,DO NOT BUY - PAL REGION 5 FORMAT - WON'T PLAY ON US EQUIP.,"REALLY ZERO STARS. This DVD is not playable on US Region 1 equipment. Package states PAL format, DVD 5. Amazon deducts return shipping fee from refund. Should not be offered or sold to US customers."
3,It serves a purpose but not built to last...,I was looking for a bag that was just big enough for my netbook and some other gear while traveling that wouldn't take up too much space under the seat in front of me and be light to carry over the shoulder. This was a perfect solution. Now there are some buyer beware factors. The bag is cheaply made and what can you expect at this price. One of the zippers broke on the first day. I am a bag hoarder so I will just buy a replacement before I travel again.
5,Years of ownership and one issue resolved by warranty.,"The shoulder strap has a soft cushion, it continually comes apart until I just took super glue and fixed it. The company has sent me 3 straps and it just comes apart the same way. As for the bag, what more can I say than it has saved my macbook and now macbook pro 13"" from sudden death by airport messes. You know how you carry your life in your hands, have to go through security... My bag fell with the macbook inside and nothing happened...it fell to the concrete floor. I love the bag, I hate the strap pad, it makes me angry that I email the company and nobody has addressed the issue in 2+ years. The easiest production fix would be to reinforce the pad on the strap and then I would rate it a perfect score."
4,Nice Slick Bag,"it's an awesome bag, the only thing i would suggest is getting a sleeve for extra protection incase of you having to walk in heavy rain. other than that, it's awesome, many compartments, comfortable, protective... except after the flap, there's nothing else keeping from elements from getting inside. still very happy with the purchase though"
4,Good customer service,I had a problem with not getting a refund and their costumer service department was prompt and courteous and refunded everything back.
2,Great bag... if you dont take it in the rain,"I've had this bag for 4 months now. It is a nice looking bag, and also has a nice light and small design. It fits my notebook, power chords, and notebook-mouse just fine without looking stuffed or too thick. In fact, I really liked this bag until one day...It was a rainy day. I packed my notebook as usual, stepped outside assuming all would be protected and safe. However, if you look carefully, the flap that swings over the top is not made to wrap around the edges. There is an angled gap of roughly half an inch on both sides of the flap, that provides direct access to the notebook.Luckily for me, it was a short walk to the car in very heavy rain. when I opened my notebook bag, I discovered water on the edges of my notebook. And now, I have to always remember to stuff paper towels on the edges just in case it rains."
4,Good bag for computer and a book,"I bought this bag in order to carry little more than my macbook - and it is great for that. There are a couple of additional pockets for accessories, but none are quite adequate for the bulk of the power adapter. The design of the case is sleek, following the pattern of the macbook itself - a not very thick rectangle. So writing pads or notebooks, trade paperbacks or hardback books will fit nicely, as long as you select no more than one of each.I'd buy it again."
4,Using for new MacBook Air,"I've been using this bag for a new 13"" MacBook Air. While I like the general appearance, the cell phone attachment (on the shoulder strap) felt clunky and got in my way - so I removed it (nice option to have). Bag holds most items, but a specific area for power cords would be a nice addition. Although the bag is rated for 13"" screens, the thin nature of the computer allows a lot of space in the computer compartment and therefore, it bounces around pretty significantly - a supplementary pad for such thin computers would be welcome (or perhaps a smaller compartment for this specific computer).Overall, meets my basic needs, but I am not blown away."
4,Comfortable bag for a comfortable price,"I love this bag! Very easy to use and carry around. You can hold it or carry it around your shoulder. You can also put some of your notebooks, pens, and other items. You can also put your cell phone on the side. The only downside is that it is not good with rain. So you have to extra protect your laptop when it rains. Overall, great product!"
5,Stainless Dream Pan,"I own several pieces of Cuisinart Stainless, but only a couple of non-stick one. This is my favorite. I use it fry fish, chicken or French fries. The pan heats evenly and cooks everything to a crisp golden brown. Since I only use is for frying clean-up is a breeze--just pour the oil out and wipe with a damp cloth."
1,Poor picture quality,"This DVD does not have good picture quality on a 50"" LCD projection TV. The picture quality pixelates at all screen sizes. I rate this DVD ""no stars""."
5,"""A sweet simple book for all ages""","""...Lisa Ober's masterful collection of comforting pastel paintings bring to life this loveable character in Angel of My Own. My son Christian loves it."""
1,This is garbage,"If there was a negative star scale, it would be more appropriate. This is absolute crap. Trent should feel insulted that sh*tty industrial bands are trying to ride on his coat-tails and so should NIN fans. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. don't even think about it. Just listen to the original NIN versions."
2,Don't bother.,"This tribute wasn't really worth the money. Some of the songs aren't bad, especially singly or in otherwise small doses, but as an entire album, it gets tedious. I couldn't help but wonder how so many different bands could take songs quite distinct from one another from ONE band, and make an album that overall sounds like one run-on, distorted song. Even the art in the booklet was melodramatic and cliche. It didn't capture the spirit of Nine Inch Nails, in my opinion. But it probably could have been worse, so..."
2,tributes are mostly something you can 'say' you own...,"I own five NIN tribute albums, and I never really listen to any of them. but I just gave them all a listen again, and I think this is the best among them. which is not saying much. the only cover I like on here is the one by anno daemonicus (latin for 'year of the demons'?) some kind of black metal band. but then the only reason I like it is probably because it reminds me of a 'Cannibal Corpse' album called ""the bleeding"", so I can see why others find this track unpalatable. I like syncretism, so the final track which was a cover of 'into the void' & 'the day the world went away' together was alright as well. anyway, only buy if you are an extreme fan who doesn't mind that they just purchased a permanent place filler for their CD shelf."
1,Crap!!,This was a horrible cd. I am upset I bought it. If you are an avid NIN fan you will be disappointed too.
3,Go-Go Days,"This is by all means a heartfelt reminder of what is was to fly commercial in the glory days of reciprocating engines and, particularly, the early period of jet travel. Passengers actually dressed well, and indeed, cabin crews had sufficient time and resources to make even the longest haul an adventure. It succeeds as a memoir, but falls somewhat short in an over-dependence on advertising images and magazine copy. On balance, it is a fine thumb-through for a Sunday afternoon: TWA and American Airlines in their original liveries; PSA; Eastern . . . How sweet it was."
1,"give me a l, give me an e, give me a g.......","tawry. not much on the services andconsiderations that the stewardessprovided, but a slick leering exposeof short skirts, and coifed haira carry over of previous books bythe author on beauty pageants andcheerleaders. cheeky"
2,omission,"Plz pass this along to your author -- I was a flight attendant for 39 yrs --- I started with Northeast Airlines ""Yellowbirds""in Boston Massachusetts in 1966. Our competitors were Eastern, National and Northwest airlines; New Englnd to Florida ,Bermuda and many cities on the east coast .I personally did many uniform presentations one of which was a full page ad in the new york times -hats, mini -skirts ,gogo boots , split skirts w/ shorts underneath ---Very sad you excluded us . We had a very illustrious beginning and were eventually taken over by Delta Airlines ."
2,Good for looking at the pictures,"There is not much writing on this book, but the pictures are a blast from the past. I liked looking at the pictures, but this book is only for aviation fanatics."
1,"AN AWFUL, AWFUL BOOK!","THIS IS A HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE BOOK! LOOKS LIKE A STEPHEN KING WANNA BE WROTE IT AND PAID TO HAVE IT PUBLISHED BECAUSE I KNOW THERE ISN'T A PUBLISHER IN THE WORLD WHO WOULD TOUCH THIS CRAP!!!"
2,Not Happy with this phone,"1.Battery has no life2. ""Strange clicking"" (sounds like someone typing on a manual typewriter) sound when engaging phones dial tone, (this noise does go away after conversation starts) Phone lines also checked by my phone service vendor, the noise is from the phone, not the phone lines.In general I spent a lot of money for the base and expandable handsets, and the product has performed poorly to date."
2,Poor execution of good ideas,"This phone has many features that I really wanted--ability to add addition hands sets, shared phonebook, speakerphone on each handset, 5.8 Ghz DSS. I didn't find any other phone w/ these features even though, to me, they seem like minimal features in a modern phone. Anyway, I am really disappointed. Each feature is poorly executed such that it is really a pretty lousy phone. The shared phonebook is a nice idea but so hard to access and find the number that its really quicker to dial the number yourself. The voicequality of the handsets is inferior to every other phone I've used. The only (sorta) exception is that the handset speakerphone voicequality is even worse. 5.8 DSS is nice, but the range is short (doesn't reach out to my driveway even though my baby monitor works fine in that location). I recommend that you not buy this phone. Wait till another company implements this feature set in a better phone."
2,Not as per my Expectation and Price,"I used this phone for four weeks and then returned it. The volume was really low and it was really very difficult to hear the person on the other side. Then the battery started discharging very fast and could not not last for more than 20 minutes off the base. Instead of buying a new battery, I chose to return the phone even if I was refunded store credit and not cash."
3,Not as good as it should be.,"I got this phone about a year ago, maybe a little more, after a decent search through other reviews. However, I was dissappointed once I got it home and working.Pros:- Setting up the additional sets is easy enough.- The phone works and you can easily adjust the ring tones.Cons:- If you talk at a normal tone the phone will drop out your voice. I had to talk directly into the mic and at a louder than normal voice.- The batteries lasted for about a year (maybe that's a long time I don't know, but it didn't seem like it).- Now, after about a year of having the phone, when I try and answer it the phone just quits out.- The additional bases comes with their own stands. However, these stands are very light and get knocked over very easily. All it takes is you to slightly miss putting the phone down on the base for it to knock over.- When the phone dials the number it does it so loudly, that you can hear it from across the room. It doesn't matter what you have the volume set at."
2,"Good for 12 months, poor afterward","I've had this phone for 20 months and have been disappointed in it's reliability. We have used 3 batteries for each handset in 20 month. Each battery has a useful life of about 6 months each before losing a charge in just a few minutes. Even with a new battery, a charge does not last but a couple hours before needing to be recharged.Calls are sometimes routed directly to the answering machine without first ringing the telephone.One handset may ring but the others may not; this may be related to battery issue but it does happen even with new batteries.There are other, more reliable phones. Go find 'em."
3,"Older model, but nice for the money","This phone replaces my SD7561 which was a 2006 Moto phone. The answering machine on that phone stopped picking up, so I thought this phone would be compatible. Meaning, I thought I would be able to use the base unit with the satellite units I already have. I was wrong, even though this phone looks like the one that is compatible; this phone is actually a 2005 model that is a little bit bigger. It doesn't have all the functions of the SD7561. You can not assign different ringers for callers, I don't even think it has a call list.Bottom line, if you can find this phone for less than $40, and you don't want anything fancy, then this will be an okay phone. If you use your landline a lot, don't buy this. Get one with more features for a little bit extra cost."
2,"Unsuitable for gas: unstable, uneven heat (electric OK?)","A good format for a small pan: enough for 1-2 fried eggs, or a small sauteed garnish or side dish, all that.BUT this is not the right pan to buy if you use gas.First of all, it is unstable. It is fairly stable on a flat surface such as a countertop or an electric burner, but on most gas burners, it will be unstable and tip over when empty or near-empty. The handle needs to be lighter, or the copper disk heavier.Secondly, the copper disk on the bottom isn't wide enough. Gas flames lick up the sides, and so you have a too-hot ring surrounding the part that is over the copper disk. This is very obvious if you fry an egg. You have to turn the heat much too far down to avoid this.I suspect it works reasonably well on electric burners, but I haven't tried.For gas, I'd recommend you get a pan that doesn't just have a copper disk, but is solid copper or aluminum."
4,Great little pan for one....,I use this pan all the time (flat top electric range) for 1-2 eggs ...sausage...burger etc. and I love it. I wash by hand an sometimes ..dishwasher(but not with heat drying). The non stick ...the stainless steel looks as good as the day I bought it.Tips....do not cook dry....always add a little fat...season it.Do not cook at max heat...not necessary...give pan time to warm up. Avoid metal untensils even tho they suggest it. Do not cut foods in the pan.Too many people destroy their non stick pans/pots.Some cheap non sticks are not worth buying unless someone has tested and has given a favourable review.
4,A fun folk opera,"For the in-depth review, see Scott Morrison above, who obviously knows this material a lot better than I do.Basically, I bought this album because the Polka and Fugue has always been one of my favorite pop concert bonbons. You can't listen to this without breaking a smile, any more than you can listen to a Rossini overture and not feel good. There is such a thing as humor in music, even without lyrics.If you remember the Polka and Fugue fondly, by all means buy this set and enjoy the whole opera."
3,If only we had a better performance of this delightful opera,"Reviewer Robert Fliss hit the nail on the head when he said (referring to the Polka and Fugue), ""You can't listen to this without breaking a smile, any more than you can listen to a Rossini overture and not feel good."" The Polka and Fugue may be the happiest music ever written. And the same can be said about the whole opera. What delightful music, and what a marvelous plot!It is a total mystery to me why this once famous and often performed opera has fallen into such oblivion, even in the Czech Republic. It is sad that this performance seems to be the only one now available on disk, for it just isn't very good. (Compare Fritz Reiner's recording of the Polka and Fugue with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra with how these sound in this performance, and you will see what I mean.)Still, having this recording is a lot better than having nothing at all. (I've given it three stars for effort, though it really doesn't deserve it.)"
4,Exactly What I Was Looking For,It was so sweet and had the best ending. i loved the characters and the side story of her brother. Really good!!!<3
1,Liars,"The problems and the practice tests were helpful. Aside from that, the cd does not do anything at all. It does not have practice tests that are accessible anywhere. It takes you to their own site which has nothing useful on it."
5,Much better than the TV show,"This OVA is infinately better than the TV show. Better storyline, better comedy, better fan-service. My only complaint is that like most great OVA's it is too short with only 3 episodes. Still, get this if you can, and forget about the TV show."
3,his books are much better,"I remember his two great books: 451 Fahrenheit, andMartian Chronicles. Naturally, I was much youngerat that time (in the 60s), but this series is very different.Very strangely, his style had changed, and the filmsthemselves are very different from each other."
2,Insipid,"I bought this series expecting something like Amazing Stories or Twilight Zone, but RBT is way below.Most of the stories were insipid, kinda low budget and lack the interest we are used to with AS or TZ.I stopped watching it halfway on the third DVD...I rated 2 stars because it is worth mentionning that this series featured some great actors, but beside that, don't waste your money on this set"
2,Mmmm not so good,"I think this dvd it's not so good, a little boring and naive maybe.A few stories are good but most of the dvd stories are zzzz....."
1,ID-EE-OTS!,"Why spend 32.00 on a DVD that you can get for 12.99 just a click away. And why give this a positive review and that a negitory! Are you the same people that said Buying Star Trek for 150+ was a bit frivolous? Nerdy sci-fly channel child prodigy,hippie-crits!"
1,quality is awful,"the quality of this set is awful,,i'm a big fan of this show but when i try watching it i just get that gut feeling that i've been ripped off,,very sub par for this day and age"
4,The Ray Bradberry Theater Collection,I liked the collection of the Bradberry Theater. It brought back memories. He had some interesting concepts and his stories about Mars are so different from todays sifi stories.
3,"Some episode are good, some are bad.","Some of the episodes of this show were pretty good and had the sort of mystery that you'd expect to find on shows like Twilight Zone or Tales from the Darkside. Some of the episode were bad and made little to no sense or were just plain dumb. This is really a hit or miss show. However at it's price it's worth buying just for the good episodes, the problem is having to watch them all to find out which are which."
3,Good show-lousy packaging,"This DVD is the most lousy DVD package ever. THey put all 5 discs on a single spindle inside the case. THey didn't even put numbers on the Discs! They could have at least done that.As for the show itself, it's pretty good thus far-as of this writing, I have four more episodes left on the first disc. THe DVD transfer is good-if not great. The Audio is better in some than others. There's a total of 65 episodes-averaging 13 per disc. Here's the problem: To put that many episodes on one disc(Which total 5 hours per disc)you have to use more compression-the more compression, the less quality there is. That is why on a show like this, there should be no more than 8 episodes per disc. If there were 9 eps on one disc, that would make 8 discs.I think my rating is very generous-I guess I love this show. If there are future releases planned of this show(I doubt it)please improve the packaging and use more discs."
5,Very cool set!!,"I love anthology shows like the Twilight Zone. While I grew up in the 1980's I actually never watched the Ray Bradbury Theatre. I picked this up on a whim because i had seen a few episodes online. I recieved the complete show for under $10. where else can you get a complete show for this low of a price? I watched the first two shows and watched it for audio and visual quality so I could do an honest review. This is a great set with great audio and a clear picture. It is worth more than the $10 they sell it for. If you like the Twilight Zone, you will love the Ray Bradbury show (Who by the way, wrote an episode of the twilight zone). This series is comparable to the Twilight Zone but alot cheaper!!!Buy This set! Very cheap entertainment"
4,A great value!,"It's great getting 65 episodes for such a low price. Also, I agree with some of the other reviews that some episodes are better than others.I started out watching disc 5 (volume 5) because it was on top. However, most of the weakest episodes, imo, are on volumes 4 & 5.Regardless, there were episodes that I have remembered fondly for many years, that have held up well.Specifically:""A Sound of Thunder""""Hail and Farewell""""The Veldt""""Mars is Heaven""""The Black Ferris""""The Long Years""""The Playground""""The Screaming Woman""""The Lake"""
3,Cant complain for the price,"Even though the series is highly compressed, the video is still watchable and if you like this type of content the price is right."
4,I like this product.,"This is a pretty good product. It is like it sounds, and it is good to watch it for some cheap entertainment. I remember seeing these on the USA Network, and it was good watching them again. A few of the dvds have parts that mess up, but not enough for me to send it back. The complete collection doesn't cost a whole lot of money, and they are a good source of entertainment if you like his work. I am a fan of Ray Bradbury, and his stories are good. I hope anybody who buys this boxed dvd set enjoys it too. My favorite episodes are entitled ""The Playground,"" The Long Rain,"" and ""The Lonely One,"" ""Silent Towns,"" and ""The Handler."" I hope this review helped somebody in their decision-making process."
2,Terrible Transfer,"I bought this in hopes it would be similar to Tales from the Crypt. The stories are OK. Nothing to write home about, but that is not my complaint. They put 65 episodes on 5 DVDs! That's 13 per DVD. The video is so compressed it looks like you're watching a bad VHS copy of the show. The quality of the image is terrible. I would say that if this is available on VHS and you still have a VCR to buy that instead of the DVD version."
5,Ray Bradbury Theater,"If you are a big fan of Ray Bradbury don't miss out on this awsome collection. I bought it a while back and I love it. My favorite story in the whole collection is called ""The Lonely One."" The next would have to be ""The Screaming Woman."" I love the whole collection all though these are my favorites in the collection. Buy it if you love Ray Bradbury because you will not be disappointed.VLH"
1,"I Love Ray, But The Show Falls Short","Though there are some good entries in this series, most are not on target. There are some episodes that are downright corny. Most of the stories are much better to read rather than watch. Buy it anyway because Ray Bradbury is a nice fellow."
2,A few good eggs don't make a dozen,"This series is extremely dated. Take it from someone who watched these air originally. And it's not a ""good"" dated like having watched the Twilight Zone over and over again. It's more like watching the movie Cujo twenty five times. How many times can you watch the dog attack the car in slow motion? Terrible. Not worth the few good eggs in the basket."
4,"Really good, but just a little lackng.","Ray Bradbury Theater is uniquely Bradbury, and that in itself qualifies this series as top rate science fiction. Dark disturbing stories are made emotionally distressing for the viewer through dramatic camera angles, superb lighting, and top quality acting. Bradbury Theater is not Twilight Zone, not Hitchcock, and not Outer Limits, but just as these shows have their unique and characteristic signatures, so does Bradbury Theater. Where Twilight Zone is clever, Hitchcock unexpected and Outer Limits strange, Bradbury is twisted with a hint of the demonic. If you are a Poe fan, you'll just love the queasy disemboweling feeling you get watching these plays, but not late at night, or just before bedtime."
4,Ray Bradbury DVD,"Can't beat the price of over 60 episodes of half-hour stories. Some are outstanding and some are just okay. There are so many, so you don't have to worry about being bored. Ray is one of the best storytellers of our generation."
2,"Good stories, bad DVD","While the series was enjoyable, the DVD's themselves are horrible. Never mind the bare-bones menu with squashed icons who looked like a child who didn't understand perspective put them together (William Shatner, for example, looked 100 pounds lighter, which, for him, wasn't so bad!).You then click on it and the quality looked like someone ran a video tape through a tape-to-DVD converter that they bought from a local discount store. Grainy, pixilated, and when viewed on a PC, it appears that it was not meant to be viewed in full-screen mode at all.The colors are muted. There are no extra features (one of the reason that people buy DVD's). This is produced by some cheap company that didn't understand quality.While I am glad to have the movies, I am unhappy with the quality. The price should have reflected this."
4,It's all here.,"The Ray Bradbury Theater makes it to dvd. All the episodes are here, however they are not in order of air date, it doesn't list the air dates and special features are obsolete. If you like the show it's well worth owning, but it is by no means a definitive release."
4,Sensitive and Moving,"Wineberg delves into essential elements of the human condition: desire, loss, survival,and redemption. With sensitivity, she explores the inner world of intimate relationships. Her stories are moving and filled with descriptive details that draw one into particular lives that resonate with emotion."
5,Sammy's Awesome,"I always wanted to hear Sammy's solo stuff after hearing him with Van Halen. I got this for Christmas and I was shocked how much i knew. I never knew he sang the over the top song (Winner Takes It All). Heavy Metal , Fast Times at Richmont High,and almost every song on this collection is good. This is one of the best collections I bought in a long time. I recommended this to any hard rock fan."
4,Good collection but not great.,I became a Sammy Hagar fan after he came into Van Halen Istarted checking out his solo work and was really impressedwith what had done as a solo artist. Best tracks are:-Fast times at Ridgemount High-Winner takes it all-I can't drive 55-Bad motor scooter
3,Good Idea That Just Missed...,"If your going to call this ""The Essential Red Collection"", then why not make it a double or triple CD worth of Sammy's whole career? I'm sure somewhere down the road, there will be an anthology collection released with many of the same songs recorded here. I gave this CD a passing grade, on the strength of the 2 ""unreleased & the 3 motion picture soundtracks"". Until that time when a larger version of Sammy's career is released, pick this up, crank it up, and enjoy."
4,The best of slammin' Sammy.,"The best of Van Halen AND the best of Sammy Hagar in the same few weeks? Hmmmmm. Anyway, If Sammy's your man, this is a great collection, and depending on what you want, it's probably better than his previous hits disc ""Unboxed"". Not only is this 20 tracks, but some of those are ""Bad Motor Scooter"", ""There's Only One Way To Rock"", ""Give To Live"", ""Mas Tequila"", and the ultimate driving song of all time ""I Can't Drive 55"". Plus there's a couple good soundtrack songs: ""Heavy Metal"" and ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"". I don't really miss anything besides ""Three Lock Box"" and ""When The Hammer Falls"". Overall, I think this album will live up to your ""High Hopes""."
4,Fans of Sammys career,"If you are a fan of the ""Red Rocker"" than you should enjoy this collection of his music spanning his career from Montrose all the way to the Waboritas. I thought it was good sampling of his work thus far."
4,All these songs of the ARTIST - WOW,"From Montrose to Halen to ChickenFoot to blowing it away solo, the Red Rocker is the best and delivers...see who he is and listen and enjoy!"
5,red rocker keeps it real,Most people go through the motions of montrose then sammy hagar me because of this cd I just discovered montrose and glad I did a lot of people can criticize him for the van halen thing but they should keep in mind while he was their he gave his all and this collection proves it from bad motorscooter to mas tequila he brings it as only he can the favorites of read heavy metal there's only one way to rock and fast times at ridgemont high reminds us of his haydays as well as i cant drive 55 your love is driving me crazy. this is a great disc for any rockers colletions the only problum is this should have had THE TRANS AM song in it. Not only does this disc reminds us of good quality rock and roll but also proves sammy did it his way and made it.
5,the essential red collection,"A great album. It has all of his best music. I only wish it also contained ""Trans Am"". Otherwise, it's excellent!"
3,They've almost got it right,"The basically took the best of Unboxed and threw in a Montrose track, two unreleased, and all of his movie contributions. They've almost got it right, but a two CD set is what Hagar really deserves."
3,Could use a bit more finesse,"Purchased this wafflemaker to replace a smaller villaware unit that had broken. This one ended up being a little disappointing. It is not as deep, so the waffles are not the nice thick one's I've been treating my family to on the weekends. I thought the 4-up waffles would make things go quicker, but if you use a thick batter, it takes too long to spread it evenly across all 4 sections."
5,Awesome! waffle maker,"I used to make Belgian waffles on the stove with an old, heavy waffle maker. I got flaky, crisp waffles but it took time and a lot of practice to make the kind of waffles one gets from this waffle maker. While my previous method was not very forgiving, the Cuisinart Belgian waffle maker produces evenly browned, light, crisp waffles every time. I am extremely happy with this Cuisinart product and recommend it highly. Have fun!!"
2,Flawed design,"I've been through two of these in the past three years, and I believe the design is inherently flawed. The first one stopped working in the middle of cooking a waffle, about a year ago. To Cuisinart's credit, they honored the 3-year warranty even though I didn't have an actual receipt (I only had the credit card statement that showed the store where I bought it) and replaced it within a month at no charge. The second one just died a few weeks ago, this time the thermostat won't shut off, which could actually be a fire hazard. If you look closely at an actual model, you'll notice that there's a couple of small holes in the upper handle housing that will allow steam to make it through to the thermostat circuitry, and indeed when you cook a waffle you'll get steam coming out from the temperature control knob area. I believe that sooner or later this causes something to short out in the thermostat circuitry. I wouldn't buy another one of these, although they do bake a good waffle."
1,Flimsey construction,"Bought this as a replacement for a 10 year old villaware 2-slice. For starters, it is not as deep so the waffles aren't as crisp. Second, the handle in front is too short, when you go to open it, be careful of the steam! The plates do not come out for cleaning. There is a cover on the back end where the hinges are; they are held on by little plastic tabs, and they broke within the first week, exposing the connectors in the back. I'm very disapointed with this model."
4,Ondaatje's childhood was full of splendor and heatbreak,"This book explains a lot about Ondaatje's background and the surroundings that may have led him to the life of a poet. The collection of ""tales"" has a touch of magical-realism, as though they are still looked at through the eyes of a boy. Very different from the English Patient, a lighter read, easy to put down and pick back up. One chapter a night before you go to bed will give you delightful dreams."
4,"The ""other"" books...","After having the wildly successful ""The English Patient"" under his belt, this author and poet of Sri Lankanheritage is wonderful to read. While this book is not really about travel, it is a collection of short montages and recollections wrought by two trips back to Sri Lanka (he now lives inToronto.) Very mellow and very dusky, and rich with characters and anecdotes that make families the exiting beasts that they are."
2,Very disappointing,"After Anil's ghost,I had high hopes for this book. It is a rambling account of paying homage to a father whose image the author was trying to restore. this is no ""Roots"". It is an account of shameless family insensitive to everyone around them. The storytelling is very spotty too."
2,Irritating,"Ondaatje seems to be trying too hard. The language is overly flowery and the plot is often lost beneath the mound of words. It does have a few good moments, some funny, some touching. But in general, I spent most of this book irritated by the grandois manner of the author, as if by writing in a vague and pretty-fied manner, his words will sound important and deep.Maybe it's just me, but I find that vague does NOT equal meaningful."
3,Tigers,"The times in the recent past that we have read about Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, in the newspapers has concerned the Tamil Tigers who have finally been crushed and one wonders if they were fighting against a government controlled by Ondaatje-type people. The author's father was such a dedicated drunkard that its possible he actually was schizophrenic. I like the author best for his humorous detail but he never seems to get hold of a story too well and kind of staggers around with the shreds of it. At the end, I wondered was Doris his mother name or his stepmother's. Kudos to his mother for actually leaving his father and going to England where she earned her own living. The author doesn't think much of her but I do. What a brave woman. Is the author also a drunkard, I wonder?"
2,"Abstruse Organization, Soporific Content","Upon finishing the first few chapters of this book, I was left confounded by the poor organization of the chapters and material. This is not an esoteric review, but rather I am speaking for all students that have read this book. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. It is one of the most worst books to read. STAY AWAY."
3,The phone itself is fine,"This phone works. The driver is a minor issue unless you have a Mac.For those who complain about delays in voice, the phone is not the one to blame. You need to learn how VOIP works before making your statement. IRAQ is not next door. For a network packet to prapagate to Iraq, it has to travels thru hudreds of hubs. 15 seconds sounds long but not all that unreasonable considering sattellites are involved in the transmission."
2,Headset & Mic Just As Good,The phone works great and I would give 5 stars but. I purchased one for $20(good deal)and set it up on my XP machine with no problems after getting the latest driver from US Robotics website. I returned it because I was still teatherd to the PC so I figured why bother with the USR handset when my Skype UI was in front of me on the monitor. A little earbud with a mic I have that came free with another piece of software worked Skype just as well for me. I have an extention plug from my sound card so I can easily change from the earbud to my PC speakers on my desk.Save your money for a few more paychecks and get the Linksys CIT 200. Its cordless and works great with all your contacts or direct dial out from the handset anywhere within 50 meters of your PC. I have the CIT 200 setup on my MCE computer and it works flawlessly. I can even watch TV and talk on the CIT 200 at the same time.
2,Pretty neat... but utterly lacking.,"I got the skype VOIP phone because I heard about it while I was in Iraq. People were talking through the computers with the one's they loved, like some kind of futuristic videophone. It pretty much does that, and the fact that you don't have to pay any connection fees (unless it's a call to someone else not using Skype) is nice, but there are a few downsides. One, there is a major delay in the transmission; you can say something in the phone, and it will take like 10-15 seconds before it arrives on the other end. Also, you have to keep it connected to your computer with your computer online if you ever want to recieve unexpected phonecalls from loved ones; otherwise you'll have to make arrangements with them to be online at the same time. Ultimately, it is a very usefull tool if you have limited access to hi-tech communications (like in 3rd world foreign countries), but at the same time you may find it more of a hassle than a boon if you use it like a home phone."
3,Feels great on skin but....,"It feels nice and soft on skin and smells good..but it can't help any discoloration using that only. You have to use retinol, aha, hydroquinone, or something else besides just that wash. I personally have yet to find a good hydroquinone product to remove my uneven skintone issues..when I do I bet the face wash WILL enhance the effects though."
5,Grandson loved it,"This review is from: Star Wars R2-D2 / Jabba's Palace Transforming Action Set (Toy)My 8-year-old grandson loved it. His dad said it was good to see him get into the ""old school"" Star Wars (as opposed to the Clone Wars). For a while, I watched him play with it as he investigated all the nooks and crannies. He tweaked it to expand into something else and then collapse back to a smaller, different form. The many pieces allowed him to make up all kinds of stories. His mother suggested this gift because he likes anything Star Wars. He did like this one."
2,"disappointing, breaks easily","My son does not play with his toys very roughly, but this toy breaks constantly. it looks cool, but is very disappointing"
3,Solid,"One of the DVDs in the set has some bad sectors, but the others work fine. The music CD that comes along with it is a little tedious to just listen to, but if you're dancing along, I can see how it would be great. The DVDs are fun to watch, but hard for me to follow along. This isn't really beginner level, although I had the impression it was."
4,Fine product,"These little mice seem well built considering who their target audience is. My kid has fun dressing, undressing, posing these little things. The only thing I think is lame is the clothes slide off the creatures' shoulders continually. This does not bug my child at all. But it does bug me. Maybe I can affix the world's smallest velcro piece to fix it, but it would be nice if the little family had clothes that stayed on."
4,cute,"My daughter loves this set. She dresses and undresses them all the time. They've accompanied us on many outings. We don't have any other calico critters nor calico critter houses, etc. They work well on their own with my child's wild imagination."
5,The BEST Toys Ever!!!,"My grandma and parents bought me this set along with the Whiskers Cat Family and a few of the Calico Critter twins sets. These completely posable, fuzzy, dressable, and lovable creatures are the best toys you can find anywhere! I am almost 12 years old and I spend hours playing with these little guys in my dollhouse. My parents even enjoy them too! If I could reccommend the best toy for kids, Calico Critters would definitely have to be my choice!"
4,A very good toy for a careful child,"My daughter loves Calico critters animals, and she plays with them very carefully. To that end, the Norwood family is a great neighbor to all the other families we've got. But I did have to fix many things once her friends came over and played with those: kids who are a little less careful find it difficult playing with those without tearing little parts off. I would say it is a great toy for kids who are around 5 and have good small motor skills, but not for younger kids (although I must admit my younger one is 4 and has been playing with those since she was 2.5)"
4,Great For All Ages,I really enjoyed this book and wanted to keep reading to find out what would happen to Jecosan. This allegory/fantasy book would be great for parents to read to their children. Interesting plot and good to have characters with strong morals portrayed.
4,Delightful and Entertaining Story!!!,"This is a delightful story that begins a trilogy for the adventures of Jeco Tarres. Jeco Tarres, who is an orphan, receives a commission from the Lord of the Heavens to go to Kanavar where he is to enter the King's Service. Along this life-defining journey for Jeco, we learned about his character, also his best friend Dalian (who is strong-willed & hot-headed), his loyal companion, Gart (a golden retriever), and the obstacles they faced.The story moved quickly and the author did an excellent job of weaving the spiritual elements into the novel without it becoming preachy. I'm looking forward to reading Book 2 of the Trilogy and I recommend this novel to kids from age 9 and up and to adults who wants to read a good story."
3,Entertaining story written at 3rd grade level,"As a children's book, this story is quite an acceptable Christian allegory. However, most adults would find the characters wooden, the writing style juvenile, and the parallels with Protestant Christianity overly obvious. Personally, I would recommend theChronicles of Narnia Box Set- an infinitely superior piece of literature- to help ingratiate young ones to the Christian fight.On a side note...did anyone else find the author's incessant use of the word ""smirked"" irritating?!"
5,A Must - Read for all,"""The Adventures of Jecosan Tarres"" is a must-read for anyone with a love for adventure, excellent character development, intrigue, and a love for people. Jecosan is a most wonderful and pleasant little boy with impeccable character who leads us through his life adventure in a new land and culture we have never before heard of. The characters seem real and the book would be appealing for boys and girls and adults. Highly recommended reading for all!!"
5,Very enjoyable,"I was not at all surprised when I read it in an interview with Laura Lond, the author of this book, that her favorite author is Charles Dickens. The story of Jecosan, although set in a different world, has a definite European touch to it, and that special feel you get when you read a good classic. I enjoyed Jecosan's strength of character and his pure heart. His big dog Gart steals the show sometimes, and his quick-tempered friend Dalian the blacksmith throws in a few funny lines once in a while, as well as a few punches. Telm, a spiritual being who has temporarily taken on a human form, will give you some food for thought and make you wish you could sit down and talk with him. Overall, this book is a great read suitable for older kids, teens, and adults."
4,Lazy Man's aquarium,Great fish tank for those who don't want the mess. I play it on my widescreen plasma. So realistic it would probably fool Sylvestor
1,Boring,"This video is boring. I was replacing my Ultimate Aquarium Video, but sadly, this was an unsatisfactory video. I will go back to my old worn video. Sorry."
1,Disappointed,I ordered this video expecting a variety of aquariums and fishes. This is shot from a single aquarium which has only a few fishes. It looks like the video is shot using a tripod from an aquarium which any kid can do. The video is just converted to a DVD format(The print on the Disk says that). For this money it is a real waste for home viewing. May be good for TV/DVD sales shops for display purpose.
3,a journey about time and memory,"Tarkovsky is a great filmmaker that work best with the time and memory ! this film is about his journey in time, his journey in Italy becomes a sacred journey like many others russian great artist in the past time. A film that you must see , just if you want to understand better Tarkovsky and his idea about film , memory and time."
4,Inspiring Autobio,"Geri Halliwell certainly has balls for writing her life story when she's only 26. But what a story it is! We learn of her short-comings as a child in Watford, the pain she went through trying make a relationship with her parents and many other hardships.The thing I like best about this book is its inspiring core. Geri tells the horrid details of being bullimic and anorexic,but how she fought her battles and strived to become a better woman.The thing I dislike about the book? She tends to drop a few names here and there. Debbie Harry...Courtney Love...Madonna...all women who helped pave the way for Geri.In the long run, although she's not that old, she certainly has had one hell of a story so far; one that should not be missed by anyone seeking some personal inspiration and something to 'lift them up.'"
5,WORTH A LOOK,"THIS BOOK IS A TRUELY INSPIRATIONAL BOOK FOR ANYONE TO READ. THIS BOOK GOES DEEP INTO THE SOUL OF A STRONG WOMAN WHO STARTED WITH A LIFE OF ALMOST NOTHING AND WENT TO BEING IN ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFULL FEMALE BANDS IN HISTORY. SHE DISCUSSES HOW SHE DEALT WITH LIFE AND GROWING UP, HER TROUBLE WITH AN EATING DISORDER AND HOW SHE FOUND THE STRENGTH TO START HER CAREER OVER AFTER LEAVING THE NUMBER ONE POP-BAND, SPICE GIRLS, RISKING A LAWA-SUIT AND LOSING ALL THE MONEY SHE HAD EARNED, ALL SO THAT SHE COULD LIVE HER LIFE THE WAY SHE WANTED, AND HOW SHE HELPED THE WOMENS BREAT CANCER FOUNDATION. THIS BOOK IS WRITTEN SUPERURBLY AND IS A MUST READ."
4,Great book,"I was very curious about this book, I wanted to know why Geri left the Spice Girls, and I also wanted to know about little secrets about their life as artists, what did she think about some of the things the other girls did, live concerts, and things like that, and she doesn't really talk about these things. So I was a little disappointed. But the book is great, and I don't regret buying it."
2,If Only...(I hadn't picked up this book),"So, I admit it. I read If Only. And I also admit that I cried. I wept mostly for the lost time, but I also shed a tear or two for the wasted potencial of this book. I'm not a Spice Girl fan, but I do admit that tumoltuous lives intrigue me. Marilyn Monroe, Princess Diana, Geri Halliwell. The memoirs are rambling, redundant and incoherant. Between the fluff, however, are moments of joy, sadness, and insight. Brief moments, mind you. If you're willing to to read through fluff without wearing the rose tinted glasses of a Spice fan, you may find it worth your time. Not likely, but one should never say never."
2,If only I didn't buy the book,"What a waste of money and time!!!! Geri Halliwell only demonstrates what an egomaniac she is and reinforces beauty stereotypes. She is doing her young readers an injustice talking about her bust size, looks, etc. Very superficial! And her supposed problems with bulimia were almost an insult to someone who has been struggling with it for 16 years. In short, save your money and watch Cinderella-it's more convincing."
2,Not a Good Use of Talent,"I bought this CD out of curiosity, knowing it would not be the type of song I'm used to hearing Charlotte sing. It's difficult for me to rate it because this is not my type of music. I think Charlotte deserves 5 stars for being brave enough to try something new, which is why I give this CD a very generous 2 stars. But I don't like this CD at all! The synthetic music drowns out her voice and the lyrics are dreadfully repetitive. This is a good example of why some pop artists get away with not being able to sing well.If she is going to go pop, I'd much rather see her do Celine Dione type songs. This is not a good use of her extraordinary talent.But hey, maybe I'm just too old to appreciate something like this."
5,2 Quart Sauce Pan,"This is a wonderful little pan. I find I use it more than any other pan. It's especially nice to saute vegetables and with the high sides, it's easier to toss the veggies to turn them over."
4,SMART BAG!!,"I bought this after borrowing a friend of mines STM bag. I like his more because it has more pockets, but his was bought in Brisbane several years ago.Alas, this bag is still the best laptop bag i have seen since.Quality construction and great price point make this bag a winner."
4,STM Bags Alley medium,"I saw the picture of the bag and liked it instantly. It is exactly what it is described to be and the size is excellent for a 13"" computer. A bigger computer would leave little room for any other accessories (power cables etc). Has enough pockets for necessities like pen drives, notebook - small folders - all you need to get you off on a work trip. The colour and fabric is excellent, but not water proof. Highly recommend it for frequent travellers."
5,Great bag,This was a great bag to travel with holds everything and is easy to carry fits in overhead on plane
3,"Bag meets a need, but assembly quality is below average.","I specifically wanted a vertical laptop bag with fewer pockets and lightweight carry. This bag fits the need perfectly and has a fine shoulder pad. Overall design is simple and utilitarian. The sections & pockets are fewer but very large and can carry almost anything. A negative is that after 3 months of daily use, the inside laptop section divider fabric stitching has started to break and separate through normal use. This also reveals the thin polyfoam construction of the internal divider. At best, this is okay and a compromise for weight and cost, but given all the other design & assembly compromises, I wonder if this will last a year or 2 without becoming an annoyance?"
5,Delightful Classroom Resource,"Although not a teacher, I can see that Peterson's books are terrific classroom resources. As an avid fan of holidays, I'm particularly drawn to AROUND THE WORLD THROUGH HOLIDAYS. Peterson's ideas and illustrations offer a fascinating roundup of cultural celebrations in several countries. Scripts for plays to be presented by class members carry two intrepid young explorers through visits to each of the countries to learn holiday traditions from the natives. Peterson makes it easy and fun for teachers to follow Readers Theater productions with curriculum-related, holiday-themed parties for their class."
1,Get something else.,"I hate this stroller. Yes, it is cute, small and folds up easily but the cons far outweight the pros. The basket is useless. It is too small and your baby cannot be in the stroller while you put something in it. What I dislike the most is how it handles. It will not stay on a straight path and the handling is bad. I am forever running into things in tight stores. It is not just me, my babysitter (sister) also hates my stroller. I will be purchasing a new stroller as soon as my baby outgrows the carseat for it. I don't like that either. The buckles are very hard to snap together."
3,A disappointment,"Basket is not very big, if you put anything inside it will drag the ground and rub against the tires. The width is a great size for shopping. The recline position is great but when sitting the child up its a little difficult. If I would have tested this stoller out in the store I would have not purchased it."
2,"Light, but handles poorly","We got this stroller as our primary, and while it has many good features, we ended up not using it primarily because the handling on urban sidewalks sucks. Also, we ended up missing a parent tray and a child tray.Pro: comfy for child, nice recline, light, folds well, includes infant bootCons: terrible handling, small basket, no parent tray, no child trayWe got a used Gracco Metrolite for $35 and are much happier. We do still use this for travel."
1,A nightmare,"This stroller is terrible. I purchased it after an in-store test drive and I liked it because the seat was roomier than some others and it seemed lightweight and easy to tote around. After less than a month the wheels (which are cheap and wobbly) had already loosened to the point where it was next to impossible to maneuver it. My daughter is only two but she is tall and her feet easily reached the wheels which is another detriment to trying to push this thing around. The basket underneath is tiny, forget about stowing a diaper bag or even a purse in there. The bar for pushing is very narrow and if you are more than about 5'4 forget about pushing it without having your feet hit the wheels, my husband could never push this thing and I was just short enough to get away with it. In short...not a good buy. I have only had mine for about two months and I am getting a new one ASAP."
3,Still awaiting refund on return,"This is not really a review of the product itself, but rather a comment on the return policy and our experience. We returned this item well over a month ago (not quite what we wanted) and we are still waiting for our refund. Calls to the number on the invoice go unanswered. Beware if not buying directly from amazon."
3,This Book is Well Edited,"This book traces the development of rheumatology treatment practices in the United States. Many American doctors who have made breakthroughs are identified. The book is well edited and the editors outlined it in a concise, chronological and helpful manner for students training in the discipline of rheumatolgy."
1,History of Rheumatology of the United States,"This book was not what I expected. I believed that it was a History of the speciality itself and not from a specific country, which could be important, but not for all of us. Knowing the root of ourselves make us a better persons and doctor in my case. When I saw the title in the book I received I felt dissapointed. So, if you want to know the History of Rheumatology do not buy this book."
5,Best ever,This is the best honey I ever had.Had it on NCL cruise and when I got home look for it to buy.
3,Share the sweetness,"Great Service! Wonderful- well promised & delivered Before I expected! Tremendous pacakging that hit the mark for our recent Jewish New Year! The addition for the dinner-table along with floral arrangements, miniture challahs, candles, & fruit (tooting my own horn-here!) really good-I was a little dissappointed with the flavor of the honey- not what I expected; but then again I'm not an expert of the many nuances of the-bee & it's ability to produce the golden necture."
5,Wealthy and Wise: Secrets About Money by Heidi Steiger,I found Heidi's book excellent. All the chapters were informative and gave outstanding advice. Accumulating wealth is half the battle - having wealth help you to live a happy and contented life is the other half. I will definitely be using the advice within the book and will recommend this book to all my friends.
3,handle gets warm,The handle got warm when I prepared food which I don't like for home use. A better bet is a a pan whose handles have a heat-resistant covering. There's no lid and the pan is not as deep as I would like.
2,chintzy,"I was looking for an inexpensive collection of dance music to get my toddler moving, with some of the catchy songs that I remember enjoying as a kid. These CDs have some good songs (my toddler really likes ""Celebration"") but the kids singing the songs sing in what I call ""Barbie doll voices"" and are a little off key; personally I find it spoils the fun. Also, the arrangement lacks energy, in my opinion, so it doesn't encourage dancing as much as it should. Apart from one or two songs my toddler didn't really notice that the music was on. A major problem with the unprofessional presentation is that the CD numbers aren't written on them so when you pop one in you don't know which collection of songs will play. I had to label the CDs 1,2,3, with a sharpie. I won't be buying any more ""pop 4 kids"" stuff."
1,Pretty Much Worthless,"I don't know if the program is the problem, but this book was not easy to use or helpful. It seems to just repeat the help screens, which are also worthless."
5,"But seriously, folks...","...But seriously, folks, this is just about your only printed choice for 121 regs besides the ones from Jeppesen, which are ONLY available by subscription (not printed in any book format). Of course you can download them from the FAA.I have been very pleased with my FAR/FC from ASA. The two-column format and readable font are easy on the eyes. What more can you ask for? There certainly aren't many pictures! You might as well order it from here, preferably sharing the shipping cost with something else that you really want, and save yourself the tax + the $... markup at your local FBO."
4,Still Very Relevant for the Modern Reader,"""Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains."" - probably Rousseau's most famous line. The Basic Political Writings contains four key works:* Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts* Discourse on the Origins of Inequality* Discourse on Political Economy* On the Social Contract (where the above quote is from)Rousseau was certainly controversial 250 years ago when he first was published, and because of that, remains both interesting and relevant today. His admontions on governmental action, democracy, authoritarianism, ""progress"" and religion are all relevant, and make one think. Though certainly not onsidered a moderate in his day, Rousseau's position would largely be considered the middle way today."
3,No page numbers,"I bought this edition for Kindle (instead of the less expensive one) because it said it had page numbers matching the print edition my classmates are using. Turns out, no page numbers. Returned."
3,Attention Poly Sci Students,"This book contains 4 of Rousseau's works: Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts, Discource on the Origin of Inequlality, Discource on Political Economy, and On the Social Contract. In his writings, Rousseau theorizes about the state of nature of man before civilization, a time before any societal influences governed his actions. He then explains how man left this initial state of nature to form society's. According to Rousseau, reason and cooperation, which led to the sciences and arts, are what forced us to leave our happy state of nature. Based on the state of nature, Rousseau then goes on to relate how man is in a society and what an ideal society should be. Enjoy your reading..."
4,One of my fav workout DVDs,"I really like the segments with Bob, Tara is ok, and I generally skip over the awkwardness that is Sione. It's low impact, and I find it to be one of those workouts that you can make easy on the days you're doing good to get off the couch or harder when you feel gung ho."
4,Not just for beginners,"I am an in home walker, I have done most if not all Leslie Sansone workout. I was wanting to try something new as far as in home walking. This has definitely added some variation. I have only done workout 3 and I was drenched after the 16 minutes. Bob does lots of knee lifts, lots of jogging in place, mixed with jumping jacks. If you like in home walking give this a try, it is not just for beginners. It is a straight forward cardio workout without complex moves, it serves its purpose in 16 minutes. I look foward to the trying all 4 of the workouts, one includes weights.I also recommend these workouts for the time crunched exerciserLeslie Sansone the big burn intervals of jogging and walkingLeslie 5 day slim downJackie Warner personal training30 day shred"
3,"Good basic walks, terrible cool down/stretches","I've been doing Leslie Sansone videos for years, so I found this to be similar to her routines, although not as enjoyable. But it is nice to have a change of instructors & casts, and I enjoyed the fact that you can customize your workout by choosing which and how many miles to do. However, there really is NO cooldown, you just stop and go right into stretches, which I do not like. The stretches were also very brief & somewhat awkward for me, so I am not a fan of that portion of the workout. I don't watch the show, so that doesn't affect me one way or the other. Overall, a decent workout DVD."
3,Mixed reviews - could be better,"The good:Variety (for a walking workout) - 4 different miles. Lots of moves, some with weights.Modifications are shown for low and high impact. You can bring this workout up to a solid intermediate pace.The cool down is chaptered separately.The bad:The set is really dull. I was looking forward to an outdoor walk, but this is just a crummy lawn with clumps of dirt all over.The music is really bad. I like that there is a music only option, I just wished I wanted to hear it. I will use my iPod.My pet peeve - I hate when intructors walk around instead of doing the workout (Bob) - it's just walking - not rocket science."
3,Good,"I like the individual walks, it allows to you fit in a short workout when you are very busy. However I didn't like that there wasn't an option on the menu to play all 4 miles you had to go back to the menu and play them all which made me feel like I was losing momentum...other than that they are fine."
3,"Easy, fun workout, but not very challenging","I would say this is a beginner/intermediate workout, but it is a good, fun workout. The first section is very slow moving and didn't get my heart rate up. Section 2 was a harder workout with weights along with the cardio/walking portion. Section 3 was pretty intense and got my heart rate up, but only after I made the walk/jog portion more intense buy doing butt kicks/high knees instead of the jogging. Section 4 uses a medicine ball; I like the fact that they use the medicine ball, but again, it is slow moving. There was no part of this workout that I dreaded, it was fun and pretty easy. I would do it on a day where I wanted a light workout."
3,"Okay, but I found one better","I have to admit, I do not own a lot of walking videos. This was my first purchase. We have used it and continue to use it, but I found another video that I like better. The second mile is lead by a former Bigger Loser contestant. He and the lady that he is talking to are highly annoying, in my opinion, and greatly takes away from the enjoyment of the video. It does work and works well. I just prefer a video that doesn't make me nash my teeth to follow the instructor."
5,Power Walking Indeed!,"I ordered Power Walking because I wanted to supplement my workout. I thought it would be easy. There was no ""taking it easy"" with this DVD. I thought I did power walking but this was a whole new level of walking. I tried it out yesterday and I will say it is an excellent DVD for Beginners. If you don't finish the whole mile then do what you can and gradually build up.The current season people are in this and several others from earlier seasons. Tara and Simone (from a previous season) do the cool down.It has a three week program to follow in which by the end of 3 weeks you will have walked a marathon (27 miles). There are four 1 mile walks about 20 minutes long and a 5 minute cool down. Somedays you do 1 mile gradually working up to 2 miles.If you want to supplement your current workout than I would say purchase it. If you are a beginner to exercise this is the DVD for you."
5,Great,"The DVD arrived new, with original packaging intact. This is a very easy to follow program. Literally, you walk the mile in your setting of choice in front of the TV."
4,Great Workout with Limited Time,This is a great workout with limited time committment. For only 16 to 18 minutes you get a good sweat and feel energized to start your day. If you have more time the 35 minute version is wonderful. Good starter to build up endurance.
5,Fun Walk inside cause it's too cold outside!,"I love this video. It is low impact and fun. I prefer to walk outside with my dog, but I live in upstate NY, so that's not always happening (too cold!) So I walk inside with this video and enjoy my warm house! You don't need much room, some of the segments use light weights. I enjoy using the weights because they increase the intensity, but you don't have to use them. You can get a mile in in 15 minutes, or do the whole thing in over an hour, or anything in between, depending on your time/energy. Love it!!"
3,a little boring,"I would not buy it again. I really am not enjoying the tape. It may be just me, I like Chris Powell's tape better,"
4,Good!,A good video for those who don't want to be totally wiped out. Gets your heartrate up and is a great walk!
4,Works for me,This exercise video meets my needs - I can stay inside no matter what the weather and still get a good workout. I'm glad the video allows us to cut out the instructions as it can get annoying after hearing it a dozen times. This works well for me.
5,Do all 4 miles and you will break a sweat.,I got this video after I had been doing the Leslie Sansone walking dvd's for a few years. Doing all 4 miles of this workout is much harder than any LS video I had done b/4. Great work out. I used a 5# weight in place of the medicine ball. Love 2 use when I can't make the gym.
5,Down with walking,Love this and I am so glad I purshase it. Don't have to worry if it is hot or cold outside. I get my walking done.
2,Why did Bob bother?,"Why did Bob even bother to make this video? He looks bored to death, along with everyone else. The only one with a genuine smile is Sunshine. I'm out of shape and it was even boring for me. It's just a poor copy of Leslie Sansone's videos."
1,Really boring!,"Really boring. Would not recommend it.Wanted a change from Leslie Sansone Walk At Home workouts, so bought this.Disappointing. Will not use it.Could work for u if u r severely overweight and literally can't do anythin else except stand up & move yr legs a little. If not, I'd suggest u give this one a miss. I'd recommend Leslie Sansone's vids over this one any day!For more adventurous & motivated individuals, try Billy Blanks Tae Bo or Bob Harper. He is better than Jillian Michaels hands down!!"
1,BORING!!!,"This honestly is a waste of my money. I'm not sure what I was thinking it would be but not much of a workout, at least for me. Maybe for someone just starting out and needing a little something at first. I wish I didn't buy this one, personally"
5,EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT,"GREAT GREAT GREAT GREATGREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT.EVERYTHING WAS GREAT,PERFECT.SHIPPING,PACKAGING .GREAT GREAT GREAT GREATGREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT.THANKS"
1,Game did not work.,The game did not work. I put the cd in and the startup screen would appear. But everytime I pressed the install button it would freeze my computer. Fair warning.
2,YogaSculpt,"I love Karen Voight, but was extremely disappointed with this DVD. It is the EXACT same DVD as Yoga & Sculpting even though they have different release dates, 4 years apart! The cover on the DVD is different but she's wearing the same outfit and does the same routine. They don't tell you that in the advertisement. Because I liked Karen Voight, I ordered another DVD and then ended up with 2 DVDs exactly alike. I was so upset about this that I emailed her company and told them about it. They knew they were the same but don't tell you that in the advertisement. They were nice enough to exchange YogaSculpt for another DVD for me. But it was a pain because I had to send them YogaSculpt and wait for them to send me something else."
5,Excellent yoga workout for any level!,I had this as a VHS so I was already familar with it. Karen explains very well and the pace/level is great for any fitness level IMO. GREAT YOGA WORKOUT!
4,Great Beginners Yoga DVD!,"I really loved being introduced to yoga with this DVD. The poses and stretches are challenging, yet do-able for me, and I feel like I'm getting a workout. The stretches make my back feel great and I can feel my core strengthening. Even after not doing yoga for a while, I loved coming back to this DVD to get started again. The only part I am a little frustrated with is the fact that I have bad wrists, and have to alter the set that uses too much wrists, but as long as I am gentle and dont push myself into them too long it is fine."
4,Great stretch,"I've been doing this workout for years and needed to replace my VHS with a DVD. I'm 43, and there are some days when I just can't do the weights. This workout starts out slow and invigorates you as you go. This video is a great strength and stretch workout."
3,An okay workout,I thought this was an okay yoga workout. I found the Brian Kest Power Yoga tapes to be a more complete satisfying workout. Not much pose variety in this one.
4,Excellent! This is my first and probably last!,"I have seen other videos and my wife has tried several different kinds, but this is the first ""keeper"" that I have seen so far. When I did it the first time I was very challenged to keep up with her, both in strecthing and endurance. After several times I could do it well enough that I kind of resembled what I saw on the tv. Now I am much better. I always feel both relaxed and engerized when I finish. I am a therapist and I recommend this video to my clients who want to work out and be relaxed, but the gym isnt an option."
2,hard on my wrists,"this is a well made product. her instructions are clear. the music is quiet. her form is impeccable (& her _new_ boobs look too perky.)there seems only few poses repeated: downward dogs or other all-four positions are done too many times. i find it very taxing on my (bad) wrists. surely there're other yoga poses that work hamstrings, lower back equally well?i guess i'm just not the right exerciser the video is made for. i gave mine away after trying it once."
5,Quick and Easy Belgian Waffles,"There's really not much that can be said for this small and elegant machine other than it makes great Belgian waffles, provided YOU make great batter.The waffle maker itself is compact, stores easily, almost completely idiot-proof as it has two glowing attentuators on top. One indicates power to the appliance; the green tells you the waffle maker is ready to make waffles or that your waffle is ready.There's a locking mechanism to keep the lid tight while the waffle is baking. The waffle will NOT stick if you used a cooking spray like PAM (butter flavor?) or Mazola ahead of time as recommended by the manufacturer.Sunday mornings are fun again!"
