4,Fabulous!,"A wonderful musical full of emotion and power. Benny and Bjorn truly show their talents in composing music with this piece. Though it is all in Swedish, the music is incredible. It has nothing to do with the ABBA sound. This music relates to Phantom of The Opera and Les Mis. I highly recommend this if you are a music lover."
3,tread carefully,"Although this is a beautifully orchestrated and performed album it's very much a grand, old-fashioned musical. While there's no denying Benny and Bjorn are fine composers, much of the music in ""Kristina"" is dense and slow to the point of being turgid. If you're attracted to this because of ABBA, beware: there's nothing ""pop"" about this at all."
4,This book is good if you like to learn by categories.,"I have owned this book for several years and use it as a classroom teacher. When my students and I want to learn new vocabulary about a subject, like animals, this book is nice because it groups terms into topics. The index in the back also allows you to quickly find a word."
4,A Great Read,"""A Spy Within"" is a terrific story of intrigue based loosely on the facts surrounding the Soviet Union's acquisition of U.S. atomic secrets following World War II. The author does a great job of developing the central characters.I couldn't put the book down and really enjoyed the resolution of the plot. All in all, it was a very entertaining book that I would highly recommend to anyone who likes a good mystery."
4,Never A Dull Moment!,"While the jacket blurb was interesting, I had no idea this would be such a smooth, fast read -- hard to put down! You really get to know Patrice, the main character. She talks a lot and you are with her constantly. The author makes a couple of interesting choices about what Patrice will (or will not) do, and by the end of the book you are more than ready to read another one -- not available yet, sad to say. You don't need to be a Los Alamos history buff to enjoy the plot, but you will learn something along the way despite yourself. Put it on your gift list!"
4,Solid first effort by Ms. Baughman.,"Though the Cold War's over, there's still A SPY WITHIN in the atomic bomb's hometown of Los Alamos, New Mexico. An old man's tales of a Russian spy in the midst of the bomb's creators leads to murder and intrigue, as a newspaperwoman hunts for the truth behind the web of secrecy and lies. Get a cup of hot tea and curl up by the fire with this one. But be prepared to stay up reading long after the embers have died."
4,Intrigue in Los Alamos,Those of us who live in Santa Fe know that there are still many secrets in Los Alamos. This book reveals at least one of them. Lynnette Baughman also reveals the flavors of life as it is lived in New Mexico. It rings true.
5,love it!,"This product is fantastic!! I take it out of the fridge/freezer once a month to refresh and it's good to go. What a great product and you never have to throw anything away. It's compact enough to fit in any size fridge/freezer, especially since it hangs from the sides and doesn't get in the way."
1,Terrible quality.... do not buy,"I have purchased this lamp to replace an older unit. At first it looked OK, with a couple of glass panes loose inside the package. As I finish installing the main body I noticed a crack in the top cover. Amazon promptly sent a replacement (a refurbished unit, filled with newspapers inside the box), but this one was also cracked, in the main body this time. The cast aluminum is really of the worst kind, even if you're lucky to get a good lamp at first, expect it to crack during winter due to thermal contraction and expansion."
1,Damaged goods,I purchased a post top lattern from Amazon.com / Trans Globe Lighting. When I opened the box I found one of the formed glass panels on the top of the lattern broke and upon inspecting the box it came in I came to the conclusion that the product was broke before shipping. The lattern was in a box and put in another box with bubble rap around it for shipping. The shipping box did not show any damage to the out side but the box from the company had damage to one corner. I am trying to get a replacement glass but have not been able to. I sure would like to use this item I bought but can't because it will fill up with rain. I guess I am going to have to ship it back and ask for a refund. This is the problem with buying something over the internet.
4,pretty but.....,"The light is pretty but the color was off , it was supposed to be white but is actually cream colored so it doesn't match the post. Also what looked like finger smudges were actually scrapes on the glass."
4,My Cat Loves It,"My cat loves this thing. It's not necessarily the sturdiest item in the world, but it suits my cat's needs just fine."
1,This is not entertainment,"The story barely made any since at all, Lauren is in a white room but at the same time she is in the real world, her brother is running around an empty town and even sees her on a movie screen and can hear her screams as he walks around town. One hour in we start getting the story a little at a time, no wait I was wrong. We are never filled in on what the heck is going on, no reason behind the girl in the box, the guy running around an empty town, what was killing everyone, why all the bodies were in the woods. Nothing at all made any real since. This movie sucked as much as it could and then took an extra step to suck a little more. Don't waste your time are money on it, it will just piss you off."
1,crap don't buy person/ store watch without buying and see lt,why are stores selling this and stealing my money elvia is showing better movies some movies that are old and newer are being sold for 5.00 if i bought a candy bar on sale for .50 and it was bad i'd return it telling but your selling on line i can't return that easy i'm trusting you and amazon it's pure crap crap crap
3,Lost souls,"The SINISTER SOULS movie pack offers up a half-dozen excellent reasons for sleeping with the lights on for the rest of your life. These ghastly, gruesome and gory ghouls and demented demons will haunt you... maybe FOREVER! (Don't say you weren't warned...)For more bizarre Pendulum Pictures ""fun,""SERIAL PSYCHOSwill keep you screaming all the way to the blood bank!The alphabetized program list below includes 1 to 10 viewer poll ratings, year of release and principal actors for each title.(6.6) Cope (2007) - Rachel Pinto/Robert Allen Wagner/Krystal Sullivan(2.2) The Crucifier (2005) - Rocco Martone/Ryan Miller/Rachel DeGenaro(2.4) Dominion (1992) - Carol Barta/Frank Dunlay/Auggi Alvarez(2.0) I Dream of Dracula (2003) - Michellina Shafranski/Jae Mosc/Maria Bolaris(7.0) Sick Bstrd (UK-2007) - Ken Dirke/Collette Green/Amy Hill/Michael Johnson(2.1) Unborn Sins (2007) - Paul 'P.J.'

2,Dissapointing confusing textile or anthropology?,"This book was expensive I won't keep it for long, Not an easy read, gave me the feeling I was reading someone's doctorate anthropological research, turned into a not very good book,For this price there could have been lot more colored photos; the black and white photos are frankly awful (pesimo) More history into Pre-Colombian use of hair sashes and the ornate headresses seen in Mayan frescoes and statues would have been useful.This book is relatively interesting for some of the textile details, but it is a mix-up.. was I looking more at textile designs... or a book about anthropology and the area of Jacatenango,there are many other places with fine textiles in the Mayan highlands.Think the name of the book sounds interesting, so people will buy it.Sometimes I found it easier to read the Spanish. The english is OK but when there are specific Spanish/Mayan words it is easier to understand in Spanish."
4,Well Done!,This product is well made and exactly what I was expecting. The product arrived in good shape from the retailer and in a timely manner. I recommend the product and the retailer.
5,RETIRED US NAVY VETERAN LICENSE PLATE FRAME,I was not only pleased with the quality of this item (seller was completely honest in their description) but the mailing time was two days less than promised. I would recommend to anyone who is thinking about purchasing this item not to hesitate. They will be pleased they did.
3,License Plate Frame,Too expensive for the average quality of this item.When tightened down the bottom bowed out due to lack of lower mounting holes.
3,Calm and Collected,"Now, while this clone lacks knee articulation, or verticle articulation of the left arm, he is still suitable for play and posing. The posing is somewhat limited by his lack of knees, but he can still be positioned into some cool positions, most of which involve shooting or snipining. For leading troops into battle, he can appear to calmly assault everything, do to his perpetual upright stance. The fact that he comes with two weapons is a plus, as they can be used to replace lost weapons. Also, his shoulder armor can be removed and placed on any other clone (roughly, as the latch cannot snap, but the pad stays on nonethe less) and can result in sick looking specialized troops. Good for mixing and matching."
1,Not true!,"It was unfortunate this was the first singing book I ever read and so I gave up on singing. Pretty much the author say singing is a borned talent and cannot be taught. Not true! Recently, I started taking some singing lessons to find out for myself and I have improved dramatically. You can do anything in life if you have good discipline and alot of perserverence! Don't let anyone tell you that you can't."
5,excellent budget laptop,"This is a great budget laptop and I'm totally happy with it. It came refurbished but everything is like new. There's even a more powerful T2250 processor (1.7 GHz and 2MB L2 cache) included which many chat sites mention as showing up in some of the MT3705s. This laptop is more portable than other 14.1-inch laptops I considered such as Dell 1405 because Gateway managed to fit the 14.1 inch screen in a smaller case without sacrificing features. The specs are impressive with Vista Premium, 1MB RAM, DVD RW and the screen is very bright and sharp. The battery seems to last about 2.5 hours on balanced power management mode. You can't beat this deal for a very competitive laptop!"
3,"Affordable, acceptable laptop for budget price.","With a price of $500 for a refurbished model, this laptop was affordable. I am often ""on the go"" and I like this laptop's portability. It is light and easy to carry. Overall, it performs decently, although it is kind of slow because its memory is only expandable up to 2 GB and it comes loaded with the resource-hogging Vista OS (switching it over to XP would probably make it run faster). The one drawback to this laptop is that the wireless card is unreliable. For some reason, it won't pick up a wireless signal very well even when it is very close to the router, while another laptop user in the same room can get online without a problem. Unfortunately, tech support was patently unhelpful in resolving this problem, so I disabled the on-board wireless card and am using a Rosewill wireless USB adapter. With the adapter, I have no problem getting online."
4,Good read,"This book was a good read. For Nora Roberts fans, it's just one more in the line of must reads."
2,"First story horrible, 2nd one a bit less horrible","Ewww, the first story of Gabriella is really boring. I didn't even finish it. I skipped to the next story of Alexander and it was better. The first story had nothing interesting about it and I found the characters plain and so boring I wanted to cry. At least in the second story about Alexander he was a bit interesting. He's one of those males that has to keep his emotions under wraps and therefore struggles with his love for the heroine. I do like those kind of stories. I wouldn't recommend buying this book. The second story did make up for some of the disappointment of the first but not enough to shell out the money. Check it out at the library like I did."
5,Beautiful....,"my first Nora Roberts novels..Affaire Royale and Command Performance has changed my viewpoint of Romance Novels. I really appreciated Roberts' way of choosing the right words for every little thing, taking the time for readers to appreciate th most important moments in the stories. Personally, the frequent use of words in French shook my heart...I had checked out these books from the public library at first, and I've placed my order on Affaire Royale, Command Performance, Playboy Prince, and Cordina's Crown Jewel.Although I found Playboy Prince to be a little bit less attractive to me, I was satisfied with the thrills as well as the love between the playboy prince and mysterious spy, Lady Hannah.I recommend reading all three. ENJOY!"
4,Hauntingly evocative,"How would you feel if a younger member of your family were to come home... to die? This is the pivotal point of ""In the gloaming."" I especially liked Glen Close's able performance as the mother who tries to understand her dying son and tries to recapture, in those final days, a smidgen of their past. Various degrees of rejection and denial are interspersedly played by the other members of the family but through it all, there is a sense that there is much more to ""living"" than the simple act of existing. Haunting and beautiful."
5,Wow!,What CAN you SAY for a single product that has a cost-rangeof one-cent to $122 !?I just ordered the penny one...got $122 in loose-change?Let's buy it RIGHT NOW!
3,Jelly Belly Dispenser,"I really like the size of this dispenser, but it only gives out two or three beans at a time, and it gets clogged often. Otherwise it looks really good in my office and supplies a good treat when I need it, plus I get to save money by feeding it my change. I'm happy with it, but I would like to get a larger one eventually."
4,CRYSTAL BASKET,I REALLY LOVE MY NEW BASKET. IT LOOKS GREAT AND IT IS MULTI-FUNCTIONAL. THIS IS A WONDERFUL GIFT.
5,THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR WORDS AND WISDOM,"I AM FINDING THAT SOME OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS WORK TO MAKE MY HOUSE A REAL HOME. WHILE I ALWAYS NEW SOME OF THIS THAT IS WRITTEN , I WAS NEVER ABLE TO CARRY IT INTO PRACTICE UNTIL NOW . THANKS AGAIN. P.S. IF THIS IS WHAT FARRAKHAN TEACHES THEM MAYBE HE IS NOT ALL BAD AFTERALL."
1,Worst garbage bag I've ever tried,"An earlier reviewer said that they were perfect for his Simple Human trash can. It may be true that these are good for an odd shape or size of can. But for a normal kitchen-size trash can, they are awful. Bad idea in the execution. Essentially, you have to rip the sides of the bag for it to fit on the can. It's all good while it's in place -- but once you go to remove it, you see that no matter how you tight you pull the drawstrings, the top will be a little open on both sides. This might be fine for some uses (like maybe in an office), but for any trash that smells, its a total loser. I bought these for our diaper trash can; I think I'll throw the remainder into the next normal Hefty trash bag I buy."
5,The Best Kitchen Trash Bags,We have tried out a lot of different trash bags and had many many bag failures. The Hefty Gripper is by far the best bag we have used. It does not slip down into the trash can so that you have to fish it out around your trash and they are very strong so we have not had problems with punctures or bags breaking on the way to the big trash can. Also the odor neutralizing feature on this bag help keep our kitchen from smelling like trash even when I cook seafood or other meats. My son (he is 11) is now on trash duty and the couple times we have accidentally purchased he wrong bags he has had problems and messes to clean up. Also the boxes we have gotten do include a Box Top for Education which is an added bonus.
2,Handles tear,"I have used about 10 of these bags so far and on four of the bags, the handles ripped when I was pulling them to tie the bag shut."
3,Good and snug,"It fits just the way I needed on our 13gal Simple Human can, never slips into the can. The only improvement would be if they reinforced the top edge where the strings are as they tend to cut through a bit when tying off to take them out. No busts, or messes though so what more can you ask for?"
2,Weak bags,"I would not buy these again. They are poor-quality and often tear near the handles, which I didn't expect from this brand."
3,Thier 14th album flopped; could we do better?,"Aside from the first 3 songs, many people feel that ELECTRIC UNIVERSE is the only explanation anyone needed for the band taking a 3 year hiatus. A solid decade of setting the bar for R&B songwriting and groundbreaking album production, had no one sounding as good as EW&F did in the 70s. Get out your headphones and check them against anyone; Commodores, Gap Band, Prince...the horns, the vocals & rhythm section were recorded so tight they were years ahead of the competition! After 13 albums of reaching higher and higher Earth, Wind & Fire ran out of inspiration and bottomed out; could we do any better?"
2,The Elements' worst to date.,"Being the big Earth Wind & Fire fan that I am, I have to say that this one was their worst! The Elements, in their attempts to keep up with the times, went the techno-funk route on this one and came up way short. The songwriting and the musicianship were way below standard (a third grader could have written ""Moonwalk"") and whose idea was it to ditch the heralded horn section? It wasn't a total disaster though. Phillip Bailey's vocals hold true, especially on ""Living In Our Own Time"" and the single ""Touch"" is actually kind of catchy. Thankfully The Elements would regain their touch on subsequent albums but this was definitely their lowest point."
5,Fiending for more,"This book was really an intense emotional roller coaster ride. There was romance and lots of plot, plot, plot. This series just keeps getting better and there were a few unexpected plot twists that will keep you on your toes. I just wonder if the series will run out of character names. This is a terrific read and I'm already fiending for the next book in this series."
5,I can't imagine this series getting better than this.,"I just loved Z and Bella's story. I can see why it's a favorite among many! After reading the end of Lover Eternal, I was really looking forward to see how Z could redeem himself. He does. I loved how they came together, and the little things between them that meant so much more. Z took care of Bella, but also made some pretty crappy decisions, but it all worked out in the end. In fact that was probably my favorite part was what Z wrote to Bella in the end. As for the BDB series, some major things come out in this book, someone dies, the identity of The Reverend is revealed and I was shocked. Must read all BDB books before April...I do have some minor gripes with Ward's writing. I don't like how she flips back and forth between scenes, although I'm getting used to it. The writing from the lessers point of view is a little annoying and I usually skim over it. Other than that, I really love this series."
4,amazing dialogue and main characters,"More of a 4.5 Amazing dialogue, and the tension between Belle and Zsadist was amazing up to the point where they did the deed, then their story kind of took a backseat. The dialogue among the brothers was also amazing and superfun. I couldn't put the book down.I was a bit hesitant about this book since I don't like it where the H/H are victims, but the author did a great job with the flashbacks on when the Hero was a bloodslave. A very good job. You end up understanding the characters, but not feel sorry for them.I liked this book better than the 1st book of the series."
4,Zadist it the Darkest of the Brotherhood,"Loved the book. Well thought out plot. It was really set up well in the 2nd book with Belle. Now I can't wait to find out what happens to John and to find out if the other warrior comes back. If you like vampires, thrillers, mysteries, and romance all tied up in one book, then this is the series for you!"
2,A disappointment,"I read both other books a couple of months ago, and was hooked. I loved the brotherhood, and Zsadist was my favorite character in them all. I eagerly awaited his book, and seeing all the good reviews made me run and buy it.I felt so cheated when I read the book. I just didn't feel he was very well developed, his story sounded haphazardly at best. But Bella was the greatest disappointment of all. She was so awesome in the other books, but in this one I hardly recognized her.Oh the action was good, and it was nice 'n dark, but it just didn't do it for me."
1,Wow. Just wow.,"I don't usually bothering writing reviews on books, but after seeing that the book had 5 stars I had to.This book is truly god awful, to put it bluntly. There's too much plot, too much back story, and too many characters competing for space. There's absolutely no real characterization. And of course, it's so cheesy it's laughable. Zadist's (if you can call that a name) history of sexual abuse is just a stupid ploy to gain sympathy from the readers, and as soon as the insipid, forgettable heroine appears he's able to magically heal. The so called ""romance"" was the best example of IKEA porn I've seen outside a LKH novel. The dialogue honestly made me feel embarrassed for the writer, and the idea of leather-clad, wanna-be thug vampires was just too pathetic to believe.So, if you're into that kind of stuff, this is the book for you. As for me, let's just say this is my new guide on how not to write."
3,I'm just not feeling the love,"I don't like how the author pussies these big strong men turning them into fluff. I felt a lot of this book was just filler, with loose ends tied up in a stock standard way. There is nothing exceptional about this series."
4,Lover Awakened,"Bella has been kidnapped and her family believes her to be dead but Zsadist is still looking for her. When a civilian vampire reports that Bella is alive, Zsadist wants to rush to her rescue even though it's daylight out. Zsadist is impatient to get moving but the whole Brotherhood takes part in her rescue. John Matthew starts his training as a warrior and feels like a failure at it. John Matthew feels an attraction to Sarelle, who is helping Wellsie with the Winter Solstice Festival. Phury is attracted to Bella but so is Zsadist, who won't admit it to himself. Zsadist keeps pushing Bella to his twin, Phury but Bella only has eyes for Zsadist. Can Bella help heal Zsadist? Will Zsadist allow Bella into his life? What will Phury do about his attraction to Bella? Can John endure warrior training? These questions and many more are answered in Lover Awakened."
4,A rollercoaster of emotions!,"I have to start out by saying that I was not very happy about what happened to Welsie, that is why I gave the book only 4 stars instead of 5, & I'll admit that out of the three books so far, this was the darkest one yet. But on a more positive note, I loved Zsadist from the first two books & was very happy to see him finally get the peacefulness & ""happy ending"" that his character so deserved. I just wish that there had been a little bit more of him & Bella in the book! I do, though, like the way JR Ward always has several mini storylines running consecutively throughout all of her books, which not only gives you a better understanding of the Brotherhood & of the Brothers, but also helps make the transition from one book/storyline to another that much easier. All in all, I enjoyed the book and can't wait for Butch's story to be told!"
4,Commandment Breaker,"I would very much enjoy this series if not for the fact that I'm cringing at least every other page because the author cannot keep herself from frequently taking the Lord's name in vain; breaking one of the Ten Commandments. I don't know how she is not afraid to thumb her nose at God, but it really bothers me. I read this book and another with pen in hand, obliterating the offensive words, but don't know that I will be reading any of her others...a shame, because overall I really like the story line."
5,WOW!,I read this book first thinking it was the first in the series. WOW! It took my breath away. It is one of the best love stories I have ever read! I could not put it down once I started. I sure would like to read more about the two lovers!
5,Hottest Vampire Series EVER!!!,"This is the 3rd book in the series. Read them in order. These books are sooooo hot. JR Ward writes the most passionate sexy novels. Go to her web site she interviews all the vampires. The love scenes are so sexy you'll want to read them over again. Right amount of romance, passion and action. Love this book especially. Read the whole series, starting with Dark Lover it's red. The second book is blue and the fourth is orange. LOVE Love Love it!!!!!"
5,Really good read,"We see a vulnerable side to Zsadist in this book, where he is unable to control his feelings for Bella however hard he tries. Bella is the key to his peace of mind whether he cares to admit it or not. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and how J.R. Ward intertwines other characters in this book drawing the reader in, bringing out curosity as to who these other characters are and where their stories will lead to. Well done J.R. Ward."
2,Too depressing,"Oh my God I really struggled with this. Zsadist is a MISERY. Do not read this if you are looking for a light and uplifting and fun story, this is dark and heavy and very slow going."
4,love it,"loved this book series so so so much, found it very hard to put down . I would recommend to everyone."
4,The most emotional book in the series so far!,"Vampires have long been symbols of power and sexuality, and the author of this series definitely takes this theme seriously! This is an interesting take on vampires and those who hunt them. The characters are interesting, compelling, and surprisingly believable. Themes of family, brotherly love, romantic love, honor, and loyalty really suck you in. The pop culture references (slang and music references) date the book, but it's still plenty entertaining. The sex scenes are really great! A lot of women (including myself) love a seriously physical, sexually aggressive guy.... and these male vampire characters are just that. Very hot. Love the whole series! I ordered and read them all within a two week period."
5,I am in love with all of these warriors!!!,I loved this book. Bella and Z were wonderful. I have read all three of the books so far. I am starting the 4th book. I loved the way this book read. It wasn't like he wanted her to stay with her in the book. He just felt like he was not worth it. Bella loved him no matter how much he pressed her away. This is one of the best books I have read. Loved it...
3,What Happened to U? And how did O return from the Omega?,"Warning, slight spoiler to follow - Page 320 has O suffocating & passing out - page 336 U has turned O into the Omega for discipline and is relishing his promotion to fore-lessor, O is no more. Page 343, O is back in the game searching for his ""wife"" and the subject of U does not come up again in this book. Did I miss something? I do tend to skip paragraphs in these books, but I did go back and look...in vain. All of you 5 star raters - what happened? Zsadist is my favorite warrior, so I was happy to see him find some peace and love."
4,enjoyable read,This is the third book I have read can't wait to read the next book in the series once I get started they are hard to put down until done.
5,EXCELLENT,"I knew Zadist's story was going to be hard. How do you make a man with so many wounds, mental & physical grow and heal. And somehow J.R Ward has done that. And Bella is perfect for him.I also liked the fact that other things are also going on with the other characters. That it's not just dialog between Zadist & Bella. Everything that happens apart from our two main characters is what brings everything full circle in this story.I was not disappointed and I cannot wait for the next book."
3,Okay supernatural series,Okay but not the best series. Worth a read though if you eat books like I do and like the supernatural genre.
5,Love this story,"So far this is my favorite story of the series. So much happened. Bella dealing with the after effects of being held captive but still wanting Zsadist. Zsadist and his feeling not being worthy of Bella's love because of him being a blood slave. The crazy Mr.O wanting his ""wife"" back at all cost.Poor John. Having to deal with the other boys being jealous. Then having to deal with what happens to Wellsie and Sarelle. Also with Tohr's disappearance.The only bad thing I have to say is mainly with the authors use of constant slang. (you can say shoes instead of shitkickers)"
5,One of the best out of the series!!,"Words cant describe the way I feel about this story. It swallowed me whole from page one, I finished it in two days. It was the my favorite..."
4,Zsadist and Bella,"This is the book that I thought started to show some interconnectivity to the characters. This book is dark; it shows gives a lot of the back story of Zsadist's life as a blood slave. His past haunts him throughout the book and it so amazing to see how his fondness for Bella starts to shatter some of his walls. Ward does a great job in this book, she makes you see that the front of, I am an evil bxxxxxd, is not all that Zsadist can be."
5,the best of them all!,"The best book by far (I just read the last one Lover Avenged) and still, book #3 is the best!"
3,3.5 stars,"After reading so many promising reviews I expected a real page turner but was slightly disappointed. The heroine was likable yet uninteresting.But it was still an enjoyable read. Enjoyable, but not great."
3,One of the few,"I liked the H and h in this book. The author told Z's story very well. My issues w/ this book were that, although I felt the H/h had a connection, it was not as deep as I had thought it would be based upon the reviews. It seemed more surface vs. totally engrossing. Don't get me wrong, this is a page turner, but, I guess I am used to a more deep read, this is a dark read. I did hate the terms ""s-kicker"" used for shoes and some of the slang used over and over was very distracting. I also, as another reader stated, found myself skipping over parts of the book, and some of the side stories that I felt were an interference. I do understand it was laying a foundation for more novels. I just wanted to read about Z and Bella and the ""sides"" were annoying.I bought this on Kindle, and I should have reserved at the local library."
5,My Favorite Paranormal Romance Novel Ever,"I LOOOOOVE Zsadist, so Lover Awakened is my favorite. I love a good love story where the guy is a bad boy who is not obviously handsome and is very flawed; falls in love with the girl who thinks he's beautiful and she is able to break through that shell. I thought this was the most romantic, heart wrenching and beautiful story so far. While it was difficult to read the pain and suffering of his past, it was necessary to really see him and understand why he was so hardcore. I thought Ward did a fabulous job with this character."
5,Keeps getting better and better,"Usually by the third or fourth book some authors start losing steam, but not JR Ward. Lover Awakened is her best book yet. I won't go into the synopsis since others have done it far better than I could. I will recommend that those of you who are new to the series go back and read from the beginning. You won't regret it and it will help fill in some of the blanks. I admire the fact that Ms Ward doesn't fall into the trap of explaining old characters over and over again and just gets on with the story.And what a story it is! Of all the males in the Brotherhood, I felt Zsadist's story would be the hardest to tell. And in a way it was, but Ms Ward knows her stuff. I got so caught up in the book that I couldn't stop reading and now I have to wait until March of 2007 for the next one!On this one you can believe the five star hype. It is that good."
5,Excellent,"This book was outright amazing. Twist and turns... it is a must read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys supernatural,suspense,romance novels."
4,reread,62. [Lover Awakend] by J.R. Ward 434 pages 4 starsLover Awakend has Bella still missing while the brotherhood still searchs for her. Phury and Zsadist are both fighting for her love once they get her back. Tohr and his family have a real tough time in this book. I just didn't want to put the book down.
5,Reading with Tequila,"Why read: Loved the series so far.What impressed me: I love Zsadist. His complete rawness makes him a powerful character. Bella manages to be convincing as both a strongly sexual woman and a caring, nurturing influence. Their romance is unconventional and sometimes extremely painful to read, but their need for one another both physically and emotionally makes for a hell of a love story.What disappointed me: The Lessening Society irks me more and more with each book. Their methods seem largely ineffective. Instead of feeling like a scary foe the Brotherhood needs to be wary of, they seem like annoying little bugs that are mostly just aggravating.Recommended: Absolutely.Continue series: Most definitely."
4,Loved it!,"I love this series! I am actually reading them all very again since I got a Kindle for Christmas. This book is probably my favorite. Zsadist was always interesting to me! I only have one negative about it, I felt there were too many stories going on.Also for all the negatives on the word s*%$kickers, this is an actual brand, not just slang! my husband owns a pair for work (no, he just works in a factory and wanted some quality steel toed boots that would last)!"
5,JR Ward's best yet in the series,"I've been waiting for Z's story since the first book so naturally this book was highly anticipated by me. How happy I was to find that this book met every expectation I had.I must admit that I normally avoided interconnecting/series books like a plague because I found the writing quality to always decline as the series progressed. But JR Ward proved me wrong. The 3rd book is even better than her previous books. Z was undoubtably the most compelling character in the series (at least to me) and I was equally satisfied with Bella, whom I think was a big improvement over the heroine from the second book. JR Ward created a heroine who knew what she wanted and wasn't afraid to show and go for it. At the same time she understood when to back off and when to push.I also loved the flashbacks that showed the unique relationship between Z and his twin, how they loved each other and would die for each other.Put me in as one of many fans of this series. The Warden rocks!"
3,Somebody please kill off the Lesser's,"I have to say again I keep persevering with this series waiting for the greatness that everyone raves about.Don't get me wrong, there are elements of this series that I really enjoy, but the lesser's...OMG the lesser's are killing it for me. And I know you can skim those parts but that's nearly half the book so it kinda ruins it for me. I really don't need their POV....at all.....like ever!I did thoroughly enjoy Z & Bella's story & I also enjoyed the insight into Z & Phury's relationship & how it improved throughout this book. & that's what get's the 3 stars for me. The Lesser's swallow up the other 2.I'm conflicted as to whether to continue or not. I mean Butch & Marissa are next...really Butch...I don't know.Maybe I'll take a break & come back to it another time...maybe not :("
5,My Favorite One,"I've read all of them up until Lover Mine (because it's not on Kindle. Grrr). This is a HOT story and sad at the same time. I've actually had to look back and compare all the other relationships and story lines, and this one is by far the best. I finish these books fast because I want to know what happens next, but I hated for this one to end. It is a MUST read. And then read again, and again, and again..."
5,Awakened,"I must admit that this series awakened the vampire reader in me, never having really been a fan of the genre previously. J.R. Ward does a fantastic job in layering and interweaving multiple plots and stories; however, I believe this is the best work in the series. She pushes the depth and dimensions of her character development with Zadist and Bella above and beyond; it is definitely worth a repeat reading. I appreciate the fact that she returns to Zadist's story in Father Mine, but wish that it had been included as part of Lover Awakened."
1,cheaply and poorly made,This breadbox is poorly made. It was warped and did not close properly. Would NOT recommend a purchase of this item. I returned it.
4,Serves its purpose!,"This box is great looking, a little bigger than I expected, but it keeps my breads out of sight, which is all I wanted. Don't know if it really keeps bread more fresh, but it definitely serves its purpose for me! LOVE the fall-front door so I can stack things on top if need be."
1,unsatisfactory,"BreadboxBrabantia Fall Front Bread Box, Brilliant Steelarrived damaged, (dent), front door squeaked on closing. poor Quality Control. I returned it and didn't want a replacement."
5,We love it,This bread box does what we needed to do. We wanted to preserve room under the cabinet and this also provided is a place to put condiments on top of the bread box.
3,Disappointed in the quality,"For $50, I expected at least a medium-quality breadbox. Not so. The metal is very lightweight and almost flimsy. The cardboard box it comes in JUST fits around the box--no styrofoam or packing of any kind, thus the one I ordered had some damage to the plastic trim around the edges, including damage at one of the ""joints"" where the bread box opens. The metal is very susceptible to being dented. If you have kids and expect this to get heavy use, I would steer clear. I ordered mine (with one ding in it already) from e-bay at a lower price, and I'm glad I did--would DEFINITELY not be worth $50."
3,"looks good, works, doesn't ""seal""","This product is ok. The advertising says it ""magnetically seals"" but there is just one small magnet in the center that keeps the door closed, not really ""sealed""Summary: looks good and works"
3,its ok,"It's not as big as what it stated. Doesn't hold 2 large loaves of bread, not really worth what I paid"
3,Good but damaged,Breadbox is the best I have found anywhere. However it came with a huge dent on the back. I tried to exchange but they were out of stock. This was a Christmas gift so this was disappointing.
1,disappointe,"Package came without any packing material between bread box and carton, and sure enough did come dented. The bread box was made of VERY thin metal maybe even 26 gauge. It was very cheap, flimsy and would dent easily. I would not have it on my counter because of the looks of it new and wanted with getting stainless something that would last a long time. It was obvious that this product would not come close to what I wanted. Amazon was great and offered a return immediately."
3,Would Look Good - Packaging stinks!,"I ordered this bread box even after reading the reviews about all the dents, etc. My order arrived on time but I couldn't believe how it was shipped! It was packaged in the full color thin box you might see it in on a store shelf and that was wrapped in BUBBLE WRAP with packaging tape and the shipping label attached to the bubble wrap. Bubble Wrap on the outside! Never have I seen anything shipped like this. I am so disappointed in Amazon in this case. The corner of the carton and bread box were crushed - looked like it was dropped on that corner possibly. Will be returning it but not sure if I'll order another. This is definitely not ""Frustration Free Packaging"".I gave this item 4 stars because I liked the box but it was a bit more flimsy than I thought it should be. I didn't reduce it because of the shipping problems because that's not the products fault."
1,Banged up upon arrival,"This item arrived while I was travelling, due to some address changing issues. I was too late to return it, unfortunately:(It had arrived dented and looking used.I do otherwise like the brand, but this particular item is too thin for transportation."
4,Really Like the new breadboxes,"This product looks nice and is very practical. Keeps breads, chips, etc.. freash. It also matches our appliances. We bought two and have them stacked under one of our kitchen cabinets. I used a few pieces of velcro to prevent sliding. A tad lighter weight than I expected but apparently very well made. Despite some previous concerns about packaging, these items were well packed and arrived in great condition."
1,Wrong Breadbox,"The item that I received and paid for was not ""Brabantia"" brand. It was Home Basics that I could get a most houseware stores for $15. It was not packaged just came in its origianl box. The items was bent in several places, therefore I just sent it right back."
4,Lots of storage space,"I am very happy with this product. It holds two loaves of bread and has room for additional items. It was not as heavy weight as I expected, but, does the job. It helps keep my counter top organized and I can use the top for additional storage if needed."
2,Flimsy,"For this price, you would expect much sturdier construction. It slightly wobbles when you open it and I can't see this lasting too long. On the positive side it looks fine and has ample storage space."
1,Disappointing,Flimsy metal bends and dents if you look at it wrong. Impossiable to mount under counter unless you are a contortionist ( no room for screwdriver to obtain torque to put screws in straight.) A very poor quality item for the price. Repletion of the quality made by the supplier. Oh it is made in China need we say more.
1,No Shipping protection at all... delicate item fully damaged!,"I found this delicate Kitchen item to be exactly what I was looking for. Technically, it was my second choice as the first one (also by Barbantia) was damaged even BEFORE Amazon placed in their shipping box. Barbantia goes to no effort at all to protect these very delicate items in their original manufacturer's packaging. This SECOND order was shipped by Amazon with NO SHIPPING BOX AT ALL and was fully destroyed AFTER I paid 50% more to replace the first damaged item before Christmas. TERRIBLE original packaging and TERRIBLE fulfillment effort! These items should never be sold via delivery service and should remain ""In Store only!"""
5,Wonderful breadbox!,"This is a very stylish breadbox. I like the plain sleekness of it. It's easy to clean. I particularly wanted a breadbox that had a drop down door. It's very roomy and will hold 2 loaves of bread or 1 loaf and bagels,donuts,muffins or cookies. I would recommend this to anyone."
1,Disappointed in quality,"Disappointed. The product metal is too lightweight, flimsy and easily dented. Too dented to work correctly. Box was too thin. Packaging was too thin. For the price, not quality. Arrived dented.Also disappointed in Amazon now too, for not accepting my first honest opinion. Not worth the trouble!"
4,Bread bin,The bread bin great although when it arrived their was a couple of small dents on the back but no big deal because it going up against the wall and you can't see them other then that great bin.
5,Love it!,"Love this breadbox. Haven't used one for years, but this one doesn't use any counter space because of it's flat top. I can place other items on top of it. It also gives more room inside from the 'box' design instead of the usual curved door. The 'no fingerprints' is a great plus."
3,Totally overpriced!,"The product did not arrive dented or damaged as other reviewers have mentioned. Actually, it was shipped within three boxes. However, the construction is flimsy and the door does not seal tight. It stays closed, but the edges are not even with the side of the box. It is completely overpriced!"
2,Arrived damaged,"Item was appropriately boxed, but still arrived with a dent on top that could not be pressed out. Will have to return item."
2,Arrived Dented,"Came in a thin cardboard box packed in a slightly larger cardboard box with a few pieces of crumpled packing paper. The larger box was dented and dinged. The smaller box was dented right where the bread box was dented. Go figure. It is very thin metal. I could practically bend out the ding with my hand - but not completely, so back to Amazon it goes. Do you really have to pay 100 bucks to get a decent gauge of metal in a bread box??!"
3,its a breadbox !,I received the Item quickly and was ok with the price. Looks great but there is a small dent in the stainless steel door. Not worth the headache to return.
2,Adorable but not practical,"The clothes were adorable but definately not a practical one. The chore falls on the parent when the child cannot get the clothes on the doll. Once on they fit, but getting them there is a battle."
2,not worth it,This plane didn't come w/ the necessary parts to actually fly it. You spend this kind of money and then find out u have to buy even more stuff just to get it in the air. Don't waste your money unless you have these extra expensive parts sitting at home!!!
2,Sounds flat,"Very easy to setup with a RAZR V3. The sound volume was loud enough when at max. The callers complained of wind noise and it sounds flat. Voice dailing through the headset worked almost as well as the handset.I would not buy this handset because of the ""flatness"""
2,too hard,This book is for players who are interested in learning to sight read and learning about music theory. It is not user friendly to those who are not very familiar with music terminology. It does not explian things in a way that is easy for a newcommer to understand. I have been playing guitar (but not reading music) for over 15 years. I bought this book because I wanted to learn to read music and learn about improvising. I will have to use another book that is on a lower level and maybe move on to this one later.

3,Sunforest lives!,"As you have already read or heard, Circulus plays a modern ""revisionist"" take on the hippy acid-folk scene of the late 60's/early 70's.While I commend them for not jumping on this months musical fad, I must say for my money they just dont measure up to their fore-fathers.One in particular, Sunforest, from which Circulus have obviously taken their entire schtick - the ""English-acid-folk-meets-medieval hippy rock"".They even borrow from Sunflower's sole releases album art,depicting them all decked out in the height of medieval fashion! This is not nearly as catchy, or strong of a release."
3,Started out good but they missed the opportunity to be no.1 show of the decade.,"the show started really well, no doubt the best opening ever. the characters were fully developed, by the time you finish all six seasons you will feel like you be living with them on the island. you will feel what they have gone thru or will go thru throughout the end. As i said before the characters were fully developed, you will see their past, present and the future. you will see the hard work they put into the show. Enough about positive talk. I didnt like the take on S6. By season 6 there were many loop holes in the series, and the writer forgot about what the series has been all about. there were many new characters in season 6; they were not properly introduced, plus i was hoping for better ending. Overall the show is blast i will rate this show 3.6 out of 5"
5,Prepare to be addicted,"If you were one of those people who were instantly hooked on the early seasons of Alias or 24, you will find that your compulsion to those shows will pale in comparison. One episode is all it takes to suck you in.This isn't a TV series. It is visual crack."
5,The second time around is BEST!,I saw things I didn't notice and didn't remember when watching the network 1st season. It's so cool to be able to watch it again and see everything. Film quality is GREAT! Couldn't have been a better Birthday present!
5,Best Show On Television Right Now,"This is a great show. Enough has been said about the plot twists, etc. so I will not go further than to say that if you like the edge of the original Twilight Zone you will find this much more satisfying than the inconsistency of The X-Files. Before this I was hooked on 6 Ft. Under. This is much, much better."
4,Be Careful About DVD Packaging,"I love Lost and didn't want to hurt it's rating in any way by giving it too few stars, but be aware that the DVD packaging, at least for me and a couple of people I have talked with, does not work! The disk 1 and disk 6 DVD DO NOT snap into place. When I opened the packaging disks started falling out (not exactly what I was expecting). I thought that maybe mine was just broken, but there are no plastic pieces floating around in the box. The disks just simply do not stick well. Check for that when you buy!"
3,pretty boring,I stopped watching the show after the first disc. nothing in the show even happens. dont waste your money on it
3,Downgrading your viewing experience?,"Seems kinda pointless to buy this on DVD when ABC broadcasts it in HD. Besides, this show ran out of steam big time near the end of the season. Way too many questions unanswered and in general the feel of the show became much too unbelievable.The real highlight of this show is the eye candy, which will not translate well from 720p high defintion to 480p DVD.If you're not watching Lost in HD, you are missing out. Do a google for ""ATSC"" or ""DTV"" and get yourself set up for the ultimate viewing experience of this show."
3,It's Jumped the Shark,I used to really like this show. The pilot was amazing. But the second the French woman showed up it lost the creepy-cool quality I loved. It annoys me how the show seems to go absolutly no where fast. If an urgant problem is brought up in an episode its a good bet that you won't hear anything signifigant about it for at least 4 more episodes. As soon as it stopped being creepy it was all over.
2,Faulty Discs,"I had to return the first copy sent to me because the discs wouldn't work in my DVD player and the writing on the discs looked smeared. Finally, I was sent a working copy that looked much more professional and less bootlegged."
5,Found...Great Entertainment w/ LOST,"LOST is Captivating, exciting, action packed. . .great characters, great writing. Can't stop watching!!!"
5,Great DVD set with a great season,LOST season 1 is a definite must buy for any lost or non-lost fan. Right from the very beginning it sucks you never lets go. It has tons of extras and bonus features on the box set. I highly recommend this set for anyone.
4,thanks for the multi-ethnic cast,"At last, a show with characters where their ethnic identity affects their story, but it avoids the usual stereotypes. I'm grateful that a popular show has found a large following and people can love or hate the characters based on their personalities. The Asians are not regulated into science geeks and Jin and Sun have become sex symbols."
5,I wasn't expecting to like this show so much,I had tried watching this show a couple times on television and could never get into it (being somewhat confused about what was going on). So when my sister got the first season for me as a gift i wasn't sure how well i would like it. I quickly found that watching the show from the beginning cleared up all my confusion and i was automatically hooked. I watched the entire first season in a week and promptly borrowed the next 2 seasons from my sister and even got a co-worker hooked. Trust me that Lost is like no other show you have ever watched and dvd is the best way to watch it.
1,Starts out great - goes absolutely nowhere.,"At the beginning of the first season the writers had about enough plot for six episodes - then they made 24 episodes out of it.While the general idea of the show is great, the first season has turned out to be as exciting as watching paint dry.If you loved the later seasons of The X-Files or Alias, where they kept dancing around the same ""secrets"" without ever giving any answers, then Lost is the show for you.If you want to watch a show that actually goes somewhere and whose writers have an idea about where they are taking the story, then stay as far away from Lost as possible."
1,Unintelligent,"Watched the first pilot episode downloaded from iTunes for $2, based on the rave reviews. All I can say that it is very slow and boring. Invisible monsters running around a tropical island terrorizing survivors, gimme a break!!! Maybe I just don't get it but I didn't think it was worth the time and money to continue watching. I enjoyed 24 and Entourage, but this show really puts me to sleep. Disclaimer: I'm not a great fan of JJ Abrams, he is the most overrated director ever."
1,OOooh! Can't wait!!!!!,"This first season is great! I can't wait to buy this and re-live the finale where you learn absolutely nothing about what's going on and they introduce more characters and more puzzles! And I can't wait for season 2 where we may, perhaps, learn how Kate does her hair so well every episode and maybe why the boat scene in the end looked like it was filmed in my backyard pool, because LORD KNOWS they will never reveal anything until they're set for cancellation!!!!!!am done with this show. too many questions...not enough answers...I wonder if even the writers/producers know where the heck they're going with this...My time is too precious to waste and so is yours!!!!"
1,Dumb,"Terrible - I found this series to be unrealistic and melodramatic. When have you ever seen such a uniformly good looking bunch of plane passengers? Obviously, this particular flight had taken off from LAX and was a bunch of actors on their way to some tropical casting call. Why can't Hollywood get it right?"
1,WHERE IS THE 0 STAR OPTION DARN IT!,"The fact that this and Desperate Housewives have become major hits shows that American's tastes have gone downhill. People become stranded on an island and have to learn how to survive. Oh, and by the way, some mysterious things happen. So what? Justhow manuy times has this storyline been used? Too much. All J.J.ABRAMS did to create this series was: Take Gilligan's Island, replace the charachters with smart people (as well as people who are buff and handsome or sexy), use a plane crash to get them stranded on the island, and then use a few storylines that make it seem new and interesting, even though it isn't. This is an action packed soap opera. With a little luck, people will get tired of having to wait months and years to find out the answers to these mysteries."
1,Unsatisfied,"The first package I ordered never came, so it was sent to me again. The second package did not work on my system so I returned it, having to pay 7 for postage myself. I am still waiting for a refund for the returned package."
5,Greatest show ever!,"I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Now I am on season six, and loving every episode. The character development over six seasons is amazing. My wife and two kids love the series as well. It is great to watch on Amazon Prime - you can really get involved with so much content in a small timeframe. I will finish six seasons in about a year.Some people may have issues with the Science Fiction / Fantasy plot-lines. Be patient and you will be rewarded with brilliant, thought-provoking writing."
5,Lost,"I didn't start with the first season and needed the background to keep up. Watching the series on DVD is so convenient! I plan to buy all the seasons. This is such a riveting story, I'm sure it will be replayed for years."
1,Overrated,"Am I alone in thinking that this series is completly overrated? I get the feeling that a lot people simply can't face up to the fact that they hate this show. The characters and story lines are cliched and predictable, and the acting is appaling.Anyone who dislikes this show but then publicly proclaims their love for it is abusing the freedoms that our forefathers lost their lives to defend. You are un-patriotic and not a true American."
1,Beware - spoilers below,"Yes, it is an incredible good debut season. Great acting, amazing stories, mysteries, a great concept. It grabs you by the throat and never let it go. But I'm gonna talk about Season Two.This show ended for me the moment the characters begun to make totally absurd, egotistical, no-sense decisions going against what we have learned about them in the first season. The pinneacle of these absurds ocurred at the moment that Michael killed Ana Lucia. Michael, a character we learned to admire due to his love for his missing son. My jaw simply dropped in astonishment... it was absurd, useless, it broke plot coerence, it was a twist just for the sake of twisting, nothing more. From this moment on I simply do not care anymore about this show. Good luck for all of you who wil kkep watching it."
2,just another tv show,It's nothing special about this show. The acting is lame and the episodes are boring almost like Friends. Stay away from it.
3,Loved the first season!,"I loved the first season and I think I liked the second one too. Who knows.. I watched it so long ago on Netflix I'm gonna have to go back and watch them again. I know I found myself fast forwarding through a lot of the other seasons and I didn't really care for the last season at all. I do not think this is the greatest show ever like some people say but I'm glad people found something they love. We each love our own shows. I watch way better shows than this one.. that being said it was a great idea and may just get the first season not any of the others since I can get the blu rays free on Disney with my rewards. And Hurley rocks!!! I love him. He's the best character on the show! Hated all the flashbacks and going back and forth. I fell out over the same reasons with Heroes on Netflix. Couldn't wait to get it finished. I hate when things start out so good and then they just go into weird back and forth junk. Oh well, I still loved all the characters in the shows."
5,"Great product, fast delivery!",The DVD was delivered within two days of ordering and it arrived in perfect condition. I'm very satisfied and will order again.
4,Espectacularrr!!!!,"Was espectacularrr!!!!, great value but the shipping wasn't so fast. Arrived after the estimated date."
5,Love this series!,"This is the main topic at the water cooler on Thursday AM. The writers have twisted, beautiful imaginations!"
5,Excellent Program,This is one of ABC's new prime time gems. The DVD is well formatted and organized very fluidly. Episodes and extras and are well balanced with eachother.
5,amazing show!!!,"I'll watch anything JJ Abrams creates and he outdid himself with the series Lost. I love this show!! Great cast, great storyline, it never disappoints!"
4,lostfirst season,"This is an excellent dvd set, and a very good series with lots of interesting extras in the last disc relating to this program. Much better watching this DVD than via TV with all the commercial breaks& having to wait for next weeks instalment. Nearly purchased the UK version with only half the content (12 episodes)thankfuly I saw a review on the UK Amazon site which advised to buy the region 1 version. Nicely packaged with an episode guide, the disc mounting arrangement is a bit strange though with one behind the other. Highly recommended."
5,Good gift for LOST fans,"My Christmas gift recipient liked this. It was on the list of requested gift items. I aim to please, as always........."
5,"Superbly written, not to be missed.","A lot can be written about the TV series Lost.I personally think that there is a Lost for everybody,and viewers take what they need from the show. Intricately written, wonderful cinematography , all the clues and twists meshing together like a gigantic 500 piece puzzle. The story has some little plot twists ,aside from the big ones which hit you like a bus,But the real gems are the little ones that make you say hey wait a minute...A really enjoyable series with lots to think about.Beautifully shot in HD than scaled down for DVD ,looks super on a nice TV"
5,The Best Season of TV EVER!,Do you want to watch the greatest show ever created and the best season of it so far?
4,Must see!! Can't put down!! Addictive TV junk food!!,"This is not ordinarily the type of show I would watch--it took someone buying me the series for Christmas to get me to watch it--but once I tried it, I could not stop watching--my husband too. He told me he was surprised at how much he liked it and was interested in seeing what happened it season two.This is TV Junk food at it's finest--and no wonder--the talented David Fury is one of the producers and writers--from Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.Watch it, GET LOST!!"
2,"Kinda, well, boring!!","I think there was a compilation of like 6 episodes out of 24 that kept my interest. I tried to like it, but the more I watched, the more painful it got to sit through an entire snooze-fest episode. I actually found myself fast forwarding so that I could see when something interesting would happen.How can people find this show amazing. There's an episode about playing golf, an episode about building a raft, taking a shower, picking fruit, and even drinking water. COME ON! I hardly consider this entertainment. It wasnt horrible, but I dont think I'll be watching the second season. If I were you, I would watch the first and last episode. Everthing else is boring filler."
3,"Interesting, but not enouhgt....","Very nice buid up for this story in the begining, but towards the end the story starts to loose it's appeal... If you want a nice past time for the weekend, go for the 24. Kieffer rules ;)"
1,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. VERY DISAAPOINTED!!,THIS WAS HORRIBLE! THE CASE WAS BROKEN FIRST OF ALL (AND THE BROKEN PIECE WAS A DANGER TO ANIMALS AND SMALL CHILDREN) AND THEN WHEN WE GOT TOTALLY INTO THE SERIES AND WENT TO PUT IN DISC 4 AND FOUND 2 DISC 5S INSTEAD!!!!!!!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK. AND I WANT A BLU-RAY DISC 4 PLEASE. THIS WAS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY HUSBAND AND HE IS VERY DISAPPOINTED.
5,THIS SHOW IS OFF DA HOOK!!,"This show will basically make you scream out ""WHAT??"" or ""HOLY CRAP!"". Althought the cliff-hangers is not as good as 24, but all the mysterious events leading to each other is as great as the book Da Vinci Code. If you haven't seen this yet, u're totally missing out. Yea the story of people crashing on an island seems like a boring series, but it is not only the crash that made this interesting, but every character's flash backs, and lives and the island that makes it interesting. GET THIS SERIES and join the group that will scream out ""WTF!"" while watching this."
3,"on the whole, dumb","There are snatches of good writing, but on balance a forgettable effort.One thing that had me hooked early was the exciting fact that, as the plane crash survivors suddenly discovered, they were not alone on the island: there was apparently some sort of invisible dinosaur prowling nearby, eager to consume them.And then the writers, in what was either a burst of hideous writing or a frightening insight into human psychology, have the survivors then proceed largely to forget about said monster, spending the rest of the season playing golf, going for a swim, getting a tan, etc.Won't be watching season two."
2,Incomplet information about the product,"Good product but the problem is the language,,,only english,,,and this information doesn`t appear on the description of the product,,,"
3,'Lost' it's touch...,"I can't tell you how over Lost we are now... This is the first television series we have bought on DVD and probably won't be buying on again - it's overkill. There's just too many questions, not enough answers.We have to wait until February 2006 until we even get a look-in to the next session in Australia. That's enough to put me off... I'm not a patient person"
4,lost,"As many of you might have seen this series already in the states this is for the British as we are only half way through it, The series starts off really well but seems to me to start lagging, And as with most series leaves you wanting more at the end if you want to know what? why? and who are are the people on the Island well guess what it leaves you hanging surpise.but all in all very good"
5,Lost Season 1,This show is one of the best shows on tv. The first year was totally amazing especially the season premier! You would love this show!
3,Minor Problem with the DVD,"I had a problem with the Season 1 DVD set in that the commentaries wouldn't play. I learned this too late to request a new set. So far, I cannot locate the audio track on the DVD."
4,LOST-THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON,"Very pleased. I placed the order just after Thanksgiving and it arrived in Okinawa, Japan for my granddaughter just in time for Christmas. She also received seasons 2 & 3 so she can watch LOST for a long time. Thank you for your quick response."
5,Lost Season 1,"There's not much I can add to the review, other than, this is a great series and worth the price and time spent watching."
5,You will get Lost with watching the series,This series is very good got good actors and a lot of mystery and suspense I give it 5 stars out of 5 for its production values. You can tell that it is a JJ Abrams (the creator of Alias) where they start at the end of the story and work back. So if you enjoy action/adventure suspense you will enjoy this season and the next season.
5,Need I say more?,Unless you live on another planet there really is very little to say about this show. This set comes with a good array of extras and is definitely worth a purchase.
1,I never recieved it!,"I never recieved this product but being a huge Lost fan, trust me anyone that buys this will ultimatley enjoy it.!!"
2,"not that I don't like this show, but..","As a Korean, I must comment that the korean acting/ writing is atrocious. Except for the girl, the guy and the flashback actors that speak korean butcher it to a point where many KOreans won't be able to understand it unless they write it down. I'm most certain that the show spends several milion dollars per - I just hope they get some better actors for season 2"
2,Awful,"I have to say I loathe Lost, in the UK we are on approx episode 10 and each one is more ludicrous than the last, boys that make things happen? Evil numbers? And the acting is dire, Kate has two expressions, constipated or head leaning on shoulder, she is NOT sexy! And where do they get all they freshly laundered clothes and new wardrobe each week, does the French woman run them something up?It is trying too hard to be 'wacky', when it has episodes which deal with living on the island and general relationships it is so much better."
2,Shallow plot details/ NWO propaganda tool,"I can appreciate the setting of the storyline... Nobody can deny that Oahu Hawaii is an island paradise but I think the screenwriting for this series is too shallow and dysfunctional. The plot flits and undulates with a shallow orchestration. Too many cheesy and modernized takes on pop culture seem to bog down this schizophrenic, and brain-damaged weekly video hopelessness. It may be paradise but it surely is paradise LOST.If you choose to waste your time on this series feature, you will have too many attempts to overthrow a simple faith in God to withstand at one time, such as the lie that death is not dying, Catholic faith constitutes true Christianity, romantic relationships with multiple partners is a good thing. This series represents everything that is wrong with our world and none seem to be speaking up about it. It is addictive, but definitely in a bad and morally-depraved mode. Please find a faithful way to spend your time."
5,Best TV series,"The LOST series is basically about the survivors of a trans-oceanic flight who mysteriously crash and wake up on an island. But the season is more than that, exploring the ""back story"" of the characters as the show progresses. It includes a good mix of comedy, and intricately linked together mysteries. Season one comes as a set of 6 or 7 DVDs - each disc holds 4 episodes and some bonus material. Season one is basically about the crash on the island, and an introduction to the characters. It ends with the discovery of ""the Others"" and a mysterious hatch."
5,This is how a DVD set is done!,"I just finished blasting the House DVD set for its poor presentation of a great series, and Lost came in the mail. I was really impressed not only by the 5.1 sound, but the mixing as well. In CSI, for example, the sound is 5.1, but there is little benefit to it. Here, the mixing is wondeful, and if you want proof, just listen to the first time the thing in the forest starts roaring and moving trees! Furthermore, this one is in beautiful anamorphic widescreen. The care in production is on a par with the Star Trek DVD's, but at a far lower price. If I must register a complaint, it is in the package itself. What is with this new thing where each disk is staggered over another? If you want disk 2, you have to remove disk 1 to get at it, and so forth. Nevertheless, this is a must buy. I hope other producers look to this as a gold standard for DVD sets."
5,Excellent!,"Lost is totally worth the asking price. It's absolutely fab, and being over in Britain, it's exciting because I've seen all the episodes before other people over here.The product was delivered within 3 to 4 days from America, in perfect condition, which I was very pleased about. And I spent the next week watching every single episode with my dad and brother who are also fans. But we are now bummed that we have to wait until next year to watch the next series... which I will be buying on DVD again from this site!"
5,Simply great,"Lost is Awesome, best show ever, cant stop watching, quality is great, streaming is great no issues, the theme of the show is great."
5,You Will Be Hooked!,I did not start off watching this on the telly. I had pneumonia while visiting friends. They set it up on the DVD player. I turned it on at 10 Am. At 7 PM they came home to ask if I had even left the couch. I had watched nearly the whole season in one work day. It was so good. It left me wanting more.This series will leave you addicted and begging for more. The first season is seriously wonderful stuff. I could easily re watch it. This is a must own DVD set. I have managed to get many others hooked on it. I have only met one person who watched it and disliked it. His complaint was that it was too close toThe Bridge of San Luis Rey (Perennial Classics).
2,Great start at least...,"This show started off really well. High drama, good acting, interesting subplots...Then it turned into a soap opera version of ""Land of the Lost"" - Where are the Sleestak when you need them? The way this show is spinning out of control, I bet that those scaly guys will make an appearance soon.I think that the problem with shows like this is that network television writers are'nt that talented. So even if you hand them a good idea, they'll eventually mess it up.The first few episodes are worth watching at least."
3,lost a bunch of ego,i felt that the doctor in this show is out of control and should not be the leader. i look forward to seeing him go. other that i liked the show it is not your normal tv show the polts had great turns and the flash backs added to the show and the polt. i like the buying of the whole season you can realy get into the show.
5,Get On Your Jammies And Get Ready For A Marathon!,"My son got this for Christmas. I had not watched it at all until the last three episodes of season 2. He thought I ought to see the first year to get caught up on the storyline and about each person. WOW! ""Let's watch one more episode.""""Just one more, please."" ""Stay awake with me to watch one more and then we can all go to bed."" Were just a few of the statements I made. We stayed up watching until 2 AM the first night. At 10 AM the next morning, our houseguests were ready for us to begin the next episode.You will not tire of this and I can see us next Christmas watching Seasons I and II in a marathon."
4,A little meandering but pretty good,"I enjoyed the first two disks the most. It seems like the writers got a little ""Lost"" themselves because they seemed to lose plot lines for a while and then pick them up after 5 or 6 episodes. It's a little frustrating because it feels like there is no resolution to anything in the show."
4,Malfunctioning disc.,"I would just like to emphasize on the product.Well,the first disc was working fine the first few days but then it started malfunctioning.While the rest of the discs work perfectly fine.However,Lost is a soul sucking,adrenaline thrill ride.It's worth buying."
3,Okay,"The dvd was backordered and that wasn't the issue. I emailed the seller twice and finally got a response, so time for answering inquiries too slow. I did get the product but again my question was when will we get this as it is for Christmas."
3,Great Show Terrible DVD,"Why is it that nearly every time I get interested in a TV show enough to buy the DVD that I'm always dissapointed. This in my opinion is a well written and acted show. Thoroughly entertaining. However, the DVD set is horendous. This is the first I've bought one of these sets and not opened it to find a million scratches on the back of at least one of the DVDs, but that doesn't mean it plays any better. I can't even watch the teaser on episode 3. It just spits and sputters. I am seriously tired of paying so much money for poor quality. These studios should really consider the efects of poor packaging, scratched DVDs, and bad burns."
5,The best show I have ever seen,"This show has become so captivating for my weds evenings. I never thought any show would be better than Friends but this far surpasses it. This show is a wonderful combination of suspense, drama, and action. The never ending plot twists and turns will keep viewers tunning in every week. There is a little something for everyone: Action, thrills, love, death, history, etc. There is nothing I will recommend to anyone any higher than this captivating show."
4,Good Series,Good story line that keeps you coming back for more. We look forward to watching the conclusion of this first season and will likely move on to watching season 2.
3,lost,not one that i would care for but it is okay it does keep you wondering what happens next. so you have to keep watching
5,Lost - The First Complete Season,Exciting! Thrilling! Only up to episode seven but already has us on the edge of our seats. We are trying to space out episodes but it is hard to do when a series is this good.
4,LOST Season 1,"I,ve heard alot about this series for years and Im really enjoying it. It's got my curiosity going, I'm ready to get season 2."
5,Lost Complete First Season DVD's,"My wife loved this compilation of Lost episodes from the first season. Actually very nicely done, with extras."
2,Boring,"Colleagues recommended to me after Prison Break ended, it's so not interesting to me. I am not comparing to PB but LOST is very boring and i was LOST after a few episodes but i guess since I find it boring it's hard to catch on and concentrate. Cute looking cast thou."
3,Lost - first season,"Enjoying the content, but 2nd CD has scratches on it - so had some difficulty viewing it."
3,Spanish!!!,Its a great series that I would have happily purchased for relatives if there had been either subtitles or a spanish language track. On what planet does it make sense to publish digital content in only one language?
3,"Great start, but steady decline","Although the first half of the season is great, the plot becomes increasingly implausible towards the end of the season, as the writers awkwardly stall in answering the mysteries introduced at the beginning. The stalling tactics start to become more obvious (and less plausible) as the season progresses, resulting in some tiresome scenes. Because of the quality first half, I give it a 3. The degradation of the script attests to the fact that the overall concept is fundamentally flawed - you can't maintain the sense of mystery on an island over several seasons without resorting to boring filler."
1,does not live up to its promises,"This first season of Lost was intriguing, and many of us became invested in watching the series, only to become disillusioned and soured over time. In retrospect, the flaws in Season 1 are now clear because they are repeated -- and only get worse -- in the next seasons.This series added mystery on top of mystery, question on top of question, new characters on top of old, until it just wore me out. Never gives any answers, and the plot never really moves forward -- which is apparent in the first season, if you look carefully.Don't get hooked! Don't waste your time! Save yourself while you still can!"
2,Little better that others.,"Completely unrealistic film. Heroes of that film has fault all their challenges. However, second season now started.I think, author would show us a full disability modern man to live together at closed society.P.S. sorry about my english."
2,more Vincent the Dog!,"I don't normally watch a lot television; the wonders of Netflix have made it so I don't need cable ever again. so, I've managed to avoid the hype until my sister insisted that I borrow her 1st season DVD.I wanted to give Lost a chance, because I think the premise of the show is interesting; combining a disaster with a fantasyesque background, as well as infusing the plot with elements of numerology, redemption, etc. However, I just can't get into it. I'm not really surprised or enchanted by any of the characters and their plight (with the possible exception of John Locke and Vincent the Dog.) And even with John Locke's character, they could have at least made his name somewhat ambigious, instead of naming him directly after the philosopher. The storyline is predictable, at best, and the characters seem to constantly use cliched phrases. I don't really have a desperate desire to see Season 2.Now, if the producers of Arrested Development could get their act together..."
1,Wish I could,"I wish I could review this item, but I was charged for it and never got it. Filed a claim and haven't heard anything yet."
3,there's no booklet that has the episode list,"My first grip is that there's no booklet that has the episode list. So unless you have them memorized you will have to stick in every disc to find the episode you want.Second, this SEASON PLAY, really sucks. I don't know if its my DVD player that just doesn't remember that I created a profile for season play or if its a flaw in the disc. I even plugged in a memory card stick to see if it will save my profile but it didn't. So the SEASON PLAY is annoying. It just doesn't remember you and it asks you ever time you press play an episode ""Would you like to play this using SEASON PLAY?"" Annoying.Third complaint is no booklet for the episode guide. That's an important missing feature on ALL of these Blu-ray Lost discs that is not included on any of the seasons.Am I starting to sound repetitive?1080p is great but no episode guide included."
5,Couldn't stop watching!,"Lost, yet another great tv series. I watched it when it aired originally and it was even better watching the second time around. The suspense and drama pull you into the story."
3,Some chapter won't run.,"Despite my calling to Amazon Support without getting a reasonable answer for my streaming problem,and despite my installing over and over again of the flash player on my Imac, some chapters from the series just wont run. It keep giving the same error "" your flash player needs updating "" or something to that effect.Besides that, I good experience and great quality on the chapters I was able to enjoy."
4,Lost in the craze,"This is my new favorite TV show! Lost is smart, funny, thrilling...everything I like to watch. Plus the guys are hot! This DVD set is great. It's got behind the scenes, interviews, and Easter Eggs that are plain hysterical. If you are even a partial fan of this show, this is a DVD set to buy."
5,Quick Delivery!,I really liked this DVD Box set of LOST.I only took one week with free delivery.Awsome!
3,Good Show but........,GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!My wife and I started watching this show from the first episode.I quickly got frustrated as the plot seems to just drag on and on. Remindes me of a prime time soap opera. (You can not watch the show for weeks at a time and still miss nothing)They have been trying to open that hatch for weeks.What do we get for the final??? NOTHING!!!I vowed to not watch the show again untill it comes out on DVD (season 2 that is)If you like longggggggggggggg drawn out stories then this is the show for you. I don't mind a little drama but this is a gun fight where the bad guy never dies (he just keeps getting up and kidnapping the girl)GET ON WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,What a shame,"Incredible series, incredible price...But why, oh why, this box set doesn't have spanish, french or other subtitles ? Not every U.S. resident, or amazon.com customer speaks english as a native language. Nor every boxset is sold only in the U.S.This isn't any TV series. This one deserves a better treatment. If you only knew how useful is for us (foreigners) having other language subtitles and dubbing options.I'd like to buy LOST with other language options. And I'm not the only one that thinks so... I'm far from being the only one!"
5,Watch it again for the first time...,"It is a fantastic show and watching it again, without advertisements breaking it up, was even more thrilling. You pick up connections you may have previously missed and if you love the cast now, wait until you see them in the special features. They are so funny and loveable. Great box set. I will buy the next season without hesitation"
5,One of the best new series in quite some time...,"I've been living overseas the last several years, so I was totally unaware of Lost until I came across it on Amazon. The plot synopsis sounded intriguing so I took a chance...What a great surprise! My wife and I couldn't pull ourselves away from the DVDs. The show seemed like a combination of X-files, Survivor, and Gilligan's Island. OK a little less of the latter, but the people are stranded on an Island with bizarre/strange/funny things happening. The only disappointing thing about the DVD collection was that it had to end! Living in Europe, we feared that we would have to wait until the DVD release next fall, but the TV powers that be decided to start selling Season 2 on the internet. As with most of the better DVD sets, Lost comes packed with extras which are a great bonus."
4,MY GRANDDAUGHTER (8) LOVES IT. FAVORITE TOY!,My grandduaghter saw ad on tv and I got it for her. Sh loves it especially because she found out that she can turn it into a puppy again to grow again. Its the pet she can't have due to allergies.
2,Expensive Toy Not Worth the Price,"I bought this as a gift for my little sister who is 7 years old. She is an absolute dog fanatic so I thought this would be ideal since she is too young to care for a real dog. She was excited when she opened the gift since she had previously seen commercials selling it. Once we programmed it, there was not much to do with it except feed it a bone, measure it when it grows (once a day for 4 days), and brush it's short curly hair.I was hoping for it to be a little more interactive such as say things on its own or sing songs on its own. Basically, it only talks when you press the button on its head. I would recommend this toy for children that are of much younger age. It also shouldn't be priced this high!I wish I could return it since she played for it for about a day. Then she gave up with it and I could have used my money on something more educational and worthwhile."
2,"Cute, but frustrating without a usb cable","Cute toy, but it was a huge problem Christmas day when there was no USB cable. I accused my daughter of having lost the usb cord from the box, when there was not one to begin with! This should be in HUGE type on the front of the box. Granny that gave it to her has no idea what a usb cord is and didn't know to get one. For the price, would it kill them to include it? We live in a small town and the nearest store that even might have a usb cable is 22 miles from here. YUCK."
5,Jo Jo does the trick!,"My daughter just turned 5 years old and was expecting a ""real"" dog for her birthday. With our schedule it is just impossible to take care of a puppy. So, we bought this for her. She was excited when she saw the puppy, but when the dog said her name she almost passed out. Not to mention what happened when the puppy began to grow. Needless to say, she has forgotten all about the ""real"" dog, at least for now."
4,Daughter liked it,I gave this to my daughter for her 7th birthday. She played with it constantly for the first week. Then I think she got bored with it. I personally think they could have done a better job with the voices. The voice that says the child's name doesn't sound the same as the voice that says the rest of the sentence. It sounds weird to me.
2,the puppy that ruined present time at christmas!,"I bought this toy for my 6 year old for Christmas. It looked so cute and seemed like a really fun toy for a little girl. But be warned before you purchase..puppy grows and may not know your name! I put in the cd to program the puppy and my child's name was not there in any spelling variation. her name is gabrielle. not exactly an unusual name. no gabrielle, gabby, gabbie, gabe, gabriella, gabriel..nothing. But hey, if your name is genesis or apple or rhododendron, it's your lucky day! I'm not kidding. those names were on the list. needless to say, she was crying because we had to tell her that her name wasn't on the list. I called fisher price and they told me that if her name wasn't there, it wasn't there. nothing they could do. so we gave it to her sister. she is sad. thanks fisher price."
2,software doesn't work,"installed the software for this puppy. the application launches (you can see in the task manager), never pops up a window, and then terminates (again, watched it die in the task manager)...the website has _no_ software updates for this toy (it's worse than that, there's not even a section for software updates!).The dog itself is cute, and is neat by itself. but... it does NOT live up to it's promise. The software is _really_ poor quality, if it can't give an error message, and quits without errors... worth the money? not really - especially if you can't get the software to work. we have windows xp with service pack 3 on a laptop..."
2,"Try ""The Endless Night of White Chickens"", vos.","Whilst this book was worth reading, talk about stringing out a story. Normally a book takes me a week maximum to read...this took me MONTHS. It was starting to feel like a part of my anatomy."
2,the long book about white chickens,"the sporatic time construction in the story line causes the reader to have to wade through the same scene over and over again, some times even described with the exact same wording. The book would not have suffered from a quick reread by a tough editor before being sent to the presses. Worth reading, the man obviously has talent and I'm going to assume the repetition and crazy time sequence was done to simulate latin american lifestyle but boy, was i ready to get to that last page."
2,Very disappointing,"As a fan of all things Latin, I really wanted to like this book, and was led to believe by reviews that it was written in the rich and fantastical style of Latin-inspired storytelling. Wrong! What could have been a compelling tale is botched up by the skilless jumps forward and backward in time. (Usually, if a good writer tells us at the outset what happens to one of the main characters -- in this case, a murder -- the subsequent description of things leading to up the the event are more interesting than the event itself. Not the case in this book). The historical framework of Guatemala is leaked in awkward places in the narrative, and the usage of Spanish-language phrases are often translated when they don't need to be, or not translated when they should be. I betcha Goldman will surprise us one day with a winner -- I think he has the core talent -- but this ain't it."
4,A bulb is a bulb,"I purchased this to repair a portable cosmetics mirror. Nothing special about it, but these bulbs are sometimes hard to find."
3,My Review of Undefeated,"First of all, something you need to know before ordering this DVD, and there is nothing in the product information that would indicate this. This DVD is about the 1968 undefeated team, NOT the 2002 undefeated team.The DVD is hosted by a radio personality from Columbus, and he interviews Coach Earl Bruce, and a player from the team, Larry Zelina. They briefly discuss the entire season, game by game, and then show highlights of each game, after the discussion. With one exception, the highlights of the Rose Bowl game are minimal, and done as the video end credits run.The game film is black and white, but not bad considering the age, and has been digitally remastered. Overall, not bad, and a good ""history lesson"" of one of OSU's all time great teams for the younger fans."
3,"Works great, but big annoyances","I've been using this keyboard and mouse for 6 months now. Technically they work quite well (per other reviews).However, the annoyances leave me unimpressed:1. The thumb button on the mouse is way too low. It is so uncomfortable to use that I rarely do use it - even though I programmed it for the same double-click I use constantly at work on MS hardware.2. The right shift key is half the size of my MS Natural keyboards - for no apparent reason. I'm constantly missing it.3. In general, I feel I'm working much harder on the Logitech keyboard. I type very quickly, and I find my hands get tired and fingertips irritated. I certainly have to hit the backspace a lot more frequently (meaning I'm mistyping) compared to the MS Natural keyboards.Bottom line for me: I will continue to use this keyboard and mouse, but I would not buy them again."
2,Nice keyboard but high key pressure makes it difficult to type,"I used this keyboard/mouse for over a year. I like the ergonomic shape and the wireless capability. However, I threw them aside when my hands started to hurt from typing and mousing. After looking at a few other keyboards, I realized just how difficult this keyboard's keys were to press. The mouse also takes some effort and is abnormally heavy for a mouse.Overall, I would not recommend buying this product because of the strain you will be putting on your hands and wrists."
3,"Nice keyboard, bad mouse","The keyboard is very nice, but if you type really really fast you will experience a very slight delay when you watch the screen.I dual boot windows 2000 and SuSE Linux 9.1, the keyboard and mouse work in both systems. There are some concerns regarding security, since everything you type is broadcast to the world (although I am certain the range is quite limited). On the other hand, some wired keyboards can be monitored by analysing the sound they make when you type. Do your computing in a soundproof bunker with a Faraday cage if you're worried ""they"" may be watching you.Even within ten centimeters of the receiver, the cordless mouse performs with about as much precision as a brainsurgeon with cerebral palsy. I also own the logitech MX500 and this cordless thing doesn't even come close to it's accuracy.Great keyboard, bad mouse. Hence 3 stars out of 5."
4,Logitech Ergonomic Cordless Keyboard and Mouse,"The product is outstanding. The problem is that the keyboard is black, and it is difficult to see the keys when one wears glasses. My overall rating would be 5/5 if it were not for the color being black."
1,Spacebar problems,"I love logitech keyboards. They are the only keyboards I ever buy for my several computers at home. I've been wanting an ergonomic keyboard for a long time, but when I received this one I had a lot of trouble with the spacebar sticking. So, I figured it was a defect and I returned it for a replacement. The spacebar on the second one also sticked. I tried to see if I would be able to live with it because I really like the logitech keyboards and I really wanted the ergonomic one, but it was super annoying, especially when using Linux. There was no way I could use this keyboard."
3,Long and drawn out.,"Although it isn't in the list of the Joanna Blalock series, Brainwaves is the 8th book in the series. Dr. Karen Crendall, a noted neurologist was found dead in Memorial Hospital. Simon Murdock is convinced it was a suicide. Jake & Joanna disagree. Dr. Crandall was on the verge of a medical breakthrough using brain tissue DNA to recapture aural and visual memories. Joanna and Jake are convinced it was murder. But to prove their case they have to use the victim's revolutionary research and enter the recesses of Dr. Crandall's mind to unveil a killer hidden in memory's darkest realm.Lately, the books by Leonard Goldberg have been either really good or really bad. Unfortunately, the bad ones have outweighed the good. Brainwaves was just too long and drawn out. The very beginning was great and I thought I had another thriller in my hands but it wasn't to be. It was ok, but I wouldn't rush out to read it."
5,buy this or God will not forgive you,"the best. . .sorry. . .the BEST of modern writers. clever, sarcastic, lucid, even profound, april is the coolest thing since some guys named gershwin. her partnership with david hungate is the hippest thing in nashville. I have played my copy of this so often, the cd laser has burned a hole in the disc. playing this record will make your plants bloom; it will make your emerson boombox sound good; it will make stains leap up from your carpet. this record will change your life."
2,Close but no cigar,"I listened to this CD with high hopes, because I love this style of music. However, I was disappointed to find that several of the best songs come straight from Suzy Bogguss' album ""Swing"" (My Dream Is You, Jumpin' Into Spring, Burning the Toast), and Bogguss does a much better job with the material. I find that I DO like the instrumentals in ""I'm Beginning to See the Light"", and Barrows does an adequate job with the rest of the albums content. She seems to lack that ""smokey"" quality, though, that makes the singers of this genre so great. My advice is to listen to a few tracks from Bogguss' ""Swing"" before you buy this album, then decide."
5,revolutionary!,"This book contains profound wisdom of the ages; beyond time, beyond our physical existence. Schools and universities do not teach us about the secrets to find permanent happiness and inner peace. In fact, this is a mystery to many, many people.Who are we? Why are we here? What is our purpose in life? Who can answer these questions? This book opens our eyes and mind to a new vision. We alone can find the answer to all our questions, by looking within.This book introduces the methods to a new and practical way of living. It brings us onto a new journey to discover the treasures beyond this three dimensional world."
2,Nothing Special,"To me, the writing seemed fragmented and incohesive. There are volumes upon volumes of better types of books available on psychology, sociology and spiritual matters."
4,Get to Know The Personal Side of Dr. von Braun,"Well written, informative look at the personal side of Dr. von Braun's life from birth to his untimely death from cancer. Plenty of details about his work with rockets and his influence on America's space program. Many quotes from people who knew Dr. von Braun personally. A thoughtful look at his triumphs and his tragedies. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of rocketry and space exploration as well as anyone who likes to learn more about leaders who inspire people to succeed."
5,Best von Braun biography out there,"Very balanced look at Wernher von Braun's rocket pioneering life and, in my opion, the best biography out there. Ward addresses von Braun's V2 development efforts in Germany, but doesn't let that overshadow his later accomplishments in the US developing the Redstone and Saturn rockets."
2,wrong biography for me,"This was not the biography of Dr.von Braun I wanted to read. The book is overloaded with some trivia stuff from his life, it is full of quotations of what other people had to say about some events, some of that is outright boring and marginally interesting. I was looking for a biography that would conncentrate on his work, what technical, scientific, human, political obstacles he faced developing all the rockets and the Saturn rockets in particular, what tradeoffs he faced, what were the key challenges, etc. There is practically nothing in this book on this topic. I know there are other books on Dr.von Braun and I should turn my attention at them next."
5,Excellent Book,"The Gates of Hell will not prevail against the Catholic Church. God himself spoke those words. I would advise the enemies of the Church to heed those wise words.If Satan and his demons cannot destroy the Church, im pretty sure mere humans will not.God Bless Mr. Crocker, it is time a book like this has been written for the lay faithful."
2,Anti-Italian and ignorant,As an Italian-American I found this book to be patently offensive. The author takes every opportunity to slander and defame the Italian people making snide remarks as often as possible. His view of Italian immigrants reminded me of reading Jacob Riis with its turn-of-the-century ignorance. Crocker also does not seem to have a good grasp of Irish Catholic history and has an obvious bent toward mother England. Perhaps that's his Anglican background shining through. It's obvious this book has an agenda and I specifically don't recommend it for the impressionable recent convert for this reason.
4,Great start,"This book is startling. It is not intended to be a full blown academic history, it is designed to grab your attention as you browse through Barnes and Noble (just look at the cover!) and is meant to be an introduction to those who perhaps would never have given the Catholic Church much credence. It does this job admirably well. Condensing two thousand years into fewer than five hundred pages? Yes, you have to take a few shortcuts and I do not blame him for it in the slightest. It is an excellent introduction to history.There is a better, more academic, history out there, however, and it is William Carroll's ""History of Christendom."" If this book has whet your appetite for Christendom's history, how the Catholic Church is THE founder of Western Civilization, I HIGHLY recommend it."
4,A Protestant even likes it.,"Even though I'm a Protestant, I loved the book for the first century and a half of Church History. The treatment of the Reformation is quite disappointing but enlightening to a Protestant reader to hear the Catholic prospective. Crocker also seems less inclined to leave be the mystery of grace and faith in order to get in digs on Protestants; maybe he should read more Augustine. Come on, ""Evangelicals and Catholics Together"", get on the bandwagon!"
5,Completely Surprised,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Discovering our Church's rich history was incredible. I learned so much and recommend this book to anyone who wants to know where we came from.
2,A great disappointment,Triumph was excessively opinionated and poluted by its overuse of emotionally charged adjectives. It read like a campaign speech. Its liberal use of undefined French phrases was an annoying distraction.The lack of respect shown for members of other faiths was unkind and out of place in an era of ecumenism.
2,Useful but slanted,"As a committed Catholic I looked forward to reading this book and it was initially all I hoped for, telling the tale of the history of the Bride of Christ in riveting detail.The author's desire to stuff his own political predilictions into the text, however, drive it off the rails as one reaches modern times.Just an example: The Civil War is identified as the War Between the States. The description of the Church's reaction to slavery in the South seems to suggest that slavery wasn't such a bad thing, after all.My suggestion: stop reading it once the 19th Century arrives."
1,"Nice narrative, misleading history.","This book's author is a convert to Roman Catholicism, and the book reads like it: while a ""cradle Catholic"" [sic] would take a balanced approach to Roman Catholicism, weighing the bad with the good, Crocker provides a crock, er, a heavily weighted apologia for Roman Catholicism. Especially interesting is his discussion of the break with the Orthodox, wherein a position that never had been doctrinal before suddenly becomes the measure of ""true"" Christianity, and Crocker finds this perfectly reasonable!If you are a committed Roman Catholic who does not know much about the history of Christianity, this book's bias will not bother you and its cheerleading will appeal; otherwise, try a different title (say, Gregory Palamas's _The Triads_)."
5,Triumph is a triumph,"2000 years of history condensed into less than 500 pages and told in a page-turner manner. The bias in this book is clearly pro-Catholic, but the history, in itself, is compelling and speaks for itself. Finally, a piece of well-referenced material covering the papacy and Catholicism from its foundation in Jesus Christ and culminating in the present age. This book is a must for anyone wanting a concise history of the Catholic Church!"
5,okay,"Pretty good but a little week in the treatment of the Gallieo affair. Gallieo gets off too easy. And he gets t0o much of the credit for what was actually the work of Churchmen.Example, we often he of Gallieo dropping various size objects off the Pisa Tower. In fact, he probably never did this Instead, he just plagiarized the works of his Jesuit professors from 50 yearS prior."
5,Group Study,Loved this in a group setting. Ordered in bulk at the time. Came undamaged and in good time frame. Would order again.
5,unusual in a good way,"finally someone who understands the realities of the mystery of the Holy Roman Catholic Church wrote a book about it. Very refreshing to an US born Catholic who hears non stop criticism and often times wicked lies about the Holy Mother Church. Crocker puts things into perspective while not being afraid to be on the side of the Church because of its undeniable truth once you get past the prejudice. Too bad it took such a long time for me to find a book like this. Its helping I (as a Catholic convert) make sense out of the stories of religions of the Western World. This is not to say I would always stand by his viewpoint, but its great to finally hear someone say it and be unabashed."
4,A great book,"A great book and a wonderful history. It is also full of good humor and pulls no punches. In light of so much bad history, this book is one we can almost not do without. The only reason to drop a star is that the author is just a little to flippant about the, shall we say, un-chaste hierarchy that was featured during much of the Renaissance."
4,"Slow reading, but great book for learning about the history of the Catholic religion.","Slow reading, but great book for learning about the history of the Catholic religion. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,History couldn't be better!,Triumph: The Power and the Glory of the Catholic Church is a history book like no other. It actually makes reading history enjoyable! The material is easy to read and understandable. It is much like reading a story. You won't even remember it's a history book that you're reading!
5,Inspiring and long-overdue praise for the Church,"Crocker has delivered a witty, insightful, gloriously honest account of Roman Catholicism's history in his TRIUMPH. Like many faithful to Rome, I had become disgusted with the latest wave of anti-Catholic literature recently published, such as CONSTANTINE'S SWORD and PAPAL SIN. In TRIUMPH, Crocker has furnished Catholic and non-Catholic alike with an accurate account of Church history which, while admitting the eccelesiatical history of Rome is not without stain, remains a joyous, uninhibited procession through over two millennia of the One True Faith. Kudos, Mr. Crocker, and ad multos annos!"
2,Hyperbolic Nonsense,"The Catholic Information Center of Washington DC recommends ""Triumph"" on its impressive Lifetime Reading Plan list so when I saw it at the bookstore I had no reservations about it being reliable ""history."" For the sake of its own credibility, the CIC should remove this book immediately. I should've paid more attention to the back cover which touts Crocker as being a former political speech writer and that explains much. Crocker's history is fast-paced, exciting and pure hyperbolic nonsense! In the first half of the book, he blames everything on the Eastern Orthodox Church and the second half on those schismatic reformers who had nothing better to do than challenge the glorious authority those noble Romans. This book should be an embarrassment to the CIC, or anyone else who claims to seek the truth. The only thing that prevents me from giving this one star is that Crocker should be given credit for spinning a good yarn."
2,Unpleasent Surpirse.,"The book does provide a valuable and entertaining sketch of the history of the Catholic Church and Europe over the last 2,000 years. However the overt bigotry of the author is reminiscent of Rush Limbaugh. I am a devout Catholic, however I (unlike the author) believe that many non-Catholics will end up in Heaven!The author has completely missed the point of Vatican II and his partial distortion of Humanae Vitae is disturbing."
1,Broke again within days,"The original part lasted about five years, which is pretty poor for something like a toaster which I expect to last a decade or more.The replacement part lasted five days. I'm demoralized. It broke in exactly the same way: when the timer reaches the 'off' position instead of 'dinging' and stopping it keeps going on round to the 'on' position. This flaw almost set my kitchen on fire. Maybe there's a timer out there that doesn't break easily, but this isn't it."
1,Impossible to Listen To,"Do NOT buy this recording. The recording quality of this set is so bad that I threw it away after struggling through most of one CD. GALA opera CDs are ""hit or miss"", and this one is the worst. It is literally the worst recorded sound I have ever heard commercially released. The whole thing sounds like someone shouting down a pipe. It's a shame because the cast has some excellent singers, but you wouldn't know it from this recording. GALA should be ashamed of themselves for even releasing it."
1,Unfortunately Incomplete,"I had purchased this book hoping to give it to a new sacristan, but was forced to discard it, first of all because it has a loose and sometimes incorrect presentation of the Church's understanding of the mass and what is neccessary for it: ""many parishes prefer to bake their own bread;"" ""Prepare a large pitcher with wine"", ""work to build up a set of vessels of various materials, including metal, ceramic, and glass"", etc. Secondly, however, the book lacks the basics needed for a sacristan: while there are some lists of items needed in a sacristy, there is no comprehensive lists, care instructions, how to fold a corporal, how to clean altar linens, etc."
5,What to say?,"These are sharp and cost a lot. Buy the largest quantity that you can, comes up a lot cheaper per blade. Many times you can get away with single edge razor blades, without the comfortable handle."
4,THE MASTER HIMSELF,"It's so refreshing to hear the familiar Leroy Anderson gems played by the master himself. I thought the sound was not as clear as what I have on LP versions, but that may be just an illusion. BLUE TANGO is here, and THE TYPEWRITER, and many others. My favourite is SARABAND. Altogether, a most enjoyable set, with the music of Anderson played by Anderson. (Oh, when will they release A CHRISTMAS FESTIVAL on CD?)"
3,Great game - horrible quality of materials and manufacturing,Great game but quality leaves something to be desired. Wood box was very poorly put together with blotches of wood putty in corners. Numbers flimsy and difficult to move. I would recommend finding a different manufacturer of this great game as it is not unique to them.
3,"Shut ""Shut the Box"".","I liked the game but I've ended up playing it alone because no one else seems to like playing it at all. The consensus seemed to be, ""That's why they call it 'Shut the Box""."
3,Small but fun,It was way smaller than expected but well made for the price. It is a bit smaller than a cigar box. The dice are made for ants.
3,"Good game, bad quality","I love this game. It requires, thought and strategy, and is quite addictive once you get started. Even my young Nephew cannot stop playing with it. However, the quality is very poor. Is three stars harsh when I love the game, but am disappointed with the craftsmanship? No. The tiles constantly get flipped backward and everytime I tried to fix the tiles they would get stuck or the other half of the tiles fall backward underneath the bar. When you like a game this much, but the quality is poor, it really is a let down.On the other hand, my Nephew specifically requested this as a birthday gift from me, and I certainly will oblige. He is under 10 years old and loves the game. In a day when video games are all the rage, his liking of the game will be worth the money, regardless of the poor quality."
3,Fine for the price,"Box is fine for the price. I was just looking for something of a little better quality that will last forever. I am returning it and likely going to order a higher end version. The felt does not cover the entire floor of the box (its two separate pieces for some reason). The bar that holds the tiles in place is flimsy. Box, handle and latch look decent."
1,No dice,"This picture is deceiving. It shows dice, but it came without dice. How are you supposed to play the game?"
3,Not as represented,The game is a much smaller box than the one in the video. More cigar box size. Otherwise quality appears good. Not table top size at all.
4,Much fun,We ordered this to be used with our visiting children and grandchildren for Christmas. It was a hit. Everyone enjoyed playing this game. Ages 10 up had a ball.
5,game for the whole family,We love the Shut the Box game. We like to have competitions between family members to see who can win the most games. It is a lot of fun.
5,"Love it, but it never came from Amazon","I ordered this game from Amazon for Christmas, and it never came, and they could not reorder it. So, I purchased it from a local educational toy store. We love it! Ours is a bit more durable than that shown (our case is metal with felt lining)and the number tiles are more like glass than what is pictured here. Everyone loved playing it. You can play alone or with others. Also a great math game! Just beware of Amazon shipping!"
4,Front Porch Classics,"This is a quick game and easy to travel with. My Grandson, who is in kidnergarden, is learning his addition by playing this game. I will be buying a larger box for the home."
2,Heather,This game is fun. The picture looked much better quality than the actual item when I received it. Very flimsy and cheaply built.
3,Toy box,Much smaller than I thought it would be. It is a small replica of the origional game. Even with its smaller size it is playable.
1,Disapointed!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a fun game for everyone, [..]. I don't recall dimensions in the listing when I ordered it. It measures 8""x6.6""x3.1"". The measurements are now in the listing. I was expecting the Front Porch Classics Desk Top Circa Shut-the Box which measures 5""x10.5""x14"". The one I received is little more than a travel game. Not really the quality described in the listing[..]"
3,No bulbs,This is a nice flashlight but the bulbs burn out fast and I can't for the life of me find replacements. The light takes a sw101x 2.4 volt xenon bulb and I can't find one anywhere
4,Nice Flashlight,"I purchased two of these flashlights. I was very pleased with them. The most impressive aspect of them is their brightness. They are brighter than my 3D Maglite! The battery life isn't that long, but that's to be expected. I'd recommend these to others looking for a compact, yet very bright flashlight. I also like the solid feel, and the sturdy switch feel."
2,clear glass gemstones painted red,The gemstones that appear to be red glass are actually clear glass gemstones painted red. The description doesn't make this information clear. The photo of the item looks like 100% red glass gemstones but this is not the case.
2,i use them,i use them in my aquariums. i have blue ones and green ones. my friend's i did with red and black.they are 1 dollar a bag at the dollar store.
5,A tough item.,A truly convenient and rugged watch. It's one of the only watches that I have been able to take surfing and wear on a day to day basis for work and shores and hasn't missed a beat. It doesn't have as many features as other tide watches but I've yet to miss any of them. The 5 stars are simply on a cost/benefit scale.
5,U-Tract X-Tra for Female Urinary Tract Infection,"As occurs for many women as they get older, I have, from time to time, urinary tract infections. Physician prescribed solution was drugs which did nothing at all. The doctor's only solution was ""more drugs."" I switched to U-Tract X-Tra 120 Capsules by Progressive Labs and the problem was cured completely in three days. About once a year a urinary tract infection occurs, and each time the problem is quickly corrected with U-Tract X-Tra 120 Capsules by Progressive Labs."
1,IT WAS THE NARRATOR KILLED THE BEAST!,"I agree with Friskie, but I give it only 1 star. The real culprit here is the reader, Stefan Rudnicki. He not only gave the story a dry, straight read, but his voice is irritating beyond endurance. I attempted this audiobook at least a half-dozen times, and simply gave up due to the reader's grumbling, grating, phony basso voice."
2,Looked so promising...,"When i bought this cd I was sure I was getting some hardhouse, Hardhouse is what I got but a cheaper...immitation type. Where other hardhouse Dj's such as venom and Irene make boomy interesting tracks that make you wanna jump out of your seat, this album seems so uninspired. And like the other reviews said its good on subs, sure but it doesnt make my trunk rattle like some of the other stuff Ive heard. The tracks almost sound as if he just put the records on the platter and left them to play, not much in the creative sense. I do have to give him props though for some BADA$$ scratching in track three and throughout the cd, also he stays true to the title and doesnt play and weak house or trance, or even worse funk (cough* DJ Irene)"
4,worth a read,"Beginning the world is as Karen Armstrong admits not her best but I am pleased that I managed to get copy to read, it does tend to be heavy on masochism, and leaves you expecting more at the end but your left wanting, the Spiral Staircase fills the gaps but doesn't include the original names of certain individuals and certain events as she also admits to, I still recommend it though."
4,A strangely intimate epic.,"A family saga in the true sense of the term, this novel is leisurely in it's descriptions and scene-setting. It begins as a gentle read, and this would normally put me off, but there is real steel behind the horrific ending. Read it and weep....I did!"
3,"Great When Listened One Time, Then no","Helloween is the ultimate band,and I can say that Uli Kush is also the ultimate drummer. but in this song there is something wrong, either the guitar sound or the presence of keyboards. Helloween always has used keyboards, but they never had this much importance. The song is quite good, but after a few listens it gets kind of dull, thing that doesnt happen to ""Push"" for example. But get the album anyway, Helloween is much better than most of the other stuff out there"
3,Not as good as Lunas Rotas,"I was excited to find another album by Rosana because Lunas Rotas is an incredibly great album. I don't know the history on this CD but I think the songs are older recordings. At least one was taken off vinyl because you can here the popping while another is live. These are not bad songs but if you don't have Lunas Rotas yet, get it first."
4,"Avoiding the ""sophomore slump""","This is the second album from Rosana, an amazingly talented musician and songwriter. For those unfamiliar with her, I highly recommend her first album, ""Lunas Rotas"" before getting this one. That said, she continues her poetry on this album with some phenomenal songs, but this is not the type of album you want to listen to from beginning to end, as was her first. The best songs are ""Ya No Siento"", ""Dunas de Poemas"", ""Sonrie"", ""Si Yo Fuera Tu Amante"" y ""Navidad"", a Caribbean-style Christmas carol not actually listed on the album. The remaining songs tend to venture into unknown territory for Rosana, and it loses a lot in the attempt. Nonetheless, she will continue to strike a cord with her haunting lyrics that seem so human, yet so eloquent. In short, I recommend this album, but with the understanding that the first is far superior. Let's hope for a third album soon that will surpass these first two!"
3,CD has 12 nice songs,1. Contigo2. Domingos En El Cielo3. Ya No Siento4. Dime5. Amainara6. Dunas De Poemas7. El Dia Que Se Hizo Tarde8. Sonrie9. Si Yo Fuera Tu Amante10. Pa' Calor11. El Dia Que Se Hizo Tarde - (with Maria Dolores Pradera)12. Untitled - (hidden track)
3,Lunas Rotas was her best,"Although Rosana is indeed a gifted artist, I felt let down by this production. Rosana is Spanish and should perhaps stay within her realm. Her attempt at musica latina left me very frustrated and bored. I wait for another album and hope that this time she remembers her first album."
4,"Fits great and protects your crarpet, but somewhat hard",Pros:Excellent FitLooks greatSturdy and well designedCons:ExpensiveSurface is too hardWe've put these all over our minivan. I can already see they've saved the carpet from lots of winter mud and crud. I'm sure it'll save wear and tear on the van. The units that fit in the trunk and behind the rear seats are definitely worth it. I don't think twice now about putting dirty stuff back there. The design is also exceptional. Every contour of the floor is accounted for. There's no way they will slide anywhere.The only downsides I can see are the price and the surface is quite hard. It's not that comfortable to put your feet on something hard and plastic. You can hear your shoes against it. Carpet or softer rubber would be better for that.
2,Not real suprised it is out of print LOL,It was an ok story not one of the best books in this series. Knight of the black rose would be a better choice.
4,tupac sounda like,"like other people, i've listened to tupac enough to recognise his voice, and like some other people i believe that tupac is not dead. this cd definatly sounds like him, and if you think that it's not tupac because of the picture - think about it. If tupac faked his own death then brought out a new albulm, why would he put a picture of himself on there? then people would know it's tupac, so the purpose of faking his own death is defeated, so it's obvious that he would put a picture of someone else.Also, the name of the album, Res-Sa-Rec-Shun...Resurection...Resurection of tupac."
1,This is definitely not 2Pac.,"2Pac was a real poet. His rhymes were amazing, they were complex, and the topics he chose to talk about were important. Blac Haze on the other hand just talks about weed, hoes, money and how tough he is. Not just that but his style is too elementary to be Pac. So how the hell can anyone mistake this guy for 2Pac? Compare their lyrics and you'll see a huge difference. This guy's an imposter with that album title. If it was really Pac he'd be saying something important, but I have not heard a single important thing on this album.""You know it's funny when it rains it poursThey got money for wars, but can't feed the poor"" - (The Real Tupac Shakur)"
3,who IS this guy?,"i admit that i really like blac haze's music. he has hot beats and good lyrics. hey, ANYTHING that comes outta miami is HOT! (tre+6, trick, jt money, camoflauge, iconz etc)anyway back to this dude named haze. the songs ""do u wanna ride"" ""playa fa life"" and the ""lemme holla atcha rmx"" have the tightest beats. but as for his voice he certainly sounds like the late great pac. most of the titles sound pacalistic except ""i remember mama"" afeni shakur didn't die so this guy must be a carbon copy which in essence would make him a biter. but when i first heard this cat on the ""iconz: street money"" album on that ""lick shots"" song, he didn't sound like pac. and now that he revealed himself (a year after the ""lemme holla atcha"" single cover)he doesn't look like pac at all. plus, MIA - LA? i don't see the connection. anyway, ""the resurection"" gets 3 stars for the beats. NBA = no biters allowed. ya heard me?"
3,definitely tupac,"this rapper is definitely tupac, the cover of the cd might not have his face on it. But blac haze sounds exactly like him, no doubt."
2,2Pac Biter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Even though I do like a couple of his songs he's still a big 2Pac biter. I've read how alot of u know it ain't 2Pac and that he does sound a little like 2Pac, But ya'll only know half the story!!!Blac Haze actually tried to convice people he was 2Pac just to sell more albums. He even wrote a message on the cover of the cd sayin somethin like ""This May be Tupac Shakur or may not, U Decide."" He even had a tombstone in the background that had 2Pac written on it. But Afeni Shakur sued him and the cover was changed.So all ya'll who are sayin he isn't a 2Pac wannabe and the few who actually believe he is 2Pac, Ya'll better check yourselves and stop talkin before u know the facts."
4,It's Tight,"This is a very tight album but me personally he sounds only a l'l bit like pac. i mean really, if u are really a true tupac fan u can tell tha big difference between blac haze and pac. blac haze voice is a l'l bit more mellow then pac, plus he sounds like he from tha south. since pac has dissapered there have been alot of ""pac wannabees"" tryin to hype people up to take there money but if u are a true pac fan u would now there is only one Tupac Shakur!"
3,this is good but tupac was better,I feel this album has good lyrics and Blac Haze has a good voice but feel that it is always second best to Tupac....
5,Love this product!,I have a Topeak Explorer Rear Mount Rack on both my road and off road bikes. I like everything about the system. Just slide the bag up the rails until it clicks in place and push the button when you're ready to slide it back off. (Then slide it on the other bike if that's what I need to do.) I've had the system on both bikes for over a year now and have never had any issue. As a person who HATES to wear any kind of backpack when I ride this system is just the ticket.
2,Does not fit my QR Beam Rack,"This Bag does not fit my QR Beam Rack, therefore I cannot use it. Otherwise it looks like a nice bag."
4,Topeak MTX Trunk Bag,"The trunk bag is execellent. It arrived in very good shape, boxed appropriately and within the committed ship date. Very satisfied and would purchase from the store again."
5,Great bike bag but read below before buying,"This bike bag is used with their bike rack. So you really do need to buy both. What a great idea....a bike rack with a track that this bike bag slides onto. Great design and holds a lot of stuff. I keep my lock, tools, water bottle, sun screen inside. It does the job and more than I expected. Also priced right."
4,Very good bag,This bag is more durable than some others in the topeak line. Looks nice on the bike and the locking system works well.
3,SImple and Predictable - Not Wheeler's Best Work,"If you want a simple, predicable western (sort of) this book is for you. This is not a bad book, but it is far from Wheeler's best work. The characters are thin, predictable and often tiresome. How often does Belle need to remind us that she is a ""gold digger""? How often does Jones need to repeat his reasons for leaving Belle? These scenes are replayed so often that they become tiresome and overall this story was so predictable I wondered if it were written over a weekend. I could go on, but will stop here."
3,Not for betta use,"I had this in my 20 gallon tank and it worked well for about two weeks. Then my female betta got over to the other side of the divider and was beat up pretty bad by my male betta. So, it'll serve its purpose for separating fish, just not ones that can jump."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT,"I just recieved this item and put it together very easy. I am using it to seperate two different types of baby cichlids in my 55 gallon tank. This product does not even touch the walls on side of the tank. The babies can still make it by both sides of the so called seperater. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I think that it should be taken off the market and this company should be taken to court for false advertisement! The only thing this is going to stop from getting to the other side pf your tank is the fish fecies that gets caught on the center of it.DON'T WASTE OR TIME WAITING FOR THIS PRODUCT TO COME IN THE MAIL...BETTER YET DON""T WAIST YOUR MONEY BUYING IT!"
1,Don't waste your money,"The 55 gallon size does not even come close to fitting a 55 gallon tank. I got it to split my male and female guppies, but there is so much space between the side of the divider and the side of the tank that they have no problem swimming back and forth."
3,"Not bad, even for mild mannered bettas, with a bit of modification!","I used this in a 15 gallon tank for moderate tempered bettas and zebra danios (nippy to each other, but mostly would chase). It does a great job of keeping the fish separated, but I found that over the top filtration wasn't quite strong enough to pull waste from the far side of the tank with the tiny, tiny holes. Solution: drill larger holes at the top and bottom, sand the new holes only (those areas will cloud a bit) and rinse. Viola! It works!Everybody is happy and safe in the tank now!I wish they didn't use that god awful blue for the edges, and that the clips didn't get in the way of the hood, but at least my little guys & girls are comfortable."
1,Doesn't do the job and terrible for bettas.,"I got this to divide my 10 gallon tank for my two bettas. First and foremost, the holes in it were way too small. It caused a huge temperature difference in the tank, and kept the filter from working on one side. Secondly, my bettas could see each other and my more aggressive one became very stressed out incredibly fast. Third, it didn't fit right in my tank and somehow it got loose. The next thing I know I have my shy, reserved betta venturing into my very, very aggressive fish's side. I managed to rescue my little guy before he could get anything more than a good chasing. Thankfully, I had a 3 gallon that I set up rather hastily to house my shy boy.This divider didn't work for my tank, and it could have got my betta seriously injured or even killed had I not been home at the time. Save yourself the money and build your own divider."
4,video purchase amazon.com,"totally satisfied with purchase of video with vendor via amazon.com, both price and quality of product"
4,wowwww,"WoW! 10 channels! All began with 1 channel (mono), and then came 2, 4, 5, 6 and at last 7 channel amps. But it is ten! I have not seen nor listened the product, but the one who will buy this product should have a large ... large room for it ;)"
3,Mixed feelings,This album has some GREAT songs on it; sophisticated swing being one of my favorites. However many of the other songs are too operatic and lame. I give three stars but this album is definatly worth it just for some of the better songs.
2,"Not so good, wood breaks and comes unglued","While I give this product props for a clean modern design, I must say that is undone by overall lack of quality. The bamboo is only a paper thin sliver of bamboo that has been glued on the back. My case arrived with the bamboo coming unglued and cracking. From what I see here, this case is not going to hold up, even if it had come in better shape the craftsmanship is very poor. Still though it appears nice from a distance."
5,when concrette gotta go...,"I have worked in a Home Depot tool rental center for a year and a half. we have a number of these concrete/metal saws and rent them to homeowner and contractor alike. these machines never cease to amaze me in terms of reliability and durability. They always start on the second or third pull and still run after all of the times i have rented them out to people that simply abuse the things. They do have an issue with the blade guard cracking, but that is a problem that does not show for a while. Keep those filters clean and they run for a long time. just be sure that you wouldn't be better off renting one before you buy."
2,Power Cut-off saw,"This saw looks like a very good saw, but it is so heavy to handle. I got it started once and my arm was sore for 3 weeks. I am unsure if I will ever be able to use it."
2,I hate this movie but still buying this movie,"I saw this movie long long time ago.I didn't felt disgusting. I have a strong stomach, so.But I hated it.There's no meaning I thought watching this film.But anyway I am purchaging it.You know why?I donno.I know what the pasism and all and can apply to this movie but still don't liked the film.The picture quality is very good although my pirate version was good too.IS it worth buying it? You decide.PS: The picture quality is so so. It was not like sharp enough to say oh, it's HD.The sound is mono one channel."
1,Collecting dust on my shelf,"I bought this book at the Sun Associates booth at a conference and haven't used it since that day. I am by no means advanced in integrating technology, but this book was too elementary, even for me. I did not find the content inspiring and felt that it did not address my needs as a middle school teacher."
3,remember Insurgence?,"I have a demo tape of Aaron's hardcore, Vegan loving band in high school. yet i'm 8 years older than the guy. why? i worked at his high school. we used to sit in his home econ. class and talk about music while my autisic student would yell at people for not like the Power Rangers. aaahhh, good times. then.. here he is. singing?? alright. can't say i really dig this record but i'm happy to see he's moved on from the hardcore bands and he's actually singing. the band are nice enough guys but not much originality here. maverick will chew you up and spit you out... and i am guessing they did. anyhow, aaron at least youre doing it. stop trying to write music for ""everybody"" and write somethng for yourself... maybe you'll discover something a bit more genuine. that being said, this isn't really a bad record and if you like STP and other 90's post grunge bands... you might really like this. plus hey, aaron's my friend and i can't dis the guy."
2,boring,"how many times have we heard this before?""questions"" is a good song but EVERYTHING else sounds like a mellow version of the aforementioned song.it doesnt seem like enough effort was put into this album to sustain it throughout its entirity.not worth your time or your money (""questions"" is only 2:15)."
1,Indistinguishable Crap Rock,"Every once in awhile a waste of recording technology like Home Town Hero comes along and it makes me thankful I have this forum to save people from an unknowing torture they might inflict on themselves. It also makes me thankful I can save them fifteen dollars and forty-five minutes of their life. The album art looked promising enough, the four band members portrait silhouette against varying shades of orange resembling a sunset. HTH's sound is no different than Nickelback, Lifehouse, or The Calling, or any other alt-rock act trying to milk a major record deal for all the exposure it's worth. For what it's worth the singles are ""Questions,"" and ""Eighteen"" which sounds to be a little bit out of Weezer's songbook. Lead singer Aaron Bruno attempts a falsetto on ""Everything's Out Of Water"" and tries to pick up chicks with the ballad, ""Bed Of Dreams."" File under: indistinguishable crap rock."
4,Best opening act I've ever seen,"I had the pleasure of seeing Home Town Hero open for Stone Temple Pilots at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom last April, and I was blown away by HTH's opening set. I normally make myself scarce during the opening band's set for obvious reasons, but I stuck around for HTH and I'm glad I did. This band's got **IT.** Their self-titled debut album is a welcome mix of edgy rock (listen to ""Questions"" and ""Run Right Through"") and sweet ballads (check out ""Everything Out of Water""). I got to meet the guys as well, and they are a lot of fun. You might as well get their album now because they're gonna be around for the long haul. :)"
3,Not what I expected,"My daughter got this doll for Christmas. When I read the review I thought it was going to do so much. She doesn't do what I thought she would. Squeals with delight means, ""squeaks if you squeeze her arm."" I got Baby Annabell and loved her and all her functions. But to my surprise both of my daughters fight over this doll because she uses her potty and they can bathe her. It is there favorite one. For that I would buy another one, but only on sale. It is not worth the money (full price)for what you get. She is cute though."
1,Get A different Doll!,"This doll is just awful--3 year old wanted a ""tear baby"" soooo badly so Santa broguht this for Christmas. He should have saved himself the $40. It is impossible to make it cry. It pees EVERYWHERE! You cannot lay it down without having it wet everything in sight. It only comes with one diaper and you pretty much need to be a weight lifter to squeeze the water out of it's bottle and into the mouth. What a rotten toy!"
1,not worth the money,"I bought this doll for my 7 year old daughter. I feel it was not worth the money at all. My daughter got very frustrated with it. The doll does not sit on the potty correctly, when you give a bottle the water drips out of the mouth, you had to position it a certain way to feed it or even see a tear. It is not a doll for a younger child. You will have to do everything for them. After a week my daughter said this should not be called baby born, it should be called ""Baby Boring"". Save your money, this doll is in the back of the closet."
3,Baby Born Flop,Well My 6 year old who desperately wanted the baby born finally got it but after a week has discarded it into the pile of previous baby dolls. I don't know why really but it was not a winner.
1,Awful,"I've never written a review before this, but I was so dissapointed when I got this doll, I had to write one. I wanted my 2 year old to have a baby that pees on the potty because I thought it may help with potty training. If you want the baby to pee, you have to feed it the bottle while it's sitting on the potty because the water runs right through it. The baby is also hard, not soft and cuddly. As for the other functions, the other reviewers are correct, I haven't seen a tear, or heard a cry yet. Maybe it would be better for an older child. My neighbor's child got Baby Annabell, which seems so much nicer. It's softer, it cries, it burps, etc. I feel I wasted my money."
3,Not worth it,"This doll is no better than the dolls I had when I was a kid back in the seventies. Same concept, put water in her mouth it runs down the inside of her body and comes out a hole in her crotch. The body is very hard, she doesn't do anything by herself. The food kept running back out of her mouth and then it was very disappointing to read that you have to clean her out everytime you feed her. It took 4 bottles of water to make her cry just a little bit. (You have to pump her arm up and down and squeeze it to make her cry - how realistic is that?!) You squeeze her other arm and she makes a squeeky noise. Doesn't sound anything like a baby, sounds like a squeeky toy you'ld buy for a dog. She's not at all what I expected."
3,Doll is great if Mom and Child want to play together!,"My 3 year old daughter got this doll for christmas. I've read some of the other reviews and will admit that this doll is not a doll that can be used by a small child alone. If the child is 7 or older perhaps, but it takes some work and patience to feed, change and clean this doll.Overall it is a sweet doll, I got mine to cry, use the potty etc. And I think it is to be expected that a doll needs to be cleaned out properly after feeding it the special food. I mean you wouldn't want it to get moldy inside would you?I think it is a great educational toy and will teach your child to be caring and patient. Afterall isn't that the point? My 3 year old is still a bit to small, but within the next year I am sure she will enjoy it with my help. Go ahead and buy the doll, just be aware you will have to help your child quiet a bit. If you as the parent don't have a lot of patience then don't bother with it."
3,reading a review,I have not gottin the new baby born but I heard the reviews and it does not seem I want it any more my mom says you should get but after the reviews I seen I think I want a true so real baby doll they look real and feel real and even through what my family said I do not think I want it I am ten years old and it seems diffucult because you have to change it and only comes with ONE DIPPER so if she drinks or lays down you only have one and then YOU GOT TO BUY MORE DIPPERS
3,Child likes it...not sure I do!,"The doll is great to a child, but after paying 40 dollars for a doll, you expect it to not make a cheesy squeeky noisy, be so hard to feed, or to get it to go potty. My daughter keeps asking for help, so not real sure who's baby it is. She really does like it though!"
5,i love them,Well hi my name is stephanie and im writing to you about baby borns.Their very amazing espically if you don't have a lilttle sister or brother they keep you company when your bored .It also shows the way to parent so you say the way your mother treated babies when she had you .all im saying that it is fun so weather you think childish it really is not just have fun with bye
5,5 Star Baby Born!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am 10 years old and i think baby born is a great doll because of all the reviews. i don't got it yet but i'm sure this doll is the best. If it is a dissapointment,(it dout it), I will let you guys know. When i get it I'm going to buy all the accessories i can afford."
1,A bad production!,"Sylvia Plath has got to be one of the more depressing souls imaginable according to this movie. There is some discussion of a previous suicide attempt, but no reasons for her behavior were discussed. One can only assume that she had a bi-polar personality, but perhaps it was something else.There should have been more depth to the characters in the movie.Paltrow went way overboard, in my opinion, in a classic example of overacting in practically every scene. On top of that, the music was so loud most of the time that the dialog could not be heard above the din.A bad production, and a poor screenplay. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,Worth seeing for Gwyneth's performance,"SYLVIA hasn't done well at box offices around the world. I think the reason is that the movie focusses far too much on Sylvia's private life than her poetry. However, that is the angle the scriptwriters decided to take. Keeping that in mind, I give the film credit because Gwyneth Paltrow delivers a stunning performance as the depression-riddled Sylvia Path. I found the movie totally engaging for that reason alone.The film does seem to move at a fast pace, but I think this helps grab the viewer's attention.Overall, I was pleasantly surprised at Sylvia, after tossing the DVD aside for month's in favour of other titles."
2,Unreliable Piece of Junk,"This film is not very good and doesnt give a decent description to the banal writer, Plath, played with unmotivated response by Paltrow. Somehow the director, who is a woman, never chooses to give us passion or even any amount of interest in the topic at hand, the matter of fact presentation is dull and the climax is expected. So she killed herself and, well, the director rolls the credits and nothing is ever satisfied inside the viewer's mind......"
4,Portrayal of Affair with Assia,"The film takes a lot of liberties with the plot exposition of Hughes' affair with Assia. Apparently they did kiss in the kitchen and Plath saw it. Apparently also Assia killed herself and her daughter by Hughes (by gassing) less than 10 years after Plath did. There is a biography of her which does not seem to receive much mention--in it there are exerpts from her diaries which divulge information about Plaths' second novel which was never found, and about her last diaries which of course Hughes destroyed. See http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/09/09/nhughes09.xml"
2,Not enough momentum,"The movie ""Sylvia"" was a case of excellent actors doing the best possible with a ""not excellently paced script""."
3,Expected to be more moved,"I expected to feel more emotion during the film, having read ""Birthday Letters"" and the biography ""Her Husband"" before watching this movie, and having studied Plath in school. The movie seemed...flat. It skipped through the storyline pretty quickly too. First they are newlyweds and ten minutes later they have two kids, sprinting through the years of marriage.I was glad to see a balanced portrayal--Hughes has always been history's villain, but in the movie it is a little more subtle portrayal of a marriage between two passionate, creative people who seemed fated to cause each other pain."
2,They Shouldn't Have Proceeded without the Poetry,"Sylvia Plath is one of the great female poets of all time, in league with Sappho, Emily Dickinson, Elizabeth Bishop, Anne Sexton, and the underrated Louise Gluck. ""Ariel"" may be the finest book of poems by a woman EVER, vivid, dark, trilling, grisly, and gorgeous. That book, her last, is available in a lovely new hardbound with previous drafts and interesting information.Get that, rather than this film, because the filmmakers were barred from quoting very much of her poetry or excerpting lines from her best novel ""The Bell Jar,"" and without her powers of the written word on display, we don't know why a movie about Sylvia Plath would even be made.All we have is a dysfunctional woman succumbing to suicidal depression. Poets' lives are seldom impressive; it's their work we remember! See ""As Night Falls"" for a much better example of a poet bio-pic; it has a far more interesting plot and is soaked in the man's vibrant poetry."
1,Not good,"I agree with all the negative reviews, and think that Paltrow gave a good performance, and I would tell anyone interested in SP to see the film (Don't know if you cd stop them) but I'd say that overall the movie is too long and melodramatic, boring at times, and has no depth. I found myself checking my watch only 30 minutes into it. The other bad thing about this is that the DVD itself sucks. With no extra features, I don't see the point. They could have at least had some commentary or making of stuff, or even a Plath doc on it- but there is nothing at all. I hated ""The Hours""- I thought that was even worse than this, but at least the DVD is better and has more features on Woolf and the writer, etc. I ended up getting ""The Hours"" on DVD even though I hated the film because of the features (I only paid like 6 dollars of course). But overall, bad movie, poorly written, but well acted, nice cinematography and no features on the DVD. What a bunch of lazy bums."
3,Plath lovers wanted more!,"Although I thought Paltrow did a good job as Plath, I still felt this movie could have been so much more.After all, Plath was so much more.I did like the way Hughes was portrayed though...not just as the man who did Sylvia wrong, but as one who contributed, along with other circumstances, to her depression.As one who knows a tremendous amount about Plath, I was expecting pure poetry, but instead I got, a pathetic woman crying, screaming and dying throughout the movie.Plath was so much more, her poetry was so much more.She deserved something exquisite...Because she was exquisite.And fun...when the devil was not crouching behind her ear, when she was not freezing her ass off in Great Britain, when she was writing in her journal.Anyone would hate her after seeing this movie...My suggestion---buy her journals. Completely superb!"
4,BRAVO Gwyneth!,"This film is NOT what I expected! I expected a fantastic film with fantastic performances/stars. Well, the movie sucked. But the actors were wonderful! Especially Gwyneth. The scenes with her real-life mom, Ms. Danner, were intriguing.If you are a Gwyneth Paltrow fan, you'll enjoy this film. Otherwise, skip it."
3,"good pictures, bad plot","I gave this film three stars because it is visually pretty stunning. It recreates 50's England beautifully, and captures the isolation of young motherhood very well. I disagree with most reviewers, however, as regards Gwyneth Paltrow's acting. I just don't see her doing any. She is simply being Gwyneth Paltrow, a little strung out. Her Sylvia is glamorous, willowy, beautiful in a contemporary way that the real Plath was not. The film constantly changes facts slightly to support this portrayal. In real life, for instance, Plath and her children were staying with friends until the night before her suicide. The film shows her calling people frantically asking if she can come around and visit and being turned down. I guess the image of lovely Gwyneth crying in a phone booth is more arresting than that of Sylvia Plath surrounded by concerned friends, which she was. Read a biography if you want to know about her."
2,Flat portrait of Sylvia Plath,"I was really looking forward to seeing a movie about the life and death of the famous Sylvia Plath, but I found this movie to be ultimately unsatisfying. I guess one major problem I have with it is that it does not show her life in New York City which ultimately became the basis for THE BELL JAR, her most compelling work. Although I liked the reading of her poems throughout the movie, the focus on her life with Ted Hughes I didn't like. Ted Hughes was the last influence in her life; she had many major influences before she met him."
3,"THIS MOVIE TURNED ME INTO PALTROW FAN , GREAT.","if you like a good tear jerker,this movie is for you, its well- written,good acting. this film is very underrated. worth watching"
2,Big Let Down,"I was really looking forward to the release of Sylvia, after having read the Bell Jar and Rough Magic, the biography of her life. After I watched the dvd I was very disappointed. They never really focused on her childhood, which I felt was a big part of what led to her mental illness and eventually her suicide. I was left feeling that something was missing. I know Sylvia Plath's family didn't give permission for the film to use any of her poetry, which kept people from knowing what a gifted and talented poet and writer she was. A really sad portray of her life."
5,best toy,My son got this for Christmas when he was 19 months old. He loves it. It is the best. I would highly recomend this to anyone. Hours of fun!
4,It's a very expensive battery...,It's a battery - don't expect anything more or less from it. Seems to hold a charge and works as expected.
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,"DOES NOT GIVE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF HOURS ADVERTISED. AS FAR AS THE FEATURE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO ALLOW YOU TO PRESS ""THE AMOUNT OF TIME LEFT"", THIS DOES NOT WORK!"
3,"Good for background music, but also worth examining, as it is lovely.","There is an exceptional track in this--""The Mural"". Otherwise, just a very dreamy soundtrack with splashes of reality here and there. A wonderful movie, too. Somewhat Elfman-esque, with the dreaminess of the main theme and the use of voices. The tracks are short, and are by turn funny or whimsical."
5,Must read!,"I am through with the book yet, however it will give you a second thought to our preconceived ideals of what we think to be heaven."
4,GOOD BOOK,"THIS BOOK WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED. I WANTED THE FULL SIZE BOOK ,BUT IT WAS MY FAULT. I WILL PAY MORE ATTENTION NEXT TIME I ORDER."
3,"Heaven (Alcorn, Randy)",Randys arguments could have been better substantiated in the book. mediocre... he thinks he is a scholar but the arguments seem circular.
1,So Repetitive!,I read this book from cover to cover because it was given to me by a good friend. It is not just because I don't believe what Mr. Alcorn says that I am giving HEAVEN such a low rating. It is because the author says everything over and over and over. This book could have been written in 100 pages instead of the nearly 500 pages it took.
1,BORING!,"Don't bother with this book - and I've read other Randy Alcorn books that I've liked. This book is 500 pages and could have been 100 - it is extremely redundant. Much of the content is either speculative or insignificant - i.e., Will We Tell Stories in Heaven or How Will Humans and Animals Relate in Heaven? It's not worth your time or money."
4,A Great Gift,I bought this as a gift for my mother. She really likes the way the author described Heaven. She never looked at Heaven in this way before.
5,Heaven study book.,"This has been an ""eye opening"" study about what scripture reveals to us about heaven. I have ordered approximately 8 books for our Bible study and every week someone else is interested in purchasing one. Truly a life changing book."
5,Best book on Heaven I've seen,"Mr. Alcorn ties in all his observations about Heaven to specific scriptures, refuting many of the most common preconceptions we have. Very good reasoning about why we should be looking forward with great anticipation to being in God's presents in Heaven."
5,Priceless,"Oh yes, this book is a wonderful read from a man that has obviously researched the word of God, and gleaned from it the insight and revelations of what God has waiting for the one that makes it into eternal life. It certainly makes sense to me.Religion has failed to search these things out and I believe that Randy Alcorn's timing of ""Heaven"" is ""Divine Providence,"" since we are very close to the end of this dispensation, and will soon ""see for ourselves."""
1,Heaven DVD,Disappointing DVD. The subject matter is relevant to his book but it is short and poorly produced. Mostly the DVD sells his other products in his series on Heaven.
5,Heaven...An outstanding effort by Randy Alcorn to explain a supernatural place that's out of this World!,This is the kind of study that needs to be available to everyone at every level in life. Particularly those that fear death...which at some point includes everyone.Randy Alcorn and his associates did a wonderful job in developing this study.I would and have recommended this book to many of my friends.
5,Comfort after my husband's death,"""Heaven"" by Randy Alcorn has changed my life. My husband died a year ago and although we are both Christians, I wondered about just where he was and how we would be reunited one day. This book has given me a lot of comfort and happiness by learning more about the heaven God will have for us, right here on this earth! Churches are not teaching much about heaven but the book fills in that void. It is based on sound Biblical teaching and is so interesting as well as informative. Now I have a real vision of what eternal life is like, and how wonderful it is. Praise God for all His goodness.Susan C."
5,Revis of the book Heaven,This is a good book with a lot of information that we as Christians want about our home that is coming
5,Heaven by Randy C. Alcorn,This is the best book on the subject of Heaven and what we will find and experiece when we get there. I found it to be so informative and comforting that instead of flowers I gave this book to two different friends when they lost a close family member. Both of them found it to be a source of comfort for them. We intend to do this in the future and give the book to other friends.
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book about the topic of Heaven. It answers any questions you have and many you have never thought of! It goes into detail about many aspects of Heaven that most people do not even know will be there. For anyone who is interested in knowing more about Heaven and what it will be like, this book is great."
1,had to quit reading this,"I guess the narrow view is too much for me. Although it sounds logical as written (especially because scripture is often quoted as proof), one must assume that his biblical interpretations (and, indeed, that Christianity is the only way to go) are accurate. In some cases, the interpretations are at best arguable (which means the conclusions are as well). If you like considering a very different opinion than what is traditionally taught, this will be a fascinating book. And for me, it was indeed fascinating until it became clear that the more assumptions (and conclusions) that were made, the bigger house of cards this became. And while I am not at all a traditionalist (i.e. just because it is tradition does not mean it is right), and while I enjoyed the head scratching this caused me, I just could not go the next step and believe all this. Oh well. It was a good exercise anyway."
5,I can't wait to get to Heaven,Randy Alcorn challelnges popular notions of heaven in thought provoking yet easy to understand style without sacrificing scholarly integrity. He cites numerous scripture passages as well as Biblical scholars to support his thesis and lays out a much richer and more interesting eternity than most of us have ever imagined. I highly recommend this book. It will provoke interesting discussions and force you to closely examine your notion of heaven.
4,this has nothing to do with the book-I got it for my wife who had read it and wanted a personal copy.,nothing additional to say this just forces people to write drivel and not be productive. I will just not respond in the future
5,Heaven,"I believe that this book should be read by everyone who believes that there is and will be a Heaven. I also believe that this book should be read by those who doubt or down-right disbelieve that there is a heaven after the Judgement day. If you are in this later group, beware, because Jesus is going to change YOUR life."
3,Heaven,"You really need to be ready for this one. We studied it in our Sunday School class, but ended up just looking at scriptures and studying all of the views on the end times."
3,Interesting But Not Great,"Provides some good insights as to what Heaven might potentially be, but devolves into what is mostly speculation. I suppose that other than what we know from the Bible, that is about all anyone can do. I had hoped for better insights, but find that the speculation that heaven will ultimately be much like the earth we now inhabit, and that we will remember all that went on on earth, is not the most inspiring message to hear."
1,It'll do until I get there,"Thank you, Randy Alcorn. I think you've taken a loving, honest, shot at describing Heaven.Fortunately, it's actually much better than you think.Shalom"
2,Heaven,"I would like to say that I am happy with the product order through Amazon. However, when I received the book that said it was ""like new"", I found that a half page was cut out in the middle of the book. Frankly, I am not happy with this. Is there some way that Amazon can fix this issue? I would like to read the book, but the page missing interrups the subject matter. I do not know who this book belonged to, but they should have been forthcoming about the page being cut out before they sold the book. I would appreciate a response back to this comment. This is the first time this has ever happened and I am not happy about it.Thank you,Dawn Higgins"
1,DEPRESSING,"I APPARENTLY AM IN THE MINORITY IN MY IMPRESSIONS OF THIS BOOK. I FELT LIKE A CHILD THAT WAS TOLD HOW WONDERFUL DISNEY WORLD WAS, BUT THEN TOLD I WOULD NEVER GET TO GO. I WAS DEPRESSED FOR THREE DAYS AFTER READING THE FIRST SEVERAL CHAPTERS, AND THEN JUST QUIT READING. HIS CONTENTION THAT VERY FEW OF US ARE WORTHY AND THAT THE KIND OF LIFE WE HAVE LIVED WILL MAKE NO DIFFERENCE WHERE WE END UP, MADE WE WONDER WHY ANY AVERAGE HUMAN BEING WOULD DO ANYTHING GOOD BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO HELL ANYWAY. I'M OBVIOUSLY NOT A ""BIBLE THUMPER"", BUT I DO BELIEVE IN GOD AND JESUS CHRIST AND TRY TO LIVE A RIGHTOUS LIFE, BUT AFTER READING THE FEW CHAPTERS I READ, I JUST REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT THE GOD I BELIEVE IN IS AS PUNITIVE AS THE ONE THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES IN HIS BOOK. I DON'T BELIEVE GOD SENDS US TO HELL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T DOT ALL THE I'S AND CROSS ALL THE T'S IN LIFE. WE ARE ALL HUMAN AND MAKE MISTAKES, BUT FEW OF THEM ARE SERIOUS ENOUGH TO WARRENT ETERNAL DAMNATION. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,"Heaven, by Randy Alcorn","Highly recommend this well researched investigation of what the Bible has to say about Heaven. Much is extrapulation and conjecture, but the author's views are explained thoroughly. Very uplifting, even life-changing."
4,Looking Forward To Heaven,"This is a good overall book on Heaven, and what we can expect life to be like there. I'm looking forward to seeing my loved ones again someday. There are 2 chapters on animals, however, I recommend THERE IS ETERNAL LIFE FOR ANIMALS by Niki Behrikis Shanahan for a very detailed Bible-based book which proves through Scripture that all animals going to heaven."
2,Good & Bad,"Lots of good information but so disjointed and repetitive as to be almost intolerable reading. Also very definitive about minor things while being a bit vague about some major things? For a better organized book about heaven, try Erwin Lutzer..."
4,Redundant But Very Insightful,"This is a great book on heaven! It is very comprehensive and touches on many aspects I had never thought of before. It does get a little repetitive. Overall though, it has helped me to see that I was designed for heaven, I put too much emphasis on this life, and I will never be completely satisfited until heaven."
5,"Heaven: you'll want to read this; and. after reading it, want to immediately go!","Well-written, well-researched, and scriptural-sound book. Randy discusses the realities and myths of heaven in a thoughtful, reasoned, and informative way. After reading this book, your faith will be strengthened, your knowledge of heaven will be expanded, and, frankly, you'll look forward to going!"
5,Hard to put down... delightful to pick up.,"I bought this because a friend recommended it, now I know why... this book has unveiled the delight I used to have as a kid when thinking about heaven and answers questions I had as an adult. Finally, someone thought it through and got it right!"
2,Too Literal,"Well written and easy to read, but many ""assumptions"" made. Makes God way too small. Takes away God's unique mystery."
5,love this book,Love this book and recommend Heaven book to gain an understanding of what we have to look forward to in Heaven!
4,Heaven,"Interesting, reveals a different approach to understanding the Bible. I would recommend this book as study guide, but not a replacement for God's word."
3,Heaven,It is hard to review thos book when I have not received it on my Kindle. It said it was not out in kindle form yet. If it is out how do I get it?
5,Wonderful experience!,"The service was wonderful and the book was perfect even though it was to be ""like new"". Thanks for your speedy shipment!"
5,Awesome book,"I've studied the book of Revelation two times in the past 30 months, and the book Heaven, puts a bright light on the next life, on the New Earth. Love reading it."
4,Interesting Read,"This book is a good read and did help explain some bible verses in better detail. A pastor had spoke of reading this book and had gotten me interested in read it. There were too many references to other books that were written and I basically skimmed over these parts because I wanted to read the authors perspective, not what 15 other people have written in their books and what their opinions were. It does make you appreciate this life more and look forward to Heaven. Although, no one can know for sure what heaven will be like until we get there, we can be assured that it will be a better place without illness, pain, suffering, and regret. God loves us and sent his son to pay for our sins."
3,Great read,"This was a great book to read. I enjoyed it, so much so that I bought 3 more copies for Christmas presents."
3,A Good Start Start Start,"Alcorn does get off to a good start, clearly demonstrating from the Scriptures that Heaven does not involve sitting around on clouds while playing harps. He then addresses other cultural misperceptions. Most of the book is spent getting sidetracked into minutae which he reiterates ad nauseum. This is a good 100 page book on Heaven that is 400 pages too long."
4,What a nice change of pace.,"A good product. Very tasty. It's also very spicy, despite the fact that it's labelled as being ""Mild"". But unless you really can't stand spicy foods you should enjoy this product. I couldn't taste the coconut at all, and that's the reason I picked this particular flavor but after I had cooked it all up and eaten it I wasn't disappointed much.I would recommend thining this with water (maybe a cup per full jar) as it is, like I say, a bit spicy. The thinned product also went well over a bed of rice.I used this sauce with chicken and frozen 'stir-fry' veggies; sauteed and then simmered while the rice cooked.This product makes a nice change from the usual lunch or dinner dishes. I will try other Pataks flavors in the future (although I prefer Chef Shaikh's curry sauce to Pataks)."
1,Important info not mentioned in product details,"This player is useless if you own a Macintosh. You need the ""safely remove hardware"" wizard in Windows to modify the charging status. Even if you purchase a power adapter (sold separately) you will not be able to use the software for your player.Also, the buttons are too small for practical use, and look cheaply made. Overall the player looks like a children's cell phone."
4,I love hello kitty!,"OK the only reason I got this is because I love Hello Kitty. There is no such thing as a bad HK product in my eyes. Just so you know it fits the full size iPod player and not the nano, or mini."
3,This Peter Green is American; he's not the English bluesman.,"This Xmas album is straightforward Texas-style blues: Gatemouth Brown, Albert Collins, more-Stevie-Ray-than-Jimmie Vaughan (and more's the pity). The singing is kinda throaty and sincere. Nothing exceptional--or distracting, for that matter.Except for the name. If Jeff Buckley was doomed to be his father's son, at least his name was different. Mr. Green's ""public"" commitment to his name may be admirable, but it strikes me as hardly short of perverse to challenge legend by publicly appearing with the same name as the Peter Green of blues and rock history. Ironically, the latter's real name is Peter Greenbaum! But what the American may get in terms of integrity seems to be at the cost of much confusion."
5,Perfection for those longing for subtlety in singing,"Anyone who has heard Jessica Molaskey's singing in ""Songs for a New World"" or the recently closed ""A Man of No Importance"" (CD due in April) knows she can belt with the best of them. Yet for this recording she offers a restrained, subtle take on a collection of classic tunes from the Depression (and two new songs). Those of us who are tired of American Idol-style histrionics overshadowing any semblance of melody should delight in Ms. Molaskey's interpretations of these songs. She offers spare, elegant renditions of each - every one of today's young ""singers"" should be forced to listen, and take notes."
2,What the....?,"Did I hear the same disc? Very cutsie-pie vocals over OK backing. Unnatural ""earnest"" sound gets tiresome real quick. Make sure you listen to the samples before you buy."
2,It's alright I guess,"I bought this based on the fact that she's John Pizzarelli's wife - which sounded very promising.Unfortunately, & maybe unfairly, I was hoping for a Pizzarelli-like jazzy performance. This cd is ok - just ok.It's a little too Broadwayish at times, it's a little too sleep-inducing the other times - yawn. Her voice is alright, nothing too memorable though - there's definitely better singers out there.Overall I found it very unenthusing - maybe I was in a wrong mood at the time. This is NOT the female version of John Pizzarelli in case you were wondering; however John does show up on 'We're in the Money'. Sadly though, this cd's just not worth the Money."
1,A set for kids,"Xacto makes great blades and marking knives so I felt pretty confident I'd get good value for an affordable price. I was wrong. This set is for children, not comfortable to grip and the tips were dull."
1,"Xacto Wood Carving tools, not worth purchasing","Years ago I bought a set of wood carving tools to use for fairly complex and exacting woodcarving/pattern making; I loved the tools. Recently I decided to return to wood carving and decided I wanted a set similar to the old ones I was used to. Save your money and don't buy these. The tools themselves were disappointing, They were obviously very cheaply made and the edge they came with was clearly something I would have to work hours on to get a mediocre edge at best. I love Amazon as I returned these without any hassle. I almost never return anything, but these were junk. My recommendation is to spend a bit more and buy something with quality. These tools will give anyone nothing but trouble."
1,Really bad carving chisels,"Just wanted to say that these chisels are junk. I pity someone who develops an interest in wood carving and starts out with this set. They are very poorly ground and as far as I can tell they are made of poor quality metal. I am a seasoned wood carver that can never have too many chisels and gouges. I thought if they were ground poorly, I could regrind them to make tools for special applications. However, the metal is soft, so there is no good reason to do anything with them. Compared to well known carving tools (Swiss Made, old Buck Brothers, etc.) and these are far softer. I question if they are hardened at all. New wood carvers would be far better off with one decent quality chisel than a whole set of these.Disclaimer: I bought these from a seller on eBay for almost nothing, so I should not complain too much. However, I am writing this review to prevent people from being discouraged with wood carving."
3,"Great Show, Terrible Video","As usual, Sarah Brightman's performance and the quality of the Harem production are top-notch. However, the video quality of the DVD is absolutely terrible. Video noise is noticeable throughout. Compare this to the La Luna DVD and you will see what I mean. It's really a shame, because this incredible show deserves better. Still, this DVD is a must for any Sarah Brightman fan."
3,Fabu minus one thing...,"I am a HUGE Sarah Brightman fan and was so excited when this arrived, but... the only thing I don't like about this video is the lighting and I may have to return it. Very distracting. Yellows, oranges, purples, etc. I get why they are doing it. Ties in with the whole Middle Eastern thing...and it IS Vegas, but it's really annoying. It's not throughout the entire video. There are a few parts where it's ""normal"" stage lighting, but overall I'm not sure I can get past the crazy colors they have going on. I just want see beautiful Sarah Brightman in all her fabulousness and not with an orangey/purpley/redish glow."
5,Sarah has done it again!,"This dvd is my favorite so far out of all her dvd's. I love this concert so much that I saw it twice. So much hard work was put into this concert and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. Now I can relive the concert by watching this dvd. Sarah is so beautiful and sings flawlessly. And in response to a few comments, SHE IS NOT LIP-SYNCHING! Sarah unlike many other artists, actually sings at her concerts which is rare nowadays. The Harem World Tour is the most beautiful and elaborate performance I've ever seen. When I saw this show in Oakland, one of the backstage arena workers said he hadn't seen such a well-put together and beautiful performance in over two years. This dvd will take you into another world, a middle-eastern fantasy. Even just the opening song 'Karma Sutra' sets the mood for the concert. This dvd is worth every single penny and is a wonderful keepsake and addition to any Sarah collection. Go buy this now! You won't be dissappointed!"
3,This great preformance deserves much better video,"A fantastic performance recorded with an outstanding 5.1 audio track. but the video is very poor, even when played through one of the finest DVD players made and watched on a 50"" Pioneer Elite plasma screen. Im a big Sarah Brightman fan but, if they can, the video portion of this program needs to be cleaned up. if the video was up to modern standards I would have given this disc 5 plus stars."
3,Lots of Sizzle - Not Much Steak,"Her other concerts on DVD are far superior to this over splashed production. The picture quality is not very good in spots and sometimes appears to be deliberately ""softened"" for an effect I don't understand.Sarah is lovely and puts out a real effort but there is way too much glitz around her in this."
1,Lip-synched again?,"I was so very much disappointed with her previous dvd album ""One Night in Eden"" because it was lip-synched and I couldn't feel any real concert feel. I also heard ""La Luna"" was lip-synched too. She is the queen of lip-synch or what? I really want to buy a real concert dvd of hers. Can anyone post a review indicating if this was lip-synched or not? Btw, I give one star based on her great work of lip-synching given to her previous concerts."
4,wonderful like ever,If you like Sarah B. you must have this dvd.Our family enjoy very much to watch this show.
4,Great audio...poor video,"I've been a Brightman fan for some time now and I was excited to buy her performance on DVD. I have nothing but good things to say about Brightman's show in LV, but I have nothing but bad things to say about the video quality of the DVD. My home theater display is a 32"" LCD TV (1366x768) and this DVD looks very grainy running 480P even with progressive scan. The DVD was less grainy on my 34"" CRT but the output still looked less than VHS quality. Maybe I should just keep my TV off and just enjoy the music from my home theater speakers..."
5,Damn that was good,"That DVD was so good that there are just no words to describe it. The only fault was that it contained some of the worst songs from the Eden CD, the ones that sound like opera"
2,Great concert ruined by poor video quality,"This was a fantastic performance by Brightman, with terrific stage setup, danceing, etc. The audio was great. Unfortunately the experience was quickly ruined by the horrendous image quality, or rather, the lack of it. There was so much noise in the video that I had to double check with a different DVD player/TV. The image quality was on par with VHS tape at best. Definitely a rushed job and a huge disappointment. Just get the CD."
3,Seen Better By Her,I have seen better concert DVD's of Sarah Brightman. This one left me a little empty. Did not care for the stage presentation. This is only my opinon; you may like it.
1,snowy,"The music and show were very good but the whole picture was ""SNOWY or GRAINY"" - poor quality DVD.I tried the DVD on both my DVD recorders with the same poor result. It has stopped me from buying more of her DVD's.I saw a similar show from Sarah in Las Vegas on the TV and that whole show was clear in sound and vision."
4,Saw Sarah Perform last night in New Orleans,"I had 6th row floor seats last night to Sarah Brightman's concert in New Orleans. I was pleased with her vocals. I detected that she may have lip synched a couple of songs. In certain songs, the instrumentation and vocals sounded eerily similar to the album tracks. Yet other songs, like Nessun Dorma, which I was the first one to stand up to start the standing ovation, seemed live. Overall, I was pleased with her performance and had a nice 2 hours. However, this entire experience cost me over $150, and I was a bit disappointed to see her lip synching to a few of the songs."
2,Pass this one up,"This DVD is awful in terms of video quality. In true Las Vegas fashion, her show had a very dark stage and was continuously pumped full of smoke. The result? Video that is filled with ""noise"" and without detail. You have to go back to the early 1980's to equal this quality of video.Poor Sarah, a beautiful women, had her face heavily made up around the eyes, to the point of looking like a freak in most scenes. Frightening to look at. Her DVD cover is not part of the show. They wouldn't dare!The audio is okay but use it as background music vs. sitting there trying to view this DVD.If you want to see Sarah in full brilliance, then purchase Andrea Bocelli's Live in Tuscany (Blu-Ray). Then you'll see the classy Sarah and not a circus clown.It's obvious that Sarah allowed the Las Vegas ""handlers"" to ""make her up"" to suit the LV crowd. Too bad."
2,Author Recently Changed His Mind On Cycle,"As he detailed in a 4/14/02 posting at the Longwaves forum (thru Colorado State U., beartopia dot com has the link) author Alexander has changed his mind since publishing this book and now feels we are in the fall to plateau and primary recession. Thus, Alexander is of the opinion we have further to drop in the stock market. Reminds me of Elliot Wave theorists who cannot agree among themselves where the current American economy is among the various waves.This book does a good job of detailing why the stock market boom days are over for many years to come."
2,Mind numbing,The author goes on and on detailing the past but drew no sound conclusions. Left me wishing he would just make his point. This book was a tedious read.
3,not universal,"this product is not even close to being universal,will only attatch to certain kinds of burners (those w/ flanges), if youare handy, have the tool's you can adapt this thing to fit,but you shouldnt have to do that.it does work well if you can get it mounted properly"
2,almost-fits,"This igniter is a generic replacement that almost fits but it takes some finagling. The original was a much better product, in fact I had to use the original red button because the new one didn't work.Char-Broil did not have the exact same igniter assembly as was originally equipped with."
1,Junk,"This product claims to be universal??? They don't even deserve a star but amazon makes you add one to submit the review. I guess they forgot that one upon a time they manufactured quality products in the United States of American. This product doesn't fit this model grill. If I were to adapt it I would definitely melt and arch the electrode.I just completed a a frame-off restoration of Charbroil FlameMaster 6000 series grill. The reason I did it was because the cast iron hood has a Made in the USA symbol 4""x 2"" in size. I couldn't bare to throw it out. With amazon I was able to purchase the necessary parts to convert it to the current propane tank fittings. The only part I was unable to find was Sunbeam Gas Grill Replacement Brass Manifold Valve 34100. A simple google search will identify dealers."
4,Good if you are looking for information on SI,This book is my first book on SI and I found it a really informative and helpful. While there are some discussions that may be graffic to some but maybe not all. Over all I found the book insightful and while the stories in the book were different then mine the book was still worthwhile.
2,Not that much helpful,"I expected it to be helpful for my research paper, but it wasn't. I am not saying that it is a bad book, but it not what I wanted to purchase."
3,Get a local lawyer,"Steroids are drugs like any other. If you get in trouble, you are far better off with a local lawyer. Rick has made a fortune by catering to this niche, and while this book DOES tell you all the specifics about steroid law, you can find that info for free online. It kills me when people hire this guy, fly him across the country, and expect he can do something that their local lawyer cannot. Rick doesnt even win his cases.This book is good for basic info, but it doesnt tell you anything you cant find out on your own, for free, online."
5,Cusisinart 726-38H Chefs Classic Stainless 14 in WOK,"Bought as a Chrtistmas gift, such a good value I bought a second one for myslef, used it and love it no more non-stick for me and it cleans up great."
5,Wonderful Wok,"I have purchased 3 of these woks now, 2 as Christmas gifts, and the last in for my home. It is nice sized, washes up wonderfully, and looks a real treat on the cook top. Asring dinner. a rivegan, I use a wok often in prepa"
5,flushing,The cuisinart chef's classic stainless 14 inch stir-fry pan with helper handle and glass cover is very beautiful. Uesful. I like it
5,Great wok pan!,Love this wok pan - our other pan was always rusty and this one cleans great. Clear lid lets you see how things are cooking/burning. Great price and they shipped it super fast.
3,A sticky cooker,"Quality of this cooker is good. However, it is very sticky when cooking chinese dishes, which will use oil to fry rice/meat/vegetables.It is understandable that a stainless cooker will be sticky, however, I believe this cooker is more sticky than average."
1,pitted first time,This product pitted the first time and it is not all clad. Purchased a Tramantina from walmart. Best stuff next to the highly expensive all clad. But the cuisinart chef's classic went back the next day...not good at all.
4,good product but glass lid?,"A nice product at an affordable price. I purchased this to go along with a 10 piece setCuisinart 77-10 Chef's Classic Stainless-Steel 10-Piece Cookware Setand some other pieces from Cuisinart's Classic Collection for a Christmas present for my wife. I even fabricated a matching pot rack system for her kitchen to go along with it. My only peeve is that it came with a glass lid instead of a stainless steel lid. All of the rest of the Classic Collection line has SS lids, so why does this come with glass. They have another line that comes w/ glass lids so it should be labeled as part of that line. My suggestion to Cuisinart is to relabel this as part of that line and offer this wok w/ a SS lid labeled as part of the Classic Collection line."
5,it is a very fine piece of kitchen equipment being stainless steel it will last a long time,"I ENJOY THE STAINLESS STEEL WOK I PURCHASED FROM AMAZON. COM. IT WILL LAST A LONG TIME AND I CAN CLEAN IT OUT WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT SCRAPING ANYTHING OUT LIKE TEFLON. WHEN I COOK IN IT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT CHEMICALS GETTING INTO MY FOOD, WHICH IS WHY I BOUGHT IT. IT IS A VERY FINE WOK. THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD PRICE."
1,DO Not Buy if You Like to Cook,"This pan is not like any of my older stainless steel cook wear which is still very nice. This one burns food quickly and is a pain to clean. The lid is extremely heavy...much heavier than the pan itself. I used this twice and really can't bring myself to cook with it again.I think, Cuisinart, which was considered top of the line, is making a cheap product.Shame on them."
2,It produces a lot of smoke,"I purchased this one as it's huge! I do need a big fry wok, but it's sticky and makes a lot of smoke which is so upset! I think I am going to buy a iron cast one instead."
1,Will Not work on Induction!,"Beware--This is not an induction pan. The description leaves out whether it is or is not--I assumed since it was stainless steel, that it was induction ready. I was wrong--it is in the regifting box. Lesson learned."
1,Warning!!,"FYI Warning!!! If you are purchasing this Wok with the intention of adding it to your induction cookware, please do not.Even tho it is purported to be stainless steel, it will not function on an induction cook top. Thank goodness Amazon'sreturn policy is the greatest on the net."
1,I did not like that it is very light whige and food stick,"I choose this wok because it made of stainlessBut because the wok is so light the food stick and it is very hard to clean.i gave up and got the Gourmet standard stainless 14""wok and i love it.Very easy to clean and easy to cook. this is the only stainless wok that i found in a reasonable price.Gourmet Standard 13 Inch Tri-Ply Wok with Rack and Domed Lid"
2,Doesn't distribute heat very well,"It seems this wok tends to burn a bit up the sides over high heat cooking. However, it seems to be of decent quality and is priced right. Clean up? Good. Just not a great heat conductor or heat distributor. Would I buy again? No. I typically use a non-stick 14"" Circulon Wok which is a much better heat conductor / distributor than the Cuisinart. The nice thing is I bought the two woks together and the cuisinart lid fits the circulon wok![...]***UPDATE*** 11/19/09- If you want a GREAT authentic Wok search on the ""wok shop"" here on the amazon site. Bought one a couple months ago and it is blowing my mind...Soooo awesome...."
4,good quality,"great construction, even heat distribution, has many uses in the kitchen. high recommendation. i use the pan all the time"
4,was a gift,Gave as a gift to my son and daughter (one each-) and my daughter was very pleased and said it made great asian chicken.
4,good item at a great price,"This wok is pretty good... the quality is very good, the lid does what a lid is supposed to do, and it heats very quickly.The down side is that the handle is a little too small for such a big wok, it loses heat very quickly (even for a stainless item), an the bottom is too flat. Traditional woks have a round bottom which make them much more useful for manipulating sauces (pool the sauce in the middle to separate from the meat and veggies) and for deep frying. I realize that round bottoms don't fare well on American cook tops, but even a little more roundness would have gone a long way.However, I got this for thirty three dollars which more than makes up for the shortcomings."
1,Not recommended for hardcore Chinese cooking,"I bought this product b/c of it's specific selling feature for stir fry, which most people will think of Chinese cooking with high heat. I'm happy with the size and shape, but very disappointed w/ material. They meant it when they say the flat bottom part is special heat endurable, b/c it is the only part that endures chinese cooking kind of heat. The edge of the bottom and the surrounding area where the food may touch during the stir dot not endure much heat. It turned brown within 1 min with high heat, then turn even darker if continued. Dish washer scrub wash still cannot remove those burn mark. Scrub by hand took me forever. It also makes a weird ""clink clink"" sound when heated up. The helper handle also got heated up big time, and make it impossible to hold onto when trying to scoop the foot out."
1,Does NOT work with Induction,"I came across this stirfry pan and saw that Amazon was advertising it to accompany theCuisinart MCP-12 MultiClad Pro Stainless Steel 12-Piece Cookware Setwhich I own and enjoy. I bought this item for my husband as a Christmas gift, and fortunately took it out of the box when it came to make sure it worked with our induction range.It DOES NOT work with induction. In the video review that Amazon posted above, it appears that she is in a test kitchen with an induction range and a gas range side by side, but it must be a ceramic cooktop?Also, unlike the MultiClad Pro set, this stirfry pan is not all one piece. The bottom plate is a separate piece from the rest of the pan which I guess is what the demo woman in the video means by ""encapsulated bottom."" Very disappointing. Amazon should update their suggestions so as not to mislead consumers into thinking this is at all like the MultiClad series. I should have done more research on Cuisinart's website prior to purchase."
1,Take off market now,I rarely write reviews for amazon products. They are almost always great products. This Stir-Fry pan comes with a large glass cover. The very first time I used it the cover broke into hundreds of pieces of broken glass. It made a loud popping sound several seconds after I set it down on the counter. It was tempered glass so it left small glass pieces all over my counter top. I just hope none of the glass made it back into the food. The cover was just resting on the counter at least twelve inches from the food. Then it broke and shattered. This product is dangerous. Don't buy it !
1,Does not work on induction - stainless is supposed to,"Stainless pans work on induction cooktops - but this one doesn't. It's listed as stainless, but nothing happens. If you're thinking of buying this for your induction stove, don't bother. Oh, and Cuisinart's customer service line is no longer free - it costs 1.99 per call."
5,Wow its Big,This is a big item. I guess I did not look at that when I picked it out. On the plus side it works like a dream and the plus side of the size is that it hold lots.
5,Perfect work pan,"I had a cheap wok pan that I had used for years and after having some great experiences with Cuisinart cookware, I purchased this piece. I made the most amazing stir fry and the pan was so easy to clean. This was the perfect addition to my kitchen!"
5,EXACTLY WHAT MY DAUGHTER WANTED,I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW IT COOKS BUT IT IS BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED AND THE PERFECT SIZE. IT EVEN COMES WITH A LID.
2,Sticky and really biiiiiig,"the pan is really sticky, and I abandoned it after my first time try...........................Not recommended for future buyers if you are not looking for sticky pan"
3,Deceptive Price--Again,"This is not a product review, per se, but a caution about Amazon's price claims. The pan itself is fine: distributes heat evenly to sear food well, cleans easily, has good weight, etc. That said, buyers should be aware that Cuisinart recommends a retail price of $34.95 for this pan. So while Amazon offers a savings, it is not a discount from a retail price of $100, which Amazon suggests. I am finding more and more incidents of this type of deceptive pricing on Amazon--very disappointing and totally unnecessary. Everyone should check other websites before buying here to make sure the savings and expected quality are legitimate."
1,Bought 3...all are pitting after 4 uses,"I teach cooking classes and I love to use stainless steel pans because they clean up so nicely and are healthier for the environment and my clients. I bought these for a large team building event and have used them 4 times in a 5 month period. Today I saw pitting in all of them after they were cleaned and was shocked because I had read all of the great reviews before investing in these.I could not return them to Amazon because it was over 30 days and I just called Cuisinart to inquire about their ""life time warranty"". I have will have to pay to ship all three to New Jersey (I am in CA) It will take 6 weeks for them to repair (OH BOY) or replace (OH JOY) the woks. Either way, I am not happy with my choice for purchasing these. I will stick with All-Clad is the future. Saving money up front is not worth it if you have to spend money replacing your investment in less than a year."
1,Sticking pan,"Highly recomended if you only do soup/steaming, but not recommended if you stir fry because it sticks and to wash off the sticking pan is hard."
3,It's kinda good,"This is a nice pan. You can deep-fry chicken or breaded oysters, make soup or spaghetti sauce in decent quantitities.My wife likes it for stir-frying, but she doesn't understand high-heat-sear-outsides with crispy inside textures. Think of meat and veggies that are browned deeply but ""rare"" on the inside.I like carbon-steel woks over a good flame, which for us is a 16 in wok over a 30k btu flame, that works for a 2-6 people dish. We have two 30k btu burners. Is it enough? Not exactly. I'd like 3 100k btu jets, each seriously manned. Not that they have to be run full-blast, but heat is good when you want it.The Cuisinart isn't made for true Chinese stir-frying. For one thing, traditional Chinese sir-frying isn't about making your pan look like new when you have finished cooking and cleaned up. It's impossible But the Cuisinart is a really good Western girls' pan."
2,Not for induction cooktops,"Amazon lists this as a wok that is suitable for induction cooktops. It does not work on my induction cooktop, but it is a lovely pan otherwise."
5,Excellent!,Beautiful quality! I'll be shopping for a full set to replace my existing pots and pans soon. Just be careful no to use too much heat - lower heat works great as the base conducts and distributes very well.
2,This is not usable on induction cooktops.,I must have misread the information...thought it had said it would work in induction cooktops. The bottom is not magnetic. It's not induction cookware. So I had to return it.
3,misleading description,"Overall, it's an ok pan for the price, but it's not 18/10 as described, it's not oven safe up to 550F as described. Cuisinart must have downgraded its quality to cut cost. I returned it."
4,nice wok,I like this large skillet for stir frying and for larger dishes. Works great on my ceramic stove top and the price is great.
5,Run for this WOK,"Great product, better price & exceptional service. Best stir fry ever!Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 14-Inch Stir-Fry with Helper Handle and Glass Cover"
5,Looks nice; nice size,Distributes heat appropriately; GREAT for stir-frying as well as many other types of cooking. Definately a nice pan to have in the kitchen.
4,Great for vegetables,This is a very sturdy and easy to handle stir fry pan. It is very easy to wash and is very light weight.
5,A high quality pan,"I purchased this stir-fry pan as a Christmas gift for my son, who is stocking his own kitchen. First of all, it is gorgeous -- a really beautiful piece of equipment. Second, as Cuisinart products are reputed, this works wonderfully. The heat distributes quickly and well, and the pan helped my son create a lovely stir-fry meal for all of us. I am planning to replace my old stir-fry pan with this one, too -- and will probably be purchasing this second pan shortly."
2,disappointed...,"I was very excited when I found this wok at such a fantastic price! It looks great when it arrived as well. I used it everyday and I was very disappointed with its performance. Each time I stir fry in it, a round, dark, solid burnt cirle will appear right in the middle of the wok. This causes the food to smell ""burnt"" and it difficult to clean. I had to scrub and scrap it each time. Such a beautiful wok, but what a poor construction...I'm very disappointed with it."
3,The base is a bit too large,"The product description does not include the measurement of the base while the photograph makes the wok appear more tapered than it actually is. The base measures about 7-5/8"", which might well be slightly larger than your largest burner."
3,big handle,"A fine piece of hardware, but will not fit into my smaller than standard oven. For stir fry, it works wonderfuly."
2,Ehh.. Cheap,After first use showing a ring of discoloration and had no nonstick. Definitely a cheaply made pan.. Glad it was on sale otherwise I'd be pretty upset.
1,Cheap for a reason,"Priced at under 30 dollars, seemed like a good value but did not realize it has only an aluminum base plate.Per experience with other ""base plate"" pans, food will burn and stick to the sides.Returned the pan."
4,I am realy pleased with it.,"It's a realy big, good quality wok. The only bad thing I can think of is the weight. I would prefer it to be a bit heavier. But for this price I think it's excellent..."
1,Uneven cooking always burned one side,"I decided to slowly change my cookware to stainless steel and this one is not good because it always burn one side quickly and burned the food too and hard to clean. Too much hassle to return, looking to buy a different brand. Ah,will, you pay what you get. When the price is too good, you really need to think twice"
2,"Nice looking, but the sides are way too thin!","I chose the Cuisinart Chef's Classic Stainless 14-inch wok for its size and reasonable price. I received it today and I'm going to return it. The bottom of the wok has a stainless-clad aluminum disk for even heating, but the sides are just so thin that I can't believe that they will take the high heat of a stir fry without overheating. I also didn't care for the flat bottom. I have a gas stove, so a round bottom with ring is no problem. The glass lid is a nice feature.I'm going to forget stainless and order a wok in traditional carbon steel or cast iron. I want a wok that's stick-resistant with out a non-stick coating."
1,poor cook,"I got this from my son which was in my amazon wish list, to use with induction stove as its title chef's classic ""STAINLESS"" but turned out bottom part of pan is aluminum, there for useless for induction stove. Totally false advertising."
1,The worst wok I've every used,"This is the worst wok I have ever used. The bottom is too thick and transmit heat poorly and the side is extremely thin. The result? All the heat seemed to come from the side, which makes EVERYTHINK sticks to the side. Don't buy this product."
3,"Good, can be better","This is our first stainless steel wok. It is big enough for our purpose. The price is right. We have electric burner so the flat bottom works fine. We do not experience uneven heat distribution along the side because all the heat comes from bottom.However, it could be better:1. The cover does not have a hole to let out the steam like our other woks made by Chinese brands, so all the steam came out from side, that has made the stove surface too messy.2. We do not like the flat bottom. It does sit nicely on our flat stove top. But it feels awkward when you stir food inside. The inner surface is not smooth from side to bottom."
3,"Great wok, but lid shattered spontaneously.","The wok is great. The clear lid seemed great until the first time we washed it. It was sitting in a plastic coated wire drain dry rack and the edge of the lid was in one of the plate slots. There was a bit of pressure on it from the weight of the lid leaning against the wire dish support, but not a lot of stuff leaning on it or anything like that. Out of nowhere the lid shattered as if it had exploded, into thousands of roughly 1/16"" chunks. Glass all over the kitchen.We'll keep the wok, but we don't want a new lid...."
4,cuisanart stainless steel 14 inch stir fry pan,"This is a great product! I am constantly reaching for this pot or my 12"" chef's pot. Both have so many uses & are user friendly with the helper handle and glass cover. The tapered sides fit the burner nicely while giving you extra room to cook everything! You can't beat the $29.00 sale price! The stores don't can't touch that price even with coupons! I asked for this pot for Christmas & am glad I got it!"
4,i like it but,"This is a great stainless steel wok but my problem with it is the design of the handle.The wok part is abit heavy , so it needs a more rounded handle to be able to have better grip and balance in handling the wok.Aside from that it Heats up evenly and fast. Easy to clean."
5,Great wok,This is a great wok. My food doesn't stick and the pan is deep enough so I don't make a mess when I am stirring the food
4,Stir fry like an Asian,The pan does everything you would expect a stir fry pan to do.The biggest problem with almost any device like this is the loosest nut on the handle ;-)
4,Stainless steel wok,"This was a gift for my son's family. They seem to be enjoying it. If I hear anything bad, I will let you know."
3,Not for high heat cooking,"The side of the wok is way too thin and it gets burn quite often while stir frying. In order to stir fry properly, high heat is essential to get the ""breath of wok"", however, this wok cannot take the heat. well, I still like this wok for steaming whole fish. As long as you don't need to cook with high heat, this wok will be fine for you. (And if you do need to cook with high heat, get a carbon steel or iron wok. But they do require seasoning and maintenance)"
2,Not of the same quality,"I ordered this to go along with a 14-piece Cuisinart cooking set I gave to a friend for Christmas. The quality is inferior to the 14-piece set I bought from Sam's Club. It's light and thin. Plus, they shipped across country by US Postal Service. Took forever to get it. Very disappointed."
3,It can easily burn on the side,"The pot is good with the glass cover to see the inside cooking. However, the heat on the side doesn't seem to be evenly distributed. Therefore, it's very easy to burn on the side of this wok. Make sure to wash it with the soap water."
4,Works well...,"First this wok does NOT work on induction cooktops, it is not magnetic and will not heat up (as most 18/10 18/8 stainless steel)The lid is kind of heavy, probabily slightly heavier than the wok. So far it has satisfied my stir fry needs without complaint."
1,Absolute piece of crap,"The material is so light, it easily bends and food gets burnt within seconds.Very difficult to cook and maintain."
3,This is a coloring book!,"You'd never guess it from the item description, but this is not a ""paperback"" which would lead you to assume it's a book. It's actually a coloring book. The other misleading thing - it says the ""reading level is for 4-8 year olds."" Again, making you think you're buying a book. It's a fine coloring book, don't get me wrong. It's just not what I thought I was buying."
2,lame,I have Roy Dean's blue belt dvd and I think it's great. This dvd is a disaster. It's not worth $5. The shots are too far out and the instruction and camera angles stink. Everything the blue belt dvd does well this one fails at. I'm disappointed b/c I'd really like a solid dvd on wrist locks. PS The only 5* review on here at the time of this post is by TJ the guy in the video with Roy Dean... like he's gonna give it 1*.
2,Great if you like shots of people instead of ocean life,"Big disappointment. A few spectacular shots. Way too much focus on the crew. Constantly seeing shots of somebody's face peeping out at the sea life, instead of actually seeing the sea life. Way too many schoolgirl level comments. Turned it off after half an hour. I'm guessing they are keeping the good stuff for another DVD or TV show."
2,boring,This movie was not good. The main focus seemed to be the people and not the sea life. There are a lot of other deep sea documentaries that are really interesting. I'd recommend any other deep sea film before this one.
2,Kind Of A Sinker,"Director James Cameron originally made this film for 3D theaters and a lot is lost in the translation to television. ""Ghosts Of The Abyss"" served well in a smaller format, but ""Aliens Of The Deep"" just sinks and sinks. There is more emphasis on special effects and hypothesis of life on other planets than seeing the real ""Aliens"". Sure, thousands of shrimp piled around a volcanic vent is kind of cool, and that fish with two feet-like appendages is unusual, but other than a large translucent jellyfish, there's not much here. All the younger scientists look and talk like actors and the technology of going deep in clear bubble-like compartments is amazing, but it all seems too staged. The extras are interesting only in that they go into more depth about the crew and the machinery. I would recommend this perhaps, on a large 3D screen, but don't bother for the home theater."
3,Nothing Special,"This is an adequate documentary about explorations around the mid oceanic ridges but it is nothing special. It contains some interesting footage dealing both with deep sea creature and with some of the equipment and methods used to study those creatures. This is done from the points of view of several people on board the research vessels chronicled. Some are marine biologist, some are geologists, others are planetary scientists. Each takes a different spin on things.A fair amount of this program is taken up with speculation about life on other planets. This is interesting at times but, again, is nothing spectacular. That is the problem with the entire program. It deals more with the ""Feel Good"" emotions of the scientists and the ""I'm so lucky to be doing this"" reactions of the crews and the ""isn't that cool"" exclamations of all involved. A little of this goes a long way.There is nothing wrong with this program but there is nothing particularly right with it either."
2,"visually good in places, grating on the ears","The most annoying thing about this show is the annoying commentarty and its lack of technical information. Its like listening to tourists who have no idea whats going on, but enthuiastic none the less.I guess the most annoying thing though is at the start of the movie it goes on about the Sun being the source of all life on Earth, yet during the movie we are shown the Black Smokers, where the energy for life is entirely derived from chemosynthesis, and not photosynthesis. Its a complete contradiction to what was said before. I want to see Aliens from the deep, thankfully i was able to fast forward through all the waffle and 'onshore' boring scenes, which are only filler and should have been left on the editing room floor. Prepare yourself for disapointment"
4,a blow to the face of pure defiant hardcore,"Earth Crisis comes across with the most hard-hitting and lyrically controversial album since Rage Against the Machine's debut. ""Breed the Killers"" is a blow of deep grooves, suprisingly melodic notes, and lead singer Karl's stomach turning growls. It is good to see a band who hasn't conformed one bit since their beginning, especially when the current metal scene consists mostly of Korn imitators. Earth Crisis' potent live show is one of the best, and the energy shows on this album. Check out ""End Begins"", ""Breed the Killers"", ""Into the Fray"", and ""One Against All"" with Machine Head vocalist Robb Flynn."
4,SUBVERT,Getting into earth crisis? get this. Good stuff here. Nothing too complex musically but great hardcore riffs. Militant lyrics ouch!
4,Great album. But they stray from their hardcore roots,"Great Album, but they have to go back to what made them a great band. Look at the ep Destroy the Machines for example, their best cd, without all of the metallic undertones that this cd has. They used to play good hardcore, no they play good metal."
5,Great toy,"This is my son's favorite toy. He has tons of trains, cars, etc. and this is by far the one he plays with the most. He is fifteen months and he received it as a gift for his 1st birthday. It is small enough for him to handle but big enough that I don't have to worry about him chocking on little pieces. It is definitely with the money."
3,"My son loves vehicles, but not this one","My son received this when he turned 1, but for the most part, hasn't played with it. The little person does not stay in her seat very well--my husband and I have to push down hard and my son is not able to do this. He enjoys playing with the balls of dirt that came with it more than pushing the truck around. Now that he's 2, he's taken the little person that came with it and plays with him in his Ramps Around Garage."
1,Would have been nice...,I received this 2 days ago and upon opening the shipping box I was shocked and very upset to learn that the bed of the dump truck was missing (kind of the purpose for the toy). After contacting the seller immediantly I was informed that I would get a full refund and could keep the defective toy. Curious to see how my 3 year old son reacts to a bedless dump truck for his birthday.
2,Messy Bull Elk,"I bought this to add to my mancave, but after receiving it, the painting on the elk is a bit messy.Seller was great, but the product leaves a lot to be desired, even for a man cave."
1,Very Poor Sound Quality,I was really disappointed when I tried out this unit given the high rating others have given it. The sound is dull and without clarity. It is something I would expect from a clock radio with a big speaker. Don't buy this product if you want a player with high sound quality.
5,Great Kensington Customer Service,"After almost one good year of service, the unit started to have static and finally died. Couple of quick email exchanges with the Kensington customer service later, a replacement unit was on its way. Can't say enough about the great service provided by Kensington."
1,Great for 4 months,"I purchased this product four months ago. great price, great sound. I used it on average twice a week. It went dead with out a warning. the quality is suspect, if your low on cash go ahead and role the dice. I wish I had not."
1,Think twice before buying this.,I too was not impressed by the sound of this unit. A much bigger issue though was the fact that leaving my IPOD connected to the dock caused the screen to permanently dim. Not sure why this happened and the lack of in depth instructions didn't help either.Pick something else.
5,Ipod speaker,I bought the speaker to use in my office. I've found it to be quite neat and fat enough to tuck away. The audio quality is excellent and it has been worth every penny. I recommend this product to anyone.
3,Plastic Speaker yields Plastic Sound,"Everyone that raves about the sound of this unit must probably have a lower tolerance for average sound quality. Bose is the only company that I have experience with that can make a high quality sound come from a plastic housing.(I want to test out the Klipsch unit as I am very impressed with their other products.) It plays music if that is what you want, but don't believe that there is a huge range of accoustical reproduction and there is certainly no deep base or crisp highs.We have the unit in our nursery to play baby music, so it is acceptable for it's application. It's price is also pretty reasonable for its current use.However if I had to listen to this myself, I would either buy the Bose, Klipsch or connect this to my home stereo.Also, there is no adaptor for the Nano provided."
4,adjust your eq,"I ordered this speaker because of the glowing reviews. When I got it I was suprised how horrible it sounded. It sounded worse than my laptop speakers. Once I realized that I could adjust the treble and bass on my ipod, the speaker sounded 100% better. I am now happy with this speaker. It is still not the best out there, but it is great quality for the money."
4,"Great for ipod music, would be even better with a remote","I bought the Kensigton Dock for ipod together with my very first ipod (ipod nano 4G) a month ago, and I can't be more pleased with them. My husband and I have downloaded our entire CD collection into our ipod and have also downloaded music from the Internet, and now we are enjoying the music we love during parties at our house or anytime. It has a sleek design, you can put it anywhere you want and it will look great. It has a rubbery base that makes it very sturdy. The only thing I think the Kensignton dock for ipod could improve is to include a remote control."
4,We want another . . .,"We bought this as a gift for my father, and he loves it. He loves being able to charge his Ipod away from the computer and likes the sound it produces. He is so happy with this gift, that we are wanting one for ourselves."
5,Excellent Keyboard,I LOVE this keyboard. I used to have a lot of trouble typing because I have arthritis in my hands and wrists. This keyboard makes it a lot easier on my hands. I have replaced all of my home & work computer keyboards with this one. I also find the internet buttons to be quite helpful.
4,Works very well,"This keyboard is very nice, it works smoothly, was very easy to install, is comfortable to use and easy. For the price, it is a steal."
3,"Cute Toy, WAY Too Expensive","Very small toy that is nicely made and fairly soft. Much too expensive, however, for the size of the toy. Very disappointing that you can't pick the color. We got a black Yoshi, which we didn't even know existed."
1,A Total Waste of My Money,"After purchasing this product, I couldn't get it to successfully install the font that is required to run the program. I uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled until my patience ran out. I figured ""no big deal, you can always call customer support to get help."" Then I found out you have to pay per minute to speak to customer support because as the company explained, ""tech support has not been figured into the price of the product."" Well, not wanting to pay more money than I already have into this product, I went back to ordering my checks from the bank."
3,H/W version,There are about 4 different H/W (hardware) versions of this device for the same model# TFC-1000MSC. The oldest ones being H/W version B1.1R which was discontinued about 2 years ago and is not as compatible with as many devices. The newest H/W version is C1.0R. The information from this specific product does not list a H/W version so buyers be aware of which one you are purchasing.
1,not as advertised,A flimsy product with a case ill-designed to accommodate the various elements. Some blades difficult to mount on handle and impossible to secure properly.I do not recommend.
4,Exacto quality...,"Perfect for small carving, in this case I purchased as a Xmas gift for my wife for her miniatures/doll house furniture. Fit the bill perfectly!"
1,Blades are very weak,"While seemingly a nice set, they don't hold up to use in even soft pine. I've snapped two blades with minimal pressure, and several of the rest don't want to stay locked into the twist mechanism of the handle. They continually slide out.If this is American made, it's shameful. If it's Chinese made, it's typical.Either way, I am very disappointed with the quality of the blades.edit: 30 minutes later a 3rd blade has broken. This is absurd."
1,Junk.,"Found the same set at a dollar store about a week after I got this one in the mail. The only difference was the one at the dollar store was in a plastic case. So you are basically paying $22 some odd for a cheap wooden case, and a few flimsy blades that break the first time you use them. In my opinion these should not be marketed for use on any type of wood. Not worth it check your local dollar store."
2,Very small,"Tools were a smaller than they look, won't do what he wanted it to, should of sent it back, not impressed"
4,xacto X5175 carving set,"product was as advertised and perfectly served my need for a light-duty carving set...good price, exacto put together a nice set..."
4,Replacement set,I had a set of these before and lost them during a move. Use them for pumpkin carving. The blades are a little hard to change but ok once you get the hang of it. Decent for the price.
1,dont buy,"This set was not worth the money. The blades were very weak, 2 of them broke wiithin the first few days and none of the blades fit in the handle right. Everytime I try to carve they come out."
3,Xacto set,"I ordered this set because it seemed to be the best one available from Xacto. I have had a Xacto set since I was a kid, and wanted one for my daughter, as she loves using mine. Looking at the photo, it did not look as good as my old one, and I was right. There are less tools, less handles, and the box is smaller and not as cool. Seems like it will do alright for what she wants, but you're better off finding an old one in good condition."
3,Motorcycle alarm,"Good points - easy to fit, sensitive, loud if exposed. Less good points - no immobiliser, led difficult to fit (and doesn't work for me possibly because it is damaged in fitting); alarm separate to control unit would allow it to be more easily fitted where you can hear it. Overall good useful and much better than nothing."
2,"Lack of plot navigation, all scenes should move the main story forward","The acting carries this movie. That and some of the dialogue. Other than that my husband I sat watching (at least it had us engaged enough not to press ""stop"") and thanking God that we didn't pay theatre bucks for this. There are good performances by all the actors but much of it doesn't ring true. It's difficult for me to be fully engaged with a movie if I don't care about at least one of the characters (and I didn't). It seemed as though the writer/director (who does a great job acting in the movie as Shep), had no focus. Was it a comedy, a drama, or a trainwreck? It's okay to be alittle of everything as long as it rings true, comes together, and has at least one character worth caring about. This movie lacked too many of those prerequisites for my taste."
3,The long slow climb of anger.,The first hour and 10 minutes of this movie were very slow. I watched it on a plane ride to FL and almost turned it off several times. The only thing that saved it was that staring out the window would have been more boring. I realize that if they deleted the slow parts the movie would not have been more than an hour long. This would not have been a bad thing and we could have enjoyed the twist in the climax before nodding off.
3,"Pretty Good,but cluttered",the Problem with alot of films today is that they often try to be too much to everyone&miss the most important part:making any sense. Kevin Costner does a good job here. this film feels like about 3-4 films that i have seen over the past few years tied together.it gets heavy handed in spots&then shifts into more Humor.sometimes it can't make up it's mind what it wants to be.the story has moments though.
1,"""Twist"" ending is lame and insulting","This infuriatingly pointless movie features one of the most illogical surprise twist-endings I've ever had the misfortune of seeing. I won't spoil it for anyone, but I will say it renders the movie nearly nonsensical.People have typed many a positive word about the cast's performances, and to be fair there is nothing particularly wrong with the acting. But a good cast can't save a movie that has no idea what it actually wants to be about."
1,Damaged,"I hear this is a good movie, but can't play it as the DVD is visibly damaged. So what about Quality control? This disc should never have gotten out the door, but the odd thing is, I ordered 2 DVD's from Amazon - different titles, both damaged. Are you guys buying 2nds and pawning them off on us? ""F"""
1,The Upside of Anger,"Let me start with what is good about this movie. Very well acted by great actors, great atmosphere, great scenery. What completely turned me off about this movie was the utter self indulgence, self pitying mother who thinks of no one but herself and doesn't even attempt to be the least bit strong for her children. WARNING PLOT SPOILER COMING UP! STOP READING IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW! The whole basis of this movie turns on her husband leaving her. My only question at the end was, how long was he still alive in that hole while she was wallowing in self-pity. Maybe I am biased by having a mother that would have tried to keep herself together when delivering news about a sick sibling. Or possibly, if my husband suddenly went missing I would actually try to find out what happened to him before I assumed he left me for another woman. Two hours I will never get back."
4,"Great film, one of the best so far in 2005","Genre: Drama, Dark Comedy, MelodramaGenre Grade: AFinal Grade: A-This was an amazing movie. It was absolutely hysterical, devestatingly honest, and only a tad into the overly-melodramatic side. The acting was dead-on (Oscar-worthy without a doubt), and the story had so much to offer, even outside it's predictable main plot. The way this movie captures ""anger"" as the emotion itself and just the way it affects us all was incredible. I would not be suprised to see this little indy win some awards, but I hope Hollywood doesn't forget about it since it was released so early.I recommend this movie to everyone. It's not all that artistic (in other words it won't confuse/scare off those of you who don't like those kinds of movies). It reminded me of a cross between American Beauty and The Virgin Suicides, only this movie had a lot more heart in it."
3,The Upside of Allen,"This film pretends to be all about ""the twist"" but actually it is all about Joan Allen. Costner, once again playing Costner (so much so he wears a jacket he has worn in other efforts), and his fellow actors (Witt, Russell, Christensen, Wood and Binder) merely provide Allen straight lines off of which to play.Promoted as a (middle-aged) date flick - and judging from our audience, successfully so - the film is actually a mother daughter story (despite the gender of its writer/director). Hence anger's real ""upside.""Choppy, often dull and with a very questionable premise, the movie will nevertheless satisfy if you assume the story (after an ominous flashback) begins with the Wolfmeyer family working through a recent adulterous affair by the husband.Go, enjoy the upside of Allen/"
3,Weird ending.,"The Upside of Anger starring Joan Allen and Kevin Costner seemed like an interesting and funny film but this is one of the strangest films of 2005. The ending is completely ridiculous and comes from nowhere, Allen's character is so unlikable, I can't believe how narrissitic she comes off. Keri Russell and Evan Rachel Wood are the only two characters that have some depth and Costner isn't too bad as others have stated. This film starts off promising but ends up drowning in its own stupidity. Stay away from this absurd turkey."
2,Misses the mark,"This movie features Joan Allen as a woman whose husband has left her. She drowns herself in booze and anger and leaves her four daughters in exasperated confusion as she flounders around trying to make sense of a new life without her husband. As her daughters are going through important passages in their lives, she continues on her bitter way, showing little support for their hopes and dreams. Her only solace is her next-door neighbor, a former professional baseball player (Kevin Costner) who offers her companionship and understanding. The movie seems to have an identity crisis and has moments of comedy, drama, and darkness which alternate in no particular order and for no particular purpose. I spent the first 3/4 of the movie trying to decide where it was going and the last part, marveling at the ill-advised twist at the end. The acting was good, but the writing and plot were not and the results were very unsatisfying for this viewer."
2,The Upside of Anger,"The Upside of Anger~ Joan Allen is a misnomer for this picture as it should have been called the upside of tedium. The movie is supposedely under 2 hours but it sure feels like one is watching it for 2 weeks, months or even years. Kevin Costner is ok in his role but the rest of the cast seemingly mail in their performances. The story line is alright but implodes at the end and the ending is kind of lame and predictable. It is strange to say this since Costner sure has made his sure of really bad and horrid movies over the years, but he is the star of this mediocre flick and prevents me from giving it one star. I was espcially perplexed that Keri Russel does such a lame job but the character that she was given was also paper thin so she did what she could with a bad part. This movie is tedious, boring, long and lame but still not so bad that it gets one star, but two stars is just what it deserves."
1,One of the Worst Films Ever Made,"If you don't want to waste two hours of your life, skip this movie. It is truly awful, the acting, the plot, the characters, there is nothing here. The only good thing that I can say is that at least I didn't spend one penny on this piece of crap (I checked it out from the library). I will always regret the two hours I spent watching it."
2,"Good cast, poor film","When I saw the cast of this film, I hired it. It wasn't bad but I can't say that I was overwhelmed with enthusiasm. It was a bit slow although the surprising twist at the end makes you think how you make emotive assumptions based on the facts which are often quite erroneous. I won't say more so as not to spoil it for you but it wasn't up to my expectations."
2,Needs something more,"Good cast. Female lead should have more compassion, otherwise a fairly good story."
2,2 and 1/2 stars,"This movie had some good actors and could have been much better. As it was, it was very choppy and not quite all there. The storylines for the characters were good, but the stories all seemed to jump around so much and never played out the way you would expect. It seemed as if they tried to crame a very long novel into 2 hrs of film and it didn't work. The ending was very unexpected, which I liked, but the characters fell flat for me."
3,Okay,Most of the movie to me was depressing. There were a few parts that were funny. I mainly bought it b/c I am a big fan of Kevin Costner.
1,...is the downside of boredom,"I cared not one whit for these characters. As for the daughter writing the story of her family's life, her readers are all in her head. It's as if the makers of this fluff attended all the 12-step programs they could find and concocted a script that mixed self-help babble and Emotions Anonymous insights. Yes, I'm really sure that a 17 year-old girl has a lot to say about the nature of relationships, repressed emotions, sexual turmoil, and the human condition. Please!! I just could't wait to get out of the theater. And I wish the entire family fell into the well, with the exception of Joan Allen, of course. She's such a sexy fox. There should be sex scenes aplenty with her and Costner. The makers of this movie clearly do not know how to sell this film."
4,poignant and lovely,"The movie has a star-studded cast, but no one competes for the space on screen. The script is smartly handled. The movie also handles the change of seasons, to show the passing time, very well. It brings a good point about anger and about knowing all sides of the story. I agree that the truth is only every partially correct. This movie made me miss quite a few people I haven't spoken with in a while and wonder about lost ties and misunderstandings."
4,The Taming of the Shrew,"I avoided this movie for a long time because I expected another Kevin Costner vehicle. This time he plays an over-the-hill baseball player that might bring to mind all the other sports movies he's starred in.But Joan Allen is the main event here. Unlike her low key (icy?) role in the Ice Storm, in this one she has fangs. She lashes out at each of her lovely daughters between (and sometimes during) bouts with the bottle with the meanness of a rattlesnake. You can see the confusion and heartbreak in each of her daughters in turn as she mocks and demeans. (This movie will be best understood by adult children of alcoholics.) Only the Kevin Costner character, initially her co-enabler, seems to be able to reach a softer place within her, but he too is not spared some fearful tongue lashings.Only when the final plot twist revealed itself did this viewer came fully to understand and sympathize with this seemingly hateful woman."
3,Watch out for pop-up blockers!,"Cute pop-up book. The saucy subject matter doesn't go beyond the bare boobie level, opting for frisky over ferocious."
2,DISAPOINTED!,i WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS TERMED A POP-UP BOOK AND IT WAS NOT REALLY A POP-UP BOOK. IT WAS MORE A SLIDE TAB TYPE OF BOOK.
1,lousy.. not worth the buy,"lousiest 10 dollars i spent. the tips are already bent and thats at maybe 10 minutes or so of fooling around with it. ive tried it with multiple guitars and the effects and theres no such thing as this thing getting a ""bow"" effect. i dunno. scratchy. i dont recommend this at all. ive been playing the guitar for about 13 years now."
5,"Fun for me, but not for everyone.","Well, for me it's a curious thing.The Jellifish changes a lot the texture of the pluck when you strum or do arpeggios but it's a little fragile.I like it so that I play with it a lot of time since I bought it but I have a strong strumming stile so the tires, the largest ones, are breaking from the root. This is not a flaw of the Jellifish, they are very clear about that to produce the sounds they say it's better to do it by light strum and picking. It's just that I get emotional when I play, jajaja.I also founded a way to use it as a physical cello bow. Note this pick is for textures cause it not produces an effect like a pedal.It's a smart product that could bring some new life in your playing, but only if you're open minded and don't expect a pick and neither a pedal effect kind of sound.I only want I always have a new one available, they have a 6 month lifetime I read somewhere in the jellifish page."
2,nothing to write home about !,"The Jellifish is no replacement for a twelve string guitar. You can not play it fast, it is fragile, and the tone is scratchy. That being said it can be used to make some interesting sounds for color in rhythm and slow lead playing. It is not something I would use often. My 1.00 mm Clayton feels and sounds great after after a few minutes of playing the Jellifish. After one hour of use the Jellifish is starting to show signs of wear and tear. So don't say you weren't warned."
3,Gimmick,"For the cost, this is one of the most expensive picks around. Of course, it is dynamic, but it falls short of the its acclaimed ability to reproduce 12-string and chorus effects. The sounds you can get from this thing are pleasing and otherworldly. However, I can't justify paying more than four dollars for it, especially since mine broke after a couple weeks of use.Its a fun thing to play around with, but buy one at a store, don't pay the full price and THEN shipping. I really don't think the Jellyfish is worth $15."
1,DO NOT BUY,"The jellifish breaks easily even if you are careful and read the instructions. It is so delicate it is rendered nearly unusable and is therefore impractical.Its metal tines could also easily scratch the finish on your expensive guitar whether your finish is wood or metal. It is an interesting idea but it really should be made with stiff plastic tines, or if metal the tines should be made with tougher material that won't break, but how could they sell more then?"
1,A Cleverly (But Misleadingly) Marketed Piece of Junk,Wish I had read the reviews here before dropping the 10 bucks. Feels like playing with a hacksaw blade. Esteban should be selling this thing on infomercials. Cheesh.
4,Great DVD,This DVD is great...If you're an A.F.I fan you should buy it...I love it a lotthe only thing that I didn't like that much was that they played all songs a little bit slower that in the original cd tracks.
4,A Must Have for old and new AFI fans,I Heard a Voice is superb...it really gives you a realistic feel of a live AFI show. Only downside? I think it would have been SLIGHTLY better with more interviews with the band.
3,Good but could of been better,"I would personally give it 3 1/2 stars. Its pretty much all of Decemberunderground and a few songs from other albums. Personally I think it needed some more Black Sails and Art of Drowning in the set list. Then sprinkled some more (just one) songs for the ATASF, SYMAOYE, and Very Proud era."
4,Amazon does it again,"Anyone or thing that can keep my son happy is a marvel, and this album along with his Rise Against one has done just that!"
4,I head a voice,"Ive AFI live and it was much different from this dvd. Davey screwed up a few times and his screams werent that great live. They played for an hour and it felt like I got jipped. There was a few good spots in the show, but it wasnt as great as I'd hoped. Not going stop liking the music do to this though, I belive the in music and not the outside actions of a band."
4,I liked it!,I liked this book but is it not your typical romance I was surprised at this book the love the the character showed for each other was beautiful . This book is not about romance it is about love true love about what you will endure for some that you truly love. Qwaz as a man women dream about . I did not cry but I was sad for what to endure.I thought I had this book figured out but I was wrong and surprised by the ending.
1,A Study in Sorrow,"This book should have been listed as a tragic novel rather than a romance novel, albeit written well and the story exemplifies true love, it is NOT the reason I read romance stories. I read romance novels for escapism and some form of happily ever after, this book was nothing close to either. Truthfully, I was left sad and angry and that is just not the reason I want to read a romance novel. If I wanted to read about the tragedy of war and the unfairness of life; I would simply pick up a newspaper. I know life can't always be happily ever after, but for me the only stories I want to read will be. This book is about heartbreak and recovery, it was the saddest book I've ever read, purely sorrowful. I found nothing romantic or salvaging about the tragic ending. I wish I'd never read this story!!"
1,Saddest Story,"I have read over 800 romance novels and this had to be by far the saddest story I have ever read. After I finished, I had to stop reading for a while because the book made me so depressed."
5,An outstanding book - buy it!!,"This is an outstanding documentation of humanitarian crises by one of the world's best photojournalists. Stoddart's photos are truly moving - yet never sensational. Rather they reveal to us the quiet dignity of the human spirit in some of the most atrocious situations possible, famine, floods, ethnic cleansing, war, earthquakes etc. In all of his pictures it is the human spirit which shines through. It's impossible to look at these pictures passively, and difficult at times not to be moved to tears.This book is a call for us to heighten our awareness of what's happening in the world today, away from cosy armchairs and the madness of, and obsession with 'celebrity culture', to shake off our 'compassion fatigue' and take action while we still have some consciousness to prevent and alleviate such suffering. How can we live in the same world as these pictures and not want to do something to improve our common human journey?Buy it as soon as you can, and share it!"
3,Boring as a set,"My 18 month old son will take a couple of the individual pieces and walks around holding them and making the animal sound but is not interested in playing with it as a set. For his 1 year birthday, he got almost the complete set of Little People's and just never was interested in any of them.I will say that it is extremely durable because he uses the larger pieces to try and climb things now (as stepstools). I was disappointed by his lack of response because I thought the toys were interesting."
2,Sound Engineer Scuttles Solemnis,"What a great disappointment!!!! A monumental choral work is made anemic by a faulty sound track. The chorus and male soloists sound distant from the dominating sound of the orchestra. When the soloists sing in quartet, the male voices, especially the bass, are almost overpowered by the soprano and alto; not that the men don't have powerful voices. It is due to poor sound engineering. On blu-ray, the visual is sharp in detail. If only the sound were!!!!"
3,I would give it five but ...,"The darn book only goes up to chapter 9! From vectors and on you on your own, ::sigh::"
2,Different Singer,"I loved the Stryder's first album 'Masquerade in the ...', but this doesnt even sound like the same band. I had read somewhere they had a new singer for this album, and because of that they just lost that distinct sound. I was very disapointed in this album."
1,Mmmmmmm.......talented,"Wow, these guys sure are amazing. From the singers whiny, pre-pubescent voice, to their shallow, immature, less complicated than limp bizkit's lyrics, I don't see how they even got a record deal! Even, and I don't use this phrase often, Good Charlotte is better than them! If you would like to hear some actually decent music, try sampling anything from Thrice, Lostprophets, Letter Kills, or Flaw."
4,Historical Writing With Grace and Heart,"Nothing dry and academic about this account of courage in the pursuit of human dignity. Mr. Gaillard is a first-rate journalist, but his ""facts"" are less concerned with numbers and gobbledygook than with the people things happen to, and who make the wheels go 'round. Good history, great storytelling. One for the spirit as well as the reference value."
2,Thoroughly mediocre,"Well... It's not terrible. It's also not particularly good. The plot drags at points, and is overly unrealistic at others (I realize that it calls itself a fairy tale, but still...) Oddly, it manages to sound dated and stilted despite being quite recent. But, as mentioned, not terrible. It could be a quick, fluffy, slightly enjoyable read. It won't stay with you, and it won't change your life. And if you're looking for some teen-girl-coming-of-age thing, there are much better places to look."
4,Best of the Bunch,"Easily the best of the 6-inch movie figures, this one looks just like the guy in the trailers. His expression is very cool -similar to the big non-roaring rotocast Hulk, and the molding and proportions are dead-on. The paint job is fairly basic and the blue pants are very plain, but they've made some effort to put colour graduation on the skin, and the eye detailing is good. He comes with a wall for him to punch holes in - a lever on his back makes his arms move up and down and squeezing his legs turns his waist. The features are surprisingly unobtrusive, and he's a durable figure with plenty of play value. Much better out of the package than I thought!"
4,an acquired taste,Not the best I've heard from SolidState but deffinately one of my favorites! The guitars are real thick and chunky with grungy rock sounds to them. The drums are rather exceptional...very punkish. Vocals...I dont know how to describe them! Deffinately different...if your looking for 100% emotion...don't look here...But deffinately a good buy for fans of Blindside & System of a Down
2,Disappointed,"I love the stage performance Alegria, but I have never seen the movie. I thought the movie would be simply the same show on big screen, and I was wrong. Should have done my research! The title song was the biggest disapointment. I know this is a different arrangement, but I was hoping for the same singer. I love the original singer very much. Her voice was so captivating. The singer in this album has a very low and deep voice, kind of gloomy and depressing. I prefer the orignal arrangement which is a lot more celebratoral in mood - isn't ""alegria"" supposed to mean ""happiness""? The rest of the album is fine. The third song is very good."
3,not as pretty,not as sparkly as it looks in the picture. but still a good looking piece..i was expecting much higher quality owning other godfinger products. cuts are not good.
2,not necro worthy!,"i have been a big necrophagia fan ever since i picked up legacy of gore, horror, and sickness from harmony house like 8 years ago. i dont know what this album is. this is pathetic because i know that killjoy, anton crowley (phil anselmo) wayne could do much better than this. necrophagia should be in every death metal collection. killjoy has a way of making you feel the horror and brutality in his music and that makes him a very sick man. i used to watch through the eyes of the dead dvd over and over again. there are some sick ass videos on it, plus interviews with phil, opal, killjoy, and set practice from the band. i would recomend this, or legacy of gore, horror and sickness if you can find it. divine art.. is also a good cd. Jenna Jameson was the cover model and a friend of killjoy's."
1,Designed to Die,"Dallas is... No, not the city...the mystery solvoing protaganist who lives in Dallas, Texas, in Chloe Green's novel, Designed to Die. This book is about as thought-provoking as naming a main character Dallas, that lives in Dallas. Dallas O'Connor, a stylist turned murder-solver does, however, have some good intuition. When she is on a boat headed to her new mysterious styling assignment she surmises: ""Seattle was behind us, Canada to the right... Not that I could see it, but it was there."" The dialogue is shallow and the characters are unrealistic. Forget suspense, thrill, and intrigue. Look for this novel that is ""designged to die"" in the humor section of your local book store."
2,"Not Celtic, not very good","There are only a couple of tracks that are truly Celtic hymns, most are ordinary contemporary Christian songs, and all are new age arrangements. Definitely not a Celtic album."
2,"What happenned to ""Factual Account""?","In Dec 1978 a terrible incident happened in Sa'adi district of Shiraz.It is strange that the Author makes no mention of it in her book.The Author explains in vivid details the looting and plunder of Bahai homes in Dec 1978 in Saa'adi district. However, the Author seems to have selective memory about the events.What was the incident I am referring to?In December 1978, in Sa'adi district of Shiraz, an armed Bahai man opened fire to the Muslim crowd with his G3 machine gun.He killed 13 people (including his wife) and another 30 were taken to hospital with gunshot wounds. He then killed himself.If ""Olya's story"" is a factual account, then why does it fail to mention that terrible incident?"
1,OK Product -- TERRIBLE Customer Service,"Received a necklace for Christmas and tried to exchange it..they would not let me stating their vendors ""charge 40% restocking fee."" Communication is only done through email so when they are done with you they don't have to reply, I could not get anyone on the phone to speak with. Clearly they are more concerned out charges than keeping a customer happy..will NEVER use this company again and will advise others to make sure you like your selection or else you will be stuck with it."
4,"Very good, if unusual","This is a rather odd novel, broken down into a series of stories, vignettes and (mis)adventures involving various members of the Browne family, `mixedbloods' from an Indian reservation in northern Minnesota. As the title suggests, Vizenor is deeply interested in trickster themes, here borrowed from Native American and (to a lesser extent) Chinese oral traditions. Also, the concept of mixedbloods is the overriding leitmotiv of the entire book - often symobolized by mongrels. The style varies, and this is a very postmodern literary experience, but that shouldn't stop anyone from reading it. Generally this is a rewarding book: the narrative, if difficult to follow at times, is often humerous, yet behind this light-hearted veneer there is quite a bit of scathing commentary."
2,Major flaw in design,"These are sturdy and in principal should be much better than the clip on T post insulators. However, when you screw them down, the threaded body collapses, so you can't crank them down tightly. The design flaw is obvious - a plastic stop needs to be cast into the back part of the slot to keep this rigid. There is a small triangular set of mating stops there, but they don't line up and are too thin to work. Such a simple thing, I wonder why the manufacturer doesn't fix this."
1,A hatchet job,"Riddled with factual errors, an exercise in character assassination for reasons that are never frankly stated, this book is an excretion."
2,Not good,"I just got this set today, and as I gently tested out the various pieces, the tang of the 3/8 U-shaped gouge broke inside the handle. Also, the whittling blade moves a little despite having the handle fully tightened."
4,Great for pumpkin carving,"Every year we bought those cheap, plastic Pumpkin Masters carving sets for $6-8 so our kids could carve their own pumpkins. Inevitably they broke. No more. This set came with a #15 keyhole saw blade that should last through several seasons of pumpkin carving. It's safe enough for my kids (6 and 9) to use with supervision. If you already have an X-acto knife and want to do some pumpkin carving just buy the #15 blades, which are about $8 for a 5 pack on Amazon."
5,The Legacy of Steel creates its own great legacy,"This was a great book. The book portrays the story of Sara Dunstan , adoptive mother of Steel Brightblade three years after the war against Chaos and the creation of the Legion of Steel. An enoyable tale filled with adventure , danger , and honor. A definite read for any dragonlance fan."
3,Mediocre at best,"I finished this book 2 days ago after letting it sit in my library for nearly 3 years. I have to say that I find the book uncompelling and simple. I mean, with the word ""simple"", that the charecters have no depth at all, when the author needs a person, boom, he/she's there.What disappointed me most was the dragon Cobalt. I understand that dragons can be fond of their riders (and don'T get me wrong I've been reading DL for quite some time now) but this one is just childish. Almost as if he's a pet. He is lacking depth as well. The main plot of the book is unclear until the last 60 or so pages. The reader has no idea what the book's all about.But, the book takes hold of the reader now and then. Some parts of the book is definitely exiciting but all in all not a very good effort on Herbert's part."
5,Absolutely fantastic!,"Mary Herbert has definitely re-energized my interest in the DragonLance Saga. Sara and Cobalt enjoy invaluable times together, heroicly spirited and heartfelt. This glimpse at the relationship between dragon and human is wonderfully portrayed. Villians and sub-characters are well written; and with dragons being the most celebrated and basic creatures in the Saga, more tales of their personal adventures would surely be appreciated. A ""Dragon's Tales"" series? If you love DragonLance, don't miss this one!"
1,No subtitles,"This is a movie I already have for some years on region 2 DVD and with Subtitles,in very good quality. I would have given it 5 stars if it would have been subtitled. Besides Universal and Warner home video there are more studios who sell movies on DVD-R making them unattractive for a lot of people who cannot follow the movie without subtitles. Why can't they give us the old movies with subtitles regionfree, this way we have to miss a lot of movies we are dying to have. Besides that Warner is asking a much higher price than we had to pay for boxes of films with subtitles and some extra's. Things have not changed for the better.Ad de KoningAlmereHolland"
5,"NOT HARRYHOUSEN, BUT GOOD BLUE SCREEN","THIS ONE HAS THE IDEA OF ""THE BEGINNING OF THE END."" IN STEAD OF PLANT FOOD THERE ARE INJECTIONS ALL AROUND. THE MAD SCIENTIST GETS HIS(WHAT A SUPRISE.) ALTHOUGH YOU CAN FEEL SORRY FOR THIS ONE. THIS MOVIE IS LIKIBLE. AND A STANDERT 50'S LOVE STORY. GIVES YOU A WARM FUZZY. THIS ONE IS NOT ABOUT RADIATION, BUT MESSING WITH NATURE. COULD BE ""PROPHICES"" GRANDFATHER WATCH FOR CLINT, HIS DAY WAS MADE. GREAT FOR AN OLDTIME CREATURE DOUBLE FRATURE. SO SIT WITH YOUR BEST GIRL, A BOWL OF POPCORN AND RETURN TO A SIMPLER TIME FOR A FEW HOURS. YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF. HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME. WE DID."
4,Good example of 1950s creature horror,"While Mara Corday is the lead actress, and gives a good performance, I was interested to see where Clint Eastwood would appear. His role as a jet pilot with only his eyes showing was even smaller than Corday's role some years in Eastwood's The Gauntlet. Over all the film is a good example of the 1950s horror genre"
3,SPIDER WITH AN ATTITUDE,"WHAT DO YOU GET WHEN YOU MIX JOHN AGAR,MARA CORDAY AND LEO G. CARROL? YOU GET TARANTULA!THIS TIMEIT'S THE SPIDER WHO MUTATES AND WRECKS HAVOC,BUT REST ASSURED THAT IN THE END THE SPIDER GETS HIS COMEUPPENCE!LOOK FOR CLINT EASTWOOD IN A CAMEO APPEARENCE.HINT,HE'S BEHIND A MASK"
3,a tad overrated,"From seeing nothing but good reviews for this film, I was expecting big things, and was dissapointed. First of all, WHY WHY WHY is a woman named Steve? What were her parents thinking? Then, there's the plot holes. I cringed when the scientist guy found a huge puddle of spider spooge and immediately decided he should taste it. Also, once he finds out there's a giant spider around, he flies to some professors 200 miles away without telling anyone in the town. I know no one would have believed him, but that brings us to the biggest plot hole of all. Are we really suppossed to believe that absolutely no one has seen this thing walking around? At least the scientist and ""Steve"" should have noticed; it was right behind their car in the beginning! However, I did find Leo G. Carroll good as the doomed scientist, and Clint Eastwood does some great acting with just his eyes as a bomber pilot wearing a helmet and an oxygen mask."
5,EEEWWW!!! CREEPY!!!!!,"Definitely one of the better sci-fi films of the 50's, with awesome effects that may look dated yet still look menacingly real, especially those long distant shots of the spider stalking its brutal way across the desert. Yep, that's Clint Eastwood. You should recognize his voice. This is perfect for a Saturday afternoon with friends if you love horror flicks from the 50's."
1,Disappointing,"I should have read about the content more carefully. I thought this would be an uplifting book, but it's about disgruntled sisters who were bitter over petty things and left their order to enter into lesbian or other self-centered lifestyles. They did help the poor, all the while patting themselves on the back and pointing proudly at their accomplishments. Not really informative or inspiring unless your looking to read another trash the nuns book."
4,Easy add-on,"Nice product - appears well constructed. I had no problems installing a 160gig Maxtor and getting it up and running real quickly.Only problem was the outer covering material ""slides"" open to reveal the chassis - as it is supposed to. ""Slides"" - yes, but not easily! You've really got to tug pretty hard because of the close fit.Also, note that in XP there is apparently a small bug in which it will not always recognize a removable drive in Explorer. Apprently will be fixed this summer in a maintenance release. You can go into computer management | Disk Management to see the new, removable drive and then Change the drive letter.I was always able to see the drive in a CMD (DOS) box, too.I just ordered a second unit of this Dual-Link"
2,meh,"i purchased one of these a few months ago for a maxtor 250 gig hard drive. its a generally nice case, and installation was easy enough. its recently started throwing lots of i/o errors through, and i've ruled out the hard drive itself or the computer its attached to. meh, maybe it'll still be good for an optical drive or something. also, the fan is small and cheap, not quite up to the task of cooling a seriously used hard drive, and has gotten a bit noisier with age. anyway, my hard drive is in another (incidentally, better made and less expensive) case now, and much happier for it."
5,Best CD version capturing the 80's,"If you love 80's new wave. This double CD captures the best of the best. Great sounding disc, excellent song selection. Whatmore can you ask for? 5 stars."
4,works great,Easily cut through some small metal tubing. Have only used one of the blades but they are identical except for the height of the saw.
4,Xacto Quality,This saw is really nice. I use it to cut through multi layer PCBs. It takes a little bit to get through the thick copper layer but it works like a champ. I wish there was a storage case with it like what comes with a lot of the Xacto knife sets.
3,Catnip Bunny,"Well the cats seemed to like it OK, but for an item with catnip in the title, this was not at all very catnip-y. The seam in the back was also easily ripped open by the cats within a couple of days (to remove the tiny bag of catnip, of course)."
3,"Oh, how I wanted to like these books.","Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed these novels when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing. But they're just not as good as the hype. They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while. The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women. Maybe it's because I read the Lovejoy books before these -- if I had come to them without knowing about Lovejoy, I would have enjoyed them more."
1,Too cute for words (or reading),"This trilogy was recommended to me by my ex-wife, which should have told me something right off the bat. Only too late I realized that I had read one of the stories before, and hadn't cared for it.The protagonist is, as he is intended to be, an offensive, arrogant prick. The problem is he is offensive and arrogant to the reader as well as the other characters, and by...oh let's say page three...becomes extremely tiresome.The plots vary from totally implausible to actively offensive.If you want to read some serious, adult mysteries read the Martin Beck books. You can leave the Hon. Charlie Mordecai to himself and his self-satisfied drivel."
3,Pretty fixture,"We saw this at a friend's home and loved it. It is lovely and unique. The covers aren't great quality but once it is up, who will know."
1,UNSAFE TOY,I purchased this toy and then returned it when I realized the disks were hard plastic! If they ever hit a child in the eye it could be disastrous! I have purchased disk shooters in the past that had soft foam disks that were harmless. I can't believe this toy is on the market.
4,A Vegetarian Nutritional Reference Book for Babies,"The New Vegetarian Baby is a must have for families raising vegetarian children. It offers detailed information about the nutritional needs and requirments for infants and toddlers. Helpful information regarding nutritional guidlines for preganant and lactating women are also reviewed. This book includes information on other topics, ranging from managing home and work to weaning and development. There are a few recipes with sample feeding menus, but it is more of a reference book than a cookbook. Interesting topics combined with easy reading make this book a recommended choice for vegetarian families."
4,Very resourceful Book,"Enlightening, beneficial,expert advise on raising a vegan/vegetarian baby/child. It is full of useful information to parents raising vegan children. It has menus on what to feed the children, serving amounts, amongst much much more information on the vegan lifestyle. I highly recommend this book."
2,Not worth the price,"This item is contructed mainly of plastic which will wear and breakdown at some point. When plugged into the USB port it is kind of loose which might result in problems with the port or the reader.The cable makes it a bit easier, but over all this unit is not that durable.It does read my CF II cards but it does not read my hitachi microdrives (1 gig or 2 gig) so beware!"
3,"Mixed results - great, but...","When I first got this, I was very impressed. Simple to install, easy to use, and veryinexpensive! But... on about my third use, I accidentally jammed my camera card inthere incorrectly. It missed the electrical connector and slid too far in! I couldn'tget it out, but my DH managed to get it out. After that, putting it in carefully toensure that it seats correctly has worked."
1,Fell apart after a week...,"Had a PQI reader just like it which I lost, got this one. It fell apart after a week. I took it apart and fixed it, but it still reads very SLOW, about 1/10 of the speed of the PQI. The card DOES fit well inside of the reader, well at least before it got stuck inside of it. I give up on readers unless I can find another PQI...Ill just use the cable for photo transfers....HD Tach reported a tranfer rate of 2.8 Mbps with th PQI showing 11 Mbps on same USB port. Not worth sending back, let alone dealing with Amazon.com with returns."
4,Exactly What I Needed,"I wanted an external drive for backup. This drive and the included backup software filled the bill to a ""Tee"". Since it is the emergency backup drive, I disconnect it when not in use to protect it, and it is very easy to bring up or power down.The only knock I have is that documentation is sparse for both drive and backup software, but it is straightforward enough for someone who is not a total novice (after all, it is plug-and-play).I am running a very new HP Pavillion with Windoze Vista Home Premium."
1,"Great price, if only it worked...","I bought this drive because it was priced well for its capacity. I tried installing it on my Mac according to the quick install guide included with it. First I tried using Firewire, but the drive never mounted, nor did the drive turn on automatically as the directions said it would. Then I tried using USB and the same thing happened: nothing. Before returning it, I tried using the company's support page. There are a lot of knowledge base answers but nothing I could find pertaining to my problem. I then tried contacting them using their question form. After filling everything out and having paid special attention to all the required items, I was greeted with the message that my submission had failed. I tried to go back and correct whatever the problem was, but alas that was impossible. I will not be purchasing this company's products in the future."
4,Neat Stuff,"Well, this is showing a return of girl power! However, unlike the spice girls girly style or the all saints sophisicated style, this group emphasises on the fun side of life through their music. Overall, it's a great cd and one i recommend. Best of luck to you Girls....."

2,Dark suspense/Suspect Thriller,"BLINDSIDE tries to create suspense by filming most of the movie in dark scenes. That's it! If you care for Harvey Keitel, this might be worth watching; that is if you could see Keitel and the rest of the cast in the dark shadows. The only thing I found thrilling was being able to sort out most of the characters. I finally figured out that most of the actors were going to be killed by being doublecrossed. That was thrilling. This was not an entertaining film."
4,A very good read.,"Russell has the incredible ability to teach me a lot-the hospitality industry, West Point and the military, personal history of presidents, dueling, and more-while telling great story. Travis was a wonderful character. His descriptions of the Washington D.C. area are excellent. Even though it definitely bogged down at the end, I started in early in the morning, read it at lunch and finished it when I came home from work. I really enjoyed this book."
1,Poor!,That was probably old piece of junk that was sold. I could not figure it out how to use. Wasted my money. Please be advised before buying.
1,Horrible,This carving set is horrible the handle is too loose for the knife blades and the gouges don't fit the handle at all. I thought that x-acto was a quality company but I guess not.
3,Cool Cut,this remains one of my favorite cuts by Usher. the Groove fits him and this is a cool going to the club type of cut. the remixes are cool.I dig the chorus and the harmony he displays on this cut. hard to believe it's 6 years old because it sounds fresher to me than much of his last album.
3,Nice kit if you need most of the blade styles. You'll need to re-gule the blade magnet at some point.,"I liked this kit simply because it gave me three awesomely useful x-acto knives in one place. However, I couldn't get real utility out of the majority of the non-standard blade shapes. The glue that holds the magnet on the inside of the lid for the blades also started to give after a few months, so I'd get the whole strip of blades when I wanted one."
5,Great stocking stuffer,"This is a very nice set that is useful for a large variety of tasks. I bought one for my husband for woodworking, and one for my friend that is a grade school teacher. They both liked them."
4,Exactly what I wanted!,"This is a good little kit. It includes a wide variety of replaceable blades and 3 knives. I went to work with it immediately. Very convenient to own. If you cut stencils, build models, or do detailed paper sculpture, it is perfect."
5,Present,"This was a present for my wife, the box is made of wood, it has magnets to keep the blades at their place, the handles are made of metal, very sturdy, interchangeable blades, one for every need."
3,good only for paper,"It cuts paper just ok, but I tried foam board about 1/10"" thick and it did very bad job. I used to cut foam board like this before with regular Office Depo paper knife. Disappointed."
3,Nice,"This basic knife set is ok, the blades are sharp but they keep comming loose from the handles, i guess this is what you canexpect from an inexpensive set of knifes."
2,Defective,One of the blade vices was defective and would not secure the blade. Would have been better to buy the product locally for easy return.
2,missing pieces,would have been nice if it had come complete....the red handled knife was missing the piece that holds the blade in place.it is a half-circle in shape and screws onto the metal at the top of the knifedo i have to return the entire kit?
2,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,I BOUGHT 1 SIMILAR IN A DOLLAR STORE. SO U KNOW HOW MUCH I PAID. THE ONLY DIFFERENT IS THE CASE. MINE WAS PLASTIC. IF U WANT A GOOD KNIFE GO TO HOMDEPOT. THAT ONE IS WORTH IT. I TESTED THEM AND THE ONE FROM HOMEDEPOT WAS ALOT BETTER MADE. U JUST NEED TO BUY XTRA KNIFE FOR $1.00.
5,AWESOME!,"I fell in love with this set the first time I saw it, and knew i wanted it. I do calligraphy, and my boyfriend does little jobs here and there where he can use the knives to help. They are all very sharp, and the box it comes in is beautiful. I cant complain about this except that the glue that holds up the extra blades kept allowing the magnet that holds the blades to fall, causing me to stab myself on them a few times. Other than that, these are amazing."
3,Perfectly decent knife set,"Knives are fine, box is nice, but the plastic casing that the knives sap into is not great. It holds them much too tightly, and I fear that over time it will get damaged as the knives are snapped in and out of it."
5,No home should be without...,"I use these for any kind of intricate cutting (papercrafts or scrapbooking),wouldn't be without them.These are my second X-acto knife set because my first set was from my ex-hub's and he had them in high school shop class !!!"
4,A very useful set,"This is a very useful set, with all types of blades to choose from. I've used it for crafts, fixing the car, and repairing a telemark ski boot. Somehow wish they could figure out how to keep them sharper for a bit longer, but I guess that's just the reality of knives."
4,Perfect for my 19 mth old child,I ordered this as a christmas gift for my child and it was perfect. it wasn't too big and has great speed. It also is durable and allowed my child to use it with ease.
4,It's fun for the age it's intended for.,"This is a fun and tough little remote vehicle. It can turn it's way out of most jams. The only drawback is the range of the remote, which does not allow the user to get more than a few feet from the skid loader."
1,Biased History Book,"A biased saunter through history and USA culture. Too bad the author's views color the whole work. Some interesting tidbits of history, but mainly a rehash of well known developments. I doggedly slogged my way through because I was researching this time period. Not nearly enough information on the everyday life of ordinary people. Not really all that helpful. I got more info from the internet than this book. Don't waste your money. Get it at the library if you must read this book."
3,Inherit the Tide,This book took my attention immediately but tended to fade in the last chapters. It is a good read especially for a first book for this author. I would recommend it to a young teen.The story celebrates 3 strong women . No profanity or lurid sex scenes. Well done.
4,Article Transformations,"This book not only highlights the unique jewellery designs of Denise and Samuel Wallace, but also gives an insight into the Aleut culture of Native America and shows how Denise incorporates her heritage into her contemporary jewellery designs.The book is well illustrated with beautifully photographed jewellery as well as explaining the history of the Eskimo traditions and referencing where Denise draws her inspiration for the designs and materials she uses in her jewellery creations. Fossilised ivory, silver, gold and richly coloured stones are creatively designed to make stylish jewellery inspired by animals, people and the natural Alaskan environment.This is a beautifully put together coffee table book to read, learn and enjoy."
2,Annoying cage to assemble,"Although my 5yr old son really enjoys playing with the hulk figure, the cage is a pain to assemble and keep track of. In itself, not worth it!"
3,Not for the kitchen,"There are cookbooks for the kitchen, and cookbooks for the coffee table. This is in the second category -- pretty photos, glossy paper, and well-written introductory-level information about India and Indian cooking. BUT ... the index is totally inadequate (a major flaw for a serious working cookbook), and the recipes insufficiently well kitchen-tested. If you want something decorative, this is fine; if you want to cook, there are much better choices."
3,Bad acting,Master P directed this movie however he did not have a big part of being in this movie that sucked. Silk wants to be a rapper his girlfriend is framed for murdering a cop. Silk does whatever he can to go undercover and clear his girlfriends name. The only time Silk acting was good in this movie was when he was in the hospital crying for real right before his girlfriend died. The action was not all that bad especially when Silk was in that car driving all around in circles away from the cops and land into the water.
3,could have been good,"This film isn't a classic and it damn sure aint nowhere compared to ""Belly"", but it is watchable. The main problem is the action. This film would've been a story about love, loss, and revenge, but instead the story is almost unrecognizable because of all the long car chases, shootouts, and bad lines. There are good parts though and that's mainly because of the effect it has on people. You feel terrible that an innocent, pregnant woman is beaten to death and that the main character is forced to work for tricky cops."
4,"Much better than I expected, the best NO LIMIT film","I was surprised when I saw this movie, I bought a used copy really cheap and the last movie I seen with Snoop Dogg at the time was URBAN MENACE which I rented and was hugely dissapointed but this was an actual movie and everybody seems to do there best to make sure that it won't turn up on the same page as I GOT THE HOOK UP which was a really bad No Limit Film...The movie is made with cheap camera systems so the camera work might not be Hollywood-class, but the movie itself is very entertaining and SILKK THE SHOCKER is prob. the best actor in the NO LIMIT family...A warning though to the people who wants to see it only becouse of SNOOP DOGG, his screentime is about the time that METHOD MAN had in belly and NAS had in TICKER so u can't really be thinking that I wanna watch it becouse Snoop is in it cuz he's not in it too much... However the movie is very entertaining (Not as good as Boyz N The Hood or Menace II Society but which films are?)"
2,broke on the 3rd use,"this thing broke on the 3rd use, it seemed nice while the handle was still there though."
4,Mix Mizer not totally accurate,I noticed that the quart and liter markings line up. The liter should be five percent bigger. I tested the markings with teaspoons and measuring cups. The embossed lettering is pretty accurate when the extension tube is used. I made my own marks with a Sharpie for future reference. The black labels seem to use more oil than necessary.
2,small - must fill syringe >3 times for 1 gallon mix,"This is just a cheap plastic syringe with a hose to fit on the end. I should have thought it through before ordering and it would have been obvious that this isn't a quick easy solution to mixing since you have to fill and empty the syringe 3 or 4 times to get enough oil for mixing with 1 gallon due to the relatively small size of the syringe. Also, I don't believe it takes the volume of oil in the tube into account, meaning all mixes you make will be somewhat richer than intended.That said, it's better than nothing if you have no way of measuring the oil and want to buy it in larger sizes than the pre-measured mini-bottles. A cheap plastic graduated cylinder of somewhat larger size would be best though, something that will hold around 6 oz total."
1,Good idea but made for single use,This thing is awesome idea but made so cheap! I found it at walmart for $3 and am taking it back!
2,"Works For Mix Ratio, Cheaply Made, Could Be Much Better","I agree with the other reviews who are disappointed with the cheap construction. I recently was using it and accidentally pulled the plunger all the way out the backside and oil got all over the place. It was hard to pull at first and then hit a less friction area and that was it. It is made of all plastic and seems like it could have been made with more quality materials and design. The two finger tabs on the sides of the syringe tube are thin and start to bend while applying pull if you try to use it for any type of heavier oil. It is not a one handed tool. It could have been if it were higher quality. It's a shame that there are not more choices in this category as I would gladly pay a few dollars more to get a better made product. Does the job, just not a well as it could be."
4,Conveint,Handy to use for those small tanks where you don't want to add oil to a large gas can. Now you can mix by the Quart or ounces
3,"Great idea, could be implemented better","This little device sounded perfect when I read about it. The problem is that it is made to be as cheap as possible. The plunger tip is just molded plastic, so it tends to leak and is also hard to pull/push. If this product were made ""right"" the plunger tip would be rubberized or have an o-ring seal around it, like all decent syringes. Great idea. Poorly implemented."
1,mixing tool,"This is a joke, dont waste your money on this are muck better out there! nothing in gallons or gallon if you want to suck up the oil you need to pour in something large joke"
1,waste of money,"the finish of item is garbage making it imposible to lide back, i had to use a sand paper to sand the edge that seals in the cylinder, now i can use it but leaks all over, cheap item"
1,Terrible terrible terrible! Don't waste your money,The amount of force you need to use to pull and push this thing is insane! Extremely difficult to use.Quite useless and it's going back to walmart.
1,Waste,"The lack of rubber plunger on this makes it useless. Too hard to pull and push the plunger, marking on the side are way rich anyways."
1,Leaking zerk fittings ruin a good product,"These appear to be solid, well made bearing protectors with one fatal flaw: the zerk fittings leak like a sieve. I've tried three different grease guns (which all normally work well), and none were able to get a good seal to the zerk: the grease just leaked out around the outside of the fitting.The zerk fittings are screwed into a nut: changing them once installed requires removing a snap ring, spring, and pusher plate, then holding the nut while unscrewing the zerk fitting - not a terribly complicated job, but certainly not easy: especially with everything in the vicinity covered in grease."
1,"Looks Good, Works Bad",Item arrived with a lip on the edge that needed to be ground off and polished prior to being able to fit in a hub. The zerk fitting leaks and will need to be replaced prior to being able to use it. The item is chrome polished so it does look good. It just doesn't really function as a bearing protector. It is total garbage. Buy a good one. Leave this one on the bargain shelf.
4,Vintage Randy,"I enjoy Randy, his quriky lyrics and vocal style, this album did not fail to deliver on either account. Very enjoyable."
3,Sail Away! Randy Newman,"sigh . . . evidently no longer a Randy Newman fan. (rememberd ""Short People"" from way back).Blessings to Amazon!"
5,memory,"Had forgotten about randy over the years. Heard ""leave your hat on"" on the radio and pulled up the play list on the internet. It is one of the sexyist songs I've ever heard. I was pleased to find how large a range randy has with his music on this cd; tending a bit toward the early 20th century in flavor and sounding a little like leon russell. love it! Will be adding more of his music to my collection."
5,a must own,masterfully crafted. one of the best albums from the most adept lyricist and satirist in popular music.
1,ZZZZZZZ - Boring!,"This book was so dull, I struggled to get through it. I will be skipping any McCrumb books from now on. I cannot believe how long it dragged on...I was dying for it to just end so I could get some closure!"
1,how many updates to get it to work?,"Have yet to get this to work. Tried installing the software 4 times, running the update feature 3 of those times with no success."
2,Why the hell would Motorola hire a third-party BVRS software,"I have used the software since its early version from V300, V400 to the new V180. the darn thing never worked properly on the V300 and it's probably not the software fault as the phone needed a firmware upgrade. Recently i tried to transfer phone book from one V180 to another V180. It took me update to the latest version and removing all the excessive/unnecessary modem entries from Control Panel | Modems, so that it could finally see the phone the right way. Then after getting into the software and configured it to explicitly use the assigned modem(phone) it finally worked. The whole process took 1 and 1/2 days. With Ericsson software, things were never this messy."
2,For beginners only!,"I have two other tapes by Tamilee and they are excellent. I was disappointed with this video's image quality and the exercises. I would say that I am in the beginner/intermediate stage, but the ab moves were elementary and not challenging enough for me. It's ""intermediate/advanced"" title is misleading. I don't recommend it."
2,For Women Only,"I made the mistake of buying this video. It's probably very good for women, but too easy for men. If your a guy, I'd recommned '8 Minute Abs' or the 'Men of Steel Abs of Steel' video."
5,It was a great video to sculpt you up,"It ripped up every part that I wanted on my arms, and I felt like it was a very great video for advanced arobic people. And it really can make your stomach look all crunched, and ripped up."
4,Laidback,This CD has a real smooth vibe to it kinda of a cross between Raphael Saadiq & Shock-G it takes you on a smooth trip and never let's you down
3,Fair enough !,"Although the album includes good songs and hits, the fact that the ""Orquesta Sinfonica de la Ciudad de Mexico"" played the music was not a very good idea, from my particular point of view. I was expecting the titles to be played in a very similar way to those in the early eigthies, and I got a bit dissapointed. However, there are two or three good songs, such as ""Hoy tengo que decirte papa"" or ""Corro Vuelo me Acelero"" that are great !!!If you can't get the original 1989 Timbiriche clasico, this would be a good choice."
2,Good for an edited version.,"This new version of ""Timbiriche Clasico"" is just okay. The original ""Timbiriche Clasico"", released on 1989 was a lot, lot better than this edited to the max version. It is missing the best song of the album called ""Por ti"", an unreleased song that came out only in this album in 1989. Well, maybe they decided to edited this album because the other one was so long that some people used to find it boring, but I believe that this copy is missing a lot of the good music."
1,This album sucks,"The clasico is not Spanglish for greatest hits. It literally means classic as in classical music. Not at all what I had expected, nor is it anything that die hard fans of old Timbiriche would want."
1,ARGHHH!!! REALLY A BAD MOUSE!,"My old wheel mouse is much much better and precise than this kensington optical mouse. Contact customer support to solve it, tried the right drivers, but the mouse still without precise.Please dont buy it. Choice a Logitech or Microsoft one, because the diammond tech is not good at all. Kessington, try to do more research in optical technology and release a good product."
5,amazing,"most gamer's will go crazy over their peripherals and spend insane amounts of money. as much as i'd like to blow $80 on a Logitech G7, i didn't exactly have that much to spend on a mouse. recommended to me by a friend, i went with this Kensington Mouse-In-A-Box. the wireless range is pretty good, and the mouse doesn't go into sleep right away, staying active for a good minute or so before dimming the LED, then at least another 5 minutes before shutting the LED off entirely to save power. for only a 400dpi mouse(that's what most cheap mice track at) i never had any tracking problems. with my own custom cut and painted plexiglas mousepad measuring 13"" x 18"" i never once had a skip, except for when the pad itself got dirty, but a wet cloth solved that problem."
5,"Yes, I can do this!",I have enjoyed this cook book for years. I just recently gave it as a gift. It has helped me make meals that have pleased me as the cook and my family and friends because they've experienced something different. And good. I never tell people how easy the meal was to fix. My secret.
4,Cookbook,The book was received in a timely fashion and was exactly as described. I am very happy to have another copy as my husband threw out a box of items after our kitchen reno and my cookbooks were in it.Thank you.
5,Thank you,"A classic cookbook, received in great condition. Couldn't have been more pleased to replace the one that I had. Very glad it is still on the market since it has been a favorite!"
1,Mickey Mouse Garbage,"At best, this is good as a child's toy. Even when the rubber was moistened to increase the suction, it did not adhere to a smooth surface long enough to accomplish any chore. The plastic is not of a durable type, and the metal parts, especially the clamping part is very cheap. All in all, even at $9.99, I would say to save your money."
1,You can't purchase spare parts,Don't purchase this product. You can not obtain spare parts for it. The manufacturer and other internet websites do not sell spare parts for this unit.
3,Jean's grinder,"This grinder is OK for what I wanted to do. I've only used it once for grinding chicken, and it did the job, but it needed some extra energy on my part to get everything through. I'm hoping it will get easier as I use it more often. I would say that for the price, it's a good buy.As usual Amazon.com always has what I'm looking for and the free shipping was great and something I always look for when buying."
3,not as good as I would have liked,"The rival grinder is an OK product. I had an old rival grain and food grinder that was superb ! the inner worm was shorter and it really did a fantastic job , this grinder does not push the food out properly , at the end there is still more than half a cup of unground stuck all around the inside and the worm even if I grind some bread to try and clear it, I have only used the grinder on cooked meat."
2,Poor design of Ring Collar,The first time I used this unit the Ring Collar split in half. Obviously the plastic part was defective. In contacting Rival this unit is still for sale on their site but the Customer Support says the part I was willing to purchase is no longer available. What a joke. I now have a usless piece of junk because the company can't supply replacement parts.
1,don't even waiste your time and money,"it is not useable at all. very cheap quality. it can not even grind water, let alone to meat. do not even think to look at it. im returning it."
1,Bad News,"I own 2 of these. Both nearly new. The feeding tube is a plastic type material, and the first one split horizontally along bottom (over time)just forward of where it attaches to the unit. The second one broke at the rear of the feeding tube where it holds the rubber seal, while just sitting between uses. I know this sounds like I abused it, but this definately is not the case. The bad thing about this unit is that parts are not available (that's why I bought the second one).If they start making this unit with a metal feeding tube, it would be a great unit, as the rest of the unit is fine. Virtually all other grinders on the market have metal feeding tubes (and now I know why)"
2,Meh,"You get what you pay for. The grinder is mediocre at best. I used it for grinding chicken breasts and wasn't thrilled. Haven't tried it on pasta.The grinder is made up of cheap parts. It isn't even close to GI Joe proof. I managed to break it on the 2nd use. I spent an extra $20 on a better quality grinder and have been happy since.The product comes with decent instructions and is easy to assemble.If you are willing to be gentle when using the grinder, this grinder will work for you."
2,First item I ever returned to amazon.,"Pro: does grind, although pretty slow.Con:-when it arrived, the plates smelled of machine oil, so I washed and dried it before use. Discoloration appeared on cutting plates after 1 use. Rust started to appear on the large plate even though I wash and dry it right after using. Rust also appear on the metal part of the plastic worm.-Everything is plastic except blade and cutting plate and spring.-meat tends to get into the spring.Its a good machine for the price, if only it didn't rust on me and the plates didn't looked like gasoline floating on top of water. So I made tough decision and add another 100 dollars for the Waring pro on the amazon."
3,not the freshest,Questionable shelf time vs. freshness. Personal experience was only for a weekend before I switched to a xtra cap battery ordered direct from Motorola. I noticed a substantial difference in performance.
1,Not my cup of tea,Very hard to understand and follow. Story was not interesting and no plot. Would not recommend for those you value their money.
1,Boring!!,"My wife, who is Philipina, and I love to watch asian films! But this film was not a movie. It was more like a documentation or someone's own private home video of their life. It was boring! There was hardly any dialog to be spoken of! I was sitting there thinking, ""There is got to be more to this than what was shown""! It was not entertaining! To say the least, we were very disappointed! I'm sorry that we bought it!"
1,Don't waste your time,"There was nothing redeeming about this movie. Ninety minutes were devoted to a few pool halls, a few boat scenes and that was it. Slow, too long and just plain dull. The last 30 minutes took place in the present. Scenes took too long to complete."
5,This is really good movie making,There have been movies where the actors play essentially the same characters in different times of the world. This is different and it is very engaging. It took several watchings to be clear about what was going on and it finally worked for me. Mebbe' I am a bit slow on things. I have a lot of DVDs and Blu-rays and I lend them to friends and this is definitely one of those movies I will recommend to real movie people.
5,Three Times Five Stars,"Three stories, three eras, two actors. My favorite was the 1966 soldier's story. Hopeless romantic that I am I loved the idea of a man traveling to the ends of the ""earth"" to have a modest dinner and hold the girl's hand. The other stories are compelling too."
2,A critic's movie,"This film is a darling of the critics. Roger Ebert gave it four stars, and A. O. Scott of the NY Times describes it, on the DVD's box, as ""a masterpiece,"" adding, ""this is why cinema exists."" That being the case, if you are, or aspire to be, a devotee of cinema, then this film may be required viewing. But if your sensibilities run toward (mere) movies, beware.The film, set in Taiwan and China, depicts three love stories -- set in three historical periods: 1911, 1966, and 2005 -- using the same actor and actress. The problem, simply put, is that ""Three Times"" moves at a glacial pace and little happens. As one of the few critics not to wax euphoric put it, ""if this movie moved any slower it could qualify as a photograph."" When each segment ended, and when the final credits rolled, the question plaintively asked by Peggy Lee came to mind: Is that all there is?"
1,A Testament,"Movies like this serve to remind you that real life is much, much more important--and entertaining!"
2,anything but a masterpiece,"I've seen a lot of movies and read a lot of reviews over the years, and I have never before found a movie that was judged so highly by well-known critics to be so poor. There is a fair amount of visual beauty, including that provided by lead actress Shu Qi. But the imagery amd music are repetitive, the camera work is slothful and uninspired, the music is largely trite and cloying, and the sparse dialogue is alternately trite and banal. good love stories show you why and how the people love each other; these show you neither. I am a big fan of foreign films and I often like films that don't follow conventional formulas, and films paced slowly and without a lot of dialogue or action, e.g. The Silence and Cache. But without much dialogue, action, innovation, or substance, what's left is ""Three Times""."
1,Maybe the most boring movie I ever saw,"If you look at this movie, make sure you do while you are very awake. It is slow and very boring. There's no storyline, the camera shows no notable movement for long periods of time, it is a movie for critics, not for regular folk. Unless you are a film critic, stay away from this. It is NO MASTERPIECE, forgive my saying it."
2,Three Times,"Although the cinematography was beautiful, I found ""Three Times"" to be boring. It is a very slow and deliberate movie. Because it essentially consists of only two characters, there's not much of a storyline. And to be perfectly honest, I didn't find either characters to be that well developed or interesting. I suppose the theme would be how difficult it is to connect with people who we love, but did I have to be told that three times??? (Hence the title of the film.) Many people walked out of this movie--especially during the very long second part. I felt like doing it too, but I wanted to get my money's worth. Unfortunately, I didn't. NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,A haunting film that just won't let go,"""Three Times"" is much more than it appears on first viewing (as I also find to be the case with ""Millenium Mambo""). While little appears to transpire on screen in any of the film's three stories, each segment worms its into your subconscious where they do their work over days, even weeks. There is a haunting quality, especially in the performance of Shu Qi, where she alternately enchants and seduces before, in the end, breaking your heart. In this film she is simply enthralling. What a long way she has come since her Category III days in Hong Kong; in ""Three Times"" she shows herself to be one of Asia's great actresses."
5,Excellent Weed Book,"What is good about this book goes beyond good photos of the weed and helping you identify, it is also fun to read. You really learn about the weed. You learn which weeds you can eliminate by eating and which weeds you really to have to fight against. The only weakness of this book, it doesn't have a key like the more technical, less informative weed book I own. This is actually less of issue than it could be, since I enjoy just reading this book from time to time, but I get no joy from reading the more technical book. Since I reread the whole book, I have little need for a key."
5,MORE PLEASE!!!,"This dvd is amazing! So many hot as hell girls jumping up and down most of them topless. So if you like stuff like Motley Crue, porn and beer you will fall in love with this dvd. I cant stop watching this dvd so many juicy juggs so little time it never gets boring!"
3,Not as great as it sounds!,"This is a good item to pass time if you ave nothing else to do, but it quickly gets repetitive. It may have been better if it wasn't to a christmas carol soundtrack."
5,Up's and Down's,"This was a pretty good DVD, but it definitely had it's ups and downs. When I saw this was out I jumped to order it right away, but there was a bit of fuss because my check bounced. Eventually it shipped and I leapt to watch it."
1,Never received,This item was due to ship right after Christmas but did not arrive. It was then set to arrive 2 weeks later and still did not. I had to write to find out that the order was cancelled due to lack of inventory.
2,Are you guilty?,"If you have incredible guilt over the way you raised your children or have amnesia about that experience, this is the book for you. The authors seem to assume that we all fit the stereotype of 60s boomers and need to remake ourselves as grandparents. From a quote on p 19, ""Through grandparenthood, we are now convinced that we have a reprieve, a dispensation from God. We have another chance to help rear children."" Isn't the role of rearing the children that of the parents?!There are some useful insights in this book, but they are few and far between. Find the book in a library and turn to the resources in the appendix."
4,Very good collection,"This is the only Poco collection to cover their entire career from the early 70's through the early 90's. Most of the best songs are here, including ""Picking up the Pieces"", ""Rose of Cymarron"", ""Crazy Love"", ""Heart of the Night"" and ""Widowmaker"". This is the best collection for introducing new listeners to Poco."

4,Hard to Believe,": ""Hostage of War"" is about a 13-year-old girl, who is a Russian Jew called Tatjana. ""Hostage of War"" is a true story based on Tatjana's diary during the Holocaust. Tragedies happen along the way of Tatjana's journey, but so do friendships, first love, and hatred. The book was very interesting because of all the different places Tatjana has to go because of World War Two. The book was also very enjoyable because it shows and tells what life was like in the eyes of a teenage girl. The book ""Hostage of War"" takes the reader and puts them right in the book and you can really understand what the writer is trying to tell about all the hardships that happened during the time she was growing up."
5,Some Idiot Place the wrong book here -see picture,the picture of the book for this isbn is entirely the wrong book and should be deleted immediately
1,Turgid prose and a tortured plot,This is genuinely one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot is completely improbable and tortured. The characters are one dimensional and undeveloped. The wanton amorality of the main character makes identification with him beyond the realm of possibility. My time spent with Manchee and his characters would have been more productively employed peruseing the manual that came with my dishwasher. I sincerely hope the publishing world will stop inflicting attrocities such as Twice Tempted of the reading public.
3,Not for the ametuer,"This DVD will NOT teach you JKD. If you are already Familiar with it, then it is VERY helpful. I have been studying Jeet Kune Do for about 2 years now, only under Bruce Lee's original style and schooling. You must understand what JKD revolves around. Tao. The way. It doesn't matter how strong your axe kick is, because if I truely know the Tao about any martial art, my effectivity will be much better. Watching Bruce Lee's form is very helpful to realize how JKD looks in fluid movements and in combat situations. However, if you want to learn a martial art, I defenietly suggest buying the Tao of Jeet Kune Do, and after that move on to books on form, then finally go to perfecting motion, etc."
2,Only for collectors . . .,"If you want some footage of Mr. Lee, go ahead & buy this. Otherwise, I can't recommend it."
5,excellent,"excellent book for those enrolled in a program, and will help you in researching and writing papers. A great reference book"
5,The Best,"Very informative text. Packed with loads of full-color pictures. The most complete guide to Mustangs. The book features the options available on these Mustangs from the factory, and features excellent detail on aftermarket parts currently available."
5,One of Paul Williams finest albums.,"Most people are unaware of what a tremendous talent Mr. Williams really is. Many aren't aware of the songs he has written like Evergreen, Time and Tide, Rainy Days and Mondays, An Old Fashioned Love Song, and many more. Well, you can get these timeless favorites and more all in this album. So what are you waiting for? The price is right!"
3,"I sorta expected this ,,,!","I'm a NYC-educated attorney. Butch Karp and Co. have been highly reminiscent of a LOT of old real friends - at least until the last 3 books. It is unmistakeable to me that these last 3 were written by someone other than the writer of the initial dozen or so [the earlier ones are great books, but these latter ones are each progressively more terrible!] If I could give this one Zero stars I would [or, even better, negative stars].In the future, if there are further Karp books (and I tend to think not, unless there happen to be plenty of potential readers out there with completely different tastes than mine), I will read the book first at my local B&N; and only buy a copy if I think it fits into the Karp Kanon and shuld be re-read with the earlier books."
1,Disappointing,"This is pathetic. The author should have simply ceased writing this series after the previous one. I enjoyed the earlier books, but definitely not this one."
2,Not his best work,I liked the earlier works better. This one got into to much international politics. It couldn't keep my mind on it. I was disappointed in it as I had anxiously awaited a new book by him. He didn't have much about Marlene or the kids in it.
2,Not Up To His Prior Standards,"As one who has really enjoyed many of the Butch Karp/Marlene Ciampi books previously, I was very disappointed in this one.The story is so farfetched that it lacks any credibility. The author has the following teamed up as a terrorist fighting team: New York's DA, his loose cannon security expert wife, 'mole people' who live in the underground of New York City, a former Viet Cong fighter and current mobster, a tribal police chief from New Mexico, some Russian mobsters, and Karp's young twin boys.If the composition of this 'team' doesn't reveal the lack of credibility in the plot, and you are inclined to get this book, I would at least recommend checking it out from a library. It is not one that is worth buying. Robert Tanenbaum's writing has gone downhill in a big way."
1,Counterplay,"Well, I was warned and got this book anyway. Calling this another in the Karp/Chiampi series is very misleading. The characters have the same names but thay are not the same characters. In fact this book has such flat characters I almost see it as characterless. It is clear that when Michael Gruber left the farm, so did the characters and writing we all loved. Whatever Mr. Tanenbaum did that caused Michael Gruber to move on - he should apologize and get him back, or end the series. I feel a little like the victim of a fraud by having had this book passed off to me as another ""in the series"". I'm going to buy Michael Grubers's books from now on."
1,How are the mighty fallen,"I have followed the Karp series since the very beginning and indeed own all the books. ""Counterplay"" just does not belong there. Indeed it seems at time as if it was written by someone who never read the series. On page 26 we are told that ""Atop the list of Karp's happiest moments had been his presence at the birth of his three children: Lucy, the eldest, and the twins"" Yet in ""Material Witness"" Karp is far away when his wife, pursued by Mafia killers, finds refuge at neighbors who help deliver little Lucy. I could go on but there would be no point."
3,Counterplay - Tanenbaum Didn't Show,"I have been a great fan of the Karp series and eagerly await each new book. This one seems to lack the intensity the others have. The Karp family is definitely not front and center in this one .... where is the FAMILY! I feel like this book was done just to satisfy a deadline, definitely not a honor to the series."
1,NYC reader,"This is the first and last book I have read by the author. Perhaps his body was taken over by aliens and this book is atypically atrocious -- I cannot help but wonder how it got published? I am more annoyed at myself for buying the book. The characters are almost so cartoonish that I am expecting a Saturday morning animated show -- Marlene, the one eyed crime fighter -- Lucy, the twenty something year old who has visions from a saint and speaks 60 languages -- but from what she says in the book it appears that eloquent english is not one of them. I actually forced myself to finish the book because I thought it could not decline further as the chapters progressed. Alas, I was so horriby mistaken. Anyone want my copy of this book?"
3,cliffhanger,"While this isn't the best of the series it does tie up some loose ends and open some new doors.I have read Mr Tanenbaum had a ghost writer for the early books in this series. That may be the reason for it being a bit disconnected from the early books.This book was the conclusion to a trilogy embedded in a series containing Fury and Hoax.Having read all the books in this series I can say that there isn't a lot of difference in ""Butch"" Karp, but Marlene is a lot more believable now. Marlene was getting to the point where she was such a nutcase and a danger to the populace in general there was no way a guy like Butch could stay with herThis is a series where you have to really suspend your disbelief in many areas; I mean David Grale and his underground minions?These books are for entertainment, I found this one kept me reading very late one night to finish and I will certainly buy the next one to see what happens,"
1,Needs an editor,"I was very disappointed with this book. Besides being totally distracted by the misspelled words and badly placed punctuation, I did not feel this was a ""comprehensive"" guide to finding a nanny. The author spends too much time recalling her own woes in finding and keeping good childcare, and not enough detailing the process for others. This author needs a good editor to re-write this book - there are some helpful nuggets of information buried in this poorly written and seemingly un-edited resource."
5,Great sound,"This band smacks of Tool, both in instrumental and vocal sectors. The song ""Get Away"" is really strong. I would recommend it to all Tool / A Perfect Circle fans."
1,it's not tool they just really reallly sound like them,"when a friend of mine first heard this band, it took quite a lot for us to convince him it wasn't Tool. and that is what this band sounds like. Tool doing songs in predictable nu metal/pop song structures. if you like this, you obviously haven't listened to enough music."
3,An Okay debut.,"Earshot first album ""Letting Go"" is an okay first cd. It has some really good songs on it. Some of the cd happened to bore me though. I think Earshot's second album is 100 times better than their first. It's much more dynamic and just seems to have more interesting music. As for this band sounding like Tool, they do share the style but I don't think in any way are remotely close Tool's level. Maybe Tool just happens to inspire Earshot. There's nothing wrong with that. Tool is an amazing band. Anyway here are my song ratings...1. Headstrong - 9/102. Misery - 8/103. Get Away - 10/104. Not Afraid - 10/105. Ordinary Girl - 9.5/106. We Fall - 9/107. Wake Up - 8.5/108. This World - 7/109. Asleep, I Lie - 6/1010. Unfortunate - 7/1011. My Time - 8/10Grade: 84% B-Anyway It's a good start for Earshot and an alright listen. If your a fan of them you should go out and purchase this cd. Then go purchase their next album called ""Two""."
4,A Great Debut...,"I'm enjoying this CD. Earshot has offered up a great debut with ""Not Afraid"" (my favorite song, by far) and ""Get Away"" leading the charge. ""Ordinary Girl"" and ""Wake Up"" are yummy tunes worthy of purchase. Next up... avoiding the sophomore slump. Earshot can do it."
5,AMAZING New Band!!!,"After being blown away by their first single ""Get Away"", I knew I HAD to have this album. After buying it the day it was released I must say that I am thoroughly impressed. The album is strong the whole way through. My top picks are ""Not Afraid"", ""Ordinary Girl"", and ""This World"". Earshot's ""Letting Go"" is an absolute must-have for any hard music fan."
2,Earshy.,"In a couple of years these guys could be really good. On a whole they are not a bad act, but they need to mature a little and harness their creativity. It would not hurt if they stopped listening to TOOL, however, because the influence DOES shine through. Worth checking out for a decent band in the making."
2,"Other than the single, not much meat.","Earshot has a great single in ""Get Away"" but another than that song, the album just falls short. It was very disappointing to hear, especially when the single gave the band so much promise. I will admit the fact that his voice sounds like a fetal Maynard James Keenan (although lacking variety and power) is a very good feature about this band. But other than that, they just don't have what it takes. The rest of the album is very repetitive and mediocre at best. Maybe this band has a future, maybe they don't. The single shows promise, what they do after this will show everyone what kind of a band they really are."
4,Get Away,"...Earshot's ""Get Away"" started playing, and when the chorus started up, all I could think was ""Tool or Perfect Circle has a new album?? Did Maynard James Keenan sing wiht another band??"" No, no no, Tool fans. It is just Earshot. Scratch that. It's Earshot, one of the best new rock bands to come out of the melting pot. Sure Puddle Of Mudd and Nickelback (I know Nickelback isn't a new band, but they're ""new"" to popularity) are great, but Earshot is better."
2,Get your own sound.....,"And just why would I want to listen to a watered down Tool [copy] when I could just go listen to Tool? This is just another attempt to [copy] a great band's sound and make it more pop-friendly, just like Incubus did to Faith No More. But at least Incubus has some redeeming value(They did put out that non-commercial SCIENCE). I've read some reviews that say Earshot is different from Tool because it isn't as complex and it's easier to get into. That doesn't change anything, folks. Why do we need a more radio friendly Tool, when the original is so much better? Go get Silverchair's new album instead, or The Used's debut or Glassjaw's new CD, and see if you like those any better. I don't buy this for one second."
4,not tool!,first...not tool! not even close. i dont understand the comparison people make between the two. but this cd offers alot considering the music that is out there now days. great music and thought provoking lyrics make this cd worth buying. it is one of the best hard rock cds i have bought in a long time.
3,A poor mans Tool,"Any band that trys to sound like Tool in an industry of Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, and Kid Rock, is ok with me. I found this cd for 8 dollars. I was definatly willing to pay 8 dollars for a cd that could potentially be of some quality. After listening to it I think it is only worth 6 dollars. To be blunt the guitar is not as good as Tool, the drums are not as good as Tool, Vocals are better than Limp Bizkit but not as good as Tool. I think ""A perfect Circle"" is coming out with some news stuff eventually. Save your money for that."
3,Not TOOL but not bad either,"Okay, so I'll admit that my number one reason for getting this CD was because of the track that most sounds like TOOL, Misery, and yes it's a great song but I somehow expected more TOOL sounding songs, what can I say? I'm not getting enough of TOOL.So, I listened to the CD once and wasn't too impressed, I figured it was because I expected TOOL (not possible) anyway, after throwing it back into the deck and listening to it a couple more times, I decided that it wasn't half bad, there is some good music here and it's worth listening to. Just don't expect them to replace TOOL."
4,Cool CD!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'm listening to this cd right now. it's VERY good, but they're obviously copying tool.....the whole cd flows together very well like tool's but the guitars sound kind of awkward...they also sound very much like an earlier deftones. if you like tool + deftones + kittie's weird guitars then get this!!!! their gonna go a long way i can tell!!"
2,I changed my mind,"When I first reviewed this album two years ago, I gave it a glowing reviews. Unfortunately, the album doesn't have too much lasting value. They initially impressed me due to the vocalist's similarity to Maynard James Keenan, but the novelty of that wore thin quickly. The band doesn't have too much aside from that to back them up, leaving a rather average nu-metal band. If they worked at developing a more unique sound, there's definite potential for greatness. But as of this record, that potential is far from fulfilled."
1,I honestly forgot these guys even existed.,"I was at karaoke last night and I was flipping through the book for music choices when I saw ""Get Away"" by Earshot and I was like ""Whoa, those guys actually existed! I forgot about them!""So with that said, I have no problem reviewing old stuff so here this goes.This CD isn't bad the way a bunch of no-talent hacks are. These guys at least have the requisite ability to play their instruments. It's the overwhelmingly embarrassing lack of originality that crippled any attempt for credibility in the music community. I mean, if they didn't simply record a CD and market it to the industry, if they actually played out and played live, could have ANYONE told them to maybe not sound like... well if you haven't figured it out by the other reviews, I guess I can't help.But yeah, the songs on this album sound largely like leftover Tool riffs and generic rock. Not a fan."
4,Tool? nah--,"i keep hearing that earshot is alot like tool. i wouldnt say that. they do kindof sound alike, but earshot is most like staind. i know you may not think so at first but--if you buy dysfunction by staind and this album also, you can actually hear the similarities between some of the melodies in these albums. personally, i think that's kind of cheating. they basically stole some of staind's melodies and changed them around minutely and called them their own. so its really not that original. if you want a really good alternative album--buy dysfunction."
4,it's an ok cd,"ok, so the one song they played on the radio could have been mistakend for tool. big deal, when I got this cd, I knew it wasn't tool, and surprise, it doesn't sound like tool. it sounds like they have tool's influence, but so what? People used to think that tool was heavily influenced by pink floyd. doesn't change the fact that they made their own unique sound. Earshot is a decent band, as far as modern rock bands go. if you like the tool-style, or actually rock in general that has deep lyrics, you'll like letting go. the only problem i had with it is that it got a little repetitive, but other than that, it's got a few nice songs on it that are worth listening to- ..."
4,don't let go,"i found out about Earshot here at Amazon, and since all the reviews were all about them sounding so much like Tool (one of my favorite bands ever), i decided i'd take a listen to it.i absolutely LOVED it, and i think i would have anyway, even if i didn't know Tool... it's heavy, it has melody, vocals are well balanced.... seems to be a fair alternative to rock theses days.i tried not to compare them with Tool, and i actually couldn't, most of the times. vocals do sound a lot like Maynard's, but lyrically and musically, i found it overall quite different.""misery"" could easily be mistaken for a (great) Tool song, but that's about it."
2,This album blows!!!!!!,"This album sux. All the songs are bad. The lyrics suck, vocals suck, the musics sucks, it's all sux. Don't waste your time and listen to element eighty, reveille, ill nino, 40 below summer, depswa, 3rd strike, or chevelle."
3,Yes they do,"For those who do not say they sound like Tool they have not really listened to them. Im saying they are a carbon copy cause I woudl be wrong. First they lyrics are different to me. Earshots seems to be less complex, the soudn however is somewhat similar. There have been a few articles where they even talk about how they model themselves after Tool.With that said the album is alright, not the best in the world. For some reason it seems to me that most of the songs sound very similar."
1,"Hey, fellas, get an original sound","When I first heard this on the radio I thought it was a new Tool song. I mean, the singer sounds exactly like Maynard and the band sounds exactly like Tool. Then, the DJ said it was some band called Earshot. I couldn't believe a band could get away with ripping off another band's sound so blatantly. Well, Godsmack did it (ripping off the far superior AIC's sound), so why not these guys? I agree wth another reviewer who said this represents yet another all-time low for the music business. Aren't there ANY bands out there doing something fresh and new?"
1,Didn't this band used to be called Tool?,"I was really disappointed with Tool's new album. The music isn't as innovative as it used to be, and they've dumbed down to watered down pop rock. Danny Carey's drumming is horrible, and Maynard sounds like he has a cold. And worse yet, they changed their name to Earshot. How could a band just change their name ten years into their career? Man, this is a huge step down from ""Lateralus"".Waitaminute! This isn't Tool? Man, you coulda fooled me! Actually, it's easy to tell the difference. Tool is a brilliant, original, innovative band, whereas Earshot are nothing but derivative hacks. Danny Carey is the best drummer since Buddy Rich. This guy sounds like he's playing drunk. And, finally, Tool's albums are worth buying, Earshot's albums are not."
2,Good... this sounds nothing like Tool,"This band is alright. Not really my type of music, but alright. I only bought the CD because I was told it sounded very similar to Tool. I tried REALLY hard to hear the similarity, but found them to sound much more like Chavelle. I really don't see how people can say this sounds like Tool at all. They are different in just about every way possible. They are lacking as far as lyrical meaning. I wasn't impressed, whereas Tool's Lyrics seem to lick my soul. There are I believe 3 guitarists in this band, so even structurally they are far off from Tool.For all who keep saying this band sounds like Tool, just stop... although I'm sure this band is flattered by it, they probably want their own identity. And to compare them to a band as musically evolved as Tool is just ignorant."
1,For an exboyfriend,"I bought this for an exboyfriend a long time ago because he liked this band. I am not a fan. First of all, I don't like hardcore because it makes me feel gross. Second"
5,love it,i listened to this cd for 3 weeks straight when I first got it and when i put it on I cant take it out it is my addiction
2,Not his best,"I'm a new fan of Wayne's, but only liked a few songs on this CD. I was a bit disappointed in his choices, but the CD arrived in perfect condition and was shipped very fast to me."
2,Did I read the wrong book?,"After seeing the rave reviews for this book, I couldn't help but be disappointed after borrowing it from the library and reading it.Where were the ""quirky"" characters that everyone loved? While I did enjoy the loving young couple that was having so many disasters trying to refurbish their house and the boyfriend who was just too good for Francesca, I couldn't find them. Yes there were some quirky characters aplenty, just few of them that were loveable.And let's face it. Does anyone actually decide to go into a junky bar to interview a ex-boyfriend that you suspect may have killed someone? How about going to a place that known as being a drug house where weapons are sold? I don't care if you are an intrepid reporter on the trail of a story, people just shouldn't be that stupid and I personally am tired of reading all of these murder mysteries where the women are.Maybe it's for some folks--just not me."
3,Too Expensive,$6.99? I bought the same product (28 fl. oz.) in the dollar section of the local Rite Aid for just that--$1.00!
3,Too Expensive,"I like the scent but it is too pricey. For the same price, I could have got a gallon at Costco. I feel so cheated to pay so much for this on Amazon."
1,Bluescreens Galore,"Using an XP SP2 laptop, the card wouldn't work with a new USB 2.0 device. I tried it with and without the latest drivers provided by ADS Tech. My laptop experienced multiple bluescreens and device lockups. The laptops built-in USB 1.1 works just fine the entire time, it was just slow (as would be expected). I've restored the laptop and am going to try a USB 2.0 card different manufacturer. Two-thumbs down for the DLX-181."
1,Turns screen blue. dumping,I am very upset with this product. Gives me dumping error and/or can not detect either of my external drive; Seagate and Acomdata... Very very upset with this product. BOooo
1,THIS P.O.S. DOESN'T WORK AT ALL!!!,"I could not get this card to work AT ALL on my Compaq Presario 2100. Not the USB, not the firewire, nothing..."
1,im a little disapointed,"im a little dissapointed,because pack of the machine is terreble,machine is good and another thing is some of the parts are missing too,wy?one of the machine have know kool borstel,one of them have know sock,is not a big problem,i put other one,the machine only is a very good,that i want too hear from my costomer........."
3,So-so,"Okay, but far from his best. You get so much background material that you are exhausted before you get to the part things of interest actually happen."
4,"Watched the movie, will watch again. Robin Cook Fan!","Hooked on his literature; even have DVD, and hardback, and highly recommend to everyone.. So interesting and downright captivating. Outstanding-detail is wonderful."
2,"Badly dated, overlong...but great 30 years ago.","At the time this book was a huge hit, unfortunately because it has been copied and imitated so many times in 30 years, it is now badly dated and overlong:1. Too much is made of the woman vs. male profession (laughable now.)2. You need a medical degree to follow a lot of the explanations (although you don't really need to.)3. The book is now way too long given modern sensibilities, some imagery at the end is stunning, but you will figure it out long before the hero.4. Uses and re-uses over worn plot devices: (1) No one believes the hero (2) Good guys are really bad guys (3) Heroine outwits bad guy (4) young doc with great futureAgain, if you look at the old reviews this book was a big hit, but Robin Cook now writes more timely and more economically."
3,"Good, but forgettable","Coma is a good book of the suspense genre with a few flaws. If you read the 25th anniversary author's note at the beginning, you will know why the patients are being put into comas. This took away from the experience and shock value of the ending. However, the plot itself was fast and fun to read. The characters are a little on the shallow side, but were actually quite interesting. The protagonist's actions and motivations are not explained well at all, but this is being picky. Coma came out 30 years ago, so some of the technology is dated, but I found this humorous. Give this book a shot if you are looking for a fast, easy, but forgettable read."
2,I Enjoyed the Movie More,"I normally enjoy Cook's stories, but this one was like reading a textbook, the plot didn't flow well, and I felt more could have been done in regards to the acutal conspiracy of selling organs on the black market. After all, that's the backbone of the novel, and yet, it's explained and over with in the final few pages of the book. Cook's done better."
1,I Can't Believe He wrote this,"I'm sorry, but this was Robin Cook's worst books... It was slow going, boring and more like a TV drama that I don't care about. It was okay for a first novel, but I read more of his recent ones to be an inkling impressed with this one...."
4,Still A Good Read.,"Coma was one of my favorite books of a couple decades ago, and when I revisited it recently I was surprised to find it still quite enjoyable, despite being somewhat dated in terms of the medical technology. That's because good writing lasts a long time. Strong characters, well-developed plot, driving suspense, it's all there.I'm not trained in medicine, but I certainly got the impression that the book was thoroughly researched and technically accurate for its time. I can envision interns, nurses, doctors and other medical practitioners now laughing at how things have changed in the field since Cook wrote it. But maybe that's a reason to read the book. What a great study in the recent history of medicine and hospital procedure. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author or Wake Up Dead."
3,Dated but still revelent,My main complaint about this book is that the ending feels rushed. Otherwise a strong effort.
4,Good Drama.,"This was my first Robin Cook book, and I will be coming back. This is the sort of book you should throw in the bottom of your carry on bag as you head off on a trip, it is great reading on a plane, in an airport, on a bus, on a beach or by a pool. It flows along really well, and it is easy to keep track of what is going on. The drama maintains a adequate and believable pace, and you have to love our heroine, she comes across as a young mans dream; I ended up feeling her pain, and I was cheering when things went well. For a student she stumbled across too much, and maybe that is not realistic, but this is fiction, so what does it matter!"
3,Love Cook but not this one in paticular,"Robin Cook is probably my favorite authour due to his fast paced plots and technical expertise. He does for Medical thrillers what Grisham does for Legal Novels. Coma, however, did not seem overly realistic to me and I found it a little farfetched in places. I prefer his newer stuff I think to this old time best seller."
4,We had to change OR 8 to OR 7A.,I was in anesthesia training when this book and then the movie became popular. We actually had people cancel their surgery if they thought they were scheduled in OR #8. Cook keeps you on the edge of your seat with his graphic descriptions of the OR and the sense of confusion in the doctors involved with the patients who don't wake up.
1,Very cheap,"Very cheap table, falls apart and has to be screwed back together. Looks nice but ultimately poor quality is a nuisance"
4,Not bad for price,"I purchased this set when it was under $80 and for that price it is worth it. It is very light and therefore not the sturdiest, but it is a nice looking set and was easy to assemble."
1,"Horrible, cheap table",This table is cheap and overpriced. The tops of the stools crack easily and quickly. Shipping is expensive and takes way too long to receive. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Shop else where for a better quality table that will last. Save yourself the headache and go with a quality item.
3,was misleading on what I received,"the product did get here in plenty of time, parts were missing and I thought I was ordering the stationary bar stools and received the swivial instead. When contacting the Seller they don't reply to the email. I am not happy with this Seller."
3,retro 3 piece chrome bar stool and table set,looks great - no directions came with it to assemble it though. The seats are for very tall people-only my 6' and taller family use it because the rest of us need a ladder!
4,stylish and functional,"I was looking for a ""retro"" look for our basement. This product has the look and was quite easy to put together. The stool tops do spin."
2,chrome stools and table,The table and stools are ok but the table legs are too straight and it is not very stable. The quality of the top and stools are good.
1,Quality of the product,"I bought differnt stools and they're great but you can tell that these stools and table are of a poor quality. Besides missing some parts to put it together, the foam and built of the stools and table are of a poor quality"
4,Pretty Color,"This has pretty colors in the center glass ball. However, I was disappointed that it didn't seem to reallyreflect the light. I gave it as a gift; to a friend, for her garden. She seems to like it a lot though."
1,Non-SunCatcher Sun Catcher,"This ""sun catcher"" doesn't work. It won't illuminate after a day in the sun. Tried different locations with no luck."
4,GREAT SONG,This song of R.Kelly is a geat song about tha soldiers of war.This song is deep and soulful and is a great tribute to all those men wh have fought for their country.This is a really nice song and I recommend it to all ..God Bless America and Australia..
4,Very Satisfied,Thank you for sending the item as quickly as possible. I enjoyed the CD and it arrived as promised and safe.
3,2nd Best Stories,"This Collection is not the best work of Ray Bradbury, that can be found in ""The Stories of Ray Bradbury"". But instead this is for those who want more or need more of his work. Consider this book the 2nd 100 best stories, good for the most part, some very good, some just average. I gave this book only 3 stars because I found a story in my copy that was missing the ending. I don't know if it is just the paperback version or all versions or just my copy, but the ending of the story TRAPDOOR is left out. The story originally appeared in The Toynbee Convector, which I have. In Ray Bradbury Stories the last page of this story is left out, whether by accident or on purpose I don't know. If anyone knows I would like to hear."
2,MISSING PAGES,I have read Bradbury since the early seventies and looked forward to some re-read. This copy IS MISSING pages 785 through 816. Death and the Maiden is not included in this publication! Thirty pages is not a deal breaker but a real disappointment to me.
2,Not good,I have read Bradbury since I was a teenager and he has written some fine stuff but the stories chosen for this book are definitely his worse ones. These stories would never sell today.
4,...,"Another gift. I bought it for someone as a birthday present.Bradbury is awesome, but his stories are uneven in quality. Some are great, some (mainly his more recent stuff) are kinda' iffy.In any case, ""The Martian Chronicles"" is a much better way to familiarize yourself with Bradbury's work since it's pretty much the best thing he's ever written."
3,Not Great but Good!,"This was my first experience reading stories by Ray Bradbury and I have to say, that after reading sixteen of the stories that so far I'm dissapointed with them, which is why I only gave the rating of three stars. Some of the stories are really boring, and missing that something special that I like to find when I read a book. I don't think I'll try any other books by this author, but there's a hundred stories so maybe I'll read one that I'll love but it's looking doubtful. Too bad because I wanted to like them too."
2,Bradbury should have let someone else choose the stories,"These are not his best stories, with a very few exceptions (Heavy-Set, Ylla, The Man). Most of them are rather aimless, dull, and lack the power of his best works. There are many much better Bradbury collections."
4,Caveat Emptor,"The two stories I really wanted to read and assumed would be included, The Sound of Thunder and Something Wicked This Way Comes, are NOT in this vast collection."
4,A different kind of harry potter,"Wizards hall is a great book, written by jane yolen. thornmallow wants to become a wizard so his mom sends him off to wizards hall. when he gets there, he finds out that he is the last student that will be excepted because they need 113 other wizards to defeat an evil shadow creature. this book is a lot like harry potter. its not as long and personally, i dont like it as much as Harry Potter BUT this is a marvelous book. i think you should rent it from the library then if you really like it, you can buy it!"
1,A rough draft?,"I'm thoroughly confounded by all the five-star reviews for this book. I usually love Jane Yolen, but I found this book very nearly unreadable. It felt like a rough draft for a book, but certainly not like a finished work. The repeated conceit of the teachers being unable to remember Thornmallow's name was utterly weak and pointless. The book is unimaginatievly repetitive and deeply derivative."
4,Intresting. A good tale of wizardry.,"Jane Yolen does very good with this book, a introdution of a school where spelling means creating cats out of thin air and where the grounds grow according to the mood. This is a good book for young readers, especially those that like fantasy and wizardry. I thought that this was a indepth tale of wizardry and accomplishment and that it was very well written."
3,A good book for non-adult readers,"Ms. Yolen created a magical story that was easy to follow. However, I do not think that the characters or stories are developed enough to satisfy adult readers. Of course, that explains why this book falls into the category of Children's books. The Harry Potter craze has resulted in the collision of the worlds of children's books and adult books, and as an adult, I don't know where to turn! (Actually, Edward Eager and Madeleine L'Engle are pretty good.) Wizard's Hall kept me busy for an evening, but I did not take anything away with me when I had finished reading."
3,Wizard's Hall,"All of us have been told by a parent, ""Try your best!"" Young Henry was told the same thing by his mother as she packed him a change of clothes and sent him off to Wizard's Hall to learn magic, spells, incantations and more.Henry arrives at Wizard's Hall, and is dubbed Thornmallow- squishy on the inside, prickly on the outside. Thornmallow however is not very good at magic. He tries his hardest though, because his mother told him to.As the 113th student to arrive at Wizard's Hall, he has been given a strange destiny, though no one will tell him what it is, and talented he is not.Follow Thornmallow on his journey through Wizarding School, and watch as he amazes even himself with what he can do when he tries. Wizard's Hall is a quick, enjoyable read, one that young readers ages 8-11 will enjoy."
3,Same level as Potter? I think not.,"Now, I have read Jane Yolen stories before, and they are usually good...so this one suprised me. It seemed as if Yolen was given an estimate of how many pages she was allowed to use, when her basic plot for herself took about 150 pages. The story seemed empty, but with much potential. I just don't see how this book is put in so many 'If you like Potter' sections of book stores. It just wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I also found it darker then it had to be. If this book was longer, it would have been much better, and probably more popular."
2,No Harry Potter,"I thought this book was boring. Although the writing was welldone, there was no real imagination and nothing to capture thereader's attention. END"
5,delightful trifle,"Although in university, this book remains one of my favourite titles to polish off on Sunday afternoons. Simply written, well-paced, balanced, and charming, it provides an imaginative and refreshing interpretation to some of my favourite themes in fiction."
2,Not like Harry Potter,"I have read that the person who wrote this story compared her story with that of Harry Potter. Not so! There's not even a mention of anything remotely like Harry and, in my opinion, not worthy of the comparison. But, that's just me and my opinion...you should read it and judge for yourself."
2,"A rip off of Harry Potter? Naw, pre Potter","The plot seems to be pretty much the same as the firstHarry Potter: young boy enters magic school and saves the world from an evil wizard. Much of the vocabulary is the same.Characterizations of the friends are even parallel.It is an fairly well written bookand the details are different,but it is recognizable as ""derivative"".But who was first? this one it appears...My original one didn't say it was a ""reprint""of a much older printing."
1,Beware!!,"This is a terrible, boring book. I hated it, my children hated it, everyone hated it. The only explanation I can imagine for the positive reviews on Amazon is that Ms. Yolens must have a few friends who review her books and they must have some alternate email addresses."
2,An Inconsequential Book,"It's an unremarkable but readable tale of a student wizard's first days at school. There are other wizard in training books out there (you may have even read one in a popular series, ahem) but the best is still A Wizard of Earthsea--buy that first, then return for this book if you must. It's not awful, it's mostly harmless, but it isn't her best work.Note: 3 stars, for me, is a pretty good review, 4 is for extremely distinguished works, and 5 only for those I consider classics. Most of what is published is, unfortunately, a 2 or less."
3,Not much of a pleasure to read,"I was disappointed by this book. I had expected a mysterious and seductive novel, but what I discovered instead was rather choppy, inelegant prose that wasn't at all as intense and mesmerizing as I hoped it would be. There's nothing glamourous about this book. As others have said, it's more of a coming of age novel than anything else, and although it does have its moments, it is nothing like I anticipated, and thus was a big disappointment."
4,Sixteen Pleasures,"It will be interesting to see what Nicole Kidman will bring to this role. The author captures the intimacy of the small town that is Florence. The novel is a portal into a woman alone, and the tapestry of cultural wealth that is her environment. This is a warm read and gets my recommendation for an honestly written and competently crafted work. it is interesting that a man can enter the mind of a woman in her portryal."
4,Weaves disparate strands into an affecting comingofage story,"After reading mixed reviews of this novel, I wasn't sure what to expect but perhaps this lack of expectations freed me to enjoy it. Hellenga takes various unrelated elements - book restoration, Italian travelogue, love story, convent history, etc. - and blends them to create an interesting and, at times, moving read. Flaws: 1) occasionally becomes too didactic, with side detours that go on too long; 2) too loosely plotted, 3) sometimes doesn't quite manage to hit the true voice of a woman. The style of the book reminds me of ""Girl's Guide to Hunting .."" in that it feels like a collection of connected short stories, with different points of view and writing styles. Some of the chapters are self-contained, maybe a little too much so. But overall, good writing and an unusual mix of elements."
2,Pedestrian writing,"You'll have to pick your pleasures out of the dross of this very uneven novel. An interesting premise in an evocative setting receives a linguistically dull treatment. In language as plain as blank paper, Hellenga disjointedly hops from family memoir to sociological analysis to romantic adventure to professional exegesis with little sense of cohesion. It's as though he strung together vignettes from a first draft. Characters come and go without much discernable relevance to the story and motivations are murky at best. The best sections deal with Margot's mother's death, the obstacles to divorce in Italy, bidding at auction, and of course the effects of the flood on Florence. If you want a vicarious tour of the city, read Mary McCarthy's Stones of Florence instead."
2,Not at *all* what I was expecting,"Though a fairly interesting introduction to the nuances of book preservation, this book was wholly disappointing. I bought it because it was billed as ""a sensual, life-altering journey of loss and rebirth in this exquisite novel of spiritual longing and earthly desire."" Obviously, the marketing person who wrote this copy read something else. Did I find the book interesting? Yes, but not for the reasons I wanted to."
4,A fantastically sensual book,"Unlike most of the reviewers, I loved this book. While it was not erotic, as the title would suggest, it was extremely sensual in its descriptions of art and Italy. While the main character was perhaps not one that I could identify with, she was very engaging, as were most of the characters. The descriptions were given both through her eyes and the authors, which while confusing, gave the novel a duality that was intriguing. If anything, read this book for the ending auction scene. My heart was literally racing throughout the scene. I have never had such a physical reaction to a book as I had to this one."
4,A virtual trip through Florence,"Hellenga's first novel, unlike his disappointing and overwritten ""The Fall of a Sparrow,"" is a likeable and sweet look at the late coming of age of Margot Harrington, a book conservator. Packed with fascinating detail about books, art and Florentine culture, the book reads like a love letter to Italy.I had a bit of trouble with the love interest, Sandro. Why would he return to his wife after being separated for 10 years? And the ""Sixteen Pleasures,"" while hinted at broadly, are never explained. This is a cheat, especially since the book gets its title from the provocative erotica.Still, the heroine is a strong and heady presence and her encounters with the nuns of the convent are nothing short of inspirational. Hellenga wraps it all up in a quick-moving mystery of sorts. This is a fine acheivement for a literary novel."
4,sixteen pleasures is a pleasure,I love books that are not only a good yarn but from which I learn something. Art history interests me and this novel engrossed me not only for the story but for the art and restoration content. I read it a long time ago but I ordered it for a young friend of mine who is getting a degree in art history.
5,"Erotic, Intriguing and Fun!","This is an absolutely wonderful book!!!The story is about a 'mud angel', a young woman who travels to Florence, Italyin the 1960's after the Arno floods, in order to help conserve and bind preciousbooks that have been damaged by the flood. While in Florence, she comes acrossa rare, erotic manuscript that becomes symbolic of her own life.This novel is erotic, erudite, intriguing and fun for anyone who loves books. It isvery well written. I had trouble believing that it is a first novel. I eagerly awaitmore books from this author."
4,It's worth the trouble,"It had been a while since I read this, but am clearing my shelves for new books. I remeber liking it a great deal- but of course Florence is one of my favorite places on earth, and a wonderful place to be in love. In another copy of this that I had on my shelf, a previous reader had marked this passage (typos are my own;-))""Which of us doesn't have a similar ghostly double wandering around somewhere out there in the big wide world? A self from whom we parted company long ago, at some unlikely crossroads? But do we ever encounter these ghostly selves? Do our worlds ever intersect? I can't believe it. The one is too impermeable, the other too fine, too subtle.""I also may never hear the phrase ""Non vale la pena"" ( It's not worth the trouble"")again without chuckling and thinking of Margot's "" Non vale il pene""."
3,Doesn't quite work,This book felt very choppy to me. It started well but the coming of age story was interrupted by long and highly technical digressions into restoration techniques. I thought important plot shifts were accomplished with one or two sentences and therefore did not feel believable. The heroine often felt flat to me. Nice moments and fine feel for Florence but disappointing overall
4,Not just for lovers of Italy,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, as did everyone I've given a copy to. I expected a bit more of an erotic flavor but actually ended up being most fascinated by the sensual descriptions of the chemistry and art of book restoration and art preservation. The plot is simple, the mood quiet, and the climax intentionally a bit anti-climatic. But this book, like its characters and old Italy itself, has a subtle but irrestible charm. I found myself not quite sure why I loved it so much. But I loved it anyway."
4,A twist on the American abroad story and a lesson in book re,"A young woman heads to Italy on a whim to help salvage and restore the ancient books that have been damaged by floods. The story takes place in 1968, but it is timeless. The erotic tale of a woman finding herself in a foreign land, through love, religion, and work, is interesting and informative from start to finish. The protagonist, Margot, is assisting in the rescue of a convent's library, living among the sisters, when they discover an ancient volume of the Aretino, a sort of medievil Kama Sutra, with original illustrations of sexual positions, bound inside a religious manuscript. The point of view of a young woman is convincingly rendered by author Robert Hellenga, and the story has much to teach about Italy, and the art of book binding and restoration. An enjoyable read, if not top-notch writing."
3,Interesting restoration angle - flat characters,"Although Hellenga's book is very readable, I did not find the characters terribly compelling. Our man in Florence (Sandro) doesn't pan out (hey I sure wouldn't loose any sleep over him). At times I was swept up in the narrative only to be disappointed by the plot's awkward turns. The book restoration angle is really the best part of this read. So... there are some good parts, but I wouldn't avidly recommend it to friends (especially female friends - the negative reviews are right on that score. Many other male writers have illuminated feminine emotions with much greater depth and accuracy)."
3,Flat and a bit obtuse,"I was really disappointed in this book. I had expected something along the lines of The English Patient...something transcendent. I found the ""pleasures"" to be flat and really dull. The writing had little spark, and I agree with the reviewer who felt that the Margot would never had acted or thought the way she did....it is a male based shallowness that guides her through a particularly feminine experience. I got really tired of the lists of three metaphors...especially when they were relative to baseball and bowling."
2,Not what I expected.,"After reading the book's summary, I was prepared for an evocative, lush, story that would draw me in with it's sensuality. But I felt very little sexuality in either of the characters, and less so in Hellenga's portrayal of the book and it's secrets. Although the technical description of book restoring was interesting I found the characters to be flat and difficult to identify with."
2,not quite a waste of time,"Mildly entertaining. Likable character but not fully developed. Many characters are introduced with no ""meat""; flat one dimensional. Many areas or themes are touched upon but never explored. The idea of a person trying to find oneself is exciting; however, the author didn't complete the journey. The premise had so much potential. It never bloomed"
2,All too realistic,"The story itself, I found boring. I didn't care what happened to most of the characters, and cared only mildly about Margot. I did find the insights into Italian culture and book conservation very interesting, but it barely made it worth it. I typically like books the have a sense of adventure to them, and I bought this book because it sounded like the plot would have that. The overall plot was quite normal, in the sense that it could happen to anyone. I like books to take my away from the normal world and this just didn't do it for me."
2,"Strong on information, weak on story","A rambling and disjointed book, this has many fascinating moments but never hangs together. The descriptions of book conservation are well done and interesting. The author has failed, though, to assemble any believable characters. His effort to assume a woman's voice fails miserably and in the midst of the well-researched text, one searches in vain for a plot."
1,Don't bother,Plot? What plot. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Even the sex scenes were mundane. Populated by a gaggle of one-dimensional characters & false starts striving to waste the reader's time.
3,Took Me Two Months to Read,"Unlike other novels I have read in the last year, I couldn't get the momentum to read past the portions that bogged down. For me, this area had to do with life in the convent. My interest also flagged when Sandro, the middle-aged lover, returned to Rome. His efforts to save works from the Uffizi Gallery were the most interesting portion of the book.On the other hand, this is an entertaining book that can be quickly read in a weekend, if you have the time."
1,"boring, boring, boring...","There was not much to grab onto in this book. Sounded like it could be juicy, new love, Italy, erotic art... but it failed to be much more than a boring book about a boring book.The author totally failed in his attempt to write from a woman's perspective. Utterly unconvincing.The main characters were little more than average and their ""forbidden love"" was dry and unmoving.The only interesting parts were the chapters on convent life. Those parts were, unfortunately, too brief.All in all, the book dragged, the characters were incomplete, the descriptions of Italy were fairytale at best. Don't waste your time."
5,A great novel...,"When I look back on thr books I've read in the past ten years, Robert Hellega's ""The Sixteen Pleasures"" is near the top of my list of irresistable, poetic, life affirming books. Forget for a moment that a man can write so effectively from a woman's viewpoint, forget the lush Italian locales (and Hellenga's skill at painting them); this at bare bones is a well written coming-of-age story. Parts of it brought tears to my eyes; I hated going to bed and knowing I had to wait 24 hours to get back to it. That's what makes a good book, and this is one."
3,Love and Books,"Liked it very much. Modern Florence, as opposed to the 15th century Florence in which I had been spending time. Love it when books reference places which I can recall visiting. Lots of good stuff about book conservation. A good love story that seems almost incidental to the rescue of Florentine art treasures. And an unexpected, but satisfying, finish. That, for once, leaves the impression of a life unfinished, perhaps just beginning."
3,Disappointed,"Cute book, but not much math value. Steven and Todd are cousins with opposite personalities, and that's where the fun comes in. Steven likes everything even-numbered, but Todd prefers odd. Todd is even drawn oddly, with odd accessories and habits, while Steven is drawn straight-laced. Cute, eh?The book was better for showing the adjectives ""even"" as ""measured and orderly"" versus ""odd"" as ""off-kilter and zany"" than for showing the math values.But the kids enjoy reading it. We'll keep it, it's just not what I was hoping for."
3,Great Picture! The Sound is Warbly during solid-colored screen transitions.,"I tried resolving this [sound] issue with Panasonic to no avail. From researching and trouble-shooting to actually chatting (during their business hours), I tried it all. There are many references to this issue online; look it up first! I've heard of a mysterious update or fix, but so far it's mostly legendary. I doubt I will go down this street again when it comes to a big money ticket item."
5,Wow! God is great & so is this album!!,"Love the stories and the songs...makes one feel very close to God. A must have for every Christian. Great to listen to on the way to work or when need an uplift. Also great music to walk to in the outdoors...Brings back memories of ""becoming like a child"" to love God like we should. Layton has a great gift he uses to bring glory to God. Fantastic music. Get it!!"
1,Ragtime,"I thought it was the movie, so, this was my mistake however, to listen to Randy Newman for more than 0.5 seconds was freakin' torturous and painful, so much so, I no longer wanted the movie even though my son was in a major part for the Ragtime play."
3,NOT AS HEARD IN THE FILM,"I love the 1981 film Ragtime and the music that Randy Newman composed for it!! Hovever, I did not like this soundtrack!! The titles are the same, but not the musical performances. This is most evident with the piano solos. A good example of this is the simplification of the piano solo used on the track Clef Club No. 1. It's not as heard in the film. Also, many of the musical numbers didn't have proper introductions or endings as heard in the film. Still, worth 3 stars for effort."
3,This is a good Rag time Cd,This is a good Rag time Cd . The music and singing on this Ragtime Cd is one of the best
5,randy's Best,"i have been turning a grooved vynyl disc into a flat plastic surface for the past 20 years playing this over and over. since his first album randy has always stung my heart a little....but with the warm notes on this soundtrack, i am always stopped....over and over.....and now it's on cd!!!!....i have recently been going thru chemo-therapy and this tape is what i listen to during treatments. it's a friend, it's a soundtrack to life......perfect in every way. too bad this man had to wait so long for his rewards. he should've been getting them all along. ""one More Hour"" makes the entire cd worth it all.......randy, thank you"
2,Not a complete waste.,"About the only good thing you can say about the movie is that it has a song or two worth hearing. ""I Will Show The World"" is good. So is ""Magic Mystery Show"", though it has no reason to be in this film."
1,may of 32,"Basicaly their worst effort (and that's all it was, an effort)They tried to build or expand on their sound, or do something bad on purpose or something. It doesn't sound anything like their old stuff; and the new? Whatever."
4,"June of 44 continue to evolve and amaze on ""Anahata""","I have to disagree with the previous two reviews. Yes, ""Anahata"" is different from the previous four releases. I would have to contend, though, that each of the previous four releases have been different from the ones preceeding it. ""Anahata,"" to me, is just another step. I think the vocals aren't lackluster, they're just tired of doing the same vocals over and over. On ""Engine Takes to the Water,"" only Sink is Busted showed any sort of ""singing."" But they continued to experiment with singing, and other vocal styles. Freddie Erskine's trumpet is incredible on ""Anahata."" I'll agree that Boom sucked on ""Anatomy of Sharks,"" but it rocks here, with Fred's voice (I think, maybe Sean's) taking on almost Perry Farrell proportions. ""Anahata"" is an intriguing listen. The sound itself is sleek, and the songs never cease to surprise and please. This is, of course, my humble opinion."
3,Math rock's most dubious,"June of 44 are amongst the most puzzling bands within the Chicago scene, alienating and reinforcing their fan bases between albums, and sometimes between songs. 'Anahata' is probably their most breezy record, lacking the aggression and speed that made 'Engine Takes to Water' such a compelling record. This makes the album a poor starting point for any person wishing to get into this group, or into the post-rock/math-rock scene, and many listeners may switch off at the first whiff of the off-key wavering vocals which open the album opening tracks. But it is worth persisting with, for from this point onwards the album settles in a gentle, pleasant hum. Easy-going indie rock from Chicago, yet again."
4,Growing on me...,"At first I was surprised when the vocals kicked in on Wear Two Eyes, and I must admit I skipped ahead to track two, then three. Cardiac Atlas is what did it, then Southeast of Boston. When I finally listened to the album all the way through, I realized June of 44 has taken another great step forward. The vocals are languid, almost lazy, but they work well with the music. Scharin's excellent drumwork keeps everything together as the guitars and bass wander around. This album has a very relaxed feel, something that was only partly there on Four Great Points. If any of you actually care what people like us think, and have read all the way down to this review, just buy it."
3,Going Back,"I ordered this for my dog to travel to NJ. She wants to stand the whole way and needs to be secured. The straps do not allow her to stand, they forced her to sit. And when we had to quickly hit the brakes, the carrier did stay in place, but the straps came loose and she flew out of the bed while still partially attached. it scared me. The bowl is a good idea, but it doesn't actually fit as they show it and it doesn't secure. So that part is actually worthless. My dog is part Pomeranian, sorta tall and only weighs 14 lbs. For a smaller dog, this might be fine, but definitely not for a dog over 10 lbs. I would actually say more for a miniature dog. Shipping was great and quick and so far the return seems easy, with them providing the return tag."
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!","If I could give this zero stars, I would. It is a terrible pet seat.The sheepskin cushion is thin and provides no support at all. The cushion also slips very easily; it does not take long for the cushion to end up in the floor. The straps that are meant to secure your pet slip free from seat, and the clasp is terribly difficult to use.I absolutely hate this car seat. Do not waste your money!"
3,"Good, but...",the car seat is a pain to take in and out. If you are someone who often has to remove this for passengers than this seat becomes a huge hassle. The dogs did enjoy it and it seemed stable to me.
3,Puppies can see out the car windows,"This product was pretty much what it said it would be. Maybe not as sturdy as I would have liked, but it does the trick. My puppies can see out the car windows and they stay put, which is a must for me. Would recommend for a small dog. Product says up to 40lbs but I can't imagine putting a dog that large on this seat."
3,"Good, Not Amazing","We got this to replace a previous car seat purchase for her. On a difficulty scale of 1-10, I'd say installation is about a 4. It's made for a back seat, which is nice, a lot of dog car seats can only be installed in the front passenger seat. The straps that hold the dog are awkwardly placed and force the dog to sit or lie down, which bothers my dog. She rejected the sheepskin pad and prefers just the plastic. The storage bin is nice, but the legs aren't very stable unless you stuff something inside them to hold them erect.It's just okay for what it costs."
4,Great doggie car seat!,"I bought this doggie car seat because my little Pomeranian was jumping and falling all over the car when I drove. It seems perfect except that I can't figure out how the straps go on! With the side straps in place, my dog just got hopelessly tangled up, so now I just clip the back strap to his collar. I wish the product had pictures to show how to strap the dog in."
4,Nice product.,"This is a very nice product. My reasoning for 4 stars is that the belt clip and the video stand compete for space on the case, and the belt clip has to be screwed in which requires some stretching of the case. And the kickstand may require some adjusting to get it to stand straight and the antislip pieces might need to be moved towards the center of the stand. Otherwise the case is just as described. It's not to slick but it isn't sticky either. I'd recommend keeping an LCD screen protector under the plastic protector provided for extra insurance. The protector doesn't glare too badly though which is VERY nice. Otherwise I love this product, it slipped on well and fits like a glove. Something else that I noticed was that the clip holds well to whatever you clip it to. It stays on things well, but can be removed without unscrewing anything, it's a very nice feature."
3,qclee,"This guide provided alot of history to Thailands landmarks. If you are into dwelving into the history of a country, then this guide is for you. There were many beautiful photos of the various palaces, cities, artifacts, etc. The most helpful part of the book were the practical tips on what to expect while traveling to this country (weather, currency, shopping, festivals, lodging, cuisine, attractions, sightseeing, beaches, emergency numbers). I found the travel tip portion of the book very indepth. There is also a map in the book where you can see the different roads."
1,Would like to give 0 stars,"Waste of money.I THOUGHT I was buying the Insight Guide, not the Insight ""pocket"" guide. The Insight Guide is a worthwhile guide. Be careful when you buy and don't waste your money on this."
4,Hulk smash puny humen!,"I got this toy a few months ago and you can play with it and use it for looks. But if you don't like Hulk you are not gonna want this, but if you do like Hulk you will want this. Amazon.com can give you free shipping. So by it there. It's so cheep!"
3,"Great ideas, no follow through...","This album is good, except for one thing: it isn't finished!!There aren't really any true songs here. There are some great ideas that would make good songs, but just when you start to groove on a beat and a riff...it's over. And most of the tracks are just that - a beat and a riff; that's it. I like it, and C7 definitely has some talent, but the songs, IMHO, are incomplete, and the album comes off sounding like a great producer's musical sketchpad, instead of a great producer's full-length album."
1,$600?,I've seen this television at many Wal-Mart stores for under $500. Why would anyone want to buy this television for $600 + shipping here?
5,Great TV for the price,"I needed a high definition TV for my PS3, and this is the one I settled on. I was torn between a 22"" Samsung and this one. Over all, I think the Samsung was a better TV, but this one was a little bigger, and had more features, and cost $40 less. I bought it, took it home and had it set up in no time. It was quite easy to configure, and over all, I'm quite happy with the picture."
1,Throw Away item,"If you're the type of consumer who buys a new TV every year, then go ahead and buy this one. It won't last any longer than that anyway! The picture goes out - completely gone - with only a couple of vertical flickering bars of blue & red. Great if you're high on drugs - not great for watching regular programming. We're not the only one with this unresolved issue - Google the internet to see the rest.I will never buy another Sanyo product."
4,What a Fun Read!,"I was looking around the house for a few good ""beach reads"" to take on vacation and happened upon this book I bought a few years ago for just such an occasion. Thinking that it would be a fun piece of fluff I could pick up and put down between swimming and playing with the kiddos in the sand, just a few pages in, I quickly realized that I would be spending the next day or so camped out and not doing anything else until I finished this engrossing and thoroughly researched novel. Mann's characters are rich and fully developed, and the story glides along without any of those boring parts that you have to get through to get to the good stuff. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery, old Hollywood, or 20th century history -- you won't be disappointed!"
1,Just awful!,"What were those other reviewers thinking??? Great idea, horrific execution. The characters are ridiculously 2-dimensional, without a genuine characteristic among them (a HIV-infected, former porn star? Give me a break!!) The writing is an embarassment -- when the author is not using every cliche known to man he's ridiculously mixing his metaphors. And he has taken every overused plot devise he could possibly think of -- AIDS, murder, competition between brothers -- and thrown them all together as if this were some kind of literary blender.There's nothing I like more than historical fiction. But a work as inept as this can't even be enjoyed for its entertainment value. Skip it, skip it skip it!!"
4,Motor home instalation,"Directions could have been clearer, customer assistance was confusing. Once the problems were worked out the product fit well, a quality product that works well."
4,The human background to history,"The Cathars have been skipped over too often in medieval histories. These people had the courage to hold to ""heretical"" personal beliefs."
5,Love ..Love..Love..It !!,I live at the Lake & trust me this is with me when i travel to remind me of home. Its total relaxation you cannot go wrong with this one.
4,Very Relaxing!,"Wonderful music & nature sounds for relaxing, massage, or meditation. Perfect escape after a hectic day!"
5,Sounds like you are just there at the lake,This is such a great cd. The sounds are crystal clear and you can just picture your self at the lake side relaxing on the beach. Sooo soothing.
5,This is what the south needs to listen to,"The geto boys is what the south needs, not wack rappers coming from the south making the game look awful. i bet you Webbie or Bun B has never even heard of the Geto Boys or Scarface. if i ever were to tell webbie about scarface hed probably tell me, ""O yeah scarface was a good movie"""
5,Three Kings,"The Steping stones for the south is back bringing what we all miss that mellow type gansta musicIf YOU AINT feeling these Dudes MAN I GUESS YO MIND PLAYING TRICKS ON YOUSTOP HATING ON DA SOUTH ""BDP87 KRS"" AND YOU WONDER WHY WE ACT THIS WAY I GUESS BECAUSE OF NIGGAS LIKE YOU ---HATA MAN"
3,Not bad for a first greeting card program,"My five year old likes to create cards with this program, but I found it to be very limited and to produce mediocre quality cards. For a kids' greeting cards program, it's not too bad."
4,Overlooked But Quite Good,"While in parts this album sounds ""Floydian"", David Gilmour here actually resists the temptation to ""sound like Floyd"" and allows his own talents, including the melodicism and the musicianship he brought to Pink Floyd, to shine in this solo effort. Actually after a few listens I find this to be almost as good as ""classic"" Floyd albums such as ""Animals"" and ""The Wall""- and although it is not as ambitious or as literate as those works, it is also more instantly accessible and enjoyable. Even the much maligned ""Blue Light"" is decent, while songs like ""Murder"" and ""Love on the Air"" have great melodies and great guitar solos too. This album is also better than the records ""his"" Pink Floyd lineup would subsequently record. While Gilmour certainly contibuted much to the Floyd and shows it well here, he seems to do better when not trying to do his version of a Floyd record. Unfortunately, since this record does not appear under the ""Pink Floyd"" label, it was (and is) overlooked."
3,Mmmmm . . . Dave Gilmour - About Face . . . sweet . . .,"If you're standing in the record store (or anywhere else) with a copy of _About Face_ in one hand and _A Momentary Lapse Of Reason_ in the other, trying to decide which one to get, get _About Face_. This is a sensational album, which helped me notice, even more, what I was missing out on with Pink Floyd's/Roger Water's ""The Final Cut"" album, released the year before.I find the fast music uplifting, the slow music inspiring, and the lyrics insightful.Although this album prooves a name (Pink Floyd) sells better than the product (About Face); if I had five albums like this one, I could get rid of my 27 CD strong Pink Floyd collection.P.S. Dave looks quite good on the cover, too!"
4,4 1/2 stars.,"unlike mr gilmour's other two solo efforts, which more favor the tone of ""dark side of the moon,"" this 1984 release has more of a ""the wall"" vibe to it, with heavy synthesizers, keyboard work, and organ coloring the whole affair. which ever you prefer, all three of his albums are a must for fans of pink floyd. the highlight on this record, i feel, is the great instrumental ""let's get metaphysical,"" which has an anthem like feel to it. ""murder,"" is another standout track, which starts out as a ballad, then breaks out into guitar fireworks at the end. ""blue light,"" with pronounced synthesizers and horns is also a powerful track. the whole thing is wonderfully done, actually. you can't go wrong with this if you are a fan of floyd, or classic rock in general."
3,About halfway good,"Your search likely led you here looking for more great music by the guys who brought you Pink Floyd. Don't get your hopes to high like I did those many years ago. David Gilmour is great guitarist and mediocre songwriter - nothing he's put out as a solo artist or as the leader of the post-Waters Pink Floyd lite would make you think otherwise. It's very similar to ""A Momentary Lapse of Reason"" in many ways, but he's at least trying to make it on his own here. Both this album and ""AMLOR"" are very listenable, but they're not the desert island discs some of these reviews make them out to be."
3,If you based your ratings on.....,".......how often you listen to a record/CD, how would you rate it then.I would have to say I listen to this release, once a year and why is that? There is some great moments here. I love Murder and Near the End.....those 2 alone are good compositions. The problem is....I don't think this is a complete album. Just like Roger's solo stuff....there are those contributing misses which make the Pink Floyd solo material fall short. No different with Division Bell and Momentary...lots of hired on help to try to continue the Magic......but it doesn't work.If you rated this 5 *'s, then you must think it stands up well with other Pink Floyd classics.......like The Wall and DSOTM. I like this release....but don't insult anyone's intelligence by thinking its a MUST!!"
2,Pink Floyd fan's (like me) be honnest please,"Hey, I'm a Pink Floyd fan, but being a fan doesn't mean you have to rate everything a band, or even a band member has released, as a five star rating !To help you see more clearly, here's some example of five, four and three stars rating. If you don't see difference in these cd, see a doctor !Five stars goes to an album like ""Wish you were here""Four stars goes to an album like ""Momentary lapse of reason""Three stars goesn to the first solo album of David, just a good cd.Two stars goes to this one, be honnest and don't compare it with ""Wish you..."" for instance. Listen to ""Blue light"", ""Cruise"" or ""All lovers are derandged"" and see that About face is not a great cd, few good cuts and nothing more."
2,Pink Floyd Lite,"Gilmour's second solo album is about as much of a snore as the later albums he would record with Pink Floyd sans Roger Waters, proving once and for all that Waters was the driving force behind the band. Gilmour is an excellent guitarist and a decent singer, but his solo songwriting is fairly pedestrian. Without Waters' vision, however warped it may have been, he's just another aging veteran rocker without a whole lot to say. The same blandness that would permeate Floyd albums starting with ""Momentary Lapse of Reason"" reigns here. Ardent fans may love it, but casual fans should forget about it."
2,Just don't feel it,Most of Floyd to me is timeless. Gilmour's solo stuff sounds dated in my opinion. That's certainly not a bad thing in and of itself but this record just seems a bit too 80's poppish to me. The song Love On The Air is just ridiculous. Of course I've never cared for Townsends style of writing and think he's written several songs that just can't be taken serious. I find no songs on this record worth even putting on a compilatation. Off to the used cd store with this one.
1,Horrid!,"I can't believe that some people like this album. It STINKS! The lyrics are some of the most desperate, cliched, pathetic attempts at poetry you will ever hear. ""Blue Light"" is the WORST Pink Floyd related song I have ever heard - Gilmour is a great guitarist, an average writer of music; but even the Vengaboys can write better words!! Come on - this is awful. Sorry Dave."
2,buyer beware: original release worth it/ re-master not,"This was supposed to be a re-mastered version of this cd, but to be honest after listening to it I couldn't tell the difference from the original release. I love this album despite some of the negativity I've read from Floyd fans, but this purchase was a disappointment for me. I recommend this cd for novice Floyd fans, but if you already have the original 1984 release, don't waste your money trying to upgrade to the re-master."
4,Not to shabby,This cd is pretty good overall but it is a little too 80's sounding for me to rate it really high. I love his s/t release from 78' and I love Division Bell much better than this release or Momentary. It is a little boring at times I guess but it gets plenty of air time in my cdrom drive. I also would like to highly recommend Roger Waters solo cd amused to death and Radio Kaos. What Dave is incapable of Roger has on his discs and Vica Versa. Have a nice evening everyone!
4,A must have....,"A must have, not DG's best album, but something ost worth listening to....Produced after PF-TFC, and it's just before AMLOR, so it's in between both of the breaking points in the mid 80's PF.If you like DG, you will enjoy it a lot."
3,It's ok.,"While this solo album of David Gilmour is a far cry from Pink Floyd's works and in some ways not as good, David makes this album with his voice and guitar-playing. It's good to hear David, the songs are ""different"", I must say, but listenable. I guess my feelings about this album are mixed, I think 3 stars is adequate for it. If you are a die-hard DG fan, you'll definately want this, this is not so much for the casual fan."
2,Far from Gilmour's Best,"Workmanlike and seldom-inspired, this album finds David Gilmour unsuccessfully attempting to capture the mid-1980s mainstream rock bandwagon. Some artists could pull this off, like Robert Palmer and ZZ Top. Gilmour can't, and as a result his voice sounds harsh and his solos seem frentic and unfocused throughout. The mix is buried in that heavy reverb that so much of 80s pop over-used, and except for ""Love on the Air,"" there's almost nothing that holds up to repeated listening.I strongly suggest passing this over in favor of ""David Gilmour,"" which is Gilmour's first and best solo album. Listening to that nearly perfect album again after listening to this only reinforces what a superior collection of songs the earlier album was. Unless you have a strong fondness for 80s corporate rock done by-the-books, I can't imagine anyone listening to this often."
3,about face,i am a huge daid gilmour fan .about face is a big change from the pink floyd style that david is best known fordavid once said in a interview that song writing comes hard to him .how ever after saying that i feel david nailed it with the song murder.this song sells the cd i feel. the rest of the cd it a nice listen .
3,Lovely....,"The songs on this album comprise a pleasant collection of alternative country ballads with a more than slight injection southern influenced soul. The soft voice that guides over these songs is quite a beautiful one. It can capture the wind in a small town like Cat Power and it can be just as bone chilling (although not as powerful) as Neko Case at her best. The traditionalist element the Watson Twins brings is a nice touch and they do bring a few of these songs over the top. This album is not wholly spectacular but ""Rise Up With Fists!"", the beautiful ""Melt Your Heart"" and the heart stopping ""Born Secular"" are more than enough reason to warrant acquiring the album. By the end of the year (2006) this album's best moments will probably make it rise to being one the finest releases of the year."
4,Great vocals and songwriting.,"My favorite song on this album is ""Your are what you love."" If you like Rilo Kiley (Jenny Lewis is the lead singer) you will most likely be a fan of her solo stuff too."
4,"I love Jenny and ""the twins"".","Like many, I was initially drawn to this album for the ""Handle With Care"" cover. Now it's the only song I skip.My attraction to this album was slow coming, but now it's an all-time favorite. Regardless of genre, it's just good music. ""Rise Up With Fists"" is no doubt a strong track, and the video is wonderful. A Hee-Haw homage. The opener here is really good too, and the song ""Happy"" makes me....you know.Just when you think the music can't sound any better, you see the pics of Jenny in the booklet, and suddenly it is that much better. An explosion of talent and sex appeal."
4,Loved it!,"Harmonies were wonderful, loved the bluegrass feel. Love Jenny's striking, pure voice. ""Rise Up With Fists"" is an amazing song. I love the message."
4,Happy.,"Jenny Lewis (with the Watson Twins) was just what I was in the mood for, even if I didn't know it; in fact, I'd never heard of her or Rilo Kiley until I stumbled upon her debut solo release at a listening station. Rabbit Fur Coat is very mellow, without being boring, and conjures up images of lonely, kitchy hotel lounges in the middle of the dessert and the types of acts that might play there. While I was hardpressed to recognize any Dusty Springfield soul in her vocals, I didn't have to listen hard to hear the echoes of Toni Childs, Nanci Griffith and Tanita Tikaram, mixed with the tongue-in-cheek cynicism of Holly Cole and Meghan Mullaly."
5,Wilbury's would have been proud!,"I was excited and a little worried about the Traveling Wilburys' cover. My favorite boys of all time, (George Harrison, Bobby Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison) are a difficult act to do justice...But I was greatly suprised, these three did an amazing job on ""Handle with Care"" I was never a fan of Conor Oberst's voice...but I actually think it works well in this song--Jenny, Ben, and Conor really captured and recreated the contrast of voices that was the Wilburys' signature. The music and instruments were done just right, and I really think it honored their legacy well.(I'm still not sure about their insert of an explicitive though..) but the cover is predominately flawless.I am also a huge fan of the ""God"" theme on this album...I've been really into theology lately..."
4,It's Been in My CD Player for Months,"It's a really, really good album. The slow songs all have a quiet beauty to them that make them endlessly listenable, the not-so-slow songs are a lot of fun--in fact, how great is it that she has a Traveling Wilburys cover on here?--and the lyrics are witty and interesting throughout. You can tell that the people making this record both care about what they're doing and are having a great time doing it, too. Definitely on my list of the 10 best for the year."
1,Strickly For Lonely Music Critics,Why does this gal get good reviews? This music is poorly written and executed; to invoke the name of Laura Nyro or Dusty Springfield is to disrespect the dead! I guess all the lonely critics got a phone interview with her and that was probably their closest contact with a female in who knows how long. Buy Nicka Costa or Ashley Cleveland instead!!!
1,Blech...,I really don't like the whole thing this girl has going on. Her creativity pretty much sucks and is just random. And not to mention she looks awful on the cover of the album. The music ain't good either. Rilo Kiley isn't good either. Ben Gibbard sucks too.
5,deserves 10 stars,"Just discovered Jenny Lewis after hearing her on NPRPlease, Please do another album soonBest voice and songwriting EVER-"
5,Jenny Lewis Deserves A Grammy and then Some!!!,"I've been a Rilo Kiley fan, but Jenny has taken departure!! Her brutally honest, sarcastic, cheeky, campy lyrics are so refreshing!! I cannot stop listening to this album!! Every emotion is represented here....while listening I cry and laugh at the same time. I first saw Jenny on tour with Coldplay, she of course was fronting Rilo Kiley.....I was there, mostly, to see Rilo. We are blessed to have an artist like Jenny. Listen over and over..she gives us truth, honesty. The albums' over-all feel screams of whiskey-hank williams-tammy wynette.....and she does it so well. Thank You Jenny!!!!!"
4,She's almost too folky for me,"I like the album, but sometimes it gets a little too close to country for my taste. I'm trying to accept more southern sounding music, since I've never been a fan, so it's a good step in that direction."
4,"Worthy of purchase, yet don't hold your breath on a smooth, thorough listen","I absolutely love this cd. I listen to it practically everyday.However, I do find myself consistently skipping certain tracks.Namely, Big Guns, Charging Sky. . . AND, sadly enough, especially, Rabbit Fur Coat.My personal favorites are, Happy, Melt Your Heart, Born Secular, and God help me, Rise Up With Fists!!! I could listen to that song until I turned purple. Ugh. Brilliant.I gotta say, I don't find [most of] the lyrics to be mediocure. I mean, sure they could have been better, but name one thing that couldn't stand to improve a little."
3,Yeah... but...,"I own this album and have listened to it enough to know the lyrics. I'm a lyric person. If your like me and think that if someone is going to write lyrics, they ought to say something poetic, or interesting in an artful way, you might be a little disappointed, like I was.The lyrics on this album come across as a good effort, but somewhat of an awkward one. The music is lovely, but I get distracted by the lyrics that at times seem contrived. Jenny Lewis could be a great song writer if she stopped trying to sound like loretta lynn or whoever else and started writing lyrics without worrying about apeing folk or country or tossing in unecessary references to political songs she dosn't write, or floating pseudo-pscyoanalytical tangents. And I think she will eventually."
3,Could have been better,"Jenny Lewis is pretty, plays guitar, and she can sing very well and I think that's why she gets alot of attention. I mean there are other artists out there going solo too but you have to give her credit because she's been in the game for awhile now with Rilo Kiley.After hearing Rilo Kiley's last album I was very impressed and thought ""...hey, if it's Jenny Lewis it's gonna be good, right?"" At times it can be good when I'm in that particular mood for this kind of music but overall I would much rather prefer More Adventurous over this. The thing with this album is that I just can't listen to it when I'm not in the mood like I can with (for example) Nada Surf.And I agree with the reviewer who said something about the albums vocals are slower and softer. This album could have been better, but it's just okay..."
2,let down by the banality of the lyrics,"I had not heard of Jenny Lewis until I encountered a review of this album on Amazon.com. It sounded interesting and, musically anyway, it has a freshness that made me want to like it. However, the tunes are not so good, nor the singing so fine, that either can transcend the lack of lyrical flair. In short, not one song on this album had words that were worth listening too. They scan badly too, making for some awkward phrasing. Not one of these songs will last."
2,"Learn the art of lyric writing, then proceed.","As with her work in Rilo Kiley, Jenny Lewis' voice is quite appealing, but her lyrics are atrocious. Once she learns the art of subtlety, then her music might actually be worth listening to."
2,incomplete,"Seeing as how I purchased this primarily for the cliffs of dover tab, I was disappointed to find out that half the song isn't there! there's about a minute of the song before and after the solo which are not in the book. I suppose they assume we can figure out the missing pieces, since they are probably variations on the first verse and chorus, but if I could figure this stuff out on my own I wouldn't have needed the book in the first place! Very disappointed."
2,subtitles please,"It's pretty hard to understand the narrator, and of course, no subtitles. The video is pretty boring. While the information is good, you will lose interest quick. Doesn't cover the new Marine Corps."
1,have trouble sleeping? Play this for 10 mins and you will soon be in the land of nod,this product is an absolute waste of time and money. The music just sends me off to sleep. The method is to play some classical music whilst throwing out hundreds of random chinese nouns and verbs. If you were locked up in a cell for 10 years and had this in your ear every day for that time you would eventually be able to speak pigeon chinese with absolutely no sentence structure at all. Do not fall for this con like I did (although I get the last laugh because I am sleeping so soundly now - zzzzzz)
4,STOAA hardback,"This is the 19th Edition (facsimile of the original) published by The Philosophical Society of Los Angeles in 1973. The pages are glossy and, unfortunately, all plates are in black & white. It's a large size volume with a black hardback cover and gold lettering. M.P. Hall was a scholar of the esoteric and The Secret Teachings of All Ages is a classic in the sphere of studies that deal with the occult Mysteries. He covers Pythagoras, Isis, Hermes Trismegistus, Mithraic and early gnostic cults, Atlantis, ceremonial magic, secret societies, Quabbalah, Tarot, etc., etc. I'd recommend this edition as a very collectible one, though more recent reprints of the book have colourized plates."
1,Editorial is terrible,"I was looking forward to having a nice hardcopy of the Secret Teachings, as I had read some electronic versions in the past. The book has a nicely styled cover and exterior artwork - and that is all I can say good about the book. Typeset is very, very small - which is a trade off in print production, but isn't very easy to read. Also there are so many text problems that it really does seem to be unreadable. I am not sure if an OCR was done on a previous text or what the problem was but there are misspellings, word replacements, etc. that make this book a waste of time and money for me.You are probably better off finding an electronic copy and reading that."
4,Encyclopedic review of Esoteric systems,"This is an excellent text for anyone interested in Esoteric teachings from ancient times onward. The author covers just about anything you've heard of and probably a lot that you haven't. The color plates and illustrations are excellent and there is an amazing amount of information packed into this book. One problem arises, however: some of the information is outdated when newer discoveries are taken into account. The author wrote the book something like 80 years ago and though it's been through revisions, it still contains information that probably should be updated. That is a rare instance however, and I'd say 99% of this book is accurate, right on the money, and DEFINITELY worth the price. You probably won't find another source that covers as much as well. Buy it, borrow it, whatever, it is worth the time to read."
1,CreateSpace edittion is terrible!,"I bought the paperback CreateSpace edition and it is NOT the same book that was full of wonderful illustrations.What it is full of are typos! It reads like someone scanned a copy of the older book and then used bad text recognition software to throw this together. No wonder it's so much cheaper. BEWARE of this version!!If I could give it zero stars, I would. :("
4,exhaustive compilation of data,"The book certainly has an exhaustive amount of data. However, I'll probably get the most out of it when I can have someone read it to me. The print is just too small for easy reading and makes what should be an enjoyable experience into a labor. I do not understand why the publishers present the text in such a hard format to read."
5,Outstanding,"This is an OUTSTANDING book that is well documented, has great information and beautiful color presentations. This is a wonderful book for research purposes. The time and talent invested is awesome."
1,WRONG SIZE BOOK!!! DON'T ORDER!!!,"I ordered this book, hoping for the correct listed size (19.5 x 12.8 x 2.0 inches). What I got was the SMALLER, nearly one third the price, version! When I sent it back for a replacement, stating that is was the incorrect size, they sent me the EXACT SAME book, in return. I did't very much enjoy having to send this incorrectly sized book back to them, not once, but TWICE! I would suggest that anyone wishing to purchase this great book, do so with caution. If you do, measure it to be sure it is the correct size. Oterwise, you can order the LESS expensive, smaller verion, and get the same exact same book while saving money. Good luck, and I hope this review helps you."
2,Mostly rhetoric written before Hall was initiated.,"Manly P Hall's work is often cited by anti-masons given the argument that it's a form of esoteric witchcraft of mysticism. Coupled with the secrecy of the fraternity, many accept Hall's work as fact given that he was at one point a mason himself.It's important to note, before reading anything into this book, that Hall was NOT a freemason at the time of writing this. As a result; most of Hall's work in this novel must have been assumption. Hall wrote this book in 1928, but he was not initiated into the fraternity until 1954.It is an interesting read, but you should accept much of it as simple mystic fiction."
1,User Unfriendly,"This is a huge, heavy, incredibly detailed, impressive looking book. The print is tiny, as tiny as it gets. And the illustrations and footnotes, which are extensive and constant, are even smaller print. I have 20/20 eyesight but still could not read this book without uncomfortable effort. So how about the value of the content? Couldn't tell you. Wanna buy mine,.... cheap?"
5,one of the most complete sources available,"while this book will offer you an amazing wealth of knowledge about a vast quantity of subjects, i do not recomend it for the beginner as it is a bit difficult to read. if you have a bit of knowledge about the subjects you may be able to get through it, but you may also become frustrated. it has beautiful pictures inside that almost make it worth the price alone. i was very pleased to see the newer copies that were softcover; before then this book may not have been affordable to all who sought after it's information. i bought it mainly for it's information on masons, a belief system that has always creeped me out a little:) it still creeps me out but i'm educated as to why now:)"
4,DIFFERENT VERSIONS HAVE VARYING CONTENTS,"This note is for readers who might be thinking of purchasing this book and wonder which version they should buy. At the time of this writing, the best easily available complete version of of the original work is the hardcover volume published by Philosophical Research Society in 2008. This volume has 54 color plates and over 200 black and white illustrations. Unfortunately, this book is quite large and heavy and also expensive so this is the version that will hopefully be produced as an ebook some day. The current paperback version published by Tarcher in 2003 has only 16 color plates and approximately 100 illustrations but the text is not abridged, and I assume that this is also true for the Tarcher Kindle version that is now available. Some other printed or ebook versions may have no color plates or illustrations at all, so be careful and try to be sure of the book's contents before you buy."
3,"Outstanding piece of work, but an encyclopedia none the less","This is a collossal work, and provides a wealth of information on the different esoteric teachings and mystery schools from the past.However, don't expect to find anything on contemporary esoteric orders.I found the work to be a bit too speculative at times, not giving enough facts. Moreover, the book has a very distinct 'We, the freemasons' kind of feeling, which in my opinion hampers the objectivity of the work.Except for the big plates at the beginning of each chapter, the numerous diagrams presented here are usually printed too small to meditate upon, which is the only serious flaw.In short, as the title says, it is an encyclopedia, but nothing more. For in depth information concerning esoteric teachings, look elsewhere."
5,excellent compendium for occult philosophy,"this book of mystery and occult history has the most impressive collection of information i have ever seen. I bought a hard-cover copy in leather at an old book store in New York. Many hard critics say that it is only an encyclopedia of facts. But I would disagree because it neatly compiles information. The diagrams, which are on the small side, can be at least form part of one's jumping board toward getting at the legitimate signs and diagrams of occultism itself. I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in the mysteries of knowledge and also to those are interested in bridging the gaps that the West has failed to bring together."
4,"pleasant, not great","I was torn between giving this album 3 stars or 4, but decided to be magnanimous. I'm a big fan of King Crimson (all of their stuff, in all their different incarnations), Gentle Giant (almost all of their output), and Genesis (their early stuff). I can hear their influences on SB. This album also has some gorgeous soundscapes, but it all seems to be a bit on the light side compared to my favorite works by the aforementioned groups. Not that light is bad, I do enjoy this album, but I was hoping for something a bit more ambitious. I will keep my eyes peeled for reviews of future albums by this group, as they display competent musicianship (at the very least), and I wouldn't be surprised to find them exploring more challenging material in the future. That is my hope for them."
4,A real good cd,"I wouldn't describe this as a masterpiece (Moving Pictures/Rush, Images and Words/Dream Theater, The Yes Album/Yes) but it is highly listenable cd. Kinda of in the Yes mode but not a clone. Best track is Walking on the Wind. Like most progressive rock it grows on you."
2,Beware of Overhyped Recording,"Competent, but for the most part dull, progressive rock performed with machinelike precision, amatuerish singing, and goofy lyrics (eg, 'some people are like gravy spilled on God's Sunday shirt' - it doesn't get any goofier than that). There is too little melody and too many herky-jerky starts and stops for my taste. This group sounds like they are trying to imitate Emerson, Lake and Palmer and Yes, but wind up sounding like a cross between Porcupine Tree and Echolyn (two of the duller progressive groups around)."
2,Skilled musicians lack personality as a unit.,"I wanted to like Spock's Beard -- confess; who doesn't get a little tired of spinning their old Yes and Genesis CDs over and over again -- but if this CD is a reasonable presentation of SB, then I must respectfully pass. The band has chops to spare, and Neil Morse's vocals are serviceable, although most of the lyrics he's singing are dull-to-embarrassing. (Yes had the best answer to prog-rock lyrics: just string together a bunch of words that sing really well.)There are some memorable ideas here and there, but they're smothered by the arrangements: the band seems intent on changing time and direction every 10-15 seconds or so, which makes their compositions sound frantic and scattered. And there is no distinctive sonic profile at all, with all of the musicians displaying skill but no individual personality.Ultimately SB sounds like a somewhat unusual LA session band, a more pretentious version of Toto. Not was I was after."
2,disappointing,"This is my second spock's Beard cd after The Light. The Light amazed me. Thinking I'd found a great progressive rock band I picked up Beware of Darkness which is a fan favorite. I was so disappointed. The songs are strung together with disparate ideas that make no sense and it makes the music impossible to get into. I enjoyed some of the stuff here (The Doorway and Thoughts, specifically) but the rest failed to impress me. I guess I'll just stick with The Light."
2,Blasphemy!,"If this is the ""best"" the resurgence of Prog Rock has to offer, I haven't been missing much. Saying that ""Beware of Darkness"" is comparable to the fierce, virtuoistic, ecstatic barrage of ""Relayer"" is blasphemy. If you are reading these reviews looking for what's hot in prog rock, I suggest a journey back in time - there's a wealth of music by Happy the Man, Be Bop Deluxe, Yes, Gentle Giant, King Crimson, Early U.K. or Genesis, Banco, P.F.M., ELP, Marillion, Renaissance, Van Der Graff Generator and many more that's far superior to Spock's Beard. This cd reminds me a lot of ""Eat Me In St. Louis"" by It Bites."
5,Loved it,"It seems to me that there are two opposing camps of reviewers of Spocks Beard CDs. One are the fans of the band ( and I count myself as one ) and the others are all the aging Yes and ELP fans who to a man say stuff like ""Er...it's pop music"" and ""they are not Yes/Genesis/ELP"" and ""this is not Progressive Rock"".I beg to differ.This is 21st Century Progressive and it is very very good. The title track of the CD is excellent. What damns Progressive music usually is great musicianship and no tunes. That is not the case with ""the Beard"" who know how to make long songs with excellent tuneful hooks.Recommended."
3,Too Pretentious,"Maybe it's because I'm not a lyric guy, but this album bored me in large part. While I found some of the album musically interesting, I thought the singing sounded self-important and lacking in edge. I blame that on the main influence of this band in the early days by Neal Morse. Once he left the band, they have continued to get better and better."
4,Very Funny,A little bawdy but sweetly so. Waitin' For The Guy To Die is a scream as is Why Can't They Send 'em All. Well worth the price to have the live performances including intros to each song.
3,Redundancy,"Not a bad book, but not as great as I hoped. There were way too many jokes about Bill Gates dying (although it would be nice) and comparing Gates to god. Worth it for the nerds who have a sense of humor (mac users!). Also has a really nice index which makes it easy to find your favorite jokes by the name of the persons in the joke."
5,This is a good book.,The top ten lists are refreshingly original. The glossary of Windows terms skewers the over zealous promotional engine that is the bane of the Sunday paper color supplement. The Microsoft New Product Hype Decoder is my personal favorite and was worth the price of the book.
5,A Hoot!,"I had to put the book down I was laughing so hard. I especially liked the haiku's and Window's glossary. The ""Top Ten"" lists alone were definitely worth it."
5,LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!,"I love this movie and so does my daughter and my parents. When it came out in the theaters and I saw it the first time I fell in love with it and went to it several more times taking everyone I knew who would go, and they all loves it! It is funny, well written, and well performed. I think the actors all did an excellent job in it and Vin shows he is just as good at making a family/kids movie as he is at making the tough guy films."
4,I Love Vin,"He rocks as Riddick, but it is refreshing to see him in a family comedy from Disney. He's not a sellout!!!!!!!!!!! He did a good job. I loved it! Sorry that I cannot comment further, but he's done a real good job for what he's done so far. Keep up the good job, Vin!!! Eye Candy is in!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pretty Good Family Movie,"This is a pretty good movie for family viewing. We enjoyed it. We liked the duck and diaper humor. There was nothing inappropriate in it. It reminded me a little of That Darn Cat, which I remember fondly from when I was a kid. The puzzle at the end was clever. They didn't develop the relationship very well between the principle and the new ""nanny"" but it didn't particularly matter because that's not what this movie was about. I did like the teenage girl character and her struggle with grief and responsibilities. That character was well developed and appealing to my own younger girls as a role model."
4,FUN FAMILY FLICK,"Looking for a fun film for the family, not complicated but easy-going, with a a happy ending? Get the popcorn ready and just sit back and enjoy. The kids will be laughing out loud. You not find the classic movie of all time, but you will find Vin Diesel doing a good job in his protection assignment and adjusting to a raucous family, with plenty of chuckles along the way with obnoxious teens and needy little sibs. Carol Kane and Brad garrett are great as always, and the weird, crazy Korean neighbors (spies, assassins) are hilarious. Some of the other reviewers seemed to be writing to complete a criticism term paper, and forgot that this little flick was for entertainment, and that's one of the biggest reasons we go to the movies. I liked it."
4,Great Family Movie,"Good plot and not over acted. Well done and believable for all ages. Enjoy with all your emotions activated, will not be disappointed as there is something for everyone!The Pacifier (Full Screen Edition)"
5,The Pacifier,"I purchased this movie for my 7-year-old nephew and 13-year-old niece. It was on my niece's Amazon wish list. We watched the movie together and enjoyed it thoroughly. I would recommend it for good, clean entertainment."
5,The Pacifier,"Enough has been said about the movie, I'll say it's well worth your time. All the kids in our house loved it, it kept them focused and entertained. I liked it too!"
3,A cute movie,"The Pacifier is a really cute movie. Nothing special, and no Disney classic, but it entertains. It has its funny parts, but all in all it's enjoyable."
1,Noooooo!!,"Who ever greenlit this sorry excuse for a movie needs pacifying now! While Kindergarden Cop had some wit and originality this scrapes the dried up crusted gunk from the bottom of the barrel.Do yourself a favour and watch, well anything else instead."
1,For the very young,Any adult not watching this with a child should not make it to the end. Insultingly bad.
1,Warning: Unbearable Waste Of Time,On a recent domestic flight this was the only entertainment available. If you are able to read this review then your IQ is far too high to like this DVD. After fifteen minutes I knew I was in deep trouble. I paid $5 for the headphones and I had little else to do so I stayed with it. Sixty minutes in I couldn't take it anymore. Off came the headphones and out came the in flight magazine. Advice: plop the kids down and walk away.
5,Great Movie,Great to see Vin in a very different role. It's a bit cheesy but it's a great family watch.
2,Weak Movie,"My wife and I went to a sneak preview last night. It was great fun, Radio Disney was there having contests and giving away prizes. Unfortunately the movie was pretty weak. The best comic moments were in the trailer. Diesel didn't look entirely comfortable, I'm not sure if it was the comedy or the kids. The plot was one dimensional, and the family values moments were very shallow.In the end it was a transparent attempt at a Spy Kids like movie. I'm sure the kids will love it... once."
3,An enjoyable mindless comedy,"I love Vin Diesel, I am willing to pay $10 to see him in any movie, especially a comedy. Even though this was a Disney movie, it was worth the almost 2 hours in the movie theater. The plot was pretty predictable, but it was mindless fun, especially seeing Vin being a comedic actor. I thought the kids were cute, the scenes with poopy diapers and the fireflies troop are cute too. All in all I enjoyed it, and will buy it on dvd when it comes out. Thanks for the laughs, Vin!!!"
1,What were they thinking?,This was an awful movie. There was nothing funny about it. The plot was over done. We have seen this kind of movie a thousand times and on top of that it wasn't even funny. It did not have the right characters to make it funny and the plot was not strong enough to carry the movie alone. I couldn't even get through the movie because it did not promise what it was supposed too. Don't say you are a comedy and then not be. Would not buy again not even if it was a $1.00
5,Family Friendly Film,A hilariously funny action disney comedy that is fun for the whole family and Vin Diesel makes it a bonus.
5,Vin Diesel is the most EPIC actor of my generation,"Pound for Pound, Vin Diesel is the best actor in Hollywood. With such critical acclaim from Fast and Furious, Chronicles of Riddick 1,2, &3...11, Saving Private Ryan (Caparzo, the guy who gets taken out by a sniper. He is without question very EPIC and if you didnt pick up the sarcasm, you probably wont enjoy his finer works in A Man Apart, XXX, and Boiler Room. But if you enjoy Lady in the Water, you'll enjoy Vin's entire catalogue."
4,"A good, predictable Disney movie","This movie was all that I expected it to be. It's a fairly wholesome, entirely predictable Disney movie. If you haven't noticed, most Disney movies are notoriously predictable, but that's okay! Sometimes its nice to rent a movie and know that in the end, enemies will become friends and the bad guys get what they deserve. I thought Vin Diesel was really good in this movie. It was the first movie of his I ever watched and I was impressed. I imagine it takes a lot of guts to go from hardcore action flicks to a Disney movie and I, for one, respect him for that. The supporting cast was also very good. I would definately recommend this one to anybody!"
3,Not a great movie... but not bad either,"Hmmm, what to say about this movie. It is billed as a comedy, but honestly I didn't find myself laughing all that much during this movie. don't get me wrong, it wasn't a terrible movie - but it seems like all the truly funny parts were used in the comercials and therefore we knew what to expect.Some of the movie was down right lame. The scenes where Vin is fighting the 'ninja's' are just terrible, but if you suffer through them the story itself isn't too bad.I enjoyed the movie for the most part. I think the key to this movie is going into it not expecting to be laughing the whole time. Go into it with the idea that you will spend about 2 hrs watching a decent movie, but not anything more than that or you will be disappointed.This is a good family movie though as some of the ideals the movie trys to portray are along that line."
3,Not as good as expected,"The Pacifier has a lot of fake action, particularly at the beginning and during fighting scenes. Besides action, other fake things include a trap door in the garage floor that no one knew about; a high US military person secretly working for North Korea. There was lots of gun scenes but no shooting.Okay, now for the good parts: Vin Diessel does some silly dancing, and really just makes a fool of himself babysitting 5 kids. He has to take them to school, to the grocery store; all while acting like he is still a S.E.A.L.Overall, it's a good movie, but certainly not the greatest."
4,"Cute. Not Terrific, Just Cute","There are 2 methods of chaging your 'movie persona': the Robert Preston ""I'm gay! So there!"" method, [vidé -S*O*B- or -Victor, Victoria-] or the Ahhnuld method [as in -Kindergarten Cop-]. The Rock uses Robert Preston hilariously in -Be Cool-. Vin Diesel ... does less OK in -The Pacifier-.Sure, he's great w/the kids - i esp. loved his way of teaching Zoe to drive & Lulu to stand up as a proud Firefly - but there's little more than that to recommend this ""Ooooh, lookit the Tough Movie Star bond w/children"". It's nice to see him being non-judgmental about the son's desire to be in a musical. But his ""Ewww! Red Baby!"" schtick is *soooo* overdone.It's a cute movie, but 1 can call each of the 'surprise twists' in 1's sleep [hey, hubby Donald slept thru the 1st .5 hour w/no ill effect!]. & 1 wishes for something a bit .... different for all the effort Dinney & Diesel put into this sleep aide...."
2,Get something else,"I really like Vin Diesel, but I just could not stand this movie. I am not really sure who the intended audience is. I don't think it is Vin Diesel fans because there just isn't enough action or tough guy comedy. It isn't much of a kids movie because so much of it is not focused on the kids in the movie. On top of all that, I thought it was trite and boring. It wasn't the worst I have seen, but spend your money elsewhere!"
2,HA - HA COMEDY,"VIN DIEANSAL IS A REALLY GOOD ACTOR; BUT IN THIS ONE IT'S REALLY WEAK.IT'S ACTULLY VERY FUNNY WHEN YOU SEE THE PREVIEWS THE FIRST TIME EVER.THE PACIFAIR ISN'T THE BEST COMEDY EVER.I'M JUST GOING TO WACTH IT IN SATURDAY AND RIGHT ANOTHER REVIEW LATER(SIRLSEY,I CAN'T BELIVE POEPLE ARE REVIWING WHEN IT'S NOT EVENT OUT;NOT COUNTING AS ME.)"
1,"Not really very creative,,,,the same old stuff!","What has happened to the Disney movies? Where is the creative talents that Disney was known for? I'm an ex-Disney employee and spent 8 wonderful years working in live entertainment. What i found was after EPCOT opened, Eisner got to big for himself and many talented people left. Now, i worked in Orlando but would chat with many on the other coast about the movies that were being up out by Disney. Many of the old timers retired and the replacements seem to come from other failing studios. Because they didn't know about Disney tradition (Walt's traditions)the new movies of Disney looks just like anyone elses which is basically boring. I believe the big hay-day of the Disney Organization is over. You can no longer tell the difference between Six Flags, Universal Studios and now Disney. They are all the same. The glory days of Disney because of a lack of immagination is over, especailly for their movies."
2,the Pacificer,"maybe the movie is good/great /bad don""t know never got to see it . It kept freezing up on me several times on instant video."
5,DVD got here when they said it would and arrived in good condition. Would recommend seller!!,"Great family movie!! Has comedy, some drama and shows how relationships can change. Highly recommend this movie for a family night."
5,I loved this movie..,"I felt like the plot flowed quite nicely and the kids were good actors. Although I saw it more for the eye candy than anything else (Vin Diesel). So if you are a mother having to sit through this, don't get up when Vin crawls through the sewer, you'll miss the towel scene. All in all I'd probably go see it again. You won't regret taking your kids to this either."
4,4.5 stars. MUCH better than I thought it would be.,"I watched this on Dish Network's PPV, having nothing better to do. I thought it would be an average, mediocre movie. I was pretty surprised.Lt. Shane Wolfe is a no-holds-barred Navy SEAL who is on his toughest mission yet: Protect the 5 Plummer kids and their late father's secret experiment called G.H.O.S.T. Of course, Wolfe doesn't know about parenting, resulting in some hilarious jokes.This moive is not only for teenage girls who go ""OMG!!! vin deisel is sooooooooooo hott!!!!!!1111"", but for the whole family as well. This is a great popcorn movie with a sense of humor. The part where the little girl is making fun of Diesal's man-boobs was hilarious. Don't listen to the critics, take your family and rent this movie."
2,Disappointing,"The movie is okay for younger children and while there were some funny scenes in the movie & laughter from children in the movie, it didn't hold my interest at all. I'm a fan of Disney but really wished they'd go back to annimated movies."
1,"Hello Rock Bottom, I'm Vin Diesel","Has he ever made a good movie? I'm just curious, I'm not being negative about him. Has he really ever made one. I've seen 4 of his movies now, each one of them worse than the next. But heh, I guess this isn't the Chronicles of Riddick."
3,Ok,This movie was just ok.It was funny in parts but not reallyfunny.This movie is about A navy seal who watches some kids while there mother is away doing something important the first kid is named lu lu and she is the middle child whom wants to be shanes friend the next kid is......well I cant remember her namebut she's the oldest(I think)And she thinks shane is A completeembaressment the other kid is named seth he's kind of gothicand likes to act(secretly) Like I said its just ok.If you likethis movieI reccomend robots.
1,WHY GOD WHY????!!,"I only went and saw this movie because I was curious how well Vin Diesal could pull off a family comedy after all the action movies he's done. He needs to stick with the action movies. This movie was horribly cliched, after the first 10 minutes I knew pretty much how the rest of the movie would lay out. It was poorly scripted and the acting felt like it was forced out. The whole ""Hollywood tough guy trying to be family friendly"" has been played out. It was okay with Arnold, when Hulk Hogan tried to repeat it, it wasn't as good, with Vin it just isn't worth the try. Please save your money and time and go see something else."
1,Bad timing between the U.S. and the U.K....,"Beginning this year, I made a promise to myself that I would refrain from watching anything cut from U.K. versions of film but left in U.S. versions of films for five years (like a long new year's resolution). Well, as of 2nd quarter 2005, my promise was broken! Both when I saw this at the drive-in (in which a couple days afterwards, the BBFC finally posted that movie on the database as pre-cut), and when the DVD came out here in the States (only to mend for a family problem, AND the BBFC posting a DVD entry in the database saying THIS WAS CUT!). It's just I think the way movies are handled across the pond are better than here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But the movie's still great. I'm only giving this one star becuase of Disney's poor timing from the U.S. release of their movies, to the U.K. release of their movies."
3,A pleasant no brainer,"A family type movie -- who'd a thunk it.Not a seat grabber but a decent way to spend a couple of hours with the kids and not be embarrassed by explicent sexual situations (shades of TEAM AMERICA!) or language. Of course, the best part for me was Diesel walking around in a towel. I only mention this because I found I wasn't breathing properly the whole time and nearly fell over. Face it, the boy is very, very delicious.Don't expect a whole lot, just grab the kiddies and some popcorn and enjoy the show. Watch your breathing though..."
2,What was that about??!,"Okay, let's get one thing straight, the acting was pretty good. All the kids were cute and adorable and do a pretty darn good job on their parts. Vin Diesel is good and lovely to watch, and Lauren Graham is in the movie! (Think: Lorelai Gilmore). Though, Lauren looked different for some reason, I couldn't quite place it; added pounds? new hair style? I don't know... anyway onto the storyline, or lack there of.To put it simply, it appears the object was to write a movie with Vin Diesel in it, in the style of Kindergarten Cop. However, someone failed to hire a good writer, or director! They rushed through the intro and cut through the blah-blah's (substance) of the story just so they could arrive at the part where they could ""showcase"" Vin Diesel in this role of a tough guy caring for some adorable kids. It's not convincing; so many scenes just happen they leave you feeling like you had whiplash.All in all, it's probably a great movie for kids about 8, 9, 10 years old."
3,Vin Diesel as a babysitter???,"Never could have imagined Vin Diesel as a baby-sitter, but The Pacifier proved Vin could do anything, or almost anything. The movie is pretty funny, especially when Vin tries to act as a ""dad"". The plot of the movie is not that predictable, only in some scenes. Good movie to watch with the family."
4,The Pacifier,Vin Diesel was great in comic relief. The change from his tough guy countenance was refreshing and well done.
2,It's not the best movie I've seen.........,"Hello. My name is Shelby and I'm 10 years old. When I watched the Pacifier, I really thought the acting stunk in most parts. Some of the comedy was a bit corny too. It got kind of confusing, going back and forth from subject to subject. And come on, NINJAS breaking into their house and tying everyone up because they want a stupid little computer program? Give me a break! I've seen WAAY better movies than this. It was funny and it's a pretty good family movie, and that's what counts. But otherwise, it wasn't too decent."
3,Good family flick,"I thought I would shut this movie off, before it ended. Thefirst half hour was slow, but then it picked up. The rest ofthe movie was actually pretty good. There are some funny, andmushy parts in this movie you'll like. It's a good movie towatch, with your kids."
5,"smooth and silky, clearly understood, emotionally provoking","I last heard this album in 1974 and have been looking for a copy for the past 5 years. I was very very suprised to find it through Amazon. To me this is pure lyrical music at its best, no rap, no profanity, just silky smooth crooning reminesent of the 70's."
2,Battery's life reduced by 60% in 7 months!,"Initially the battery gave amazing backup of around 3-3.5Hours, but from the last 1 month, it gives a max of 1-1.5Hours of backup. Then I ran a battery check and it said that the Battery might be broken or old, the capacity is 46.7% of original!So, the battery sucks! After 7 months of usage, I am back to low battery life!"
3,It works,"So far so good, I am kind of worry because it is not an original Sony VAIO accessory but I am willing to try it, its last for almost 2 hours in stand by mode."
3,Would be ok - I believe the one I received was used.,"I ordered this for my boyfriend and it would have been fine except I'm pretty sure the one I received had been used. It was very dirty looking inside and had 'JB' written in sharpie underneath, which is not my or my boyfriends intials so I was a bit disgusted and returned it."
5,Thomas' Last is One of His Finest,"Ross Thomas' last published book is typical of his output and agood place to start reading one of America's finest, mostunderappreciated writers.All of the classic Thomas elements are here: the brilliant opening scene, the quirky character names, the sly political wit, and, of course, plenty of great fun.The plot is too complicated really to describe in just a few lines. Besides, it is more fun to read and discover it for yourself. As you can expect from Thomas, it is inventive and unique, with plenty of delicious twists and turns.When Thomas died a few years ago we lost one of the true greats in the mystery/suspense--or, truly, any--genre. His body of work matches up favorably with that of any writer. Each of his books deserves to be read and savored. He is sorely missed."
2,Love Ross Thomas BUT the publisher needs to proof-read Kindle editions,"The Kindle edition has hundreds, maybe thousands of typographical errors -- largely missing spaces between words. It's clear the book was optically scanned and published without any thought to a proof-read! Come on, guys, have a little respect for the author and the reader. I've found this to be pretty much the case with all the Kindle versions of Ross Thomas books. Very sad and disappointing."
5,YOU SHOULD SEE THIS GUY LIVE!!!,"Not to repeat others, I am trying to get PBS stations to use his video LIVE AT LEVERKUSEN for fund raising. Then Amazon will sell out their stock of CDs! I like all but the country song. HE IS THE BEST! ALONG WITH ROY BUCHANAN!"
1,Not for the faint of heart or anyone else's for that matter,"The first time I had the pleasure of watching this movie I was left speechless. I watched it with one of the filmmakers in their own living room. If there was supposed to be some part of the movie that was for the horror enthusiasts or political reformers, please let me know. I think it must have been hidden in all the unnecessary exploits of naked women. Long Pig does not even have a plot line that their own script writers could follow. All I gathered from it was a few random stories of college kids partying, and completely non-related cannabalistic deaths. Overall, I feel like I wasted 3 hours of my life on a video of Girls Gone Wild: Horror Movie Style. I believe that this movie is more for Mystery Science Theater 3000 enthusiasts rather than horror enthusiasts and if by a political statement they mean taking 3 hours to say nothing at all then sure!"
4,What More Could You Want...,How about Rev On The Red Line? It would have been a 5 star review if that song was included.
3,"""Complete""? I think not...","OK, no matter what list of songs are on a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation, there's no way to please everybody. But to call a CD ""Complete"" Greatest Hits and not include ""Starrider"" or ""Rev On The Red Line"", well that's an outright lie. So although this is a great collection with a lot of classic Foreigner tunes, I had to deduct 1 star for those two omissions, and another one for the misleading title. If you want ""Complete"", go for the Definitive Collection. But still a worthwhile purchase if you can find it at an auction site and get it for 3 or 4 bucks."
5,still going strong 30 years later,"foreigner are still going strong 30 years later. just so you know,they have new members now. with hits like feels like the first time,cold as ice,hot blooded,head gameswaiting for agirl like you,i want to know what love is,say you will,and i don't want to live without you,don't worry that this isn't the real foreigner. listen to this akbum celebrate 30 years of great music with foreigner. get to know the new lineup and listen to exended versions. i'll explain later in another review in the future. ed wilson"
2,Kind of Cheesy,"I was just a so-so fan but thought that buying the collection might make me into an avid fan. Not so. The tunes are original and kind of catchy, but frankly the production quality is low. My 10 year old said, ""What's wrong with the music?"" because it just doesn't have the quality of current recordings. So I would stay away unless you are already a really big fan."
5,Foreigner - Complete Greatest Hits,This is a terrific collection of all the best of classic Foreigner music.
5,Great Foreigner Album,"I got this CD because I had the same album on cassette and really liked it. This has four more songs on it than the cassette and even though I didn't know those four, they aren't bad. If you like Foreigner, you will like this CD."
4,Good,The item arrived in great shape within 5 days of purchase. I bought this CD preparing for a concert and the quality and shipping time was perfect.
3,FOREIGNER,"THIS IS A GOOD CD,HOWEVER A LOT OF THE SONGS WERE NEVER GREAT HITS FOR FOREIGNER,BUT IT IS WORTH BUYING"
1,Another Foreigner greatest hits CD? Give me a break.,"When will this insanity stop? I mean, don't we already have Records, The Very Best -- And Beyond, Classic Hits Live, and Jukebox Heroes: The Foreigner Anthology? If you're looking for a good greatest hits CD from Foreigner, and don't want to buy Jukebox Heroes: The Foreigner Anthology, buy The Very Best -- And Beyond."
1,I'd Rather Listen to An Accident Victim Scream!,"My mom listened to this band when I was a kid, and I liked it then. Now that I have some taste, I think I'd rather heard David Cassidy. These guys couldn't be much worse. In fact, whenever I hear ""Jukebox Hero,"" I think Lou Gramm sounds like someone is pulling out his teeth with a doorknob and some string. Actually, he sounds that way on most of their songs. ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" is totally cornball schmuckism at its worst, and ""I Wanna Know What Love is"" makes my nose bleed. These guys are lucky they were big when they were, because sickening puke like Maroon 5 has taken their place. One star for ""Do What You Like,"" the only good song they ever recorded (It's on Head Games). The rest is just sickening."
2,Boring,"This Cd I feel is too long. I can't stand Foreigner anymore, they used to be great. Awful edits like Urgent, Jukebox Hero, & Waiting for a Girl Like You have to be changed. And that boringballad, what is it?????? I Want to Know What Love Is....Irritating for 2 minutes. And that singer, he kind ofraises his voice too much. Not one of the best bands I haveever heard. Other irritating songs are HEADKNOCKER, Blue Morning,& Head games and they kinda suck. They just give me on my nerves.This is noise.....buy any album from Dire Straits insted. Dire Straits are the best....................................."
5,Great collection of Songs,"This is one of my favorite cd's I own. Foreigner was always one of my mother's favorite bands growing up. She bought this album a few years ago, and I was hooked on them ever since. I love alot of '70s bands Foreigner is at the top. This is a MUST own Album for any fans of '70s music."
2,Songs,There were only about four songs that appealed to me. The others sounded all alike. No life to the songs.
5,Solid Hits all you will need,"this is some cool Songs.Foreigner is best served here.all of there overall best songs are featured here.""Urgent"" still sounds really cool as does "" Double Vision"".they understood the concept of Arena Rock Anthems&it worked like a charm here.on a Greatest Hits set like this it works like a charm but Album to Album it wears thin.this sums Foreigner up really well."
4,GOOD MEMORIES,"ENJOY LISTENING TO THEM, BRING BACK , THOSE GOOD OLD DAYS. WHEN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR SINGING ABOUT. LOVE IT"
1,DISC BROKEN,TRIED TO GET IT REPLACED AND HAVE NOT RECIEVED IT. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT CAN REPLACE THE FORIEGNER DISC?
5,A Must For Foreigner Fans!!!!,"What can I say?? If your a fan of Foreigner then this compilation needs to be added to your collection. 20 of they're biggest hits from 1977's top 5 hit ""Feels Like The First Time"" up through 1992's ""Soul Doctor"". Nine top 10 hits, seven top 5's and they're only Number 1 ""I Want To Know What Love Is"".All the hits are there, from early rockers such as ""Cold As Ice"", ""Hot Blooded"", ""Double Vision"", ""Head Games"" and ""Urgent"" to the power ballads like ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" and ""I Want To Know What Love Is"" through the 80's rock hits like ""That Was Yesterday"", ""Say You Will"" and ""I Don't Want To Live Without You"".The sound quality is fantastic, it's crystal clear just as if it was recorded today. So buy this CD crank up the volume and enjoy one of the greatest rock groups in music history. I'd also like to say Foreigner belongs in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame!"
1,Every song has been shortened!,"I've grown up listening to Foreigner, and wanted to get a ""greatest hits"" album so I'd have them to listen to in the car and iPod. Bought this album and on the first song realized that there was a significant cut in the middle (Feels like the first time), 37 seconds cut. This always bothered me. All the other songs seemed complete. I just found a CD I didn't know I had, The Very Best And Beyond, and every song that is the same between the two discs is shortened on this album. Hot Blooded: 1m19sec! Urgent: 10 secs, Double Vision: 9 secs. Every song that's the same is from 1sec to over a minute shorter. DO NOT BUY THIS! It looks like the new No End in Sight double CD is a great choice. Very disappointed."
3,Cut short,"This would've been a pretty good album except for one small problem. Most of the tracks,the good ones especially,have been reduced to the short version. What was wrong with the original full-length versions? If you're a real Foreigner fan,buy all their albums. If you want just the hits,then the double-disc anthology is probably reccommended."
3,Truly Foreigner,"In the 1980's, many acts were chained under the tag name ""Corporate Rock"". When Foreigner entered the 80's, the group blended songs that were both easy and hard listening for all times of need.The Foreigner 2002 Complete Greatest Hits package, consists of 20 songs packed with a hard rock edge, and a dash of sweet, soulful songs that truly reflect passion. The album goes above Foreigner's first two greatest hits albums, Records and The Very Best and Beyond, but without Lou Gramm and Mick Jones solo tracks from their 2000 anthology. The songs include ballads like Waiting For A Girl Like You, That Was Yesterday, I Don't Want To Live Without You, and I Want To Know What Love Is. Other songs like Juke Box Hero, and Soul Doctor, also are branded as mega-hits from the successful rock band.While Foreigner hasn't had a massive hit album since the late 80's their songs are still as joyous and enduring as ever. It still proves that the ""Corporate Rock"" image still lives on."
4,GREAT AMERICAN ROCK AND ROLL BAND,"THIS IS GOOD DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN EDITED FROM FM RADIO. ITS DESIGN TO GO FROM ONE SONG TO THE OTHER. I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITHOUT YOU, THE FIRST 10 SECONDS OR SO ARE EDITED. FOR ME THAT IS A BUMMER. I LIKED THE ORIGINAL CUT FROM THE ALBUM. STILL ALL THE SONGS SHOWCASE A VERY TALENTED SONGWRITING TEAM. LOU GRAMM'S VOCALS ARE FANTASTIC!"
4,No defined genre...,"Probably the best thing about this CD is that it has something for everybody. On one end of the spectrum you have the more up-beat classic rock type hits like ""Cold as Ice"" and ""Double Vision"". On the other end there are the adult contemporary lighter tunes like ""I Want to Know What Love Is"" and ""I Don't Want to Live Without You"". Another thing I found as an accomplishment of the album is the change of mood from the beggining of the CD to the finish. It was very well done. You have the more harsh tracks like ""Dirty White Boy"" and ""Headknocker"" and then that precipitates into his obsession with women, beggining with the song ""Women"". On the down side, I didn't really enjoy listening to it track after track. I found it more enjoyable to just turn it on, listen to whatever song I wanted to hear, and then turn it off. And why does Foreigner have so many damn greatest hits albums?"
2,great,I really liked the cd. It brings out the feeling inside him i like the way he sings all his songs.
1,Jaded...only if you enjoy this sugar-coated pop.,"Oh how the might have fallen. MTV here we come. Hopefully they shall see the error of their ways and return to the ""rock"". In the name of the father, Angus & Malcolm, amen."
2,Is there only one song on this single?,"If so, why would anyone shell out $7.49 (plus shipping) for one measly song; one that's not even that good, I might add."
1,Why my lord?,"This song could've been accepted as one of their older songs from the 1970's. Then I would've liked it because it would be acceptable little pop song that got you calm before the big heavy song comes next.But no.Sadly, Aerosmith has fallen. The song has no solo! Ok, about one half-of-a-second, 3 note solo. Whatver happened to those long bluesy solos which showed you how mean Joe Perry was? HAH?Sadly, even the riffs, which was the important part of the band, are so stupid it makes me want to puke. I hope they come out with another album like Nine Lives was. Enjoy."
5,Excellent Quality at a Great Price,"This is a beautiful, luxurious Men's robe perfect for summertime wear. Craftsmanship is excellent as is the quality of the silk. I ordered the burgundy/maroon color and it is beautifully deep--very nice!BTW, Thank you, #1 Reviewer--you positively need to order a size smaller than usual. I bought this for my husband, and the Large is a perfect fit (he'd usually need an XL because of his height & shoulders, but I ordered a L based on the first reviewer's recommendation and it fits JUST RIGHT--Thanks again!).Another Amazon winner!"
5,Perfect Gift,"I bought this gift for my husband for our first Christmas. He absolutely loved it--the color, the texture, everything. After searching around on the internet, it was one of the best deals, as well. The gift arrived quickly and without any problems. I highly recommend."
5,great robe,"I thought that wearing a silk robe was more an affectation than anything else. Happily, I was wrong. This robe is well-made, comfortable, and it really looks nice."
4,Silk Robe,"I purchased this robe for travel. It is light weight, packs nicely and appears to be well made. The robe is cut slightly on the large side so if you are really a large, do not buy the extra large. The product was delivered on time and was a good value for the money."
5,perfect,this robe was beyond my wildest expectations. i will be purchasing another for my girlfriend . .A great gift. definitely an A+
5,Love it,"Most comfortable robe I have for mornings when I get out of bed. Like that the belt has a button to attach it so it doesn't get lost. Light enough to easily pack. As others have noted, it is cut large, so the large covers the essentials quite well; I had originally ordered the extra large for the same reason, but it swam. I note that the exchange process was simple, free and flawless. I highly recommend this robe, both for travel and home."
3,Luxurious,"Pretty robe, but mostly about looks. Not thick enough to be cozy and warm. I haven't washed it yet, so don't know about that aspect. I think my guy would have been more impressed with a long chenille or a heavy terry."
1,I Wish I Had Not Bought It At Amazon,"The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time."
4,too long to ship,"This item took forever to come in the mail, especially since they charge so much for shipping..."
3,HDMI CABLES,"The Product seems to be in good condition, but still not certain about the quality of the signal.Because my component signal seems to be better than the HDMI."
4,HDMI CABLE,The cable looks so good. it serves the purpose absolutely. the quality of the cord could be little improved to gain more sells
3,Item is working only on my apple tv,Item is working only on my apple tv. I was confused about the Item if it was GE as General Electric or not.
5,A Blueprint that we should all use!,This book shares Biblical principles that we should all live by. We can with God's help buy back the waisted opportunities in our lives. Redeeming the Time-Where Do I Begin? is a life-changing book. You need this book and you need to share it with others!
3,not what i thought it would be,"i got this book last year and had looked forward to it's arrival for what seemed like an eternity. when it got here, i was let down. it's filled with snippits of information on various things, like bands, stores and whatnot. it's not actually a book to read. it's more of a reference guide. there is some info in there that is useful, but it's not what i thought it would be."
2,"The pretenciousness of Mercer giving "" goth "" a bad name...","To keep this short and sweet, Mercer denounces the Cure and the Banshees' influence on the genre ( although both bands are MUCH,MUCH more than "" goth "" ), seems to be of the opinion that the current Valor version of Christian Death is indeed the same banddespite the fact it is now third rate metal ( and that the immortal Rozz, Gitane, David Glass, George Belenger, James McGerty and Rikk Agnew all are no longer in the equation ).At least he has the good taste to like London After Midnight,even though they, too, are far, far, more than a "" goth "" band.And Corpus Delecti, another wonderful band. But Mercer's book in pretencious; sterotyping the genre, and the lack of info on thesubculture is unforgivable; given this egomaniac's know-it-all-attitude. Much of info here is out of date as well. ---Funeral Rites 2"
1,Junk - Don't waste your money,"Tissue thin. These gauze pads are advertised as 12-ply but are only 4-ply and that's of a thin gauze with a very loose weave. Maybe if you put three or four together you've got a useful pad, but that makes them about double the cost for a quality gauze pad at the drug store.Don't waste your money."
1,terrible,item is not as described. it's too thin than normol pad you buy at cvs or other drug store. almost useless. thank god it's relatively cheap. so not loss that much.
2,You couldn't sell these houses with these pictures,"While there is no doubt that Frank Lloyd Wright's houses are spectacular, and I am a big fan, this book does them no justice at all. It is scrappily put together and contains some of the worst photography I have ever seen. A real let down. While it does not cost much, your money will be wasted if you buy this book."
4,Stylish and stylized,"Part of the Periplus series on Pacific Rim cooking, this slim volume features a choice selection of recipes ranging from homey classics like Ochazuke (rice with green tea) to elegant Red Snapper with Sea Urchin Threads. The food styling is gorgeous, though something few of us would be willing to spend the hours to accomplish at home. Carve each piece of potato into a 3D hexagon? I think not.And, despite an extensive pictorial glossary, many recipes call for ingredients that are not available in Japanese markets in the United States, and are not defined anywhere in the book. Ohba leaf, anyone, or Hime radish? The book's editors in Asia are obviously out of touch with American readers."
2,didnt have enough information,I searched and searched trying to find out exactly what was on this CD but to no avail. When you order a book or CD you get to look at a page or two to see if this is what you are looking for. I did NOT find any such thing sooooo I ordered anyway and was very disappointed with my purchase. It had nothing on it that I didnt already know. I wasted my money.
2,Concise but boring,"This book is more of a rapid pre-exam revision guide. The writing style is very monotonous, archaic and brief; no effort is made to rationally explain concepts. Instead the authors presume you know the basics, thus you will need sound fundamental knowledge of radiological physics to make out heads and tails. If you are looking for an exhaustive text look elsewhere. I give it the 2 stars only because I cleared the first FRCR examination by revising exclusively with this book. (Of course I have read other books on this subject previously). Be warned it will require a huge effort and perseverance to read this ""gothic"" book. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NEWBIES."
3,Meh.,"I expected more durability from a screwdriver with a metal striking cap on the end. The tip was solid and hard, but it didn't hold up well for demolition purposes which is most of why I purchased it."
5,Fantastique!,"For anyone who likes African music, this is the CD to buy. It is fun, it is easy to listen to, it is stimulating. I highly recommend it."
1,Hmm,"Pros: Looks pretty.Cons: Poor nTune overclocking, very poor motherboard pin setup(big cable mess) Unable to change clock speeds in Bios.Over advertised, and definitely not worth its price."
4,"Cute toy, some dont work!!!","We got the doll and it was really difficult to install and get the program to work, once I actually got it working, I found out that I have to install it over again everytime I want to use the disk.... And then I tried to install all the information into the doll and it didnt reconize the doll!!! Anyway, I called Toys 'R' us and they are affialiated with amazon and they will take her as a return and are givng me a new one. So if you do have a problem, just take it back to Toys 'R' us and make sure you have your amazon receipt and they will take it back. This makes it a lot easier than trying to mail her back or talk so service people who dont know what is going on.Anyway she is a cute doll and my 2 and 1 year old love her!! We bought 2 of them, it is definatly worth it if you get one that works!!"
3,Pretty Cute,"This turned out to be a wonderful gift for my 3 year old. She has a very uncommon name (from Bible) and Dora actually pronounces it correctly. My daughter really gets a kick out of hearing Dora say her name (I must admit that I am pretty tickled myself!). We also found a name very closely resembling her older cousin's. Of course, she just thinks it's creepy (teenagers?!? :-) One thing, I had a most awful time trying to get the speaker back in. I had to snip some of the stitching so it would fit. It still seems to kind of bust out the back. The velcro doesn't quite close all the way. I still totally recommend this toy! Especially at the awesome price it went for last Christmas!!!! Almost $10 cheaper than the other stores (even Wal-Mart) INCLUDING SHIPPING!!!"
2,DRAWING STYLE AND HUMOR DATED AND PROBABLY USELESS,"While I value some of his other drawing books, this one is an after-the-fact compilation of old work that is hopelessly dated and is not likely to be of any use to any artist working today. It may have value for those who need to do a drawing in a long-abandoned style, but for most of us it is no loss that this book is out of print. Also, the laughs promised in the title never materialize. In short the book falls far short of the promise in its title."
2,Good if you are a complete newbie in this area,"I had some expectations for this book, but it was not exactly what I had hoped for. Partially useful, but overall I could live without it."
4,Ronnie is always best live,"Although there is a studio CD Slide On This, I'd recommend the live disc....not all the same songs either. Ronnie keeps living his rock and roll life and as much as he is driven, he does a better job solo than Keith ever could....on this one he uses Bernard Fowler and Ian McLagan from the Stones machine. There are 7 of his own songs, one from Dylan, 2 that he wrote with Rod Stewart (Gasoline Alley & Stay With Me) and his Stones song Pretty Beat Up (which the Stones did even though they labeled the studio tapes ""dog s____"")....the tracks are from his 92-93 tour at the Ritz in NY, Avalon in Boston and at Budokan in Japan.....a great dose of Ronnie's guitar, lyrics, and slide, slide, slide.....and he even ends with a dose of his Faces days....finishes with a very nice version of Stay With Me."
2,Not a real dodo,"This book was a big let down. The main character, the dodo, isn't a real dodo. The illustrator wouldn't know a dodo bird if it bit her."
4,"Hot, playful book","The photographs and the women are beautiful. The tone is hot and still playful.The only thing that I was unhappy with was that the book's dimensions are a bit small. I think of a wider book when I think of a ""coffee table book."" (I can't recall where I heard that said.) As a consequence, the photographs which are 2 full pages look a bit odd, as they are cut through the middle by the seam of the book. It's not like a magazine that lays flat- this is a thick book. And, of course, the photographs that command two-page spreads are some of the best, so it's really quite a loss."
4,"fun size book, delightful and ho so sexy","i haven't really noticed the size of the book when i ordered it (let that be a lesson to me, always remeber to do so) and i kind of expected somthing coffee book size, i don't know if i would dare spend that amount on somthing that's reading book size, but i'm really glad that i did.this is a very nice and tempting book, it's made into several scenes each alaborated and very intence showing women in SM oriented scenes both as the controler and the controled while as the book goes the maids and slavegirls take revenge of their misstresses and tormentores. all this done in a playful mouthwatering sexy ways. i haven't been so turned on from photography for a long time. i love those grainy black and whites, it just give everything such a dirty erotic feel!"
3,"Fun Book, But Small Format","I like the collection of photos in here: there's nice light themed images that tell a ""story"" of sorts through pictures. The outfits are appealing as are the models. My main complaint is that the size of the book is too small. My feeling is that art/photo books should be larger in format so the viewer can pick up and take in more of the details."
5,Great book for beginners and advanced fighters alike,"""It's got great details. Kid and Rodrigo show moves to be practiced by white belts and Black Belts. They show moves that we all know, but show little details that we all forget to do when doing basic moves. They also show moves that you probably haven't seen before and need to be used in your BJJ............. For all to read and improve your BJJ!!!Congats to both Kid and Rodrigo on this book!"
3,Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Master Techniques: The Essential Guard (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Master Techniques series),Its ok but I was hoping for some escapes from guard as well and there seems to be none in this book.
3,It is not a great film but it depicts history as it happened,"The DVD is high quality and played well with good sound, what bothered me was the nudity in the film/"
3,review of mastering finnish,"the cd is very challenging, is structured in blocks of straight finnish, and is supposed to be used with a written text (need to purchase separately, not available together?). I was a little disappointed as I was hoping to have a cd to listen to in the car, and I half expected the cd to have an english phrase, a finnish phrase, followed by another english phrase, a finnish phrase etc etc."
3,A bit confusing,"This is the first book that I bought in trying to learn Finnish. Along with this book I bought a Finnish to English dictionary. I found myself searching around the book and my dictionary constantly looking for words in the text. I got frustrated with this book and bought Teach Yourself Finnish by Terttu Leney, and it was a MUCH better book for learning Finnish. But still, there were gaps. I also bought Finnish, an essential grammer which filled in the gaps.So my suggestion, is that if you want to learn Finnish, buy a Finnish to English dictionary, Teach Yourself Finnish by Terttu Leney, and Finnish: an essential grammer."
