2,The Last Bad Vampire Movie,"Talking about Suckers! (Not the Vampire Kind). I am one for falling for the nice tittle. Silly fight scenes, bad Acting and ridiculous specials effects make this Movie really terrifying to seat thru. Save yourself 4 bucks, and go watch reruns of True Blood until the next season starts."
1,Stick with the anmie,"While the look of the film is decent (neon-lit, rain-blown alleys; misty oriental landscapes) the plot is predictable & the characters two dimensional. I'm not expecting something on par w/Kurosawa here, but come on. Finally, can someone declare a moratorium on the use of CGI to depict blood erupting from wounds? It seems like exploding Lava lamps, for crying out loud.The film looks shot like it's a mid-90's music video, the acting, while really not important, mostly consists of what sounds like phonetic readings of the script, the 1970 setting is pointless and the story is just a jumbled mess that made a lot more sense in the original anime."
2,...Seen it all before...,"Half Vampire/Human out to kill the master Vampire...Yawn..seen it all before. I was unimpressed by this movie. I found myself checking the clock half way thru. The Lead character was likable but the american girl in this movie was annoying! The fight scenes in this movie was barely entertaining, even the Boss fight at the end of the movie was disappointing. One thing i HATE about movies nowadays is the over use of CGI (Computer-generated imagery). The CGI was very good in this movie but it STILL looks fake like in most movies. RENTAL"
3,Colorful and Attractive Picture + Lots of action + Animated Bloody Scene + Lovely Actress = Worth watching.,"- The movie is colorful and attractive.- There's a lot of action. The actions are okay. At first glance, they look bloody but they're not. It's because anytime blood is flying or a head is cut off, the director makes it clearly look like an animated scene.- The main actress looks lovely but not convincing as a swordwoman.- In short, it's worth watching but not buying."
3,Deleted Scenes?,"I liked how they included some scenes from the Blood: The Last Vampire anime in this movie.The action scenes were pretty good. Lots of wire work. It looks like Gianna did most of her own stunts.The story seemed like it was missing a few scenes. In the making of featurettes we see pieces of a scene with Saya fighting in a meat locker and another with her fighting two afro vampires. These scenes are not in the main movie. Unfortunately there are no deleted scenes on the extras menu, unless they're hidden as an easter egg that I was not able to find.Unresolved plot threads and missing scenes aside, this was an OK movie. Watch it mostly for the action scenes."
1,Simply terrible,"I am going to make this as quick as possible, this movie was horrible. Not even the action was up to par! I watched this movie with low expectations (as I watch all movies), and was suprised that someone was creating this movie, and after a scene was filmed actually said ""good cut guys, that was a great scene"". It just was really bad and I cannot think of one positive thing about it. The blood animations was silly, there were no hot chicks, the action was bad, the script was bad, there was just nothing good about it. As I watched it I was only entertained at how bad it got and I just bashed the movie scene by scene. If you have the time to watch this movie dont waste it."
1,Not for fans of the anime..,If you liked the anime movie or series this live action is a huge waste of time.
1,Bull.crap. Worst movie I have seen.,"Crappy Acting. Crappy Effects. Crappy story line. Hardly any action, That looks like crap. And its just not worth your 2 hrs."
1,"Dont bother with this, GO watch the Anime film its based on","About 30 minutes into this movie I realized one thing: why did I bother to rent it. About 15 minutes after that I realized a second thing: what else is on TV right now. Yep, after about 45 minutes I took the disk out and put it back in the netflix sleeve, shipping it back the next morning. This movie pretends to be based on the hit anime movie of the same name, but therein do the similarities begin and end. Save yourself the time (I am sure your time is as valuable as mine) and rent/buy/watch the original anime movie. Even if you are not a fan of anime I promise you, its a far superior movie to this one, in every way."
1,Don't waste your money.,"Connections are lost with this hub several times a day. After only 10 days, I trashed this unit for a Kensington brand. The difference is like night and day. All 7 of the USB connections are being used on the Kensington with 100% efficiency!!"
2,A middling text that doesn't translate well to audio,"This book is intended for fledgling entrepreneurs, and as such its title is somewhat misleading. Rather than discussing obscure ""loopholes"" in United States tax law, it concentrates on relatively basic business structure and investment strategies. The abridged version is very short, and the presentation tends to degrade into little more than descriptions of different types of corporations, and other fundamental information obtainable from resources far better than this.I do not recommend the CD audio version of the book. I found author Diane Kennedy's flat, tinny reading voice and artificial inflection to be grating and unaccommodating. Unfortunately, even when Kennedy is insightful and objective, the book's dialogue and narration sound like a 1950s educational film."
1,Pokemon,"This book is garbage really your attacking a video game that promotes friendship above all and to make this about religion is ridiculous half your information on pokemon is false and it is insulting to the people who made the game please do some basic research before writing a book i'm all for ""religion"" and ""church"" but come on people you have to cram it down everyone's throat its a game let your kid play it or don't no need to write a book on amazon selling for $0.01.... have a blessed day!"
1,Horrible Ideas,"What ever happened to Christian Love? Tolerance? not shoving the Bible down people's throats?This book is a prime example of this. Tolerance is a key thing for religions, we people can live the way we want.Now, on to the Pokemon! I am, and have been for a couple of years, a Pokemon Fanatic, but unlike some of the other reviewers, i was banned from playing Pokemon for quite some time, that is until i got it from my friend for Christmas, and i sneaked it away and began playing it! and i discovered a new world. I started to hang out with my friends today, who also loved Pokemon. so that is how i got into playing Pokemon.Now, about this book, It is full of lies and slander. So if you are going to buy this book, just stop and consider for a moment if you will, Do you believe in Elitism and Those that are Different are Evil? if you don't then please for the love of all that is holy don't buy this book!"
2,Pokemon?,"I can understand about the other shows, but Pokemon? There is nothing wrong with Pokemon. It has nothing to do with witchcraft or anything like that. And besides, the pocket ""monsters"" are cute and aren't even scary. The pokeballs are made by pure advanced technology, no witchcraft. Why is it bad? The show even has a few morals, good morals, mixed in with the show. There isn't that much violence like DragonBall Z or SailorMoon, soo....."
1,:\,"If it were up to me, I wouldn't have given it a star at all. Where is there evil in Pokemon? Can someone tell me?Each episode of the television show has a message, Ash has a dream to strive to be the best in what he loves to do. That's a positive message if I've ever heard one.Take for instance, this one episode which showed that everybody in the ""pokemon"" universe were being watched by the three legendary Pokemon for when humans and Pokemon. Humans and Animals, work and co-exist as one, if that isn't a good thing or a positive message, then I don't know what is.You tell us to open our eyes ... well open yours.( Little edit: LILO AND STITCH?! ... Geez. You people. Attack something that deserves it. )"
1,Right...,"Sort of sad when an author is nonsensically threatened by a succesful toy franchise, don't you think?Anything popular with children seems to be automatically labled as 'evil' nowadays by these types.Ignore this book completey, not worth your or anybody's time."
1,Smearing America's Soldiers,"The very real atrocity at My Lai conditioned Americans to accept accounts of brutality on the part of this nation's soldiers, but not all claims of atrocity are real, and Mark Lane has assembled a bunch of bogus and unreliable accounts in this book. It is so bad that anti-war journalist Neil Sheehan took Lane to task in the NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW. See:http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/smearing.htm"
4,Marching to a different drum,"When I first started reading this book I thought it was good and interesting, but nothing major was really happening. Then about 3/4 of the way through I was completely shocked at the turn of events. I just sat there staring at the pages in complete disbelief that this author had the courage to do something this extreme and drastic. Now, obviously I can't tell you what she did, but I can tell you that it will make your eyes glued to the pages until the end of the book. This is an awesome series to read. I just started the fourth book and the plot makes your heart race starting from the first few pages. You won't regret reading this series."
3,Depressing.,"This book will make you not want to become a Christian. Nothing but pain, suffering, mind battles, and assumptions. ""In all thy getting, get an understanding."" Why write and quote scriptures yet disregard the most obvious.I was never inspired reading this book. It is sad, and depressing. Nothing good ever happens, only tragedy, after tragedy, after trouble, and that's not including the horrible thing she does to several of her characters. Poor guys life was full of turmoil and then............ Ridiculous!I will not read another book from this series that started off so great! Too much sorrow. Some bad is good, but this book was way to much!Also I loved Abby until this book. Her character was wonderful then she turns into a mean, vicious. black hearted and unreasonable person, and the writer justifies it all by saying she went through too much that turned her bitter. Couldn't stand her in this book."
5,A great book! You won't want to put it down!,This is a great book. Abbie has to face the worst tragedy of her life. I love these books I hope there will be alot more coming. Keep it up Kristen!
5,9-inch silicon gasket for Fagor pressure cooker,The item was received sealed and in new condition. It was the right size. The measurement was slightly confusing with the difference in measuring scales between the US and the rest of the world. It was made easier with only 2 sizes to choose from. Suggest resellers use both measuring scales in their ads.
5,Pressure Cooker Gasket,Not too much that you can say about a foolish pressure cooker gasket except that it works. I belive the new silicon gaskets will be much better than the original.
5,Performs as expected,"I have a combo set (4 quart and 8 quart with single lid) of fagor pressure cookers. Over the years the old gasket was worn out and I stopped using the pressure cookers. Recently I started cooking things that take forever to cook (meats with tough tendons) and wanted to use the cookers again. With Amazon, searching for gaskets was easy. The tough part was making sure the size of the gasket. When I first looked at all the online information, including Fagor's, it seems that the combo set would require 10"" gaskets. Thank goodness for another reviewer somewhere on the web that provided the best way to determine size - measure the inside diameter of your cooker! If the inside diameter is < 10"", use 9"". If > 10"", use 10"". In terms of performance, this silicon gasket works just as it should - good. My only hope is this one lasts longer than the 2 years the old one did."
2,hmm,"Everything I researched said that this item would fit my ""casa essentials' pressure cooker. However, it is too hefty and won't fit. I've searched, but cannot find the slim flexible gasket that came with the cooker, that I have used all of twice. Shame."
1,Product description is not true,"The product description isn't true. It says it is 9"" which it isn't, it's 9 3/4"". So here I sit with a true 9"" 6qt pressure cooker and a Fagor gasket that will not fit the top though it says it will."
5,Worked fine out of the box,Worked as advertised. Used low current trigger from receiver to trigger amp - relay was able to perform as diagramed.
5,Great product,"Works well, easy to implement... what else can I say? Been using it for custom serial-port activated alarm system. A little coding using free MS Visual Studio Express and iSpy connect software (also free)... result = fancy but cheap alarm system!"
5,Un gran grupo!!!!!!!!,Yo soy the Chihuaha I me encanta escuchar su musica. Tengo muchos de sus cassettes I todos me encantan. Ellos tienen un gran ritmo cual lo interpretan a traves de su musica. Los quiciera felicitar por su gran trabajo que lo estan haciendo muy bien. Sigan adelante!!!!!
4,Most Interesting,Good starter book for those interested in what drawings can help you learn about a person's feelings. Gives insight into stages of development as well.
1,Professional Home Design Suite,"Save your money. I have wasted three hours on a Sunday trying to figure out how to create a non-rectangular-shaped foundation with a wrap-around porch, have searched online help and the manual for ""porch"" with no results, and of course, tech support is only open Monday-Friday.I consider myself a fairly savvy software user, and in fact, am in software marketing for a living. This is one of the most user-spiteful programs I have ever seen.I wish I had my money back."
2,Plant database is hard to use.,"One of the more frustrating parts of using Punch is plant selection. One has to select from pictures that are scrolled down the right side of the screen. Down in the lower left hand side of the screen is the name of the plant being displayed. One should be able to type in the name of the plant and have the picture displayed, rather than the other way around. The database of plants, while seemingly large, is quite sparse, and is especially weak on native plants, which are of increasing importance in contemporary landscape architecture."
1,Ragtime Rediscoveries,"I completely agree with Servaas. It is absolutely absurd to offer a ""collection"" of something without telling what is IN that collection. I am looking for a very old, very specific composition but I am not willing to buy a collection of anything unless I know for sure that it has what I am looking for - or maybe even something else that I MIGHT be interested in."
1,too little information,"Why is there not al list of the works collected in this book, on your webpage. That makes it quite impossible to look for a certain piece. And it doesn't make me want to buy any of these scorebooks, since I don't know what is in them."
2,Outdated Book,"This book is outdated. The cases in the book all seem to be at least 15 years old, with some being much older than that."
3,What am I Paying over 15 Dollars For Again?,"Okay, it has a price tag of over $15 and comes in a tiny bottle compared to your regular shampoo you can buy at the super market. I used it several times and I can't find it ""extreme smoothing"". I got better results with the El'Vital shampoos (also by L'Oreal), which I cannot find anywhere to buy anymore (why is that?). The problem is, that ""Expert Liss"" cost 3-4x as much as their El'Vital series shampoos.The shampoo is alright, but the price is not IMO. Don't expect any miracles or super special results from using it. Spend your money on the much lower priced L'Oreal shampoos, such as El'Vital (if you can find it anywhere, let me know)."
3,"OK, but a little boring - Relaxed Dinner Music","I like most of the Putumayo CD's, but this one is a little sleepy. It's great to listen to before bed, or maybe while reading. Maybe even good music to compliment a quiet dinner (with wine of course). But, if you're looking for something up beat then one of their latin dance CD's are a better choice."
1,Very High Level - discusses more on the league setup,"I bought this thinking it would be for an introductory coach.... it is more on the rules and very high level. for example the book reads - ""make sure you get the right bat for the batter"" and does not explain how to measure right bat height......same is true for the height of the tee...... disappointing.I'm going to buy another book......"
5,little league drills & strategies,"a very good & informative book for coaches who coach from u12 down.this book is very easy to understand,making it suitable for rookie coaches"
4,Cool Shade,"A few hard to believe scenes with the muffler and cop, but overall a good story with the odd twist at the end."
2,Not for me,"I did not enjoy reading Cool Shade. In all fairness to the author Theresa Weir, I am not a romance novel lover. I enjoy suspense, but Cool Shade had too much romance and too much explicit sex for my taste. I'm not a prude, but for me, when the sex is that explicit, it looses a lot of its appeal.Cool Shade won the RITA award for romantic suspense for a reason. The writing was good, the characters complex. I did have a couple of problems with the story line however. I don't want to write a spoiler, so I won't go into detail, but I felt there were a couple of incidences that were totally unbelievable and out of character.While I didn't enjoy Cool Shade, I am sure there are plenty of romance lovers out there that will enjoy this novel very much."
2,Poorly developed story line and characters,"The story had real promise, but the story line seemed disjointed and the romance of the main characters seemed implausible."
3,JUST OKAY,"I didn't especially care for this book. The characters didn't interest me too much, nor did the subject."
5,Dark'ish but very good,"The story line here is a little slow to get started, but when it gets going it is captivating. This book looks as the effects of loneliness and fear, not only on a life, but on a person's dreams. I was really pleased with the ending as it was a true ending. I appreciate the author taking the time to wrap up the loose ends and then give the reader the ending the story needed rather than just the ""happily ever after"" that many books have offered."
2,Weird,"This book was just weird. The main characters were very unlikeable. A wandering, can't-hold-down-a-job, mousey girl meets a prostitute-loving, drunk recluse. The storyline about the missing sister is what kept me from totally giving up on this book, but that part was done and over without the main character even doing any real investigating or trying to find her. **Spoiler** The sister just shows back up. It felt very anti-climatic and weak. The worst part of this book, BY FAR, was the main character having sex with recluse drunk the second time she sees him, even though she's a virgin (posing as a prostitute to see him again..??) and he's drunk... and it's over in like 3 seconds. Uhhh, what? What a romantic story!"
4,Cool Shade,The book keeps you wondering what is going to happen next.It is almost a mystery but not the scary kind.
4,Good read,Hold your interest can not wait for the next page and the dialogue keeps you wanting more. Recommend that others check it
4,"So good, I wanted to read more","Even though this book did not have any mystery or intrigue in the plot to keep the suspense moving, the characters and the love story pulled me along. I couldn't put the book down until I had read the last page. Even then, I wanted more. It was the type of contemporary romance that you might see made into a movie aired on lifetime or maybe with a little more humor the big screen. It was touching and enjoyable to read. It is exactly the type of book you would want to read if you need to escape reality for a while and just get absorbed in romance."
1,NOT WELL WRITTEN. NOT EVEN WORTH 1 STAR!,"THIS WAS MY FIRST BOOK BY MS. WEIR AND I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. THE STORY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SO HARD TO FOLLOW IF THE AUTHOR DIDN'T HAVE TO PUT CHAPTER 30 NEAR THE END. AS IT WAS, IT CAME OFF AS TERRIBLY DULL AND CONFUSING. EDDIE SOUNDED LIKE A WACKO AND MADDIE SOUNDED LIKE A MASOCHIST. Nora Roberts is much better."
5,Good quick read,I really enjoyed this book. The mixture of mystery and romance was perfect for me. I liked the characters as well.
5,Great book,I would recommend this book to all of my friends.The story line is about the love of one sister and the deceit and greed of the other.
5,Kept me interested!,Cool Shade was a very good short story! It kept my attention thoughout the whole book. I won't talk to much about the content because I don't want to ruin the book for others but I would recommend reading it!
3,Nothing special,"This was okay, it could use a new product discription because its not so much about finding her sister at all- it was still an okay book, however, nothing special"
4,Sweet read,"This is an easy read. Good plot, intro, a few hot scenes and ending well.Thank you for the time it to to write Theresa Weir~"
5,Loved it!,I really loved this book. It was an exciting story with drama and romance. I may even read it again soon.
3,Easy read,Finished this book in one day. It made me laugh and made me cry. Always love a happy ending don't you?
5,"Wow, awesome book.","Wow, what an awesome book. Great addition to my library collection. Exactly as listed, but better than expected. Shipped quickly, too."
2,"In-House Bio, Only So-So","This is a very ordinary in-house biography of the legendary street writer Donald Goines. The book came out shortly after Goines's death (in 1974) and was commissioned by his very own publisher (Holloway House), likely as a means of capitalizing on their star author's underground fame.Some corporate bias is evident here, with the biographer Eddie Stone extolling Holloway House's role in Goines's life. Moreover, Stone's glossing of each novel's plot can get tiresome -- it's like having to listen to a high-school book report on Kenyatta when in fact you'd rather just read about Kenyatta himself.Check out Eddie Allen's more recent Low Road (2004) for a far more balanced account of Goines's life."
2,"Eddie Stone ""Don't Know Much About Geography""","A decent read, but I couldn't get past Stone's references to Lake Michigan. ""Gray clouds covering Detroit from Lake Michigan"", ""A cold wind blowing off Lake Michigan"", ""It was a cold day on the shores of Lake Michigan."" What the heck was Stone talking about? The City of Detroit is about as close to Lake Michigan as Phoenix, Arizona is to the Pacific Ocean. There's a Detroit RIVER...and there's Lake Huron and Lake Erie....but it takes a few hours and a few hundred miles to get to Lake Michigan from Detroit. If he couldn't get THAT right, I have to wonder about the rest of his research..."
5,Disney Quality,This anecdote reminds me of Disney Quality Cartoon movies. I believe this should be made a movie.
3,A Little Better Than A Circle Is Cast,"Just like their other album, it includes songs about the Judeo-Christian Deity. If I wanted that I'd buy one of the countless albums about Jesus! And like A Circle Is Cast the songs are too short and somewhat hard to understand.To be honest, Libana kind of reminds me of Enya who I'm also not crazy about."
2,"Nice idea, poorly executed.","The idea of the Ashbory Fretless Electric Bass is, in my opinion, wonderful. A very tiny instrument that produces a very big sound is incongruous, in a good way. It creates great stage presence because of the seeming disconnect between size and sound. But, the the fretboard should be wider to enhance playability. The strings are relatively thick, and given the narrow fretboard, it is virtually impossible for me to use my normal playing style, which is plucking with forefinger and middle finger (and sometimes third finger). But the ultimate frustration is that the strings do not remain in tune. I can overcome the shortcomings of the fretboard, but when I constantly have to retune the strings, the situation becomes unbearable. Of course, because the instrument is fretless, tuning isn't really the major problem I'm suggesting it is, but since I'm a position player, if the strings detune, the positions constantly change. Well, that's frustrating for me."
4,A great movie,"I first saw this movie when I recorded it off of my DISH about 3 years go. I though it was great and was glad that I had taped it. I accidently taped over it though soon after and have since put this movie out of my mind, until today that is. For some reason the song from the movie popped into my head today, and now I have to order it just to see it again. I must admit this movie isn't for everone, but if you like movies such as ""Dased and Confused"" or ""When the Party is Over"" this is a little known must have."
2,Bad movie but not the worst,The movie was bad. It is hard to tell why the guy jumped off the cliff. I understand that it is from the 80s though but the movie was not what I expected it to be. I wish they had a more modern version of this.
2,After School Special-icious!,"I caught this film off cable a couple years ago. It is overwhelmingly cliche, but fun despite its corniness. Some of the music is good, one song, though melodramatic, ""Wishing on Another Lucky Star,"" performed near the end, is absolutely beautiful, and worth the viewing just to hear performed. All in all the film is so-so, it's just a little cheesy, but not mean spirited or vapid. Hey, it was the 80s, Keanu Reeves is in the movie playing a grief stricken version of his ""Bill and Ted's,"" character (huge surprise), what more can be expected? Basically, it is a very polished (in that 80s way which is barely) after school special. Don't expext any emotional revelations from it. If you're looking for a touching movie about grief, see ""Ordinary People"" (or the wonderful, ""Imaginary Crimes"" with Fairuza Balk), if you want to see a good 80s movie, catch ""Some Kind of Wonderful,"" but if you just want to see a watchable movie with a few cute, sappy moments, this flick is for you!"
3,Touching,A story about a group of teens in the 80's who struggle with the suicide of their friend who seems to have it all. Keanu Reeves plays the part of his best friend who goes through a series of emotions ranging from anger to guilt. I believe Keanu's acting in this movie is one of the stepping stones to a career that can claim him the complimentary box office title that he sincerely deserves.
5,The most emotional work Mr. Reeves has ever done,"I do not have to write a lot about this movie accept to say it was moving, rare, deep and brilliant. Most people are not going to understand or get this movie. I can tell by watching people every day, talking to them, personal experience, and by doing online surveys. They may ""like"" something, but it does not mean they truly understand it or grasp the meaning that most miss in this movie. I do not nor will I divulge why the person took their own life in this movie because it is a thinking and feeling movie, something that is not very popular or grasped in reality in this world. And this type never truly has been. The song that was sung solo near the end of this movie is absolutely beautiful, sweet and rare which makes the whole movie even better. One of the best EVER and in the top ten of my favorites for sure and always will be. You just do not see this anymore.Ernie MinkDenver, CO 80229"
2,Not what i expected ~ not as displayed.,"Cute, but not as displayed on this site! I wanted it with the stones display on the box.which were green stones. But it came w/stones i could have gotten from my backyard."
3,"I think three stars is a litle over rated, but...","It's ok. I've been wanting a Zen garden for a while, and after reading a lot of reivews, even though this one had problems, I still decided to take a chance. The box is very beautiful in my opinion, there is plenty of sand, and no where did it advertise jade rocks (like other reviews have suggested), but yes, stuff did arrive broken. The broom's head was snapped off and the larger bird had both its wings snapped. The birds are made in a very fragile ceramic. Nothing I can't glue at home....but I paid $27 to not have to glue anything together. I'm going to keep it, but Toysmith needs to find a different way to ship the fragile parts....or use a better adhesive."
5,ZEN GARDEN,"I was so excited when I recieved my Zen Garden!!! Very fast shipping and very nice product! After reviewing other comments and ratings, I knew this was the safest buy. It was larger than I expected and I enjoy the peaceful movements of the white sands. Great price with FREE SHIPPING! Can't beat that!"
5,Zen,"Nice garden, good size, nice looking wood and comes with little birds and rocks that add to you zen. I would suggest not letting little ones near it though unless you're planning to get more sand."
4,not jade rocks,"I loved the box and tools, they look very nice, cute cranes and all, but the rocks are the plain , dull sort, not the glowing jade advertised. just to let you know...."
3,Deluxe Zen Garden,"The description for this product is incorrect. The rocks that are included are rocks like those found in your driveway. They are NOT Jade rocks as described. Also, the wooden box is wobbly because one leg is shorter then the others. Aside from these issues the product was acceptable."
4,good baseball tips,My son is in tee ball so I purchased this book as well as its predecessor for tee ball. This book was very useful and had some interesting drills for young children. I recommend this book for anyone with a child who has an interest in baseball.
5,"Chirpa rules -- after all, he's the chief...","This is a must-have toy for any ""Star Wars"" action figure collector. The sculpting on this little fellow is outstanding. Chief Chirpa is an accurate reproduction of the Ewok from ""Return of the Jedi"".Fans had been waiting quite a while for this one when the manufacturer announced that it would be released this year as part of the successful ""The Saga Collection"" line of action toys from Hasbro. Chirpa was one of the few characters from the original assortment of ""Star Wars"" figures not yet re-made in the modern, post-1995 era.And the wait was worth it...!The figure is not only sculpted quite nicely, the coloring is also fantastic -- so are the accessories. He comes with a detailed staff and a tiny Ewok knife that fits into an equaly tiny shaft on his belt.Wow -- what a great figure! Go! Buy it!"
4,BETTER THAN EVER,this gets a 4 1/2my dad is a designer for the game. it does not look as well as nfl2k4 but it plays better. owner mode is awsome there are millions of different stadium designes. ive played it and the controls are fluid and easy to learn basics. there r better plays tho choose from the rosters r more updater than nfl2k4 which didnt include the unsinged draft picks.buy it
5,Madden NFL,I have never played Madden NFL 2004 but I have all the previous Madden NFL games for Playstation 2. In my opinion Madden NFL 2003 is one of the best games so far for PS2(When 2004 comes out it will probably be). Every time a Madden game comes out I buy it the first day it is released. When I play the game I think there is no way they could improve this game but somehow they find a way. 2004 is probably the most improved from what I've heard. I would be the first one in line to buy it.
4,Best Football Game Yet,"best football game i have ever playedi love the playmaker especially on defense but the hot routes on o r kool 2 u can send t.o. on a fly 2 burn some db its greatthe owner mode is awesome, havin total control over ur franchise is kewlthe only problem is that some mini camp drills are too hard like swat ballotherwise its an awesoem game"
2,madden nfl 2004,"With all the talk about how great madden is, i though i had to get it and try it, but to my disappointment I found it boring. It's not even fun, the gameplay, the card thing is dumb. I would recommend espn 2004."
4,Best football game ever,"Now, Madden actually had some competition this year. As in Espn NFL football. In my opinion madden beats it down with ease. The owner mode is awsome. I like raising the price of popcorn to like 20$.Overall i give this game a 9.75 out of 10. have fun with this game."
1,Fun for a while. Then you just don't play it.,There is no Defense in the game and you don't really feel like your skill can do anything to help on defense. You can't control DBs well so its better to just let the computer do it and they can be picked a part by any Human with a little experience with Madden.Offense is all about who has the fastest players and getting it to them which is easy because every QB in the game has the ability to make throws that shouldn't be possibe.
4,Somethings are to easy,"Madden 2003 was way to hard to get interceptions. Now 2004's interception is way to easy. This game is great but i think Interceptions, deep passes, and catches are to easy. But overall this Game is better then the rest."
3,Historic teams?,"I like Madden 2004 but am very disappointed with the historic teams option. When you select a team ex: Redskins '83' they don't use the players names. You would expect to see the players names since that is why your probably playing in that option...to see some of your old favorites like John Riggins etc. However, they only use numbers, worst of all, the teams don't even have the real player jersey numbers being used. None of the players have their correct numbers...what's the point! Other than EA giving the ""team"" a grade comparable to the team that played during that year, you really lose any connection with that team."
5,Madden NFL 2004,"Although I have not played the new Madden, I think it looks like a wonderful game. I have bought the Madden Games since 2000, and I will continue this tradition for years. If you buy the games regularly every year, I recommend getting it. The new Owner Mode looks very fun, in which you price the tickets, concessions, and parking. You can also hire a coaching staff to fit the needs of your team. One of the best features is that you can design your own stadium from the seats to the scoreboard. The Playermaker mode looks interesting, letting you change the routes of receivers, and the direction of your blockers before and after the ball is snapped. I have not heard if there is an Online Multiplayer Mode for the game but I assume there would be. If you have played a Madden Game and liked it, I suggest you buy this game. If you havent tryed it, $50.00 is a bit of money for a 1st timer but I still recommend it."
5,Best Sports game yet,"Madden 2004 is the best sports game ever made. Disregard all reviewers complaining about interceptions. If you think there's too many, go to A.I. and lower the interceptions. The owner mode is unbelievable. Playmaker isnt that great, but worth using once in a while. The graphics and animations are the best Ive ever seen, just amazing. Theres so many different details that you can do. Such as changing current uniforms and adding an Irish Pub to your stadium. Or sponsor your field or even relocate to another city! This is a must buy game. If theres any game to buy other than this i guess NCAA football 2004 is acceptable because College football is way better than the NFL. If there is one problem there is way to many fumbles and you cant control that.MADDEN 2004 IS A MUST BUY!"
5,"wow, what a game. But it may have some bugs.","i went out to buy this game because i saw how good the reviews were. I'm right in there with all those people who liked it.This game was awesome. The graphics are definitely a step up from 2003, and the challenge mode always corrects bad calls.The franchise and owner mode rock. Franchise puts you in charge of every aspect in your team, and the salary cap and rejected trades keep your team from becoming a dynasty. Owner mode is just icing on the cake.The only tiny glitch i found is once you get the madden cards you then get abosutely zip and you can't use them. The Ask Madden feature in gamecalling is good, except he never knows what he is talking about.The announcing is a step up from 2003, but the game is still great! Who cares about announcing. You're playing the game and while it is cool to hear them compliment you, they keep re-using phrases.But like i said, who cares about commentating. THis is everything i expected from madden and more"
4,madden nfl 2004,After playing this game i thought it was so bad. Ive played madden and it got better and better but now it is horable.
3,Gameday is better,"madden 2002 is a solid game,i mean 2004,my bad,almost the same game,just a updated roster and owner mode,which is tight,but the game plays to stiff,the cpu does most the work for you,game plays great online,but gameday has way more online features than madden,i love both,they both like rule ya heard:)"
1,Piece of Garbage,"It's the same old game year after year and the graphics don't improve. The only difference is the coverboy. Make the switch and buy ESPN NFL Football (aka NFL 2K4), which has a brand-new First Person mode (play from the player's view) and is a ton better."
5,OWN(er Mode) This Game,"Madden 2004 is the 14th installment of the greatest football series EVER. From the screenshots that I have seen, the graphics look just as amazing, if not more amazing, than last year's graphics.The best thing about this new game is called Owner Mode. This mode allows YOU to own the team, YOU hire the staff, YOU build the stadium, YOU set ticket prices, and YOU hand out signing bonuses, yes, SIGNING BONUSES!!!Other features include a new pre-snap play read, route changes, etc., new player details down to REPLICA TATOOS, and the ALL-NEW EA SPORTS Talk*.This game will be the best of the series thus far...I'm looking foward to playing the King of Football Videogames est. 1990-91 this August.*-(straight from EA SPORTS) Available on Playstation(R)2 with broadband capabilities only"
2,"Pretty graphics, pathetic control","This game is very over-hyped. You're better off going with ESPN football. Madden 2004's graphics are great, but player control is horrible, and the buttons are awkward and counter-intuitive. ESPN's interface is so much better. I bought madden first and seriously regret it, just a waste of $50 bucks. Its too bad you can't return games that [you do not like]."
4,AWESOME game to play on the SONY PLAYSTATION 2,"Madden NFL 2004 is going to be a REALLY TOTAL AWESOME game to play on the Sony Playstation 2 game system***THIS IS A MUST HAVE A GAME TO GET & PLAY ***I give it 5 Stars ""Highly Recommended"" REALLY TOTAL WORTH IT TO BUY & PLAY this game call Madden NFL 2004Madden NFL 2004 got GREAT REVIEWS"
5,Awsome!,This game is one of the best games out this year.The graphics are so real it almost blew me out of my skin!I bet you this game will compeate with anything out on the market today!
5,Best football game out,"This is the best football game out right now. The graphics are great. The gameplay is even better and the features are awesome, like create a team and owners mode and traning camp. Create a team is what I think the best feature in the game. With create a team you can make your own team and edit there jerseys and create a stadium for them. The only problem that I have with create a team is that in franchise mode you can't do owners mode, which allows to change the prices of tickets,food,jerseys,etc also it allows to upgrade the stadium and lets you view charts on fan support, etc. But the game is still great and is worth $50."
5,Nothing compares to madden,"Madden is by far the best game out there! Its way better than that espn garbage which i also own. This game has incredible features and nothing can even compare to it. I am tired of people who right reviews that say the AI cheats and they intercept everything and you can't run and blah blah blah... MAYBE ITS BECAUSE YOU SUCK AT THE GAME. Honestly i dont have any problem with the difficulty of this game, i mean all madden level can be tough at time but the 3 levels below that are a breeze. This is by far the best sports game to date."
1,playmaker is overrated,"playmaker is just plain stupid it didn't do anything to improve the game, it is the EXCACT thing as hot route. and it is really hard to guide a blocker during a run. the blocker is really stupid and blocks the wrong guy"
4,"a lot of fun, but i have a ?","overall, i think this game is a lot of fun. gameplay is a good pace and for the most part accurate. i've always been a fan of the creat-a-player feature on games, but this one has me a little confused...who wants to change the shape of your players butt?? i couldn't believe that was an option. but overall, i really enjoy playing this game."
1,PLEASE HELP ME!!!!,"After showing my 65 year old dad this game he became addicted. First he went put and bought a PS2. Then he bought this game. He played it so much that his wife of 35 years divorced him. He next tried to sell his house to buy a million PS2's. Now he is a poor old white bag, living on the streets of NYC, accompanied by a fat Korean man and a million PS2's!!"
1,This game bores me to death,"i fell asleep playing this game and almost died watching people play it. It is insult to to the game. If you like this game go play it, im not preventing u im trying to help u"
2,Buy ESPN/Sega Football 2K4- A SUPERIOR Game,"The Madden series has become very tiresome. ESPN Football 2K4 on the other hand is clearly the greatest PS2 football game ever. The sooner you figure that out, the sooner you'll realize that you've spent your $50 on the wrong game. Rent 2K4 from your local video store if you don't believe it's true. You will become a believer in Sega products all over again in very short order- if you have any sense at all."
5,IT ROX,"I'm not a big video game fan, but I love Good Charlotte and I'm pretty sure they had something to do with the game (2 guys in the band, have the name Madden) Anyway, I bought this game and it rox!!! The tunes on it are killer and it is just AWESOME. It's a must-have"
3,Be Careful READ My Review before you buy,"NOw im not like most of these reviewers, i actually bought the game, now the owner mode is great, BUT let me just tell you the load times are ridiculous. Plus if you bought madden 2003, you will remember that it was so simple even a child could go throught the franchise mode. This is so much more different and complicated. Mainly because they added bonus signings. But once again lisen from a reviewer who bought the game, this game is real good, but also slow and confusing."
5,The Best Football Game Yet!!!,"I loved this game. It's the best football game yet.The Graphics are great. There is an incredibly detaled Francise mode. In this theres an owner mode where you can hire and fire players and coaching staff members, set prices, move your team and create a stadiem for your self. You can even acsept or decline penaltys and challenge plays."
3,IF YOU HAVE 2003 DON'T GET IT!!!,"This game was a huge dissappointment. The box says is has over 100 new animations. Well, i haven't seen them. The commentary is the same as 2003 and the turnovers are crazy. During the last few minutes of play the cpu turns into a superteam and runs rampid on you. The new owners mode is not enough to make this game worth the price. If you have madden 2003, don't get it. If you don't have a madden title i guess it wouldn't be that bad to start with this one. Hopefully, 2005 will redeem the madden games."
1,Terrible game. Too Different from previous titles.,"This game just [bites]. Its way different than the previous maddens. I've been playing madden since 1996, and this one is nothing like the others. The game moves much faster, which leaves more room for error. Your quarterback gets picked 50 percent of the time, and the other half, you get sacked. I've played madden for years, and this is the most frustrating of any of them by far. I think i'm going to sell this and get espn 2004. Stick to Madden 2003, its much better."
4,In a word.....Incredible,"It has been a while since I've played a video football game, and I bought this for X-Box. I was completely blown away. The graphics, owner mode, challenging plays, playmaker, creating playbooks, its just endless what you can do with this game. The only thing that I would change are the crowds. It would be cool to kind of have a homefield advantage. I mean, when you are the Panthers playing in Charlotte against the Falcons, and the Falcons score, the crowd cheers like you just scored. They should boo, be silent, but definately not cheer! haha. Maybe if they had some kind of momentum meter that wasn't ridiculously one-sided, esp. for the home team. That is my only complaint, and that really doesn't amount to much, great job EA SPorts!! BUY THIS GAME!!"
4,Without a comparison...,"This sounds great, though I don't have much of a benchmark other than my 2001 version of the Pro-Ject 1.2. Incrementally better than that deck. Running it through a Lehman Black Cube from 2001, you get some nice frequency and instrument separation. My question: I always wondered if the fifties and sixties classical, jazz and rock producers contemplated a world where every bit of sound would be squeezed out of their master tapes. And is that squeezing necessarily an appropriate thing, given the producers didn't contemplate such a sound when mixing and mastering?Oh well, back to the real world. I love slapping the vinyl on this thing and passing the evenings with a beer and sweet tunes."
4,Men that we should know,"Not a great book, but many people don't know (or appreciate) the genius of Billy Durant. What is forgotten is that Mr. Durant put the pieces in place that Mr. Sloan built into the General Motors juggernaut -- so powerful that in the 1950s and 1960s, one of its biggest concerns was that the Justice Department would break it up, much like the Microsoft case, to bring the issues into current times. Durant was a fascinating visionary and character . . . Steven Jobs is the best comparison."
5,Couldn't put it down.,As a car buff growing up in the 1950's I was aware of the long shadow cast by Alfred Sloan on GM but I'd never heard of Billy Durant before. Was I in for a surprise to learn about the founder of GM and how he created and brought all the individual automobile brands together which formed the nucleus of this great car company. This was a page turner so to speak because I read it on my Kindle. I loved the book so much and it was such an easy ready that I read it twice and still learned new things. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in pioneers of large business and especially car buffs.
4,student book glencoe geometry,The book is in good condition and it arrived quickly. Very good price.hmc
5,Excellant book,"This is a must have for parents, caregivers, Nannies etc. I had gotten the book at the library to read & take notes etc. There was so much in this book, I had to get my own copy!!! I keep this book close by. Great resource to let parents of children in my care to look over too."
5,Excellent music!,"I'm no music expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I do know good music when I hear it. Bill Mumy has an extraordinary blend of rock/country/blues sounds that go back to my very roots. For me it's great 70's music morphed into today's world with a large portion of just plain, pure talent. It's not often I purchase a CD that doesn't have at least one song that's not quite up to the rest, but this CD is definitely the exception!Yes, Bill Mumy is ""Will Robinson"" from the 60's Lost in Space TV series - along with many other great acting roles - past and present. My only regret is that I spent so many years unaware of his remarkable musical talent.This is Mr Mumy's most recent album and I encourage all to purchase it. You will not regret it! And while you're at it do a little search of Mr Mumy's other albums. Each one is a musical treat worth much more than it's cost and each is a treasure all should have as well!"
2,Balanced Body Review,"I give this book two stars at most. I am an instructor and this book is part of our curriculum, and I feel that the book tries to incorporate way too many modalities into deep tissue work. The book is poorly organized for using it as a learning tool, and students have often complained that they ""get lost"" in reading the book, lecture and practice of the strokes. I also believe that the strokes are insufficient strokes for deep tissue therapy. There are also errors in names of anatomical structures, and the test bank online has incorrect answers listed as correct as well as questions that don't make sense in relating to the book material. As an instructor, I will not use this book again.In addition, with the mind body connections made in the book, claims are made regarding the beliefs and attitudes of people in relation to their posture. It is absolutely absurd to judge someone's beliefs based on their posture. Such claims should not be made."
3,Where can I get specific Asha Albums?,"Anyone can inform me where can I get/find the ""Fiery moon"" album from Asha (Dennis Quin)?Rgds JA"
1,NOPE,"My husband and I both tried for hours to use this program. First a foundation is required- without it you don't have any exterior walls. We found that the drawing tool is simply inadequate. If you make a mistake you are in many instances stuck with it and have to delete all of your work and begin again. The dimensional tool is a joke, you can't simply specify a wall dimension or an angle such as 45 degrees. After hours of work our foundation was an approximate representation, not an accurate one. I can't testify to the rest of the program, we never got beyond the foundation. Sorry we bought this!"
1,Mark Cauley must own stock in Broderbund,"I own the Professional Home Design suite and this was my second purchase of home design from Punch. I had hoped that the new package would work better than terribly poor - which is what I rate the first one. Unfortunately, my second purchase is just as disapointing. The software is purely a patch mess. Don't waste your money."
2,Awful,I purchased this software thinking it would be better than an old version of 3D Home V.3 I was currently using. What a joke. Do not waste your money. Very Difficult to navigate. limited fixtures. I could draw faster in ACAD 2002.
4,Good stuff,I is a little more complicated that it pro ports to be. it is pretty cool although you need to have some pretty serious construction knowledge to get a design to work.
1,1/2 Star Rating,I really didn't want to give the Punch Professional Home Design Platinum a 1 star rating but that was the lowest rating I could give. I am not a software engineer or an architect but have expereinced a life time of frustration for the $80 spent on the program.
1,"I've tried and tried, and could NOT get it to do anything","This software is a waste of money! BLECH! It doesn't even deserve 1 star -- it deserves 0 stars. If you ~MUST~ buy landscaping software, I SUPPOSE this MIGHT be okay. I found this software to be IMPOSSIBLE to use, ultimately getting nothing worthwhile or helpful out of it. What I felt was unabated frustration. It is definitely NOT user-friendly. My advise: Don't bother!~ I really wish there was a Macintosh version of affordable landscaping software (hardscape, softscape, plantings) costing under $75 or less. There probably ~USED~ to be such software, but Microsoft killed off the maker, as usual."
2,Nice except the radio reception is terrible,"This is a very nice and well designed unit except that the radio reception is weak. I bought it to use outside as I do yard work. It does not receive my favorite station, which comes in clearly on every other, even the cheapest radio I have."
5,"Comprehensive and wise ""self-education"" book","This book will help trauma sufferers and the mental health professionals who work with traumatized individuals. While filled with helpful advise, it moves beyond simple explanations and easy answers. It's not a ""light"" read, but it's well worth the effort. This is a healing and informative book for any reader who wants to understand the effects of trauma on the self and relationships."
4,Very Helpful,Even though the big is written as a text book it is very easy to read. The information is written in laymen's term so you don't need a PhD to understand it. I have not completed the book but have found it very helpful in understanding thing I never thought about. It's also a slow read so don't expect to read it in one sitting.
5,"Finally, a great dish drain!","I replaced my dish drains all the time - the wood ones were never big enough or the right shape, the cheapie plastic ones become cloudy and disgusting, the chrome ones got rusty, and most of the stainless ones had a plastic pan anyway. I was never happy until I found this one - it has all the features I was looking for - it holds a lot, looks great, and is smartly designed. Several visitors have commented on it. My mother was so impressed, she purchased herself one the next day. Worth the pricetag."
5,Still a hit after 3 years!,"So sue me. I paid $80 for a dish drainer because in my world function follows form. If you have the money (I did in '08) then go for it. The Zojila dish drainer works as well as it looks designerly and cool even after 3 years. Can you say the same about that ratty plastic thing-ie from your local discount store? What's more, my Zojila rack gives me the feeling it's never going to wear out--it's stainless STEEL for pete's sake. (No capital P till I find out who the oft quoted ""pete"" really is.) Again contrast and compare with your plastic dish holder. There's just one flaw: the utensil holder can be a pain. Oh well; form vs. function. If one could actually love something as silly as a dish rack, well, I'll say it: I love my Zojila Dish Rack Drainer! Kudos to Amazon for carrying this top quality item."
5,The best dishrack I've ever owned,"No problems with stability, and I can hardly see how this design can cause dishes to break (as other reviews suggest). I also get frequent questions about where I got this dish rack from my guests - so stylish it looks! We even start making jokes about it with my husband - because it sounds as if this dish rack is the most attractive thing in our house (which is definitely not the case). Would highly recommend it to anyone!"
2,Looks better in photos than on counter,"This is a neat product, but be aware that is it mostly photographed from the side, not from the front or back as it will sit on the counter. When viewed from the front or back it is not nearly as attractive, and looks a little lop sided, from the drainage tilt. It is not just the tray that tilts; the whole rack tilts.The rack is solid and good quality. It should last a long time.After a couple of months the utensil holder has fallen apart. I was never happy with the way it looks like it is drunkenly listing on the counter, anyway, so will chalk it up to experience and go shopping again. I have lowered the star rating."
4,zojila dish rack drainer,"I have this dish rack for almost 4.5 years. It was purchased in Oct. 2006.Up sides : Functional & unique/good looking. If you do not have big counter space, this one will not take over your space too much yet it holds quite some stuff including 1 or 2 pots/pans if you arrange them carefully. The way of draining water into the sink is smart.Down sides: 1) Expensive. 2) utensil holder is small; the divider inside (V shape)in the holder prevents easily cleaning. 3) Rust came around the joins/wire and underneath the drain board area after 2+ years of use but overall rust did not spread too much even after another 2 more years of use.Overall I would recommend this product."
4,"Utensil holder, poor design.","If the utensil holder was enclosed all around, I would rate it with 5 stars. I hope more people will express dissatisfaction with the utensil design. Hopefully, Zojila may come up with a newer design ( enclosed utensil holder ). It would be easy to change, as it clips right onto the top of the rack."
3,self draining works,"but the dish rack itself is small, has a large space open on the side (I already lost a precious small glass that fell thru and smashed)and just doesn't hold all that much. It seems to be designed for dishes and glasses but I use bowls, and lids, and pots and all kinds of stuff. I prefer the classic style of drainer.On the other hand, stainless steel is certainly better looking and doesn't grow mold like plastic does and the draining part works quite well as long as I check to be sure it is hanging over the sink first."
2,unbalanced?,"i like the way it looks but have already broken a couple of glasses from ""incorrect placement"", if you don't place the dishes strategically, it tips over and thus things break. That's not very cool and i'm thinking about buying some weights to hold it down. and my stainless steel pan is already gross and spotty from a couple of uses. i need to clean it with some stainless cleaner. either way, i wasn't very impressed with the price and the $10 shipping fee, totaling $60. i'd rather pay $30-40 for the whole package."
4,Zojila 'Rohan' Dish Rack,very sturdy and good construction using quality stainless steel. Also it holds more than standard size with one open side.
4,stainless drainer,its larger then i thought so the end does n;t sit over the sink because i have a filter faucet on the right side of my sink i have to use a dish to collect the excess water
4,Product is great but shipping left something to be desired,"When this arrived, the day before it was to be delivered as a gift, Amazon had shipped it in a box somewhatlarger than the dish, and with only two of those little air pillows included as packing material, allowing the dish to slosh around inside the box. As a result, the lid and dish were smashed to pieces. I contacted Amazon to get a replacement, which did come quickly but too late to deliver on time, and it did arrive undamaged that time but with the same inadequate packing. The dish itself is great, no complaints, the delivery wasn't great"
4,An absolute heartbreaker that should be read by all&#65533;,"What can be said about this heartbreaking book that has not already been said in the tear drenched pages of this true story about a mother who lost two daughters within two years? Sheila, mother of two, was killed by a drunk driver, and then Sherri, mother of three, succumbed to cancer. The description of the terrible events in the hospital are so real, so heartbreaking, it is hard to read, for you can feel the mother's anguish with every word. No praises of literary style, no impartial description of writing talents is possible for this book, for it lives from the heart and soul of the author.It has been said that no parent should ever outlive their children. This tragic story, as sad as it is, should help any of those unfortunate parents who have lived through that kind of hell to overcome their never ending nightmares and unbearable grief."
3,Just alright,I really dont get down with flicks like this but saw it over a friends house and it was alright make sure you check it out.
3,"Some good updates, same old bugs, not enough innovation","Pretty much everything has been said by all the other reviewers. The game is ok, but not innovative, so it comes down to whether or not you should spend [item price] on it. I say, ""No!"" based on my experience w/the game as well as all the negatives pointed out in the reviews that have already been done. This review was not helpful, but also not redundant."
2,Dumb AI,The AI in this game is really dumb and can annoy the heck out of you. Borrow it or rent it. Not worth buying.
4,"Ummm, its good.","I really like this game. Though yes it does have a few kinks with the camera views and what not, you cant quite find that perfect angle like ESPN has. Yet i do love this game. I used Ricky Williams and guided my blocker into someone and then broke for about 20 yards and scored. This game has many ups and a few downs. Its worth the money for that Saturday party with your friends. Overall a good game."
3,WARNING: This is not as good as you think,"First of all, I did play this at media play and all I can say is that this wasn't as good as I thought. First, the graphics, yah, I guess they are pretty good, same as the shadowing. But I think NFL Fever is a little bit better, but I really don't care much about the graphics. Overall:4/5. Second, the gameplay, I guess it is pretty good. good handoffs, good passing, etc. I think it is a little bit better than fever. But Nfl Fever has better controlling than Madden. (I don't know if you can change the controlls on Madden, if you can then this shouldn't be a problem. But I know you can on Fever) Overall 3/5 because i am not sure. Total: 4 + 3 = 7 divide that by 2 is : 3.5I think you should rent it first. If you don't like it, then try Fever"
4,Madden 2004 Review,"Overall this game is pretty good. If you play on the easiest mode, you could win by 50 points. So I would put it on pro level. The graphics are great. The new PLAYMAKER CONTROL is awesome. The downsides are in franchise mode your players will retire when they get old, the sucky teams always make it to the super bowl, and your players will holdout if your too cheap to pay them more money."
1,The worst football game ever!,"This game will stink like the rest of em'.Madden makes the worst football games ever.If you want a fast paced football game go for the 2k series,if you want the best graphics get nfl fever 2004 instead of this.Why do people like the boring games that EA sports dishes out?"
2,Same as 2003 with more gimmicks and hotdog stands,"I'll keep this review fairly short. If you have played Madden 2003 then that is pretty much what 2004 is. 2004 added more gimmicks like playmaker control and owner mode where you can basically set the price of hotdogs and hamburgers in your stadium. This is unimportant to me, I would have liked to have seen EA use the extra spare time they used in adding more gimmicks and improve the obvious cheating ""come-back"" AI. Aside from it being the same game as 2003, the AI is one of the main reasons I have not actually bought this game. If EA fixed their problems first then added gimmicks then I would consider purchasing this game, however they did not. IF EA ever decides to improve their problems like unrealistic CPU AI then maybe I will buy Madden titles again, but as it stands Madden 2003 (and NCAA 2003) will be my last EA title(s)."
3,Good,"It's good but not up to the graphics and gameplay of ESPN. Also if you only have an xbox like me and want play online, again ESPN."
2,"Offense fun, defense cheap","This game is put together great for the most part. Offense is a lot of fun, but when its time to play defense, this game is nothing but frustrating. If the opposing team has any receiver worth anything, expect that receiver to have about 150 receiving yards and at least two touch downs. It is seemingly impossible to keep a decent team from having about 350 passing yards. Guess I will be going back to Fever again this year."
3,Doesn't deserve the hype!!!,"For three years now I have gotten excited when the new Madden came out. In my pre-season excitement I have once again made the mistake of purchasing Madden 2004. Dont get me wrong, the game has excellent features and has a decent feel. But for me, graphics and action count for alot. I appreciate a finely polished game that is pleasing to look at and fun to play. But honestly, this game is not as smooth and is graphically inferior to NFL Fever. Unfortunately, Ron Pitts gets on my nerves but I will suffer through his banter for the sake of solid graphics. Madden is certainly not the ""UNTIMATE"" football game, as many people profess."
3,wheres the defense?,There is no defense in this game. Are you telling me that brian dawkins and Ed Reed can't stop rookie Nate Burleson? They need some srious gameplay changing to do. I found myself wondering if the gameplay is a joke or not. other than that its a good game.
4,Just by a tad it beats all other COMP,"The Madden series or even EA sports barely beats all other comp. The only reason why i pick EA over Sega is EA's character modles seem to move more freely than Sega's. Sega's people seem way too controlled. I am a big fan of the Madden series, its a great line of games, but i wouldnt say it is completely the ultimate champ. If you want a game with realistic game play then roll with Sega, if want some fun and realistic go with madden, if u want totally unrealistic go with NFL Fever. Please not that Fever and Sega have online play, but madden dosent."
5,best football simulator ever!,"I love football. I love madden games. Simply, if you like fottball at all then this game will command all of your attention with it's terrific graphics, new upgraded rosters and jerseys, and the new playmaker control which will revolutionize the gaming world forever by giving games to be nearly as real as possible. Madden, other than his pointless chatter, Can't be beat or loved more."
4,"Good, But not a Huge inprovement over 2003","If you're looking for new game play, this isn?t for you. But it has many games within the game, which add a lot of fun. The game play is basically the same as 2003, which I loved. The new playmaker feature is nice, but over hyped. I like the new owner mode, which allows you to set ticket, food, staff, and parking prices, to generate income.Another new feature is the? Madden Cards?, which you earn points during drill challeges and during the games, to buy packs of cards. The cards include cheats, secret stadiums, player cards and historic teams."
3,The best but could be better,"This is the best football game out there, but could be better. The computer likes to cheat (the most annoying factor), and sometimes it can be difficult to control players."
4,Nice Mount,"This mount was easy to install and sturdy, and I'd gladly buy it again. It allows side-to-side adjustment of about 6"" for my 64"" plasma (more adjustment for smaller screens), but no tilt adjustment - the TV ends up TV is parallel to the wall (good for my installation). It's pretty easy to hang the TV on the mount. The only problem was that the TV mounting screw assortment which came with the mount didn't include short enough M8 screws for my TV - the new thin TV panels only need a 10mm or 12mm long screw and can't handle anything longer. The shortest screw included was 16mm. I guess I could have used the included spacers under the screw heads to ""shorten"" them, but I just trimmed the screws shorter with a cutoff wheel on a dremel (don't bother looking for M8x12mm screws at Home Depot)."
3,60 some Ways to Succeed as an Independent Consultant,"Just as in the book 101 ways to be Romantic, I found some of the sugestions to be absurd and silly. This atleast, is true for me. There are some things I would not do in 101 years. For the most part, I found many good ideas and I have tried a few and found them to be successful. The ideas that I won't try might be the ones that work great for you. Get this book and if you only find a few good ideas or 101, you will be better off than if you had left this book on the shelf."
2,Lame - no 3D,"My children loved this movie in the theater so the minute I saw the double pack I ordered it. I should have read the packaging more closely. Only the BOB short is in 3D, the movie is not. Given that several animated films have already been released in 3D for television - and given that the BOB short is in 3D - why tell us why Dreamworks did you release the ""first animated movie in true 3D"" in glorious 2D. I feel another edition coming out for Christmas but to me this is basically a bait and switch. My children are extremely disappointed."
1,very disappointed,I bought the double pack mainly for the 3d movie.What a mistake itis bad and very short about 15 minutes.
4,Careful !! One of the both movies is not 3D,"The movie is very nice, actually better than i believed, but it is promoted as a regular and 3D version two pack with 3D glasses. The real thing is that ONLY ONE of the both Dvd's is 3D and it's ( Bob's big break ) a short of 10 or 15 minutes!!, the main movie it's not 3D version only regular version and as i just said, the movie it's great but not 3D as at first impression they make you think it is"
5,Excellent,"I found this book to be very good. It flows smoothly throughout and is not riddled with bias. The author did a wonderful job depicting each person. I was truly surprised at how well-written this book was and it was a real ""page-turner"". Ann Rule, watch out--here is an author who can actually give you a run for your money.It is mind-numbing reading about the results of two sociopaths who, through fate, end up hooking up with each other. I truly feel sorry for the two children who suffered because of the actions of the adults around them. I highly recommend this book. You will not want to put it down."
3,Interesting but questionable scholarship,"Linderman has written a very interesting study of soldiers' psychological reactions to the Civil War. He discusses the viewpoints that people had going into the war and how they changed with the experience of combat. Perhaps the best part of the book is his study of Civil War veterans and the post-war reaction. Having said that, though, I found some of Linderman's scholarship problematic. He has a tendency to make broad sweeping statements (""All soldiers thought X...) which worries me. His bibliography is a little short and is slanted, as is some of his analysis, toward Northern contributors. Thus, he has very little to say about whether losing the war was psychologically different from winning it, which one would think would be the case. Overall, this is a useful book but I would read it in conjunction with other works on the subject -- McPherson's studies and *Seeing the Elephant* in particular."
5,Fascinating,"This civil war book is unique, in that we see the war from the perspective of those who were involved. Linderman includes excerpts from letters and diaries of the men who fought this horrible war. The reader gets a true feel for what this period in history must have been like for the men and women who lived through it."
1,Author jumps around and is hard to follow,There has to be a book out there that is better written and easier to follow than this book. I would not recomend it to anyone.
2,"Works, although a tad slow, and doesn't stream mp4","If all you're looking is for a NAS device, this one works fine, but is a little slow (even over a 1Gb connection).I picked this up hoping to use it as a media server for my home network (PS3/Xbox movie/music server). As it turns out, it worked fairly well for my mp3 and mpeg files, but didn't recognize mp4 files as movies, and so I couldn't stream most of my encoded movies.I replaced it with the slightly pricier HP mv2020, and so far am very happy with it."
5,I love these!!!,These are so nice! I do not have them on chairs. I have them side by side on my adirondack bench. I needed a certain size and these fit perfect and I loved the colors. I've had them kinda rained on twice and I've had cigarette ashes dropped on them and then rubbed! So I've removed stains easily with a Tide Stick and the rain just bubbles up on top so doesn't soak into them. They are better than expected and coloring is very nice!!! I get lots of comments that they go with all the colors on my deck.
2,"An okay book, but what was author's vision???","I read this book years ago for a class called ""Women and Public Policy"" at Brown University. The author interviews approximately 25 political feminists and 25 political women opposed to feminism and tries to analyze what makes them tick. The author's introduction shows that she is a progressive and an anti-essentialist feminist. However, her excuse for only interviewing white women still comes off as she just doesn't know enough political women of color or she just isn't prepared to analyze race and gender issues simultaneously. Further, the comments by the antifeminists will make feminists and pro-feminists want to vomit. This was an okay book, I just have concerns about the author's purpose and vision."
2,Still NOT COLD ENOUGH,This unit simply does NOT coolthe drinks enough. I have mine set at the maximum cold setting. The drinks are not as cold as they should be. I saw one reviewer state that this protects us against ourselves. Since we would set it too cold and freeze the drinks? All you would do is NOT set it to the max.I am having them back out again. This will be the third time. If they can't fix it; then they can take it back and sell it to somebody who needs to be PROTECTED AGAINST THEMSELF.
2,NOT COLD ENOUGH,"I bought one of these at Home Depot. It doesn't cool enough. I had a repairman out and he said it was ok. He left a note saying it was ok, since it was cooling between 36-38 degrees.It says it will cool to 34 degrees. It doesn't do what it says it should do. I am having them back out and if they can't fix it, THEN TAKE IT BACK.I don't know about you, but beer has to be colder than 38 degrees."
4,Terrible PR job by Maytag,"Looks like a great product. However, I have been trying to get more information on this thing for 6 weeks. Maytag has done a poor job of releasing details of the product. I am anxious for more information before I deal with 200lbs of product that I might have to return if it is not as expected. I have called, emailed, etc. Maytag, please release more info!"
1,Buyer beware!,"The Skybox is a really terrific product -- in theory only! Look online and you will find an alarming number of posts on do-it-yourself websites from people with the same problem I have. We bought our Skybox in 2004 and it only ran for 3 years before the compressor died. Apparently this is a common issue. Unfortunately, Maytag no longer makes replacement parts for this beast. A local repair person told us that he could ""maybe"" find another compressor that would fit, but it would cost more for parts and labor than it's worth. I phoned Maytag customer service for help or direction. Their stance is that the fridge is out of warranty and therefore no longer their legal responsibility. The only thing they'd do for me is extend an offer of a 15% discount off the purchase of another beverage center. Do yourself a favor and RUN, not walk, away from the Skybox. Get a real refrigerator and save yourself a lot of money and headaches."
1,I expected better from Maytag,"This thing is a p.o.s. I have not had the cooling problems with my unit but the machanical parts have a high hoover factor. The unit is 8 mos old and 2 rows have quit working and 1 row dispenses 2 cans of product. Service is none existant, parts are unavailable and customer satisfaction in unobtainable. I'm disappointed in Maytag for their lack of support, it seems no one at maytag cares. I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT. A new or used refridgerator is money better spent."
1,Sad about Skybox,I purchased a skybox for my husband's birthday including the stand. It worked for a short period of time and now it will not dispense or cool. I spoke to a friend of ours that purchased 3 of them and two out of the three are not working. We were told by a repair tech that it cost more to repair than it is worth. I later found out that Home Depot sold the last of theirs for $99 to get rid of them. And Sears will no longer carry them as well. I am very disgusted with the product.
2,"Jams, no help from Maytag","My Skybox started to jam in the second beverage row about a year after I bought it and the third row jammed a few months later. I purchased it in July 2004. I started calling Maytag in Dec. 2005. I found, after looking into it myself that it solidly freezes the wiring, circuit board and mechanism and takes over 24 hours unplugged and door open to defrost. Maytag says ""Sorry"", the warranty is one year and no exceptions. The local dealer says probable restriction in sealed system and not serviceable. Looks like I got the proverbial shaft. KenUpdated 5/6/2011. Refrigeration completely failed about 2 years ago and machine is useless...not recommended."
4,SKYBOX BY MAYTAG REVIEW,"I JUST RECEIVED MY SKYBOX IN THE MAIL, AND THE MACHINE ITSELF IS GREAT, BUT VERY HEAVY. IF YOU'RE THINKING IT'S THE WEIGHT OF A MINI-FRIDGE...THINK AGAIN!! I RECOMMEND TO PEOPLE TO SAVE THE $69 ON THE STAND, AND PUT IT ON A COUNTER OR TABLE. THE STAND TOOK ME 2 HOURS TO ASSEMBLE, AND TWO OF THE HOLES TO ATTACH THE MACHINE TO THE STAND, DIDN'T LINE UP. THE HOLES WERE DRILLED INCORRECTLY. THE MACHINE ON THE OTHER HAND IS EASY TO USE, AND THE DIRECTIONS FOR LOADING BOTTLES AND CANS ARE VERY USEFUL. I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT HOW TO GET REPLACEMENT CARDS FOR THE BUTTONS. THEY GIVE YOU 18 SODAS AND 2 WATER CHOICES FOR THE CARDS. BUT THE OPERATION OF THE MACHINE, SO FAR IS FINE AND I RECOMMEND IT TO ALL...THE STAND ON THE OTHER HAND, USE THE $69 TO PURCHASE YOUR DRINKS!!"
2,not cold enough,"puchased skybox at sears i month ago. would not cool below 40 degrees. called maytag and they came out 5 days later, fan was installed backwoods. now after 48 hours at max, temperature in top compartment only 38 degrees (this is where cold air comes in) bottom compartment will not go below 44 degrees. am returning to sears for full refund. p.s. there is a rumor this model is discontued and a new model is coming in about 2 months, maytag will not give me any info. on new model. also some stores are discounting it now $399.00 plus $100.00 gift card. Bernies, no. allleboro, MA. this is another indication that it indeed may be discontued. anybody else hear about a new model?"
4,Got my Skybox!,"After waiting since finding out about the product in November it is finally dispensing beer in my home! This is a very neat product. It is bigger than you might envision (width). It is also pretty tall with the optional stand.As noted in another review, the stand is slightly difficult to assemble and attach to the Skybox. It takes longer than you would think (about 90 minutes) to unpack and assemble. It will go much easier if you download the current instructions from the Skybox web site. The instructions in the box are not correct and are still not accruate even with the addendums. Definitely download the current instructions from the web.I am very disappointed that the panels are backordered for several weeks. This is a mistake by Maytag. They have known the product launch date for months."
2,Very Displeased,"I purchased my SkyBox in Alaska in June 2004. It was shipped to my overseas home and then back to the states in June 2005. It has never worked very well, from either cooling drinks or dispensing them. The drinks (both bottles and cans) hang up in the dispenser. Additionally, I have had a continual problem where one drink will dispense, and then I have to open the door and close it to ""reset"" the ability for the next to come out. I will dispense a drink and the four red LED's will blink continually on the face until I open and close the door.The thing looks good in a bar room, but other than that, it was a waste of money. The one that Maytag sold that had the lit up face with the sports inserts and was a basic refrigerator would have been a better purchase.I'll stick it in my garage next to my Commodore 64 as an artifact of what seemed like a cool purchase and ended up being just something that was neat to own at the time."
2,Disappointed with Service,"The price is not too bad, the size is a plus. The bottom stand is difficult to assemble. It keeps things nice and cold. I needed service 3 weeks after i got it, between service calls, ordering parts and everything 10 months went by, finally I demanded a new unit. It came the day my warranty was up. The replacement unit does not function well either, so here we go again Thank goodness I did take out the 3 year extended warranty, please make sure you have that if you get a skybox, you will need it."
1,Are you kidding me,No Texas A&M option? Largest alumni in the WORLD and no option to purchase? ........yet they have TCU .........ok
5,Everything I expected it to be,I received my Skybox on 8/31. The stand was simple to put together. It keeps the drinks ICE cold. I have had no problems with jamming. It is working perfectly so far. A Great addition to our rec room. I highly recommend.
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I hesitated buying this due to the negative reviews. I found this on Amazon for $325 (shipping included) and thought, ""What a deal!"" I ordered it, and had it the same week! Set up was a breeze, the box base went together smoothly, and I had it all done, set, and loaded within an hour! Cold (yes, plenty cold) drinks followed within 2 hours! Either Maytag got their stuff together and fixed the concerns, or I got lucky - either way, I highly recommend this for the ultimate home bar or garage!"
5,Abes,"Sounds like you have a 50/50 shot on getting a good skybox vending machine based on reviews. I purchased a used one and I am actually extremely happy with how cold it is getting. After setting it up I turned the temp regulator all the way to the right to ""max"" and that is all it took. The cans are coming out just above freezing and this unit is getting colder than my regular fridge which is digitally set at 40 degrees. How cold it is getting my beer is all I care about so good addition to the man cave and ***** review.Lastly to all the people going crazy looking for certain panels to put on the machine just go to a decent printer and they can mount any image you want to a translucent board and your done."
1,Expensive! Horrible! Threw my money away!,"Spent $500 on a drink machine 2 years ago that has quit cooling, has 2 out of 4 buttons that don't work/dispense drinks and was told by the serviceman today (after I paid a $65 diagnostic fee) that it is UNREPAIRABLE! They can't repair it on site or at their service department because the ""broken part"" is fully encased and since Maytag doesn't make this product anymore, you can't buy replacement parts. Wow, I'm so glad I had $500+ to flush down the toilet. The lock broke w/in a couple of months, but I could live with that. We didn't abuse this skybox, it stayed in our bonus room and my 2 older kids (16 & 19) would go up there just to get drinks, then head outside or to their rooms. This is my first and last Maytag product! Don't buy this product, new or used! You'll be stuck w/ a big appliance that you'll need to pay more money for to take to a landfill. MAYTAG SUCKS!!!!!"
3,Fixed Machine,"I had my Skybox for about a year before it stopped getting cold anymore. I was told by many appliances places that they would not touch the Skybox. I was told it is of poor design (internally). I found a guy that does commercial refrigeration and he said he could fix it. The problem with mine was the compressor went out. The sides of my Skybox would get pretty hot. The heat, I am told, burned out the compressor. I was told these compressors are a common compressor used in quite a few different machines. They are easy to get. The guy replaced the compressor and added two more fans. One in the top tray and one in the bottom tray to move the air better and stop the heat build up. It cost me $160. to get this done. I bought the Skybox for a low price when they were being discontinued so I think I'm still ahead of the game. If you have no cooling, check around. There is someone out there that should be able to fix it."
5,excellent!,"I have read several books and watched several video/DVD's on baseball instruction for Little Leaguers. So far, this is my favorite. Don't let the title fool you, this book isn't just about fixing specific problems, in the process it teaches the proper methods from start to finish, whether it be hitting, throwing/catching, pitching or fielding. Other books, DVD's, videos etc., teach proper methods, but they don't teach you how to recognize problems. This book does. This book points them out for you, like recognizing a tired pitcher. No Little League pitcher will tell the coach he's tired and needs to come out of the game, after reading this book, the coach will know. I compare all other books to this one. I constantly refer to this book for a reference."
2,Only for novices,"If you are a baseball novice, or if you never played ball above the Little League level, this book may be of value to you as a coach. Otherwise, there is little here that will strike an experienced coach or player as new or insightful.In general, I've found that the books published by Little League Baseball for coaches aren't very helpful. In fact, the only book I've found on the subject that contains useful, practical advice is ""Bean's About Baseball."""
1,"NO SPANISH AUDIO, NO SUB IN SPANISH TOO","When i see the fifth season of touched by an angel I was very happy!! this morning i running fry's for buy this serie and and my happiness became sadness when I saw the english audio and subtitles in English! i don't undestand WHY????? i hope long years for this season ! CBS has the sounds in Spanish, because the added? or Spanish subtitles, this is the reason why there is so much piracy in Latin America require us to record from the tv and then add the audio in Spanish! Now i need buying pirated! or record the tv is an insult to the Latino fans of the series!"
5,Love this!,"I was so excited to receive this in the mail. I've waited patiently for this since I purchased the first four seasons. I will wait patiently for seasons 6-9, hopefully I dont't have to wait too long. I love the messages each episode brings and it always reminds me to have hope in humanity and never to stop believing in Him who watches over each us."
5,Wonderful Book,"I was drawn to this book which extensively deals with life on the Aland Islands, which is where my Father was born. The author is an excellent writer and draws you into the story. The characters are so real, and I have found myself thinking of them even when not reading the book. Events that happen in this woman's life are so realistic I'm sure the author must have drawn on someone's real life experiences, but even so, she skillfully writes of these people, places and events. A must read."
5,so easy to use,This has to be the easiest and fastest cooking method ever. I use it for most everything. the meatloaf is great. You do have to replace the gaskets about every 2 yrs. You can make a roast in 20 min and its great.
2,Didn't fit!,"I have to rate this purchase very low because this lid is advertised to fit ""all Fagor pressure cookers"" but it doesn't fit the 10 quart that I have. Disappointed when I got it? Yes!!It appears to be a good quality lid, and it fits my father's 4 quart cooker just fine (the only reason I'm not giving a rating of 1 star), but I feel I've been deceived."
3,Doesn't fit,"This lid didn't fit even though I measured my pan multiple times to make sure. It is not the dimensions it states. It is not wide enough and off by about 1/2 "". Just enough to make it unusable."
3,Size matters,"This lid was excellent for the 2.5qt pressure skillet, but not for the 10qt pressure cooker I purchased. As it turned out, I had 2.5qt. That's why the rating's higher."
1,Does not fit all,"The first description clearly states ""Fits all Fagor pressure cookers"", however this is an 9"" lid and will not fit at least half of the Fagor models, beware. Check out Fagor's website and their accessories section, which clearly outlines the part # for each lid and when a 9"" and when a 10"" lid is required."
5,Great Lid,"I love this lid for my small pressure cooker. When I have pepared my pressure cooked foods, I replace the pressure lid with the glass lid to keep things warm or continue the cooking process after adding items which are to be added after pressure is released. When you want to use the pan but not cook under pressure you have a perfect lid. The glass lid makes it possible to see inside to determine whether you want to lower or increase the heat without having to lift a lid to see inside."
3,"As seen on ""Mulholland Drive""","This book appears in one scene of David Lynch's movie ""Mulholland Drive"" (2001)"
5,Great book for toddlers.,Having the CD read-along makes it a wonderful combination. A must-have book for the toddler collection. Just right in length.
5,Like my Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver,It works perfectly. The battery lasts a long time. Haven't had to recharge it yet. I expect this one to last as many years as my last Remington shaver which was beginning to need recharging every few days.
4,Love the Remington MS2-390 shaver.,This was to replace an old Remington MS2-390 Microscreen shaver I had. I wouldn't settle for anything less than a Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable shaver to shave my legs. A woman's shaver just doesn't get close enough.
1,Extemely Poor Workmanship & Durability,"I bought a Remington MS2-390 about 2 years ago, and although I have owned Remington shavers in the past and been satisfied with their performance and value, this shaver has terrible workmanship and durability. For starters, the rubber covering on the on/off button wore away about a year ago, and now the soft rubber covering (blue colored in image) is starting to peel back. There is also a thin dark blue coating on the blue rubber grip that keeps flaking off, so I have to look in the mirror after shaving each morning to make sure I don't have a blue flake or two on my shirt or face. Unfortunately, all these things happened after the warranty ran out, so now I have a 2 year old shaver that looks like it is 10 years old. It's not clear how much longer it will work."
3,Remington Shaver,"I've only used the shaver a few times, so perhaps it hasn't been ""broken in"" yet, but the results so far are pretty mixed. It's rather uneven in effectiveness."
5,Great Value for the Money,"This is a replacement for my husband's first Remington razor, which was a TC300. He has been a blade shaver most of his life, and didn't think an electric razor could deal with his tough wiskers. The Remingtons have proven him wrong. This is a great basic razor and an excellent value for the money. I am a Consumer Reports reader, and they recently rated this razor as a CR Best Buy. We have to agree."
3,Not so great.,"Very difficult to get a good close shave. Shaver head is not comfortable as it shaves -- seems to be like trying to put a square peg into a round hole -- it doesn't want to follow the contours of the face. Also, the power switch is very difficult to push. You have to push your finger fairly hard and deep into the recessed hole to activate/deactivate the switch. Motor does seem to be pretty powerful. Have not had it long enough to really evaluate the staying power of the battery charge."
2,Remington micro screen Electric shaver,This product shaves well on open surfaces but the shaving foils are too long to get round many curved areas of my face. The trimmer is very poor. I returned the product
1,Torture,"While this shaver does do a nice quick shave, the price is too high. This is far and away the loudest shaver I've ever heard, and shaving near my ears is a horrible experience because it's so painfully loud. Near the end of my use, I'd put one finger in my ear to block the noise. I realized just how silly that was and went back to my old stand-by panasonic (10 years old!).I wouldn't be surprised if this were loud enough to cause hearing loss.In addition, cleaning the shaver is a bit difficult because of the shoddy construction. The razors fall off their supports with the slightest jiggling, so I had to hold them in one hand, getting hair dust all over.Overall, this is one of the sorriest pieces of equipment I've bought."
2,shaver review,"I bought this shaver based on Consumer Reports' rating and it did not live up to their rating. I've used a Braun 1775 for several years and the Remington did not shave any closer and was extremely noisy. In fact, it is the loudest shaver I've ever owned. In addition, the trimmer is more difficult to use than on any other shaver I've owned. I decided to keep using the Braun and gave the Remington to my son."
2,Consumer Report made a mistake,"Totally inadequate as far as I am concerned. I am a long time Norelco user and needed a new razor. Saw the Consumer Report on the Remington and decided to buy it. It simply did not cut well, made too much noise and pinched some."
3,Good razor except when growth is long,The razor generally worked very well with close shaves fairly quickly; EXCEPT when I didn't shave for a few days; it seemed to have trouble with cutting a few stray hairs that were longer than usual; bottom line I returned it
2,remington razor,"with this particular razor, i had to shave twice a day for it to be effective. otherwise, it would pull thewiskers instead of cutting them. for me, it was painfull to use.if you are a person that likes to shave once or every other day, i would suggest a rotary. they may not shave quite as close but seem to do better with longer wiskers. of course, it is relative to how much you want to spend.by the way, CONSUMER REPORT recommended this remington foil as a best buy. maybe i purchased a lemon becausei've had very good luck with CONSUMER REPORT recommendations.good luck."
2,Not good,"It doesnt seem to shave that well. It is also VERY noisy. I had other remington blades that were 3 headed circular, that worked great so I figured I would spend a few more dollars and get this one. Mistake!"
1,Didn't last long,"I had the razor about five months, and alternated using it with a safety razor. I left it plugged in to recharge all the time, but now it will only give me 45 seconds of power before the battery fails!"
4,good shave,"This Remington microscreen gives a good shave, I find it to be noisy and a little awkward to handle. It holds a charge for about 60 minutes and gives adequate red light warning before it stops. The one hour recharge is standard for the industry. Because I was used to a rotary shaver, it took me awhile to get used to the broad head of the Remington, but it now works fine. The on/off button could be more responsive. I find that I usually have to press it a couple of times to get it to respond. Overall, It's a good shaver and I would probably buy it again."
2,so loud it will hurt your ears; avoid,"This razor is the loudest thing I've ever put semi-voluntarily near my ears. We laugh out loud every time I turn it on. My old Norelco needed to be replaced, but this is ridiculous. I bought this because I am a sheep who takes orders from Consumer Reports, but I guess they don't track noise. It shaves the same as my old Norelco, but is about 10 times louder.Giving it two stars since it does cut the hairs off my chin as promised. By Heavens, just buy a different brand that is quieter. I'd send it back if I had the energy, but I'll probably keep it and hope it breaks or something so I can try again."
5,Shaves close and quickly,"I bought this because Consumer Reports said it gave a very close shave; most of my shavers always left more bristle than I wanted. And they took too long. This I found truly fast, truly easy to clean, and it gives a genuinely close shave. I know that most electric shavers aren't nearly as good after a year or so as when they are new, and I've only had this a short time. But I do love it, at least for now."
4,Excellent shave for the price,"Overall, this is a very good shaver, however it is a little loud and seems to miss a few hairs here and there. Still, for the price, it is hard to beat. As long as it is kept clean and charged, you will be happy with the end result."
3,Remington MS2 390 Microscreen 599 Shaver,"After a zillion years shaving my light beard with a rotary type, I thought I would try a screen shaver. I purchased the Remington MS2-390 Miroscreen model. The price is right, it is well designed and cleaning is convienient. As far as effectiveness in my case, it is certainly does the job but runs a close second to the rotery. All in all, it appears like a good choice if you are looking for a screen model."
3,close shave but not perfect shaver,I purchased this item b/c of a recommendation from Consumer Reports. As they say it does offer a very close shave perhaps even exceptionally close for an electric razor (5/5). Having said this it does have few limitations. It is difficult to shave the neck with this unit (2/5); it has difficulty getting slightly longer hairs such as if you failed to shave over the weekend (1/5); the on/off switch is a bit clumsy to use (4/5); the sideburn clippers seem poorly designed and are clumsy to extent (2/5); but battery life is good (5/5). Overall the unit performs well but is not as easy and quick to use as my previous Remington triple head rotary. Overall score 19/30
5,Excellent shaver,"This is the first item I have bought online and I was thrilled with the fast delivery, it came exactly when they said it would. The shaver is great, easy to use and a very close shave, excellent."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This is a basic shaver. If price is your criteria, then its probably a decent buy. It's noisy, and it has only two cutting heads. But it will give you a decent shave, eventually. It doesn't appear to be made to last a long time. Personally, I would recommend spending a few dollars more and get a Norelco rotary shaver."
2,"Inadequate, especially for neck","Bought this shaver after reading reviews here of a closer shave than any other shaver. I agree - the shave was extremely close on my face. I was pleased with that.The problem? It was inadequate for the neck. The trimmer was below average as well. I suffered numerous cuts before finally giving up after 3 weeks.Sidenote: This razor can also be extremely slow if you haven't shaved for a couple days. Manageable, but sometimes irritating if in a rush. It took like 3 times as long as my old rotary.Overall I was very disappointed by this razor's performance, mainly bc of the problems it had with my neck."
1,Poor choice for an electric shaver,"This shaver takes many, many passes to do the job. Even then, it's not a close shave. Take a pass on this one."
1,electric shaver,"I was very disappointed with my first purchase from Amazon. The Remington shaver that I received was defective and since you don't accept items that have been opened, I has to resort to sending the shaver to Remington for a replacement which they did, it wasn't an exact replacement but I satisfied with it.I will defintely think twice about ordering a product from Amazon again.Ron Graef at ronaldlg@att.net8-23-10"
2,Corded Shaver for Women,"I purchased this to try on myself. I thought having something I didn't have to use in the shower would be nice. It didn't get the shave I thought I would. I read the reviews and they said it should work just fine for women. It does work fine but most women want a real close shave, everywhere. Disappointed."
3,Good for first time user.,This was my first electic shaver. It took a little getting use to but I like it now. Handle could be smaller for my hand but I got use to it.
4,So far so good,"I've been using this razor for a few weeks now and I have been pleased with it. I don't grow much hair on my face, and the ones that do grow tend to be long and sporadic. There is a built in trimmer that has blades on both sides, which can optionally extend to the height of the screens to cut the long hairs at the same time as the stubble. This feature works really well for me, and negates the need to go hunting for the inevitable remaining longer hairs. The razor doesn't irritate my skin, and it doesn't pull any hairs. Another feature that I like is a red light will come on when the battery is getting low to let you know it needs to be charged."
3,Good budget value,"Works well, seems solidly constructed and reasonable price. The shave is not particularly close, but it is painless even after several days of growth. Easy to clean and holds a charge for a long time."
1,terrible,"I bought this razor after reading about it on consumer reports and the reviews on amazon. I have to guess that CR tested it for a day or so, and the positive reviewers here wrote their reviews after a week or less. The ""microscreen"" is incredibly flimsy. Within 3 weeks, mine developed a slit that grew a little every day. The blades underneath contact your skin through the slit, and hack you up like Freddy Krueger. Then you need to replace the microscreens at $20 each. It's a good razor while the screen lasts, but if you need to replace it every month at $20/each, why bother?"
3,Good,"I charged it up 2 months ago , still running. and it sounds like a weed-eater. hasn't pulled hair yet"
1,Review,"This product is not as described and the shaving blades do not cut as indicated. I was very disappointed after reading such high reviews of product from leading Consumer's magazine. It only does the job if you have smaller hair to cut and anything more than a few days growth, it will catch on your face or not cut at all. I would like to return product if I knew how much to get back after 90 days.Very highly recommended product to only be very highly disappointed!"
2,Remington MS 390,I have owned 2 MS290 Remington razors and loved them both. This new model is so loud you can't shave close to your ears. The trim blade locking mechanism would not keep the blade locked down.
1,"Too much noise, too little shaving","My dad always had a shaver like this. He's dead now. I think he died of the noise. Terrible razor. Way too loud. Never did shave well, even after giving it the time suggested."
3,Remington MS2-390,A close shave but at a cost. The foil screens easily chip (partial holes in the screen) creating an unusable product. The electic blades do a number on your unprotected face through those small gaps in the broken screen. I have had to replace my foil screens three times in the past year alone. The screens also come in pairs and I have found it difficult to remove and replace each foil screen in this specific model. I wish I had kept my old Remington shaver...one solid foil screen and cutter blade.
3,remington MS2-390,"shaves well--bigest problem with mounting of the cutters, they come off too easily when foil is removed to clean."
2,I just don't like it,"I bought this shaver to replace a very old Norelco after seeing so many good reviews and a recommendation from [...]. Unfortunately, I just don't like the shave I get from this razor. If you shave every day, it will probably do just fine. If you're like me, however, and shave every 2-3 days it may give you trouble. It seems to just miss a noticeable amount of whiskers (I'd say something like 10%). No amount of going over these hairs will get them and I end up rubbing my face raw. Maybe it's just the way my face is shaped (pretty angular) or the way my hair grows but I can't get it to work for me. I've since switched to a regular razor with much more comfortable shaves in less time and better results. It's too bad I thought I just needed to get used to it for more than the return time or I'd send it back."
1,Razor doesn't shave,"The MS2-390 is not anything I would recommend. I've used an electric razor for over fifteen years, after twenty plus years of a straight razor, and this is the worst shave I've ever had. It was loud, did not cut clean and left a five o'clock shadow at seven in the morning. Don't waste your money. Spend a few dollars more and upgrade."
4,Very Good Razor,"I have owned my MS2-390 for over 4 years. It has been a very good razor. It shaves very close and is comfortable. Following the instructions of allowing the battery to completely discharge every few months, the battery life has been amazing. For the first couple of years I could go nearly 3 weeks between charges. Now I get about a week and a half. I have had only two issues with the product. First, although it shaves very close, it will not get long hairs and allows a few whiskers, especially on the neck, to go untouched. This requires using the edger occasionally to cut these areas. Secondly, the head will become loose easily. I check to make sure the head is firmly in place before each shave. If I don't, I will start the razor and nick the thin foil on the head. I have replaced the head twice since I have owned the razor. I have enjoyed the razor but would like to find one that shaves as close but also gets the longer whiskers."
1,Unhappy customer - Remington MS2-390,"Watch out. Really poor product quality. Gave the Remington MS2-390 to my Father as a Christmas gift. It is now totally dead. I don't live in the same city as my folks, but apparently the battery doesn't hold ANY charge. That's 3 months. So, I can't give Remington any stars for the product or product quality. Also give Amazon low marks because this is outside of their return policy (bought it a month before Christmas and they provide a 60 day return window). Don't waste your money on this item."
2,Second screen failure in 5 months,"This was a very highly rated shaver in a consumer rating magazine. And it does a reasonable job of shaving; not great, as I find that every few days I have to go over my face with a blade razor to catch the odd missed hairs. But that's not so uncommon for electric shavers. However, the screen is very delicate. After a couple of months it broke and I had to replace it. Since then I have religiously used the plastic protective cover when the shaver is not in use, but this morning I discovered (painfully!) that the screen was broken again. I'm giving up on it; replacing screens every few months is too expensive."
4,"It works fine, but treat it gingerly","The shaver works perfectly fine. No, it doesn't shave you as close as a razor would, but if you have to shave every day without irritation, this certainly does a more than acceptable job. You'll just have a slightly thicker 5:00 shadow at around -- say, 5:00. My only complaint is that the cutters easily pop out of their slots when you're brushing them. I ruined one of them when it popped out and fell down the drain (I fished it out with a butter knife -- not a great idea). The solution is to simply grip each cutter firmly but gently between the thumb and forefinger while brushing the hair out of it, and then everything's fine.Basically, this is a great shaver for the price, and I am quite satisfied."
2,No where near a razor,I bought this because of a Consumer Report review but I have to say that the shave is no where close to a razor
1,"Poor performance, requires many passes","I bought this when shaver in a hurry when I needed one (lost the charger to the old one) and simply suffered through it until now:Pros:- Cheap, but not cheap enoughCons:- Extremely POOR performance- Requires many passes through the same area, and will STILL miss some hairs- NoisyWill be staying away from Remington as a brand."
4,Good Razor,"This is my first microscreen razor. It does a better job on my neck than my previous rotary razor. I still use a blade a couple times a week, but will use this one for about 3 days and then get a really good close shave with a blade. I don't care what anybody says, I've never had anything cut as close as a blade. The charge seems to last a long time, and it's nice that you can use it with the cord if the battery dies. It is a little loud, as other reviewers have noted, but its not unbearable. Overall, this seems to be a good electric shaver that gives a decent shave. I bought it because it was recommended by Consumer Reports and offered a good price compared to other electrics. I recommend it."
2,not as promised,"I ordered this shaver because of the 'consumer report' I had read on it. It's almost impossible to get a real close shave because it skips over some hair and no matter how many times you go over it, those same hairs remain."
4,Shaving Results,The shaver is convenient to use. It is very easy to clean. Holds a charge for an extended time.Doesn't work well being used on top of bald head because of rigid structure. In that regard the flexibility of rotary razors gives better results.
4,Close Shave with Adjustment Time,I've now shaved 3 times with this. The first two times were pretty horrible and brought back some bad skin issues. But that all healed in a day or two and now that my face has begun to adjust I'm amazed. The shave is almost if not equal to a straight razor. I'm optimistic that the shave will get even better. It is very loud but makes short work of shaving. However it does miss occasional hairs but they're unnoticeable and can quickly be remedied with the trimmer.
3,I Returned It,"The item was purchased based on Consumers' Reports, which gave this shaver a high rating (""Best Buy""). The shaver was very loud and took a fair amount of time to get a close shave. It left long beard hairs untouched and they needed to be cut with the trimmer. I developed some razor nicks just like a regular blade and still needed to use styptic pencil. I have not had the same problem with three-headed rotary cutters and will go back to that style. The shaver was returned under the 30 day trial policy."
4,It does the job,"Haven't owned an electric razor in many years, so no recent comparisons possible. However, as a good, basic electric razor it gets the job done. If I go more than a day it doesn't get all the hairs on my lower neck as they begin to lay flat. The popup trimmer takes care of most of them. I don't have any complaints about the noise level - hey, it's an electric razor, what do you expect?! It holds a charge for a good long time. Would definitely recommend; at this price it'san excellent value."
2,Give me back my Norelco!!!,"I bought this shaver when my Norelco needed new blades, and I read that it was rated a ""Best Buy"" by Consumer Reports.Although I do like the shape and design of the razor, I don't like much else about it. It doesn't shave very well, and it is very loud as well. It sounds like hair clippers. If I bought this product from the store I would have exchanged it for a different brand."
1,Worst Razor I have ever used!!,"I purchased this razor having never used any electric razor other than a Norelco product. I wanted to try another brand and this particular razor was highly recommended by Consumers Report and this site (customer reviews). I only used it for about 3 or 4 days before i had to give up on it. It did not give a close shave at all. I could shave and rub my hands across my face and still feel stuble. the real reason i stopped using it though was because it would catch my skin at certain times and pinch. That would happen several times per shave in different places on my face or neck. it would just like grab the skin and that was not a good feeling. i did not think to return the razor to remington as they had a ""guaranteed satisfaction"" in place - just forgot about it. I still have it, but will never use it again. Note; I have never had a 'skin bite' by any of the many Norelco shavers i have used over the years."
2,Failed razor,Did not come up to what I expected in this razor. Could not get the hair cutting bar to retract when using. Razor pulled at whiskers now and then and this smarts. Would not recommned this razor.
4,Still a good shave,"Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's ShaverHave had this product for a few years now and it still performs very well. A comfortable, clean shave without nicks and burning sensation. Quality product for the price. Would buy this again."
4,Pleased,"Nice razor. Replaced a similar model whose battery had weakened so much I couldn't get a full shave in on a charge. This shaver uses the same screens but performs much better. Its motor, while a bit loud, performs very well and I like the ability to rinse clean. The first one I received was broken (beard trimmer wouldn't stay retracted) but was very quickly and easily replaced and I am happy with my purchase."
2,One day only,If you have a two day beard -- long hairs -- this razor will not be what you arelooking for. I have an old Rem. (20+ years) that works better.
4,Good Shaver for an Electric,For an electric shaver it does a good job. Not up to a blade but still good. I especially like the fact that you can clean the heads by rinsing them under the faucet.
3,Mixed Review,"I am a first-time user of an electric shaver so I don't have experience on electric-shaver performance. I have found this shaver easy to use and easy to clean. It works really well on short stubble; however, on a beard of any length at all, it's not so great. The shaver catches and pulls hairs, sometimes misses a patch of hair, and once I cut myself with it."
1,Did not like at all. Returned it for a refund.,This was top rated by Consumer Reports but it cut and pinched my skin so bad I bled every time I used it. I have been using electric razors for many years but always a rotary type. Thought I would try this foil kind but returned it after a week per its guarantee.
1,remington MS2-390 electric shaver,"I purchased this electric razor to replace my rotary of 15 years. I have found it to be noisy and pinchy. It holds a charge well for at least a week, which is good. However, it does not shave much better than my old rotary for which I have never replaced the blades.After trying this razor for 2 weeks, I will go back to a rotary, because it shaves at least as well with much more comfort and no pinchy feeling. A real disappointment.Aurora, OH"
4,Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver,"I purchased this shaver because of its top rating in 'Consumer Reports.' The shaver works very well. There are two minor drawbacks. First, it occasionally misses a hair or two on my beard. The wild whisker continues to grow until cut by the pop-up trimmer. The trimmer has two settings that easily cuts these stray beard growths, but this is an extra step that was not required by my older Norelco or Remington Shavers. The second problem occurs when cleaning the cutters underneath the head assembly. The cutters are not firmly attached to the shaver. In my opinion, this is clearly a design flaw. The cutters pop off quite easily when I simply brush the cutters clean. This was not a problem with my older Remington (TA-3070) shaver, and is the bigger of the two irritations."
4,Mostly Good,"It does a good job right off the bat. For some reason it does miss certain hairs every time. However, after three weeks I would say that it is much better, quicker and easier than a blade. It is the only electric shaver I have used so I cannot compare it to other electrics."
1,Just don't like Remington Razors Sorry,"Purchased a Remington, hated it, went back to a Norelco, LOVE IT..., Item was delivered fast, no hassel return, cannot go wrong with Norelco in my opinion"
3,Not quite as expected.,Does not shave as close as expected. Battery life is pretty good so far. It will never beat a wet shave with a razor and foam but no electric ever will. If you are in a hurry and cannot do a wet shave this will do just fine.
1,The worst electric shaver made,After reading some initial good reviews I decided to ask for this razor for Xmas. I had thrown out an old Norelco that I had for over 20 years. How I wish I could go back through the garbage to fish it out. I let my beard grow for 2 days to give it a try. I shaved and shaved with it and hairs were simply not coming off my face compared to my old floating heads and as other reviews have mentioned you can not simply get any hairs off your neck at all. I stood and marveled at how I could shave for 15 minutes with an electric razor and look like I really needed a shave. When you read reviews on anything you will find rave reviews and really bad reviews on anything. Take this review to the bank. DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR! I would think that anyone who is shaving a beard with this piece of crap would be shocked to see the results. Technology has made great advancements since I started using an electric razor in 1959. This Remington razor was not part of any of it.
4,My new ms2-390,I purchased this shaver after looking at Consumer Reports. I wanted a reasonbly priced one that would do a good job. This proved to be the one
2,Lousy shaves,This razor does not produce close shaves as an expensive razor should. I have used it too many times or I would return it
3,Remington razor,I purchased this Remington razor because I needed to replace a Braun one (the second one I've owned) and Consumers Report recommended this Remington. This is the first time that I have been dissatisfied with a Consumers Report chose! The new razor does not give me as good a shaves as the old Braun even though it needed a new head and blades. I will go back to Braun!
1,very poor shaver,"I bought this razor on consumer report recommendation, now i really doubt consumer reports. this foil razor cannot cut a one day growth at all. it is a very time consuming razor,its only plus is the trimmer, which i have to use first to cut close enough to shave, and i do not have heavy whiskers. I am staying with my old remmington titanium r 846 9 years old never changed the blades and still shaves my entire face in a minute or two with out effort. i wont be foiled again."
3,Middle of the road performance,"I have owned several Remington Shavers for many years. I found this one to be OK, but not spectacular. The titanium foil on the heads gives it a closer and slightly more comfortable shave than the stainless steel foil on previous models. Where it falls short is in the overall quality of the shaver. It just doesn't feel as substantial as some of the earlier models I have owned, and still own. The pop up trimmer, at least the one on my shaver pops up very very slowly. ""Pop up"" is a little optimistic, I would characterize it more properly as ""saunters up at a casual pace"". While this is no big deal, I think it reflects that this model was just not made up to the highest standards of Remingtons that I have owned in the past.Overall, not a bad shaver for the price. I am keeping mine, but I would have liked it to be a better quality product. If you have a few more bucks to spend, you might consider one of the slightly higher priced models."
5,This is an excellent shaver,"After trying a Panasonic shaver, and not liking the closeness of the shave, I returned it to Amazon (They are great for making returns easy) and immediately ordered this Remington. I'd been a Remington user before, and this one didn't let me down. It shaves close as a blade for most parts of my face. And I like the fact that it can be cleaned with water. Remington's microscreen seems to work best on my face."
3,Remington MS2-390 shaver,"Not as good as my previous Remington. very noisy, 2 foils instead of three, did not shave as close. Returned for credit and purchased a Remington 3 foil shaver with tilting head. Best Remington yet!"
5,better than you would think,"I had been using one of those four blade razors. When I received my new rechargeable Remington razor I was greatly surprised how much better than the four blade system, as well as my previous electrical shaver, my new Remington Rechargable was."
2,A Disappointment,"The Remington MS3-2000 has been my favorite razor for years. I have owned 2 of these, and refitted them with new cutters and screens for years, which restores it's performance to almost like new. Unfortunately, when the batteries get old and no longer hold a decent charge, your only option is to buy a new razor since the batteries cannot be replaced. It was a crushing blow to find out the MS3-2000 was no longer manufactured. So I bought this MS2-390 because it looked (on paper) like a suitable replacement. Wrong! Cannot get the same close shave, hairs get pulled, the pop-up does not cut as well, and the red light (low charge) comes on every 3 days despite following the charging instructions exactly. It's very disappointing for a leading razor manufacturer like Remington to drop a great product and peddle this poor imitation of a quality razor. I cannot recommend it."
1,Bad buy,"I got this razor last Christmas. I have already had to replace the cutters and comb. Now the rubber covering the switch is peeling off. (So much for water cleaning.) It shaves nicely on the absolutely flat portions of my face but is almost useless on pimples, curves and my neck. My advice ""Do NOT buy""."
5,Excellent electric razor,"Bought this for my wife to use on her legs. It works fast and does good job. She loves it. Easy to clean. Holds a charge. Not to loud for what she uses it for. Tried it on my face, did the best ever for electric razor, however I prefer blade. Little to loud next to your ears, could just use ear plug. The razor is well worth the money. Happy with product."
2,Yanks at whiskers,"Despite allowing for the suggested break-in period (so his beard could get used to the new shaver), this shaver continues to pull whiskers without removing them. The problem is especially bad around the lips. The manufacturer is offering to exchange the shaver."
2,Not as good as old Remington,I've used this razor for about three weeks and one of the cutter blades has fallen off twice while cleaning it. Razor has required charging more frequently than advertised. It does give a good shave and the trimmer is excellent.
1,Disappointed,I had a Norelco Shaver before it died it was avery good shaver. It had 3 rotory heads. This remington is the worsed shaver I have ever used I have to go over and over my face to get all the hairs it just will not pick up and cut the hairs. The trimmer works ok.DissapointedJoseph Harris
2,Dissapointed in San Felipe TX,"I am a long time Norelco user, and I thought I would try another type of electric razor to see what the other technology offered. The Remington MS2-390 had a reasonable rating I thought. After a couple of weeks, I 'settled in' with the razor as the instructions suggested. I ordered it on Arpil 27, and it arrived in a timely manner. On June 1 the razor failed to hold a charge. Moreover, it would not work when plugged into the 120v outlet. I am in the process now of finding a service center to which I can send it for service."
1,Piece of junk!,"Like many other people, I bought this razor based on Consumer Reports' favorable product review.I bought this razor three months ago. The battery in it now won't hold a charge more than a few hours after recharging. I think it's been charged a total of ten times since it was purchased.If other people who bought this item are enjoying it, then I'm happy for them. Mine is a piece of junk."
2,hard to use,Both my husband and son found this shaver hard to use. The blades seem to not cut well. My husband had to travel over the same area on his face to get the stubble off. Also it is loud.
2,Mr. G.Gustafson,"Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's ShaverThis shaver does a good job on a flat surface,like the cheeks,butit really comes up short on the neck and under your chin. If missed hairsgrow longer (on your neck or under your chin) their extra length curls up and makes it almost immpossibe to cut."
3,Not as good as touted,I use my electric shaver for touch-up or a weekend shave when I don't want to go through the hassle of shaving with a razor. I found the Remington to be a bit of a disappointment as it did not shave as close as the 20 year old Braun that it replaced and occasionally pulled at my beard.
3,remington rechargeable shaver,"It's just average in terms of the closeness of the shave, a little harder to clean than some because the shaving heads tend to fall out when brushing out the shavings, and it's extremely noisy during use. Still, for the price, it's a good deal."
2,Dosn't do the job,This shaver was highly rated so I purchased it. It did not remove the wiskers from my neck. Very dissappointed
2,I sent mine back,"I bought this after using a cheap Norelco rotary shaver which eventually needed a new head. That cost $30. I figures I'd spend a little more and get this one which was rated #2 by consumer reports. I used it for a month and sent it back. Why? In order of importance:It doesn't shave as well. Especially on my neck. The popup trimmer facing the right direction helped with the neck a little, but not a lot. Neither shaver gives as good a shave as a real blade. This shave was OK but not as good as the Norelco.It pinches. Even after a few weeks for my face to get used to it, it still pinched me - not every time but every couple of times. The Norelco was more comfortable on my face.It's loud. Yes I knew this going in. If that were the only problem it would be no problem.On the positive - it is convenient like any electric. And the charge lasted longer than the 20 shaves they said it would."
4,Remington MS2-390,"Nice clean shave. Seems to get what others could not or those difficult areas. Washable, easy to clean. Handling is a little awkward until you get used to it. More noisy than others I've had. I would recommend this shaver."
4,"""Best buy""","This is an inexpensive razor that works quite well. It is not perfect; longish hairs sometimes seem unable to get in the foil openings (why I've awarded 4 and not 5 stars). but for the price it gives a fine shave. Fits comfortably in my hand; charges quickly. Its noise level does not bother me. For special occasions and an occasional touch-up I still go Gillette Mach 5, but this is just fine most of the time.ADDENDUM I've now been using it daily for about three years, and I still like it. I have replaced the foil and cutters yearly, so it continues to work well. I highly recommend having a spare foil at all time; it can tear unexpectedly. The only other issue is that the battery now needs to be recharged after every use, not after every three or so as was true when it was new. This is a minor inconvenience,as it still does work fine and never runs out of power before I'm done. Still need to use the Mach 5 occasionally."
1,The foil screen separated from its attachment after just a few shaves.,"One of the two foils, (which is what touches your face, and covers the blades), separated from its attachment after just a few shaves, exposing the blade and making the razor useless. I am returning the razor for a refund."
2,Buy some ear plugs,"As a shaver, its fine no more no less. It shaves reasonably well and its trimmer is pretty effective.But it is so so noisy. Stupidly loud, I needed to use it so I kept it, but really dont buy this shaver it offers nothing extra for the money and may even damage hearing (so close to your ears and all that)A waste."
4,Does the job,"This is my second purchase of this model. I bought the first one a number of years ago and it has traveled around the world. It still works in the plug-in mode, but the battery is nearly worn out; I get only 1 or 2 shaves per charge. Time for a new one. It works fine and a full charge gives about 2 weeks of shaves. The shave is quite good, but not great. I have not compared it's shave with the really expensive brands, they seem too expensive for any improvement. I wish it was easier to purchase the replacement screen only (ie, not including the cutters, which last much longer)."
1,Terrible performance.,"I really expected better from a Remington product. Shame on me, I guess. Bought this as an Amazon lightning deal, and boy does the old ""you get what you pay for"" adage hold true. Except in this case, it's even worse than that. The razor flat out doesn't shave. It pretends to, and it may even get a hair or two by mistake, but you have to run it over the same patch of skin some 5 or 6 times, and it still won't leave anything NEAR a clean shave. I bought this because I was tired of spending so much on disposables, and guess what? The piece-of-junk Bic disposables do a better job than this unit. I would return it, if I still had the box. Do yourself a favor, and buy something else."
1,Not a product to buy,"I purchsed this product in August of 2011 and have been using it on a daily basis. As of December 11, 2011 the razor will no longer run. The battery has gone flat and will not accept a charge.I have replaced the razor with a different manufacturer. I have used electric razors for the past 25 years and the Remington MS2-390 is the worst razor I have ever had and now it has stopped after less than 4 months use.DO NOT BUY A REMINGTON PRODUCT - YOU WILL BE SORRY"
4,Remington MS2-390 Electric razor,A good razor for the price. This is my 3rd Remington Razor & is the best I've had so far. Shaves fast & cleaning it is easy. Hope it lasts more than 3 years.
5,happy shaver,Received the electric razor promtly and am happy withit. It does take a week or two to get used to it but oncethis happens you are quited satisfied with it.
4,Good Razor,This razor is an upgrade from another Remington razor. It is much better and shaves faster. The only thing I don't is the blinking light which tells you the razor is at full charge. Then you have to unplug the razor if you don't want to see the light continuing to flash.
4,Good product.,"'Works well. A bit noisier than I'd like, but trims and shaves well. This is my second one of this type. Replacement heads are expensive, so opted for a new unit."
1,Stops working,Stops working after a few weeks...Turns on and after a few minutes shuts off...even with a full charge.Was bought as a Christmas gift that don't work!
4,Good value for a great razor,Very good razor. Shaves closely. I have a Braun which was twice the price. Both shave equally well. The Remington is easy to clean. If there is anything that is a weakness is that it is a little loud.
2,new shaver foil screen breaks after two weeks,Second gift shaver for my husband This one the foil broke within the first two weeks of shaving during weekdays At this point in time our family is giving up on electric shavers My husband and both sons are wet shaving These shavers are not well built for the money to purchase themtj cox albany ny
5,Works on heavy beard,"For years I have avoided electric razors because I was convinced that they could not handle my heavy beard. That was before I began adding up the cost of disposible razors. I read the ratings and found the MS2-390 a consumer reports best buy and thought I'd give it a try. I was amazed. This shaver shaves me as close as a razor. Even my razor blades could miss part of my beard, but the Remington is equal or better. My wife can't believe the closeness of the shave. I find it easy to clean and while some reviews call it noisy, I don't find it the least bit loud. Why spend $180. when you can get a great shave at 60? I figure even if this lasts for one year, I'm still ahead in terms of cost of shave cream, blades, water and time."
4,Fine,"I was a long time safety razor guy who had to switch or bleed to death. I'm still learning how to shave with an electric razor, but I'm gaining ground. The Remington has been everything I hoped it would be at a reasonable price. I can't believe how long the charge has lasted. I've been using it for a month now on the initial charge. I'm very pleased with my purchase and can't imagine spending three times as much for a big name would give me a closer shave."
1,Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver,"This is a comfortable shaver which will remain charged through many shaving cycles. It provides a close shave to the flat areas, but when it comes to the compound curves at the base of the jaw near the ears and neck, it requires a bunch of work and time to get a good shave.The head must be held exactly flat, OR the edge of the screen or the trimmer will catch the whiskers, and THAT is not real comfortable. After a couple of pulls, you learn the technique pretty quickly. The hair trimmer just doesn't retract FAR ENOUGH to be completely clear of the shaving heads.I am a long-time Remington person; the last one is no longer built or I would have bought it instead. This one was a top recommendation of CR. It has actually driven me back to shaving with a blade, believe it or not.I would not buy this again nor recommend it to anyone."
2,not good on the neck,We ended up sending this back because it did not shave my husband's neck very well. Other than this I think he thought it was ok.
2,Disappointing,"I bought this shaver for my boyfriend who never had an electric shaver before. The idea of getting the electric shaver was to shorten the shaving time but this one made it dramatically longer. The first shave took over 30 minutes. I thought maybe he was doing it wrong but his father even coached him and he did everything the package said but it didn't get much better. The package does say that it will get faster in time but it hasn't gotten to the 3-5 minute shave my dad and sister's boyfriend has. It now takes him 10-15 minutes to shave with this razor and he still has to use non electrical razors to get everything. He gets a sort of razor rash with it too. He does have thick hair and sensitive skin so that may have to do with it. So yeah, if you are like him, don't but this shaver...It may work for those with thick skin and thin hair, that's the only reason why I didn't give it one star."
2,not as good as previous models,This model Remington MS2 390 takes at least 2 to 3 minutes longer per shave than previous models. One foil lasted only 2 months. Please go back to a 3 cutter model. It needs charging more often because of time to complete your shave.To get info from this co. you are advised to see one of their local autorised repair services. Mine is 3o miles away.Purchased at Amazon.com
3,works okay,"Pretty good shaver for the $$. You have to run it MANY times over your face to get a reasonable shave and it is not a terribly ""close"" shave but it is good for a quick shave when there is not much time. When a really close shave is needed, probably best to go with a blade..."
3,NEEDS PRECONDITIONING,"FIRST SEVERAL WEEKS FELT LIKE THE THING WAS PULLING THE BEARD OUT INSTEAD OF CUTTING IT OFF.INSTRUCTIONS CAUTION IT TAKES SEVERAL WEEKS TO GET TO OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE, BUT REALLY...."
3,A poor man's razor,"I needed a razor for shaving in a hurray. This razor cuts the beard fine but it is very rough on the face. It does not scratch your face but has harsh edges on the razor head that is abrasive to dry shin. It has a very loud sounding motor also. Like always, you get what you pay for."
2,Disappointing,"I've had the Remington MS2-390 for about a year now and I'm disappointed with my purchase. I give it 2 stars because it provides about a 2 star shave. I can't get a closeness that gives that ""just shaved"" look and it creates hair ""dust"" that shoots up your nose and all around the sink when you're shaving. When you blow your nose afterward, there is dust that comes out. Not a shaver I would recommend."
1,Not worth it,I bought this shaver in June and already went through four screens in 9 months. They only send replacement screens once and you have to buy them for $24 every six months. Too much hassle and not worth it!
1,NOISEY,"This razor is highly overrated by Consumer Reports. It is extraordinality noisey and annoying. It also cut my face, which defeats the major reason I use an electric razor. Try a rotary razor."
2,Annoying,"Before I ordered this, I had read a few reviews on here saying that this shaver is a bit noisy... but wow. As soon as I turned it on for the first time it took me by surprise. This has an incredibly annoying and loud buzzing sound - loud enough to perhaps wake someone up in another room. First time shaving with this thing left me with cuts and random hairs peaking out all over my neck. Unfortunately, I wound up finishing the job with my other razor. I would strongly recommend buying something, anything, other than this. I have owned cheaper and much better shavers in the past."
4,Remington Razor,"The Remington Microscreen rechargeable razor is a good product. It gives a close shave if you insure that you've covered all areas thoroughly.It does leave some longer sthat lay down against the face which you have to go back and cut with the trimmer. Following a 24 hour recharge the battery stays charged for about a week before needing to be recharged.Overall, I'd say that Remington Microscreen 500 is an 8 out of 10 when compared to a blade. It's quick and easy."
4,happy overall,"I'm new to electric shaving so I don't any comparisons to other products. I am however very happy with my MS2-39 Microscreen 500. Except for a couple of areas on my neck, it provides a close shave. I'm also happy with the simplicity of use and the long battery life before it has to be recharged."
2,Less than hoped for,"This foil shaver was rated a ""Best Buy"" in Consumer Reports, but I found it less effective than the old rotary electric I'd been using. It misses numerous whiskers, even after repeated strokes. The charging-alert light comes on sooner than expected, and it was only after receiving the shaver that I learned its battery is not replaceable, which means that when it dies the shaver is finished. Remington says it should last 4 to 5 years, but that sounds iffy. Also, if you have to plug it in for a recharge so often, you might as well use a corded razor to begin with."
1,I pass on this razor,I purchased this razor based on Computer Reports evaluation. It was not as good as the review
2,Remington MS2-390 Electric Shaver,"I read all the customer rave reviews on this shaver which led me to purchase. I've had it for over a month and quite frankly, I'm disappointed. I've always used expensive Norelco's in the past and have had no complaints with them. I'm retired so I don't have to shave my tough beard every day. Number One: If you are like me this is not the razor for you. If your growth is a couple of days old, expect to spend quite some time in front of the mirror. This thing takes forever and really does not give a close a shave as my past Norelco's. Number Two: It is very noisy. Number Three: The pop up trimmer does not 'pop-up' I have to pull it up to use. Any body want to buy a slightly used Remington? I'm going to order another Norelco..Ted EvansCape May, NJ"
1,Terrible Shaver,the worst electric shaver I have ever used. I want my money back! only thing that works is the trimmer that pops up.
2,rated well but did not work for us,"Bought this because Consumer Reports rated it well, and it may be a great product if you like the foil style. My husband went back to using the rotary or a 'disposable' razor after just a couple of weeks. Just didn't shave close enough."
4,"Very good, but not perfect","This does shave very close. But you have to make several passes in different directions to get the close shave, otherwise it actually skips whiskers."
3,"Close, but loud shave","The shaver provides a pretty close shave, but it sounds like a 2 stroke engine running the thing. The trimmer on mine doesn't pop up quickly, either. I'm not sure if that is by design, or if mine is just flawed. Overall, if you just need a shaver to do the job, and nothing else, this is fine. However, if you want one that makes you want to shave (if there is such a thing) then go for a higher end model."
4,Good shaver for a good price,The Remington MS2-390 works fine. A decent shaver at a good price. Delivered as promised. Recommend to anyone looking for a shaver in the under $100 price range.
4,remington shaver,very good shaver; top rated by consumer reports and very inexpensive; even for a rotary shaver user this product shaves very close. the only issue is the top which has a tendency to come off easily
1,Noise level not acceptable,"This shaver may have been rated highly but the decibel level is so high that it is nearly impossible to use. This level of noise can't possibly be acceptable for one's hearing. I'm amazed that these items don't have to pass a hearing safety review before they're put on the market when they are used so close to one's ears. After less than two weeks this shaver went right back to the store. It doesn't matter how close the shave is, although it pulled quite a bit anyway, it's not worth it at the risk of one's hearing. I wish I'd listened to other reviewers before I bought this shaver!"
4,Close shaves,"I bought this razor because it was rated well by Consumer Reports. So far, I haven't been disappointed. It's a great razor for it's relatively low cost.Pros:* Close shaves. Best shave I've gotten from an electric razor.* Light indicates when battery is low.* Charges quickly.Cons:* Loud.* Battery life isn't the best."
2,a noisey shaver,I am so far disatisfied with this purchase because it is so loud when it is running that I am almost ready to use ear plugs. It cuts my beard o.k. and the trimmer works well and is easy to clean but annoying compared to my old rotary head shaver
4,Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver (Purchased on 11/18/2008),"So far it's doing what it's supposed to do. It shaves reasonably efficiently, the battery holds up for over a week of shaves, and the low-battery light, which provides a 5-minute warning, is a nice convenience. The shaver runs at nearly full tilt until the battery is dead. Then it's easy to continue with the shaver plugged in. The adapter, however, is awfully bulky compared with some previous models."
5,It's the best electric shaver!,"I've used several different brands/models of electric shavers and this Remington MS2-390 Microscreen works the best. Even though this shaver is kind of noisy, I would still highly recommend it. This model gives a very close shave without leaving your face irritated because you don't have to keep shaving over the same area over and over to get the job done."
2,Hair ripping and heavy,"Despite what the reviewers had to say this was not the shaver I had been hoping for. First, the shaver was too heavy and uncomfortable to handle. Second, and more disturbing was that it pulled the hairs on my neck instead of cutting them. Shaving should be a pleasure and a good shaver should make that a simple convenience. This one made shaving a dreadful and painful experience."
5,Remington MS2-390,The best electric shaver I have ever owned. Cuts my very tough beard as well as I have ever been able to with a razor and with less irritation. I also like that I can use it with the cord if the battery dies midshave.
3,A little disappointed,"I purchased this shaver after reading a favorable review in a leading consumer magazine. I have owned several other electric shavers and would rate the Remington above Norelco but inferior to a comparable Braun. Compared to my Braun, the Remington is nosier, flimsier, and is less effective on the neck hairs. Its not a bad shave but I was expecting better. I rate it 3 stars on a scale where no electric deserves 5 stars."
4,"Pretty Good, for an Electric Razor","I use an electric razor on my legs when I am too lazy to shave them ""the long way"" in the shower. It is never as good as shaving cream and razor (and I've tried many electric razors). This one is as good as an electric razor gets, I guess. I had purchased a Norelco and returned it after a month (they said to let the skin and hair adjust to it over a three week period - I did, but it was still a lousy shave). If I go really slowly I do get an OK shave with the Remington."
1,A chore to shave with,"I've had this shaver for over a year and the battery is shot on it (it shaves for about 45-60 seconds before I need to plug it in to finish shaving. It misses hairs all over, especially on the neck. Consumer Reports rated it highly, but according to the customer reviews they dropped the ball on this one."
1,poor quality,The reason I purchased this RAZOR was to replace the same model I had worn out. This one is bad the cutters do not fit down in the holders there for in the short time I have had the Remington RAZOR despite using {Remington} lubricant it has destroyed A set of cutters and foils.It also did A number on my FACE THE RAZOR IS JUNK!!!
2,Owners need earplugs for shaving with this shaver,"Based on the Consumer Reports rating, I bought this shaver inspite of the fact that the fine print of CR evaluation warned me about the noise problem. I didn't believe that the noise could be that bad. How wrong I was I didn't know until I tried the Remmington shaver.I couldn't shave in the bathroom even when the the door was closed without waking up may wife. As the shaving quality is concerned, my Philips Norelco rotary blade shaver is far less noizy and leave me with a smoother face regardless I use it on wet or dry face. Remington can only be used on dry face."
3,"good razor but....,","I have used electric razors for over 20 years.when Consumer Reports said this was the best I ordered it the same day. The good part is it shaves very close and a charge lasts a long while. The bad part is it pulls the whiskers, It always seems to catch them and pull them out. It is hard to avoid this action. Also the razor is very loud. If it is early in the morning I need to use a blade so I don't wake up the house. I am hoping this razor does not last too long as I am anxoious to buy another Wahl which have always done a great job for me and are priced right. (I don't work for the company, just love the product)"
3,Good Razor But VERY LOUD.,"I bought this electric Remington on Amazon a short time ago. The quality of the shave is quite good. But I was surprised that this razor is very loud, so loud that it is actually quite unpleasant to use it on my face next to my ears."
3,Remington MS2-390 electric shaver,"This is my second purchase of this product, the first being several years ago. The pop up trimmer failed to retract during the second shave. Also, the removable head came loose and had to be pushed back down during that same shave, a problem that I was familiar with from the previous unit I owned. I returned the razor and received a replacement several days later. The new one seems to be okay. The shave is okay though not spectacular but for the price I am satisfied."
2,MS2-390 Experience,The MS2-390 is similar to other Remington products I've used. I find it not as acceptable as the others: too noisy and the trimming blade does not readily extend. It seems to do about the same job but it not as convenient. Maybe the design is tired.
1,On second use trimmer extended and will not reset & hold,"I bought this one to replace the Remington shaver that I got about 10 years ago, when the battery finally failed to recharge. I use this shaver only for when I travel. I use a Braun series 7 or a wet shave when at home.On the second use, on my first trip, the trimmer extended (by itself) and will not hold when I push it back in. This renders the shaver essentially useless to shave. So with 1 day to spare, I'm returning it to Amazon..When it worked, it did a good enough job with cutting my beard; it's light and powerful and cut without pulling too much."
2,Wouldnt purchase another,Had an older model Remington that after a year or so just broke apart. Got this model now and it does not shave nearly as close and takes forever to get the job done.
3,like an alarm clock in your face!,I've used similar Remington Microscreen shavers for a number of years and they work well. The reason I had to replace my last one is I could no longer find the replacement cutter heads. While I'm quite satisfied with the performance of this MS2-390 I am less than happy about how loud it is! Honestly it is like holding a loud electric alarm clock to your face! I even plug my ears when I shave close to them!
2,Not Happy,"This Remmington MS2_390 didn't produce as close a shave as my old 3 head Rem and was excessivly noisey. Going back to my Panasonic 8103, which I'm not all that crazy about. It is easier on the ears and shaves better, but still not as good as that old 3 head Rem MS3 2000."
3,Good shave - Loud as a chain saw,"I've used remington foil shavers in the past and been relatively pleased with them. The last was a triple head shaver and I used it for several years. This razor does not have the same quality of my previous remingtons.My observations:1. Power switch is hard to operate. It feels very cheap.2. The trimmer pops up VERY SLOWLY. Go take a nap and come back...3. This razor sounds like a weedeater or chainsaw. VERY LOUD!4. All this being said, this razor does give a good shave.Bottom line, if you want a good shave and don't care about noise or the overall ""feel"" of the shaver, then this is for you. Otherwise, keep shopping."
1,Terrible,"This razor was reviewed as one of the best but this thing was like putting a weed-wacker on my face. This thing constantly ate up my face and gave me terrible razor burn, not to mention trying to shave my neck...forget about it. You're better off spending a little more money and getting something better. Saving money is not worth the pain."
5,Fast and Close Shave,"Given a high rating in Consumer Reports, this shaver lives up to its review. I have used various electric shavers for 20 years or more, and this one shaves faster and closer than any I've used. It won't cut up your face and it will save time. It recharges in an hour and can be rinsed with water.It is noisy and the protractable trimmer is awkward, and if these matters are important to you, then you might look elsewhere.But if a fast, close shave is what you're looking for, then you'll get a winner."
3,OK for the price,"My Norelco gave it up after many years and I purchased this based on price and CR review. It is better than the last Remington I owed a while ago. It shaves as close as any electric but takes a little longer. I have had it a few weeks and it is still on the original charge. So good battery life. My biggest gripe, over the length of time it takes to shave, is the noise. It is much louder than the Norelco."
4,A little noisy but excellent shaving,"I was very pleased with the performance of the Remington MS2-390. It is a little bulky and a little noisy compared to my previous shaver, the Braun 1775, but much better shaving. It is also easy to clean. As you probably know, it is the latest consumer report's best buy. It is also a little expensive compared to the Braun 1775, which used to be another CR best buy. All in all, I like this one much better."
4,Quality Electric Shaver,Important things I like about the product.1. Very Close Shave2. No pinching what so ever.3. Long battery life between recharges. At least 3 weeks so far.So far there is nothing I dislike about the shaver or it's performance. If it works this well for the next year then I would rate it five stars but I just purchased it 3 weeks ago.And one little bonus. It was fully charged when I received it. Many rechargeable items have to be charged for 24 uninterrupted hours before first use. Not this Manufacturer. They charged their phone before shipping to me. A little extra that shows they care about their customer.I am very happy with this product.
2,Not the best - Pop Up Trimmer Sucks,This didn't give a very good shave. Did the job for a while without complaint but then got dull real fast. After a year or so the pop-up trimmer stopped working. They say you can clean with water but I think the water rusted the spring on the pop-up or something. My Braun has lasted longer and is much easier to clean. These microscreens don't rinse out too well. You still have to dig in and clean stuff out. My Braun rinses clean and after 2 year without replacing anything it still gives a good shave.
3,Good shave but deafening,This is a comfortabe and fast shaver but it is very loud. If you need to be quiet in the morning or need your hearing in the future I guess you'll need to spend a little more money for a better engineered razor.
4,Great value,"I'd been a Norelco shaver for years, but am really enjoying my first Remington electric razor. This one is a great value. As the other reviews of it I read indicated, it's a little on the noisy side. But it gives a close shave, a charge lasts at least two weeks, and it takes only an hour to recharge the battery. We'll see how the cutters, screens, and razor itself hold up over the long haul."
4,Shaver Review,"I am very pleased with this shaver. It provides a very close and comfortable shave with minimum effort. Much better than previous Microscreen from Remington. Was able to get five days without recharging with no problem. It is well balanced and easy and comfortable to hold. Two small areas could be improved: (1) improvement could be in the off/on button which requires two hands to operate; and (2) during cleaning, the cutter blade will sometimes come off - but is easy to reassemble. Yes - I would definitely buy it again."
4,Very satisfied.,"I purchased this shaver for my husband for Christmas after much research. I was a bit nervous about some of the negative feedback (ie: too loud, doesn't cut longer hairs etc). My husband has a rough curly beard, and has suffered from ingrown hairs for years. Although it took about 3 weeks for his neck and face to adjust to it, most of his ingrown hairs have cleared up. This razor is not irritatingly noisy either. On a scale of 1 - 10, its about a 4 on noise level. Thus far, he's very satisfied with this product and prefers it over using a standard wet shaver."
1,inferior shaver,"Poor qualityHad to replace Foil within 3 weekVery frail foil, heads break through. Plastic head fall off easilyVery poorly made, had to tape it so it would not dislodge.Good shave but retired after 4 months and 2 sets of foil replacements, very costly"
1,Bad quality; mediocre shave,"I have had this razor for 14 months. I bought it based on consumer reports recommendation. I never thought it gave me a very good shave, but the real reason I am giving it one star is that this razor completely started falling apart after 8 months and now I cannot even use it. The screen won't stay on, the sideburner trimmer won't stay down (you have to hold it down with your fingers), and the power button won't stay on unless I hold it down with my finger! I literally need three hands to shave and believe me, the shave this thing gave me was never worth it to begin with. Piece of junk."
1,I must have a different /mislabled razor.. this one is terrible,* Force the charger cable in to get it to charge as it's such a tight fit you swear you have it in wrong.* When you turn it on it sound like 300 ducks flying over your bathroom. So loud when I use it I close the door to not disturb the whole house. And when travelling have fear of person in next hotel room will come over and pummel me for the noise.* You have to shave the same sport 20-30 times to get it to cut all stubble. Think raw skin..* Forget missing a day and have more than 30 minutes of growth. As it will pinch and pull your hair and in the end will miss most of it. You'll have to use the trimmer or get your manual razor out.* Foils/cutters expensive. Mine got a whole in it so had to get from local walmart and they were $25..1/2 cost of razor.. Do see them on line for less so that is good.* Run from this razor..Use your garden hedge trimmer instead.. you get about the same results on your face.
1,Remington MS2-390,TOO LOUD--POOR CUTTING --ALL AROUND THE WORST ELECTRIC RAZOR I;VE USED IN THE PAST 40 YEARS! It's going in the garbage where it belongs.
1,don't buy this one,"I bought this razor because Consumer Reports rated it a best buy. However, after using it for only 4 months, I will buy another razor and not a Remington. This razor misses a lot of whiskers and when they grow out just a bit, it will no longer cut them. It also does not trim the side burns very well.By the way, I am also cancelling my subscription to Consumer Reports based on this product rating."
3,Just OK,I have had this razor for about two months now and I have gone back to my old shaver. I have had to replace the razor screen twice already. Not worth the cost considering the number of screen heads you will be buying with this model.
2,Not as good as all that,"I've had various Norelcos for decades, but I got tired of spending so much money only to have the battery completely die (and hence have to buy a new shaver) after what I thought to be a relatively short time.So I bought this Remington.Disappointed.First, it does a poor job on the neck, and gives me lots of nicks. Second, it takes far longer to shave than did any Norelco I've ever owned. Lastly, after less than a year the battery completely died and the shaver is useless. Thus I am effectively paying more for an inferior product.I'm switching back to Norelco."
1,Sloppy construction,"At the recommendation of my oncologist I purchased this razor due to the anticipated treatment's effects on my facial skin. When I used the razor I noted scratches and bleeding on my now bald head and facial cheeks. Upon examination of the shaving face I found it was cracked with sharp edges. A letter was sent to the customer service department explaining the defect and requesting a replacement of that part; however, after six weeks they are yet to respond and I am stuck with a lemon. NICE!"
3,Average,"Reading all of the good reviews and ratings that this shaver received gave me high expectations. The shaving is average, I don't get the close and smooth shave as I did with my older norelco but my Norelco shaver died after two years of usage. I guess for the price I paid (about $50) it is an ok product. I'm still having a hard time getting used to the loud noise of this shaver."
4,Not unusually noisy,"After reading reviews both on Amazon and elsewhere, I almost did not purchase this shaver because of the reported noise levels. I do not find it much, if any, louder than the Braun I have been using. Does a good job shaving and I am satisfied with the quality for the cost."
1,CR Best Buy - NOT!,"I bought this shaver to replace an old Norelco rotary shaver. CR listed it as a best buy and the reviews are great. I was VERY disappointed in the results. Each hair is cut by a row of blades vibrating very quickly, which by the way is very noisy. Each hair has to poke through the ""microscreen"" to get cut. I had lots of missed hairs and they are totally random. I used Remington Face Saver so the results should be optimum. To get a full shave takes me at least twice as long as it did with the rotary shaver.This shaver is probably good enough if you use it twice a day. That way the missed hairs will be less noticeable.This product is also VERY MESSY. Since the hairs are pulverized the ""dust"" goes everywhere when you clean it.I sent it back and bought a Norelco 8160XL. It was the same price as the 8140XL on Amazon. The cleaner is Norelco's way to get you to buy something (fluid) from them on a regular basis. I recommend the Norelco 8140XL."
4,Accepting change,"I checked many recommendations in this price range before buying the Remington MS2 390. Now that I am using the razor daily I discovered that it's take longer to shave around the chin, under nose, and neck. However, I also can walk to my closet and select the clothes or shoes for the day while shaving.I like the formed hand grip and I haven't had cuts or razor burn."
2,Way too noisey.,First impression was that there was something wrong. It is way louder than other shavers I've used and even drowns out my Remington hair dryer. Cuts and trims well.
2,Great shaver.,Great shaver. 4 stars only because it is a bit noisy. Holds a charge for a several shaves. I would highly recommend this product.
4,Great shaver.,"I'm an African American male and needed a good electric shaver to shave off my goatee and trim my mustache. The only hair on my face is mustache and goatee and I like to shave the goatee clean off. And I needed one that wouldn't cause ingrown hairs and razor bumps. After reading several reviews I decided to give this one a try. After using it for about 3 or 4 weeks, I have to say that I really like it. The built in trimmer does a satisfactory job and the shaver shaves close without irritation. Also, I haven't had any razor bumps from using this shaver. It charges up quickly and holds the charge for several shaves. Good shaver. Give it a try."
5,A Great Razor,"I have had several electric shavers. This one is the largest of all of them, but that is the only negative. Since I have a tendancy for ingrown hairs, I shave first with a double edge regular razor and shaving cream when in the shower. After drying the chin, I then shave with the electric shaver. I believe the electric shaver works best when the hair is quite short, hence the double treatment.The shaver works quite well in this process. I highly recommend it. It leaves the skin smooth and extreemly few ingrown hairs."
4,Was it new?,"The shaver arrived quickly. I noticed that the shaver had been re-packaged, so I'm not sure if it was new or used. I had ordered a new one. But it works OK. I switched to this shaver from a rotary type so there was a brief adjusting period. It provides a good close shave."
2,Review of Remington MS2-390 Shaver,"I purchased this shaver on the strength of a favorable review in Consumer Reports. The first one I ordered failed to hold a charge, so I had to send it back at my own expense. The company did send me a new one, which seems to be working better. Time will tell, as they say it takes several charge/recharge cycles. It shaves OK, although it has a tendency to pull when I shave my neck. I would not recommend this shaver."
2,"Noisy, heavy, cheap, and smells toxic too","I bought this shaver because it was tested well in Consumer Reports magazine. Some things I really did not like switching from Norelco: Shaver is kind of heavy compared to the Norelco. The shaver is extremely noisy, I had to close the bathroom door not to wake up others. The material is cheap and the plastic starts peeling of after just a few months. The shaver smells funny when you first get it, like it's from a factory that uses highly toxic materials. I did like it that the beard trimmer could be used together with the normal shaving head, so that it would cut stubborn neck hair easier, and you get a few less ingrowns than the Norelco. I am back to using my old Norelco again and just tossed the Remmington (which makes loud sound in the garbage bin due to its weight)."
2,Not Happy,"The front screen wore out(small holes) after only one week,and was VERY difficult in removing to replace. I guess youget what you pay for. Holliston,Massachusetts."
2,Use another razor,"I bought the Remington MS2-390 about a month ago. It is a good price and shaves fair. If you want a quick shave, and still want stubs left on you face, this is the razor to use. But to be fair I have a very rough beard."
2,Not for me,"I had very high hopes for this razor, which is rated a ""Best Buy"" in Consumer Reports. The problem with this type of razor is that is could not shave closely in and out of the contours of my neck, and I would have to repeat the process several times before hair was removed. It was also noisier than my 17-year-old Norelco. In the end, I sent back this razor and bought a cordless Norelco, which is far better at removing facial hair in less time, and it is much quieter as well."
4,"Noisy, but effective","I had read a review that this shaver works well, but is noisy. I agree with both points. The loudness can be tolerated, since it has given me a really good shave. My beard isn't all that tough, or thick, but I've frequently had a hard time feeling like I've had a close shave--the kind you get with a razor. I would have given it five stars, except for its volume."
1,remington ms2-390 razor,I sent mine back the next week of getting it. The cutters cut a big cut on my face when the foil failed. I would NOT recommend this razor to my worst enemy. Don't Buy It!!!
3,NOT Dual-Voltage,"In this day and time, when people are traveling internationally for business and pleasure, it just doesn't make any sense for a shaver to not be dual-voltage. Plug this shaver into an outlet in Germany or the Middle East and you will fry it--as I did. I thought ALL such appliances were dual-voltage by now. My Braun 370 razor can be used anywhere.This razor is fine if you never leave the States, but you cannot take a long vacation or business trip overseas and recharge it without a heavy and bulky transformer.Remington needs to step up to the plate and make an electric razor that can be used anywhere in the world!"
2,Retiree,I returned the razor within the 30 day period. It was too noisy and did not shave as well as I expected.
5,Great Electric Shaver,"This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It provides by far the closest shave and is the easiest to clean. Shaving time is about the same as with other electric shavers I have used. I have purchased a number of more expensive shavers (Norelco and Braun) over the past 40 years, so I was reluctant to even try a less expensive model. I went with Consumer Reports' recommendation and it was a winner! I would high recommend this product."
4,Remington MS2-390,I have been using this Shaver for a while now. No problems so far. Shaves close for an electric. Microscreens wear out a little too soon for me.
3,Ok for the price,"For the money this unit is acceptable.Good points: Ergonomics, Easy to clean, Nice design, Good battery life, Good trimmer, PriceDown side: Shaver wants to pull beard if you don't shave every day, Not as consistent a shave as other razors, head keeps popping off unexpectedly.I bought a really cheap Remington rechargable at Big Lots for $15. It lasted a couple of years and was outstanding for the money. Based on that one I bought the MS2-390. It should be better but its not. I do have a very tough beard so I'm a work out for some shavers but I had better luck with a Braun than this Remington."
1,Shoddy product,"I was disappointed by my recent purchase of the MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver. Within 3 weeks the pop-up whisker shaver spring was broken where I must tape it down with duct tape in order to continue shaving with it until I can contact Remington's customer service. I bought it to replace the same shaver because after 3 years, the battery does not recharge for long and I cannot just plug the previous shaver into the socket as advertised and use it on AC. In addition, the previous Remington rubberized 'on' button had deteriorated. If I do not get quick satisfaction, I will go back to Norelco."
1,Ouch!,"At first I liked this razor, but within two weeks of use the microscreen somehow got a tear in it and the razor cut my face while using it. I don't know how the tear occured, but it did. I returned it for my money back and plan to buy another Norelco rotary."
2,Remington Shaver MS2-390,"Purchased this based on Consumer Reports saying it was a ""best Buy"". So far it has not lived up to their rating. I am going to try using a pre-shave product from Remington to see if that helps in getting a better shave. As of now I would not recommend this shaver."
2,reviewing shaver,"The razor is very noisey.Shaved too close to the skin, causing skin problems. Have to press very lightly against the skin to keep the unit from cutting the skin."
5,Remington MS2-390 Men's Shaver,"The best electric razor I have ever had, Just fallow directions and take about 2 weeks to condition your face."
5,Remington Shaver,"I'm very impressed with this shaver. It gives a much closer shave than the Norelco I used in the past, and holds a charge well."
5,Remington MS2-390 Shaver,"I was looking for a good shaver for my boyfriend. He's an over the road truck driver, so using a razor isn't usually an option. I read the reviews of the Remington MS2-390 shaver and decided to buy it for him.He LOVES it!! It gives him a really good shave and he said the charge lasts forever! He was out 12 days on his last run and said he didn't have to recharge the whole time. He likes that it can be used corded (in case the battery would run down) or cordless, and that it came with a travel bag. I think it's nice that you can rinse it in water but, again, he usually doesn't have that option.In closing, he said it was the best gift I could have gotten for him. He had previously used a triple-head shaver and he likes the Remington so much better.Linda"
1,bad shave,I have never had an electric razor that actually worked. I still do not. I have only used it once but after trying for some time to grt a close shave I gave up. I would never recommend this shaver.
3,Shaves close but rediculous loud,"This razor seems to shave closer than my usual rotary razors but it does seem to have trouble with my neck, especially with the occasional hair that lays down sideways and doesn't stand up.My major beef with this razor, and I guess it would be any microscreen razor, is the noise. I live with others that don't get up as early as I do and I found myself worrying about waking them up with this razor because it's so insanely loud.That's why I returned it. If that's not your concern, then it is a good choice."
4,A very good buy.,"The Remington MicroScreen 500 MS2-390 gives a close shave at a very economical price. It's not as smooth as my old Norelco Rotary, but it gives a better shave. I'm definitely happy with the purchase."
4,Close shave at a reasonable price,I am pleased with the performance so far. I don't have to go over the same area numerous times to get a close shave and the shaver does not leave stray hairs behind that later have to be removed by the trimmer. The shaver also holds its charge for a much longer time than my previous shaver and has a handy indicator light that tells you when the charge is getting low.
1,Does not live up to other reviews,"I gave this shaver to my dad, my son and son-in-law for Christmas. None of them are happy with it. They all have spots that they just can't get at with this shaver. Huge disappointment. They say the shaver also catches their skin and it hurts. I do not recommend this product."
1,Does not cut hairs well,"Based on all the positive reviews, the experience must really depend on the person. I can say that I now have to return this shaver because it performs so badly when it comes to cutting hairs. It leave WAY too many hairs uncut, and it often doesnt help no matter how many times you go over it. The trimmer helps, but come on I'm not supposed to have to cut most of my neck and a good part of my face using the trimmer, thats a bad sign.I'm disappointed in Consumer Reports. This goes to show you that you always need to read numerous customer reviews not rely on one professional reviewer's opinion. If you look over the reviews here you'll see many customers complaining of exactly the same thing I am.Can anyone suggest a better razor than this one which doesnt have this issue? The cheap drugstore one I bought years ago even does a better job cutting than this one but I would like a better one that that old one."
2,Remington MS2-390 cordless shaver,I bought this shaver based on Consumer report's review. It does not come close to matching my Norelco rotary shaver. It does not shave as close and is noisy and runs like a Model T
5,Best Electric Razor Ever,I am in my late 60s and have used an electric razor all my life.This is the best one yet.
2,Pop-up trimmer broke; poor shave,"After using this for a few months I am not very happy with the purchase. I have a very soft, fine beard and this shaver does not cut it very well. It seems to flatten the beard and pass over the whiskers. As a result, I end up with a lot of long straggling whiskers that keep getting longer. I have to use the pop-up trimmer to get each of these. This worked OK for a while, but then the pop-up trimmer broke, so now I need to buy a different shaver."
1,Terrible Shave,"After two months of using this razor based on reviews here, I am throwing it away. Terrible shave...does poor job of removing hairs under chin. Do not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Remingtton MS2-390 shaver,This shaver is no good. If I could get my money back I would.It doesn't work worth a damn.Awful shave.Cut my chin.Painful.Doesn't cut whisker much at all.
3,Remington MS2-390 shaver,"Shaver is too noisy. It took an inordinate amount of time to get the right shaving position, especially under the chin."
4,sauerpower,"I like the product, but it was not made clear that the accessories I also ordered at the same time were to all be shipped separately, incuring additional shipping costs. Please make this more clear."
1,Poorly Designed & Constructed,I purchased this razor about 1 year ago an am very unhappy with it. It collects cuttings and they eventually jam the razor.The side burn cutter mechanism is poorly constructed and soon stops working necessitating taking thr razor apart to get it working again after cleaning out all the accumulated and compacted stuble.It may them work for a couple of weeks then it fails again.
2,No need to buy,Bought this based on Consumers Report. It misses a lot in same areas and then have to shave normally to get long whiskers. Not a good shaver.
2,Old shaving technology give so-so shave,"I used Remington electric razors from 1963 until 1995+ and then started buying Panasonic and similar Linear- high speed razors. I was surprised when this Remington got better reviews than any other brand. But when used the shaver, I found it no better than the 1990's version. I want to find that review and make certain to avoid that source, as it obviously was a OEM influenced ranking- where the highest fee or advertizing payment gets the best rating. Don't waste $50 on the Remington, invest $85 in the most economical Linear Panasonic."
2,Remington MS2-390 shaver,"I was disappointed with the shaver. I felt it gave me a ragged shave with a sore face in some tender areas after the use. The quality of the construction is not good. The trimmer had to be coached out of its parked place to use. As with a lot of products, the plastic packaging is a pain to open. I purchased the shaver on the basis of the Consumer Reports review. I was able to return it to Amazon for a full refund. So, the trial was nearly pain free."
4,Remington Razor,It's a good alternative to a safety razor if you have lots of time. It also will save money in the long run.
5,Best shaver I've had,"Yes, the best shaver. I had a little worry at first about the battery discharging time and the somewhat inadequate user's guide, which didn't adequately explain the best battery charging techniques. I phoned a nice customer rep who explained the correct way - it's a NiMH battery, by the way - but battery discharging time didn't improve. A second call was greeted by an offer to exchange for a new shaver. I hesitated, because I didn't want to let it go. But they shipped a new one, I returned the original in the same package, and now I'm quite happy with the new one, which displays a nice battery charging/discharging characteristic. Let's hope they'll come out with an improved battery section for the ""Use and Care Guide""."
1,Sounds Like A leafblower!,"This is unbelieveably noisy. Wow! Sounds like a leafblower. It shaves half descent but takes longer than my old Norelco. It also has a tendancy to nick.Now that I have replaced my battery in my Norelco, I am going back to it. After a month of using the Remington, I am tired of being ""attacked"" each morning. I'll keep it as a backup - only."
4,Good Value,"My husband needed new blades for his shaver, this was only $20 more and he got a new shaver, works well and was shipped very fast!"
5,REAL close shave!,"This razor shaves my face SO smooth, my wife has trouble telling the difference between my face, and a baby's butt! :<) Oh Well! Great razor, HIGHLY recomended.Phil B. CT"
3,Disappointing performance,"Slower than the 40 year old Remington Shaver it replaced. Also, one of two screens failed after six weeks of use.But now, after using it for six months, it is doing well, and better than the Braun Series 3 370 with which I have been comparing it."
4,Better than Braun,This razor is much better than the Braun razor I bought from Amazon but could not use as taking the head apart to clean it was a nightmare for a person such as I with limited vision. Couldn't return it so I gave it to my grandson and bought the Remington which is far superior.
4,Decent shaver,"I've used medium priced Remington and Braun shavers, never tried other brands. The Remington is a better shaver (at least in this category). It is not really a better shave but it is a smoother and faster shave. Maybe because it has twin heads and the braun one larger head. Not a big deal for me but the trimmer on the Braun is positioned more conveniently. The only issue for some people may be the noise. The Remington is noticeably louder than the Braun but I can't see why this would make a difference to anyone. If you're up in the morning and shaving with an electric shaver you're going to be heard anyway."
2,Slightly dissappointed,"I think that Remingston was one of the best shavers made. My first shaver was solid and shaved well. I had no complaints. I kept it as long as I could until the battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore and I could no longer replace the heads because they are no longer on the market. So I read a review on the new Remington shavers and chose the Remington MS2-390 Microscreen Rechargeable/Corded Men's Shaver. It shaves well, but when I opened the package after purchase, I found that the shaver head was warped. Remington sent me a new head. Then I used the trimmer, which pops up at the push of a button, and I could not get it to stay down after pushing it back into the closed position. I really had to work to get it to close and lock. The design of the shaver is a little awkward; sometimes when you hold the shaver in a different position, the shaver head pops off, because the release buttons protrude too much. The old shaver was the best. When you have a good thing, why change?"
2,What happened to your quality .,"I have had 5 Remington electric razors over the past 20 years , they have progressively gotten worse. My last one was purchased October 2010 this is a list of what is wrong with it1. Battery is worn out the razor will not run unless it remains plugged in.2. On and off button (rubber pad) has fallen off the last two razors.3. My shaves have to be followed by a blade for closenessI am buying a new Remington razor today they can give the closest shave when new but do not count on them for the long haul .Signed. M. L. DukeTooele UtahRetired school teacher."
3,"Gets close, for cheap","When the blades are new, it gets closer than any other electric I've used. I've kept it for 3 years and been happy the whole time.But:-The trimmer is nothing special. It can handle when your beard gets too long to shave, but dont expect it to do any real grooming.-It's loud. I don't really notice it anymore, but if you're into having conversations while you shave, this isn't for you.-It can't handle long hairs too well. I have to be careful not to miss a stray whisker that this thing doesn't catch.Still, I'd say buy it. I really doubt there's anything at this price that's better, and I'm still happy with it 3 years later. You're getting more than you pay for."
2,Replaced this Shaver with a Panasonic Shaver,"Purchased this shaver as a replacement for a similar model Remington. This shaver only lasted around a year before it started to be very loud and did not shave well at all. I will never use a Remington shaver again, therefore, I purchased a Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System and it is the best shaver I have ever owned."
4,Almost perfect,"This razor works great once you get one that actually fully operates. The first one I got, the trimmer did not work. I returned it and the second one works great. I really like the full width trimmer, when I don't shave over the weekend I just pop it up to the halfway mark and it gives me a great preshave. I have a goatee and I have no problem using it to shape up. I don't know why people complain about the trimmer being too big, it works fine for me."
3,met expectation,"met expectation for an electric razor. Does not shave close, like a 3 or 4 blade razor and soap. It will do."
2,Item returned,"After using Norelco rotary shavers for many years I decided to try this Remington, based on a review by Consumer Reports.Frequent nicks and constant irritated skin over a three week period made me decide this shaver was not meant for me. I am again back to my Norelco."
1,Shaver doesn't shave,"This shaver just rolls over my beard, doesn't cut at all. I'd have returned it but I let too much time go by. You may see it on eBay sometime. Maybe you have to use it every day on very short hair, maybe I'll try that. Or maybe you have to use some pre-shave product or something. I've still found nothing better than the most inexpensive disposable razors."
4,Remington MS2-390,Shaver is excellent. I have been using a rotary and this shaver gives a superior shave. It is a little noisier. Only problem was something internal (sounded like a small screw) was loose. Returned it to the factory and got a prompt replacement.
4,Nice but can cause hearing damage,"Just before this purchase, I bought another brand and regretted it. So I'm back to the Remington family.This shaver works great, and the trimmer is typical solid Remington.My only ""beef"" is the noise. It's not casually loud, it's monstrous! I literally end up wearing ear plugs when I shave or my ears will ring afterward."
1,Not the Remington I used to know !,"Shaver is EXTREMELY loud and with HIGH pitched noise, and INFERIOR manufacturing quality. Not the Remington I knew! 0 star, not even 1 star."
2,Not a good thing,"The razor was deficient in several ways. First and foremost, it didn't do a good job of shaving. It did not shave close at all, leaving a 5 0'clock beard when finished. Also, it was not agile. There were two places on my neck that it just did not hit, no matter what I did. Finally, it was noisy. I returned the product."
1,Very Noisy Shaver,"The design was nice and it was comfortable to hold but this shaver was so loud when I turned it on that our dog came running into the bathroom to see what the noise was all about. It's unfortunate because I had read good reviews about this product. I didn't want to have to shave with earplugs, so I returned it to Remington for a refund. Remington was very good about honoring the terms of their warranty."
4,Superior Closeness For An Electric Razor,"I've shaved with an electric razor for years and have used Remington's for many of them. For the past 10 years I have used other brands: Braun, Wahl, and Norelco, for example.Dissatisfied with the closeness I experienced with the other brands, I purchased the Remington MS2-390. While it is a little noisy, the closeness is unsurpassed. Because it does shave so close, it may be a bit irritating for those who are first time electric users; thus, may take some getting used to. As for me, it's perfect. I recommend it highly."
1,Worst Shaver I have Ever Owned,"The only good thing is the close shave. It is VERY noisy, and worse it is so poorly made that the cutters often fell off when cleaning them. Finally a cutter fell off and the anchor broke so could not be put back. I phoned and was told to return for a replacement. They sent me the a very new Remington F-5790 which is far superior: quiet, close shave, and easy to clean. (Price is double MS2-390.) AVOID the MS2-390!"
5,jazz girl,"Peter J. , you are brilliant..Michael and Eliane Elias..very cool idea..I loved this cd..but of course anything Michael Franks does is amazing..love his music..writting..and voice..and love the fact you can listen to his albums without annoying drum machines..buy the cd..and enjoy"
3,Kind of a let-down,"I absolutely adore Michael Franks. He, Mark Murphy, and Sinatra are my ""top three."" Still, I can't help but feeling somewhat disappointed with this, his latest effort. The material feels somewhat ""thin"" to me. Barefoot on the Beach was sublime, as was Abandoned Garden before. There are some really nice moments here, but unlike Michael's earlier releases, they only occur here and there as opposed to through-out. Favorites on here include: ""Under the Sun,"" ""Rio,"" Hearing Take Five,"" and ""The Question is Why.""Michael: Please don't make us wait three years for another go-around!"
4,Very inspiring iris fold book,"I was very inspired by this book. The iris folded photos take iris folding to a whole new level. The cards are very creative and not all of them are basic rectangular shapes: an Indian style elephant card has an iris folded blanket, a Japanese lady with an iris folded parasol, and angels. Their rectangular cards great too and incorporate more than iris folding for embellishments. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 was that not all the samples had directions on how to do the cards. I also didn't like that some of the iris fold patterns given weren't numbered which is useful especially for a beginner."
2,THIS BOOK DOES NOT COME WITH PAPERS!!!,"If I had been looking at this book in the store, or if some bit of detail had been from the seller, I would not have purchased this book. I purchase books like these expecting a combination of instructions and the required special paper for the projects. The instructions are very good and detailed, but useless until I make a special trip to purchase the papers."
2,It Sucks,where's the hardcore kick ass pounding song Fury (House of the Dead). well if you all are woundering where to find it download(WinMx) it's a sharing file source and i have it downloded right here.FURY (HOUSE OF THE DEAD) (TOTAL TIME) 7:36it contains the ending version first& oh yeah the gunfight battle withthe zombies second.
1,Flat and Unfurious,"The movie, while fairly cheesy, actually works somewhat as a hardgore music video for Black Tiger's pounding song ""Fury,"" which appears twice in the film...but nowhere in the soundrack."
2,Dissapointing,"The reason i bought the soundtrack because i thought""Fury (House of The Dead"" By Black Tiger would on it.You know where they play the song in the gun fight battleand at the end credits and also thought ""Danger"" By CODETRASHERwhere they play the song from the beginning of the movie.Because ""Fury"" (House of The Dead)is the theme song to themovie, then after i found out is wasn't there it knda pissedoff a little."
2,cliches and sports anecdotes,"Wow, this one was disappointing. If you're a total newbie to sports psychology, you'll at least be introduced to the basics. But really, this book is just a collection of cute stories and cliched sports sayings."
2,"Not well written, rehashes other books.","I have just about every book on the topic of sports performance.I've read others that were more impactful and helpful.Granted, this book is good if you're just looking for some inspiration that might eventually lead you to results. For immediate results to use on one's game, however, this book isn't it!As another reviewer said, it's clumsily written. For my hard earned money, I'd like something that I can actually use on my game right away.If you're a couch potato athlete that only watches a game, this book is probably good. My brother-in-law loves it. He's never played a sport in his life, but is a big fan. For competitive athletes who are more interested in RESULTS and can get their cliches from TV announcers, this book isn't for them.I'd give it one star, but those who've met the guy seem to like him enough to log onto amazon and write a review. Nothing personal, but I can't give this anything like the rating the others did."
3,not what i expected,"a solid read, but i was expecting a book that got more into the intricacies of sports psychology, but this book seems to focus more on your thinking off the court then on it."
3,Mind Gym,"This a well written, concise look into a gammut of psychological skills related to sport performance. It is also a series of short stories from the author's career as a professional sport psychologist. It is an easy read and well done. What it is NOT is an introduction to sport psychology or a book that can help someone learn sport psychology unless they are already familiar with the topic. Good book, I liked it very much; but not a book from which one can learn sport psychology. It is a collection of stories and within each story there is a skill to be learned."
2,Cliches,I thought the book was full of useless cliches and didn't give useful ways to exercise my players and my mind to develop the mental toughness that we need.
5,Excellent Book to Help you with Mental Stress/Issues,This book was recommended to me get over issues I had playing racquetball. I kept making mental mistakes and things got worse as the match progressed. This book has taught me how to stay focus and keep moving forward. My game has improved quite a bit and I have beaten players that I have never beaten before. When things go wrong I use the techniques in this book. I highly recommend this book for anyone who needs to take the next step. This is one of those books that you will read more than once and make notes of certain chapters.
3,Good Stuff,"Pretty good book if you need some general motivation... The author knows the topic and gives some good examples, but doesn't really get into specific actions to help resolve issues. Also, alot of baseball and golf examples, I found it hard to relate it to the sports I am involved in. Tons of great quotes, etc to get you amped."
2,Mental training for the professional sports fan,"This book includes many of the basic mental concepts discussed in sports: staying positive, etc. Although there were some helpful tips, it was a task to sort through the excessive name dropping. As an athlete, I don't need to know the names of everyone the author has ever helped. I assume, since I am buying and reading the book, that I will at least somewhat trust what is being said and that I will be willing to try it myself. If you need the 150/224 pages of professional athlete anecdotes, then this book is for you. If, like most athletes, you don't have time to sit and read fluff, find another book."
4,Good read,Have since seen a this book around a lot and nobody says a bad thing about it. Not the greatest book of all time but very good. Easy reading and probably why a lot of people read more than once.
5,Great Book,This is a great book. It helps you to put the minds involved in athletics in perspective.
2,not good stuff,"i love sepulturathey kick major... ...but this album was THE lamest of them all. And to the guy that printed the first review this iz not their latest album this is one of their first. It's just too dry and young. Max said it himself "" I don't like this album, it's a very young and stupid sepultura"". I rest my case."
3,"Good stuff, terrible production.","This album is unremarkable, except for a few select tracks. However, the energy of Sepultura and the conviction behind Max's barkings that drive the band in their future works is unmistakable. Interestingly, I find that the Bestial Devastation tracks are on average better than those on Morbid Visions: MV contains a lot of ""filler"" and much of it sounds the same - in fact, much of it sounds like ""Schizophrenia"", which is better. If you are a loyal fan, then get it anyway, you'll enjoy it. If you're just curious about Sepultura, then it depends: (1) Arise is clean and fast yet ""melodious"" (2) Roots is not a speed album, but it is a creative masterpiece (3) If you want raw speed and power, find a live album. Half of Blood-Rooted is tired junk that sounds like they are trying to get over with their record contract, but the other half is a relentless wall of noise."
1,the worst album ever !!!!!,The first album of seps was a real disaster.The sound is awful and the songwriting is childish.It is horrible.Iwonder how did they sign up for an album like that.Luckily next albums were really superb.I recommend schizophrenia and beneath the remains .Stay away from morbid visions roots and against...
2,THEIR WEAKEST ALBUM.,"This is the bands weakest album because the production is horrible and the songs arent that good.They do not have a developed sound to their music at this point because they are not experienced enough playing as a band.The theme and vibe of this album is just lame and cheesy to put it blunly.However,they do make up for it on the next album.Trust me,you can pass this one up."
2,Got to start somewhere right?,"I listened to this only a couple times...It's hoorible. However, they were inexperianced, didnt have a lot of money and couldnt speak a lot of english at the time, so I dont hold it against them...if you;re a diehard fan, pick it up....if not, then pass....get Chaos AD instead"
1,"Great for laughs, not for music","I bought this CD probably 13 years ago when I was really into Sepultura, and I remember going through the songs with my friends while we laughed our butts off. None of the so-called lyrics are even remotely understandable; it is just the ""singer"" making noises trying to sound scary, which is something that should work with little kids, not adults. It also sounds like it was recorded on a walkman or something - just horrible quality production and even worse music."
4,Great trash metal album,"Hey Sepultura fans. This CD is real great one. I wish this max remixed again cause the vocals are heard too good and guitars are heard less. Troops of Doom is more slower than the live version but it's still awesome. If you see MV with Bestial Devastation bonus tracks, get it! Less money gave away."
4,Pricey...but Totally Rad.,"This little book (with a big price tag) is a SHE-RA fans absolute dream. A bible for the icon that is She-Ra. Wonderfully written, totally informative, and over-priced, all the Shera toys are presented with full color photographs, info, and price listing. Ms. DePiano clearly knows her stuff and her love for the character is happily noticed.The downfall is the price. It's a small press book (and a cool one) but the $30 is a bit steep. More pictures; multiple angles, character artwork, and cartoon comparison) would have been cool. But many of those thing probably come with a hefty price tag.A wonderful book for the She-Ra collecter/fan!!!"
5,Great travel backpack!!!,"Recently used this backpack on a two week trip to Itlay. I bought three backpacks and decideed to use this one and return the other two. Great choice. Well fitted to a woman's smaller lengh back, and front securing straps. Easy to get on and off, able to be loaded to the tippy top and carry everything. The gel straps were very comfortable. Great compartmentalization. Great fabric and color. Can't save enough. The wife of our good freinds that we traveled with was very envious of my backpack. We are all in our 60's so this isn't just for ""kids"". Made hauling our ""stuff"" around Italy more of a pleasure. Enjoy it."
5,Awesome Backpack,Can't say enough it is a perfect backpack for a college student making the treck around campus.
1,Cogently argued but fatally flawed,"Some of this book is an interesting discussion of the boundries of computability. However, the book's central claim, that you can exceed the Turing limit, requires the storing of infinitely precise variables in a physical device. This is a physical impossibility which no amount of gratuitous logical notation will make go away. Even if you put aside the difficulties of measuring a value to infinite precision, quantum indeterminance and discontinuity will not allow any physical object to store or encode an infinitely precise value in any fashion. Once this premise is seen to be false, most of the other interesting claims in the book, and all the hypercomputational ones, immediately collapse."
1,"Lots of notation, little content","This book certainly claims to give much much more than what It actually provides. Trying to read this book, you'll have to swallow a formalism that unfortunately does not pay off. There is absolutely no revolutionary idea, just well known facts and pretention to do better than a TM but based on assumptions that by their sole existence, suffice to do better than any Turing machine, you don't need a whole book to say this. (namely, working with arbitrary precision)."
4,Nice to have!,"I'm not sure if this is the absolute best wordstudy NT on the market, but I will say that it is a handy book to have.The Strong's numbers are included with the text which makes it easy to look up the corresponding Greek words. There is also a modest Greek dictionary/lexicon in the back.Zodhiates does a good job of shedding some light on those harder to understand verses. The text is KJV.I'm happy that I purchased this book. Of the books in my library, it tends to be pulled off the shelf more often than many others."
4,Great for studying the New Testament,"This is great if you want to get further into the Word. A couple negatives: first, you can almost be sure the ""reference card"" in this will be the wrong one (it'll be for the Old Testament study, mine had the wrong one, and so did every copy at my local bookstore, upon contacting the publisher, they sent me a replacement, it was the wrong one too). Second, oddly enough, there are a few times when this study help uses the Nestle's number rather than the textus receptus number. What makes this so strange is that the King James was translated from the textus receptus. Another thing that doesn't affect anything, just personal preference, this edition has ""re-spelled"" some words such as ""stedfast,"" and ""saviour,"" and they might have even put the Hebrew-equivalent of the names from the Greek, I can't remember (I hope you understood that). Otherwise, it's a great study tool. I do have to say, you can in effect get the same thing for free from onlinebible."
3,Really good customer service,"When we ordered the book we were not sure if it was the one we wanted and , sure enough, it wasn't. It IS a very good study book, just not the one we needed. Returning it was a simple thing and we got no flack from the seller or Amazon. It was all taken care of quickly and nicely. I appreciate that."
1,Does not work with Palm TX,I have discovered that using a USB cable to charge the Palm TX works only when the USB cable is connected to a computer.It does not work if the USB cable is connected to a cigarette lighter outlet or ac outlet. This is a problem that you can find discussed on the internet.So save your money and do not buy this product since it will not charge your Palm TX.
1,Naked is Right--Naked of Interest!,"The author says that this is not a beginners book, but it isn't for anyone much more advanced either. It doesn't contain anything of interest beyond the basics, as one might expect from the title and cover description. It tries to be cute about each topic, but there are few real laughs to be had. If you are looking for a some useful tricks and work-arounds try ""Windows XP Annoyances"" by David Karp. And ""Windows XP Inside out"" by Bott and Siechert is the best overall tratment I have so far found."
5,Classic Dan Gookin,I am 57 years old and got my first PC in 2001. With the help of Dan Gookin's books I can do anything I want with Windows including C Programming. His Naked Windows XP book is for theose who have mastered the basics. His material is so well presented that all a user needs to do is check the table of contents or index to locate a topic. The best part about using his books is that He backs up his work!
2,"Cute, clever, not much help","Gookin wastes so much space being clever that I guess he ran out of room for content. For instance, I have a second computer running Win 98 that I wanted to network with the XP machine. All this book has under networking is how to get connected to the Internet.Don't waste your money on this turkey, buy David Pogue's ""Windows XP The Missing Manual"" instead."
4,shoe happy momma,"Really like the look of this shoe. Kinda edgy with a classy look. I would normally wear a 9.5 in any aerosole dress shoe, but this one ran a bit large. Very unusual. Definately reordering the half size smaller. They feel comfortable enough to maybe wear all day."
2,Groan!,Ellis ignores the history of Sherman's march and proceeds on to an extended rant that focuses mainly on his adolescent hormones. The writing is weak. I finished it feeling cheated of the time I wasted looking for some substance. Leave this one alone
5,"Exciting, fun and inspirational&#65533;Read it!","Close CallsI found the book riveting, exciting and well written. I only hitchhiked twice in my life (once because I ran out of gas, and the other time to visit my girlfriend in St. Louis), but I always wanted to ""hit the road"" like Bryce Yarborough. I doubt I could have lasted 10 years--maybe 6 to 12 months.I suspected there were weird people out there, and this book captures both strange and intriguing characters.I also like the fact that the book goes beyond the true adventure stories, although that alone is worth it. His search for meaning and purpose ring true and honest, and his final discovery amazes me. He hits it right on the mark. If only we could all remember it as we live our lives.If you're looking for a fun and inspirational read, and a way to vicariously ""hit the road,"" put this one on your MUST READ list."
4,Nostalgia,Love the stories and their unique format. I remember reading the orginals in the SEP.I think the condition of the book should have been classified as fair not good. All in in all I am satisfied. Thank you! Whitey
4,Very good but slightly biased,"Here is a good reference guide for the honest historic ship modeller! I only regret the fact its coverage of portuguese ships is very incomplete and casual. It even presents a totally unreliable model of a portuguese XVI century caravel in page 203! In the sources chapter it doesn't even mention the oldest technical documents on shipbuilding in Europe: the ""Ars Nautica""(1570). However, for everyone mainly interested in ancient ships other than the portuguese it's a fairly complete reference not to be without."
2,Not Right for The Beginner Modeler,"This book is indeed packed with page after page of excellent examples and detailed drawings. It is easy to imagine how an experienced modeler would find this a very valuable resource, especially when accuracy is desired.Unfortunately, I am in the process of building my very first model ship and I was looking for a book to explain the basics of successful modeling. Ordering this book was a big mistake and I actually decided to return it for something aimed more at novices like me.Hopefully, one day I will be at the level where I will find a book like this to be a useful guide. Right now, however, I would recommend anyone new to the hobby to keep looking unless you simply enjoy looking at every conceivable variation of all the components of different ships from different nations and periods (which actually sounds like a lot of fun!). I found it to be an excellent reference, just way too advanced for me."
3,Historic Ship Models,Moderately helpful in detailing ship's construction and equipment. Unfortunately zu Mondfeld does not furnish dimensins which would make the book more helpful.
2,Poor Design - Poor Battery Life - I returned it,"Briefly put:1- The toggle switch was easily bumped, thus suddenly switching songs, etc... such as when carrying in pocket, or when running with it in the sport band. (I did not discover a way to lock these features when using)2- The battery life (it takes 1 AA battery and is not rechargeable) lasts about 2 hours before needing replacement.3- It does not remember where you were in a song, podcast, or playlist, so if you turn it off and come back, one searches to find where one was at.4- The forward search is very slow.5- The fm radio only pulls in the strongest stations in the area.After 28 days I returned it, just in time (30 days window to the store I bought it from)."
2,"Was ok, but...","Well, this was my first experience with an MP3 player, I figured I'd try them before I go for the IPOD. Maybe I should have gone all out from the beginning.I initially liked it's features. The fm tuner was nice, for when I wanted to listen to my favorite show. I also liked the stopwatch. The sound is pretty good, too.Then, things started to break. First, the battery clip broke off, but I coould still force it closed. Then one day I turned it on and all of my songs had been erased, I had to reload them, I was very annoyed.Lastly, I turned it on last week and it now reads ""boot error"" I have tried everything but nothing seems to work. I have this thing for less than three months, so this is a little frustrating.Hope this helps,EW"
1,If only it worked,"This thing has to be one of the worst mp3 players on the market. When I first got it I was satisfied, it did about what I expected. It was a little frustrating that every time it was turned on it had to update the library, taking about a minute to boot up, but something that could be tolerated. After a couple weeks it would not turn on unless the battery was taken out to reset it. It kept going down hill and eventually would not turn on at all, giving a ""Boot Error"" message.I was able to fix that by formatting it. But that was not where the frustration ended. The screen started to automatically adjust the contrast to the darkest setting making the display unreadable. If that wasn't enough it would randomly turn off.Now it is in the trash.oh and the SD expansion slot didn't work"
1,Needs usability testing,"Neat idea to combine FM radio with MP3 player; but DO NOT buy this product. Initiating the FM radio feature, it scans the band to identify a set of presets, which then you can easily navigate between (in theory, see blow). The problem: in the middle of an urban area, almost all presets identified by the scan were non-signals. The presets were 87.9, 88.1, 88.3, etc.Navigation control is very touchy. It is very difficult coax the behavior you want; FF a song, go to next song, go to previous song, pause-- might as well roll a die.I have a hard time imagining this product ever passed testing in a product usability lab."
1,Piece of junk,"This product is a piece of junk. The thing freezes almost every time I turn it on. The only thing I can do when that happens is take the battery out and put it back in. Even then, the thing just keeps on freezing when I try to play a song. Also, there are way too many unnecessary features, which makes this very confusing to use when you just want to play music. It is not at all user-friendly and the control stick hurts my fingers and is too difficult to use.If you just want a basic, intuitive MP3 player that WORKS, look elsewhere (like iPod, Sandisk, or Creative). The other reviewers are spot on. This thing belongs in a garbage can."
1,mp3,"Terrible!!! This product(the first versions) were excellent but the software sucked. Now they have the software issues resolved but the hardware sucks. It cut out as I ran, and just plain quit working. DO NOT BUY, if you want to have an mp3 player play songs that you can exercise too, this aint it!"
3,not what i had hoped for,"I was very disapointed when I heard this CD. I think that Enya, Loreena McKinnitt, Kate Price, and Maire Brennan are lots better if you want this style, even though I have heard worse>"
5,This is one of the best worship and praise albums out there.,"This is a great album. Once I start playing it I just can't turn it off. Very inspirational. I think this group of young people is really dedicated to doing the Lord's work, and I admire them for bringing the gospel to our youngsters. To Kevin and the Voices: keep up the good work! He Shall Return!!!"
3,Third Collection Of Poetry From Gladys Cardiff,"This collection of poetry is mainly based on naturalistic & Native American themes. The poems are more hit & miss than all around solid. While literariy sound, they lack in giving inspiration. Decent, but not a great work."
1,Item is not as shown,The item shown in the photo is a sunclear manufacturer. I received a UAG. The sunclear would definetly be the more expensive laser.
1,Do not buy,"Bought this laser at a gun show, it worked for about two months, then went bad, eats up batteries not worth the money.no name on the laser so I can not send a e-mail to them to tell them how much the laser sucks. I will never but another one"
1,Not Happy with this Item,the 5mw Green Laser Gun Sight SC-GL-MIL with Weaver style Rail Mount I received came with parts missing screws stripped and no instructions. The laser could not be adjusted do to the strpiped hex screws and 1 missing. The mount had 1 bad screw. The laser is basically a 70 dollar laser pointer not usable for weapons but maybe a power point session.
5,Great for older people,I just received this and it is great. I am 71 years old and it is so easy to hold. I take my GBA to the Doctors office and I will be able to store 3 games to play while I wait. It is the best thing that has come out for the Gameboy advance.
3,how am i supposed to play gameboy color games!?,"this is a stellar item to get if you are just playing gameboy advanced games on the go . but if you are like me, you would find it hard to play more than one regular gameboy games. other wise you have to get this item. the ability to switch between games is the best function. GET THIS ITEM!!"
5,Isaiah GBA Champ,So I.ve Heard About The Game Boy Advance SP Game Changer And I.ve Been Wanting To Get One For My GBA SP Classic NES Series That Way It Will Almost Feel Like I Got 3 Gameboy Advance SPS For The Price Of One See Ya Later People!!!
3,Cheap Construction,"I was looking forward to buy the changer for my gameboy advance sp. However when I got home and opened the package, the first thing I noticed was how cheaply the changer was constructed. So I tried it out. First of all the On/Off switch did not work correctly the first 3 times I tried. So I re-mounted the gameboy and tried again, success.So far, not too bad. The games in slots one and two worked fine but the switch would not click into the third position. Finally I managed to push it down far enough to get the third game to start.An additional was when I tried to shut the gameboy off. I slid the slider into the off position and nothing happened, the gameboy was still on. So I tried again, still no luck. I had to take the gameboy out of the changer to turn it off.I continued to have these same problems, so I gave up. I am going to return the changer tomorrow.On the positive side, the changer added some bulk to the gameboy, and felt a lot more comfortable to hold."
4,good but bulky and awkward,"its a nice and cool accessory for my sp's, but its really awkward. it makes the sp look and feel huge, and it stays in an awkward shape when closed. it is very very bulky, and cant even fit in my pocket. i find the game-changing a bit useless, but i wanted a good grip to use while playing at home, and this suits the need. a few complaints would be that the game in slot #2(on top) sticks out a centimeter, and is not flush as with the other two slots. another would be that the on and off switch is kind of hard to use. other than that, it works fine and is really comfortable definitely worth it."
4,Needs a little improvement,This is a great accessory to have with the gameboy. The only issue I have is that you have to turn off the gameboy to switch the game you are playing.
3,Ok....But....,"I like this little thing. It's cool. It's comfortable. It holds three Gameboy Advance games that you can switch with....but I give it 3 Stars because it cannot hold Gameboy and Gameboy Color games. Still, it's a good buy."
3,You need this for three tracks,"Yeah, hate to say this, but MOST of this material is available on Del-Fi's Cucamonga album, some of it in much better quality. But there are three tracks, ""Grunion Run"", ""Tijuana Surf"", and ""Memories of El Monte"" that are not otherwise available, and which are really only available here. But they are taken from some old singles, and while the quality is not bad, it's not up to usual spiffy Zappa standards, or cd standards in general.Think long and hard before buying this one, and perhaps find a way to listen to it first."
5,The Joy of Uncircumcising is a true gift.,This book is well written and gives the truth behind circumcision's destructive qualities. The book is very helpful for men who feel they have had something wrongfully taken from them through circumcision. I strongly recommend it to anyone who cares about his body.
1,Cultish and fringe,"It's hard to believe that an intelligent person would devote himself to stretching out what's left of men's foreskins with tape and fishing weights. This book is a cult classic -- bizarre, to say the least."
1,Waste of time,After the first few paragraphs I realized the author was preaching anti free market propaganda. The time spent reading these few sentences was a complete waste.
2,Not recommended--Use Ecker & Crook instead,"I began reading this catchy translation only to find that it omitted material which other modern renderings have and also appeared to be poorly edited. I personally would recommend reading Chaucer in the original, but if you must have a translation, try Ecker and Crook's (ISBN 0963651234) instead. It is slightly more difficult to read but is both edited properly and faithful to the original. It is also one of the few complete translations, covering all 22 poetry tales and 2 prose tales of the 24 we have (of the intended 120 of this never-completed work)."
2,No Jacket for my new book?,I ordered a new book and paid the new price. why didn't I get a book cover jacket with my new book. It shows a cover in the product description??? can you send me the complete order please. I have the book but want the jacket.Great Grand daughter of Chaucer.
3,A return to a harder edge,"With more rock included than the previous outings (Change of Heart; Boats Against the Current), Tonight you're Mine re-captures some of the grit that Eric had displayed in his initial solo release and with the Raspberries. That said, the songs are fun and jam-packed with well known session players. The ballads are still here, just more evenly distributed among the rock tunes.None of it is high art, just pop music; some songs better than others. If you are an Eric Carmen fan, and long for some of the harder edge in his music, then I suspect that you will like this album."
1,Carmen's worst album,"Since his first solo release in the mid 70's, I've remained a big fan of Eric Carmen's music and songwriting. I've purchased all of his albums and know them well. The only album of Eric's that I do not care for is ""tonight you're mine"". I'm a little puzzled by the strong reviews written by other listeners . . . . just goes to show that music is truly an individual taste. Let me simply say that if you're a fan of Eric's other albums, there's a strong chance you won't like this. There's two decent songs on this album ""all for love"" and ""it hurts too much""; but still these songs aren't great tunes."
5,Cute!,Very cute playset although the pieces were a bit smaller then they appeared on the pictures. Overall its cute and worth the money.
5,Great price...great product,"Finally a good price on Splenda at Amazon with the ability to use my Amazon Prime! My local Wal-Mart charges $12+change for this same pack, so the pricing is great on my favorite sweetener. AMAZON...IF YOU READ THESE...GET THE BROWN SUGAR AND BAKING MIX AS WELL!!!"
1,BEWARE!!!,"Splenda is POISON!!! The 2 previous reviews are spot on. Splenda (and all other ARTIFICIAL sweetners) is toxic to the human body. If you don't believe me, check out the science behind how it is made, what it REALLY contains- not the hype from the manufacturer about how its made from sugar- sugar doesn't have a nasty chemical aftertaste. Canada was the first country to allow this into the food supply and now they wonder why the have an exponential climb in the diagnosis of IBS!!! DO NOT PUT THIS IN YOUR SYSTEM!!!"
3,Where is the box??,"Item shows a box, however, my 400 were received loose inside an envelope. No way to know if there were actually 400 without counting. Won't be ordering again. I can go to an office supply store and get, in a box, for about the same price after you delete shipping."
1,Harmful to your health,"This product really should not be used for human consumption. Here is a quote from Dr. Mercola at Mercola.com to partially explain why. ""Inflammatory bowel disease--an autoimmune disease that can have serious health consequences--may be caused or exacerbated by the regular consumption of the popular artificial sweetener Splenda, as it inactivates digestive enzymes and alters gut barrier function."" There is more to learn on his site."
5,Splendid!,"What can I say. It got here fast, tastes like it should and I have no complaints. Simple solution to my problem. Awesome!"
2,Bad Taste (Rating: 5 out of 10- -2.5 stars),"My mom bought this as the alternative to sugar and loves using it all the time in her coffee. Me, I believe it's just okay, but leaves a horrible after taste. I tried using it many times, hoping I would acquire the taste, but it just didn't come at all. It even makes the coffee I drink have a weird after taste as well. Judging by the reviews, people like this stuff, me I just stick to regular sugar or Equal, because it tastes better than the Splenda."
1,"Sweet, cheap way to POISON yourself","Why would anyone put anything in there mouth, no matter how ""good"" it tasted, that had chlorine in it? Would you drink your swimming pool water?? People must be crazy!"
5,a staple,I'm a huge coffee drinker so I always use Splenda No Calorie Sweetener everytime. Makes my coffee sweet without the guilt.
3,Nice price but takes a couple hours to assemble.,Arrived in box not packed all parts were more or less just thrown in there. Thought that maybe I received a returned item but everything was there. You have to have patience and be careful when assembling.
4,Great deal and definitely beats the more expensive solar lights,I bought this set several months ago and am very happy with the end result. The light output is good and the installation was manageable. The only reason I didnt give this a 5 was because the plastic used on the lights is not the best quality.
3,Good product - poor shipping preparation,"The product is good, especially for the price; however the items were not packed at all, all components were simply ""dumped"" into the manufactor's box. As a result, two of the flood light lenses were broken and the powersupply on/off switch was damaged. The good news is that the manufacturer was OUTSTANDING (Intermatic). They had an on-line site to replace the broken parts and shipped them ASAP. I also called them regarding the powersupply and they shipped a new one ASAP. The product works great and the manufacturer is very reliable and customer oriented."
3,"Quick, Low Quality",This is a typical quick result low quality item. Don't count on it past a year. Poor construction but installs quickly so yes--the lights are nice. I have spent a little more to get a mujch higher grade==what a difference!!
3,Poor Qualiity you get what you pay for,"The lights are definately cheaply made, I was amazed they worked at all and wo ever invented had a great idea and put it to work for him. The box arrived, everything was just thrown in it, which I did not like and a few items were broken, but replaced with one phone call. The directions not great, but figured them out. I am just wondering how long they are going to hold up with weather. I would have liked something constructed a bit better, but like I said, what do you really expect at this price point. They serve our purposes and might even buy another set.Chris in Florida."
3,Malibu Intermatic Lighting,"Intermatic LX19414T Malibu Outdoor Lighting Kit with Ten Path Lights, Four FloodLights, and 60-Watt Power Pack, BlackEven for mechanically inclined person, the installation was a little tricky, but once assemble it was a breeze. Assembly instruction was vague. They were very plasticky but for the price and function can not complain."
1,Poor Excuse For Lighting,Very disappointed...barely any light output and transformer is not even powerful enough for the entire light kit.
3,Cheap quality product,Don't expect much out of the box. takes a long time to setup and not all the lamps work
1,Malibu Lights,I was very unhappy with this product....there were dozens and dozens of parts that I would have to assemble....I returned this product for full refund and plan not to purchase Malibu products again.Thank you
2,Sorry Agatha...,"I was thrilled after searching for years to find a transcript for ""spider's web"" that it was available as a novel. The thrill was soon gone. How one can manage to turn a most charming play in a bore is a mystery to me. The large print didn't help neither. You will be better off watching the movie with Glynis Johns and John Justin or the more recent BBC tv-adaption starring Penelope Keith as the perfect Clarissa."
2,A Good Play Does Not Necessarily Make a Good Novel,"This is a novelization of one of Christie's plays. Clarissa Halisham-Brown, a diplomat's wife, finds a body in her parlor while waiting for her husband to return home with an important diplomatic guest. Her efforts to hide the murder and save her husband's career become increasingly more complicated. The body is the focal point of Clarissa's efforts, and her attempts to hide it are increasingly more difficult to execute. As the story progresses, Clarissa traps herself in a web of lies.It is fully evident that this story was originally a play. All of the action takes place in one room, requiring only one set. There is no change of scenery, and only limited characters. It is less satisfying than Christie's novels. Those new to Christie's work should start with her novels. This is for the Christie fan."
2,Novelization Doesn't Work Here,"It is painfully obvious that this was originally a play, and almost certainly a charming and delightful play. Unfortunately, turning the play into a ""novel"" (and I use those quotes deliberately) was not done well at all. Every line reads as if stage directions were turned into a sentence, actors' lines had ""he said"" or ""she said"" added, and then on to the next scene. Character introductions are forced and awkward, and any back-story feels as if the character has had a page handed to him to read out loud without any practice. In short, it FEELS like a play, but a play done on the most amateur of amateur stages, with utterly lifeless direction, and an earnest desire to get through it without flubbing lines too badly. Skip this one and reread an original Christie-- or see the original play."
3,"Good story, average writing","This is a very good story, bearing Christie's trademark storytelling. However, the writing is mediocre. It was originally written as a play and was adapted into novel form by Charles Osborne. If you are looking for a typical Agatha Christie novel, pass this one up."
3,A short story made much too long,"..this would have been better as a short story. Well, it was! The main twist of the story is found in a Poirot short story, ""The Mystery of the Cheap Flat."" I'm not sure which was written first, but it worked better with Poirot. The heroine is along the lines of Tuppence. In fact, there is very little original matter in the whole story. It's still a fun read, great for killing an hour or two. I read it during my daughter's soccer practice. But I don't really recommend it unless you're just really bored. Agatha did it so much better!"
2,Oh dear...,"The Doctor is conducting repairs to the TARDIS, rendering it incapable of dematerialising, when it is pulled into a gravitational field and onto a collision course with a space freighter. Once on board, the Doctor, Romana and K9 discover that it is carrying a cargo of young people and the ore Hymetusite from Aneth to Skonnos as a tribute. But there is something secret happening on Skonnos...'The Horns of Nimon' is probably the worst Doctor Who story ever featuring Tom Baker in the title role. It features a retelling of the Greek myth of Theseus and the Minotaur (including the appearance of the Nimon), and doesn't do it in an entertaining way. With this novelisation, we are spared some of the poorer effects that were on display on TV, but the story is so poor that nothing could save it."
1,An exercise in frustration,"The reviews sounded so upbeat. Lots of examples that work easily. Unfortunately the examples don't work. This is readily apparent in the first few chapters.Visiting the book site at mozdev.org confirms that it is not just me. A multitude of readers complain that even the authors' Examples download is riddled with errors. Many readers offer some good suggestions there, although most sound extremely frustrated.But there are no words of encouragement from the authors. I emailed them at the O'Reilly site, and one replied by suggesting that I search the web for help.Too bad because I love Mozilla and have been looking forward to this book for a long time."
4,I found this book well worth having,"This was the first Mozilla XUL book that I read; I now have Nigel McFarlane's book as well. I find it useful to have more than one reference book as I can often find things in one that are not in the other.I found this book quick and easy to read and a good introduction whilst also going into sufficent detail.Importantly for me it contains information on how to go about creating a remote application to run over the Internet and using serverside PHP, neither of which have I seen mentioned elsewhere.The book is not perfect but it is useful and I think some of the other reviewers have been unduly harsh; I am glad that I was not put off."
1,This technology not ready.,"One of the first big examples is proof that this technology isn't quite ready for prime-time. Several users report problems with the examples working once and then on a second try, literally seconds later, the example does not work.For this reason, I would recommend waiting until this technology has stablized a bit more before purchasing this book."
2,BORING,"Being familar with Lustmord's more noted work, I was quite surprised by the lack of creativity on this CD! Sounds are very repetative and mundane. It didn't seem to go anywhere. Perhaps Lustmored was having a hard time bringing his unique creative processes to bear on this project. I won't write him off for this one Cd but I have to say I was dissapointed."
4,Great Book for training,"This book have all the information you need for have a good training you can choose whatever your condition, there are very goods training plans for everyone, this book do not have 5 stars,because i did not found any measure to see my performance, i mean time, so if i run 10 km in 30min. or 40min. or 1 hour, i would like to receive a status of my training."
1,Useless on the Kindle,"This seems like a great book and I only wish I bought the hard copy. The training schedules make up the majority of the book. The schedules are in table format and are NOT displaying correctly on the Kindle. The messed up display on the kindle is incredibly frustrating and renders the book unusable as you cannot decipher which workout codes go with what days. I am training for an olympic tri and was thrilled to get on a set training schedule. Now, I just feel ripped off. This should never have been offered under the Kindle edition and I am very upset that amazon and the publisher would allow this to happen. Paying $10 is not a lot, but its more than I am comfortable throwing away for nothing. If you want this book DO NOT BUY IT ON THE KINDLE!"
5,Excellent guide to triathlete training,"I'm new to the world of triathlons, and this book is fantastic. It tells you exactly what to do everyday in terms of training. It makes me feel like I've got a lot of structure in my weekly workout routine. Highly recommended to anyone that likes having a professional tell them what to do in their workouts, instead of trying to figure it out on their own."
5,must have for all x-box owners,"I just got an x-box last night with star wars: knights of the old republic. the system is great and the game is addicting. but I had an itch for something more. I went out and purchased x-box live (w/12 month subscription and crimson skies) and star wars battlefront. this is just to get me ready for the arrival of halo 2. it's great being able to play with so many other gamers from all around the world. no more having to have a friend come over to play multi-player. now I have multiplayer at my disposal at any given time. if you have an x-box and enjoy multiplayer games, this is a must for you. also, the price was great with all the other components that come along with it (game, headset, card)."
5,Brings a new dimension and challenge to gaming,"I bought XBox Live 3 weeks ago and have stopped playing my PS2 all together. The challenge of fighting or racing a real opponent is addictive.This is an ABSOLUTE MUST for anyone with broadband and an XBox.128kbs Upload speed is required to play smoothly, and if you can play people geographically close to you it will run much smoother.Buy it now, it's cheaper than a game!!!"
5,must get it!!!!!,"Oh my god!!! i have been wanting xbox live now for some time, but had never played it. well i just played it at my friend's house and it is great!!! 10 thumbs up!!! I must get this!!! But mostly because Halo 2 was really fun!"
1,kid's reveiw,I got this starter kit about two days ago and found out that there was no 12 month starter kit in it. What's the point of getting a starter kit if you cant even play with it?1? The package was sent saying there was no 12 month starter kit in it with an arrow pointed to it. DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU ALREADY HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION CARD!!!
1,Steer clear of Microsoft,The problem with the XBox in general is that there are no great games; and the problem with these XBox Live Starter Kits is they rope you into an auto-renewal program and will not let you cancel easily. I had to pay for an entire year extra even though I had only used the service once the day I bought it. Microsoft is unwavering in its corporate policies. Typical arrogance from a company so out of touch with consumers they've forgotten the concept of good customer relations. I'll never do business with Microsoft again -- not that I ever had except for my drunken affair with the XBox. What a bad hangover this is turning out to be.
5,A must have video for John Denver fans!!,"This is a powerful video from John Denver. It gives great insight to the things that were important to him, and the things he tried to change and honor in the world through his music.I had no idea that he was almost on the Spaceship Challenger--I did know that flying and going up in space were important to him--and he honors NASA and Challenger through song and video on this DVD.""Ravens child"", and the video, will take on new meaning as a song about the greed and arrogance of drug lords and corporations both, and ""Let us begin"" (What are we making weapons for), and the accompaning video, is what he considers his most important work. A beautiful and powerful DVD."
3,A Portrait,"As always, its a delight seeing John up and about, knowing he is gone, but this is not my favorite VHS. It is okay tho. Sorta like a personal visit with him at one place he enjoys being at. Not long enough tho. Wish they had a video with nothing but him talking and enjoying himself, like a home movie type of thing. Anyhow I am glad I have it now and will keep it as I will all the others I have purchased of him too. He surely was some fella, and very few like him come into our lives like he did. So glad his grandma gave him a guitar. If he didn't become a singer, how much we would all have lost out on."
1,Terrible Quality,"Although I continue to adore John Denver - i cannot give this dvd any review as i cannot watch it. From beginning to end it is completely unintelligible - breaking up constantly. I would love to recommend ""John Denver/A Self Portrait,"" but simply cannot."
1,This keyboard is crap.,"Our company mistakenly purchased 6 of these keyboards, and of those 6, only 1 actually works (which we will not use given the other 5 failures). These keyboards are total garbage. I urge anyone reading this to NOT PURCHASE THESE ITEMS or anything else by this company. Any company that attempts to sell items where 5 out of 6 are completely unusable isn't worth your business."
5,Must-read for Mary Kay Beauty Consultants,"Part of Mary Kay's company philosophy is to ""enrich women's lives"", and this book can help you see how to be successful exactly by enriching others! The 4.5 steps are: Attitude, Rapport, the Process Inquiry, Presentation, and the Close. I dont see the table of contents on this detail page yet, so I'll give it to you: Ch1-Understanding Responsibility, Mission, and Response-Ability. Ch2-Building Rapport with Potential Clients. Ch3-Using the Super Theory or Relate-tivity. Ch4 -Harnessing the Power of Inquiry. Ch5-Creating a Successful Presentation. Ch6-Recognizing the Close--Just Reconfirm and Ask ""When"". Ch7-Overcoming Obstacles to Success. Ch8-Prospecting. Ch9-Everybody Hates Making Cold Calls. Ch10-Learning Super's Secrets of Sales Tool Maintenance. Ch11-Lagniappe.These are things we all hear at unit meetings, but the author brings fresh perspective and practical support to them. A fast and fabulous read."
4,Nostalgia,The asking is the fun part to see if anyone knows what this is. Most don't remember the ugly Batman and Robin from before the 60s...Vintage and fun
1,Flimsy,I bought this with my razr v3xx phone. It didn't last a week. The two thin strips connecting the front and back tore off in no time. Don't buy it.
1,motorola v3xx,don't waste your money on this one. The fit was such that you had to remove the case to use your phone. And the case broke within the first two weeks of use.
4,The Legend of the Bat,"This story begins just a few weeks before Miller's Batman: Year One. The two stories begin as a linked entity, the split into separate directions.As a young Bruce Wayne that is not yet Batman tracks a killer in Alaska, he is nearly killed himself. Brought back to life by an Alaskan Shaman with a story of the Bat, Bruce is saved. He returns to his native Gotham to find the town plagued by a mysterious serial killer, taking lives in the name of Chubala, a religion of South Africa.To complicate things further, a museum is broken into a several relics of the tribe that saved Bruce Wayne are stolen. People linked with the tribe are dying, being murdered by some mysterious foe that wears the mask of the bat.A newly created Batman must learn what the Legend of the Bat from Alaska has to do with an African religion and a glut of murder and drugs in Gotham.This graphic reprints Legends of the Batman #1-5. A solid addition to any Batman collection."
5,"Smart, suspenseful","Batman's beginnings--he received a message from beyond in the form of a bat and thereby became the Batman. This story is written excellently and the man behind the cowl came alive as I read this tale. One of the most dramatic parts is where Batman, directly in the face of a frightened thug, declares menacingly,""The streets belong to The Batman."" If anyone wants to see Batman in true form, you must read this book."
3,It was a'right,"This was an unusual tale about a man who is married to an abusive woman and who has an affair. When the evil wife discovers this, she writes a letter to his lover's husband which causes the irate man to shoot his wife and then himself. Distraught at the death of his lover, Abel flees with his young son. Eventually, he finds himself working for an elderly businessman, and embroils himself in a love triangle between the businessman's widow and the widow's sister.In general I liked Cookson's work, but the hero in this one was just sort of bland. His facial expressions were very dour and I wish he'd taken the bull by its horns and divorced his nasty ex. His successive relationships and the love triangle, I was rather meh about. I did like his young son, and his relationship with the girl next door was rather cute. Overall I thought this was an average film, worth watching, but it didn't excite me."
3,Fun Figures,"We purchased this set for my 4 year old son for his birthday. The sole purpose was to replace his original die cast tractor that had been crushed when stepped on by an adult. These are fairly sturdy die cast metal toys and he has great fun acting out the scenes from the CARS movie. However, I wish Disney would provide an option to purchase just the tractor as they do with most of the other figurines."
4,Son Loved It,These two cars are probably the most popular so I got these for my boy after he watched the movie. He was sqealing with delight. He tried to actually use Mater to tow Lightning but that didn't work to well. He had fun trying to get Lighnting to stay on there though! It just isn't made for that. The cars had nice realistic paint jobs and were pretty heavy so I was satisfied.
4,not really a book for guys...but hilarious for girls,"i liked this. it was funny and there were lots of true-life moments in it, especially the parts about what kind of dog he was/is."
5,"Great westerns, good set","This set gives me all the Clint Eastwood ""man with no name"" movies I could ever want, even comes with Hang em high. For me, this is a great set."
3,Factory Burning Marginal Quality At Times,"Being a fan of both Dirty Harry and Walt Kolowski, I thought it was time to get acquainted with some of Clint's original characters. I was pleased to see they had a 4 pack for such a decent price, including the Man With No Name trilogy and the classic Hang 'Em High.The movies are pretty good with the old-fashioned plot lines and acting. If you're a typical modern day kid there might not be enough special effects/""strong"" women (feminists)/girly men with cheese-filled muscles, etc. for you to enjoy.However I can only give the set 3 stars because of technical blandness. In more than one of the films the audio and video dont seem to quite match in timing. It's close but several frames off most of the time. (However it always seemed to match up when Eastwood was talking ha).I guess you get what you pay for, and for a 20-something dude who likes to save his money, and is content playing a classic film on an old non-HD television it's a worth-while buy."
5,Good Quality Classic,great classic love Clint Eastwood. Will buy more in the future. Dirty Harry or every which way or maybe a package!
2,Really Bad Sound,"The sound on this dvd set is really bad. I mean ""turn on your old AM radio bad"". You can't even enjoy the soundtrack music.The other reviews about no labels and discs not being set up for big screen tv's should be considered also as they are correct. These issues together with the bad sound quality really let you know why this disc set is so cheap. Yes you get the movies but I will probably only watch them once because the quality is so bad.Definitely coaster material."
1,No DVD case!,"Products look good, but it always leaves me pissed when they don't include the DVD case. The envelopes are nonsense. Thanks, buddy."
5,Just what I expected,"My shipment was received on time and in perfect condition. It is great to have the classic Clint Eastwood ""Spaghetti Westerns on DVD. It has brought back memories of spending Saturday afternoons in our local cinema or"" ""the show"" as we called as kids and acting out the movies on our way home. I highly recommend this package to anyone who wants to enjoy these memories."
3,The Real Bucks County,"I live in Bucks County & this is a pulp fiction version of it. The towns in the book are New Hope & lambertville NJ, thinly disguised.I think the characters were created after real people also but quite a bit before my time.It's a hoot...a good look back at what was once considered shameful!"
4,Story description:,"Elizabeth Stevens knew she had been lucky to obtain a position with the wealthy Earl of Chesham at Stormhaven. She was awed by the magnificence of the manor house, and even more so by the master himself-the dark brooding Derek VanderworthBut it was his golden-haired daughter, Amy, who attracted Elizabeth's attention with her sad, sorrowful eyes. The little girl had not spoken since her mother's death a year ago, and Elizabeth was determined to befriend her and discover more about the tragic past...even if it meant braving the fierce resistance of the arrogant Earl.Mysterious crying in the night and strange noises from the fourth floor had aroused Elizabeth's suspicions and her fear. There was a madness lurking in the shadows of Stormhaven, and Elizabeth wondered if the ghostly screams she heard might soon be her own."
3,"um, not quite a complaint, but still","I haven't tested these yet, but the picture shows one valve extension. I ordered four extensionsand received four sets of four extensions. I suppose I should be happy that I received four times what I expected for the same price, but I would have preferred to save the $5 or so for the unnecessary three sets.- EDIT October 2012When I sold the car, a few months after having installed these valve extensions, they had already begun to rust. The short life of these devices suggests a 2-star rating would be in order."
5,"Awesome concept, brilliant artistry!!!","This is one of the coolest things I've ever come by. The psychotic stories of Clive Barker transferred to the graphic novel format. Some of the very best Barker tales are chosen for this collection. The artwork completely captures every aspect of the disturbing yet poetic brilliance of Barker's stories. Bravo! A little spendy, but worth every penny. Trust me! As a die-hard Barker fan, I can say that any admirer, passive or devoted, will love this collection."
3,"interesting case study in sociology, not Korean culture","this book is not for someone who would be interested into a systematic and quick introduction to Korean wedding customs.The elements presented are of the case study type, showing the evolutions over time of a Korean family sampled for a PhD thesis. interesting for another scholarly work, it isn't so much for someone interested in understanding Korean marriage customs. Bits and pieces can be collected and summarised by oneself. This book is about ""sociology"", not ""culture"" per se."
2,Not my cup of tea,"Just as a previous reviewer commented: The most boring book of an interesting class. This required reading with antropology as its main focus, seemed to creep along. I could not keep it up. As a required reading, I had to get through it, but it was not an easy task. Ordinarily I can find something redeeming in almost all books, but this just wasn't my cup of tea.The 1980s forward became western style marriages in wedding houses like a cheap Vegas ritual. In, out and quickly leave. That was truly sad. I hoped the old eastern traditions were still in place.Other sections of the book went through details of wedding rituals done before 1980, using example weddings the author observed, while doing a dissertation project.I did not enjoy this book."
1,A true disappointment,"I own an entire collection of books about West Point. I was excited to see this book and purchased it. I have bought countless books from Amazon, some great, some good and some not so good. This book was the only book I've ever bothered to actually return.The writing is at maybe an elementary school level. There is no plot line that can be followed. The editing is poor and the illustrations are juvenile. I was so incredibly disappointed in this book, especially after seeing all of the high ratings and reviews. It is interesting to note that the reviews that are glowing are all anonymous and one must wonder about who is posting them.If you want to read about West Point, pick up ""The Long Grey Line"" or ""Duty, Honor, Country"" or ""Duty First."""
2,A Disappointment,"I expected to really enjoy this book due to its inherently fascinating subject, but was surprised by what I found. The book takes an unorthodox approach to recounting the history of Western political philosophy, back to the Greeks and Romans up through U.S. colonial times, Thomas Jefferson and the founding of West Point. While its unique format might appeal to many readers, I personally found the writing style (LOTS OF CAPITALS AND PUNCTUATION!!!!), amateurishly-drawn cartoons and lack of professional editing to detract from the extensive research undertaken to produce this work. The author obviously has a passion for his topic, but I personally did not find the result a particularly enjoyable read."
1,An odd way to write a paean...,"If one did not know better, you would have to say this is a true post-modern book--complete with cartoons, imaginary characters, imaginary scenes--played off as both history and commentary. It is really an odd book.The book reflects the author's deep love for West Point and character education of military life. Uncritical and glorifying, the author's love touches the reader, but he adds little to our understanding of the history, tradition, or educational methods of West Point."
4,Interesting Title,"Honestly, I picked up the book because the title really interested me. I began to read it and was about to put it down until I discovered the main character Rosalind was going vegetarian (since I am a vegetarian I felt I could relate). I am so glad that I didn't put this book down! It is a very fast read, and the format through e-mails and such make it more interesting. I was only upset because there were a lot of untied ends that had me screaming ""What about ---?"" or ""what happened between ---- and ----?"" I felt like the book could have been a little bit longer, and the ending was only the climax, not the resolution. Maybe a sequel will come out??"
5,Marilyn Mason has done it again!,"Like all of her books,Igniting the Spirit at Work, is a work of emmense inspiration and wisdom. She has created daily reflections to remind us of who we REALLY are, why we are HERE and WHAT we are to do with our lives. I bought this book last night after hearing her book reading, now I know what I'll be giving for gifts this holiday season to my colleagues & clients!!!"
1,Incredible Amount of Incompetence,"Show portrays outdated techniques. He, along with other vets in his practice, have been suspended because of negligence and incompetence because of what is portrayed on this show. Shame on you NationalGeo!"
5,For people in Transition,"I've known Giovanni Livera for a decade and have worked with him in many public and private assignments. He is one of the most unique and delightful people ever born! The guy is a dynamo of brilliant and energetic joy. He is an avid student of success and a master storyteller.Buy this book for anyone whose life is in transition right now. If they are changing jobs, roles, lifestyle, or reaching a major life milestone; this is the book for them. And be sure to contact [...] to get the Documents that bring this book to life for you. The documents are where the application takes place. These are works of visual art as well. I challenge you to find a set of learning tools that even approaches the beauty and sophistication of this one! And it's FUN!!!!Gio's joy will rub off on you. You will LOVE this book!!!"
5,wonderful book,"I saw Gio in a company staff assembly and was astonished by his level of energy and the wonderful magic tricks he performed, I borrowed the book from the company library and read it in a day! I could not put it down. I want to read it again and again until it is edged in my mind. I am purchasing a copy for my father as a gift for father's day. What daughter wouldn't want his daddy to live a thousand years!"
4,Inspiring book for an afternoon read,"I read this and then sent for 4 more to give away. It is a short, well written but inspiring book about time and how we spend it."
5,Great!,"I bought this set for a friend of mine for their birthday. It was in excellent condition, arrived a lot faster than I thought it would and they were so excited to receive them!!"
5,Home Sweet Home,"I can't begin to tell you how homesick these movies always make me, however, it's a great period piece and historically a time in Australia that was undergoing changes. I think that this series is very enjoyable for a relaxing ""look back"""
5,Man from Snowy River Movies,"I love these movies, I can watch them over and over again (just like a little kid!!!) Makes you want to get out and saddle the horses up for a ride. Whoever is really riding that horse really knows how to ride!!! It's a great movie to watch with any age, there is no scenes that make you want to fast forward past so the kids don't see. Very nice wholesome movies."
4,Family,"While I haven't opened this DVD yet, I know I'll love the movie because I saw it not too long ago. It is a good family movie with not too much violence and no sex. It's an old western and I enjoyed it."
1,The Man From Snowy River & Return To Snowy River 2 Pack,"I ordered this set in a hurry one evening. When I saw it was the two movies together, I assumed it would come in a slip case as a set. I was very disappointed when it wasn't. It is one of my favorite movies and I wanted it special. I also needed it in wide screen. The two pack was full screen which I could read through the unopened celophane package. I wish they would come out with this one on Blu Ray. Needless to say I did return it disappointed and unopened. My fault."
3,A Fun Read,I have read the book and it is by no means my favorite work of literature - it is a descent telling of a fantasy fiction action adventure that is not to be taken too seriously
4,Rather interesting,"This book was a very good first novel by newcomer Jonathan Bruce. I very much enjoyed the action, though the killing did start as early as page 9. The only thing I found offensive in this novel was the reference to some Christian groups as terrorists, though it seems quite self-evident that Mr. Bruce is merely striking out against extremist organization.Kudos to you, Mr. Bruce, keep writing."
5,Fresh approach to getting more from life,"Too often I find myself actually believing that all the noise of life is real. Finding the perspective to step back and focus on that which is truly important is much harder than it should be.Ms. Hughes' approach of devoting just 2% of one's time to one's true passion seems too simple to to work. However, I'm inspired to give it a trial.Deep insight into finding and following life's passion coupled with a readable style and engaging anecodotes make this a must read for anyone searching for calm and direction.I'm looking forward to Ms. Hughes' next work!"
2,Not so useful,"I'm not sure what this book is good for. It's a summary, obviously, but it is a bit wordy and misses a lot of fundamental concepts and formuli. I would have been better off buying a good used physics textbook."
4,Good value book,"This is a great little book. It's an excellent intro-to- Chile book. If you only want a short, easy to read, interesting book about Chile, this is it."
5,NFL2K Who ???,I have not played the game yet . I have seen videos of the ESPN football game and Madden . Madden has it all over them . I like you can build your own stadium . Looks like Madden has done it again !!!
3,this game has good ghapics but the game sucks,the game sucks because you can put any cheats and the guy mostly grops the balls and the people mostly get geared then earthere have to throw it away are run it and bearly get any yards or get sack so don/t buy this game till it cost $15.00 bucks
3,Not worth the money,"If you are a die-hard Madden fan and use every single new feature, it may be worth buying, but Madden 2004 is too similar to Madden 2003 to justify buying. If you don't own any Madden games, then Madden 2004 is a must, but if you already own Madden 2003 save your money and wait until Madden comes out with a game that is a true improvement. The Madden football series is excellent, and I give it 5 stars. However, the improvement from Madden 2003 to Madden 2004 is extremely dissapointing, and for that I give it 1 star (3 star average). Updating the roster, adding some new features, and putting the words 2004 on the cover does not justify charging people money."
4,The best football game ever,"This game is the best football game ever by far.It's totally worth the money.Its got sweet graphics,great extras,and the best gameplay.If you like football games,then this game is a must."
5,The Dynamic Laws of Prayer,I bought this book for a friend who is familiar with the author. She loves it and says it contains the secrets to a happy life.
1,I'm bookless and can't rate it till I get it.,"I haven't gotten my book yet -- ""The Dynamic Laws of Prayer."" Please have the company call me who is suppose to deliver my book. Thank you. I'll have to rate it again since you don't have an option to opt out of rating if one does not have the product."
2,Failed to hold my interest,"I skimmed this book in about an hour. It never led me to slow down and read it with more attention. The characters were not particularly interesting. However, it was largely inoffensive, not appalling, just not absorbing."
5,Humorous yet informative,"""Who In Hell"" is guide to the authors point of view of who he thinks is in hell. It contains 4 presidents and few of the popes and many celebrities and serial killers. Each person has a little bio on them on why exactly they went to hell. Not only is all of the bio's humorous but at the same time they are very informative as well and explains some facts that I had no idea about.""Who in Hell"" is not just limited to humans though, it has every demon supposably known to be listed in this book and their bio explains what evil each demon does.I laughed at many of the readings in this book but I also learned a lot as well. I mean seriously did you actually think Walt Disney went to hell?? Well according to this book he did!! So did Julius Ceaser!!"
2,oldie,Not as useful as the Amateur Fish Culture by Charles Edward Walker. These are old reprints books and some pompous old guy with too much time on his hands filled too many pages with not much information.
4,Cleaning is a lot easier,This brush is well made and makes it easier to clean the bath tub. It is everything that was described.I deducted 1 star because it took longer to ship from the seller than I had anticipated.
5,WONDERFUL story,"Even though the story is rather long (it takes me about 30 minutes to read it aloud cover to cover), it keeps our children fully engaged, and the illustrations are absolutely fantastic. This is one of those books we will always keep and pass on from one generation to the next."
4,Searching for good poetry?,"The poetry of José Alejandro Peña is deep but very clear. When you read a book, you searching for another vision about of reality: a zone in that the word rise to you at something like the perfection, and the world [natural or man-made] be nearest at the it-selft/elevated. In the Peña's Poetry, you gonna find that. All that... and maybe something more.Pedro Antonio Valdez"
5,Roll Tide Roll !!!!!,"This book is for anybody who loves football. It doesn't matter if you're not an University of Alabama fan. You'll still love this book. You can't stop reading it just because you think it's ""boring"". You'll love it by the time you're done. Reason being it doesn't just talk about football it talks about the people playing the football.Trust me you'll love this book."
2,Wilt stop,It is hard to tell if this stuff is actually working or not but I couldn't even use it on the new Dwarf Japanese Maple I bought it for since it says not to on the label. I used it on some other plants like my five new Blue Spruce trees and the label warned it may turn them green. It turned them a kind of sickly green color and I will not use it on them again. I dripped some on my deck rail while mixing it and it stained it a white color that has not gone awat in a few months. I won't buy this product again.
3,"How Unseemly that Alanna Nash comments on ""Monster""","Alanna Nash, author of 'Golden Girl', a book peripherally related to Dunne's 'Monster', seems to be attempting to ride the coat-tails of this camisole of a book. How unseemly."
4,Works on Windows 8!!!,"Bought this because my Windows Vista computer died and had this program since I had XP back in 2003. The case was sealed but surprisingly the DVD case was broken at the ends which worried me a bit, but when I installed it, there were no issues. Of course the compatibility screen popped up, but it continued to install with no issues and even was compatible with my old artwork from my XP days. This has a lot or vector art, which the newer versions simply don't have anymore. If you just need simple art you can adjust, change colors, and use, this is a nice program & I'm just glad it works on Windows 8. The shipping did take a little too long, however (10 Days) but I'm happy now!"
2,For school projects,"I purchase this Item for another purpose....and there was nothing exciting. I found it frustrating to use, but that was my experience or lack of it.Lesson to be learnt: I have found from buying a few similar items_ the more clip art, the more junk you have to sort through."
2,"Charts, charts, charts...but what's up?","This book talks about statistical approach to horse racing by evaluating the frequency and return of each type of bets. However, the explanations of those statistical findings are not enough. I believe if the statistical finding tells you something, we should still need to understand the rationale behind and why statistical finding comes out like this.The second half of this book is all charts in resepct of findings from different race tracks in the US, which however need readers to digest and evaluate what's inside. There is even no explanation of why the charts look in this way. In other words, half of this book only contains a presentation of data without really goes deep to analyse what's happening. This book is not good enough."
2,The Problem with statistics,"In grad school I learned that there was a statistically close correlation between teachers' salaries and alcohol consumption in the US. Unfortunately, there is no ""causal"" relationship between these two sets of data. So, close correlation or not, the relationship is meaningless. That's the problem with this book, there's lots of data, but little in the way of interpretation to help you believe the data enough to put your money on it."
3,A Few Gems & A Few Stones,"[...]A Statistical Approach to Betting the Horse Races contains data and analysis for approximately 4,000 races of data to a pre-existing (earlier edition) of about 4,000 races. The style of typeset and charting appears amateurish. The book contains a handful of excellent insights. However, there are also a few errors (such as win probabilities must be corrected to reflect take-out before they will equal one.). This book will appeal to player's following ""impact value"" type approaches for specific tracks. Every handicapper should own a book like this and I think this is a good book, however (based on my own datasets) I also think the datasets are too small to be conclusive, although the author discloses a tool for calculating standard deviation associated with these data sets."
2,Statistics Lacking,"While the book is informative the author fails to include Belmont Park and Pimlico Race Track in the study. This to me is a grievous error by leaving out a large number of knowlegable bettors. I've since worked out my own system to as near flawless as you can get, and would only take a one-page book to write down."
1,Not recommended,"After about 2 years of use, half of the touch functions stopped working. Now I can no longer set the time or alarm (crystal failure). Based on ultra poor Tissot customer service and stratospheric cost of repair, this product is not recommended."
2,Over priced for the service received ....... Would NEVER buy another t-touch,Received this watch as a gift from my daughter about 4 years ago. It looks good and worked great for almost all that time. Now as a few other owners I'm having trouble with the touch function. I want it to be known that the watch was worn very little never wet and always kept in a case. I have 25+ watches so I don't ware any of them very much. The T-touch is the only one of my watches that I have had trouble with that cost so much to repair. I had a problem with one of my Fossil watches and sent it back to the factory and it cost me $8.00 shipping.... Needless to say I'll not own another Tissot T-touch ever....... I know if I was part of management in that company follow up service would change........
1,"Fool me once, shame on me...",Add my name to the long and growing list of dissatisfied Tissot customers. I spent $600 on a T-Touch that died this year. Tissot says it no longer supports the T Touch (its been less than 9 years since I purchased it!). I will never buy another Tissot/Swatch product!
2,Great concept-- wish it worked,"As soon as the 1-year warranty on my T-Touch was over, the watch started malfunctioning. The touch screen would work intermittently, some functions were not accessible. Then it stopped working alltogether. I assumed it was a battery issue, changed it and still it did not work. I put the watch away for a while, not wanting to throw good money after bad. Miraculously the watch resuscitated itself after 8 months or so. The second coming of the T-Touch lasted about a year and then it started going through the same routine. I am looking into the Casio, but still wish it would work."
1,Una farsa,"Simplemente el reloj no lo puedes mojar, incluso con el sudor corporal basta para arruinarlo!!! El reloj puede aparentar tener varias funciones pero con el tiempo todas van fallando una tras otra... Es el peor reloj que he comprado."
1,it isn't working,"The watch stops. It isn't working.I need to know if you can change it or repair it, in this case I need official site in VenezuelaYou can comunicate with me bynorangelanzola@cantv.netnanzola383@gmail.com+404-509.3718+58-251-2543890I wait for the information, thanksNorangel Anzola"
5,Tissot T-Touch,"The watch arrived within 24 hours of placing the order, this was excellent, the quality is great. I will recommend this seller for sure. great!!!!"
1,"Great watch, Horrible Tissot service","I couldn't find a way to give less than 1 star for this or I would have. I have no complaints about the watch itself; it looks great and works well. The problems start when the batteries run out - which takes about a couple of years. I took my watch to an authorized dealer in IL to get the batteries changed and found out that the watch has to be shipped out to the manufacturer (Tissot) someplace in California. This was way back in August - I followed up with the IL dealer almost every week for 4 months and got absolutely no response about the status. The dealer tells me that it is hard to get a ""person"" to talk to at Tissot - they only respond by email !Well its mid Nov now and I have just been told by the dealer that Tissot finally responded and I should get my watch back in another week. So that is about 4 1/2 months to get the batteries changed. This is the last Tissot watch I am buying"
2,not for the 'real' outdoors person,"i bought mine at a jewlry store and was glad i did because of the problems ive had. it has been back for repair 3 times each time for more then a month. finally this last time the store insisted on new internal parts, i sure hope they did this. if you spend time outdoors i do long distance biking this watch is one you should avoid, its strictly for the wannabee outdoorsman one that looks the part but doesnt actually get stinky. the first repair the compass was bad the second was the analog hands stopped spinning and the third would not sync meaning the analog and digital times were different. get a sunto or a timex or something if you really do go outside. i give it 2 stars cuz of the cool name otherwise it would be less."
1,Not even worth the bandwidth it takes to download,"I ordered and downloaded this e-book and found it totally worthless.....not even enough to qualify as an article in a trading magazine....a page of ""gee I found this helpful"" and a few charts without text. No context, no indicator settings, no caveats.I've read many books and magazines on various forms of technical analysis and was interested in ADX. This one was not worth the bandwidth it took up...kind of like ordering a muffin and getting only a raisin.It's the first time after many years and $1000's of stuff purchased on Amazon that I've ever asked for a refund."
2,Very Weak!,"I'm being very generous by giving this trio of albums a 2 star rating. This is a 3rd rate imitation British Invasion Band somewhere in between the Zombies and the Kinks. Their material does not reach any where near the heights pioneered by such Dutch bands as the Outsiders, Motions, Groupe 1850, Q65, and RO-D-Y'S. The first two albums have the edge when compared to the last, more psychedelic album which is quite awful. The singles are by far and away the best material on this set of limp material, which bridges the beat and psychedelic eras respectively. Sound Of A Screaming Day, Daddy Buy Me a Girl, That Day, and Please Go are the best songs on this double disc set and all I believe were decent size Dutch hits. These songs remind me of a slightly tougher Hollies or a less innovative Zombies-like band. Avoid this generic set at all cost and look into buying a Small Faces, Action, Q65, Pretty Things or Outsiders album!"
2,Rather boring.....,"I can only speak for myself, but I was disappointed. I don't want to be critical, but my impression of Tracks #1, #2, #3, #5, and #6 is that Mr. Rhodes is going up and down in fluffy arpeggios on an electric piano. They all sound the same. Little creativity, no profundity, drama, or mystic quality. I only liked Track #2 and Track #7 (no electric piano) of the whole seven. I dunno.... Everybody's taste is different. Maybe you'll like it."
5,Very relaxing. Great for meditation!,"I lost my original CD of this music, and have purchased a second copy. I used this music for my first attempts at meditation. I found it so relaxing and ""free-ing."" Very inspiring."
4,Good Customer Support,"This looks like it's built like a tank with its cast iron base and copper tubed. But inside it is plastic. So mine worked great for two years of light use, but a gear finally give it up.I emailed the company and they sent out a new one for S-H or $8 or 9. I thought that was outstanding product support."
1,Not Worth the Price,Bought this bellows as a gift and initially it worked very well and my brother-in-law was very pleased. The next time I questioned him about it he said it had broken and he tried to fix it but with all plastic parts he was unable to do so. I felt bad and decided this product was definitely not worth the money I paid for it.
2,"great for a while, then broke","We used this for a couple dozen fires and charcoal grilling sessions, then the little handle broke off. It was great while it worked, but really bummed they use some cheap pot metal that fails quickly for the crank handle."
1,Broke after 10 uses,I bought the executive thinking it looked like a higher end product from the plastic one. It worked very well until it broke! I didn't even get through one winter with it! Not worth the money until they design it better.
3,painfully slow,This movie is somewhat interesting but takes way too long to get anywhere. It wasn't worth the time I wasted watching it until the end.
4,nice flares,Overall a good set of flares. They are a bit of a pain to install but look nice and covered up a lot of rust that I had on my truck. The only con is the finish is pretty easy to scratch. I would have preferred a more durable textured finished especially for the price.
5,sandals,These are really nice sandals. Very cute. Would like to buy another pair in a differant color.
4,Not as bad as people say,"This game should be worth about 4$. Basically if your a solo gamer, the only thing you can do is play 3 mini games to get coins that you use to buy accessories for your avatar and/or some music and backgrounds.I don't really know why but I enjoy playing this game."
2,Pictochat.. with shopping!,"It's a chat game that lets you draw pictures. But... the DS already COMES with a game that lets you chat and draw pictures! Just use that!The one fun aspect of this game is that you get to dress up a character that represents you when you talk to your friends. But really, none of my friends have this game, so it's pretty much pointless and boring."
3,boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this game was fun at first but now the only fun thing to do is the top 10 game but considering i got it for under 7 dollers i think i should have gotten another one for my friend so that i could acually chat
1,Real dumb,"This is a really dumb, meaningless game. Glad I didn't pay for it. Spend your money wisely and on other DS games. Any one of them is better than this."
3,This Game Is OK,"Ping Pals is a game for nintendo DS. It is pretty fun, although without a friend it can be very boring:( On Ping Pals there is a little window in the upper left hand corner with your name and the person you have on Ping Pals. It knows your name because you have programmed it into your DS. Anyways, you start out with some items like hair, clothes, and facial items. You can sell your items and/or buy new ones. There are also some games, like Top Ten and Hi-Lo. You can earn money by playing them. There is also a game called Solo Chat, but that isn't really fun because all you can type is either yes or no otherwise the computer character you are talking will say, ""I don't understand!"" Even if you type ""Yes, of course!"" or yes with an exlamation point or period the computer character will STILL get confused. If you want to buy this game, I'd buy one used or not buy one at all. It is pretty fun, but it's not the best."
2,Why buy fancy Pictochat?,"This game is just a fancy version of Pictochat. The whole ""person"" thing is boring, and you don't need it for a simple chatting software. I think THQ was trying almost to make a mini wireless sims, where you could talk to other people and trade items, but believe me, NO ONE WILL BE ON!!! I preordered this game before the DS came out, and the game looked fun. back then I also thought the DS could connect to a Wireless Hotspot and go online, but, i was wrong. Another Downside to this game is that there are the totally crappy games, especially ""solo chat"". the stupidest one is ""hot potato"" where you and a friend type ""pass"" when you get the vurtual potato. fun. But really, stick to Pictochat, this is a waste of your money."
2,"Um, did THQ even know that Pictochat is around????","Okay, if you got this for free (ex. friend gave it to you, got it as a gift, ect.) you can't really complain, but if you bought it yourself then..... you have a problem. First of all I was at gamestop a couple weeks ago and looking at the 5 DS games they had. I highly doubted they would have used DS games because they just came out but they had a used Ping Pals. That was one clue this game (well it's not a game really) was a rip off. Pictochat really is better than this! DOn't be convinced by the ""cartoon caracters"" you can customize, it's terrible! Next THQ will start selling Icecubes to escimos! I know something funner than this. Take your DS stylus and poke you brother/sister with it. Wasn't that fun??!-Doug"
1,LOAD OF JUNK,"DO NOT BUY!!!! I got and all u do is talk and play 2 cheap minigames. I tried 2 sell it and only got 5 bucks and i bought it for $30. I repeat,DO NOT BUY THIS DUMB GAME!!!!!!!!!"
1,Do not buy!,"It is a shame Nintendo made this game. I thought it would be a game where you could play tons of really fun mini games. I was WRONG! There are 2 singe player mini games and 2 multi-player mini games. They aren't even fun to play at all. With those mini games you get coins to buy clothes stuff for your character, which is really stupid. I would suggest that you buy this game if you like limited games that aren't fun and if you like to dress up things things, only to look at them while you play the boring mini games. So save yourself the money and buy some good game like Super Mario 64 DS or something like that!"
2,,Now this is a game that REALLY isnt worth your money. All this does is make chatting a little bit weirder. Now if ur a young person trying to look old or an old person trying to look young u might wanna buy this piece of one of ds's little failures. Little minigames and buying clothes while chatting is all u can do on this game take my advice and stay away from this game.
1,Oh my gosh!!!,Oh no! Where is the 0 star option for this review! I want my money back and the last 30 minutes of my life. This cartridge is pretty much an upgrade of Pictochat which is already built in the DS. I think you better off getting a root canal than dealing with this game! Now call your dentist and get your root canal appointment. You'll have more fun with that instead!
5,Sweet,"I'm not a big fan of these kind of games,but damn it looks pretty good.It is almost like mario party mini games but just with using ur personolized character instead of mario characters.So if ur a kid get this for christmas.I hope this was helpful.Blue."
1,Not That Much Fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first played it I was confused.So I read the directions.But when you talk to a character you half to say yes or no or they go off line so my point is read the directions first, thier clothes but thet cost coins so it's not a really fun game."
3,No clue!,i really dont know what this game is about because i saw it in a store. Is it really good? Please tell me!
1,THQ rip-off!!!,"I thought this game would be a fun chat program with lots of little extras. Imagine my surprise to find out that out of the ""thousands of items"" you can buy there are only 300 on each cart. So unless you have a multitude of friends who want to waste $30 each then your stuck with only 300 items. What a giant waste of money. Pictochat is just as good and it's bundled free with the DS."
2,Yes or No,this game is fun but threre is realy no point. All you realy do is talk with fake people and you can say yes or no. You can also get points to customize your screen and person. THQ put many chatrooms in but if there is no one is like the same room of course all you can do is say yes or no.
4,Ping Pals,"This game is pretty fun. The outfits are pretty neat (although I can't find many outfits to buy for girls) and it's even fun when you have to play by yourself. It has a sort of game called solo chat. it'll hook you up a conversation with a stranger who's not real. Also, the items in the store sometimes changes and it's easy to get coins!"
3,Not exactly what I wanted.,"I got this hoping it would allow me to keep the Zune (30GB original) as slim as possible, which it does, however I didn't care for the clip that's on the back of it and the screen protector isn't real clear. It got a kind of powdery dust inside after being on for a while and one of the nice things with the Zune is the bright and clear screen, something this skin detracts from. It does add protection as described and is thin, just not what I was hoping for.Instead, I ran over to Best Buy and grabbed one of those generic stick on belt clips and am carring the Zune around naked, so to speak. If I were seeking protection for it, I'd probably take it to a store and look for a generic BlackBerry or cell phone leather case that would allow me to easily remove it when in use or when changing mediums and then just drop it back in there when finished."
2,Basin does not drain completely,"The problem with this sink is that water does not drain completely from the basin; it pools around a ridge surrounding the drain. Also, installation is difficult because of the way the top of the pedestal is designed."
1,It's a joke!,"Don't waste your money because I did! I bought it from another online store. Although its money back guarantees, but I still lost my S & H. The quality of the product is so poor that I don't think it should be put into the market. It is worthless. First of all, the batteries included doesn¡t work in my case. After I inserted my own batteries, the UV light worked but the facial function didn't. Then I left the switch on and attached the facial massager to the unit, turning the attachment clockwise by my hand then it started spinning. It stopped when I put the unit against my face, I had to repeat the hand turning again to make it spins. I also tried the face suction, it's a total joke! I almost cry! Now I am waiting for the return authorization number so that I can get my money back! I never write a product review before, but I have to write this time to warn other consumers. I don¡t want you to have the painful experience as I did with this product!"
1,IGIA Pore Cleanzer - Do not buy it!,The IGIA Pore Cleanzer is nothing but a piece of junk! It does not clean the pores like it says it does. The face brush will not spin if you apply even slight pressure. The suction it claims it has is nothing but a joke. You Can Save.com will not accept it back once youv'e opened the package. Do not waste your money.
1,Don't Buy This...unless you like to waste money,"I bought this item, had it for a day and immediately returned it. It did not ""suction"" any blackheads like it claimed."
1,The LatchKey Dog,Ordered a NEW copy of this book. Sent an obviously USED copy. Tried to rectify with Amazon. Absolutely NO satisfaction from Amaaon - in fact - got NO reponse at all from Amazon about this. Will not order again from an associated book seller. I am NOT a satisfied customer!!
1,Proper training?,"Did I read a different book? While the case studies and examples are great, each chapter comes to the same conclusion: Proper training will help. How do you retrain a dog that has been led down the wrong path by its owner? Don't look here for that answer. In spite of all of the examples of misbehavior, the ""proper training"" is left a mystery that is best solved, apparently, by hiring the author as a private trainer. Very frustrating."
5,it covers dog *and* owner behavior,"I am only partway through this book, but have already told friends how useful it is already. I've talked to vets and trainers, and read some other training books to deal with my two recently adopted 8 year old dogs, and this is the first one that really gets into how the owner's behavior affects the dog's behavior beyond ""be alpha."""
5,You and your Dog NEED this Book!,"This is hand's down the best book I have ever read on the subject of dog training, and especially dog behavior. It is educational and entertaining at the same time. This book goes beyond just telling you how to ""fix"" your dog's problems (or more correctly YOUR problems), it explains why they happen in the first place, so you can recognize why your dog behaves the way he/she does. This book is a MUST for any dog owner- and especially those of us who treat our dogs like members of our family- which can be the cause of many behavior problems in our beloved pets (read the book to find out why). The author isn't saying that your dog can't be a member of your family- she definitely thinks they can and should be, just that they simply shouldn't RULE your family. If you love your dog at all and want to better understand him/her and be able to communicate more effectively with him/her buy this book!"
5,A teacher's life preserver for helping the ADD child,"This is by far the best resource on ADD with an easily readable text that I have ever read and is incredibly beneficial to parents, teachers and children. It explains ADD in direct terms and offers a plethora of real strategies, not just concepts, to help the ADD child. It is a must read for anyone who deals with ADD on a daily basis."
4,Marvelous!,The UFOs of October is an entertaining and insightful look at life and shows Robert Bove to be excellent poet who can combine humor and sensitivity. The poems covering his job reporting on UFOs in Honduras is the most entertaining but the whole work stands on its own as a solid achievement.
2,Graduate Nursing Student,"I found the book vague and unclear. It was recommended as a ""reference"" book for a graduate level pathophysiology course and it was the first book I returned. There are several other books on pathophysiology that are on the market for about the same price or a bit more that are MUCH more thorough and useful for undergraduate, graduate or medical student reference. I would NOT recommend this book for anyone looking at any type of indepth medical information."
1,Have a Stab at Classic Disney: Volume 4,"If you are thinking of purchasing this DVD in hopes of some classic Mickey Mouse cartoons? Then will you be disappointed. These are essentially three types of ""remixes"":- ""BLAM!"" This is just clips of the classic cartoons with cheesy 90's type narrations and an obnoxious high school dropout shouting the word ""BLAM!!!"" every time Donald Duck is hit on the head with something or another. Search ""Disney Blam"" on YouTube to experience this travesty for yourself.- ""Re-Micks"" These are Mickey Mouse shorts mixed up to modern music. (Hannah Montana, Jonas Brothers). Great toons, terrible songs.- ""Short Versions"" These are just the shorts cut down and re dubbed to about three minutes long instead of 8. The interesting thing about these is that we get to hear Brett Iwane as Mickey, as Wayne Allwine passed away last year.In conclusion DO NOT BUY. Go for the Walt Disney Treasures sets instead. These have the cartoons uncut and with a great deal of extras."
2,Smells like nothing...don't think it deodorizes at all.,"This spray smelled like nothing at all...didn't seem to ""deodorize"" or really anything...maybe it was old, or expired. It was like spraying water on my dogs."
3,Great little camera unless you are trying to take a photo without holding it.,"I really like most aspects of this camera. The photos are high quality, the videos are really good and the zoom is very good. However, the bottom is rounded. Trying to take a timed photo with no one holding the camera is a pain. Additionally, there is no place where you can attach a stand."
3,Not as good as I imagined it,"I was very exited ordering this product, because I thought it will be as great as Magz are. But its not. I am actually very disappointed and I think that it is very overpriced. Do not buy this 90 peace set, because its not worth the money. First thing it is not as strong as small MAGZ are. If you try to build a bigger object, and you try to lift it, it breaks very easily, and the transparent panels - I don't like them at all. It is very hard to put them in right place so they hold in it, because if you push to hard it falls inside your object or it falls out. And it doesn't make your objects stronger. My son loves playing with it, but he use only balls and bars. He is trying to use panels sometimes too, but he gets frustrated when it takes so long to put it in the right place. You think you buy 90 peaces set, but there is 30 panels that are almost useless. Sorry but that is my opinion."
5,I Agree ... One of the Best,"This is a great book for both the beginner and the experience writer. It walks you through the process without holding your hand. Outlining the process from start to finish it can help the self-taught refresh their memories and to double check themsleves while providing a start to finish map for the new author to follow. Even for those who don't need the information contained within its covers, this is a good read that makes you think about the subject."
5,Excellent Writer--Excellent Read (highly recommend),"... Even though this book is specifically for writing mysteries,it is by far the best of all the writing books I have.Besides being a great writer, which makes this book a quick and enjoyable read, Larry gives practicle advice, inspiration, examples, and walks you through each step of writing a mystery.I've put aside all other writing books and I'm reading this one for the second time.It is well worth the money."
2,General,"This book falls into the big category: Too general and vague to be any good for a mystery writer.Sure, it holds some information about good writing, but for that purpose there are tons of better books. As for mystery, this book does not give you any good plotting instructions, any good storytelling etc.Buy another book or save your money."
3,Lots of good information,"I'm writing my first mystery and I need all the help I can get!This book was more helpful than just a general how-to-write book; it's focused on the mystery writer and his or her especial needs.It's a lot of fun, and yes, I did laugh out loud at a few parts. Good read.Sorry about the three stars, but only the JANE EYREses of the world get five from me."
3,Frank and informative,"If nothing else, books on writing can help jumpstart your engine when writing. Mr. Beinhart's contribution to helping writers is a whodoesit (discussion on mystery writers) and a howdoit (on writing a mystery), and offers some thought-provoking insights."
2,Very one sided,"If your a GFR fan or collector then I recommend this book for collection purposes only. The book is totally pro Don Brewer only. It bashes Mark Farner several times, at one point saying Brewer is a more prolific writer of the bands songs. That is not even remotely correct. Mark wrote 90% of the songs. I recommend From Grand Funk to Grace which is an authorized biography that doesn't contain any put downs. Mark admits his flaws. This was just too one sided for me. I give it 2 stars because it does have some good info & pictures but I wish it was more a biography then a contest of whose better. It took all 3 (sometimes 4) of them to make the band, not just 1."
3,Just started - see some errors...,"Not a promising beginning, though I am looking forward to reading this as GFR has been one of my favorite bands. There is a typo on the very first page of the book (Don Brewer's forward) and when I couldn't find the listing of the show I attended, I discovered that it was listed as Binghampton, VT instead of Binghamton, NY. Oh well. Will amend upon further reading...."
3,Nice but nothing new.,"DearS is about aliens who crash land on Earth and are now working to become part of society. Lucky for the lonely Takeya he ends up with an alien honey, called Ren, who needs an education about how to get along with humans.This manga reminds me of Chobits mixed with Imadoki!, or Video Girl mixed with Tenchi Muyo, or Oh My Goddess mixed with Azumanga Daioh. You get the idea, sexy alien girl meets Earth high school boy who knows nothing about how to handle a girl. In other words, same old same old."
2,didn't really help,"This book is very short and doesn't really have any good suggestions or solutions. I have flat feet and a lot of pain in my feet and lower legs (up to knees) because of it. This book tries to solve that problem with visualization techniques to get you to walk correctly and keep your ankle, calf bones and knees lined up correctly. But it didn't have any concrete steps one could take to minimize foot and knee pain. No exercises or recommendations on shoe inserts, etc. I wanted and expected more from it."
1,a major disappointment,"As bad as a book can be considering the significance and potential interest of the topic: This work is part of a series of short histories of aspects of the 20th century, but Mr. Murray has no gift for compression nor does he write well. But, above all, Mr. Murray is factually challenged. I know well only one area of those that he covers, namely the Pacific War, and specifically the Battle for Leyte Gulf, but in that area Mr. Murray is stunningly inaccurate, with error following error. Furthermore, and astonishingly, Mr. Murray is just as inaccurate in the more comprehensive book that he published with Allan R. Millett the following year, A War to Be Won. In the circumstances, I must follow the the editor's maxim that if one part of a book that you know about is unreliable, the quality of the rest must remain in doubt. This book doesn't even deserve one star."
4,Take it from a teacher,"While I agree with another reviewer that there are similarities to Tim Burton, there are some key differences. Burton wrote children's books geared toward adults. Madame M has worked hard to create great books for reluctant readers. Check out her website, creepylittlestories.com, and you'll see what I mean. Her rhymes help kids learn syllables and vowels. Her gothic persona attracts kids who don't like sappy sweet cute stories. This book is excellent for kids. I highly recommend it."
3,oh my goth,"following on the tails of tim burtons and angus oblongs quirky spooky bedtime stories, these by madame m do not dissapoit. check out other cute gothy books by roman dirge, brandon ragan, and voltaire."
1,Disappointed; Product geared for American market,"Zut alors! I was very hopeful of this product since it was actually French-made. However, in catering to the American market, the product is much too sweet and does not have the rich dark chocolate flavor of the hot chocolate that you can find on the shelf in practically any store in France. It was more like tasteless chocolate dishwater than hot chocolate, although it looked and smelled authentic. If you are looking for the hot chocolate you loved pour votre petit déjeuner in France, keep looking."
1,"A new translation, but not of St. Therese's original manuscript","This is a new translation, not of St. Therese's authentic manuscripts, which have been available in French since 1956, but of a version heavily edited by her sister Pauline, who made about seven thousand changes to Therese's work, virtually rewriting her sister's autobiography. Those who want to read what Therese wrote, not what Pauline wrote, should readStory of a Soul: The Autobiography of St. Therese of Lisieux, Third EditionThat edition, a translation of the 1973 centenary edition of St. Therese's own manuscript by Fr. John Clarke, OCD, and published by ICS Publications, is universally recognized as the authoritative English translation."
1,Not so hot for large pusters,My daughter had a 5 foot poster to hang in her kindergarten room. We put 2 strips which was the whole roll. It fell down overnight and would not go back up. A waste of money. Some of there other products are good so I purchased on that basis.
1,Would like to watch it if it would play in any DVD player.,"I bought this DVD about 4 years ago as the Foo Fighters are one of my favorite bands and I will buy about anything they put out. I have tried this DVD in about 4 or 5 different DVD players, in my Playstation 3, and in my Sony Blu Ray player and it will not play on any of them, I guess due to the region encoding. I own at least 50 concert DVDs/Blu Rays including about 3 others from Foo Fighters and this is the only one I have had problems with. I think it did play on my computer but I purchased it to play on my home theater systems instead of on the cpu."
4,no dvd still ?,have always enjoyed this movie as one of my war favorites and after all these years and with all the other schlock on dvd and blu-ray i wonder what in the world is holding up the release of this movie ? any ideas anyone ?
2,Poor adaptation of an excellent book,"I was very disappointed in Platoon Leader. The book on which it is (very) loosely based is an excellent account of how a well-trained but inexperienced young lieutenant became a true leader and soldier. While the book is introspective and enlightening, the movie is just crass violence that has no message, and no real storyline for that matter. Even worse, the movie has so many inaccuracies that even a non-soldier like myself was left groaning -- ambushes in which the entire squad sits together in a tight circle in the middle of a field, firefights in which groups of soldiers stand shoulder-to-shoulder, grenades detonating in large fireballs, and everyone always firing from the hip on full-automatic are a few examples. At least the Rambo movies had better acting (much better). Avoid this movie unless you enjoy old Sunday afternoon westerns in which cowboys never miss and their six-shooters never run out of ammunition."
4,Oyster,"Having never been in Vietnam myself, but in the Army in the 70s, I explained offhand to a young 26 year old man how herion was a huge problem in Vietnam, how a lot of GIs came back hooked.He understnadably could not understand how people got hooked on herion of all things in a combat zone.I thought of the herion death scene in Platoon leader, and remebered by and large it was a terrific movie.Thats why I found it on Amazon and ordered it, mostly to show him our current troubles seem insignificant to the fatalities suffered then.I havent seen the movie in gee, 15 years? Ive never forgotten it, tho."
1,platoon leader,I order a dvd not vhs not happyI would like my order sent correctly next time if there is a next time.
2,Terrible!,This movie is plain bloody hopeless! The movie doesn't even have a bloody storyline! This movie is just too bloody violent! So i would bloody well not recommend this to anyone!P.S Sorry about the language
5,One of 2003's best,This would be an extraordinary from anyone but is even more so when you consider Cale's output over the last 20 years; this is an almighty resurrection. Every track is very strong and the album as a whole is of consistent high quality; 'Bicycle' surely should be a hit song. Like 'turnermorgan' I can't stop listening to this one.
4,we are all stars...,"John Cale was always the cool member of the Velvet Underground. I used to see him ten years ago walking around the East Village. I didn't know it was him, but one day I saw him for the tenth time and said to myself: ""That is John Cale."" Lately he has been doing film scores and being interviewed for punk documentaries. He was in the center of the punk movement because he produced a lot of cool albums. His solo work has always been hit or miss. It has always been interesting. Listening to his voice in songs like the song ""Zen"" he reminds me of Tindersticks. Cale has always been art obsessed. Here he does a song called ""Magritte."" This album is overall pretty damn good. Nobody really expects him to do anything new or good, but John Cale surprises us. He is still an artist with a vision."
5,cale does not disappoint,"after the UK release of '5 Tracks' last year, very strong stuff, but would the album live up to it? the report is simple: yes. cale has made what is perhaps his best albumno caveat to that (since 'Fear' or since 'New Society')just his besthe's dug into his own melodic mine and come up with some of his most haunting and evocative lyrics, all wrapped in a 'new' style which humanises computer composition... it's been several years (was the man possibly without a recording contract?!) and well worth the wait... the album is smart, sassy, knowing, compassionate and very, very rich.if you do come to this album, make absolutely sure you find '5 Tracks'... a Welshman in New York, and clearly of the 21st century.Cale here and now.magnificent."
4,Return to Form,"John Cale is back in geopolitical mode on his return to form HoboSapiens. This being the later Cale, much of the lyrical content is obscure, not to mention unintelligible. But the freaky strains of his world encompassing musical palette gets us over the tough spots with its compelling forward motion. These are snapshots of a world in crisis, and Cale has always been more convincing when he's hotstepping with anger than playing the classically trained card. HoboSapiens doesn't equal his brilliant Island trilogy of the 70's, but it comes close enough to touch them."
3,Great Characters,"I really liked this book because although it focuses mainly on Evan Morgan, it gives a lot of detail and focus on the other characters and their spiritual journeys as well as there search for true love. The histroy is probably my favorite thing about these books and they create an amazing back drop for these two families. I definitely recommend this book. However, reading the three before would be better. This does occur quite a few years after the 3rd one. It did seem to drag on somewhat but the myriad of characters and situations kept me reading."
4,"Fine archival set of true, authentic Mexican music","I have a special fondness for the densely patterned, hypnotic ballad style of the son jarocho which comes from the Huasteca region of Mexico's Eastern central coast... This collection covers the wider regional music known as the ""huapango,"" which intersects with the jarocho tradition, but also includes a wide variety of Mexican folk musics. There is some of the driving, percussive, ornate melodic sound of the sones jarochos, but branches out into starker, more informal styles as well, streetcorner chants and the like. This is a fine selection of deeply traditional, authentic Mexican music, perhaps in parts not as melodically striking as other recordings that highlight harps and guitars, but still quite rich in feeling and tradition. Includes tracks by artists such as the Trio Los Campos De Valles, Danza De Moctezuma, Trio Despertar Huasteco, and others. Definitely worth checking out!"
3,Great journal,This was a great book. I enjoyed it and also purchased one as a gift for a friend. I would reccommend it.
2,Too female-centerd,"This book is really geared toward women who are into feminism. All the quotes in the book are from women in her groups. If you're not into the female-identity world, pick another book."
1,These people do not give the original dampit BEWARE!,"These people did not give the original dampit but a cheap dis-colored cheaper chinese looking made dampit....BEWARE! I was cheap out! I bought from Brookmays.com, I guess that is what I get for going for the cheapest one, beware guys!"
2,not what i was expecting,"The item advertised was ""The original Dampit cello humidifier"". What shipped to me was a knockoff imitation product by a company called ""Paganini"", attempting to pass as the real thing. It was cheap though, so I kept it. Still, I feel like I got screwed."
2,"Great idea, poor construction","I had the same issue many others did...the idea was great! I loved it the first time I used it! Unfortunately, the second time I used it, the top washer/sealer came unattached, and now to get it to work at all, I have to spend 10 minutes trying to wrestle it back into place (at which point it leaks). I'll be looking for another one of these made by a different company.."
5,My Most Useful Wedding Gift,"I love this handy kitchen adjust a cup so much that I gave them out as gifts for weddings, birthdays and so one. I have never had a problem with it and everyone I have given them to loves there's also.I highly recommend this product for anyone who bakes, it's a must have."
5,Kitchen Adjust a cup,"The Kitchen Art Pro 2 Cup adjust a cup is very easy to use. Just lower the bottom piston in the cup to the desired amount, fill the cup with what ever you are measuring, and remove any thing piled up on top with a knife back or dough cutter and you have your measured amount left in the cup. Very easy. It appears to be made from a polycarbonate. I may be wrong. It is pretty sturdy."
5,Great Measuring Cup,"This is absolutely perfect for measuring gooey stuff (i.e. peanut butter, mayo). If you bake or cook with such items this is a must have. I would also suggest the smaller size as well."
1,"Good idea, bad execution","I've used this particular measuring device about 8 times total.It's gone through the dishwasher each time. After the last time, I heard water sloshing inside. The black seal on top came apart and it doesn't look easily repairable.The ideas is great for mayonnaise, sour cream and honey. It does require maintenance between each washing and use. You need to rub a little oil around the top rubber seal so it slides easier.There are similar models where the underside is hollow with no danger of water getting trapped that I'd be willing to try."
1,Received broken,"This item was broken.... plastic cracked ... when received. I cannot locate the correct place to return it so rather than fussing with it, I'm going to throw it out and forget about it."
1,Broken when I took it from the package,"I bought 2, one as a gift and one for me. Mine fell apart in my hand. I emailed customer service, no response."
5,no comment,I have not comment and having to type eightteen or more words in order to submit a review is crazy
4,Good multipurpose measure,Adjustable outer cup is secure and doesn't slip easily. This has been great for measuring brown sugar and peanut butter.
2,Cheaply made.,I would not recommend the KitchenArt measuring cup. I received this as a Christmas gift and find the product to be cheaply made. The adjustment of the cup is much too lose making it hard to keep in place and measure accurately. Also not well designed for liquid measurements.
4,Great Item for Measuring!,"As much as I like to cook, I don't like cluttering up my kitchen with gadgets that don't earn their keep. This one does!It's very handy for liquids or dry ingredients, having 6 different measuring columns on the sides to measure either dry or liquid ingredients in cups, ounces or ml. The liquids conveniently have that extra grace section at the top so that you don't have to fill to the edge, as you do with the dry ingredients, such as flour. What I especially appreciate it for are the sticky, gooey things like peanut butter, honey, molasses, butter, etc. It's incredibly easy to measure out exactly how much you need; a quick push up from the bottom and the ingredient is completely ejected just where you need it. You can measure as little as 1/8cp or as much as 2 cps. It's easy to clean it afterwards, too."
5,measuring creamy or sticky stuff?,"This is great for measuing yogurt, applesauce, molasses, honey and stuff like that. There is no need to use this for normal liquid or dry stuff but when you work with those other things, you can measure accurately and get it all out. I was inspired to buy this watching Alton Brown use either it or a similar product."
4,Good but not great,"It does exactly what you'd think it does. It's actually pretty cool, but so far I haven't actually used it as much as I thought I would. For some reason, I still find a 2-cup measuring cup more useful.Update:I've had this for several months now, and I've noticed that even though the item is dishwasher safe and there's no actual damage, water gets trapped inside the plunger-piece and sloshes around after I run it through the dishwasher. Doesn't affect the usability, just kind of annoying to hear it sloshing around."
2,An adjustable disappointment,"When I first got this, I was very excited. I felt as if I had beat the system by purchasing such a versatile, all-in-one tool.I used it the first few times and it was just great. It did a great job helping me perfectly level off gooey and semi solid ingredients. Ricotta, honey, and sour cream all were measured out well and easily.About 2 weeks after having it, I noticed 2 things:1) the rubber gasket that seals the cup started to curl and warp. It started trapping ingredients and slipping when full like another reviewer mentioned.2) even worse, the body filled with a little water. This was from hand washing, no dishwasher. No way to remove the water.After another week or so with the cannister filled with water, the black base popped off. Another reviewer mentioned the same problem.The concept is great, the execution is poor. I really wanted to love this thing."
2,"Good idea, but...","I got one of these after Alton Brown raved about it. I find the outer sleeve tends to slowly, slowly slip down when there are liquid ingredients, resulting in the ingredients oozing or flowing over the device. The other day I wound up with ketchup all over the ""adjust-a-cup"" as I tried to measure ingredients for a barbecue sauce.I guess this works with dry ingredients, but then, why would you need it for dry ingredients?"
2,"Decent for certain products, not a worthy kitchen addition for me","This measuring cup is awkward, expensive, and space consuming for the very minor task that it achieves well. Basically, if you measure a lot of corn syrup, molasses, mayo, or other very gooey substances, then this cup is indeed a good design.Otherwise, though, it's a hassle to clean, it's worthless for dry ingredients, and not worth the effort for other ingredients. It's a classic single-purpose gizmo that seems likely to sit unused for years. I'd rather just use a cup and a spatula like everyone else."
4,"Great for measuring peanut butter, shortening, cream cheese...","This thing is very cool. My hubby was wanting one to be like Alton Brown, and I had seen a more expensive version at Pampered Chef. It lives up to its promise of making measurement of sticky, difficult to measure ingredients easy. I don't think it has much advantage for dry goods, butter, and liquids, since it is a bit more difficult to clean and cannot be microwaved. Unfortunately, ours was ridiculously difficult to slide up and down (It will be stiff so that liquids can be measured) when we first received it and within a few minutes one side of ours came unglued, so it had to be replaced (hence 1 star off for sketchy quality control)."
3,this is the wallflower of my many measuring cups,"I've had this measuring cup for years, one of those things that I saw in a kitchen gadget store and thought, ""wow, that will be soooo useful!"" but in reality, this one is kind of a dud.I don't measure sticky things like peanut butter very often and if I did, the sleeve is so firm to move that it would probably be pretty frustrating to get it to dislodge the ingredient.This is also somewhat awkward to load because of the extra height. Doesn't unload very easily either as the rim is extremely straight so it tends to spill just a little when tipped near a bowl.I've found that the old fashioned four cup sets or something like the Emsa Perfect beaker work better for me in my kitchen. Everyone is different though and I'm sure by the reviews that this works very well for some cooks."
1,Great concept; poor execution.,"I've had a Wonder Cup for years and years. Since the numbers were finally starting to wear down a bit, I purchased this cup. I'm not sure how the other reviewers are having a hard time moving the plunger, because mine won't stay put. I use these exclusively for shortening, as I'm an avid baker. Because you have to push the shortening into the measuring cup (to remove air pockets), this product doesn't work for me. On the Wonder Cup, when you push down, the plunger stays on the mark. For this one, the plunger moves with the slightest pressure, so I cannot use it to measure shortening without holding my finger at the bottom of the outside cylinder to keep it from moving. What a pain! Otherwise, the concept is good. It gives you liquid and solid measurements and plenty of them. I just with it would be of use. I finally threw the thing away."
1,A little disappointed,"Received this recently & have used it about 3 times & it's already slipping, I guess that inner rubber gasket doesn't grab very well. Too bad because it's such a great idea & I really wanted to use this alot but it becomes a bit of a juggling act to keep it from slipping and thus ending up with an inaccurate measurement.Giving it one star because I only read the fives and ones & obviously can't give it five so giving it one in the hopes others will see this, I don't actually HATE it but am pretty disappointed...."
4,Great measuring cup but wears out after awhile,This is a great product and a great measuring cup for ingredients like shortening. However be aware that after a few years of use the rubber seal starts to wear out making the measuring cup hard to adjust and hard to use
1,Number sub off,"I have had mine for about 8 weeks and the number on the side are already rubbing off. i am considering covering the outside with packaging tape to be sure no more numbers come off, but this is very sad for me because without the numbers it is useless. If its good enough for Alton, it might only last a few uses."
1,SORRY P.O.S.,"First time out the package, half the lettering has rubbed off. What good is a measuring cup without any measurements? very dissapointed..."
1,This 2-cup size has issues,"I have tried two different sizes of this item. This big 2-cup version did not work properly, so I sent it back and kept the smaller tablespoon size one, since it works much better. The main issue was that the plunger seal would not grip the sides of the sleeve, so it would wobble a lot, kept falling and losing the measurement that I set. Even with ingredients in it, the sleeve would fall down, big mess.. I decided to try one of the yellow plunger measuring cups next and I find that they grip and hold the measurement much better. I'm happy now."
1,Hope you actually didn't need to measure anything,"Well while the idea is great, this items quality is junk. I've had it for about 2 months now and have used it off and on. Contrary to what other reviewers have said, I had no issues with the plunger. My problem is that the printing on the side wipes off. Yes that's right, for $10 you can buy a measuring cup that actually isn't useful for measuring anything. I know everyone will be like, did you put it in paint thinner, or use lemons. No I used water, to wash it up, and in so doing, off with the print on the side.Well to the trash with you, next time I'm giving the homeless outside my loft the $10"
1,Not Too Happy,"This thing broke before I could even use it. I took it out of the box and when I went to pull it apart to wash it the black top of the pusher came right off. It had just a little dab of glue in two spots holding it on. I really needed it so I just superglued it back on.I baked one Pecan pie and two Pumkins and when I used it to measure the Karo for peanut brittle the bottom pulled off. Same problem, very little glue holding it on. I superglued the bottom too because I was in the middle of something and meeded to finish. Very poor workmanship."
2,Look Elsewhere,"I bought this device because I had a less fancy one from Pampered Chef that worked so well, I jumped at the chance for another one. While this one has a nice shiny finish, you can't turn it inside out for liquids; you can only use it for dry or wet solids and syrups. It broke after about five uses. If I had the choice, I would not by again - I'll just get another one from Pampered Chef or another brand. You're better off buying one that you can adjust for solids and dry (like sour cream, pureed pumpkin) that can be turned around for liquids like like or broth."
1,Waste of money,"The lines that indicate the amounts wipe right off. I have to redraw them on with a sharpie. It is also loose fitting & the clear plastic outer part will slide down as you are measuring items, causing a mess! I am very disappointed & would not recommend this product. I plan to return it to amazon if they will refund my money."
3,"Great tool, bottom fell off","I loved using this adjust-a-cup, but after only a few months of use the bottom plastic part fell off. I never ran it in the dishwasher or anything, but I suppose the light washing I did probably loosened the glue. I contacted the company to ask about a replacement but heard no response."
1,Has a Cheap Seal,"Used this thing for several weeks until the seal on the 'piston' fell apart. Typical consumer product these days, a good idea with poor execution because of one or two weak/cheap parts. I can almost guarantee the seal will fail within a year's time on this thing, rendering it useless."
2,Not as useful as I thought,"I saw Alton Brown use it on his show, I bought it to try it out. It works ok but it is bit hassle to because if you don't use it often the rubber seal dries up and it is hard to move it.I went back to my old measuring tools as it was faster to use.Sometimes gadgets are more trouble then worth, I found my 2 cut pyrex measuring cup more useful, so this is now in my basement along with other tools I bought and don't use."
3,Nothing spectacular...,"For years, imperial officers were scarce among Hasbro's line-up of ""Star Wars"" figures. One released in 1998 became particularly popular with fans and collectors. This year, we've already seen two of them -- and Jerjerrod may not be the one You want to buy.This is not a bad figure, although his face does not quite match the actor from ""Return of the Jedi"", who portrayed the character. Otherwise, the sculpting is OK, but the figure does not offer anything special to make it truly worth buying.A figure with a similar body, but a different head, is General Veers -- also from this year's ""The Saga Collection"". He comes with a helmet to put on and a removable chest armor, though. If You want an Imperial, than buy Veers."
5,Suzy made it a bit pompous but it's good...,"The book on my grandfather, named a ship after him...a southern gentlemen in the old style, of incredible modesty and reserve. Put patton in at all his landings and ran a beach at D-Day. Used to sit and listen to him talk about his experiences in the pacific and european theaters. Took the pistol of the french general in command of algeria rather than his sword as the article of surrender...Suzy, my relative, did her phD thesis on this and was a little less than objective, but still quite an interesting book about the man."
5,An eclectic selection of twelve short stories,"Scum & Other Tales is an engaging and eclectic selection of twelve short stories by Richard Bellush, Jr., about a series of eccentric characters, each one just barely on the other side of reality. From a would-be vampire killer, to the intelligence-challenged survivors of an asteroid impact, to the sellers of a substance called ""Scum"" that embodies all the worst traits of junk food and then some, Scum & Other Tales never disappoints in its out-of-this world settings that hold up a curved, funhouse-style mirror to the dark twists of reality."
4,Good.,"I bought it and think its great. Alot of important things we're convered after edited, although the music was cut out and i was alittle disapointed on how much they actually cut. Some parts you can just notice we're missing, but in all it's good and worth purchasing. I cant wait till the second one comes out."
1,Disappointing... not a romance movie,This movie's more about kids who get into trouble than a great romance movie.The main teacher character (Alejandra Barros) is much better in the movie MARIANA DE LA NOCHE (which I would rate as 4*).The best romance soap is LA OTRA.
2,About Intermatic Malibu lights,"Was not to happy with the delivery. A couple of the lights rings were bent out of shape and were hard to put together.One of the power packs in the shipment did not work. The timer clock was not working. It does not record the time. I had to purchase a outdoor timer to plug the unit into.Thank You, James Doddato"
2,The Plank,"The plank is a collectors movie. Of the two versions made, a black and white version and colour, I prefer the colour version, primarily because of the cast, which includes many of the British comedy actors of that era. Humour changes like fashion and some of the over-acting that was fashionable in Britain during the sixties and seventies has lost some of its verve. If you can get past that then the movie is classic slap stick and under statement."
3,Caution,"Just a word of caution- this is the 1967 version.Its good, but the 1979 version has a different cast with all the great actors, and is much better, but seemingly unavailable."
3,"Looks very cheap. I was impressed with the time it took to get here, very quick.","It looks home made. i could have made one myself on my computer and printed a cover, but it will do for what I want."
4,Cult viewing,"You'd need to be a Brit or understand Goons-type British humour to get this. If, like me, you do get it, it's funny. If you don't it's silent, mysterious slapstick. You'll love it or hate it."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"THIS WAS NOT THE VERSION I ORDERED. THE VERSION I ORDERED WAS ""ERIC SYKES & ARTHUR LOWEI AM VERY DISAPPOINTEDDavet"
5,Good old fashion comedy,"For anyone who loves good old fashion slapstick comedy, this dvd is for you. Must have a dvd player that will play the PAL format. A real shame this was not converted to NTSC."
3,Fair Read,"There were a few aspects of this book I did like. It was very informative, and as a young baseball fan I was opened up to four or five baseball player that I had never heard of before. Plus, there were several good points in this book. Hank Aaron was very underappreciated.I have to say though, the bad outweighs the good in this book. Barry Bonds is not the greatest player to ever play baseball, I do not think that this cannot be given to one particular player. Plus, it irked me when Kalb said,""If Bonds took steroids it was to become the best player he could become."" What a horrible and stupid statement, it left a distate for me during the rest of the book."
2,Overrated!,"I'm a baseball fanatic, and have read other books like this, esp. Bill James Historical Abstract. This book doesn't come close. Kalb's ratings are generally pretty good but the writing is sort of mediocre and his reliance on the clown princes of baseball Broadcasting (McCarver and Buck) just completely destroys any pretense of integrity. As Lewis says in MOneyball, most of what the average fan learns about baseball is bull-----, and most of it is from broadcasters. I do not know anyone who listens to Mc and Buck who doesn't marvel at their stupidity, so using them to bolster an argument about who's best is pretty feeble. OK reading for a trip or airplane trip but not especially well done."
2,Hard to breathe through the slot.,"I bought it to help stretch my back. When I lie on my stomach, the breathing slot is blocked by the steel support beam. I have to use some type of support under my forehead so I can breath. Due to back injuries I can not lie on my back, so I won't comment on its usefulness for that position."
3,Typical Late Innes,"The mixture of literary manuscripts, piratical treasure and noble eccentrics makes this typical late Innes, with far more speculation than either detection or action as Appleby investigates the fall of an archivist from the North Tower onto his head (and nearly on A.'s). Although theories of ""murder"" abound, this turns out to be as ill-founded a belief as that in either of the treasures."
1,Very poor quality,I purchased this item in the black beads. I could not recommend it at all. For the price it is very poor quality. The St. Florian medal is simply glued to the back of the Mother Mary piece. The cross is very lite-weight and all in all this is not worth the price.
5,Excellent Resource,"I found this book very useful as a resource for good advice on advertising. In my opinion, this unknown classic stands up there next to salesmen as Zig Ziglar to admen such as David Ogilvy."
4,thank you paramount !!!,"I was afraid the last season was going to be unobtainable for the true fans of the series,paramount has shown integrity and professionalism in allowing the true fans of the series to complete their collection,rambo fans would be sad if they could only purchase rambo 1 because ""some reviewers"" did not like the other follow up versions of the series,paramount and the ""employees involved"" in the release of the untouchables season 4 parts 1+2I SALUTE YOU !!!!!"
3,"The Untouchables, Season 4","I now have all 4 Seasons of the Untouchables; Season 4 has been a dissapointment. It has the appearance of a ""budget cut""; stories weren't as good, music is different, & even the filming is different. It just seems like a cheapened version of Seasons 1-3."
1,no stereo - mic doesn't sem to work,"bought this because I like the headphones on my ipod, and wanted something similar for my treo 680. So I bought the iPhone headphones (Apple Store Rep: ""Sure, they will fit your treo""). Not sure if adapter is defective or supposed to work this way but there is mono only and the mic doesn't work."
1,Only meant for ROKR,"I didn't realize that this adapter is only meant for the motorola Rokr. I tried the adapter with my Blackberry 8100, and it doesn't work at all. I hope I can return this."
1,Doesn't work for all Cingular Phones,Even though this is advertised as a Cingular package this doesn't work for all Cingular phones...I have an 8125 and it will convert the signal but it only comes out in one ear phone.
2,Didn't work for us,"I bought this so that my husband could plug his cell phone into an adapter to play his music through the car stereo. It may be his phone, but it didn't come through in stereo."
5,Did the Job for an LG Phone,"The intended purpose was to connect the audio from the mp3 player feature of an LG Wine II phone to the aux input of a 2008 Toyota Highlander stereo system. The LG uses a 2.5 mm four wire jack, and was built to accept a headset. The Highlander uses a 3.5 mm three wire female jack - standard issue on many portable audio devices. Also needed is a short 3.5 mm male to male adapter cable. Combine the two and you will have what you need to do the job.The issue with the LG phones is that the 2.5 mm jack is slightly recessed in the phone's case. The ""shoulders"" of the 2.5 mm end of this cable are wide enough so that they sit on two plasic ribs of the phone's case, so that the 2.5 mm plug cannot quite go all the way into the phone's connector. Despite this, I do have audio on both channels, so I'm satisfied. The fit is tight enough so that the connection stays made.At this low price, it's worth a try, and it did the job for me."
1,Poor quality sound,"I ordered six of these, and every one of them has terrible sound quality. The wire connecting the male and female jacks is extremely small. I would not recommend this unless the sound quality does not matter at all to you."
3,Kinda worked,The problem is some phones have different locations for the black lined thingies. And this one was different so it did not work very well. You have to have it half out to get full sound and the bass is horrid with this adapter but it gets the job done. Not fully working Hauwei Ascend M860 I bought 4 and there was only ONE that worked PROPERLY so pick wisely or get a whole bunch
2,Ordered by mistake,It wasn't what I needed. I am sure it worked fine but it was not what we needed. It was ordered by mistake.
2,Does not work for me,"This cable does not work as advertised with my 2.5mm jack-equipped Aigo mp3 player and Nuforce NE-7M earphones. This might be due to the inclusion of a microphone on my earphones, which extends the 3.5mm plug by one section."
3,"Decent cable, but doesn't work for the 8100 Blackberry as advertised....","This cable is just fine, but it won't convert Blackberry 8100 or Pearls to standard headphones as advertised...bummer."
2,Not what I expected,"The product picture showed 3 contacts. I expected to be able to use this with my phone. This is audio only. The product name did state it was audio, but the discription was lacking any real details. When I used it with my phone, the audio was scratchy and noisy. This could be due to th fact that my phone also needed a mic.The shipping time was very fast."
2,Not what picture shows,"Look at the picture. I see an adapter with 3 lines just like my headphones with mic. Look at my product and there are only 2 lines. Only for audio. Not what I wanted and not as described. UPDATE: Customer service was great. After hearing of my issues they got back to me and promptly shipped the correct item. Unfortunately, that one was not compatible with my phone (no stereo and no mic). They then refunded my purchase."
3,Very simple.,"Very simple product. Feels a bit cheap but you get what you pay for. So far it works fine, but don't expect it to last too long unless it stays in one place at all times."
1,Adapter,"Adapter did not work - they said it was due to issues with hurricane and would refund money and replace part. They did refund money but did not replace part! So, now I have no adapter for my phone. It was 20 minutes after I posted a bad review they called begging me to remove my feedback and they would stand up to product. Well I did remove it and they refunded my money but never replaced the part."
1,Warning: Does not work for Xbox mic chat,"I should first note if all you want to do is use this for a phone then this will work fine audio wise and you need not read any further.If, however, you are planning to use this for adapting a PC headset to work with an Xbox controller you're out of luck because it will not work for that purpose. Seeing as how this item is one of the top results that appears when searching for an Xbox 360 headset adapter I feel it is time someone posts a negative review so others are not mislead by this product and are not out $5 like myself for something of no use to me.Now if you simply want audio from the chat from live through your controller this may work though it would be distorted. Most importantly however, it will not feed any input into the controller however. Hence, you may be able to hear chat but no one could ever hear you."
1,Didn't work as advertised,I only get sound to one ear unless I pull the headphones plug partially out. I was trying to connect a smart phone to UE superfipro 5.
4,purchased for friend,I purchased this for a friend and they have not complained so I guess it works well. I would recommend it.
1,Didn't work on my Samsung flip phone,"I bought this adapter so I could use my new headset for my Samsung Smooth flip phone. When I tested it, I could hear the caller, but all he heard was static."
2,Works; just not for what I need,"I bought this so I could use my computer headset with an Xbox 360. The idea was to plug the audio feed of the headset into the tv and the microphone feed into this adapter and then to the controller. I live in a 4 man dorm and I thought it might be considerate. It does not work for this. I wasn't sure if it would, so I took a gamble. I use bluetooth with my cell phone, so I have no use for this product."
1,Only one channel in headphones...,"I'd be better off sticking the stock ear buds in my ear than using this cable. FYI, I have a Cingular 8125 Pocket PC... Maybe you'll have better luck."
1,Poor description,It should be noted that the adapter is 2.5 mm male to 3.5 mm female. It will not work with an iphone/
1,not good,"same as others .I bought this adapter for my mp3 player so that I can use my sony earphones. Unfortunately, this one did not work."
4,"good price, ok product",i ordered this on a friday and got it on tuesday the following week. shipping was suppose to be 5-8 business days.I bought this product to use one my phone so i would be able to play music in the car. it works fine but every now and again the music will go in and out because of the connection.overall good price for what you get
1,Doesn't work for my phone :(,"I was hoping I could use this adapter to listen to music or podcasts on my cheap phone (Samsung Stunt), no, it doesn't work. I took a chance, I know. Saw that it work with other Samsung phones and HOPED it would work for me, oh well."
2,"Can only use for 1 side of audio and voice,","Ok alot of these people are saying that the trick with this is to pull it out a tiny bit, and yes that works but the reason that is, is that it is only meant for 1 channel of audio in and 1 channel of voice out.. which is why there are two rings on the end of it.. if you want to get both audio channels you need one with 3 rings. I didnt even think about it until after i got it and can only listen out of one ear, if i pull it out half way i get both ears but it is still only the left channel of sound..so if you are wanting this adapter to listen to music then u need to get one with 3 rings on it.. this would be great for turning a set of ear buds with a mic on it into an xbox mic but not for listening to music."
5,great product,"Great product, small price. The adapter works great in my phone. It is not too big and makes it easy to use while walking. Great product for anyone with multiple music product, easy change outs."
2,Low volume,The problem with this product is the fact that the volume is set very low.On my LG enV3 I turn the music volume all the way up and I can't hear it.The seller was fast however. That was the reason I gave it two stars and not one.Do yourself a favor: Don't buy this unless you enjoy low volume.
4,truly a stereo adapter - works for LG env3,"I wanted a spare adapter but the Motorola OEM model cable is no longer available. I bought a different brand and it turned out to only play music in mono. This no-name adapter cable has the same dimensions as my original Motorola one.Worked fine although the jack feels a little loose going into the headphone port of my cellphone. With this adapter, I could hear music coming out of both sides of my ear buds. Recommended."
1,It doesn't work,"I bought this adapter for my Blackberry Pearl so that I can use my Shure earphones for it's MP3 player. Unfortunately, not all adapters are universal, and thus this one did not work."
2,Does not meet my needs,"I purchased this item with the belief that it would support voice and audio (bi-directional). Fortunately it only cost a couple of dollars, because its only good for listening not talking."
2,Does not look like the picture,"The item I received looked a lot likeUniversal 2.5 Male to 3.5 Female Headphone/Adaptorand it did not have the three rings on the 2.5mm end that signifies it can be used for voice communication. Just make sure you check, I was able to contact the seller and get a refund however it took a while for me to diagnose the problem."
2,"Cheap, temporary.","First of all let me say that I purchased this product to convert my PC mic into an Xbox 360 mic. While talking to my friends through Party Chat, they were able to hear me (although unreliably), however I was unable to hear their voices at all through my headset, and had to settle for the television audio.This part is cheap. It transmits one way audio, and is very touchy. However, I must say that shipping was very quick, and I cannot complain about the part's quality because I took a chance on it after reading countless negative reviews.My advice: Search for a different part, and always make sure to take in account the reviews. If you're looking at this part in terms of an Xbox 360 adapter, I would consider finding a cheap headset, I've found countless great deals on this website, all you have to do is search :)."
2,Did not work with my device.,"It was a gamble going in. Some reviews stated that it worked some, not so much. In my case the adapter carried the voice to my phone but my voice did not make it out. For a few bucks it was worth a try. By the way, my phone is a SCH-U640 Samsung Rugged Duty Flip phone."
5,Love me some Classic Ronnie Laws!,This is classic Ronnie Laws blending jazz and funk and groove with some of the best tenor and alto saxes and alto flute with a funky back-beat and bg vocals...man check it out!
5,2003 Mazda MPV serpentine belt,"This belt is for my 2003 Mazda MPV with the Ford 3.0L V6. The original belt lasted 180K miles, and still looked pretty good, but the water pump belt was looking rough, and we had the summer vacation coming up, so I felt it was time to replace both belts. The pulley was replaced at the same time.Be sure to take a photo or carefully diagram the path of the belt, so that it goes back on as easily as it comes off. The whole project (both belts and a pulley) took less than an hour. It's a perfect fit."
4,"Really good case, but one little thing.....",I ordered this as a replacement for an old Case-Mate case and it fits my phone very well without adding any bulk size to it. it did interfere with my screen protector that was installed so i might need to get a case friendly screen protector in the near future. the one thing that i am concerned with is that the white part of the case is absorbing the color of my clothes. its not a big deal to me but i just wanted to post that.
5,Fun,"Got this fun Rope for my BF's family's dog, she loved it! She wouldn't let it go! and had so much playing tug of war!And -- It was Chanukah colored, perfect for the holiday!"
5,Great in Layman's terms,Highly recommended. I just bought a new iMAC and had zero experience with Tiger or Apple software. I like the way the author keeps your interest with sometimes dull materiel. Hard to put it down.
2,"""Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies"" is for real dummies.","""Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies"" is for real dummies, but not for novices who want to learn how to use the Mac. Detailed technical information is interspersed with goofy blather making the book difficult to read, annoying to experienced users and novices alike."
2,10.4 for dummies,I am disapppointed in this book. I have been a mac user for 15 years and am currently using system 9.2. I just purchased a new computer with system 10.4 and eagerly awaited opening the book.I agree with many of the other comments that the book rambles. He also discusses topics without explaining it (such as home). I could not find a definition of it and it was not in the index. He used the word sidebars without explaining what they were or how to manipulate the folders within them.I found that I could not read more than a few pages and had to put it down. I was simply bored and was not getting that much useful info.It seems to be more worthwhile to just play around with the computer and try things.I enjoy authors who write with levity and can clearly explain the topic. I did not think his explanations of topics were succinct. I am on chapter 5 and cannot get myself to keep reading.
2,Not Much,"This is not ""for dummies"" Not very usefull for us trying to switch from windows over OS 10. This looked to me to be just something he wrote in a hurry on a Tuesday afternoon. No help for me sorry I spent my MONEY on this junk."
4,Bought for my 80-Year-Old Parents,This is the book for someone who knows virtually nothing about the MAC OS X Tiger operating system. My father uses it. He is 80 and not computer savvy but it's helping him may his way using his computer.
3,Mac OSX Tiger for dummies,"To be honest this book is a good help for those that don't know mac, but I was specting a little more information that keep me interesting in the book."
4,Early Woody.,"Play it Again Sam is not one of Woody Allen's best movies, and, for this reason, I can only give it four stars. However, all of his early movies have merit and worth in my opinion. There is a great deal of silly comedy in this film and the character of Bogey always comes along to give our hero advice that he does not have the style or flair to put into practice. Play it Again... is rough and jaggedy compared to the uniform excellence of Sleeper and Banannas, but it's still a good bit of fun. Seeing Allen outside of New York (it's set in San Francisco)is quite a novelty and the beauty of a young Diane Keaton won't be something viewers will soon forget."
4,FUNNIEST SCENE EVER...,"I'll admit that I'm a fan of Woody Allen's work, but I still think the scene in his apartment in which his friends introduce him to the blind date with whom they've fixed him up is the funniest movie scene ever! Woody tries desperately to appear cool, suave, and sophisticated...and of course fails as only he can. A must-see cinema moment."
4,Woody Allen when he was funny!!,you can get the specifics from other reviews. here is my take.This is the middle part of a tripple feature.First Watch Casablanca - it doesn't come any better than thatthenWatch Play it again Sam. the Bogart impersonator that talks to Woody does a good job. Woody is a movie buff. He plays a movie critic without any stretch. Diane Keaton is her awesome self. The dialogue with Casablanca as a reference is poignant and funny.ThenWatch When Harry Met Sally. You'll be glad you did. it also has references to Casablanca.
5,Rolling Over...,This book is excellent for people like me...life-long methodists that need to learn how and why it all started. I would think John Wesley is rolling over in his grave at the current state of the methodist church.
4,A very good read,"This is a must read for anyone seriously studying the full Christian life.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,Best CD Ever!!!,I found out about One Hit Wonder off of the short music for short people CD and I thought they where cool so I bought this CD and this CD is great. If you are a punk fan you have to buy this!!!! It is great.
1,A scam: I want my money back!,"There is absolutely nothing in these guides (I bought 2 of them!). Vincent Mao put up 6 to 7 pages of decriptive information that is available everywhere for FREE and charge $[$$] for this!In this volume, there are nine charts and tables which are barely readable on the PDF format. Regarding the substance, please do not ask me to comment on the few paragraphs. Here is a sample:""First off, the majority of your trades should be in the direction of the general market averages (S&P; 500, NYSE Composite, and Nasdaq). As the old saying goes, ""a rising tide lifts all ships."" Second, even in times of tough market conditions, money can't hide.""I am very disappointed.M -"
5,It truly is smart & simple,Excellent content that provides good direction on investing & also help to get organized.
2,not impressed,not impressed I expected something deeper. you can get this info just by using google with your question save your money
3,Only good for US citizens,"It may sound weird to say this book is only good for US people. Who said it would be good for international audience? Well... I live in Brazil, I've been reading about personal finance and I thought the book would be interesting and useful for me. Well, it wasn't. This book is full of recomentations for products and services that are available only in the US, and deals with mortgage and retirement practices that apply only to this country. The general tips are nice, but if you don't live in the US, you shouldn't buy it. Nobody told me that, so I'm telling you now."
1,More garbage from Quinn,"It's amazing that Quinn with her one fan and 75 aliases can create this much interest on a totally boring book. It has been said before and is worth repeating, Quinn is no authority on personal finance. Just ask the fools who followed her investment advice through the market crashes or her insurance advice and took a whipping.Quinn may be a nice person. But her advice is a joke. One positive thing is that Quinnis living proof that anyone, even with no knowledge of a topic can write a book and get it on Amazons top 100 siomply by getting one fool to create innumerable aliases and hype this stupid waste.Defintely belongs on the ""Golden Turkey"" award list."

3,"""Terminal Earth"" - Good CD but ""Hypertrace"" is better","This CD yet another great from Scanner, but I would rate their previous CD ""Hypertrace"" 10 stars. It is much better than this CD."
3,Nice ideas but I was looking for a garage plan/loft,"I thought the book was insightful for ideas on how to arrange items and colors in your loft. But as stated previously, I was looking for a garage/loft plan."
5,Intermatic Makes Great Products,I have had Intermatic lights with a 300W transformer in the past and this company does not disappoint. I bought these 35W lights along with another 300W transformer and everything works great. The light is 35W so do not expect a massive amount of light but rather accent light for trees and shrubs. I placed these lights about 15 feet from the woods and have a perfect accent without being blinded by excess light. For more light you will want the 50W lights which are great but definitely provide plenty of light so they may be overkill in the wrong setting. The 20W lights are better for accenting small trees and shrubs from a close distance. In approximately two years of using Intermatic lights I have had one bulb go out and never had trouble with the transformer.
5,A must!,"This cd was nominated for BEST ALBUM at Premios Lo Nuestro. It also spunned a top 10 hit on the BillBoard Hot Latin Tracks with Ya No Te Creo Nada! I also like No Llorare, Y Siempre, and No ha sido facil!"
1,I hope it will NEVER be in stock again nowhere!,"This product is REALLY bad...doesn't work at all, plus, it burned my skin! For the sake of your skin, don't use that product..."
4,A book to bring with to the ruins,"You will feel like a guide if you carry this book with you through the ruins. An excellent text for teaching the reader about the ruins to be visited. Does not make many allowances for the armchair traveler. You should buy and bring this book with you, it can be used to help plan a trip, but the enjoyment is having the information at hand and in detail in the field. Substantial number of black and white photos, drawings, maps, and color plates."

5,Good game,Good game! I got hooked on it the first day I played it! The only problem is that the first couple times you play it you will probodley fail! Don't give up once you start exploring you will figure the game out in no time.
1,Before you buy this ...,"The game is horribly designed. One of the first things you must do is place the airport runway, and you are required to do this without being able to zoom out far enough to see the ends. It gets worse from there."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved this game! You get to make an airport and stuff like that! That just amazes me of what you can do at one time!
1,A Large Dissapointment,I thought this game would be a very good simulation game but it isn't. It's very hard to figure out how to make planes land at your airport. I thought it was the worst simulation game ever. Soave yourself money and pass this one by!
4,"Quick review of ""Death Spiral""","Like the previous reviewer, I could not put this one down until I had finished it. Plot and setting are excellent.PI Leo McFarlin is an immensely likable sleuth.I hope the author writes more novels with this character.Highly recommended."
5,Un libro vital para conocer qué es la Reforma de Pensamiento,"Un libro básico. El punto de partida indispensable para todo aquel que desee conocer en profundidad los métodos y técnicas empleados por los grupos sectarios para captar y mantener a sus miembros.Además de ofrecer un análisis de este tipo de comportamiento, enseña la manera de proceder cuando un ser querido está involucrado en alguna organización para poder ayudarlo.Este libro es indispensable en la Biblioteca de cualquier persona relacionada directa o indirectamente con miembros de sectas tales como la ICOC."
1,SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG,"Forgive me for disagreeing with this book's many content-free, clearly-cropped back cover quotes, but this is not a serious effort by any intelligent measurement. Hassan's prose is plodding and devoid of any nuance or invention. It's no wonder this one was self-published. Where's the insight? DO NOT waste your time on this one. Relevant subject matter has been trampled on with half-coherent, pseudo-expertise. I want my money back."
5,This is my favorite book to recommend to people who want to learn about cults,"This book presents a practical approach to planning an intervention when you have a loved one in a cult. Mr. Hassan's style is compassionate, never condescending and healing for anyone who was ever in a cult. I appreciated what he shared about his own experiences in and leaving a cult. I found it encouraging that he now has embraced the religion he grew up in, Judiasm, as for so many of us who leave cults it becomes impossible to not view anything spiritual with suspicion.I cannot say enough about what a great book this is. It doesn't matter which cult you are dealing with, he does an excellent job of helping the reader see its really all the same phenomenon. This book really is a must read."
3,Surprisingly Good Set,This item contained a surprisingly good collection of movies featuring Barbara Stanwyck. A good purchase for her fans. The only drawback was the visual quality of the discs. These movies were not remastered.
1,irritating,"Sorry, I did not enjoy this particular CD. The music was unorganized and at times seemed out of key. There was no real flow to it. Very haphazard. I was hopeful it would get better as it continued, but as it turns out, I didn't listen till the end. I had enough."
2,"Great expectations, but...","This one should have been the jewel in the crown of the Granada television series, since ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" is the best of the Conan Doyle novels. Unfortunately though, this movie is not:Suspense Q-marks are dutyfully ignored, the pace is to slow, the ghost isn't frightening and Jeremy Brett appears old, tired and fat.By the way, where's the deerstalker? I know Holmes didn't always wear one -however erroneously portrayed that way in every Sherlock Holmes movie you've seen, as if he were hunting ducks in the middle of London (the series' eye-for-detail rightly avoids this mistake)- but in THIS adventure in particular, it was THE attire to wear! Instead, Holmes wanders through the moors in a fedora. What a letdown!Nevertheless, I'm a big fan of the series and I think Brett was the best Holmes ever!"
2,Little disappointing,"I purchased this one, since I appreciated Jeremy's Brett's episodes of Sherlock Holmes. However, feature length ones did not do justice to the story of Sherlock Holmes. I would not purchase this one unless you really like this one. Too much variation to the storyline, too."
5,A must have,"Low price, great entertainment, and Jeremy Brett to keep you on suspense.Make some coffee, poor some good malt, have some Swiss chocolate and place yourself in front of the screen...Ahh...."
3,Only for the completists--save money and cherry-pick.,"I'd recommend cherry-picking the ""fourth-season"" 1988 episodes, ""Hound"" and ""Sign,"" and purchasing them individually, rather than obtaining this set. The other three ""movies"" are from 1991 (after ""Case-Book"" and before ""Memoirs""), and were the first episodes done after John Hawkesworth and Michael Cox had left as producers of the show and the faithfulness to the original stories fell dramatically: just as an indication, all three of these movies had their plots altered so much from the Doyle stories that the writers changed their titles (none of the other episodes had this happen). The only reason to purchase this set is to save money if you're a completist who needs ALL the episodes, or if you're a British-actor fan who doesn't care about script quality or Holmesian faithfulness."
4,feature film collection,Jeremy Brett and the rest of the crew have done a wonderful job on this whole Sherlock Holmes series. The purchase of this particular set I left for last since I knew by the reviews it was the lowest rated and I agree with this assessment. Thus I gave it a 4 star rather than a 5 star rating.
3,A different slant on a classic story.,"It is my opinion that this teleplay focused more on the ""human interest"" of the story and less on any supernatural suspense.Any great work of literature can disappoint when pictured, because after all, we form our own thoughts, and picture it in our heads. So here, the tragedy of the escaped killer's real story and the rescue of the young lady at the end, come to the fore; as opposed to the focus on the hound...which is slightly disappointing, admittedly. Although, that aspect was handled well, and does retain some suspense, as we fear for Baskerville walking across the moor at night. I'm a staunch fan of this Sherlock, but it seems the novelettes didn't come off as well.I recommend this as entertaining, as long as you approach it as a retelling with a touch of heart."
2,not what I was looking forward to,I expected the version that was broadcast on PBS Masterpiece a few years back. No such luck; I am quite disappointed. I would only recommend this to someone to did not see the original.
4,The Hound of The Baskervilles isn't the best,This film starring Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke is pretty good. I thought it got a little boring after awhile. Jeremy Brett has definately been in better movies of the series. All in all it is a great film for the era. The series was proably one of my favorite things of the era (1980's- 1990's).
3,Disappointment...!,"The Hound of the Baskervilles is the greatest case from the Sherlock Holmes series in the paper format by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, As far as Granada TV is concerned they have given the right justice to the Sherlock Holmes character by forwarding a great Artist Late Mr. Jermy Brett in leading role. I am the fan of Brett as and Holmes. He is the best holmes I ever seen.This VHS gives me a very disappointing experience considering Brett's performance (may because of his health), Horrifying environment on moor, All character (except Dr. Watson) especially Henry Baskerville, Stepelton and his sister (they are all just nonsense), Director is lacking in all fronts. The Dog is not looking as terrible as it should. The movie is bit slow and not apealing though I am the fan of Brett and Sherlock Holmes."
1,A Dog,"A true disappointment, since Jeremy Brett was at one time an arresting and original Sherlock Holmes. But this episode signaled that something had gone terribly wrong with this series: its a miserably acted and directed charade that captures nothing of the novel's drama and suspense. And Brett, in the first throes of the heart disease that would eventually kill him, looks dreadful and is almost inaudible. Put this thing side-by-side with the wonderful ""Hound"" of 1939 (with its stylish recreation of the Victorian era) and you'll see how superior Basil Rathbone was -- dynamic, glamorous, and almost gleefully self-assured."
3,Not a Great Reference Material,"The book was well written, organized and addressed the 50 most common hittings faults. The book would not make a good reference material for an on-goign student of baseball hitting. An index listing the symptoms of the most common faults and referencing the page number of the fault and drill to correct would have been extremely beneficial."
5,must read,If you coach youth baseball you need to read this book. This book will help make you a better coach and your team a winner.
4,Caveat for amateurs,"The equipment looks very nice. I haven't been able to use it yet because I am waiting for an optical cable which had to be purchased separately (found a seller on Amazon.) The manual states you can only use a 3 foot length optical cable (go figure - I ordered a 6'). It comes with standard RCA type audio cables.The equipment also requires special CD media. HHB was kind enough to ship one in the box. The recorder will not work with high speed (anything over 12x) CD's. The recorder burns at 1x. I read another review from someone who thought the machine was very slow. Well, it is, but it is archival quality and pretty much assures your recording will play on any commercial CD player. The recorder will record on RW CD's but the manual states that these CD's will not be recognized by many commercial CD players. You are pretty much confined to buying HHB CD media to use in this recorder."
1,Definite problems...,Eventually this stopped working. I was informed that I need to use slower CDs...still had the same problem...eventually bought a Marantz.I'll sell my hhb cheap...
2,limited recording ability,"the HHB 830 manual claims that a wide range of CDR will record properly. But a January 05 update warns that consumer data CDs don't work well, may DAMAGE the laser; and will VOID THE WARRANTY.Too late i learned the update. So many cd failures. Friend of mine has had NO such problem with the previous hhb model 800. Basically this current 830 is a LEMON design that will use only a narrow range of 'slow' cd media. If the first reviewer is correct, even 32x 'music only' may be too fast. Try finding 24x anywhere but from hhb! Also, TASCAM sez its 900 model works with 52x. So skip the HHB."
2,Missing the Point?,"Virginia Abernethy's attempt to form an understanding of problems felt in the US regarding population growth misses the point on several levels. Her continual blame of immigration and putting forth of Buchanistic ideas revolving around an ""us versus them"" mentality border on racist.The book has its place, but the reader must be aware that it concentrates much emphasis on negativity towards those with different skin and cultural background. Also, she states clearly that there is no global population problem. The problem only exists in the US. Open your eyes Mrs. Abernethy, take a look around the world, do some traveling!But where she really misses the boat is in her fear that US emphasis on multi-culturalism may lead to Kosovo like problems. Quite the contrary, multi-culturalism is all about living together as one nation/one-world, not separatism as she appears to be preaching."
1,Finally figured it out!,"7/09 Update. I finally got on a chat session with someone from Cables To Go. Apparently you have to change resolution settings on your PC. With some trial and error, the bf finally figured it out. However, the display does not use the full TV screen. The computer uses about 1/2 of the screen. But it's still bigger than my 20"" monitor. I do wish the full 46"" of the TV screen was used for viewing though.All in all a good buy. I wish there were some instructions that came with the cable though. I'd now give the product 4 stars.--------------------------------------This came with no instructions and I cannot find anything online. Unfortunately, neither my boyfriend nor I can get this to work on our Sony Bravia TV. :("
1,"only if you have a tiny, mellow dog","...otherwise this is a total waste of money. This lasted, literally, less than 5 minutes with my two dogs. The second one of them got it to herself, she chewed right through it. That part actually only about 15 seconds."
5,Biography Chuck Norris dvd.,Thank You ever so much. Just can't get this item in the United Kingdom. You've made me very happy indeed.
4,Biography of Chuck Norris,"I purchased the biography of Chuck Norris as a Christmas present for my son. He is a big time fan of Chuck. He informed me there were a few flaws in the video, but nothing that kept him from enjoying it as a whole. I would still recomend this to any Chuck Norris fan, to add to your collection. I ordered this thru Amazon, it is made upon order request.Sally O. of Michigan"
5,Soothing,"I love this cd, it's relaxing and can sooth the mind. My dogs love it too......cranking their heads to listen!!"
4,Good Thrasher Despite The Funk Tunes !!!,"Good release from Bay Area Thrashers.This is a solid release with some great songs and production is excellent as well.I like this record, but could've done without the funky songs and the Rick james cover ""super freak"".But the other songs on the cd are solid thrashers especially Spellbound and Sever and Splice which is from they're first demo. In my opinion this is the best and only Mordred cd you need."
4,rockabilly more physco less,It comes along way to a great CD as revival. When you thank a band is used up they go back to there roots and bring back a great CD. Every song seems to have a meaningful piece in life. using the OLE cough when you call in sick to work or losing a loved one the CD is the best work the band has every put out. A bit less frantic a little bouncy with the standup. But that is what good OLE Texas rockabilly is about.
5,Great Political Philosophy,"A great look at the way certain symbols (speeches, monuments, history ...) influence Democratic behavior in society. These symbols or veils are looked at from a number of angles that provoke serious contemplation of the nature of liberelism and autonomy.Professor Wingo also introduces the concept of actually manipulating these symbols in order to achieve a desired Democratic behavior.This book presents an important philosophical argument in a well-organized and easy to grasp fashion. A great accompaniment to any study of history and politics."
3,Good basic work shoe,"I picked a pair of these up due to the price, less than $25.00. They run a little big for the size, but basically have good construction, particularly the sole. Not much styling, but if your not in the office one hundred percent of the day and stroll through production or assembly, these are a decent buy. Like the brand illustrates, the are basically ""hoof covers""."
2,Plain but Comfortable,"Faux leather won't take a shine, but they are comfortable just for factory work or times you want to dress down."
1,Smells No Hair Removal.,"I bought this hoping it would work. I Race in Cycling competitions so it would save my legs from another razor hopefully. I followed the directions, had it on for the maxium amount of time and it didnt work at all. I tried again in a different area after letting my hair be softened with warm water for a while. Still DIDN'T WORK.It smells terribly. definitely not a good sport smell. unless the sport smell is sweaty jock-strap.I dont have sensitive skin and it didn't bother me but it certainly DID NOT WORK AT ALL.Ill stick to the women's razors instead. or maybe try waxing but who knows.The only plus is that it was shipped to my house really fast. That is what the 1 star is for.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. DIDNT WORK AT ALL AND SMELLS HORRIBLE."
5,Don't neglect behavioral sciences,"This book is easy, concise and comprehensive. Most people ignore behavioral sciences because it is easy and ""low yield"" but that is their fatal mistake on the test. There are a significant number of behavioral questions and mastering this book WILL raise your score. The book is so short that it is worth going over at least once."
5,Great Behavioral Science book,This is a must have to review for behavioral science. Dr. Fadem does an amazing job condensing everything into this book!
3,just OK,"this book is not a bad study guide. it has a lot of MCQs to help your review. personally, i preferred the rapid review behavioral science"
4,Sandra Oh rocks in this small gem of a film. . .,"""Double Happiness"" is not an earthshattering, groundbreaking film--but damn, it's good. Especially the wonderful Sandra Oh (Christine on ""Grey's Anatomy""), who is a delight. She doesn't play a hardnosed, sharp-tongued character here--like she does very well on TV--instead she delivers a warm, appealing performance as a young woman caught between her family's strict values and her longing to break free and enjoy life. Not that she's miserable living at home with Mom and Dad and Sis--they have fun together--but she wants to be an Oscar-winning actress, and her parents don't see this as a proper career. All the actors are outstanding--and there are many great scenes--especially when the song ""MacArthur Park"" is unexpectedly introduced and also when Sandra discovers the truth about her handsome date. If you like Sandra Oh, you'll enjoy this film."
3,not doubley happy,"i saw bits and pieces of this movie, and w/sandra oh, i thought it would be one of those feel good movies,but it not. i recommend renting the movie, but not buying it."
5,Sandra Oh rox!,"I've been waiting a while to be able to get this on DVD, and I'm glad I was finally able too. Had this on my DVR for a while, but lost it when I had to return it to the cable company. This is a really good movie, and Ms. Oh, as usual, shines. I'd pretty much recommend any of her movies, however there are a lot of movies where she has a really small part, which is disappointing, but generally they're still worth a look. The bigger her part, the better the movie, as a rule, but I might be biased...""Long Life, Happiness and Prosperity"" is also one of my faves, and definitely worth seeking out."
3,Sandra Oh makes this movie watchable,"I got it because it stars Sandra Oh, who I really like. It's about a young woman trying to find the balance of making her Chinese parents and herself happy. Of course, it's an impossible feat. Haven't most of us tried it in our youth? She dates a Chinese guy her parents set her up with to make them happy but sees a white guy who makes her happy.One line that cracked me up was Oh's father called white people ghosts. I thought of the movie White Man's Burden staring John Travolta and Harry Belafonte. It was a movie where Black people oppressed whites and one racial slur was ghosts. BTW, that wasn't a bad movie either.I couldn't help but think of the hilarious Margaret Cho and her imitating her mom. No, the movie isn't as good as watching Cho but it's a decent time wasting movie."
4,Casting of the Hunger Games,"I enjoyed watching this excerpt of the casting for the movie.The movie was captivating enough but the selection by the director,I felt was ""spot on""."
2,Meh,Over hyped. Typical teens know more than adults and will ultimately save the world. A bunch of Any Randian whohah nonsense thrown in for good measure. Meh.
1,No food here,Many people like this but I am not one of them. I thought the book poorly written and the fact that so many teens like it so much distrubing. Not a happy read. Gets less than one star.
5,Great book,A great book that was better than the movie. I enjoyed reading the series.Would recommend to all that like to read.
5,great mood,"great album by Ilybicd, dark mood, good performace, good songs especially the ghost & lets ride together"
5,AWESOME!,"I have never heard any of the songs by this band but this is the greatest record of all time based on the name of the band alone. I will die happy knowing that these boys are fighting the good fight. Oh, man..."
4,Noir writer's bio.,"Excellently crafted bio of paperback and Hollywood noir writer of the '40-'60sDavid Goodis, by the son of Goodis' ex-wife, himself a professional video producer. Interviews with family, friends, academics and collectors and visual documentation relating to an author whose ""archives"" have been notoriously scant."
1,Global Star Un-American,"This Canadian company has produced some of the WORST games as far as hardware compatablity is concerned. In fact I have not been able to get a single Global Star game to run on my system.Further, In some of there previously games the games themselves high marks (Global Star's editorial review) for accuracy of the platforms (fighters). And what do I see there an imaginary Mig-42 (it has not been even designed yet). The flight envelope of the F-35 has not been fully explored and is still classified just like the F-22. So how does this Company think IT knows the performance envelope of these fighters.I seriously doubt this game will not have the same issues as previous games by this company. The company recommends a NVidia GeForce Card so this might resolve some compatablity issues. No NVidia GeForce video card? Don't buy the game."
5,Best worship CD of the year!,This CD is awesome! There is just the right mix of fast and slow songs to really get you in the mood to truly praise and worship God.
4,Excellent Album,"I loved the soulfulness of Daude's album, which was done in a similar vein to great, American artists like Lauryn Hill. Although there are some Afro-Brazilian songstresses singing on the Brazilian charts, it's nice to hear one unafraid to express pride for her roots.Daude combines the best elements of hip hop (with not only beats, but its activism), samba reggae and Blocos Afros for truly beautiful songs that are a blend of Brazil and American beats. My favorites off this album were ""Uma Neguinha,"" ""Crioula,"" ""Il Aye (Que Blocco E Esse)"", ""E Foi Mamae Me Disse,"" and ""Naja"". I also liked her fun, rhythmn and blues make over of ""Canto De Ossanha"".This is one of my favorite Brazilian albums, which gets constant play. It's off Peter Gabriel's Real World label. It's been a while since Daude put out an album, and I can only hope she'll do one soon in the future."
1,Fun Movie; Poor Transfer,"Ok; I remember this movie fondly. I still love it...and have the poster on my wall at home. But the DVD...I'm so disappointed. The quality is incredibly poor. The picture is grainy, and tends to have the 'cross-hatching' artifacts of over compression. The print itself had scratches that have been preserved for all time....how very sad. Frankly the quality is comparable to a 2nd generation VHS copy...even the one at your local rental store is likely to be better. Oh; and I recall someone else mentioning that the DVD is Mono! He explains that far better than I can. Well, all in all: Do Not Buy The DVD! If the studio doesn't care enough to put some resources into releasing the DVD of this flick, why should they reap any further profit from it?"
4,What can really be said here?,"If you like 80's B movies, this is right up your alley. Shannon Tweed does keep her clothes on to the disappointment of many, but the laughs are worth a watch. Seriously, this flick is fun and funny."
3,"Movie Is Great, DVD - Questionable.","I love this movie. The comedy may be getting a little dated these days, but 'tis still great. I had been trying to get a copy on videotape for years, but now that it is available on DVD I was super pleased!The actual DVD however is kind of a let down. It's great to see the trailer. And the menus are nice. But I suppose I was looking for a little bit more in regards to a wider screen, but it's just set to normal full screen. Still a great classic for the collection if you like these kinds of flicks."
1,A gruesome guacamole...,"And not because it's about feminist cannibals.This movie is one of the WORST parodies.In its attempts to be funny,it's not even funny.Bill Maher plays the Archetypal Insensitive Male,reading his lines as if he had the script right in his hands.Luckily,he has moved onto Bigger and Better Things.Whew!The premise,while interesting,ends up unfunny.Next to ""Wild Wild West"",this is one of the most unwatchable movies I've ever seen.Terrible acting,terrible music,I gave up after the first half hour.If you want to dip into guacamole,skip this film."
5,"A ""politically incorrect"" look at feminism by Bill Maher","Taking the plot of Apocolypse Now, Maher has looked at the history of Feminism in a very funny way...From a tribe of male subserviant pot holder makers called the Donahues to Bunny dressed in Pink it is a triumph"
2,Horrible....but hilarious,"In order to sum up this whole DVD, I'd say never buy it. But then buy it for the hell of it anyways.'Cannibal Women' is absolutely horrible in every way. From the dramatic music as men with boxers on their heads learn of beer, to the hippo fight that never shows a hippo due to budget constraints, to the tagalong bimbo that dreams of being tied up in twizzlers, this movie is a perfect example of a 'B' movie. It's horrible, it's hilarious, and never (or always?) get it."
1,would not play - twice,"As I mentioned when I returned this dvd the second time, it would not play. I suggested pulling it from your inventory. Not to pleased to discover you still carry it."
3,Great Movies,This product came quickly & was packaged well. The movies all worked well. However the box it came in fwll apart one i opened it. So I needed to put each movie in seperate cases.
3,"Expected a better product but for the price, I'm not complaining",It's hard to see the floating thing that answers questions. I've seen easier to use 8 balls.
2,"The ""predicitions triangle"" inside ... you can't read it.",I bought this for my niece because she loves to play soccer so I thought this would be fun for her. I tried it when it arrived and you can't read the predictions part because it never lies flat enough to come across the glass. It's almost like the triangle inside stays on its edge along the glass. I am very disappointed in my purchase.
3,OK - know why it's discounted.,"The little floating thingy with the answers appears to have lost some air, or just doesn't 'float' as well - some answers are very hard to see. If you can 'keep asking' then you're fine."
5,Limited purpose tool keeps computer keyboards and mice clean,"This won't suck up the dust bunnies hiding inside your computer case because it isn't designed to do that.Instead, this little tool is intended to replace cans of compressed air, puffy brushes and just turning over your keyboard to clean it.And it performs this task well, in addition to cleaning dust off other items such as cameras, mice and small things in general.The DataVac PC comes with two brush tips that provide sufficient versatility to swiftly and thoroughly clean that messy keyboard.While not essential to your life, the DataVac PC is a nice gadget to have around, especially when your keyboard looks as mine does all too often.Jerry"
2,Able but not powerful,"This vacuum will suck the dust out of your PC but only right at the nozzle. It doesn't move enough air to pull stuff any further away like a full-size vacuum would do. I like its size, though, and it is pretty quiet. I also like that it is powered by AC and is not battery powered. If it were, it would probably be even more anemic."
1,Didn't work,"This DVD did not work and I had to return it to the USA, cost 12 dollars ..... Am hoping to have my money returned."
5,All four are Jack Lemmon classics,"You can't go wrong with this package of four Jack Lemmon classic movies. ""Some Like It Hot"" is on virtually every serious movie critics top 10 movies of all time. ""How to Murder Your Wife"" is not an inappropriate title and may give some of you ideas, but once you see Verna Lisi you will understand that there is not way he could have done it (that is not a spoiler)! ""The Apartment"" is a wonderful little love story co-starring Shirley MacLaine in her gorgeous prime. ""Avanti,"" filmed in Italy and cast with an assortment of talented Italian actors, is both witty and endearing. I hesitated buying this set as I already owned ""Some Like It Hot,"" but I am glad I did. It is the only time I have doubled up on a film, but it was worth getting the other three at a bargain price."
5,one of my favorites,I have been using this product for yeasr ..that is why I searched and purchased this item in particular....they are well made ..comfortable and never fail !
3,Not a good buy unless you are using it for a bb gun!,"This sling would be o.k. for a very small gun or a toy, but not for a average sized weapon. I bought this for a AR-15, and I knew right away I should have spent the extra bucks to get better one. It's not worth dropping an exspensive weapon due to a cheap sling."
4,Great value,"My RAA Saiga rifle has 1-inch sling swivels, and this sling fits them perfectly. It's a great, low-cost solution and it's much more comfortable than a plain 1-inch nylon sling. In fact, I liked the price so much I bought three of them. I'll probably put one on my SKS in place of the plain military sling. (For ARs, I'd prefer 1.5-inch webbing.)"
4,4 stars,"I give this game 4 stars. It is overall very fun and I love the setting. I want to be a vet and I love the game because of that. Most games are boring but I love this and it never gets boring. This came has pretty good graphics and the sounds are awsome. This came can never be beat, but you stop getting new animals once you complete it. You have to fix all animals the same way, bet you deal with teeth, eyes, bones, heart beat, cuts, ticks, and much more. Overall this came gets a four star."
3,"Good, but can get repetitive","I agree with one of the reviewers above. I bought this game for a 6 year old who has more than above average intelligence and she quickly became bored of the game, due to it's repetitive puzzles and lack of a real storyline. The graphics are nice and the info is mostly accurate but like has been said before, there are limited ways to ""fix"" the animals and no variation. So much more could have been done with this game but as it is, it's really limited."
3,Not for my 6 year old,I purchased this for my daughter on her 6th birthday and while the game is cool and she loves it it is only for children that can read well on their own. There is a lot text to read and it is NOT read aloud by the game. Rated E for everyone but definitely don't buy it for your little one until they can read independently.
1,lay reader,"Bushit, is a great fiction book. It provides a lot of opinions, and allows people to disregard reality, while allowing speculation and Hippie mentality to dominate the book and influence the opinions of the average person.In reality, the book has very few factual references, and refers most of the time to Opinion Editorial pages from questionable sources. The only references in the book are opinion based. No real facts are cited.If one wants a fictional account of Bush's evils, then by all means buy the book. If one wants reality, bypass this one!J C Gummgumm29@aol.com"
3,He is not P. J. O'Rourke,"I bought P.J. O'Rourke's ""Eat the rich"" Amazon refered this book to me. If you want a comple reversal then this is the book. Otherwise nothing in common. I had to rate it so I gave it a neutral 3 stars. Yes I am biased and would not want my political opinion to influence the rating"
2,Bummer!,"I have always been pleased with Let's Go books, and in fact, seek them out when ever I travel. This book was a disappointment! I couldn't find any of the suggested places to stay or eat and all of the places to visit always cost about $10US dollars more than the book said they would cost. England is a good sized country with so many cool historical monuments and towns and because they packed Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England into one book, none of the countries got any focused time and besides, London got top billing with some 50 pages! Overall, I felt like no one bothered to update prices or explore very many options nor had any of the contributing editors spent a great deal of time there. I recommend you seek another budget travel guide."
3,Size runs a little big,This is a nice costume (my son loved it) but the size seems to run a big (did not fit my son) and many stores that sell costumes will NOT accept returns or charge out the wazoo in restocking and return shipping fees. WonderCostumes does not accept ANY returns during the month of October for any reason!!!! So keep that in mind and check the seller profile and return policy before ordering.
2,"Not the ""Classic"" Wüsthof Knives","After purchasing this item, I realized there are different varieties of Wüsthof knives. The ""Classic"" and ""Grand Prix"" are made from forged steel, where as the ""Gourmet"" series is stamped from a sheet of steel. They look more cheaply made and while I'm sure they are good knives, it's worth your money to have one amazing knife, as opposed to 10 good knives. Thankfully the seller was great about accepting my return. Also of note: the shears were left out of the shipment, likely just a fluke, but make sure you count the pieces when your package arrives! Also, the knives arrived in a 17-slot block, not the 9-slot block mentioned in the description."
1,Surprised that Wusthof makes such a low quality set,"We just got these knives for our wedding and were so excited to be the proud new owners of a set of Wusthof knives. What a disappointment we had when we pulled them from the box. These sheet-metal knives look like they'd snap at the very sight of a raw carrot. These knives bent easily, looked cheap and were immediately returned to their box. We plan to stick with Wusthof, but are going to return these and pay the extra for a good set of Classics or Culinars.It's understandable that Wusthof (or any company) wants to provide products for entry-level buyers, and apparently this was the only way to reach this price point. But, after seeing these and reading a couple of reviews, it seems a waste of very good money for knives that don't look like they'll make it through the holidays, muchless years to come.Save your money and invest in their forged steel!"
3,Something for the rookies,"This book is intended for javascript beginners. Although basic javascript is examined, javascript1.2 is explained in detail with a complete list of objects together with their properties and methods(very useful). I learned a small trick i have never seen before. if you are on your first steps go for it!"
2,Not for learning,"I bought this book and I found out that this is not for learning. The first 130 pages focus on making JavaScript forms. And rest of it is reference section. Do not buy this book if you will use it as a main book for learning JavaScript, but I recommend this book if you will use it as a companion of another book or two."
1,Save your money. Read the Netscape Reference instead.,"What a bunch of hype. If you want to make javasript forms, this book may help. Otherwise, it's a total waste of time. The examples suck. It's illogically constructed and useless to graphic designers already using Dreamweaver or CyberStudio. It reads like the Netscape reference manual. In fact, you'd be better of going there. END"
1,A DISGRACE TO THE SERIES,"This book falls far below the standard of other Dummies books I have. All those reviewers who say it is badly explained without due thought for beginnners are right. The writer suffers from the disgusting disease of explaining to people who already know what is going on. This is the disease Dummies books claim to cure. Ha!! I wrote to IDG, the publishers of the Dummies books, with details and examples of bad, unclear explanations. A form letter said they would reply later. They never did. I want my money back!!"
2,"JavaScript, NOT FOR DUMMIES","Uhh, i've been writing javaScript for money for years now. When i saw that my usually intelligent roomate was having trouble learning this easy language, i decided to look into it. I picked up this book, that he had been using and i found his problem immediatley. I looked over the first few chapters, and even i became confused. The beginning (most important) chapters are horribly laid out and poorly explained. The author's attempt at humor is pathetic as well."
1,"Should be ""JavaScript BY Dummies""","I just bought the 3rd edition of this book, copyrighted in 2000. I wish I'd shopped here and read the reviews first. It's painfully obvious that neither the author of the folks at IDG are reading customer reviews, because they repeated all of the mistakes in this version that people here have been complaining about for two years. In the opening pages the author keeps claiming she doesn't assume you know anything about JavaScript or HTML, yet she starts the book off by listing JavaScript and HTML code that can't possibly mean anything to you unless you already know something about the languages, and she refers to those code listings as thought they are self-explaining. She introduces abstract concepts in the very early stages, then refers you to the Appendixes for explanations, which in many cases don't exist!All said, a waste of money and time."
4,Good basics,"I think this book does a good job of explaining the basics of JavaScript for anyone who needs to get started using it. As the ""tag, you're it!"" webmaster of a small company with no prior programming experience I was able to figure out how to do mouse-overs and message alerts using the examples given in this book. I also thought that the author's explanation of HTML was complete enough to give a novice an idea of how web pages work. My only complaint is that the book is now a few years old, and I'm wondering when and if they are going to publish an updated edition."
4,Pretty good,"I have a few books on JavaScript, but if I ever have a question on JavaScript, I turn to this book first. My only complaint is that the book doesn't tell you whether something falls under JavaScript 1.0, 1.1 or 1.2. So you have to test your JavaScript in several different browsers to see which ones it works in."
2,Dont get this book......,This book needs some....organization.......i learned more about javascript by copying other scripts and changing em a bit and see wat is different....This book would only be used as a reference and its not so great there either....
1,You wanted a scrollbar didn't you?,"About 9 months ago, I decided I wanted to become familiar and maybe even develop a career in web site design. I first purchased a great book on how to design HTML. From that book I learned a lot of things, but when I had mastered the language, I wanted to know more. I searched and searched for a book that would help me learn Javascript in an introductory level. I figured a title like ""Javascript for Dummies"" would be great for a beginner like me. I was wrong. This book is useless. After the first time I read the book I was confused, so in a second effort I read it again. I was even more confused than the first time. This book gives no useful examples on how to use javascript except for HTML forms and jscript scrollbars. I have found no use or applicibility for the information provided by the author. I now know to stay clear of any ""dummy"" books."
4,Very helpful starter for learning JavaScript,"JavaScript for Dummies is a very useful book for GETTING STARTED. Although its purpose is to teach you the language, it really doesn't. That is, it doesn't do an outstanding job of it. I felt it focused way too much on form validation and JavaScript dealing with forms. In addition, the author made a few too many personal references. On the other hand, as all Dummies books go, it was fun to read and I did end up walking way with"
1,Not up to the reputation of the collection,"Javascript for dummies, by Emily Van der Veer, is not up to the reputation of clarity, simplicity and usefulness of the books in the ""For Dummies"" collection. The explanations of the basic concepts of the language (primary datatypes, objects, arrays, functions, properties, methods, etc.) are garbled and confusing. The examples are badly selected, they don't go step by step, they mix trite and complex elements, and do not really explain things. This book will delay by several years, as it did for me, your understanding of Javascript. I finally understood and began to be able to use the language after having read ""Javascript, the definitive guide"" by David Flanagan."
2,Not very good,"This book doesn't teach you, it just tells you. I bought this book thinking I would learn something. All I learned was some of things Javascript can do. Also, another negative note, she adds a lot of unnecessary (unappreciated; for that matter) blah! Not recommended."
1,I wish I read this before I purchased the book,"It is painful. I'm an X programmer and wanted to catch up on the newest programming craze, Java. After reading Javascript for dummies I felt like a dummy for buying this junk. No, I felt like a sucker."
2,Not a good book,"I bought the book but I found the flow of the material difficult to follow. I didn't feel that the concepts were well explained or that the examples were very helpful.Since I've programmed in several other languages, I was able to get things working in spite of the book's drawbacks. I wouldn't want to be a novice working from this book. For anyone, I'd recommend looking for a different beginner book."
1,I should have checked Amazon first....,"I just purchased ""JavaScript for Dummies"" and immediately became lost after Chapter 2. The author is horrible at teaching this language. Fortunately, I have a friend who is a VBasic programmer and helped me through parts of it. But I give up - I'm going to search for another JavaScript manual. This one is the pits and I am very, very, VERY disappointed that ""For Dummies"" even published this book! I have a deep urge to slap the tar out of the author."
1,Don't try to learn from this book,"While all of the information is in there somewhere, I found this book to be poorly organized and hard to follow. The author repeatedly introduces in-depth concepts without having yet explained the base concepts. Even though I have other programming language experience, I couldn't follow this book."
2,"""Dummy"" title is extremely misleading","I was very excited when I saw that the ""dummy"" series had tackled Javascript. I bought it w/o really much thought. BAD MOVE! This is not a book for beginners with JavaScript! The book does not have good explanations and I have not learned anything useful. (I have learned more useful things about JAVASCRIPT from a book I purchased last year about HTML!) The supposed-to-be-funny titles and subheadings in the book are really annoying because it seems that they are put in there to warrant the ""Dummy"" moniker. Extremely disappointing!"
2,The first Dummies book that made me feel like a dummy.,"The only reason I got this book was because the authors of Netscape Composer for Dummies (great book by the way) recommended it. Now I wish I had read ALL the reviews by the other customers. I understood everything perfectly fine up until chapter 3, then I became totally lost, and I'm not exactly what you would call a beginner. Vander Veer dives directly into the hard stuff, saying everything will be explained in later chapters. Well, I read the later chapters and I was still confused. The worst parts were the examples. Not only were they not explained thoroughly enough, but I had no idea how they related to anything. She defines what a method, event, and object are, but what do we do with them? Really disappointing."
1,Missed it,"Not to sound trite, but this book was written by Dummies.... the examples are not true to life, there are too many mistakes and the explaination of JavaScript is too complicated and overblown."
1,Dis Ain't de Book,"This is not a book for beginners, or even experienced programmers. You'll hate it. I don't know why computer authors can't write a book for the real world and give real world examples."
1,A terrible book!,"Do not buy this book, it's too old. It's actually using HTML that's outdated and not recommended anymore. Also, it's full of faults. Even in the very first code snippet there are major faults (even though it's the shortest code snippet available). Also, it's really boring and using too many words to explain the same things over and over again. I can't understand why I bought it, I should've checked the reviews. I won't trust the ""for dummies"" brand again."
3,"Not for novices, but lots of examples","Despite the ""for Dummies"" moniker, this book is not for ""...the Rest of Us!"". It is for those who already know some of the basics of object programming and want to add Javascipts to their arsenal of skills. The book is full of useful examples of popular features that can be easily customized. A CD is included that saves time in writing and building scripts. There may be better books for beginners out there, but this one does an adequate job of surveying the subject."
5,The Source of My Programming Knowledge,"This book is not only what taught me JavaScript, but computer programming as well. I continue to refer to this book today, years after I first read it. It has an amazing compilation of information, really simple to understand as are all dummies books that I've read."
2,never recieved the book,"I did not received this book, but they after I contacted them, I received a credit for my purcharse."
4,Not bad!,I got this to help someone out and it was the right for us. Easy to access and get a drive set.
5,collection,I collect Christmas pop-up books and this one will become a classic in years to come. It was delightful and I expect to enjoy it each Christmas.
5,Good CLA Product,"I have been pairing CLA with a good diet and exercise program. While I wont say that the weight is flying off me (which I don't think is the intention of this product) I do think it helps with appetite suppression. When I take 2 pills 15-30 mins before a meal, I feel fuller faster and more satisfied for longer periods of time."
2,Results?,"I did not see any results. :( But they were easy to swallow, and had no aftertaste. Claims to help burn fat, but that definitely did not happen."
3,Still waiting on results,"This product is touted as one of the newest forms of altering one's body composition, supposedly could take up to six months to see results. The jury is still out on this one."
3,Doesnt seem to work for me.,I tried this just on a whim but didnt see it doing much. I tried this for about 3 months at the proper dosage and didnt see much in terms of results. I am in good shape to start with so just wanted that last little extra push towards a 6/8 pack but didnt do anything. This may be more effective for someone who is over weight and/or obese <shrugs>
1,Bad Company,Company never did send my order...tried to call and would not return my call...tried to write them and still no answer....
3,good,"I like the games, but since there are over a thousand different types of games in the pack, you have to install each game individually and that is the part I don't like about it."
3,Question,I have more of a question than a review. I would like the list of games it has; Particularly Colors of War.
3,Copy Cat story of Summerfield,"This book smacks of the same plot and twists of one of her old books, Summerfield. There's a cabin, a puma, an infected leg, and you get my drift. Nonetheless, I enjoyed both books."
5,The King's Own,I enjoyed this book as much as I did Covenant. Both are excellent! Lorna Freeman continues a great series that I I've enjoyed reading more than once.
2,The 2nd book is grossly inferior to the first book!,"I loved the first book; it was one of the most original, entertaining, action-packed fantasies that I have ever read! The 2nd book is like a poor immitation of an emotionally wrought Barbara Hambly novel. Rabbit has learned nothing, and he is more of a victim than anything else. The book starts out promising but is soon bogged down in hopeless action after hopeless action against the evil demons. I so wanted to like it, but it really was a struggle to finish it. I won't give up on the series just yet, but this hard-to-find 2nd book is not worth the money that the used book dealers are holding out for."
4,not bad,"This is a good book, the style is very hard to comprehend and understand. Eventually you get used to it, overall it drags when it is not supposed to and goes through major events way to quick or just does not really acknowledge it and goes on with the story. The plot was good and that is the only reason it is getting four stars, if written a little better with more thought then yea it gets five stars."
4,Wow!!!!,"This book is quite different from the first. A lot darker, but absolutely worth reading. The story takes place over a few days and it all takes place in o-so quiet Freston, the garrison town where the first book finished. It is a pity that Suiden didn't play a bigger part in this book, but Rabbit has enough trouble on his own. Rabbit is detached from his unit to the king's own and seconded to the Lord Commander. Once again he has problems with magic and it seems that the people of Iversterre have problems with it (and him) as well. The story was worth waiting for. I bought the book yesterday and didn't go to bed until it was finished. Unfortunely it is not longer, I can't wait until the next one."
2,Poor quality video transfer but beautiful Maureen O'Hara,"I mainly bought this DVD because I absolutely love Maureen O'Hara and because I was curious about the film, ""Kangaroo"". Since it was very reasonably priced I figured 'nothing ventured, nothing gained' - so I'm glad I didn't pay more than a few dollars for it! The video transfers were from the worst possible film sources with tons of bad splices, missing dialog and poor picture quality. I was curious about ""Kangaroo"" because of the stories Maureen O'Hara told in her autobiography, "" 'Tis Herself"". She said it was a real ""stinkeroo"" (as she called it) and, by golly, it is! None the less, it didn't cost me much to find out for myself. I should've taken her word for it!"
4,had to have it,"had to get these movies incase I never find them again, picture quality is not to good ,buy what the the heck their old movies,glad just to see Maureen ohara!!"
1,???????,"I was forced to click on one star or be unable to submit this. My opinion is it would be helpful to know what movies are on this ""collection."" Borders/Amazon doesn't say."
2,"When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.","The main point of this book is there exists a core group of people in any organization. Their concerns are what really drive the company. Not the market, the business, or anything else. There is a club aspect to any business, no matter how people may want to pretend its something more slick/high tech. Plenty of anecdotes. The book has some merit. However, this book should be called ""Core Group is My Theory to Explain Everything"". I would bet over half of all the paragraphs in the book contain the phrase ""Core Group"". I wonder if the author has a copywright on the term or something. Maybe hes doing ""Core Group Learning Seminars"", for a fee. (Be sure to go to one and tell me how it is.) To sum up : Good anectdotes, not great book structure, massive repition of the term ""Core Group"". There are alot of management books out there. Just throw this onto the pile."
2,Not much new here!,I didn't find much new here that any average individual in the workforce couldn't figure out on their own. As a VP Sales and Marketing I was aware of most of the organizational dynamics addressed in the book.
3,destructible,"This is a cute book; however, it has pull tabs and appendages that can easily be ripped apart by youngsters. I have a one year old fighting for her independence that wants to pull all tabs herself. Therefore, upon our first reading, a nose and ponytail was ripped from the cute faces in the book. I'm sticking with more sturdy board books for this age."
4,Fun but not captivating,"The author does a good job of capturing the Doctor and Rose: They actually seem like Nine and Rose (I can think of only one moment that seemed out of character). The story is a good romp, and the secondary characters are convincing and kind of funny. But I am reminded why I don't normally read these books: zero character development. How can there be? The show's creators need all character development to happen on-screen, or it won't make sense to viewers."
3,It's a lot better then some of the other books,"This book isn't a bad read, it held my interest. The plot was okay, nothing exceptional but not bad. The Doctor and Rose where mostly true to their characters. There is a lot of parts that I found boring and the ending wasn't as epic as the endings of the shows. Still, it's a lot better then some of the other books out there."
2,"Lots of action, but it misses out on the character interaction","I'm in the throes of Doctor Who love, reading everything I can get my hands on, but this one disappointed. It may be partially due to my perspective (female, not a teen), but what really makes Doctor Who work for me is the relationship between the Doctor and his companion, and given that the two spend almost the entire novel apart in prison there is sadly little interaction between the two.The action is fine; I was not a huge fan of the Slitheen so their return didn't do much for me, but I did enjoy the Doctor's relationship with a research group of alien scientists - his immediate bond with them is utterly true to his character. And Rose's triumph over adversity is true to her character, as well... the book worked, but it just didn't give me what I wanted; ""Winner Takes All"" by Jacqueline Rayner is much superior."
3,Fun but not my favorite,"Rose and the Doctor are seperated. But unlike in the series where Rose takes the chance to solve the mystery of the alien's origins, delete all Dalek from existance or build an impossibly complicated machine to track down Donna Noble from multiverses away, in this story...Rose doesn't really do much. It's the Doctor's story and even he doesn't seem to be having much fun."
2,Tedious read,"I didn't care for this story or the writing style. It's tough to translate the magic of the screen into the written word, but this didn't really evoke the flavor of the series for me. Descriptions were flat, story-line wasn't particularly interesting. I found it flat."
4,Postal Inspectors or FBI?,"This is an interesting movie that covers a law enforcement agency that I knew very little about. Lou Gossett is excellent here as the seasoned veteran saddled with the still wet behind the ears Johnathan Silverman. It also touches on a very real danger of the times, with letter bombs and terrorism. Though well acted, it cannot help but become a little campy. In my mind that is not a detriment as it reminds me a lot of the better done cop tv shows. It also lets the film be watched on multiple levels much like Dragnet (the tv series not the movie). The sequel is even better, delving into the frightening realm of identity fraud."
5,bits of this/that make a fantastic movie,"First off, I'll admit that I bought this movie because my favorite actor plays the villain, but that's not why I keep watching it. Inspectors does an amazing job of pulling together all sorts of differing elements to make it so much more than just a mystery or an action flick. There is real depth and realism with the two leads being shown as actually having personal lives. There's also a bit of comedy to offset the crime scenes and despicable actions of the bad guys. The movie isn't very graphically violent. It hasn't been rated, but I would say that since the language isn't gratuitous and the movie doesn't have a front row seat to the effects of mail bombs on human anatomy, I'd let a 15 year old watch it with me. It's an outstanding movie with great re-viewing potential."
3,"It's okay, but...","I don't recommend this for a programmer. This book seemed to be a gloss over of XSLT and didn't probe too deeply into it. For that I recommend Michael Kay's excellent work XSLT.Basically I zipped through this book and wanted more - I wanted to understand what was going on and not just be able to do it. Kay's book provides that and much, much more."
2,"Light on details and useful examples, plus terrible index","This book left me a little high and dry. While it explained basic stuff about XSLT, and indeed did get me from knowing little to knowing a lot more, this book fell short once you had the basics. I come away feeling like XSL is both obtuse and difficult to use (perhaps this is an accurate assesment :-), but I feel that the author failed to offer specific details that would be important to help understand, and also didn't provide guidance on how to diagnose and resolve problems.Much of the book is a reference, and to be fair, each element has a pretty good example. But the organization of the reference is poor, making it difficult to find what you are looking for. For example, there are four separate appendices each alphabetically organized, but if you're not sure which one you need, that's frustrating. Worse, the index is simply terrible, not even having entries on essential elements!"
3,Suffers from the Big Honking Example Problem,"This book suffers from the big honking example problem. The authors clearly understand the subject but choose to not show each idea in a small code snippet (one that is usable) but wait until the end of the chapter (or book) and show everything. It would have been more useful to show each xml and xslt template snippet for each topic (such as how to use named templates with the call-template bit) or even how to do a for-each loop. In the end, searching for the language construct in the big honking example became to frustrating and complex, I have switched to a different book."
4,What's neXt?,"This will form the basis for preparing materials for the World Wide Web for years to come. XML/XSLT are sufficiently usable examples of SGML potential to make possible the ""everyone, everything connected"" dream that we all long for.The only real ""problem"" is that it's in print so you can't contract/expand the too-lengthy code examples that interfere with a smooth read of the essential materials. The code is, after all, for machines to read. The rest of us just jump over it.A really nice book.Love."
1,Mr. Tidwell's indulgence at my expense (Time & Money),"... There are simply too few examples and too much indulgence in areas that are of relatively no importance to the learning of XSLT for a beginner. Like a Greek tragedy, Mr. Tidwell's downfall is perhaps his overwhelming knowledge of the subject. He seems to be bored with the basics. He is so far ahead that he had forgotten what's important and/or difficult for someone who is trying to pick up XSLT as a novice. He has forgotten his audience... and instead uses the opportunity to indulge into his wide variety personal interests - computer, chemistry, Shakespeare, etc.I bought this book because it's a recommended book by IBM for XML certification... They did this probably because it's an O'Riley book which is usually good. But this one is an EXCEPTION. I wish they will drop this book from their recommendation list and stop victimizing us. It's too late for me but I hope the ones that follow will read this and think twice."
2,XSLT or Autor hate examples,"I buy very often books in Oreally. I found this book very few useful. It have very few examples and it is very difficult taste your skill. Please, If you make a new edition of this book You habe to understand than Not all of us have your deep know of XSLT.I put 2 stars, because it is not a bad books, but You do not buy this one if you are starting in this world."
1,Not Very Useful AT ALL,"IMO book is too simple, never really give you anything to build on.I bought it for a school project at the end I still bought Michael Kay's book(much more detail)now this one is laying under my bed collecting dust."
2,Content: fair; examples: poor.,"I am growing to dislike this book more and more, as this author refuses to support 'coding along with the text' using his examples. I am frustrated by the examples not working, and again by the fact that he refuses to indicate what the files should be called..is this file a .dtd, an .xslt, or an .xsl file? I like to be able to verify that the examples work so that I can understand it as I go, but the author apparently expects us to take it all on faith. No thanks, buddy."
3,More difficult than it needs to be.,A useful book but not an easy read. Plowing through the material is a worthwile - if painful - experience. In going through this text I got the feeling that the material shouldn't really be as difficult as the presentation made it seem.I haven't looked at some of the books other reviewers have suggested but the new inductee to XSLT may want to start with something else first and if that solves your problem great - if not you might choose this one as a suppliment.
2,Scatter brained - not exactly accurate,"This book is OK :( for an introduction XML, DTDs and XSLT. The information is scattered and not put together very well. A lot of information is also incorrect/inaccurate, be prepared to verify claims about mentioned products and technologies."
2,"Disappointing, not well organized","As a cookbook, it doesn't tell you nearly enough about the nitty-gritty of the functions it documents. On the other hand, it's too disorganized to be a good introduction -- it doesn't lead the reader through the need-concept-implementation loop. The first couple chapters were OK, but I found that every time I tried something using the book, there was an essential piece of information missing. The XSLT reference section was actually less informative than the online XSLT site documentation(!), and the chapters seemed to restate the same information in a different order. I was reduced to trial and error in order to find out how functions actually behaved. Who needs to spend $40 on a book just to wind up browsing the online API doc and experimenting?"
2,Find Another book,"This book was difficult to use, and I found that the author tried to cram too much into his examples. Some concepts were really poorly explained. Fortunately my company paid for this book, and not me."
3,Flawed,"The xsl element reference and function references are useful. The rest of the book is *very* difficult to follow. Not for beginners, and probably not detailed enough for more advanced users."
3,"IBM Cert. ->You will need NewRds' Inside XSLT CH4,7,~8 too","Wow! Mr. Tidwell, Orielly -- I think you embedded this book in XML tags and ran an xpath predicate to filter out all the good stuff. In order for students to get up to speed they will have to purchase ""Inside XML"" for xpath info.I am a third of the way through chapter 5 and am wondering if IBM could change its recommendation due to this book's lack of teaching ability. On a positive not, the book has a professional look and will serve as good reference once the material is digested -- please take pepto bismol prior and have other published material handy.-Ken"
4,Shipment failure,"I would like to tell you that I like this product. I ordered it, but I never received it. I was sent an incorrect item instead, which was returned by me, with the hope of getting the correct item as ordered. However, the whole order was cancelled by Amazon and my total payment was credited back to my credit card. I must admit that I am puzzled."
4,"Quirky, but a great 'sleeper' mystery-comedy","""Plain Clothes"" is a quirky mystery-comedy. It has always been a favourite around our house, but it's difficult to find another house that has seen it! Arliss Howard is perfect as Nick Dunbar, a 'young-looking' undercover detective who must go 'plain clothes' into an odd high school to find evidence to clear his brother on a murder rap. Turns out the staff at this school are all a bit wacky and include the likes of George Wendt, Dianne Ladd, Abe Vigoda, Harry Shearer and Robert Stack (over a live PA system: ""Is this thing on? Now bombing Moscow""). No shortage of suspects. Add to this: Nick doesn't like teens or kids - never did - never was one himself, apparently! He draws the ire of the local 'frat' boys, who don't know what they're up against. And watch for a hilarious scene in which Nick decides to convince everyone that he's for real by presenting his 'metaphor' homework. ahem. Language class was never like this in my town."
5,A Comedy and Muder Mystery combined,"One of My Favorites, A young Detective while working undercover because he does not look old eneough to be a cop is notified that his Brother in High School is being arrested for murdering a teacher. A situation in which the Young Looking Detective decides he believes his Brother and goes Undercover in his Brother High School to find out Who really commited the Crime. He finds out being a Student in High School has changed since he was there and a comedy of situations happen to him. Great cast Arlis Howard, Suzy Amis, George Wendt, Diane Ladd and the Principal is played by Veteran Actor Robert Stack."
3,good thought. bad product,"I like the idea of not having to use a blanket. The idea of SIDS happening to my son is just horrible. The sleep sack has a few flaws. The arm holes are way too small, my son wakes up when we try to put him in the sack. Also, the zipper is too close to the face and can be very hard to manage when it is the middle of the night and you do not want to wake up a sleeping baby. Ive been told of another brand of sleep sack and i think i will try those."
3,the green is ugly,"I do like HALO sleep sacks in general and use them or one of the other brans every night. The green that comes in this gift pack, however, is a really ugly color. The buff is awesome - but buy it separately. The pink and yellow HALO colors are also pretty bad. In person, the blue and the buff and the white are nice."
5,THIS IS WORTH IT,"From reading the other reviews I noticed that these sleep sacks are either loved or hated. My advice is to at least buy one (I realize that they are pricey), see if you like it, then do what you like. Personally, I highly recommend the HALO SLEEP SACKS. I dress my daughter in an appropriate sleeper, then I select the best sleep sack - depending on the weather (If it is cold, I use the fleece one, if it is warm, I use the cotton one, etc.). These sleep sacks give me peace of mind that my daughter is going to sleep well and that she will be warm enough. I agree that they are pricey, but they fit better than the other brands. Also, they are sleeveless so babies will not overheat in them."
5,Appropriate Newborn Blanket Alternative,"Newborns like to be swaddled-- for about one week. After that, they want the freedom to move and kick their arms and legs. The trick here is that babies love the comfort and security of a blanket, but they kick one off too easily. Combine that with mama's worry about providing a safe blanket that's not a dangerous heavy comforter, but still provides warmth! This sleep sack is the solution. For babies being born in winter, the fleece version is perfect. Choose a lightweight option for other times of year. The sack has a tailored fit around baby's head and arms but provides plenty of space for lower body movement and baby never loses her blankie! Now that's what I call an innovative solution.These sleepsacks are a bit pricey, but they wash well and since baby doesn't wear it hard or like an outfit, you can use a few times in a row before washing-- eliminating the need to buy one for every day of the week."
4,A Treasure For Film Maniacs And Historians,"Though you might never got the chance to see those films mentioned in the book, still this book can be considered a gem on your bookshelf.Part I and Part II of the book feature the prehistory and pioneering age of the film which contains rare photos like 'Galloping horse by Muybridge' and a collection of Edison Films' stills."
3,"""KING OF JAZZ"" V.H.S. TAPE","The overall rating is adequate due to the subject matter but the quality is unsatisfactory. The Technicolour restoration is less than stellar and the sound treatment left a lot to be desired. The greatest problem was the defect in the tape at the end where several interference bars appeared over the picture, specifically at the ""Song Of The Dawn"" and ""Melting Pot"" segments. Despite this, I am keeping the tape because it is not worth the hassle and expense to return a $9.00 tape. However, I will not patronize this seller again."
1,Poor quality,"Item purchased was listed ""like new"". Video color was faded badly to the point of appearing more like black and white."
4,The Cost of Suffering,"This novel is almost impossible to get (my library copy was last read in August 1977!) but if you can, this work will provide the reader with a detailed and difficult look at the nature of human suffering. Set in a hospital in besieged Jerusalem in 1948, the characters watch the hopes and aspirations of their lives destroyed by war, injury, and disfigurement (both on a physical and emotional level).And from this field of ugliness, Kaniuk has created a novel of great beauty and range. He shows that in the depth of ugliness and pain, the human spirit can still spring forth and add more vitality to the world."
1,Fake,"I will never order from this site ever again, I thought something was wrong with the packaging with it looking cheaply wrap. It also didn't smell the like the samples I tried in the department store. It was not until I save a story on GMA about fakes colognes that I made the connection, they describe to the bar code on the box how to tell if you have purchase fake cologne. I was so pissed and the fact that I was giving it as a gift to someone really did not sit well.I hope this helps someone and it helps them not order from the vendor, EVER!"
3,My experience is identical to the previous reviewer's,"It sure looks nice -- wish it worked as well as it looks though.Like the previous reviewer mentioned, the highest setting barely browns. Also, there are two buttons, one for ""reheat,"" the other for ""frozen,"" neither of which actually seem to do anything.Bottom line: it toasts just fine, as long as you use more than one toasting cycle. And it is certainly looks nice on the counter top."
1,Doesn't provide any information,"I realize this download is only [dollar amount], but I would recommend putting that money toward an actually book on the subject of Single Stock Futures. I bought this and learned essentially nothing. I also bought the actual futures book by Laffety and found it very good. So, I guess you get what you pay for with this stuff."
2,Not sure what the point was,This book offers absolutely nothing new and doesn't seem to offer anything new or substantive. This is as bad as the biography of Bono by that woman. Ack!
4,Good for pretend play,"My daughter is 9 and still enjoys to play kitchen. While I DO let her into my ""real"" kitchen, she still likes to pretend. It's hard to serve up a plate of plastic turnips and a mound of plastic carrots, but it's easy to put a sandwhich together and call it a meal fit to serve. She cut out real Subway coupons and had her friends put them in their purses and wore an apron, set up a counter, etc.. And since we don't actually eat meat in our house, she insisted on calling it ""tofurkey slices"" and ""mock bologna""! Go girl!"
3,it's ok...,"food is extremely small, not that i expected life like. but it's hard plastic and hard for children to hold a sandwich together."
3,Not for beginner,This book covers everything and more. However its language and order means it is not for the beginner but for someone already fluent and understanding of english grammar. I am a prospective english teacher and was looking forward to the assistance of this book. I think I will in time but will need to read other books first before i can get near to this level. Things are not explained simply but assume you already know the words he uses and the meanings behind them even as early as the first few pages.
5,great resource to have,Grammar for English Language Teacher is a must have book if you are in English teaching business. This book is very user friendly and its content is extremely useful and relevant. I am very pleased to have it and recommend it 100%.
4,Grammar for English Language Teachers: With Exercises and a Key,An easy to read book. Lot of tips and comments. Good for the teacher's own understanding of grammar and how to teach the grammar. Wonderful guide and help!
4,Best Grammar,"After reviewing several grammar books before I started teaching in Southeast Asia, I choose this one. Parrot presents grammar points in an understandable easy to follow format, especially in comparison to the other leading grammars. Easy to use and Highly Recommended!"
5,"¡Excelente, excelente!","Por fin entiendo cómo piensan los profesores de Inglés.Es impresionante aprender desde la otra orilla. El estudiante usa el libro de su pedagogo.Así se ubican rápidamente las claves del proceso, se fija la atención en los puntos centrales y se da cuenta de los errores de aprendizaje más comunes.Si está aprendiendo Inglés británico, se lo recomiendo vivamente."
4,"Okay, so it's a glorified commercial, but. . .",". . . we've seen cartoons like this that were successful, right? Transformers, for example. Dragonflyz only aired briefly, but was very well done. I especially liked the design of the dragons - the wings and forelegs are the same. The villains could have been done better (and so could many other characters) but I tend to overlook the flaws in favor of the artwork and storyline. The voices are also fairly well done, IMO. As a dragon fan, I couldn't resist the series. If you like dragons and don't mind cartoons, then you'd probably enjoy this."
1,Skip this set,"I must have been tired when I chose this black hole through which to toss my money. This set should be three dollars at most. The 'tools' are cheap and flimsy, flat instead of rounded, and in no way good for kids. There are edges where plastic bits were not smoothed down and a child will quickly become frustrated as nothing works. The drill is sad and useless. I'm incensed enough to write this review on Christmas Day just to get it out of my system. I plan to buy my 3 year old son a better set, but the tools from his older brother are better than this set and those are 6 years old. I messed up here, but you don't have to. Do. Not. Buy."
1,Poor quality,"I have always used Bendix brakes due to usually being a very high quality and great stopping power, but it has become very difficult to find them. This set I purchased from Amazon must have been someone else's return, because they came from the return center, but I had to do the same. The friction material was improperly installed on the backing plate, which caused the material to extend past the backing plate on the edges in a few spots. I have never seen, nor expected, such poor quality from Bendix. Had to send them back, and ordered up some Raybestos. Raybestos are just OK in my opinion, nothing great. It's a shame too, because the friction material of the Bendix was visibly much higher quality than the Raybestos. The Bendix were made in USA, and Raybestos in Mexico. Very dissapointed."
1,one word -DEPRESSING!,"These songs are beyond relaxing - they're down right depressing, almost like funeral music ...two songs and I almost needed all the sharps objects in the house hidden from me!"
5,How are you charging money for these? The are PBS funded.,PBSkids.org plays the episodes free and streams them free for public usage. It is fully funded by donations to public broadcasting.They are currently streaming season 3.I don't get how you are selling access to public broadcasting content.I know you have to recoup the costs of hosting. But I would think Amazon would defer the costs of it and write it off as a charitable donation to public broadcasting.
5,Five 1/2 year old son loves Word Girl!,"My son gets the humor and learns new words thanks to this show. ""Famished"" is not a typical word for a five year old, but he uses it correctly thanks to this show!"
5,WordGirl Rocks.,Who said educational kids shows can't make adults laugh? This one does every time for me--which is difficult to do.
4,Excellent overview,"Excellent summaries. Ocassionally a few points may not be entirely accurate, but for anyone who is looking for a good summary of the text to review this is the one to go to.I used this to study for a major exam on this book after having read the entire Republic. It was very helpful review."
3,A must for every Lexus enthusiast.,"A nice coffee table book for anyone interested in the effort put in by Toyota to create the Lexus cars. Covers it all from preproduction testing to the new LS430, SC430's. It has a lot of pictures and information about the main people behind Lexus cars. Lots of good numbers information as well. I bought it because it covers my favorite car: the SC400. Kinda expensive, but i guess if u own a lexus u might be able to drop 50 bux on this book. its not that big, can be read in a day, but is also good bathroom reading :)"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Are you kidding me? 4 pages? 1 Star was the minimum rating allowed. Otherwise it would have been a big fat zero. Amazon should be ashamed.
4,a good primer,this book makes points that are easily understood yet quite deep in their meaning. i believe it's a good book for anyone that is not quite keen on what's really going on with rampant capitalism or what really happened when the soviet union ditched communism. i haven't highlighted a book this much since i was in school. amazing!
1,A Piece of crap....,I felt nothing from this product. I would not recommend it at all. Pro-Tens Stimulator? Ha . It should state PRO CRAP!...Dont buy....I would give it NO STAR!!!
5,Gorgeous,"Glorious book - All pertinent basic information included, including tools and step-by-step processes. Differs from the others in quality of paper, artistic layout and goes far beyond merely presenting the information. Also includes other glass art techniques. A treasure."
1,Awful,This Novella was edited from the original very much it has english subs. thats a help but this is not the original the other one does not have subs so i do not recommend this to anyone to buy it is so badly edited you don't get the full story of what is happening with Maria Jose and Alejandro
2,Sortilegio,"I'm watching this Novela now on the Spanish station ,I understand and speak Spanish . I love this Novela , the scenery and story line is great . I would love to own this Novela . However from All the reviews I have read that the story line has been cut so short , I would not waist my money on it , the Novela has plenty to say and they sure cannot tell the story in 17 hours . That's too bad , it's a great story for those who can see it on tv and really enjoy the full version ."
1,Lacks completed episodes,"I bought this dvd three times and again, I learned the episodes are incomplete because scenes are cut out from the dvd, the english subs is correct but after seeing the dvd and seeing the series on youtube I found a love of scenes that were cut out from the dvd."
1,Awful,"The DVD is very edited I watched it for one hour and realized it was a waste of money. I saw the telenovela and they managed to edit important scenes that ties the remaining scenes together. I don't recommend , it is not worth the money."
1,I dont recommend,"i saw the novela on the screen and I loved it so much, so i decided to buy it.but it was abig mistake, most of the beautiful scenes was deleted from the DVD,I was really disapointed."
5,Give it a try and you'll love it,The editing in this soap is very good. There are time when you are like WTF... but the VAST majority of the time you understand what is going on and can follow it easily. Now b/c of the editing you do need to WATCH it b/c it is EDITED so you need to pay attention. The twists are not excessive either. they def keep you very much interested. I HIGHLY recommend this. b/c of this novala i bought another one that william levy is in. can't recommend this enough!!!
3,Beuatiful,Beautiful Telenovela is really an enchanting Telenovela. William Levy and Jacqueline Bracamontes are a nice couple. Sortilegio de amor could have been better suited than Sortilegio as title!
2,Wow. DC should sue,"I know from other reviews on this book that they were doing a ""tribute"" to Superman when they came up with Supreme, but damn, they didn't have to go out and rip off the entire DC universe as well! I had a hard time reading the stories here cause I was seriously distraced by matching up all of the characters here with the DC version they're ripping...I mean giving tribute to. I mean C'mon! Polyman? not only having the same powers as Plastic man but almost the same costume right down to the silly visor and quirky attitude. Fisherman? no, not a Aquaman wanna-be as you might think, but a Green Arrow clone who uses a fishing pole ???? to fight crime....well, get this book if only to play the match game. oh yeah, one last one...Supreme has a super powered cape-wearing dog as well. oy!"
2,Just a normal superhero story,"If you're looking for something with the brilliance of Moore'sWatchmenorV for Vendetta(the books, not the movies), look someplace else. Aside from the very beginning, this is just a standard superhero story, marred by a gawdy drawing style and constant flashbacks to 1950s-style art. Big Superman fans might enjoy it, but those who like Moore's more complex stuff will find it wanting."
1,Very good Superman stories,"And they are, but why are they in a Supreme book? The reason why I liked Supreme was because he wasn't Superman. He had all the power, but was an egotistical violent and reckless a%#hole, even believing himself a god.I don't know why Alan Moore didn't just ask to write Superman, or who told him he couldn't, and if somebody did, I hope they have been fired from DC.Instead of taking that violent Supreme on a personal journey and slowly turning him more like superman, he just retroactively rewrote all his history where as he now got his power from a meteor (Supremium) instead of being experimented upon with drugs and radiation (more like Captain America).If you like Superman, than this book is for you, only think about it as an elseworlds series by Alan Moore (which it should be) and you'll love it.If you liked the original Supreme from when Image started, then this book is definitely NOT for you, because apparently, that Supreme just ceased to exist."
4,Haven't Read A Comic Book in 40 Years? Try This.,"I loved comics as a kid. Superman was my favorite comic book for years until I discovered Marvel at age 11 and never returned to DC land. Alan Moore's ""Supreme"" character is a thinly-veiled parody of/homage to Superman as he was 'way back when in the 40s and 50s and 60s in his Golden Age. If you also read comics as a kid and then drifted away, these issues will bring the charm of those sometimes infantile products back in a way that most current comics can't achieve. It's a very meta/pomo/deconstructionist series, self-reflixively pondering what it means to be a serial character trapped in a formulaic format, but it's clearly a labor of love, and the brilliantly-realized 40s and 50s and 60s and 70s issues of the ""Supreme"" comic are very funny in their un-ironic treatment of a beloved icon.If you read comics as a kid and are now a great big grown-up, ""Supreme"" will allow you to visit some places in your head you haven't been in many years. Recommended."
3,Flawed Reproduction of Great Work,"Alan Moore's writing on this book is great. He's able to take the Mort Weisinger version of Superman from the 1950s and early 60s and give it the Alan Moore touch. However, this particular collection is a terrible reproduction of the series. It almost looks like someone photocopied the pages from the original comic books and just bound them together. (Note: Subsequent printings fixed this problem, and it is no longer an issue if you get one of the later printings).You must read this work by Alan Moore. However, buying this particular production of it should be the third choice for acquiring it only if a better production in the future is impossible or if you cannot get the original comics due to the lack of availability or prohibitive cost."
4,Good Maps for the Money,"""You get what you pay for,"" and that's true with this item. The maps are good---much larger than expected. However, the paper they are printed on is very thin. I suggest if you use these to laminate them first. This will certainly cost you more than you'll pay here for these maps.Maps were shipped in a tube and did not arrive when expected. Amazon.com was merciful and refunded my shipping costs since I had paid extra for expedited shipping.Overall, a good value. But if you're looking for a heavy-weight, good paper quality map----just keep looking."
5,Great quality at a great bargain!,The maps were a lot bigger than I expected and very nice detail. Perfect for the classroom or office.
3,colorful,"Nothing too heavy-duty, just made of paper. Holding up well so far though. Only real negative is they are way more colorful than I expected, with a lot of pink."
1,practically criminal,"Looking to become acquainted with one of the most divine voices of the century? Then don't look (or listen) here!The best thing about this CD is the cover photo. The tracks, (no dates, but they are recognizeable as recordings compiled elsewhere from the 1930-45 period), have disappointingly poor sound quality. About half are the same recordings found on the EMI CHD 7610532 Jussi Bjoerling: Opera Arias; all can be found in the 4-CD Studio Recordings set from last year. (On top of it, they left out the '45 Nessum Dorma! the '44 Vesti! the '37 Lucevan! What *were* they thinking?!)Just say NO to this offering - it's practically criminal."
4,Insightful!,"Warren Buffett is a legendary financial wizard who has built a fortune based on the principles of value investing. Many volumes have been written about his investing approach, but Robert P. Miles' treatise is a bit different from most of the others. The author is obviously a great fan of Buffett - at times, the book borders on plutocratic hagiography - but his all-encompassing admiration lends his work a distinctive tone. Reading this exposition is like hearing a star-struck fan discuss the techniques of a favorite movie star. Dazed admiration helps Miles see patterns, connections and details about Warren Buffett that you might not find in a more objective or more focused tome. If you want a nitty-gritty, pros and cons analysis of Buffett's investing style, go elsewhere. If a down-home and frankly admiring analysis, complete with investing advice based on Buffett's principles, is more your style, we assure you, you've come to the right place. No naysayers allowed."
4,Frenchtown Summer,"This is a very different format for the author, but very readable. Anyone who has grown up in Massachusetts will surely recognize Frenchtown as Leominster. I could personally relate to the setting, sights and smells portrayed in this short, unique book. It was a nostalgic trip back to my hometown after being away for 50 years."
2,Didn't work for me...,"I really enjoy Robert Cormier's novels. I've read several of them and enjoy the Monument, Frenchtown setting particularly of some of them. I also like YA novels in verse, Hesse's ""Witness"" and Koertge's ""Shakespeare Bats Cleanup,"" for instance, are terrific. Other reviewers here have quoted the first four lines of the book: ""That summer in Frenchtown/ in the days/ when I knew my name/ but did not know who I was./ Perhaps I would have liked Eugene's story more a few years later when he did know who he was. This was uninvolving. Cormier's heroes tend to be lonely and loners, observers as Eugene is, but he's so very cut off.I imagine I will *love* the next Cormier novel I read."
5,Frenchtown Summer,"I decided to read this book for a young adult literature class and was quite pleased to read a unique piece of work from Robert Cormier. In comparison to other stories I have read, The Chocolate War and Heroes, Frenchtown Summer is not tell a dark story, but is intricately shadowed with secrets and tragedy.The story follows a young 12-year old boy named Eugene during the summer of his first paper route. Eugene spends the summer in search of his identity (a common theme among many teens) and finds him self in need of approval from his father. Eugene also discovers a desire for adventure and through this learns deep secrets about his family.Although this book was a quick read, it should be read several times as it written in poetic verse. The pages are open and allow for the imagination to visualize the story as it unfolds. I particularly enjoyed this story because Eugene reminded me somewhat of myself at that age. Frenchtown Summer was defiantly one of Robert's most unique stories."
5,Greece at its best,"Santorini has the most scenic beauty of all the Greek islands with its white towns on cliffsides surrounding the vast caldera of an ancient volcano. Lots of footage of people and stores in Fira. Crete is the most diverse and lush of the Islands. The palace of Knossos is amazingly well preserved from the height of Minoan civilization, lots of shots as well of the smaller palace near Melia, active beach shots, British pubs, fishermen at work and a 5 star resort favored by royalty."
1,useless,"Terrible. will go on for two pages describing a 'setting' or feature, going deep into detail, without telling you how to invoke the feature or menu until the end. I just threw this book out as we speak."
2,"It's OK, but not worth the price.","Overall, this book was a mildly interesting, quick read, probably suitable for a weekend around the house. I found myself, however, mildly fatigued due to the awkwardly strung together facts, as if they were simply plucked from their sources and placed on paper with a minimum of effort. Unfortunately, except for a few points, any information in this book isn't ""new"" and could probably be found, with some effort, in encyclopedia's, National Geographic, etc. In my opinion, I would be willing to pay as much as seven dollars for this book, however, not the publisher's price, demanded by such obvious esoteric subject matter."
5,"Great saw, fast shipping, good cust svc","Briefly, I did a lot of research and chose this saw. Amazon had it for $569. Added to cart, waited two days and then bought it. Got billed $599 as the price had changed in the interim. I complained about this and they credited it back without argument! Great customer service.I chose the free shipping. It took three days, was reliable, and the saw arrived in great shape. One hour to put it all together and now I have a great little saw.I do high end trim and cabinet work. This is no shop-based cabinet saw, nor is it quite as good as the Jet cast iron contractor saw we lug around. But it's portable (very) and cuts great. We put a Freud blade on it and it is fantastic. Really no complaints at this time. Very impressive given its portability.And this much capability at $569 shipping included. Hard to complain.Jtn"
