5,Awesome is all I can say.,"I can only say that every Christian, or person for that matter, should read this book. The other reviewers have done a great job with giving you detail and I second all the possitive reviews. Invest the time to read passages of this book regularly and your life will get better, period."
3,Imitation,I liked it very much. I don't like the requiement the I need to have a number of words to complete this review. Pain in the but.
3,Modular furniture and a little espionage,"More than the actualised album I like the *idea* of this CD - an easy-listening concept album based around a romantic 1960's apres-ski lifestyle that evokes images of secret agents in mod ski-wear defeating their enemies on the Alpine slopes (then it's back to the ski-lodge in time for martinis by the fire). There's also nods to other James Bond style pursuits - St Tropez, sportscars, impossibly long white scarves etc, etc...Well, that's basically the theme this CD aims for, but sadly the result falls a little shy of the mark. The elements are all here, orchestral arrangements (albeit a little lo-fi, recorded in ""Sofasound"" whatever that may be), the ba-ba-dee-da vocal choruses and titles like ""Girl on A Snowmobile"" and ""Groovin' Happenin'"" etc...Overall it's a fun, fantasy excursion but maybe its self-consciousness lets it down in the end. That and a few really weak songs. Disappointing, but some will find it pleasing."
5,A book I've given to many friends,"This book is an eye-opener. It can change the way you look at things from the start. Yes, it deals with the peak-oil issue but from a deeply felt, insightful viewpoint that makes us look at energy not just as fossil fuel but as sunlight itself. It delves into concepts of living off current sunlight versus ancient sunlight and the implications of a culture built upon such cheap, abundant energy and the upcoming diminishing of such a source -- the last hours of it. Thom Hartman expresses a genuine concern and vision for the future of humanity against a backdrop of the insights shared in this wonderful book. Highly recommended."
1,Good intent but poor organizaion makes for a painful read,"The title and first chapter of the book are novel enough and caught my attention. But the remainder of the book is poorly written. The sentences and paragraphs are disjointed and the ideas seem randomly thrown together; these make for a less than enjoyable read. In addition, the author does a poor job of tying togethr his points into a more coherent argument so sometimes the little personal stories and attempted points fall flat or don't make sense. Although I am an avid reader of non-fiction environmental texts, I could barely get through this one. As other negative reviews have suggested, the book contains a good deal of philisophical fluff. This type of writing has its place but certainly there are other books that do a much better job of arguing the points. I do not recommend this book. In fact, I'm returning the copy I purchased because it's not worth holding onto for future reference."
2,Do not waste your money,I highly recomend NOT reading this book. It is more fluff than real substance. If you are seriously looking for good sound research on the importance of environmental conservation look someplace else.
1,Bogus,Those that scared us about global warming now want to say cooling. Please lets make up your mind. Could the two forces balance? Duh?
5,Grim reality and hope for change,"A very grim picture is painted of the world today along with the causes of our current crisis. The final chapters give us the hope that with major changes in the way we live,and treat our planet and each other we can make a difference and perhaps avoid some of the perils we now face."
5,Life Changing Book,"We all know the environment worldwide is in deep, deep trouble.Thom Hartman, in crystal clear language, tells us exactly what the problems are, and what we can do about them.I particularly liked the chapter on the importance of trees. Who knew that there is virtually nothing on earth more useful and important to all life than a tree?You've heard about the frog in the water that is slowly being brought to a boil - so slowly that the frog never realises there's a problem until it's too late. If you decide to skip Thom's book, just close your eyes, go to sleep, and let the boiling water do the rest.If you do read it, I hope the first thing you do afterwards is grow some trees, and find places to plant them! In the US there are all kinds of opportunities to buy virtually every tree seed there is online. Buy some - plant them - and bless you!Eric Winter"
5,Great and Important Book,Everyone who cares about the earth and the fate of humanity should read this book.
5,A Most Important Book!,"I read Conversations with God and in Book 3, God states that he inspired this book. I bought it and couldn't put it down, it was so meaningful. Hartmann wisely avoids talking about political solutions and recommends that we change our world perspective, one of the most difficult things to do yet the most important place to start. Although the title seems negative, Hartmann ends it on an optimistic note.One of the most important books on saving the planet that you'll ever read. Share it with everyone you know or better yet buy more copies and give them to your family and friends."
2,"some facts, some blue sky","This book has a seductive title, and the author takes one through countless examples of the sun actually being a great source of energy. the author depends on trite phrases rather than science to make or prove his assertions. Enjoyable reading because of a quick and exciting style, but lacking in substance. I get sick of phrases like...""some scientists say""..and ""many experts agree"".....the question is who agrees and when did they agree? A stopped clock is right twice a day, as one of my old Yale professors did say. So too with this book.Thanks you for the opportunity to express my opinion.Jack FlobeckChairmanAqua Prima Center Inc.think tank for water research."
3,Great music but...,"This movie has small pieces of the Godspell. The music is great but the images don't help much. It's perfectly fine if you just listen and close your eyes. There are a couple of songs that work fine with visuals, but most of it doesn't.I think you have to like the Godspell (bible) to like the movie."
2,This is just not right...,"I was in a production of Godspell and can honestly say the movie lacks the edge of the stage production. It's way too dated and portrays Jesus & Co. as a bunch of flower children. Some cute moments, but all in all the play is tons better. (Oh, to the reviewer who called it Christian propaganda: trust me, this is not what Christians are really like.)"
5,Fun movie,"I put this movie in my DVD player fully intending to have it play in the background while I cleaned house, but I soon found myself drawn into the story and the songs. Victor Garber is absolutely enchanting and the songs are wonderful (although the choreography is a bit on the cheesy side). I disagree that the film needs to be updated, I think the story is timeless and most people could stand to take a lesson or two from it."
4,Godspell,"I bought this movie because I love the interesting rendition of the Gospel acording to Matthew, and the music is outstanding. I realize it is over 30 years old, but it still has a wonderful message. The scene when they are singing and dancing on top of the World Trade Center is extremely moving considering what that building now represents to us all as Americans. It brought me to tears."
4,Hollow and unmoving? I couldn't disagree more.,"The cast and score of Godspell infuse life and energy into well-known scripture and sometimes difficult to imagine context in a way that is both uplifting and inspiring. Jesus is perfectly compassionate and kind; Judas is loving but conflicted; the portrayal of the Pharisees is clever and moving.The body of the film comprises several parables which are each creatively imagined and directed.Though the ""gethsemane scene"" takes some license with the Biblical account, the film does quite a good job sticking close to Matthew's Gospel (even while projecting it onto modern-day New York City).No recreation of the gospel is perfect; Godspell doesn't pretend or try to be. It is a screen adaptation, hippie interpretation of a timeless story that will facinate and enlighten."
5,A Blast from the Past,I have enjoyed the music from Godspell for years and now can watch the same movie I saw as a teen. This arrived very promptly.
2,Oddspell,"Some great music, but the movie is quite dated. Almost makes fun of the Bible in its approach."
2,Hippie version of the bible,"This was a very very interesting movie. I like how they told the stories of the Bible in a more modern way that you can understand them better. Godspell is a very energic movie and because I am watching it in the year 2012 I felt it was a little to much hippie for me. The people in the movie were very odd. There was a part in the movie were ""John the Baptist"" painted the faces of the followers and I didn't really understand that. Was it suppose to be symbolizing something? Although the people dressed as clowns and other weird characters they told the story of the bible well and I would recomend this movie to people who had a hard time understanding the stories from the bible and the meaning behind them!"
4,One more way to spread the word,"While I understand that some people don't feel that this movie is a the best representation of the Gospel, I feel that it reaches an audience that might otherwise not hear the word of God. It lays out in simple terms how to treat others and how to start on the path of a good life with Jesus in it. It opens up the teachings of Christ in a very understanable way and hopefully encourages people to turn to the bible for more answers and deeper learning."
5,Awesome Transaction,This movie has to be in my Top 5 of all times. I first saw the movie in the 70s on a high school field trip from my Drama Class. I am not an overly religious person but this certainly shares the word of God along with music that I could (and have) listened to over and over again. I don't collect a lot of movies but this one was hard to find on subscription or streaming services. Well worth the money!!!
4,A Fun Way To Learn some inportant lessons...,"You can watch this with your children,grandchildren or friends. It teaches important life lessons.The movie is fun to watch and the music is great."
3,"Great Show, Horrible Recording","First, let me just say that I love this show. It is very original and the music is amazing. The perfomances are good, too, though not as fresh as the OBC. Much of the comedy comes across, even though it is very dated. My biggest problem is that this video has a lot of sound and picture problems. Sadly, there is lots of distortion that kills Day by Day and Alas For You. If you know the show and just like a reminder of it, get the video. If you've never seen Godspell before, wait until you can see it live."
5,Gogspell,"I love this version of the 70's Broadway version. This is the musical where ""Day by Day"" came from. But it does make me a little sad; part ot the movie, you see the actors singing and dancing on top of one the World Trade Owers."
3,Old School Godspell,"This was purchased as a Christmas Gift for a grandson, whose drama class put on Godspell Jr. and he was wondering about the original."
5,"Eye-catching, clever, educational and entertaining.","The only way I could get my teen-age church school class to pay attention to the events which have so changed the history of the western world. GODSPELL instructs as it entertains and appeals to what is important to young people: belongingness, identification, and present reality. The Musical brings a 2000 year old story into the present without loss of meaning or appeal."
3,When you can't see it live.....,"This is the only way to see it! ""Godspell"" is a perfect example of a 70's rock musical. All of the songs are great, and I think, stand the test of time. Of course the problem with this as a movie, and with ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", is the stage show far surpasses the film.I only hope that future generations will bear this in mind as they watch. These movies are poor representatives of these musicals. Don't judge the musical based on the movie. BUT if this is the only way you're going to become acquainted with it, then definitely see it. The music alone is worth it."
5,"""The Bible For Non-Christians""","Godspell is breathtaking. That's about all I'll say. I'm part of an amateur theater group, and we're putting on this production as we speak. Being Pagan, I used to hold little interest in religious plays, but, upon hearing the soundtrack, I was instantly enthralled. I bought the movie a few months ago, and have watched it at least three times a week since! I still can't keep my eyes from watering at the final scene. It's very powerful. JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR and JOSEPH & THE AMAZING TECHNICOLORED DREAMCOAT have always been favorites of mine, since I love Andrew Lloyd Webber, but this musical far surpasses them both. It taught me storied from the Bible, and actually interested me, which almost nothing else has been able to do."
5,"For the first time, I got it.","Being raised Jewish, I always had a difficult time understanding how a modest Rabbi could reach out to and captivate enough people to remain relevant centuries after his death. After seeing Godspell, I got it. Garber creates a delicately nuanced performance where you understand how his followers, each so distinct from the other, love him and learn from him. The joy in the first parts of the movie only deepens the horror and tragedy of the end...and then the joy again, implying resurrection. I got it."
1,NO!,I did not like the movie godspell! I have seen other movies like Jesus Christ super star and it was much better. I believe that it made a mockery of what religion teaches us.
1,God Awful,"this musical is the pits. I saw it on Broadway and loved it because the sets were as integral as the production. But the major mistake the film makers made was to film this on location, using the actual streets of Manhattan (where I live)It was a gimmick that you couldn't forget in watching this hideous exercise in movie making. In watching the cast prancing up empty New York streets, and wondering how did they do that, you get easily bored because there's so little color. The cast is wretched. No wonder you've never heard of any of them since except for Victor Garber. ""Day by Day"" sounds like a bunch of bleating sheep, because the singers are so desperate to make the story come alive. I'm usually a sucker for any musical but this is one that will never find its way onto my shelf."
1,"Lord, have mercy!","To be quite frank, the only reason I would give this movie even one star is for Victor Garber's brilliant portrayal of a modern-day Jesus. But even with him, this musical is nothing but a dreary piece of Christian propoganda. The lack of subtlety disgusted me, along with the insulting way in which evil was portrayed as being jokingly punished with - oops! - an eternity of Hell. The grating giggles and irritating jolliness with which the fates of mortals were blindly decided made me wonder whether I was in Hell already. The Sunday School script was worse than an episode of ""Seventh Heaven"", and the simpering seventies soft-rock hymns were nauseating. It makes me wonder whether Jesus himself wouldn't have over-turned a few of their tables. Unless you feel you would enjoy what seems like an end-of-bible-camp, anti-""heathen"", Christian ""Rock"" songfest, give this one a wide berth."
4,"Superb music, adequate scripts, nice DVD","As someone of another faith, I still find Godspell a stirring and interesting musical. Victor Garber is so young here, and so vulnerable. So un-Jesus looking. But with a wonderful voice. (Also note an early appearance of Lynne Thigpen, a terrific performer).The songs are great and clever, while the script is sort of weak. It's adapted from a gospel, of course, and the poetry of a lot of the words themselves is quite moving. But the words seem extra and bland next to the singing.Another plus: they somehow managed to make New York City seem entirely empty.The DVD transfer is pretty good, but there are no good extra features."
5,Godspell DVD Movie,Was very pleased with how quickly it came in the mail. I love having this in my DVD collection. Will consider also getting Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar.
5,Godpell is the greatest!,"I must say, I love Godspell! Right now I am in a production of Godspell, and it is the most fun I have ever had! It is free spirited play, you get to be creative, and it gets you in touch with God. Thanx"
4,Good beginner's drum set,Excellent for learning the basics at a very reasonable price!Plug in an AMP and it works for any garage band.Plug and a headset and everyone in the house will love you!
1,Beware of Pacific Digital products,"My experience is with the Drum Extreme DX-150, not the DX-MIDI-PRO drum kit.However, the USB module that came with our DX-150 quit only a couple of months after purchase. The seller honored only a 30 day warranty and required us to contact Pacific Digital. Ha. Check out their web site...""support no longer available"".You've been warned."
4,Very Good Rainy Afternoon Movie,This movie is a good Sci-fiction movie to watch on a rainy afternoon. The acting is good.
1,Missing Pages,The book has missing sections of pages. I contacted the seller when I found out and received no response. Too bad.
2,Needs a good editor,"The book is wordy and needed a good editor. There is way too much background. The author is obviously knowledgeable and his advice seems worthwhile, but his explanations are a bit obtuse."
4,A superior setting - but what happens next?!,"I just finished Children of Night and I cannot believe the third volume was never published. The writing is fluid and easy to read and the backdrop of a fascist society makes for a fascinating setting. It also makes a change for this type of sci fi that Fripp Enos has yet to bring down the establishment or even to make a significant dent. As another BOOK once said, 'Space is big, really big'... especially in the Space Mavericks books."
1,Dead on Arrival,I order this compressor twice. The first time it came leaking from the tank at the pressure release valve. I asked for a replacment and the second came with a leaking crank case and would not hold air.finally I got a refund.I'd reccomend just saving your money until you can afford a better compressor. This product isn't worth the time.
1,RUN AWAY FROM THIS ONE,"Unless you like to fix brand new things, buy this locally or from someone that will send you repalcement parts without a hassle. I can't even say how it works yet, it arrived damaged so that's a one star rating. why so harsh? Because peple have complained about this very issue I am dealing with for numerous months. I thought since no one had complained recently about parts breaking off in shipping that maybe the folks at Makita had corrected the packing /shipping problem. WRONG. I got this and fired up only to find the small elbow on the release valve is made of cheap brass, and was installed with no tape. It snapped right off at some point in transit. The box looked fine, so there is no way to tell when it happened. The cheap brass and poor assembly is making repair almost impossible, already spent an hour on it and it's not even running yet. That is UNACCEPATBLE. I am betting it's a real hassle to contact Makita for new aprts. Will let you know..."
3,Makita Wake Up!!,Someone at Makita should be reading all this bad press on their product!! I did. I won't take a chance. I am buying a compressor from a different manufacturer.
4,Packing Problems Seem to be Fixed,"I purchased this compressor from Amazon in September, 2008. The packing problems that many reviewers have detailed seem to have been fixed. The compressor was packaged in an inner cardboard box that was fitted to the shape of the compressor. The inner box fit tightly into an outer cardboard box, providing fairly good protection. I don't think the compressor could be damaged in this shipping configuration unless a relatively sharp object penetrated both the inner and outer layer of corrugated cardboard. While possible, I consider the odds of this happening during shipping relatively low.I've only used the compressor for a few minutes, so I will not make any judgment on it's performance, except to say that it is relatively quiet. I'll be able to use it indoors without concern for noise."
3,Once Again - cracked motor housing!,"Had my fingers crossed that I'd get one of the good ones that wasn't damaged. No such luck. The motor housing was cracked at the back of the unit so that several large pieces came off. Very disappointed. Didn't bother with the return process since I need a compressor NOW, and the damage is cosmetic, even though it is painful have a new tool arrive damaged. Otherwise seems to be a very well constructed compressor."
4,Great buy,I am very satisfied with this compressor. It is quality made and operates well. The price was reasonable. I would recommend to others..
4,Quietest compressor I've heard,"I bought this compressor to replace one that I bought at the orange box store less than 2 years ago. It is the quietest compressor I've ever heard or seen, you can stand next to it and carry on a conversation at a normal voice level. It delivers nearly as much air as the one it replaced for less than half the money ($199 with free shipping). The tank allows use of nail guns, staplers and other tools of that type without problem, however it is to small for use with air wratchets or impact wrenches without waiting. I wouldn't really recomend it for that type of use on a regular basis. I coupled it with the tank off the old compressor and am able to get by until I can afford a larger one. All in all it is a very good unit for the money, it arrived quicker than expected and was in good shape."
3,Smashed crankcase cover,"The infamous packaging/delivery problem persists. The compressor came by USPS and I had to pick it up from the post office. The shipping carton is in perfect condition, but, upon opening the box, I was stunned to see the crankcase cover was smashed in and the uploading tub was dangling.Fortunately, Makita head quarter is only about 20 miles from my house. I called the service department and the manager is very friendly to offer for the repair. After waiting for an hour at the service shop, I came out with a working compressor.I only have had the compressor for 3 days, and, it has been working like they advertised."
3,Damaged!!!,"Received unit and much to my dismay...it was damaged. The Black plastic engine housing was cracked with the broken pieces in the box. Additionally, the paint on the handle and the tank was abraded. The box itself was undamaged and the packaging seemed robust. Not sure how unit could be damaged inside with no box damage outside?The unit itself seems to be very sturdy and I am looking forward to a replacement. If it too is damaged, I may invoke the Makita warranty to get replacement parts instead of buying retail. I still am excited about the unit...just not the packaging or the condition of the unit out of the box."
5,Favorite compressor,"After 40 years as a painting & sandblasting contractor, a store-owner, wood shop owner, etc., I am surprised at how strongly I feel about this little compressor. It is so quiet that I was stunned at how it easily handled all my different sized air nailers--including roofing and framer. Almost as soon as I started it, I realized that it was the neatest little workhorse I've had. Incidentally, the condition was perfect as well as the packaging. I almost didn't order it because of the packaging reviews, but mine was perfect right out of the box."
2,Never Learn,"Even though I saw serveral instance where the unit came in broke, I thought mine would be OK. Wrong!! Compressor arrived with damage to the shroud and the oil cap. Both appeared because of packaging. Still working trying to get the parts to repair."
1,Arrived damaged II1,As with my first experience the second Makita air compressor arrived in the same condition. The same uploading brass elbow was broken when it arrived from shipment. This is a design flaw in the product. The elbow sticks out away from the compressor and it is very fragile and shears off with any type of contact from anything. The packaging was not sufficient to cushion the elbow in shipment. Can you imagine every time the compressor were to hit anything or tip over the elbow would shear off.Amazon was slow to ship and I got an email that said they were having trouble shipping the compressor to me. I don't know what kind of trouble but the compressor was sent to me several days after the initial time for shipping.They are going to come and pick up the compressor and refund my money after they get the compressor. They lost a sale. They will only send two out. Somebody in management and quality control needs to wise up regarding this problem.
5,Best All Around Compressor,"Like a lot of others I was concerned that it would arrive damaged, it wasn't. MAC700, the smaller one offered, is great for just about any tool I have and I find it to be a lot quieter than I expected. The manual is lacking in some areas. especially the 20 minute break in. Google it and you will find several videos and write ups. I have no regrets on this purchase at all."
3,"Received damaged, Returning to Amazon",Like several other users I also received this unit damaged. I am returning this back for a refund. Item looked very well built but due to the damage I could not test its functionality.
4,Shipping Damage Still Occurring,"Just like others my first one arrived damaged. Plastic housing in many, many pieces. Oil all over everything. I am still looking forward to the product when I get a good one, here is hoping it is the second one."
5,Chalk up one for the good guys!,"Hooray, mine got here undamaged! (even though the American Tourister testers at Fed Ex had punched two big holes in the box, as usual. The other day I watched them throw a box containing a fragile clockwork I had ordered out of the Fed Ex van window onto my concrete driveway!) And with that, it's all Makita quality! Quiet, quick, and built to last. I would chance it again for this compressor."
4,Makita MAC700 Compressor - overall works well,"Makita MAC700 The Hotdog 12.4 Amp 2 Horsepower 2.6 Gallon Oiled Single Hotdog CompressorReceived product quickly; easy directions for setup and use; so far works as intended and my expectations which is home project, currently powering a nail gun for floor installation, later wood trim and possibly some small furniture projects. I'd recommend it but have no previous compressors to compare it with."
1,broken twice,This item showed up broken twice. Fixed it myself the second time. Worse than that is after fixing it I looked online to write this review and it is $25 cheaper. I should have sent it back a third time and gotten the discount.
4,"great product arived broken, 2nd was fine","i highly recommend this compressor, its very quiet and is very user friendly. The only bad thing is mine arrived damaged from amazon on my initial order as the black plastic guard was munched inside the packaging and on my 2nd one the small amount of factory oil spilled and soaked the box and coated unit.But for my use (blowing out my pc, inflating tires, and blowing out dust from corners) this unit works great and isnt that heavy. Very compact as well."
4,excellent compressor but a bit heavy,"This Makita compressor is extremely well made and reasonably quiet. You could use this compressor in a 12x12 room and not have to use ear protection. Surprisingly, the capacity of this little pup pretty much kept up with a 3 1/2"" framing nailer.My only complaint is that it's pretty heavy for its capacity and awkward/tiring to carry for long distances or up/down stairs or a construction site. If it was 10# lighter I'd give it 5*. To wit, I think I'll order that micro Senco compressor (20 # weight) for jobs that don't require as much air capacity as this Makita."
4,"PACKAGED FOR STORES, NOT SHIPPING","THE OTHER REVIEWS ARE RIGHT ON TARGET. WHEN I OPENED THE BOX I FOUND THE UNIT UNUSABLE DUE TO A CRACKED CRANKCASE COVER. THE FACTORY PACKAGING IS DEFININTELY INADEQUATE FOR THIS TYPE OF TRUCKING AROUND. I CALLED MAKITA AND THEY SAID THEY CAN'T SEND PARTS BECAUSE I BOUGHT IT THROUGH AMAZON. I CALLED AMAZON AND THEY DID THE RIGHT THING. THEY IMMEDIATELY SHIPPED ME A REPLACEMENT UNIT WITH A BETTER SHIPPING OPTION AND E-MAILED ME A RETURN LABEL FOR THE DAMAGED UNIT. THE NEW UNIT ARRIVED IN GOOD SHAPE THREE DAYS LATER. I HAVE OTHER COMPRESSORS AND THIS ONE IS NOW DEFINITELY MY FAVORITE. IT'S WELL BUILT WITH GOOD POWER AND RUNS VERY QUIETLY. SMALL INCONVIENCE THAT FIRST ONE WAS DAMAGED BUT AMAZON DID A GREAT JOB WITH THE REPLACEMENT. IF MAKITA WOULD PUT SOME EXTRA FOAM IN THE PACKAGING THEY WOULD HAVE A PERFECT PRODUCT. BUY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT."
1,Another Damaged compressor,"Like many other reviewers, mine too arrived damaged....both the shroud and the unloading valve were broken (see other reviews) with no apparent damage to the shipping box. Makita service would not replace parts under warranty so I had to send the whole unit back to Amazon. Am waiting for my replacement unit (backordered) from Amazon with my fingers crossed. It's time Amazon stepped up to the plate and acknowledge that there is a serious problem with this unit arriving damaged. Also I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with Makita's response to this issue. This will be the last Makita product that I own."
3,Great Compressor - Poor Packaging,"The compressor works great and is relatively quiet. It is heavy, but designed so it is easy to move around. The problem is with the packaging, like others, mine arrived with a broken part (motor shroud). Fortunately, It was not bad enough that I needed to send the entire unit back (apparently just getting a replacement shroud is not possible, unless you pay $32 for it)and I couldn't see sending the whole compressor back and then possibly getting another one with even more damage."
5,Exceptional Product,"After reading numerous reviews about shipping damage with this item, I was still inclined to order one considering the good reports on performance and good experience with getting damaged units repaired.Mine arrived in perfect condition.... works great and compared to typical diaphragm compressors is FAR quieter.... motor runs at ~1700 RPM rather than 3600 RPM which contributes to quietness.This compressor is no light weight but it is not too heavy to carry for short distances and the weigh is part of the reason it is so quiet and likely very durable. The components, air fittings, and other parts are high quality.I read reviews of numerous compressors and all the comparisons led me to this model as the best choice.... it IS! You will not be disappointed in this unit!"
4,quiet quality,"My compressor arrived in perfect shape. I added the oil to the compressor pump,removed the plastic plug on the intake for the pump and opened the ball valveto let the compressor run for 20 minutes with no load as per the break in instructions.So far the compressor has been exactly as I had expected it to be from the reviewsI had read. It runs much quieter than any other compressor that I have experienced.It refills very quickly and provides sufficient power for what I need. It is heavyfor a small compressor, but that is the tradeoff for a quality pump that should lastforever for the average homeowner."
5,Makita Compressor,Forget the oil free pancake compressors - this is the one for the weekend warrior or the multi-tasking renovator\contractor. Buy the twin stack if you have heavier use and don't mind the extra weight.
1,Received damaged compressor twice!!!,"The first compressor the regulator was broken from the tank fitting and pushed into the plastic motor shroud. The replacement compressor, plastic motor shroud was broken on both sides. There was probably underlying damage, didnt want to risk potential problems in the future..was returned for a refund. I gave up on receiving one undamaged."
3,Overall quality,Compressor seems to be built well however it takes a really long time for the pressure to build up. If you plan on using it for anything other than just pumping up a tire now and then I wouldn't recommend it.
5,Nice Compressor - Reasonable Quite,"I purchased this on a trail Prime membership (which I have since kept), so I got this with free two day shipping... seems criminal.This was the best rated small compressor I found, and it was not available locally. I use this around the house, small furniture / trim jobs / repair. I do not use this as an everyday tool, in case any pros are reading.It works great for my needs, and is not as loud as I remember these being when I was working with them a decade or so ago."
5,Makita MAC700 air compressor,"Received the compressor in perfect condition. Followed the directions and started the compressor for the break in period and then started using it. Meets my expectations (shop work and filling tires on my class A RV). I'm a Carpenter by trade, now retired, and it works fine with all my nailers and staplers. This thing is very quiet. I've never been around a compressor with this kind of volume that is this quiet. I purchased it because I wanted something that was oil filled because in my expierence the oiless models don't hold up as well."
4,Nice unit - arrived AOK,"Unit arrived perfect. The factory box has been beefed up. No damage.This is one small machine but I am very pleased with it. Dont try to run any power tools with it, but for general air needs it works nice!"
5,"Portable, quiet compressor","I've used this compressor for a 1 1/2 years. It's light enough to be portable, small enough to fit in the van nicely, powerful enough for anything short of full-time 2-gun framing, and the quietest I've every had. What more could you want for an everyday compressor?"
5,Fine air compressor,"I read quite a few reviews on this and other compressors. I decided to buy this one. I am very happy with it (Low noise level, light weight, quick recharge."
5,Excellent little compressor,This is my first compressor purchase. I researched a ton of compressors and I couldn't stray away from makita quality. I used it for tires and blowing out water lines. It worked just the way I wanted it too. The unit is quiet so working in the house won't be a problem. I'm gonna buy a 10 gallon tank to hook up to it since the 2 gallon is a little small for me. But the unit recovers very quickly.
1,Arrived broken,I ordered this as a refurb and it appears new...except for the broken elbow like everyone else has already reported. Called Makita and they said to send it back to vendor (at my expense...yeah right) or go to authorized repair facility. I'm going to take my chances and try to repair it myself. Google for 'unloading elbow' and find that part for about seven and change. The check valve is about seventeen.
1,Great price and shipping but it doesn't work.,Bought the Makita MAC700 for a great price and free shipping. Ordered it on Monday and had it on Friday. It arrived in great condition with no damage as reported quite often in other reviews. Never got through the break in before it stopped working. Let it set and finally got it to run again by continuely turning it off and on. Pumped it up and bleed off the pressure and it would not cycle back on without recycling the on/off switch multipile times. It seemed like the piston was tight so I reran the break in again. Worked properly once and started freezing up again. At least Amazon has a great return policy. Will drop it off at UPS tomorrow. I love Makita products but I am giving this one a miss.
2,Arrived broken,"On unpacking, the plastic face of the oil reservoir was cracked. Unit is unusable so returning for refund. Will buy one locally tomorrow. A low price is not a good deal when the product arrives broken."
4,air compressor,The Makita it's self is great. My complaint is with the broken upload valve on arrival. The unit was packaged well and no damage to the box in shipment. This means the valve was broke when placed into the box. They did send a replacement but still with the unit being dead on arrival leaves a poor impression. Once running it does the job.
5,Great compressor,"This is a great little compressor with good output for the price. It is very quiet running.Mine arrived with a broken part which was no fault of the manufacturer, but they prompted sent me a replacement part without a problem. This does weigh 50# so it is a bit heavier than some, but well worth it."
5,"Quality built, quick recharge, a titan among small compressors...","In the few months of ownership this little compressor has worked quite well. Lets face it your not painting a house with it. This is a premium grade portable compressor for nailing, tires, ect.. Won't work (well) for any type of auto wrench ect. I believe its rated at 1-2 framers 1-2 other nailers. Id expect it to recharge each tire you'd fill on a car ""haven't tried yet"".Pro:Solid Built (Oiled)Quick RechargeQuietHasn't blown any breakers !!Quality fittings and gauges.Cons:Heavy 50+lbs (call this titan class)Could be 3 gallonCould have more then a 50% duty cycle.Top heavyTo give a quick run down of what to expect. At full charge (130psi) and reg at 90psi. 18g nailer will run about 18 nails before recharge. 16gauge will run about 15 nails. A framer is going to do alot less. I think i saw a video of 7 before it recharged. But for general 1-2 person use how fast are you working?"
4,MAC700 Air Compressor,"This unit arrived on time and in good condition. I briefly read through the manual, attached the air filter, added oil and turned it on. Initially I was very pleasantly surprised by how quiet it sounded compared to my previous units (one was an oiless Porter Cable pancake unit, and the other one was a small oiled unit. I actually compared the sound levels with a meter that I have, and I received readings of about 85 dB at arms length. While this wasn't that much quieter than other units, I think since this one runs at only 1750 RPM, it SEEMS much quieter. The noise is definitely not as abrasive. It pumps up fairly quickly, and holds pressure. I also like the ball valve for emptying the tank after each use. I am very pleased with this unit and would recommend it."
5,hot dog!,"I just cannot understand the negative reviews for this great little compressor. I am a remodeling contractor and have had this little guy on the job as my only compressor for the last year or so. It is quick and quiet to cycle, can keep up with all but the most rapid-fire nailing (we only use one gun per compressor), and is very portable. It is a little heavy, but compact and so far, for me, practically maintenance-free. I have changed the oil once, a ten-minute job, though I doubt it really needed it. I got a great price on it at the time, and I am sorry I didn't order two. The 90 degree turn valve to drain it is the simplest I have ever seen. If you carry it in the back of your truck, be sure to tie it down."
3,"Received Item, but can't use it yet.","Based on other reviews, I'd have probably agreed and given this item 5 stars. BUT, because of the poor packaging, and the probable mishandling by UPS, the Unloading Valve was broken off inside the main Check Valve. These to pieces are located on the side of the unit, right next to the outer wall of the cardboard shipping box. So, if this package was dropped on its side, which very likely, it would receive this type of damage. C'mon guys, properly package this stuff SO IT WON'T GET DAMAGED!!"
5,So far So good,"Very quite operation, used to put up a partial fence. I did have to wait for it to recharge air a little at times but I expected that,big gun lots of nails. Easy to tote around for projects around the house. No more trying to drag an air hose from the garage to the far parts of the House. Can't give a long term review because I have only had it about a month. I am not going to use it to make my living just help out around my place for that, it's what I need. I just have to remember to check the oil .Thanks Makita for such a nice small compressor.Just an update after using this for a while now, I still couldn't be happier. This Small compressor is awesome. This and a 25ft hose is all you need for your do it yourself jobs. Quiet operation indoors"
2,Disappointed,The compressor (my first) fills VERY slowly and the pressure drops after only filling a car tire...maybe im doing something wrong but my construction friends had the same thoughts. Runs quietly but is frustrating and Im disappointed in the performance.
5,Best little compressor I have found,"I use this compressor for remodel work and it is fantastic. Clients love it because it is QUIET on the job. It is well built, reasonably priced and reliable. Air volume is even adequate to hopper gun wall texture. It is heavy and you must tie it up for travel as due to design it will topple over the first turn you make, but this is the compressor I take to the jobs (I also have a Porter Cable pancake, Binks hot dog and a larger Campbell Hausfeld). I have even had customers buy this unit after using it at their homes. I also have the larger 2.5 HP MAC2400 that I use at my shop and it is also fantastic, just bigger, heavier and more air volume."
5,Well worth the added cost,"I was debating if the added cost over C***sm** would be worth it. Though it was ~$80 more, I can say that it clearly is a great unit. It was packaged real well (contrary to some other reviews) and arrived in great shape. There will be some oil leakage in the box, this is from manufacturing startup and testing - it shouldn't concern you at all. Just add the oil provided and go through the break in procedures thoroughly. Personally, I went through multiple break in cycles, with cool down time between them. An investment like this will need a bit of TLC, but will serve you well.Highly recommended, Amazon again, provided everything in great condition and one day ahead of schedule.Well pleased."
5,"A bit heavy, but flawless","Purchased this compressor for home use 1 year ago at a GREAT price from Amazon with free shipping. It arrived unscathed with everything I needed.It has been used continually for flooring installations using a Fremont floor nailer and other air tools with no problems.It is fairly heavy and not something I'd want to carry up a ladder every day, and it does tend to ""walk"" around the room while in operation, but otherwise, it's the perfect compact compressor and I fully expect it to last as long as the last Makita tool I had (a cordless drill I still have that is >20 years old)."
5,Great Compressor,"Just got this compressor yesterday and I've already put it through the paces. I'm not sure if I got lucky or if a disproportionate amount of people feel compelled to write the negative reviews based on shipping damage; anyway, mine arrived just fine. This is quite possibly the best compressor value for less than $200. The build quality is excellent; near Rol-Air quality for 1/3 less. For those of you used to a oilless compressor this one almost sounds like a whisper. For you trim carpenters or weekend warriors, you will not be disappointed."
4,Great little compressor,I have had this compressor a little over a month now. It has been used heavily during a remodel project. It is lite enough to move around which was essential for me. It is one of the quietist small compressors I have been around. You can talk to someone while it is cycling and hear the conversation. It hands down beats any oiless model I've worked with. It has plenty of capacity to handle most all of my needs when it comes to nailers. I have even been using my framing nailer with it. It would not stand up to rapid use with a framer but I do not work that fast as I am usually working alone. I only gave this unit a four star rating because of the packaging. Many of the reviews I read described the packaging as poor and the unit arrived damaged. Well mine was definitely packaged poorly and the plastic motor shroud was cracked. This was purely cosmetic to me and I needed to use the compressor so I didn't bother with it. This is definitely its one downfall.
3,shipping damage again,Makita MAC700 The Hotdog 12.4 Amp 2 Horsepower 2.6 Gallon Oiled Single Hotdog CompressorI just received this and the plastic shroud was fractured. I was also concerned that there was oil all over the inside of the box. It is supposed to ship dry. Was it a refurb? I have had good luck with Amazon with the exception of heavy packages. UPS distribution centers have drops. It is well understood that the drivers union does not like heavy packages. They should ship these FEDEX. I have been a major UPS shipper for the last 19 years. I hope my replacement is in better shape.
4,Makita MAC700 Big Bore,"""I have used this very little so far. However, I'm impressed by how quiet it is. It seems like a very good unit and worth the money."""
3,"great compressor,bad shipping","after reading all the reviews i settled on this compressor as it seemed perfect for my garages smaller jobs. the compressor has not disappointed,it is very quiet and seems to be an excellent product. i was concerned about the reviews about damage in the shipping process. sure enough mine arrived with a crack in the plastic housing,unbelievable that a company like amazon would not get this corrected. i didnt feel it mechanically effected my compressor so i was not going to go through the hassle of sending it back.i think it is an outstanding compressor with real shipping issues!!"
5,Industrial Quality,"I received this compressor from Amazon yesterday and with great apprehension, I opened the box somewhat expecting shipping damage but there wasn't a scratch on it. I have specified and installed air compressors and air dryers for years in industrial applications and the quality of this compressor rivals any I have seen. Very solid construction and assembled with quality components. I followed the instructions for break-in, the pressure settings were pre-set and there were no leaks. The unit is heavy but I would prefer that over being too light and not staying put when in operation. I found the owner's manual to be well written and together with the exploded-view diagragm, I have all of the information I need for this unit. The MAC700 has a quality touch to it and with proper maintenance should last a lifetime."
3,Not a bad compresser,"After reading the reviews about all the broken gauges I thought i would get lucky and get a good one, but not so the gauge was broken. I didn't want to mess with it so just went to the hardware store and found one that would fit.I am a fan of Makita, but will think twice before buying from them again. After all bad reviews about broken gauges you would think makita would pull their heads out and fix it."
5,A great little compressor,"I waited anxiously to see if there was going to be damage from shipment. No problem. Unit was intact and worked fine. The weight is not too heavy IMO. Heavy enough to not vibrate and move while on, but light enough to move around the house.Regarding noise level, it's not too noisy. I can hear it in the house when it turns on in the garage, so it (like all compressors) is not ""quiet"". But I can be in the garage with the pump on and don't get irritated by too much noise.Overall...I am big fan of Makita tools and this one is no exception. Worth the money."
4,Awesome compressor/shipping damage,Love the compressor. Powerful enough for general purpose duties. The most quiet compressor you will find. Had broken fitting from shipping. Contacted Amazon. Amazon told me to contact the manufacturer. Manufacturer had me contact a local Makita repair shop which claimed that Makita would not reimberse him for the part. Ended up going to hardware store for replacement
2,2 stars because of horrible Makita customer support,"I purchased this air compressor from Amazon. I received it yesterday. This morning when I went to use it I noticed the quick disconnect on the compressor wouldn't allow the hose to be securely attached. I called Makita and they said the coupler was defective, that I need to return the compressor to Amazon for a replacement. They refused to send me the small replacement part so I could use the compressor. I had to send back a 52 lb compressor to get the right part. I went down to Home Depot and bought the $5 part myself to keep from having to send this compressor back. Any other company would overnight the replacement part to help a customer. I will not purchase Makita again!"
2,We will revisit the stars after it gets fixed!,"Similar to several other posts, mine arrived with a cracked shroud, and yes, the instructions are awful. Perhaps you should not put all the included oil in - or maybe you should. Does the sight glass red dot indicate its time to fill it, or does it indicate that it's full? The world wonders.The other negative feature that is new to this thread: mine arrived with a broken tank pressure guage. We will revisit the thread after seeing how Makita takes care of things.And yes, it is quiet - that part is very nice."
2,nothing to get hot under the collar about,"If you positively prick with perspiration at the possibility of perusing popular pablum previously published in close propinquity with the plentifully pulchritudinous pussycats of Playboy, please procure this book presently. If, on the other hand, you just want to read some damned good stories, then pass on this also ran and get instead:Her Smoke Rose Up Forever. Triptree will blow you away."
5,Beautiful Pictures,Wonderful glossy full spread pictures of the beautiful grasses and flowers. Makes you want to live on the prairie!!I loved seeing the pictures of Laura and her family. I am sure my sisters are going to love this book too.I also liked the extra tidbits of information. Even has quotes from some unpublished books written by Laura.My review is not the best just wanted to give the book another 5 stars.
2,This is really boring unless you like a documentary,"My family found this to be really boring and if you have read all of the Tolkien books and seen the movie, that is about all you need to do."
4,So far so good,"I bought the watch about 3 months ago. When I got it, I thought it might be bigger and heavier than I'd like. Within a day I was used to it. Keeps good time and looks good. Have gotten a lot of positive comments on it."
4,Great purchase,"I was a bit skeptical purchasing this watch, especially with not being able to physically see it and try it on first. But I was very impressed when it arrived.This watch is ""sharp"". A little heavy, but is a masculine piece that reflects quality workmanship. I've received compliments from friends and business clients as well. It has great lines, and can be worn in a casual or elegant setting. The clasp was different from the description, as explained in several other reviews, but it is surprisingly secure, and convenient to take on and off. The faceplate is different from the picture, but still looks great (silver in color rather than white). It's easy to set, and is not too bulky. My only criticism is the size of the back-up power button located beside the winding device. It is a bit large, and could have been a bit smaller, or concealed in a different way. Other than that, I'm very pleased.I would recommend this item."
3,great style but too painful to wear,"I love the style of the watch. Kinetic keeps the battery charged and you never have to worry about opening the case and replacing the battery. However, I cannot wear it since the band keeps pulling my arm hair as the watch moves around my wrist. I've resorted to putting a piece of tape underside of the band."
5,What I expected,I had already looked at a similar watch (with a blue face) at a Navy exchange for $315.00. This wtach is a great value for the money. It is heavy (as expected) but stylish.
3,NARUTO!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT UP?!,"I Would Like Viz Media To start putting these on blu-ray or box sets but these are good to collect. If You Finishing Things then try to stick with Naruto throughout even though it has filler. Because what is after that...is something incredible...something EPIC...something inspiring, amazing, so - Or you could just call it ""Naruto: Shippuden"" PEACE!"
5,The More Gaara The Better!,"My favorite character in Naruto is Gaara, so I like it when he's in the story. Even though this isn't part of the original story line, I'm happy they decided to put him in a least a part of the fillers. yes and Gaara's fight is the best fight out of all of the filler episodes. yes the filler's dragged on and it felt like I was seeing the same thing over and over with different characters but this was a great closing to all the dragging on. I was just basically going through the motion watching all of this b/c I love Naruto I have to watch alllll the episodes so I stuck with box set 11 through 16 and my eyes finally got bigger as soon as GAARA OF THE DESERT appeared."
5,Way more than satisfied,"This was the best deal ever. I was extemely sketchy at first because of the low price. I thought there was no one this was legit. But I read other reviews and gave it a shot. Wow! I got a Brand new Seiko watch with the 3 year factory warranty for 1/4 of the price. It came in a seiko box, with the watch sitting on a little seiko pillow. It even had the original seiko price tag on it, so my man thinks that is what I paid. SSsshhhh!!!! The package arrived in excellent condition and it got here in half of the estimated ship time. I was more than impressed. I definitely recommend this site to anyone."
4,Seiko Men's Kinetic Watch #SKA096,"Really nice looking watch and comfortable to wear. The only gripe I have is that the fastener is easily undone should you move your wrist at an angle. It has happened to me when driving, which is a concern, but apart from this a really nice watch at an astounding price."
4,Excellent timepiece,"This watch is very attractive and has worked very well so far. I didn't give it the fifth star only because:a)the retailer (Watchzone) included instructions for the wrong watch models, which was very confusing until I got a PDF version of the correct instructions off the internet.b)The links in the band are very large, such that it is difficult to get a precise fit to one's wrist (it is slightly too big for me , but taking out one pair of links would make it too small)."
3,The Big Burn!,"It is nice to see Letter Never Sent given the deluxe treatment, but this is not one of Kalatosov's better works. Sure, it is stylish with many intriguing cinematic techniques employed, especially as a fire sweeps across the Siberian taiga, in which these four Soviet geologists find themselves in pursuit of diamond veins for the state government. It struck me as a purely ideologically driven film, as opposed to his masterpiece,The Cranes are Flying (The Criterion Collection), which captured the humanity of Soviet citizens as WWII closed in around them.There is plenty of tension with the geological team forced to flee a raging forest fire after several weeks of mineral exploration, but it is hard to feel much empathy as it seems Kalatosov and Urusevsky were more interested in visual effects. I suppose this is partly due to the censorship at the time. The map becomes paramount in this film, not the characters. There are much better films to be had by this great Soviet filmmaker."
4,Not for everyone,"I found this film to be enjoyable from an aesthetic standpoint. The cinematography was done really well, as the back cover of the dvd states, featuring ""one daring shot after another."" That being said, the story was a bit weak. Not that there wasn't one, it was just told in a manner different from what most films use. It was more about character development and inner struggles than interpersonal drama."
3,Excellent cinematography...,"Stunning cinematography and art direction. Camera angles, lighting, everything breathtaking. The plot was rather thin, though, so I dropped it to three stars. It didn't go very deep at all, but still a pleasure to watch."
1,Trash...is trash. Perfect title.,"TRASH is exactly that...trash. And that is where it landed ... in the trash bin. I enjoy short stories and reading the other ""glowing"" reviews posted on Amazon...I expected so much more. I did not expect ""Lesbian Porn""...even though I don't mind lesbian literature if it's written well. Yet, since this was written many years ago, I will give the author some leeway. However, after reading some negative reviews of her most recent book, I will not bother to purchase that one either. I'm hoping Ms. Allison redeems herself in the future with more interesting characters and less filler."
4,Not just lesbian fiction,"Trash is a great book of short stories written by Dorothy Allison. Although she the winner of book awards for lesbian fiction, her stories also tell of a tragic childhood, growing up as white trash, and of a family life involving alcholism, abuse and tragedy. The stories are difficult to read at times, due to the agonizing adversity the she has faced, but it is peppered with comic relief, sarcasm and wit."
3,Harrowing and emotionally exhausting to read,"Dorothy Allision's ""Trash' is a collection of essays and loosely connected anecdotes about being born into, growing up in, and surviving a horrific childhood in a white trash community in America. The stories recall nightmares you wouldn't wish on your enemies. Allison writes with such bitterness, anger and ferocity it's frightening. I found it a tough read and had to tackle it a bit at a time. The essays/stories are not all compelling. Some I found esoteric and skipped. The earlier ones like ""River of Names"" were mostly excellent. The later ones which tell of Allison's voyage of sexual self discovery were harder to get through. It's not the graphic sex that's hard to handle but the emotional landscape that's alien to those outside the community she writes of. Personally, I found ""Trash"" an unpleasant read and while I respect Allsion's integrity, she's obviously not going to be everybody's cup of tea."
4,The final story...,"I really loved this book - it grabbed me from the beginning to end. Its so much more than ""lesbian fiction"". The last story where her mother dies, had me cold. It really made me feel so depressed and sad that I had to call home just to hear a voice I knew. That part...its harrowing."
4,Great book of short stories.,"I really enjoyed this book. I'm not much on reading generally, but Allison has a great writing style that's completely relatable and yet so poetic and beautiful. This book is about women, and I especially recommend it to readers interested in feminism, gender studies, LGBTQ issues, etc."
5,"Very nice glass, and it definitely improves the flavor","I use these glasses to drink cognac, whiskey, grand marnier, and of course scotch. When I first received them, I was curious to see if these glasses made a difference for scotch/whiskey and did some tests. This glass along with cognac, champagne flute, old fashioned, and shot glasses were used. This glass seemed to be best for scotches that have a sweeter undertone and smoother, peppery odor. I preferred the cognac glass for scotches that had very open, lighter fragrance."
4,Tales from the Dallas Cowboys,This was a gift for my dad for Christmas. He has already read it and thought it was a good book about some of the history of The Dallas Cowboys
4,Tales from the Dallas Cowboys,Thought the book was entertaining. Of course I am a Dallas Cowboys fan. Don't know if a redskin or giant fan would have liked it as much. Thought the book was well written. There were a few mis-spelled words.
5,A Grand Adventure!,"Lael Arrington has written a masterpiece! With high adventure, suspense, intrigue, and creative plot twists, the reader is instantly captured by the story of Chris, a young man who is on a quest for meaning in Pilgrim's Progress Today. The plot is reminiscent of the first journey Pilgrim took, but Lael brilliantly transposes this trip into modern times, and ""identity points"" that all of us can personalize. Whether young or old, this book should be read by every Christian who is seeking a life worth living in God's Grand Story!"
3,Its ok book,The book overall makes a child remember how to do addition through the repetition. I am not sure whether the child fundamental understands the concept of addition. The fundamentals have to be explained first and then this can be supplemented for practice purposes.
4,Excellent for pre-schoolers and as a refresher for those about to begin kindergarten,"My husband and I have been working on reading and math with our daughter who is to begin kindergarten this fall. When I purchased this book, I thought it would involve more than what it actually is, but that's my mistake as I did not read the description. The front cover clearly states this book focuses on adding numbers 1 and 2 to the numbers 1 through 29. I had expected more than this as my daughter is already familiar with these numbers and concepts, but like I said, this is my mistake. That being said, this is an excellent refresher course and a great beginning math book for preschoolers.The book starts off with some basic tracing and fill in the numbers type exercises but this is followed up with drill type exercises of addition. It makes for great practice. Another winner from Kumon."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 4year old Nephew. The 100 little pieces came in a plastic bag with the words ""Knights Market Stand"" on it. Since he can't read he won't even know what it is supposed to be after it is put together. Spending that amount of money should at least get me a box with a picture on it!!!"
5,Very Entertaining Tale,"This is a very good western mystery and the cast is very entertaining. I like the Johnson's writing better than C J Box, which can get a little sappy. hard to believe this is his first novel.The specifics of the book has been amply reviewed, but I have two observations: One, it's unfortunate but it's so very unlikely a county Sheriff and a Native American (a tribe member would never refer to him/herself as a Native American) on the rez would be bosom buddies. That cultural reality aside, it seems that all the little town's inhabitants have the same dry sense of humor. It's just a witty little oasis out there in Wyoming's hinterlands! But that's cool. Wouldn't be very interesting if everyone was just saying ""Yep."""
3,Cold Dish is luke warm,I really liked the general writing of this book. The picture I got of Wyoming was real. I was born in Wyoming and a lot of the descriptions in the book made me feel like I had gone home. I could just feel all of the small Wyoming community come through.The story line was mostly good. Only the ending was not consistent with the flavor of the story. It was almost like the author got close to his deadline and finished just to finish.
2,plot was a tad weak,"I was able to put the book down to read later. It was not an urgent page- turner to find out who done it. But, I did enjoy all the character developments, and the story location."
1,Cold Dish,The language in this book is awful. I think you can write without using such language. I didn't finish the book!.
1,disappointed in longmire,too slow mooving. like the tv series. book not as good.give me jack reacher or Mitch Rapp any time
3,Okay,Got this book for my husband because he loves the TV series. He is also a huge fan of the CJ Box series. He does not want the rest of the series because he says it has too much fowl language and is not a fan of the writing style.
5,Good Book,I became intersted in Craig Johnson's work when I found the Longmire series on the television. I looked him up on my Kindle and haven't looked back. I read this book every chance as I have it availible on my smartphone. The mystery starts out on the first page and Craig keeps you hooked on every page after that. You won't go wrong picking up this book and reading.
5,the cold dish,first book i have read of craig johnson but it will not be the last.Great book and love the characters!
4,Good read!,Finished this book in two days. Something different what with the Native American spiritual involvement. Liked it enough that I'm looking up more books by this author.
3,Interesting,"While the writing was not always clear in this book and the story sometimes dragged, it was an entertaining read and fun to get to know new characters in what looks to be a good series. What I think I like the most (other than Walt being an alumni at the same school as I went to) is the fact that the author is not afraid to tackle things that aren't seen in mainstream mysteries such as non christian spirituality. The chapter about the Old Cheyenne was beautiful. I can't wait to see how these characters grow and change."
3,Longmire's way to adminstering law,"I am a fan of the Longmire Series. So I've read a couple of the books. ""The Cold Dish"" is an pretty good read, but not what I would term a great read. Actually I enjoy the TV version more."
5,Great!,"Great story! I love the tv series and said ""why not"". Walt is a bad ass, enough said. Such great characters in the story and a great storyline. It just keeps moving along. A real easy read!"
4,mystery,"I seldom read a writer who has a tv show based upon their work, however this writer is worth a read. I will follow the books and the tv series as well. It is a well written book."
4,A Cold Dish: A Walt Longmire Mystery,"This book is complex and engaging. The characters are real people with emotional depth. It is one of those books that keeps you wrestling with clues. I felt the cold deep in my bones and the action was exhausting. Craig Johnson really knows how to create characters that you care about including their weaknesses, bad moods and mistakes."
5,A different read for me...,"I'm usually a cozy mystery reader. I picked up this book because I had watched the Walt Longmire series on TV and liked it. I have to say I loved this book. Even though it was a story line that was done on the TV show... it was so much more complete and interesting in the book. Also, you get so much more in-depth knowledge about Walt's relationship with other characters. And humour! Who knew there was so much to giggle at while reading Walt Longmire stories? I'm hooked."
4,The Cold Dish,"Loved the book, mostly because of the characters and the country. very easy reading. Enjoyed the second book Death Without Company and am ready to get the third."
2,I JUST COULDN'T GET INTO IT!!,"SHERIFFS, GUNS, INDIANS, MURDERS, GUNS, MOUNTAINS, GLIB DIALOGUE---IT HAD IT ALL!!! TOO BAD THAT IT JUST DIDN'T CLICK FOR ME--SORRY.AAANNNDDD I REALLY ENJOY READING ABOUT INDIANS & THEIR BELIEFS---HANDEDDOWN THRU HISTORY----SOME OF THE INDIAN PARTS OF THIS BOOK SEEMEDPRETTY HOKEY---AGAIN---SORRY---I COULDN'T BUY INTO IT!!PARTS OF THIS BOOK WERE VERY GOOD---OTHERS PRETTY STINKY---THUS THE LOW RATING."
2,The Cold Dish,"I have enjoyed the TV series, Longmire, & I thought the books on which the series is based would be as good or better than the series. However, I was very disappointed by the language in the book. My experience is people do not use that kind of language in everyday conversation. It is not necessary in order to tell a good story. Consequently, I will not be purchasing anymore of the Walt Longmire Mysteries by Craig Johnson."
5,Pull an All-Nighter,"I read many pre-publication copies of novels, but this one stands out as a can't-put-it-down mystery. Craig Johnson's pacing, character development, humor, and description set The Cold Dish apart from most stories and mark Johnson as an author to watch. I hope he has the next Sheriff Walt Longmire story written. I'm ready and waiting. Of course, I'll have to reread The Cold Dish first."
5,The Cold Dish,Great read. Now I know why it became a TV Series. Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
4,pretty good read,I found this book to be entertaining and a good read. They're is some great story elements and some funny lines as well. Worth your time and money.
4,Interesting Characters,"Not my usual read, but I liked the Longmire TV series, and decided to try the book. There is a lot more humor in the book than the show, but that's ok. The book would be really dark otherwise. Good story, told in first person, not my favorite, hence four stars. I would recommend for any mystery reader. A good way to spend a rainy afternoon."
4,An engrossing read,My first experience with Craig Johnson and I will definitely read other books written by him. The story kept me wondering right up until the end. His command of the English is excellent in my view and I loved his descriptions all along the way.Very good book.
4,DIFFERENT FROM THE TV SHOW,NOT ONLY WAS THE MURDER WEAPON DIFFERENT BUT SO WAS THE KILLER. IT TOOK SEVERAL CHAPTERS BEFORE I REALIZED THAT I HAD SEEN THIS SHOW ON TV
5,book,I watched the television show and I became interested in reading the books which the show is based on. Both the book and the tv show are good.
3,Well done western,Character development excellentI cared about the people involvedStory line was too slow to developeand the ending was depressing.
4,Rank Cologne's take,"Woah. SLOW DOWN!!! Everbody RELAX! I've read this book and enjoyed it, but five frickin' stars across the board? That would make it an instant classic. This is not The Great Gatsby. This is a very well-written, entertaining mystery novel.I'd say the thing I enjoyed most about it is the writer's style...a nice rhythm to his sentences. Another thing that struck me was the descriptions of landscape. I get the feeling that if Johnson wrote a nonfiction nature book it would be something special. Why I wouldn't give this book five stars, besides that it's not The Great Gatsby, is that some of the humor falls flat to me. Some of it is spot on. But that said, I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a high-quality novel who is not looking for a book that's going to change their life. Johnson is the real thing... looking foward to his next book."
3,Dialogue flow needs.....,"a little work. Although the plot, characters and overall flavor of the book were great, I had trouble following who was saying what. I had to go back and readdress the paragraph heading to see who was speaking. Evidently, Craig's editor wanted a clean narrative without all the ""... the sheriff said."" But I got to tell you, it was work for a small brain like mine to keep the narrative flowing as I was reading. I may read a second book just to see if Craig has modified his writing style."
4,Longmire,"The largest city with no police force. I like to think of it that way, but then the stories wouldn't be as much fun. Always a good read. Sure gets injured a lot, should carry his own med kit."
5,Walt and his gang are terrific,"I bought this book as a gift after reading all of the series myself. I think this may be one of the best by Craig Johnson, even though it is the first. I am confident the recipient of the gift will be happy to have found something that is a bit different from your normal mystery novel."
4,I like it,Would like to read more with this cast of characters. Interesting people involved in interesting things. Here are 4 more words.
4,Great setting and characters.,I liked this book. Very easy read and good storyline. The characters were excellent. Descriptions of west are good. Thanks
4,Avid Reader,"I found Craig Johnson after looking for a new book by another author. I really enjoyed the book.Amazon's ""people who bought this book also bought"" I find this Amazon section very helpful in finding new reading material"
4,the cold dish,i read the cold dish and enjoyed it very much. I did find it started off rather slow but then it got intriging and I couldn't wait to finish it.I did find it rather interesting as I was raised in Wyoming and now live in Montana. He incorporated both states into his story as it mainly all took place in Wyoming. For someone not being around this area they wouldn't know the difference. I am anxiously awaiting to get another book written by Craig.
5,WALT,Loved the book. Arrived on time and in great shape. Found a great new character in Walt. Thanks
4,Nice product,"Love the fit and style. Better price than most other options and it offers better protection. Could do without the button for the clip on the back, but this is a nitpick since I never feel it when I am wearing it."
5,Excellent Book! Best book to date on Microsoft CMS.,Book is laid out very well. Plenty of practical examples which you can try as you read the book and implement a demo site. Goes far beyond any other book in explaining the CMS PAPI (Publishing API). Only grouse: It is written in C# which seems to be the norm for most CMS sites but in my implementation I use VB.Net although translating to vb.net is very easy.I've interacted with the Authors (Stefan Gossner and Mei Ying) through the microsoft.public.cmserver.general news group for several of my problems and they are very knowledgable in the CMS product. I dont know them personally though! If you want to learn CMS2002 in detail this book is worth the buy.
2,No replacement gasket!,"The blender is okay, it really isn't that great, but when I broke my rubber gasket, I found that there AREN'T ANY REPLACEMENT GASKETS AVAILABLE. There are rubber gasket replacements for every other blender ever, but I absolutely can't find one for this blender.I called the manufacturer, they told me the gaskets were on back order and would be available in 5 or 6 weeks, and they would contact me to order one at that time. Meanwhile, I bought an Oster blender for $2 at a yard sale, and it is AWESOME.I have since called and emailed the manufacturer with NO RESPONSE. I am pretty sure the ""5 to 6 week back-order"" was just a way to get me off the phone, and that there are in fact no replacement parts at all (check out their website, they don't even have blenders on it)."
2,not sturdy enough!,i have had this blender for about 7 months now and already the gasket on it had given away. it sprung a minor leak first and then it totally leaked... unusable. i opened it up and tinkered with it. i took out all the rusted washers and not so good gasket and changed it with premium parts. works alright now. i am giving two stars because it should not have gone bad with in a year since i don't use it much also because the jug is very sturdy and motor is OK.
4,HORROR/SCIFI AT ITS BEST!!!THE VOSLOO FAN talks too much,"This is a great movie, even for those of us who are smart enough not to believe in little green men from Mars. How can you go wrong with this movie, especially if you are a Gordon/Yuzna fan. Great script, great director, great actors...you would be insane not to give it at least three stars."
1,a colossal waste of time,"What the hell is wrong with all you people! this was the biggest waste of tape i have ever seen. not only did they cheat us out of plot, they cheated us on gore. Amazon is selling this giant turd of film for $103.99. Who would buy ""Progeny,"" a retarded attempt at sci-fi...or is it horror....or is it a sappy romance with soap opera-like actors....whatever it is Brian Yuzna can shove it up his pootie tang. don't rent it and sure as hell don't buy it. i will now cry tears of sorrow for my two dollars..."
3,Above Average.,"""Progeny"" is one of Horror Meister Yuzna's less gory attempts which includes some fine special effects but a weak plot. The actors do a great job, especially Brad Dourif. Arnold Vosloo (The Mummy& The Mummy Returns) is Craig Barton, the surgeon who is sure that his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) has been impregnated by evil aliens. The movie does have a few surprises and carries out an uncanny mood. Recommended for strong horror buffs."
5,Almost as good as from scratch,"Easy to make, this cook and serve is perfect for people who want tapioca quickly and don't want a lot of extra ingredients around."
5,Love the Jell-O Tapioca Pudding,"I ordered this from Amazon after reading other reviews and I'm glad I did! The pudding is really easy to make, just add skim milk and stir on medium heat for a few minutes and you have delicious pudding ready. I let it cool for a little while longer than mentioned on the pack as this makes the pudding thicker and more tasty."
3,"The best of the bunch, but that's faint praise","Finally after a move to T.V. and a lower budget, they caught the creepy feel of the book and put a few chills into this one. Without the fx's to fall back on they went for the ""thing's unseen"" approach and it did the film all the better for it. Now the bad news, this is a one time only film, as all the others would use the fx's approach and laps into silly jokes."
4,Classic,This is a classic movie and a good turn on the Amityville series. Not the best in the franchise by far but a classic non-the-less.
1,ANOTHER WASTE OF A GREAT HORROR FILM,IT WAS A POORLY WRITTEN TERRIBLY ACTED TV FILM THEAT FOLLOWED NONE OF THE PROTOCOL. THE LAMP REALLY? THE CAT EVIL MADE IN 1990 NO SEQUEL?
1,Criminally short life span,I have had this monitor for about 18 monts. 3 weeks ago the monitor started blacking out. I cut the brightness and that seemed to work for about another week and then it started blacking out again. Thank you for everyone who posted their problems with this monitor so I know this is a manufacturing default.
2,Died after a year,"Was okay while it lasted, but we bought the monitor in June 2005 and it is now dead (in July 2006). Very disappointing.The monitor comes on for a few seconds and then goes off. It is exactly what is described in HP's product alert ""HP Pavilion f1703 LCD Monitor - Intermittent Video, No Video, No Backlight"" except that their replacement only covers monitors manufactured from October 2003 through June 2004. Despite the fact that it appears to be exactly the same problem which they apparently didn't fix in later revisions, they will not replace or repair our monitor, so it is now useless.For this reason I recommend staying away from this product."
4,"HP Pavilion F1703 , 17"" LCD Monitor","The monitor works good,pixels and all around show nice images,What to know before purchaseIf want to buy this item ,make sure to get ac adapter and power cable as costsabout 30 dlls for both,and basic speakers for about 15 dllsWorse :the product come without ac adapter,no power cables and no speakers that shows in produt description to buy so means is a bad trade:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000A039V/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title125.89 dlls I'd pay for 2 lcd monitors only,plus30 dlls on ac adapter and power cable15 dlls on speakers,sume170.89 dlls,Could get those items for less money with all stuffs in description.Resuming: It's a good monitor,just make sure to read all seller(not amazon)description before buy it.Product is recomended."
4,Nothing Bad to Say,"I could not see any difference between this and most monitors. The feature that makes this monitor worth the extra $50-$75 than a generic monitor is the ease and range of the tilting screen. You can adjust the monitor to be perfect if you are standing up, sitting on the ground, or any other position you can think up (keep it clean). This feature comes in handy more than you can expect, and it looks really nice."
1,Unethical seller and bad product,This seller sent us a broken monitor that did not work and never sent us our refund. We googled the problem and reported it to the seller and he said he would send us our refund. We got this for a present 12-10 and as of 3-11 we have not been refunded.
1,F1703 HP Monitor,"The April 2008 review is either an after-the-fact HP plant (or the person is confused).The hp pavilion f1703 (sic) that the people are reviewing here is a monitor; not a computer; and it is indeed awful. After owning a flatscreen from a different vendor (and being impressed with it); I added the HP f1703 in 2005.I was shocked to encounter a: the screen blacking out issue reported by many, and b: the same poor, denying culpability, HP support. After many calls, I *finally* got through to the one :-) HP person that understood.I was able to trade the Brand New f1703 that I had purchased, for a used, refurbished one, from someone else; that included a few (annoyingly placed) dead pixels upon arrival.I recommend hardware to customers.The f1703; dead IPAQs; and a huge 4500n color laser that came dead on arrival has caused me not to recommend HP at all in 4 years. I used to be a big HP proponent, before seeing their quality fall off a lot after 2000."
1,I'm down $500,"Everything started out fine, except, I couldn't quite turn it off. I'd have to unplug it in order for the screen to go dark. So I just left it to the screensaver and paid it no worry.Needless to say, it's burnt out--under a year.HP's customer service took my information (name/email/phone number) and said they'd do some research. This was the most disgusting part of the whole ordeal. I did not hear back from them. I emailed them a second time, and they gave me some tips. One of them worked, and my monitor was on. Problem was, it only worked because the monitor had been inoperative and disconnected for a month and had cooled down a bit.Long story short, I'm over the warranty and they want me to pay in order to fix a problem that came with the monitor. Between this and the other HP products that have broken down on me, I'm never going to buy anything by Hewlett Packard again. Now that I'm five-hundred dollars down with a monitor that'll work for a little while every leap year."
1,Another flake-out after one year,"I was amazed when my monitor started shutting off and looked online to find others had the exact same behavior. The monitor was great until 1 year and 17 days. Talk about planned obsolescene! The warranty and the monitor expire at the same time. Fortunately, I bought the extended service plan at Best Buy, so its their problem for now. But, will it die in 3 months after I get it back again?"
4,Enamel/ leather peace,"Very nice piece. I wounld have prefered a metal chain, but the adjustible leather has been a nice touch. The leather does fit in with the times that I started wearing the peace sign. I wore one through Viet Nam and after. I was looking for an open piece (which I found, in steel), but this is just right in weight and size."
2,to much for this,Ok where to start lets go over the pros and cons of this productpros - it comes with a nic.. err black rope where you can adjust the lengh size of your pendent ....and um nothing else sorry...CONSturns black on you in just 2 weeks off usethe rope will leave a stain on your neck and shirtstoo pricy i saw this item AFTER I bought it at a small thrift shop for 4 bucksthe only shiny thing on this is the fake onixsmells like pure metal and will wear of youAll in all get yourself a sterling sliver one on ebay better prices and better over all material...
4,Beware the stochastic dominance,"Most of the chapters are pretty good for learning how useful internet research is going to be to you and discovering effective techniques to use, but if you're not up on decision theory, skip Mike's own. It is so arcane as to be impenetrable unless this is your field.Generally readable and useful."
5,Good memories,"I ordered this out of a book catlogue when I was 9. The minute I saw Hello Kitty in there, I knew I wanted it. I remember reading this every morning before school started and sharing it with my friend. I'm 18 now and it has brought up good memories :)"
2,1.0 mm flat can't be used to resize watch band. 1.0 mm and 1.4 mm also bent.,"Received on time. I bought this set mainly to size a Seiko watch band. Tried to use the 1.00 mm flat to resize a watch band, but blade too thick to fit into the slot. The 1.0 mm and 1.4 mm flat driver are also not straight, significantly bend. Not used others yet, but the bigger sizes seem to be better but not used yet."
3,ok drivers,This set is not of high quality but will get a few jobs done. I needed this set for minor watch repairs. I tend to use a little more caution when not using quality tools because they tend to get damaged/bent a little bit easier than other tools. will update my review as I get more use out of these tools. Over all was a great price with multiple options in this set. Shipping was fast and arrived intact.
4,TEKTON 2987 Screwdriver Set,The screwdriver set as a whole is great. The tools work as advertized and are well made. The plastic case is however not right. The plastic clasp is not there and the lid just sits there. The box opens every time you move it and the tools spill out. A rubberband fixes the problem but most other kits had a plastic snap closure.
3,"Tools are OK, but set has a number of limitations","The screwdrivers are of good quality. The only issue is that the smaller size screwheads have handles that provide very little torque.The big downside is the case. All that is keeping the 16 piece set in-place is gravity. The smallest bump while opening the case causes the set to fly all over the place. The case is also made of rather cheap clear plastic that I don't think will last.If you are looking to work with really fine screw sizes, I would not buy this set. As mentioned, the screwdrivers are to small to apply enough torque on those very small, but hard to remove screws. It should also be noted that this ""16 piece screwdriver set"" includes 6 hex and nut drives. You are really only getting 10 ""screwdrivers"".As a general set of screwdrives, not a bad set to have in a pinch."
3,Good Variety but not quality,These came with a good variety but the build quality is not too good. The small flat screw driver stripped pretty quickly.. after one use actually...
2,poor quality,"Most of the screwdrivers work, however several did not. The screwdriver part was not connected to the handle... so when you twist the handle, the screwdriver does not turn."
5,A very complete set of precision screwdriver,"It is a very complete set of screwdrivers for all the lit things that you need to repare, like watch bracelets and many electronic devices. i like it and i recommend it"
5,Tekton,"I have no idea why i bought it but definitely will need it in near future. I didnt find anything wrong, yet fir this item. Thanks, have a good day"
1,Saddening...,"I had high hopes for these. I was wrong. The product WAS NOT TEKTON, it was some cheap off brand. They didn't even come in a resealable-case as seen in the picture! I thought, well that's a downer, but not the end of the world, it still has some screwdrivers that look nice. I was wrong. The screwdrivers had bent tips! One was EVEN BROKEN OFF! All I can say is, where is the REAL product I ordered, not some no-name, fake, and cheap screwdrivers. I ordered Tekton, no Chinese crap."
2,"Nice set, but...","The metal isn't as good quality as I'd expected. Worked on 1 project, and already the Phillips head is beginning to strip. Not to mention the strain it put on the palm of my hand as there is no comfort what so ever. Gripping these little buggers is a whole other story. Wasn't pleased at all. Sending back and exchanging for a better product."
4,TEKTON 2987 Precision 16 Piece,"The Tekton 2987 Precision 16 piece screwdriver set is a wonderful product that impressed me from the day i received the delivery, especially with the nut drivers and the added torque support it makes it easier to loosen screws that need a bit more effort than usual. Overall this set should satisfy anyone who looks for something compact but effective."
3,"Disappointed, but Manufacturer is Responsive","Originally posted review 5/28/12: I purchased this set mainly for the small flat screwdrivers, especially the smallest one, to use to fix eyeglasses etc. However, this one, the first one I went to use, was malformed and did not really even have a tip resembling a flathead screwdriver, just sort of a blunt end that was too thick to be a tip.Update 6/18/12: Manufacturer responded 5/29 and offered to arrange for a replacement set. I did not notice that until today and replied to the manufacturer requesting the replacement. Upgraded review from 1 to 3 stars because of this response, and also because the other tools in the set do not appear to be defective. Will update review further pending outcome.."
2,To do better would be an easy fix.,"The tools are OK but the plastic insert makes it impossible to snugly hold each size driver. Hence, they keep popping put and getting all mixed up."
3,Fun.,Too easy to tell it is not a real lighter. Stupid or drunk people might be the only times people will fall for this one.
2,Broke after 6 shocks!,"Order this lighter just to have some fun with, it was fun for about 1/2 an hour. After the 6th person I tried to shock it did not work anymore. I don't know if something inside of it is broken because I can not take it apart to fix it, but I wish it lasted a little longer cause it was getting lots of laughs."
3,fun but cheap gag toy,"This product didn't work at first. We opened it to try replacing the batteries which were advertised as either AA or AAA, but were actually button cell batteries which I did not have on hand...so we tried reversing the batteries and it worked. It also was not so easy to open. But once we got it working it is a fun cheap gag item."
4,Fun,"Fun lighter, see how long can you hold it for, everyone knows it shocks < ok everyone I know >It needs a little more weight, but I think of it as a gag.Seller was prompt in delivery, helpful upon contact."
4,Good,"Good gag, Shock is pretty intense as far as shocking products go. Also ""more"" durable thhen most shocking products as well."
2,Garbage,Shockingly awful quality. Very thin and delicate. In no way does it feel or look like a lighter. Not fun.
3,Verrrry Amusing,The first couple of times shocked verywell. Left you in a daze. friends kept dropping it one they got shocked lasted me a day works now and then. But well worth the three bucks if its an add on
5,Prepare to really piss people off,"My wife bought this shocker and I can't believe the horse power it delivers. Nor can I believe that it's still working after being dropped or thrown at least 30 times. When you want to pull the gag on someone make sure you are ready for them to take a swing at you.I would not recommend ""this kind of fun"" in an environment where booze is setting the mood. Unless your kind of fun is watching someone else getting their arse kicked."
5,SHOCKING Cigarette Lighter,"My son has smoked for quite awhile now. Over the years, he had shown me his various lighters. I saw these and wanted to personally give them to him and watch the fun begin. Unfortunately, I missed his shocking experience, but I gave him many days of shocking fun with his friends. Remember to purchase more than one lighter. I purchased two lighters for him. I knew it would happen sooner or later. One of his buddies would borrow the lighter so he could shock his friends...and forget to return it Sean.While at a party, place the lighter beside the ashtray and watch the fun begin.I also keep a shocking flashlight and shock pens that write, nearby to jump start my friends."
3,worked great.... at first.,"Got maybe 1 day and three pranks before began malfunctioning but what can you expect for the price. It also feels a bit to fake and hard to fool someone unless they are already a bit drunk. So overall, its o.k.for the cost if you order it together with other items."
1,Avoid this product.,"When I first got them, I thought that maybe my minidisc player was defective. Now, I know better. Don't buy this, unless you want to throw away your money."
4,A little surprising,"My roommate picked this CD up before I had heard anything by them. It was pretty decent but nothing stood out. Then he put it on in the car the other day, and I was captivated.Now some of these songs just have too many ""I'm sad and it's the 80's"" sounds to them. Their single, for instance, makes me cringe sometimes. But there are amazingly wonderful gems on this disc. ""CTWYL"", or ""Chante The Way You Live"", starts out with a string sound that grips my throat and heart and forces me to listen. The lyrics are stunning, and then I think to myself, ""Perhaps this band deserves more credit?""That's what you'll be thinking too, the moment Pitty Sing enters your life."
4,A must see,"This movie is beautiful. It is a smart storyline that HASN'T been done before. It is creative and the cinematography is great! I watch this movie over and over again.(I know it's rated R, but the swearing did get kind of ridiculous. If it weren't for the swearing I would share this movie with everyone!)"
3,Large readable numbers for time and date.,"I bought this clock for my husband who has trouble seeing a normal size clock and with keeping track of what date it is. It works well for that. My only complaint is that the piece meant for a stand on the back of the clock (if you don't want to hang it) is very flimsy and broke within a week. Also, the numbers on the date are a little close together, making it a little more difficult to read. Overall a good buy."
4,Son Tom,"Much the same as other reviews related to a need for a larger clock that tells the date and day for my 94 year old mother.It works fine on a wall or stand. Wish it had a back light. Found out the ""S"" appears to look like a ""5"" Sunday when Mom called to find out the day. I asked what the clock said and she said ""5 U N"". Guess learning never ends.The clock is worth the money for the size and information it provides."
4,Atomic Clock.,"I like the clock, however, I wish it had a backgroung light so that I could see it in the dark."
2,Junk,"Purchased this a few months ago as I replacement for my bedside alarm clock. Was very disappointed. Mechanically the product is flawed. It took two days for it to properly sync to the right atomic time. Additionally, the lack of a back light makes this item almost impossible to see in low light situations. Worst of all, the paint scratched so easily, I had to get rid of the clock in a couple of weeks."
4,"GOOD CLOCK, JUST NEED BACKLIGHT",BOUGHT FOR MOM SO SHE COULD REMINDER THE DAY. WORKS GOOD FOR HER. IT JUST NEEDS A BACKLIGHT.LIKE THAT IT IS ATOMIC NO HAVING TO SET IT. VERY EASY TO USE.
2,Atomic Clock with Day and Date,"I bought this clock for my elderly mother who has dementia and macular degeneration. Unfortunately in her case this clock is not helping her. I have it mounted right next to her recliner and she should be able to read it but can't. Its not back lite so you can't see it at night and its difficult to read in a room not well lite (because of her macular degeneration). After 2 1/2 weeks of use the clock was not tracking with the date and day, it actually took itself back to the year 2000 (and this is 2011). I reset the year and date/day information and I'm waiting to see if it holds this time. I don't know what other alternatives I have to help my aging mother know the time and date, wish this would have worked for her."
5,Great for elderly with dementia,"I purchased this for my mother who has dementia and never can remember the day of the week. I had one other clock similar to this (my mother lost it), but I like this one so much better because it's far easier to set up. The last one didn't convert when daylight savings time automatically for some reason - this one did. Plus since she tends to mess with buttons, she changes the display accidentally - this one I can just figure out - I don't need a book to fix it. My only complaint is that it doesn't light up."
2,Had to return,"I had high hopes for this clock but it did not work correctly, It did not set correctly and would not change from one day to the next. Gave it a few days with no success and returned it, that process went well Amazon is great, Atomic Clock not so much, Sorry"
3,Atomic Clock,"Purchased this clock for my 93-yr-old mom, who constantly asks ""What day is it again?""...Was encouraged to purchase due to the one favorable review that was published.My findings: the initial set-up of the clock was too complicated.I had to enlist the aid of my husband to figure it out.Like the fact that the clock is light-weight,slim,and easily transportable to any location by my mom.....Now if only we can get her accustomed to USING it to remind her of the day of the week!."
4,Good Clock for Elderly,"Because my mom has dementia and finds it confusing to know the day of the week, this clock has been a great help to her. Since it displays the time, date, and day of week all on an easy to read clock front, it is a wonderful tool. The only problem I have found is getting the time zone set properly. In the fall when the time changed, we had problem with the clock. Since the instructions had been misplaced, I was able to find the instructions online and fix the problem we were having. That was the only drawback for us. Otherwise, I am pleased to have this as a great tool for my mom."
3,atomic!!!,did not set itself as advertised! still I do like the size of the numbers because of these old eyes.
1,could not get it to work right!,"do not purchase this, it looks good but very difficult to set and it does not stay set right. thanks to other reviewers for their feedback on items."
3,Psychiatric Home Care,"I had hoped for a more user-friendly layout. There is good information in this book, however; I was hoping for more of a quick reference guide."
1,Worked for a short while...The DVD that is.,"I'm sure by now the company knows they have a huge problem with the lasting quality of the DVDS. After only 10 plays my DVD will not play in any DVD player. I searched the web and it appears to happen very often. Now get this, you would think the company would stand behind their product? Not so! They only have a 90 day guarantee. So they are saying that after, lets say 45 times or less watching it, and it breaks, you are screwed. And it's not like there are many DVDs out there that will guide you through using the pilates machine, and if there is, please let me know.It's really a shame that people that buy this machine research the machine itself and low and behold the DVD damage can actually prohibit any successful progress with it.Stamina company, DVDs are cheap to you, how about letting people send them back at any given time if they break and you send them another one, it's just good customer service."
1,Caution,"The book is in ""loose leaf notebook form"". Be sure you have all the pages. My copy was missing more than just a few."
2,It's okay.,"I guess I am more of a picture person. There are no pictures in this book. It feels more like an encyclopedia for drinks/shots. I've had this book for more than 5 years now and I have used it a couple times. So, it was possibly worth the money spent. It seems like most of the drink recipes in this book are old fashioned. I did like the intro portion of how to set up your bar. However, I've seen better drink books."
1,Old,"I bought it from a brand new category, but the book had definitely been used before. Was not satisfied with the purchase since I intended it to be a gift and wanted a new one."
2,"Comprehensive, but hard to use","This book has a TON of drinks, but there are no color photos and the drinks are arranged by the name of the drink, not the type of alcohol or main ingredients. Plus, as a paperback, you have to hold it open to use it- not very handy. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
2,Not so good,This didn't help me what so ever. I already knew what was in it... It doesn't contain any newer drinks.
2,ok,I was not impresed with this book. While everything is sorted it is still kind of piled together(small print and crapping newprint paper with no space between anything). I looked up some of my favorite and the recipes were messed up.
1,Beware of what's popular!,"The only thing this bartender's guide has going for it is its hard, oversized cover. Otherwise its only conceivable use is to feed a waning fire. I have been a bartender for over seven years, and I have read a dozen or so reference books. The Bartenders Bible is my least favorite of all. Its organizational system is ponderous and ultimately useless to a bartender in a pinch. It is polluted with obscurely named concoctions that make an experienced bartender wonder if the editors didn't just make them up to fill space. On top of that it is sloppy. If anyone can tell the difference between the ""cosmos"" pg96 and a daiquiri pg97, be my guest.I don't know what Mr. Regan was thinking with this book? I have also read his ""New Classic Cocktails"" and found it to be a much better read. Whatever the cause, beware of this book. Just because it called a ""Bible"" doesn't mean it's a Good Book."
4,best bartending guide available,"Pretty much I agree with Brian Tomkiel's review. Complaints about looking things up confuse me, since there is an alphabetical index. There are drinks missing. But every single bartending guide I've looked at is missing one drink or another. In practice, I've never had problems with this book. Besides, most people who are asking for ""popular"" drinks like the Cosmopolitan and Hurricane know how they're made...it doesn't kill you to ask someone rather than looking in the book.In the end, sure, maybe it's not perfect for bar use. Then again, I don't see the negative reviews suggesting what IS perfect for professional bar use. For home bar use, however, this book is the best of the many I have and have used."
1,Frustratingly unusable,"As a manager of a liquor store, I am always asked how to make various drinks. Bartenders Bible is the only guide supplied by our buyer, which is unfortunate. It is cumbersome to use as it is organized, even in the index, by type of alcohol used in the drink. Most people are asking what type of alcohol (vodka, rum, etc.) goes into such and such drink, so how can they efficiently look it up by this method? Also, the book seldom has the drinks people are looking for, but is loaded with obscure mixtures that no one has heard of or cares about. This is a very user-unfriendly book."
5,Wonderful resource...,"I have used this book at several parties and have loved it - the section on what you need to set up a home bar was great - with not just the liquor, but also the equipment and glassware - with pictures, to boot! This was my first wet bar, and this book has been great so far..."
1,you dont need to buy this book,you dont need a bartenders bible i bought it thinking it would help me with bar tending i will most likely sale it
2,"Okay as a reference, but missing some popular drinks.","Has some interesting info about the history, processes of distilling, etc., about alcohol. It is a fairly comprehensive guide, however, I don't think it is a ""bible"" of drinks. It is missing some ""modern classics"" such as the Cosmopolitan. Also, I only found one recipe for mulled or hot spiced wine. (One of my cookbooks has about 8 variations on this). This book may be good as a starter guide, or supplement to others, but it does not cover everything. Also, it would be nice to have some photographs for those of us who are ""home"" bartenders and could use some more visual information about presentation. (There are some black ink sketchs of glass styles, equipment, but that's about it). The hardback version, though, does have a handy ""flippable"" binding style. My final score - acceptable, but not the best."
3,"Good book, but not the latest drinks included.","THIS BOOK IS GREAT FOR THE BEGINNER...NOT FOR THE SEMI PROFESSIONAL BARTENDER, OR PROFESSIONAL, NOR FOR THE EXPERIENCED HOME BARTENDER. MOST BOOKS HAVE MORE DRINKS TO OFFER, WITH BOOKS LIKE THE BARTENDERS BLACK BOOK WHICH IS MORE USER FRIENDLY AND HAS MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY RECIPES I WOULD RATHER SPEND THE DIFFERENCE."
5,A Valued Purchase,The technical quality of the performance is excellent. Some of the phrasing is innovative but consistant with Haydn's composition. The album is well worth purchasing and listening to many times.
1,Most difficult book ever,"I am a college student and consider myself to be of respectable intelligence. However, is most definitely the most incomprehensible book that I have ever read. Keep away."
1,Horrible,"I had to buy this book for school, Its so boring and horrible. I hate it. Repetitive and just bad. I hope teachers stay away from it. I wish I could give it less than one star."
3,Love the hat-size is misleading...,"This hat is well made and sooooo cute! We were hoping our baby could wear it by the end of the year, but this looks more like a toddler size, not for an infant...maybe a two-three year old? We'll just store it in his room as a decoration till he's big enough to wear it =)"
4,Nice hat for infants only.,"I received this hat, actually two of them when my son was born. It was a very good fit until about 13 months (49 cm head circumference) when it started to leave marks on his forehead. It is very cute and I recommend this cap, just don't expect it to last him 3 years like the description states."
1,Outdated,"This may be the Second edition of the book, but too many of the so called sports and games are outdated or totally impractical for school use."
4,Son loves this!,"My son got this for his first birthday - a year later he still plays with this EVERY day. It is his favorite toy by far. Yes, the dumper in the front occasionally comes off but it is easy to put back on."
2,Won't buy this again,Bought this for my daughter's birthday slumber party. The blue only seems to show up in light colored hair. Brunettes don't even look like they have any in their hair. Easy to wash off surfaces and skin and out of hair.
5,Dollar Store Luckliness,"I found Samsung blank CD-Rs at a local dollar store. I thought, what the heck. I only bought 2 CD-Rs. I used the first one on a music mix of 20 songs. Wow, at 52x these are awesome! The burn very fast, and are not faulty.The music was very good sounding. One problem is that it did scratch easily, but that's okay because I own a CD-Case to keep my CDs safe from damage.These CD-Rs were so good, I bought the 10-Pack. Still no faulty ones, besides the first one at the dollar store. If you need just a couple 10 more CD-Rs, this will do very well."
1,THESE ARE NOT SAMSUNG CD-R THEY ARE TDK,THESE MUST BE SOME KIND OF MISTAKE EITHER MISLABLED OR AMAZON SENT ME THE WRONG CD-RS I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING THESE SAMSUBNG CD-RS IN FACT I ORDER 2 BECAUSE I LOVE SAMSUNG CD-R'S AND SAMSUNG PRODUCTS. SO I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED WHEN I RECIEVED MY ORDER.IT WAS BAD ENOUGH THAT I DIDNT GET MY SAMSUNG CD-R'S I GOT THE MOST CD-R'S I DONT LIKE FROM TDK THEY ARE CHEAPLY MADE AND DONT SOUND TO GOOD. BUT AMAZON DID MAKE IT RIGHT THEY GAVE ME A 100% REFUND AND I DIDNT HAVE TO RETURN THE DISC MY MAIN REASON POSTING THIS IS BE CAREFUL THESE MY BE NOT SAMSUNG CD-R'S
1,Try the local library first,"I went to the library first after reading the mixed reviews. I'm glad I did not invest any money. I found the book somewhat difficult to understand. I have no idea when I am supposed to use the Vodka and cayenne tonic. The book doesn't say to leave it in or rinse it out. Was I supposed to apply in the morning or after a shampoo? I read the book three times and found a lot of it confusing. The recipes I was able to make but took most of a day making a shampoo, rinse and tonic.Oddly enough after using her regimen my hair started falling out. I had beautiful hair before I began! I was just looking for a healthy shampoo. Before you buy this book go to your library and decide for yourself if you should own it."
2,General Help only,This book focuses on removing residues that may be impacting your hair's growth. Much of it focuses on VERY involved processes and ingredients for creating home-made hair care products. Expect to spend many hours a week preparing the concoctions. It may help for general hair loss.I am a 31-yr-old female experiencing androgenic alopecia and was disappointed to find no reference to treating the hormonal causes of this problem.
3,ok advice,"i had never heard of riquette hofstein , but thought i would check out the book. i noticed that her shampoos use a base of castille soap. i went to the healthfood store and bought an already mixed liquid soap for under 10 bucks containing hemp oil , jojoba, vitamin e, and peppermint oil. ( made by a certain "" doctor "" whose last name starts with b and ends with r ) i saved myself alot of time and money by doing this. i feel it's almost impossible to follow every step in this book. i've just been using a daily vitamin b complex, cayenne pepper for scalp stimulation, and dr. b all in one magic soap. total cost about 16 bucks. and yes my hair/scalp has improved. as for the book, its so so."
1,impossible,"While reading this book and the author's recipes for your hair to grow seem impossible. The amount of oils being used day, night, weekly and monthly. Don't waste your time or money on this book. Most of these reciped just grossed me out and can do more harm than good on your hair. Do you really want to put cayenne pepper and vodka in your hair everyday and then go to work that way? I don't think so."
2,Fine job on the basics,"Rubell's book makes a great gift for people setting up their first kitchen. It explains the basic recipes for solid cooking that most Americans expect people to know. Real Life Entertaining also offers a decent collection of good hints for new cooks as well.Experienced cooks will find this book offers few novel recipes, many photographs that don't give solid presentation suggestions, and lots of white space. These features make the book less overwhelming to novices, but strip it of value for those seeking to expand a good repertoire.I rate cookbooks by the number of interesting recipes offered. This ranking system probably does not reflect the market Rubell's book is targeted at."
3,Disappointed - not enough recipe variety,"This book was highly recommended by 2 food blog friends who gush about it as their entertaining Bible. I was disappointed in it because many of the recipes seem to be very similar from page to page. The book itself looks nice - pretty photos, nice layout. But there's not much substance or excitement to the too simple recipes. I wouldn't make any of these for company as they are too basic and not anything memorable. I like my copy of the cookbook from Elizabeth's on 37th St., of Savannah for her more company type recipes. I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money on this book."
4,Good product,This product was as described and fit my wreath great. I believe it will protect it in our storage shed from critters and weather as well.
3,This book was okay,"I was a little dissapointed with the amount of content in this book. What content it did have was helpful and well described, but I expected a few different projects. I found the metal jewelry making tips helpful."
2,"This is just the book, not a kit","""All the skills and tools you need to get started"" implied to me that this would come with some tools. If that's what you're expecting too, be aware that you get only the book. (This expectation was exacerbated by the fact that this product came up on an Amazon search for keyword ""beading kit"".) That being said, it is a good, well-illustrated book. I bought it as a gift for a beginner though and expected it to have some beginner tools along with it, but it just TELLS you which tools you should buy. I think the title is somewhat misleading."
2,GENESIS-SUCKS,"I ordered ten piece.Payed for ten piece.I got 4 and a receipt of ten.I made a complaint!They said they were out of the stock-but the receipt did not mention I was sent less than I ordered.I got a refund of the 6 pieces, but not of the shipping cost that was much higher than the cost on the parcel.Do You think I am satisfied?Would You be ?"
4,A Great Voice!,"This is my first Aaron Neville CD and it does not disappoint at all--a lovely instrument he has with his voice--an American original. I saw him live at The Birchmere theatre in Northern Virginia not too long ago and his voice was almost drowned out by his accompyment, however, you hear his wonderful voice so clearly on the CD--I highly recommend it to fans."
5,The Best of Aaron Neville,It's always a pleasure to hear that wonderful voice of Aaron Neville.No one else can put such emotion in a song. This was a great purchase.
3,A little disappointed,"I love Aaron Neville, however, I was a little disappointed with this CD because it didn't seem to be as highly stylized as his other works. Mr. Neville has a beautiful voice and he could sing the phone directory and I would enjoy it, it just seemed as though someone had taken something truly amazing and removed just enough of the soul to make it a little less amazing."
2,Everybody Plays The Fool...But you don't have to be one!,"Such a disappointment. I purchased this CD with the expectation that Track #4 ""Don't Take Away My Heaven,"" would be the single/radio airplay version that was released in 1992 instead of the original CD version that appears on his album. I specifically bought this CD in hopes of having the radio mix...but alas, as Aaron sings, ""Everybody plays the fool,"" and boy was I the fool this time...so be weary that the non-radio/single remix of ""Don't Take Away My Heaven"" appears on this disappointing CD. Unhappy in New Orleans :("
5,Incredibly gifted Neville,"This cd seems to contain a variety of genre of songs to illustrate on one cd exactly the range of Aaron Neville. He can go from gospel, to jazz, to rock, to country and then some and convince the listener he was raised in whatever style he sings. That ability gives testimony to his incredible talent and gift. This cd is a keeper."
2,1 out of two ain't bad,camera fine: viewfinder (rare in low cost point and shoots) software and ease of use are all plussesprinter bad: colors and clarity good. photo comes out of printer scratched and bentreturning both to start over fresh.
5,Excellent Deal,What a great deal this is!!!! I love the convienence of printing my own pictures when I want to. This was a gift for my 23 year old daughter. This camera has been to Disney World and alot of other places. It is great for people who do not have alot of money to tie up in electronics. It is a basic camera that takes great pictures. I was very pleased when my shipment showed up on time I think it was even a little early. So far so good no problems. I would recommend this product to anyone.
3,Easy Share 533,"The camera and software are easy to use as the name says. Those who struggle with using software should not have and problems getting around. I have had the camera for about a year and it has survived rather rough treatment from my teen daughter including a trip to India and back. My main complaint is the camera requires a heavy duty lithium ion battery. It is not sold with one and should be. Alkaline batteries if they work at all, are quickly consumed. The rechargeable CR-V3 Li-ion fits this camera. The battery I purchased has 1800 mAmp hours. The charger with a 110vac plug plus a car adapter and 2 batteries can be purchased online for $20."
1,printer doesn't work,"The camera is great, but the printer didn't work, which was a huge disappointment. It was a Christmas gift for my husband. I contacted the company that sold it to me through Amazon, but all I got was a generic ""how to return merchandise"" email. No follow-up. I ended up buying a different printer at Target later on. This is the first time I have had such an experience at Amazon, so I have to say that I was very surprised and disappointed."
1,Kodak printer Dock Series 3,It is by far the sorriest piece of junk bearing Kodaks Trademark that I have ever seen or had the misfortune to purchase and try to use. The one year warranty was allowed to expire while I was trying to get some help from their Tech.Support. It will not feed the paper it tries but that's it. I fought this for two months. Kodak says they will repair it for $80 plus shipping. So far the little camera that came with it has performed well
3,text,"Informative on the issue but rather stiffly written, too structural in presentation as if form matters more than substance."
2,"Useful, but Limited","As an American, I found this guide to be disorganized and spotty. Each of the climbs IS well described, but there is no overview of the different areas, no large scale maps, or even an index. Maybe if you already know your way around the alps, this is adequate, but if you want to actually find out where in Switzerland the climb actually is, you'll be consulting other maps and guides.Also, the use of the older rating system, with no real conversion, is disconcerting. How hard actually IS a 'peu difficile' climb? The translation is 'a little difficult', but for who?Overall, the guide has good information on the climbs, but I found I had to supplement it with a hiking guide to orient me to the alps as a whole."
5,Great guidebook for travelers and scholars.,"Richardson covers all the basics in just a few pages. Most of the book is devoted to specs on about 55 crosses throughout Ireland and photos from several different angles, which is a particular detail she attends to. She also includes information on similar Georgian and Armenian crosses, which seem to be related. Richardson has done extensive research in the area of high crosses, and studied with the likes of Nora Chadwick and Francoise Henry. This is a great intro (but only an intro) and the paperback would be a wonderful guidebook to take with you on Cross Hikes in Ireland."
2,"Old school RPG, indeed","This game is a grind-fest with practically zero story. I felt like I was playing a primitive RPG. I will admit it is one of few RPGs I have played that is truly challenging.I am not sure why this is on the DS. Besides the draw your own map idea the game makes no use of its power. There is almost no animation. You never see your characters except in a portrait in menus. Battle is represented by an enemy portrait being assaulted by a flash and either a yellow slash or maybe a lightning bolt. The rest of the game is done by exploring a 3D maze first-person style sometimes avoiding a glowing ball that represents a tougher enemy or navigating menus in town.If you like true old school gaming on the go this game is for you. If you want a more evolved game with more substance, I don't recommend this one."
4,Great old-school dungeon crawler,"I spent many days during my misspent youth playing the original Wizardry RPG on my Apple II, making little paper maps to mark my way through the dungeon.Etrian Odyssey captures that old-school feeling, complete with annotating your own map as you traverse the labyrinth. I never thought that I'd ever again have the patience to draw my own map in a dungeon crawler, but Etrian Odyssey makes it fun (it does most of the grunt work for you, leaving you to just fill in a few details here and there)."
4,"Etrian Odyssey, aka Yggdrasil Labyrinth","Formerly known as Yggdrasil Labyrinth, Etrian Odyssey is a very challenging, completely turn-based RPG. Think of it as an old-school RPG, but stripped down to its elements. There is very little story and your party characters have no distinguishing features except for their job class and character portrait, which you pick from 4 possible designs. Don't expect interesting environments--there are 5 different environments, which change every five floors you go through the dungeon. They're 3-D and quite pretty for a DS game, but extremely repetitive. They're really just a background.It's worth mentioning that although the game is ridiculously hard on the first floor, it gradually gets easier as you progress, although it's never as easy as most modern RPGs.If, like me, you thought Final Fantasy III (the best RPG available on the DS currently) was fairly easy, then you should be able to enjoy Etrian Odyssey despite its difficulty."
5,First EO,I really do like the game. It is slow and I think it will be my forever game. I am an adult and can't play non-stop. But I like it enough to keep on working on my levels.
5,A fine and a fun book,"This novel is extremely well made and fun to read. The settingis beautiful and exotic (to me, at least), the characters arevery finely drawn and memorable, the plot keeps you guessing.The famous literary figures and their foibles and highlyinteresting comments on writing are alone worth the price ofadmission. The dialogue, as in the party scenes, iswonderful -- accents are perfect, characters are immediatelyrecognizable, pacing is exciting, humor is in full floweryet it comes with real insights into the lives of thecharacters and their worlds. In sum, I loved it."
1,Misrepresented!,"I recieved this, and cannot even lift it! I want ALL of my money, including shipping costs back! It is not 19 lbs, as stated, it is more like 50! Complete false advertising! Company says Amazon is to blame for misrepresentation!!"
3,"Skechers Infant/Toddlers' Antics Sneakers,Light Pink/White","Runs very small. VERY narrow. Seems like a very good quality shoe, but my daughter who was wearing a 4 at the time, the size 5 that i ordered her didn't even come close to fitting her. Runs very small."
5,The title is correct,"The word for securities is bursatiles and the word for insurance is seguros. Despite the comments of another reviewer, the title of our book is correct. In fact, if one would look at our dictionary series they would know that we have both and insurance and securities dictionary. Thank you."
4,Good summary,"I read this to help me with my professional career in valuation of closely-held businesses. For those who want to understand a great deal more about the equity risk premium, it is a really helpful work.One problem -- The index is pathetic."
3,"Detailed research, not targeted to a typical investor","The book seems to be targeted towards University researcher types more than people interested in learning about investing. If you are looking for a book that helps to explain how to value individual stocks for investment, skip this book.There is a lot of detailed analysis of past history or stock market performance and other fundamentals. There is a comparison of dividend trends and lots of other stuff. Almost all of the book treats the entire market as a whole rather than analyzing individual stocks. I believe the conclusion of the book is that the stock market as a whole is over priced based on the extensive research performed by the author."
2,Still don't understand the ERP puzzle,"The real dillema regarding ERP is that the real ex-post ERP is irrationally different from the the ex-ante ERP required for CAPM valuations. Prof. Cornell does explore this issue well for a general audience. However, this book does not diminish my skepticism of CAPM equilibrium valuations and ex-ante ERP estimators."
3,Bright...at first.,"I really liked this spotlight when I opened the package- the light was sufficiently bright and I liked the design of the whole thing because I could prop it up. Plus of course, the ability to recharge it (via standard ac outlet and throught the car) was very nice! But then the light weakened after about 15 minutes. I had bought the light for power outages, which usually last at least a couple of hours here when it happens, and this just won't do it. It would be okay for other purposes, but if you are looking for something that will last at least an hour or more, this won't be the light for you."
5,OE Rocks,Only Everything is an awesome band. Their recording was great. I am looking forward to hearing more of their stuff hopefully some time in the near future. I highly recomend their recording to everyone I know.
2,"No good for exercising, Fine for sitting.",I bought this to play MP3s while walking / exercising. It is unusable for that purpose. It skips very often (like every minute) when in motion and when it starts to skip I have to stand still for a few seconds for it continue. Perhaps my unit is defective. It was cheap and is usable for sitting in one place so I won't bother returning it but I do have to buy a new portable MP3 player to walk around with. I'll probably find an ac adapter for this and leave it at work. For the price if it gets stolen it's no big deal.I think the controls (buttons) are very well designed and the price was the lowest I found.
2,Rio Volt SP60,"After ordering a Rio Volt SP60 MP3/CD player, I found it could not play MP3 CD's. I was sent another unit and it too would not play MP3. The MP3 CD was burned on a PC and plays on other MP3 compatible players (i.e SP50).I believe since the software in the SP60 is Version 1.0, it's possible there are still some format issues yet to solve. The RioVolt company could not assist in any way, so the unit was returned."
2,Skip to m'Lou,"I bought this player because I wanted to start doing the mp3 thing and thought that, given the price this would be a good place to start. If the implementation of my plan called for something better, I thought, I could upgrade down the line. I have to say in all honesty that I never loaded a single mp3 into it, because I found it's standard cd playback so lacking. The measure of a good cd player is that it can still play an old or fair-condition cd well. Not this player! The slightest imperfection and it was skipping or out of business altogether. Also, It was very sensitive to shock which annoyed even my daughter when I tried to fob it off on her. It eats batteries like a fiend in anti-skip mode. I gave it two stars because of it's neat features: a line out in addition to headphones out, a backlit lcd. Still, it's nothing if it doesn't do what it's supposed to. I'd look elsewhere if I were you."
1,Rip-Off!!!,"The British Beat LiveI was looking for original 1960s video of bands, when I found the listing for this DVD. Nowhere does it state what this DVD contains... just the opposite! It leads people to think it has video of the stars in their younger days. Shocking... The DVD cover doesn't give a hint. As soon as you put the DVD in the player and it boots to the menu, then you get it. Watch out for others if you are looking for original video of bands... not old farts."
4,The British Beat Live Review,"Good I ordered this music video. The artists are great, too bad the video is too short. The sound is very good. Brings back memories of the past."
1,Not What I Expected,"My fault for not reading the reviews from previous owners. When I saw thepicture on the DVD I assumed it would be The Groups/Singers performing LIVE in the 1960's, NOT! Don't let the picture fool you. It is not even the original group (at times just a member) singing a 2007 version of thesong. Yes, It's Live but the magic of their youth is missing. I'm sorry, but I have to agree with Grace Slick when she refers to the perfomers who are still milking the success they produced in the sixties- Cmon people,Time to give it up. Keep the integrity of the orginal song(s)and theexitement of the original sound at the time they were first heard-because that was MAGICAL."
3,Too much doctoring..,"Okay T J Lubinsky, I think you've had enough for a while. Why don't you slow down and do this right. You've got the right string, but the wrong yo-yo. Here a few critiques. Too much audience track. What happened? Did Eric Burdon sound like garbage when you cut to the vintage footage from Hullabaloo? Nowhere on stage did Peter and Gordon have an acoustic 12 string guitar, yet one cuts through the entire song. How much over-dubbing do you do? I know you bring in singers to fix the bad vocals. I know some people who have done it for you. Your hearts in the right place, but you're pumping these things out like there's no tomorrow and they suck. Try bringing some true quality to the projects and please!!!! Quit pimping PBS with every act.."
4,dazzling,"I am glad to see the term ""picaresque"" applied to this novel, for it truly belongs within that genre. But while the story bounds along, at times verging on the highly improbable, the language dazzles on every page - in every paragraph, in fact. The author, to whom English was (I imagine) a 2nd or 3rd language, shares with Joseph Conrad (and not a few other non-native English speakers) an enviable mastery of the most subtle wit, the choicest use of epithets, the snappiest of similes. And, having spent a bit of time in Tbilisi, Georgia, in the past decade, I thought more than once or twice in the course of my reading how well that valley city, with its river, smog - and wall-to-wall gangsters - could have served as the setting of this unlikely but likeable tale..."
4,An Admirable Debut,"What you'll like:- The humor- in the descriptions, character development and plot points- The author's an equal opportunist; he pokes fun at different nationalities, socioeconomic classes, political parties and personalities- The story is extremely well thought out; it takes a talented author to make you feel as if the main character has no idea where he's going or what he's doing when he knows exactly- The chase scenes- two comical ones involving taxis- The women- young, political and in controlWhat you may not like:- At times you may ask yourself if Gary Shteyngart could have condensed the novel a bit, shaved off a few pages here or there- If you crave rationality and stability Vladimir, the main character, may frequently irk you- Do people really care about shoe statues that much??Obviously, I had to grasp for negatives. Give it a try!"
4,"interesting style of prose, interesting take on human agenda","i started reading this book as a bored exploration of fiction, but was quickly absorbed into the basic underdog plot. man is at the bottom with no where to go but up...call to adventure a crazy old russian war hero...i've known many russians over my time and while not all russians act and talk alike, i found this book to be very reminding of some their mannerisms and their priorities. while not altogether solid, this book is definitely worth a try, if you like reading about the underdog."
2,Not worth the time,"This novel has so much promise at the beginning, with Vladimir's adventures through Manhattan. At first, the story moves quickly and is extremely funny. When the hero goes overseas, it just turns awful. It becomes painful to read. The plot is absurd, the characters (who are hard to keep track of) are pathetic. Shteyngart should've kept the entire story in NYC. He definitely has a lot of talent, but he needs more discipline."
2,I couldn't finish,"I tried. Yes, this has some wonderful comic aspects. Sometimes you laugh outloud. But, it's a push. I think it would be a fun book to pick up and read a few pages once in a while. No need to follow the story. Is there one? But you can laugh. Especially if you've had any experience with the lives of recent immigrants. Just too long for me though."
4,"Choppy, original, and, hilarious.",Choppy and broken plot line reads like broken English (as intended). Hilarity ensues on every page. Page-turner start to finish. Russian debutantes never make appearance.
5,Hooray for the sausage weilding pensioners,"Truly one of the most hilarious books I have ever read! Anyone who has spent time in Eastern Europe will appreciate the Soviet/Post-Soviet era spoofs and will find this book more relevantly humorous than those who haven't visited Russia, although I don't think those lacking first-hand experience with Soviet culture will be disappointed. The faux Leninist speech Vladimir gives to the sausage weilding pensioners tops my list as one of the funniest scenes I have read. Shteyngart's excessive verbosity colors the text with a witty, dry and exaggerated humor that kept me hooked on the book and laughing all the way. I'm looking forward to his next venture."
2,Scripted for TV,"After the first sixty pages, the characters in this book, particularly its hero, degenerate. By the chapters about ""searching for money"" I am completely detached from the plot. This book has been described as ""picaresque""--I describe it as pandering in well-worn style of sitcoms. The ending in particular pulls a stunt seen far too many times already--it's as if the author, under pressure to finish the already contracted book, forgot his original vision and went for a scripted-for-tv-ending."
2,nabokov-smabokov,"Another russploitation piece, comfortably confirming for an average American the age-old stereotypes about ""those crazy Russians."" Good bathroom reading though! My advice - wait for the paperback."
4,"Different, but not hilarious","Shtenyngart follows a young man from New York to ""Prava,"" an invented city in Eastern Europe. Our hero is not particularly moral, and gets into many interesting adventures as a result. Masquerading as a highschooler leads him to flee the country and begin a new life of pyramid schemes among a kind of Russian mafia. The book is wonderful because it is different and wholly original. It is a story that has not been told before, and I enjoyed it as such.However, the book advertises itself to be hilarious, and I rarely found myself laughing and only occasionally smiling. I was amused, but quietly. For me, the book was funny at times but hardly the height of comedy."
3,Criminal Brutality - - is Cute,"Jewish vaudiville farce makes light of ""naughty"" post-Soviet pillaging of Eastern Europe by amoral Jews supported by ex-KGB hoodlums, finding no serious fault with all things antisocial in Western society. Contains a minor theme of natural abuse of naive women, and maximum references to the giants of Slavic literature, such as Tolstoy, Lermontov, and Milan Kundera, apparently hoping their stature will enhance the image of this wannabe clown. Despite the reprehensible content, the quality of the writing is quite good, and a few of the contrived ""funny"" events pasted together in this novel actually ARE funny. Still, on the whole, there are tons of better ways to waste one's time than reading such nonsense."
5,shteyngart is a natural comedian,"I have had a similar upbringing as the author. I came to New York when I was young from Russia, and had a similar kind of education and I have to say the author gets the whole thing down right. Not only is he a great writer he has the kind of comic timing that only a good comedian has. The jokes come fast and furious and you just speed through the novel on the humor alone. Not everyone can get this comedy I'm sure but for those who have an open mind this is a trip worth taking (see for example the funny false naturalization ceremony for immigrants, the bonfire of Soviet clothes, etc.) This is the beginning of a great talent worth watching. The last few pages are an intersting way to finish the book because they show us just how sad the hero's story is beneath the laughter."
4,"Clever, witty, and right on","I too was among the thousands who in the late 70's/early 80's immigrated as kids and preteens to the US from various republics of the then-Soviet Union. So in reading Shteyngart's debut, so much struck close to home - from the suburban-bound parents, to the bizarre home remedies (""cupping,"" mustard compresses), to Soviet kindergartens, to the delicious Russian candy (now faithfully replicated in Brooklyn and adored by my daughters and American friends). So, yes, many of us might have had the content to write this book about the crazy-yet-ordinary adventures of the lovable Vladimir Girshkin, but definitely not the gorgeous command of the language (that's where the Nabokov comparison is right on) and the clever, satirical eye. And, yes, there are some flaws with this first novel, but lack of wit and talent are certainly not among them. I can't wait to see what my zemlyak (fellow countryman) will produce next."
1,Writer should write more than pretty sentences,"The author clearly has a talent with language, there are many cleverly written passages in the book - and these are sometimes quite amusing. I wanted to like this book, but am putting it down at about 275 pages into it. The main character gives me no reason to care what he will do next. The catalog of characters are caricature comments on cultural (not just ethnic but class and attitude) stereotypes that wear out their initial delivery of comical observation. Perhaps this book is just too long for what it is. I liked - not loved - Absurdistan, and I found this novel to be more heavily inflicted with the problems of that book. Sorry, I tried, just couldn't care enough to finish it."
3,good read - entertaining,"I struggled to get into this book and just about put it down when it caught me. Once I caught on, though, I read it almost straight through. The story is oddly confusing and I had to stop periodically to regain my footing. The plot is a romp through the East Coast and somewhere in Eastern Europe (why an imaginary country?) and, finally, back to the Midwest. More than that, though, it's a romp through the protagonist's mind and heart - he seems lost and never sure where to turn. He chases down opportunity and clings to anything easy and normal. In this way I thought it was a very modern book. Finally (and a little formulaic) he settles down to the good life, crazy past behind him.It's a good book and a good read. I didn't sense any great moral message (another hallmark of the modern novel) but found the book completely entertaining."
2,Tiring,"Starts off with verve and now about halfway through, I'm not sure that I'm going to hang in to the end. The humor has flagged, the plot unsatisfying and characters are cartoons. As other reviewers have indicated that the resolution is not satisfying, hardly seems worth continuing to plough through this."
1,Intelligent and Funny ?! You Must be Kidding !!!,"According to the reviews on the cover ""Ambitious, intelligent and funny"". How about boring and no imagination ? The book cover together with few first chapters is probably the most promising part of the book. But once it moves to the Eastern Europe it could sound funny and intelligent to people who don't know much about Russians and Prague (Oh yes, fictional Prava, is Prague, shocked ?). Prava is definitely not a product of the author's imagination as he claims in the book, people speak Czech, have Czech names and go to places everybody who has lived in Prague recognizes. You just keep wondering, why to combine the third rate gangster movie with the outsider ideas about the American expats in Eastern Europe and hope for a good debut . I would sure not compare Gary Shteyngart to Nabokov."
3,"Thoughtful protagonist, weak plot","This book is a good read, if not for anything else, Vladimir's insight and Shteyngart's lyrical and hillarious language.But the lack of action and compelling characters in Prague is the undoing of an otherwise great work. To be certain, the first half is much better than the second. The language is initially grounded - the image of Vladimir in New York insinuating his way into high society while maintaining a bohemian lifestyle resonated more for me than the platitudes of his social circle in Prague. More importantly, Shteyngard compromises the plot by introducing fantastic elements (blowing up the foot) that are better suited to outright farce.That said, I really enjoyed reading this book, could barely put it down and finished it in a week, It's flawed, but I'm looking forward to the next installment."
3,Russian Deb Review,"This book is very funny, but kind of a silly story.Writing and character studies are well done. Being that the plot is kind of ridiculous, it is hard to go along with the action. The dialogue is quite funny and keeps your interest. However, if I had known the type of book it was, I don't know whether or not I would buy it."
4,A book that lives up to the hype,"Finally, a book that lives up to the hype around it. Funny, manic, observant. Shteyngart brilliantly captures the absurd world of immigrant life; his language mirrors the the rhythms of natural-born New Yorkers and Russian immigrants. And in Volodka Girshkin (and his parents) he has created great comic heroes. My only criticism would be that the book could use some editing down. But all in all, a wild, funny ride and I highly recommend it."
1,"Not all that ""Intro"" at all","My undergrauate particle physics class use this book, and I can't complain enough about it! I am sure many in my class share the same opinion. I must admit that earlier reviews are right. It is a very comprehensive servey of high energy physics, but the writting is simply bad! It's so obscure, hard to understand, and extremely fragmented. Here is an event that should keep anyone interested from buying it. We were assigned a problem in the book as a homework problem. The professor later had to take it out of the problem set because appearntly, the problem concern a session of the book that's already TAKEN OUT of the 4th EDITION!!!!I would recommend Griffiths book, except that that book doesn't emphasize on concept as much I suppose...o well, it's your call...but I'd say: DROP THIS."
1,I hope that it isn't just me,"I just took an intro to particle physics class as a fifth year undergraduate who has had all of the usual courses that one is supposed to have to be able to at least gain a glimpse into the world of particles. This book by Perkins is one of the worst textbooks that I have ever had to use. The examples were limited if any, and the problems seemed not to correlate with the content of the chapters at all. The problems that I did work on I had to reference other texts just to get an idea of what he was talking about. I have to say that Griffiths' (whose EM book was great and his quantum book not all that bad) was much more mathematical and clear, as well as Halzen and Martin. I agree with the other comment. Get another book before ever buying this book. Plus my Professor was not too thrilled with it as well. I ended up buying the Griffiths text in the end, which helped a lot."
1,horrible book,"For those who have had to suffer through Perkins before switching to Griffiths, I gotta say that Perkins book will really make your life miserable. This books is terribly unorganized; speaks using concepts before explaining what they are. Perkins book is horrible compared to Griffiths. I don't know if it is the fact of how bad Perkins was that makes think that Griffiths book is fantastic, but I'm really glad I changed from this book, otherwise I would have miserably failed my particle physics class."
4,Be prepared before reading this.,"This is a book whose content is close to that of most 'traditional' undergraduate courses on particle physics. Yet, you will probably be tempted to throw it in the dustbin after a few pages unless you have trained yourself into thinking that it's better reading it than failing your exam and have already read a book like Giffiths' before, where you will find some good theoretical basis for all this stuff."
5,Great for medela pumps!,"I bought this when I was given a breast pump as a gift with no accessories. I wasn't sure if it was compatible but it was!! I was relieved! Took me some time to learn to use it correctly, but when I did it was quite easy. I love it and plan to use again for my next baby."
4,Great recap of a great season,"This is a must-read and must-own for anyone who loves the Mariners and followed that wonderfil 2001 season. The Seattle P-I's writers are terrific, and did a terrific job capturing the magic of this amazing season as it happened. And yes, the stories are right out of the paper - they're supposed to be.Book quality is excellent for a paperback. Print quality is great, too. Highly recommend this one."
1,I want a refund! (Should be zero stars),"Totally bizarre, clumsily plotted, the attention to detail (there is none), special effects (lame), any sort of real acting (zero & there was no script). I think I saw a paint ball gun in a few of the scenes. If I really looked at the cover & saw the Blackhawk. I should have known better. I don't know who the director is & I don't care. Uwe Boll received a rare ""Worst Career Achievement"" award at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards on February 21, 2009 for 1968 Tunnel Rats. I never thought I should have to google a movie before I rent it. Okay, I lost an hour and a half of my time (which I can't get back). I just want my money back.If you have a family member who served during the Vietnam War...don't rent or buy this!* I forgot to add - the place where I had the misfortune to rent this. They gave me a refund, and a free rental for another movie. They said ""I wasn't the only person who they gave a refund for this movie""."
2,Tunnel Rats misses its target...,"Tunnel Rats is a Vietnam war film by Uwe Boll. I'm not an Uwe Boll hater, but this film just doesn't hit the target. ( I do recommend you watch Uwe Boll's Rampage and Darfur though.) The acting was mostly bad from most of the actors; a lot of overacting and some dull dialogue. The special effects were also bad during the war scenes or when people got shot in general. Also, it didn't really tell a direct story, I couldn't tell if it was telling the American or Vietnamese story because it doesn't really bother to develop characters or clearly develop the conflict. The tunnel scenes were claustrophobic and slightly exciting, though. And I did like the atmosphere it built. It did go by fast so the packing was great.Overall, I don't recommend buying this film. If you have Netflix Streaming, it is available as of 7/1/12 if you want to check it out.Tunnel Rats has blood and gore through its violent war scenes."
2,MIA--MOVIE IS ATROCIOUS,"Gave two stars because at least almost everybody gets killed in the end--which given the low quality of acting is meet and just. When you get past the amateur direction, the ludicrous ""military"" sets, the absence of acting talent, the disastrous dialogue--you arrive at the end credits. Give this to your claustrophobic friends for their birthday. Or buy two copies of the DVD and throw them both out."
3,Better than the reviews suggest,"While this movie may not have had the budget as films such as Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, this was actually a better movie than some of these reviews might suggest. I can't help but to read between the lines of the negative reviews, the American Patriotic fervor that cannot handle films depicting anything other than that ""we are the best"" bravado mentality and we NEVER lose.This appears to be a fairly accurate depiction of a specific aspect of the Vietnam war and from that which is much more of a drama based film. If you want to see a dramatic and fairly accurate movie you'll probably enjoy this. If you're looking for the 'American Military that always Kick A**' that never loses a battle, then you might want to pass on this one."
1,Jacket Cover,Since when did they have Blackhawks during Vietnam? I don't think I'll even attempt to watch it if the DVD jacket cover isn't somewhat historically accurate.
4,Surprisingly Good,I am shocked to be saying that Uwe Boll's Tunnel Rats is an absolute gem of a war movie. I usually find Boll's movies laughable but not only did this movie capture the hell and absurdity of war but it did it from both the American and Viet Cong point of view. The tunnel scenes were amazing and if you are claustrophobic you will have a real tough time with this. I was on the edge of my seat for most of it. Some surprisingly good acting and dialogue made this movie not only a rental for me but I will also be purchasing it for my collection.
2,Amateur Hour,I am giving the movie 2 stars only because of the body count and action. Spoiler alert: Where was the perimeter of defense for the base camp? Where were the trip wires and claymores? The enemy literally walked in and began slaughter. Why would they enter the tunnels with their pistol over their head and not in front of them? The producer/director could and should have used a military technical advisor. As a 40 year military and police veteran in my oipinion the tactics were totally wrong and suicidal.
4,Great Info for the Hoya Curious.,"This books' greatest asset is the index of over 100 pictures of many species that represent this genus. It shows the diversity of these plants and their habitats. Also has chapters on cultivation with points regarding in-house and greenhouse growth. Chapters about taxonomy and the vegetative structures also make for interesting reading. If you are having difficulty finding information about what part of a Hoya flower is what or would like a good reference book, this is it!"
3,Good if you want eco friendly,"I love that this product is eco friendly and approved for use with cloth diapers. It also smells really nice. I just wish it removed stains a bit better. It does get out the worst of it but my cloth diapers come out stained. When I tried a traditional stain remover, they were completely clean. I will probably still use it because I don't want to damage the cloth diapers in the long run, I just wish it was a bit stronger."
5,"Charlie's Soap Laundry Pre-Spray, 16.9 Ounce",We use this on adult clothes - this will take off the grease stain - from food spill or even working in the garage. Spray on the stain at least 30 mins before wash & laundry comes out clean. I have been using it for the last 1.5 years.
2,This is not Laundry Pre-spray!,"The item I ordered was the Charlie's Soap Laundry Pre-Spray. The item I received was Charlie's Soap All Purpose Cleaner. I'm sure the cleaner works great, but it's not what I ordered."
5,Magic Pre-wash,"I have never used such an amazing pre-wash before and I've been doing laundry for 47 years!What I like about it is that you can spray a potential trouble spot the minute you see it.Store the dirty item in the hamper and then, at your leisure, wash it!"
1,Not all purpose,"I was very hopeful that this product would be all purpose. It's not. I tried it on fresh coffee spilled on the carpet and it did not clean it at all. I spilled spaghetti sauce on a white Tshirt, rinsed it and sprayed the cleaner on the stain, washed the shirt twice and the stain remains. Would not recommended it"
3,prewash treatment,"This is an excellent product. I highly recommend. It is especially great for towels and sheets. You should never have to buy softener again, unless you just want to add nice smells or extra softness. Eliminates static electricity completely."
5,Hits the spot!,I bought this spray to use primarily on my laundry and it has been great. I keep a bottle in my baby's nursery and spray the soiled cloth diapers before I toss them in the pail and they come out pretty much stain free from the laundry (I also use the powdered soap for my laundry).
3,"Good, not great..and talk about a chemical smell!","I love Charlie's Laundry Soap, and wanted to give their AP Cleaner a try. I purposely waited to clean my shower until I received my little bottle. I do agree that it cleans well, but it has a horrible chemical smell. It's not even a ""clean"" smell, but more of a harsh scent you would expect to find from Kaboom, or another product. It does take soap scum off very easily, but because of the harsh smell, and the fact that my tongue felt stripped of all it's taste's buds due to the fumes...and me breathing them in. I think I'll stick to Comet with bleach. I will stick to Charlie's Laundry Soap though...that stuff is awesome!"
2,This prewash doesn't work.,"Don't waste your money on Charlie's prewash spray. I tried it on our clothes to get out wine and food stains but all the stains remained on our clothes after washing thoroughly. I followed the directions on the bottle which stated, for best results, spray it on the stain and wait for at least 30 minutes--still didn't work at all. It was like I didn't use anything at all. So, I ended up getting the stains out with oxyclean laundry stain remover, which is way cheaper anyway.Also, Charlie's prewash has a very strong chemical smell, like 409 or something. Just a very disappointing product."
5,Love,Great for cloth diapering. It really gets the stains out and smells clean and fresh. I have used it on other laundry stains and they all come out in the first wash. Make sure to let it soak for at least 30 minutes.
4,Good Item,"This book is really very good,impressive and informatic for both children and teachers. This is also a good educational base fo new learners. Helpul to learn easily."
1,This is NOT Praxis,"If you're expecting Bootsy or Laswell on Bass, Brain on drums and Buckethead on guitar you're looking in the wrong place. Lo-fi beats and squiggly samples from Laswell's early stuff in the 80's. There is nothing redeeming on this album and shouldn't bear the Praxis name."
3,"OK, just not perfect","Just as advertised, came as promised, no problem with getting what I paid for, I simply realized why the dealers won't sell this moulding without the entire plastic cowling included. It's just too difficult (for me) to get the moulding to fit neatly between the glass and plastic. I ended up using half a tube of clear silicon caulk, smooth by finger, and live with the jokes about my aging minivan."
5,Great good night book,My daughter enjoys reading this every night. She loves the little counting stars and the light up moon at the end is a real pleaser. This is a great gift and a book thats not always at the store.Emma
2,Not the same mustard,"This product disappeared from grocery store shelves, so I went hunting for it online because it was my favorite honey mustard. Unfortunately, they've changed the formula and it's just like all of the other high sugar honey mustard products on the market. I had to buy 6 of them, so I'm going to take the rest to the food pantry since it doesn't work so well for the recipe that I use."
4,Great Alternative Study Guide!,"The detailed checklists are very helpful additions to any 1L's study guides. They help to organize the case law and black letter law into easy to follow flow charts, which show how each builds on the next. My only criticism is that, since the law constantly updates, the guide should be updated. There were some more recent cases that were not included in the guide."
4,effective,"It is good for the purpose of learning Civ Pro as a 1L. Some hypos are good and others are questionable. But overall, it is good. Serves its purpose. I like Glannon's E&E and MCQ better."
4,Algebra refresher booklet,The Algebra booklet published by Carson-Dellosa is a 120 page review of Algebra skills for Middle or High-School. Each page covers one topic and the pages are reproducible for multiple students. There are twelve overall chapters addressing the rules of Algebra all the way to calculating and applying rational equations. The exercises can be used as a refresher course or add on to an Algebra 1 class.Included is also a blank worksheet for graphs.
4,Important,"Ellen Cannon Reed's book on the interface between Kabbalah and Witchcraft is an important work. For Pagan's interested in using the Practical Kabbalh in their magick, it is a good place to begin. The best feature of the book is the relating of the Sefiroth (the spheres on the Tree of Life) to the passages in the Charge of the Goddess. I deducted one star for the ambiguities surrounding the practice of Rising on the Planes. The technique given for this is not, in fact, Rising on the Planes, but a description of a useful technique for attuning to the energies of a particular Sephrira in preparation for actual pathworking. Despite this drawback (one which is unfortunatly all too common in books on Practical Kabbalah) Reed's book is excellent and should be on every Witch's shelf. Very highly reccomended."
4,Taxiride Charts New Ground,"Having heard and loved both Imaginate and Garage Mahal, I have to say that Axiomatic is a new direction for Taxiride. And it's a great one too. While the songs and the general feel of the record are far more intense, I find that Jason's voice has never sound better and the harmonies are well in place. And the band has never sounded tighter.You can tell that here's a band who are deeply influenced by 70's rock and they indulge this passion while maintainig acontemporary production and stylistc edge. I love Oh Yeah and What Can I Say. Axiomatic is not a singles album it's an experiece. I can't wait for the next album."
2,Total Deception !!,"Sorry, but it's a total deception. Isn't a bad album but nothing compares to Imaginate & Garage Mahal. Taxiride is my favorite band but this album contains only 3 or 4 songs with the Taxiride level."
2,"Not terrible, but not great.","Taxiride's first two albums are incredible. This one was a big disappointment. I would love to see this bank make a comeback, but unfortunately I don't see that happening."
3,half good,"I figure a half good cd by Taxiride is better than most full cds of other groups in their pop/rock genre. This cd is more of a mellow affair with keyboards playing a major part. It sounds like they wanted to try something different this time out.Some of the songs seem to sound incomplete. Nation is probably the strongest song on the cd;Oh Yeah is also noteworthy; You gotta help me sounds unfinished; tripper red I don't get at all!Imaginate and Garage Mahal cds had less flaws than this cd so get those first if you are new to Taxiride. Axiomatic needs a few listens to understand; I disliked the whole cd at first, but it does grow on you. Try the new cd by The Duke (member of Stuck Mojo). It is similar to the best of Taxiride which doesn't make sense in a way if you ever heard Stuck Mojo(rap/rock) but it is a very mature album with a good message and strong songs"
5,The 1st film written specifically for the talents of L&H,"This was the first film that was written just for L&H.;Ollie is an upstanding pillar of the community. But he is being paid a visit by his cousin Phillip (Stan) from Scotland. Stan isa woman chasing, kilt wearing, scotsman on his first visit to america. He can`t figure out why he draws so much attention andisn`t having any of Ollie`s attempts to put him into a pair of pants."
5,Their beauty alone is enough to weaken my knees.,"I have seen these unbelievably talented, gorgeous women in concert four times. In Saarbrücken, I was astounded by these girl's amazing dancing skills. In Darmstadt, I fell in love with the angelic voices I'd heard. And, for my most exciting and unforgetable Valentine's day gift ever, I witnessed two performances in one night in Idar Oberstein and Homburg, so spectacular, I frequently found myself gasping for breath. After such breathtaking performances I immediately purchased the entire CD and am completely satisfied with it. I strongly urge any person with an ear for upcoming talent to purchase this CD as quickly as possible. If you have the chance to witness these girls in concert, I strongly encourage it...and you will come away speechless."
3,"Pretty Good,......... but, I'm still waiting!","Let me say first, that ""Rain"" by New Direction is a pretty good CD. But, personally, I'm still waiting for them to put out something that meets or exceeds their first offering. (the self titled ""New Direction"")The songs are all good, but they're somewhat ""generic"". There's not much that's unique about this CD. Their first CD quickened my spirit with the level of sincerity and commitment that came through. There's nothing here that moves me to the level of praise that I know that they are capable of moving people to. I'm still waiting!"
1,:(,The first review i made for my 7th heaven season 3 product i thought was great but its not. the sixth disc does not work at all. they came in the factury seal with plastic around it but the 2 discs will not work. im hoping that they will exchange this for me and send me another brand new season 3 of 7th heaven so i can actually watch it.
2,7TH HEAVEN THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON,I CAN'T PLAY IT IT KEEP STOPPING ON ME I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING SOMETHING MUST BE WRONG WITH THE DVD AND THIS IS WITH FIRST DISC.
5,Awesome,"The first time my sister shared this CD with me, I fell in love with it. I love every song on the CD."
5,Excellent,We used this as a favor at a retirement dinner for a tire sales man. Looked great smelled great tasted great.
2,stained,This would be a great hamper if it were not for the black ink stains all over it. I sent the first one back because of the stains that come from the Hello Kitty outline. The second replacement hamper has the same horrible stains all over it!
1,Not as high quality as other brands,I bought and use these for a dog zip line in my back yard for our outside dogs. They last about one to two months before wearing the bearing and wheel completely out. The other major brand that can be bought in most hardware stores lasts about 6 months.
5,I really love the simplicity and depth of this book,"I'm not a widow, but this book brings peace to the soul as it is read...I love knowing that all those other people are agreeing with me in prayer every day, for the different prayers that is at the end of each page."
4,Great bargain - with limitations.,"I'm going to speak directly to the other graphic designers since they are the customers most likely to be interested in this product and will know what I'm talking about. This collection has a wide variety of images. Not just inanimate objects but lots of people doing lots of things. However every image is at 72 dpi and not very physically large. They can be resampled, of course. But I opened an image that was 13"" tall, resampled to 300 dpi and it went down to about 3"". But for $50 what do you expect. Still, as I said, there are all kinds of images as long as you don't need them to be any larger than 1.5"" to 3"". And if you are working in greyscale you might be able to get some more size out of them.Your absolute best deal is the Encore/Broderbund ""ClickArt Professional"" for about $80. Those images are at 72 dpi but very physically big."
2,Not Good : (,"Not what I expected! Yes, it has many, many, many images but most of them are repeated many times. The pictures don't have a professional look, it's complicated. And, let's say, you're looking for an ""ice cream"", you know, just an ice cream... you'll find one or two and the rest is images of people eating an ice cream, or ice cream cars, or ice cream makers, or ice cream boxes, but not many options of ice cream photo objects! In a software like this, you'll expect to find only ""Photo Objects"", but no! Most of them are just photos, and I was looking for photo OBJECTS! That simple. So not worth the $50+ I paid! Come on, ""software companies"" out there...please come up with something really professional, really cool, easy to work with on Macs! I'm sure most of us will pay any amount for an awesome product, as long as we get exactly what we're looking for in a piece of software! What the f@*% is this? The Twilight Zone?!!!"
4,Excellent for what it is,"If you need photos of people and objects, with no background, then this clipart package is great. One warning, some of the photos are so staged that they scream 'clipart' but if you pick carefully you won't have any problems."
3,great,"Great artwork!The browsing utility could use a major overall though. Please keep this up to date, as a poor browsing program makes the wonderful photos unobtainable."
1,Remarkably Poor Design,"Wow, this is poorly done. Impossible to keep it standing in upright position. Clearly, no one at Sennheiser has used one of these. The batteries and cables enter through the bottom faceplate and it barely contains the lot. If you can get the faceplate back on and the cables in their little grooves at all, you'll then be surprised to find that it made no difference since the thing falls over anyway - and then the plate pops off!! Outrageous.I've used other Sennheiser products and been pleased but this product was a disappointment. And, the idea that this could be used in a call center environment is laughable.On a side note: I would buy Sennheiser again. I have been very happy with my USB, over the ear headset I use with Skype. Very comfortable, and extremely good sound isolation and quality."
2,Not for beginning Home Networks,If you want a book to walk you thru setting up a simple Samba file server for a basic network with a couple of Windows clients this ain't the one. Jumps around and assumes you're real proficient with Linux and glosses over the many errors that occur when first setting up the network. Kind of like a Microsoft text that assumes that everything works beautifully as you follow the step by step guide. I got to page 39 before everything just failed.Then off to the newsgroups.If you're a relative beginner shop carefully for the text you need.
5,Best book I have read in a very long time.,"I saw this book advertised in the Rapid City Journal last week and bought a copy. I am not much of a reader but I must say that I enjoyed The Turning Point more than any other book I have read in the last couple of years. Please let me know when book 2 comes out, I will buy it sight unseen!"
5,I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!!!,A friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday. I stayed up until midnight finishing it! It is a fun book to read and has inspired me to make the career change I have been so reluctant to make. I have recommended it to many of my friends as a result.
5,THIS BOOK IS AWESOME!,I love the Turning Point by Crystal Rose. It is the best book I have read in a long time.
5,"transforming, inspiring, easy to read","This book gave me several 'excercises' to use in evaluating my own life, priorities, and direction. I found myself changing where I put my energies so I can look back and know my life was my choice - And I choose happiness. All this and it was FUN to read!!"
5,I believe this book changed my life,"I really enjoyed reading about Maria and Rose. I have always had a very difficult time loving myself and this book really opened my eyes. As I read about Rose learning lessons about life, I found myself applying these lessons to my own life. I laughed until my sides split and cried a river. It was just superb!!"
4,More Sould - Hank Crawford,Hank Crawford was one of the more talented sax virtuosos of our time. He seems to have been inspired by the great Charlie 'Bird' Parker and stepped out into some great innovative areas during his career.
3,"If you're looking for pictures, then this book is for you.","If you need great pictures to help you in your search for Care Bear items, then this book is for you. However, some of the pictures are mislabeled and some items are not even shown. As someone else pointed out, the prices seem to be overinflated. If you're just starting out, this book can help you identify stuff. But, there are great collectors out there, some who have their own web pages, who are more than willing to help you out in your search."
5,A wonderful book for Care Bear collectors both big and small,This book is very well done. It is extreamly accurate and has helped me through some hard times selecting how much to pay for a bear. It's a great book for Care Bear Collecters both Young and Old.
2,Close but no Cigar....,"I bought the Care Bear book mainly to see what else was available besides just the plushes and posables, however, when I went to look at the minis---there are none of the Care Bear Cousin minis pictured or even mentioned! I know the pics come out of a private collection but a mention of these would be helpful. Also, there was not info on all the posables' accessories! There was no mention of the British Bears or the ultra rare Care Bear Cousins. Prices were not too terribly out of line in comparison to what I have sold items for in the past. On a positive note, pics were nice and the author showed lots of neat Care Bear items."
4,Very sensitive,"I don't have much experience with microphones, but this one captures good sound detail - amazingly so. Initially I was getting distortion on my recordings even on the lowest setting, till I realized my microphone volume in the windows sound panel was at 100%. Cranking this down to 25-50% fixed it. As I said, incredibly sensitive - never ran into that issue with my previous headset mic.It also captures more voice bass than real life, so you'll need to do some EQ in a program like Audacity to get proper sound. After a white noise removal and EQ you get a nice pristine recording. It's an affordable option for anyone who is interested in podcasting or any sort of amateur voice work."
4,"EUROPE'S LAST--""LONG""--SUMMER","It is amazing that the leader most opposed to war was the Kaisar, who ended up watching as his country started one. And the leader most in favor of Slav rights was the Arch-Duke, who died by the hand of a Slav who wanted more rights. You've probably heard the saying about if you don't want the answer then don't ask the question........If you really want to know about every twist and turn of how Europe found itself in a world war then this is the book for you. But..If you wanted a concise discussion you've come to the wrong place.To any student of history, professional or amateur, I would say read this book, it will open your eyes, but take it in small bites."
4,Small book - big info,"The chapters were jam-packed with wise insight into the making of a mature disciple. Although I thought the author overdid the use of analogies in making his points, I found the book instructive and inspiring overall."
5,AAAAAAAAAAAAA The best Vietnam book yet,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPlatoon tells the story of a platoon in the nam. From the start to the end it is action and all too realistic. The storyline is fantastic. My fav book of all time.
5,Twins love it so much I have to buy another!,"We wore out the first Jungle Bus Book! I am now shopping for another. My son loves it so much that when the back cover broke off, I had to put it up. He goes around the house saying I want Jungle Bus, I want Jungle Bus. So I carefully let him look at it and then we read it together. His twin sister LOVES to point out the Snake, Frogs and birds on each page. She even has started to learn how to count the animals. I even like to read it every night! I can't say that the rest of the books that we have."
2,Not Instructional,"Benson is a jaw-droppingly great guitarist on his records. Sadly, on this Hot Licks DVD, he noodles around for 90 minutes on two out-of-tune and toneless guitars without explaining what he is doing and why. As another reviewer wrote, some talented people are not necessarily good teachers. For excellent instruction, I recommend the DVDs by Joe Pass and Danny Gatton."
1,Thanks for the warning... teaching is a separate skill..,"Thanks for the warning about the George Benson DVD. This one sounds like another ""If I sh** on a DVD, people will buy it because I'm a star."" Sorry George, being a star doesn't absolve you from the responsibilty work that is required to present an organized, logical presentation for STUDENTS. Too many of you guys who are ""Stars"" think that just showing up to a video taping, and jamming a little constitues an instructional video. What it does constitute is abuse of your position. Put the work in to create a genuine educational tool, and all will repect it. Remember teaching is a separate skill from playing. As in the engineeing and math worlds, great engineers and mathematicians frequently make lousy teachers. Teaching is a separate skill."
3,Escape,"French pop flavor creates sweet silky intrigue in the Latitudes remix. Cerrone's Music of Life is a disco blast from the past with subtle energy. Waves and Sun has Caribbean appeal. Femi Kuti has tribal beats that open into echoes begging you to escape from urban playgrounds. Kojak provides a jazzy interlude with lyrics. The idea of the entire album seems to be escape and by the time you get to the Love Theme, you imagine this was what you expected the album would be about from the start. The last two tracks are the highlight of the album. Desert is dreamy and emotive and worth the wait.~The Rebecca Review"
3,Worried about the vibration,"I agree with the previous reviewer about the vibration. It was significant enough that I thought the unit might be defective and returned it for a replacement. It made no difference. I was able to reduce much of the vibration noise by mickey-mousing it with duct tape between some of the contact points. However, significant vibration remains and I worry that the light bulb's life may be reduced because of it. I guess we'll see."
2,Noisy,"I purchased and installed two fans. Much to my surprise, I found both fans to be noisy as a result of vibration of the bezel and lens cover. Like some other purchasers I wound up making some rubber gaskets to quit the fans."
5,Pleased... As expected :),"I already owned a Minka Concept II 48"" ceiling fan so I already knew what to expect from the 52"" version in terms of features. However, I was a little concerned as to whether or not the unit would be able to provide enough cooling air flow with just another 4"". I am pleased to say that it did. I went with another Concept II as I was not able to find another low profile fan with as much style for a significantly lower price. I had installed a few other fans but they were either not powerful enough or hung lower than I like for my 8' ceiling. Once I got it in & installed, I knew I had made the right choice even though my initial efforts led me away from this particular fan. Great product."
3,Fair,"Minka-Aire Fans F518-BN 44"" Concept II Contemporary Flush Mount Nickel Ceiling Fan w/ Light, RemoteI purchased (2) of these fans a few years ago. The 44"" for the bedroom is fantastic and works great. The 52"" for the front room doesn't produce as much power anymore. Further the #2 switch on the remote for middle power when hit puts the fan on high power & the #3 switch which is supposed to be high speed is now middle power. Maybe there is a flaw with the 52"" as the 44"" is perfect & more powerful."
2,Easy to Install and works very well,"The fan is as described: quiet, easy to install and works well. It is a bit noisy on the high speed but overall a very good value. The amount of light from the light kit is sufficient as an evening light for a normal sized bedroom."
5,Great Fan!,"We have installed several ceiling fans in our house over the years. This was by far the easiest to install and we love the looks and quality. Wasn't too happy that we had to purchase the wall control seperately. Personally, I would rather have the wall control than the remote control but we love the fan!"
4,Easy,to install and a unique look. Relatively quiet yet effective at moving air. I plan to use them throughout my condo as I renovate.
5,Ceiling fan,Well made; strong base with good motor. Ordered both wall switch and it came with remote. Very modern looking and attractive for a pretty elegant bedroom
5,great fan!,"I love this fan! i got 3 of the 52"". my ceilings are low; these hug the ceiling; previous fans hung down lower and seemed to take up part of the room. very quiet; basically silent at low speed, still very quiet at levels 2 and 3. got brushed nickel - they look great and throw off a lot of air for air flow. easy controls. light dims. Ordered 2 more 42"" for smaller bedrooms."
5,Great Ceiling fan,"I bought this ceiling fan to help decrease my heat costs. My wall furnace was running constantly due to cold drafts near the heater's thermostat sensor. After I installed this ceiling fan and set the rotation for winter/heating use, the room temperature evened out considerably and the heater stopped running 24/7. I have been leaving the fan on the lowest speed all day and night and I have not noticed a big increase in my electric bill. I love the look of this fan -- It is large and chunky looking, but it fits my room perfectly. If you have a larger room, want a modern look, require silent operation, and need very efficient air flow with low operating costs, this is the fan for you. I can't wait to see how well it cools the room in the summer. I am sure it will do a great job of that, too."
2,Minka Aie F519 vs Casablanca C30G11H,"I had the Minka Aire F519 fan installed for 5 days and spent a bit more and replaced it with a Casablanca C30G11H. Both are 52"" fans.1. The Minka Aire exhibits motor hum at middle and high speeds. The Casablanca has no detectable hum.2. The Minka Aire does not necessarily mount cleanly to the ceiling. The Casablanca has a mounting ring which gives a flush clean look with no mounting screws visible.3. The Minka Aire housing has a bulky look to it. The Casablanca, in comparison, looks more elegant."
5,Absolutely love this fan!,"Amazing ceiling fan, no motor hum at all, even on highest setting. Clean, sleek, almost blends into the ceiling. I like that it's somewhat contemporary, yet not overly so which could date it in a few years. 3 of these fans in 3 upstairs bedrooms keep not only the bedrooms cool, but the entire upstairs when the doors are left open. One word of caution, fan is extremely heavy so a bar attached to joints must be installed or something to hold this fan firmly. This will also keep the fan from wobbling. I've seen reviews that this fan doesn't sit flush to the ceiling (approximately a 1""-1/2"" gap), so my contractor mounted the box higher into the ceiling to compensate for this. The fan now sits flush and looks beautiful!! It's worth it to hire a contractor to achieve the flush look. Hands down the best ceiling fan I've experienced yet."
4,"Very nice and simple, good for low ceilings","It's great, but I wouldn't call it super quiet. Remember that it takes a while after you hit the ""reverse"" button for the fan to actually start reversing, at first the installer thought it was broken. I did have to replace one because the motor was loud and the remote receiver stopped working."
1,Terrible fan,I bought one of these fans and installed it. It works fine so I bought two more. The second one works okay. It wobbles but probably just needs to be balanced (I hope). The third fan was a disaster. The light bulb exploded a few hours after turning it on. When it exploded it shattered the light dome. My 4 year old son was in the room but fortunately was not hit by the glass. I wasn't quite so lucky but just had some minor cuts. I contacted minka air via e-mail 3 times and never heard back. Now the fan motor hums loudly when I turn it on. I can't use it as a light. I can't use it as a fan. I can't return it. I'm out $300. Terrible experience.
2,Dissapointed,I purchased this fan based on customer reviews and a 7 FT ceiling. On low speed the fan is silent but you can barely feel any breeze. On medium the fan motor hums and you get the amount of wind you would expect on low. On High the motor hum increases yet again. We use the fan in our bedroom and are forced to ONLY use it on low speed due to the humming noise on any other speed. The remote works well but the dimmer for the light is retarded. Giving the fan 2 stars just because i like the looks of it and the installation is super easy!
4,Nice smooth fan,"Quiet and smooth fan. The design is nice an unique. The halogen is bright and provides additional lighting to the room so that was nice.We hired an electrician to install it. It didn't seem too complicate. However, the receiver circuit shorted after installation. We called Minka and they sent out a replacement within a few days.This is our third Minka fan and we're very happy with it. We've had it for less than 6 months so I cannot attest to its durability (except for the initial shorted receiver)."
3,Terrific fan,"This is a terrific fan. An electrician installed it for me and commented on the quality of the design and ease of installation. The wall control is fantastic. The fan reverses so that it helps keep an even temperature on both warm and cool days. The light is bright enough to light up my 13 x 14' living room, but also has a dimmer control, so it's not overbearing. It's rated for wet areas. I live in an old cabin in the woods, an area where there is a lot of rain and leaky roofs are a normal part of life. It also has a low ceiling, and the fan looks great on the ceiling. It was a perfect choice.Update:The fan itself is terrific. Changing the lightbulb is not. The bulb burned lasted six months. It is extremely difficult to remove the glass shade. I cannot do it by myself and will have to bring in someone to help with it. Not a happy camper right now."
3,Clicking nosie,"I have had this fan for about 18 months, but it has developed a clicking noise. I have checked the blades, and the mounting to the ceiling with no luck. The noise seems to becoming from the motor. I was expecting the fan to hold up better, it is not run more than a couple hours a day during the summer months. For some reason the reverse feature stopped working as well when I press it on the remote. Based on the issues I have encountered I can not recommend this fan to others."
3,Did not last,"Did not stay with me, disappointed in the product. It was not lasting, seems three hours after applying scent was gone. I did like the roll-on."
2,Patchouli Pretender,"My initial response to the scent of this oil was not favorable. It had a medicinal odor rather than the rich patchouli scent I was hoping for. I thought perhaps my olfactory receptors were ""off"" so I shared the oil with five of my patchouli-savy friends and asked for their honest opinions. They are as follows: Licorace, Anise(basically, the same as licorace), Disinfectant, Unpleasant, and Slightly Herbal(close to patchouli, but not close enough). You can see, not one of us thought it smelled enough like patchouli to wear the name. I hate to toss it, but certainly won't wear it. Live and learn."
3,Recommended hardware requirements too low,"For some reason the program works for me. I have a P4 (3Ghz) with 1GB of RAM. Available HD space is about 40 GB. I made a 75-minute video with added transitions and sound and burned it to a DVD, it took about 3.5 hrs. to complete. The computer ran very slow during this process. Tech support said the software must complete the ""rendering"" process twice before it will burn to a disc. Personally, I think the minimum hardware requirement is a fast P4 with 1GB of RAM and lots of room on the HD, anything less may lock up the computer. I also downloaded the latest patches. The program will still lock up my computer at times... Steve"
2,Product with good features IF you can get it too work.,After finally rendering my project after multiple crashes and burning to a DVD the the audio was out of sync with the video and nothing I tried would remedy the problem. It can't be my computer as I have twice the specs the program requires. I am very disappointed with this program. Before buying this wait until a new version comes out and they have worked out all the bugs in this one.
1,Software does not work,This software did not install properly on my XP system. I have installed dozens of other products without any problem. Only the Pinnacle Studio software did not install. I checked Pinnacle's user forum web site - it appears many customers are having the same problem trying to get this software to install.
3,Has more bugs than a roach motel!!,"Let's face it!! Mike Tyson OFF his medication is MORE stable than studio 9!! I give a 3 star rating only because of the ease of use. What a shame. It seems, at first, to be such a good video editor. But, after a short while..........BOOM!! Crash!! Constant program errors causes program to shut down thus losing all your edited work (unless you save your work every 30 seconds or so). Installed patch...... same crap!! It's not my PC. I have a very powerful Gateway PC, fully loaded, only a month old. I really hope they fix this problem!!"
1,Like the EASE of USE but ...,"I give this program 1 star because:- Additional purchases of keys to unlock for more features are required. Ex. to use 5.1 audio channel you will need to pay $10.00.- Rendering process takes helly long time to finish and freeze your computer all the time.- The video capture frees the computer and stops after capturing 45 min as well (due to technical prolems with Window).- Burn the disc image to my hardrive but when I burn it to my DVD, the project always stop at 85%. I went back to edit and redo for more than 3 times and still cannot make it work.- The website sells the program for users who want to upgrade to the new version (v.10) more expensive than the Amazon website sells."
2,Read these reviews before you don't buy!,"Wow, looks like I'm not alone in my pissedoffedness of Pinnacle Studio 9. The board is easy enough to install, and I got no complaints about the 1.2Gig of software you have to load before you fire this tool up, but I do have a HUGE problem with the 69Mb ""patch"" you have to download from Pinnacle's website in order to make this product semi-functional. Yes, sixty-nine meg, and it WILL NOT WORK without it!I have been able to successfully render short clips of 5 minutes or less in decent quality, but as another reviewer wrote this product is useless for creating DVDs in any length. Maybe if you're running a Cray or something you might be able to make this work, but as it is Studio 9 is way too unstable, and the DVD authoring process is just too damn slow, even on a 3.2G P4 with 2Gig of memory.Sorry, I cant tell you what to buy instead, I can only tell you that you wont be happy with Studio 9. At under $80 it's cheap for a reason."
2,Pinnacle Studio 9 Does Not Deliver,"As others have stated, this program has lots of bugs and the company provides little support. Adobe Premiere Elements knocks the socks off Studio 9, and you can buy it and Photoshop Elements bundled on Amazon for less than the retail price of Studio. Save yourself the frustration and headaches of Studio 9 and buy Adobe Premiere elements."
1,Expensive Piece of Junk,"I bought both Studio 8 and Studio 9 and I was disappointed with both of the products:Studio 81. It can't import movies made by Windows MovieMaker;2. It can't use MP3 files; you have to load a CD and it slowly reads the track before you can use it;3. Menu creation is buggy;4. It crashes a lot!Studio 91. It still can't load movies made by WIndows MovieMaker;2. Buggy audio track editing. Very bad routine for adjusting music track volume;3. Created blank clips when I tried to create an AVI file on the hard disk;4. Bad organization of video, music, image collections;5. Crashes a lot6. Menu creation is more buggy7. Menu artwork looks cheesy!I still have not created a DVD using these 2 products.If you're reading this, I beg you not to buy this product. Just use Windows MovieMaker -- it's simpler to use with not a lot of distractions. Then just buy Sonic MyDVD 5.3 to create the menus and burn the AVI files to DVD."
2,"Many good features, but to many bugs....","Easy to use, and many good features, but a lot of trouble because of bugs and bugs and bugs ...You can add patches, in my case from 9.0 to 9.1 to 9.3 to 9.4, but still many bugs.My biggest problem right now is that I can't add transitions to the 2nd of my project."
2,"Lots of Features, Tons of Bugs","Do not buy. I used it for several years; loved the features, hated the crashing and bugs. When it worked it was great. When it didn't you wanted to burn your computer. I ""upgraded"" to Studio 10 when it came out, and it was much much worse. Two stars for Studio 9, Zero stars for Studio 10. I switched to Sony Vegas Movie Studio 6.0 - very stable, hard to learn to use, but once you get there, it's a great program. Not for the novice though."
4,What a tease!,"I usually use Sony's Screenblast Movie Studio for editing my movies, but decided to give Pinnacle Studio (Version 9) a try. I like it a lot! It does, however, take up much more space than Screenblast does, and it seems it uses the same amount of transitions and effects and what not. I also didn't like that they included bonus transitions called Hollywood FX. They had so many!! I thought they would be all mine, but I found out that you had to purchase / unlock them for $14.95 a bundle."
1,I Agree With The Majority --- IT DON'T WORK,"I bought this in the spring of 2005 and looked at it but did really use it until recently. As has been stated everything about this product is great until you actually try to make a DVD and then NOTHING! It renders for hours and finally fails. I've been trying every which way I could think of and really ended up here trying to find yet another ""tip"" on the internet to get this thing to work."
1,Very Bad,"I'm having the same issues eaveryone else here is having.I have a Pentium 4 2.4GHz, 1GB RAM, 120GB hard drive space free.Don't waste your time with this software."
1,Grrrrrrrrrr...don't buy even if it's $5!,"My husband and I looked high and low for a video editing program that would support quicktime. We have a KODAK digital camera that records video in quicktime, which WINDOWS MOVIE maker doesn't support. My husband researched (all night) the net and was leaning towards POWER DIRECTOR 3 (CyberLink). Before we made a purchase (that if we didn't like we couldn't return) he called the network guy at his company. He recommended THIS PINNACLE DISASTER. We installed it, and then immediately installed ""THE PATCH"". A huge file in itself. It still wouldn't work. If you have a KODAK digital camera. Or if the digital camera you own saves it's video files as quicktime, don't buy this program. My husband WAS able to return the PINNACLE DISASTER (he convinced them the box hadn't been opened) and in turn he bought the POWER DIRECTOR 3. It worked great! AND it supports quicktime movies."
3,Has more bugs than a roach motel!!,"Let's face it!!! Mike Tyson off his medication is MORE stable than this piece of dung!!! Though it is easy to use, you better save your work every, let's say, 30 seconds or so! Constant program errors cause program to shut down. Worst $$$ I ever spent!! I should have listen to the masses and tried NERO 6. And NO!!! It's not my PC! I have a very powerful Gateway, brand new, fully loaded. Everything else seems to work except Pinnacle Studio 9. The program is more unstable even AFTER I downloaded the patch from Pinnacle web site. What a shame! It seems like such a user friendly product, but has a lot of bugs. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because the ease of use. Other than that....1 STAR!!!!"
4,Great Software,"Great video editing software. It's fast and easy to learn. It's a big memory hog, though, I had to add memory and uninstall all non-essential apps. The online support was great."
4,My view,"This is a good product that I first started with a few years ago. I then up-graded it to a very expensive editing software called Pinnacle Liquid Pro. It has come time for me to install my liquid pro to a new computer but, since I had lost my Studio 9 install disc, and it has to be installed on the new computer first before Liquid pro will install, I had to find another Studio 9 install disc to do so. I am very thankful I was able to find this Studio 9 version, still sealed in the box, making it now possible for me to install the program I love so much.Studio 9 is a good starter software for editing and creating videos, and works great for someone that is just a novice and has no need for the higher editing power. There are times, because of its simplicity, I will still pull it up for some quick and easy project that Studio 9 will handle with ease."
1,Terrible product - HOPELESS support!,"I won't go in the long and boring details about the level of anger and frustration I feel towards this crappy product or even crappier company (Pinnacle) suffice to say that I will never own a Pinnacle product ever again. Do yourselves a favor - pay the extra mony and get Sony Vegas. This is one of the worst software products I have ever had the misfortune to pay money for - and an even worse company supporting it. Rude, arrogant and careless. Don't touch this product or ANYTHING Pinncle happens to 'produce'."
1,Studio 9 from Pinnacle System,I've received the product....but it had to be upgrade for better results.....and it's not possible. On the phone they told me it's no longer avalable. Pinnacle want's to make money with Studio 12.....Too Bad André Marcoux 23 l'assomption Repentigny Qc Can J6A 1A3
1,Horrible,Received Product as described but whenever i try to work within the software it always shuts down unexpectedly without saving. this product is a waste of time and money. DO NOT GET IT
2,Worse than a temperamental racehorse!,"This is stunning software and I have wowed my family and friends with true movies that don't bore them. But this is only WHEN it works! It bombs out, needs patches all over its body and unless you disable everything and install software on separate drive, it winds down to nothing. Studio also lies - they recommend Althlon processor, but anyone who has worked with this says it needs Intel and nothing else! Thanks. Its favourite trick is to edit, save, burn dvd movies, and then refuse to make movie once a fresh edit has been completed. I've tried 25 times with three different movies. No go! Bought Ver 10 - thought this will sort it out. Loaded it - would not recognise previously made movies (came up in strange colours) and then told me to fetch a patch! Imagine buying a new car and then being phoned by the garage to say come in because the car needs to be patched! These software designers need to learn some manners!"
1,Most Unstable Program EVER,"This is absolutely the most unstable software I have ever experieced. I use LOTS of different software from business databases to Microsoft Office to all the professional Adobe products and have NEVER experienced the crashes (still ongoing) that I have with this program. Pinnacle's constant answer is turn everything else off in the task manager. Funny that Adobe Premier video doesn't need to do that or any other program I have. I defragged my hard drive and made it worse. I upgraded from 8 to 9 and still am walking on egg shells. Do you like the color BLUE as in the windows crash screen??? Use this program. By the way, this is all occuring on a new, extremely well equipped Dell."
1,Is your time valuble,Do not buy this software before checking their own forum.Things you won't be able to do1. Burn a trouble free dvd.2. Keep even audio levels even3. Output projects to tape without flawsI used studio dv and 7 but this is by far the worst.I switched to screenblast movie studio. It works first time.Hope this helps.
1,Stay Away - very far away from this product,"Where do I begin - All I wanted to do was to create a movie with 60 clips, and a title page between each clip. Nothing fancy - that's it, just 60 clips. I've been working on it for 3 months! even after the recent patch (9.4) I cannot finish the product. It keeps crashing and freezing. I have a 3.2gz machine, 1g ram, and I've defragged my harddrive - the product just does not work. I feel like I've thrown $79 out the window on this product.I've read other's reviews before purchasing Studio - and I always thought - ""It must be something with their systems - or it can't be as bad as they describe"". IT IS THAT BAD. Do not buy this product - if you do - you will be sorry.Sad part is, I've since tried other programs, and Studio is the, in my opinion, easiest to use, if it would work. If I had the money, I'd switch over to cyber media Power Director 4 as it seemed to be, in my opinion, the easiest to use out of the other programs out there."
1,Just burn the $80.,"The worst yet. I've used 7,8 and now 9, only becaused they promised a better software package. I have a new state-of-the art Sony with 200G hard drive and it still freezes. Spend your money on Sony's Screenblast, or get a Mac and use Final Cut Pro.Pinnacle really SUCKS."
1,Don't Waste your Money!!!,"The software only version is a complete waste of money! It does not support their own Dazzle products, such as DCS 200. Customer service is fast and absolutely no help. If you feel lucky, buy the software AND hardware product. Personally, I'm taking my money to Vegas. It's a safer bet!!"
2,Doesn't work with my DVD burner,Pinnacle studio 9 did a good job except that it would not do anything but waste blank after blank on my burner. Their site claims to be compatible and I did the firmware update. They were good about giving a refund since the product did not do what they said it would do.
1,The Buggiest Software Around,"Pinnacle makes some of the buggiest software in the business. Their Studio makes more coasters than DVDs. They should be ashamed of selling such junk to an unsuspecting public.If you stole their software, you would be fined and go to jail. If they stole your money, which they are, that is ok."
1,I do not reccommend Pinnacle Studio 9,"I have had nothing but problems. Most recently I am having a very difficult time ""rendering movie"" and in 1 year I have only burned 1 DVD successfully out of 20. I am constantly throwing the DVDs away. The recent error message states ""Burning failed during the burning process"". I DO NOT RECCOMMEND NERO!"
1,this product just plain sucks,"This program was a Christmas present from my father, who knows I am very interested in video editing.For my birthday I got a nice little pocket camcorder, I have been using this for about a year, and I was growing tired of using Windows Movie Maker, so my dad baught me this, and no lie, this program LOOKS amazing.Not only did a C++ error come up over half the times I used it, when I imported my video's from my camera, which CAPTURE did not let me do in the first place, there was no sound, and a message came up saying it was wrong or something, very frusterating.Not only that, It was EXTREMELY difficult to figure out, and I read the manual front to back, so the idiot in the first post should take another shot at guessing the problem, or maybe find a job that isn't head programmer at Pinnacle.I would give this a zero, but its only 1-5, and it deserves a-400."
1,Do you keep XP updated? Forget about buying this if you do!,"Pinnacle demands you use XP Service Pack 1 before it even installs itself. If you've been updating your XP regularly like you should, you'll be using Service Pack 2. You would think that wouldn't be a problem, but with Pinnacle it is! As stated on their customer service site, they don't ""support"" the current version. I had to DOWNGRADE my XP to use this, and I bought this off the store just today! What kind of tech company is this? I have to make my system vulnerable by using an obsolete security update just to record a video!"
1,Never made it work,"I spent several weeks trying to get this product to work and finally gave up. Technical support, as many have indicated, is a joke. It took them 12 days to respond to my first email. After that it was a response every 2 days. Basically, my system never recognized the card. Windows never popped up the New Hardware dialog, and there was nothing under device manager. I uninstalled everything and tried the install again, but no luck. I downloaded patches, and new drivers, but nothing worked. Mean while, tech support was just sending me canned answers, and not even reading my emails. If you look at the chat on pinnacles web site, there are a lot of frustrated users trying to make this product work. There is also a lot of talk about how the product does not work correctly with XP Service Pack 2."
1,Resulting MPEGs work only with Pinnacle,"The capturing from VHS worked fine. Pinnacle 9 creates MPEG files from your captures. However, the DVD creation options are -horrible-. After the captures were done, I had several MPEG files that Pinnacle had created. I sold Pinnacle (and uninstalled the software), and then bought a separate DVD authoring tool with which to create DVDs from Pinnacle's MPEG files. To my horror and then I discovered that no other tool can edit the MPEGs. Windows Media Player can -play- the MPEGs, but nothing can edit them. Not Windows Movie Maker, not Adobe Premiere Elements, not Sonic MyDVD, and not Muvee. So, I had to buy Pinnacle's software all over again, just so I could convert their (secretly encoded?) MPEGs into a format that other tools could understand: WMV.The only part of this product that is solid is the capturing video."
1,Non-stop Crashes and Freezes,"You would think Pinnacle never wrote a piece of software before, or maybe this was written by a 5th grader and never tested. There is just no excuse for a program that crashes almost every time it is used. I use the term loosely because the software is just unusable.The program frequently freezes when creating videos, crashes to the desktop when viewing videos that were made. I got into the habit of saving my project every 30 seconds because the program crashed and had to be restarted so often.This frustration culminated in the creation of more coasters than DVDs.AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
2,TOO SHORT AND LACKS QUALITY.,"Yes, this book does portray the tragic events of September 11th but compared to other books on the market, this one is very low budget and lacks quality. The horrific events are the same, no matter which publication you read, but many do a much finer job of portraying the events than this one. It is like anything else in life, we generally get what we pay for. This book is extremely short (48 pages) and lacks the dramatic photography and complete detail some of the other books contain. Compared to other books, this one was more of a ""brief summary"" as opposed to a detailed account. I would recommend ""New York September 11"" by Magnum Photographers before this one. It is an excellent portrayal of the events."
1,Merely exploitative,"Of all the books that have appeared so far on the events of 9/11, this is the only one I've seen that really comes across as a one-dimensional, cynical cash-in. The thin (48 pages) paperback features photos (most of which can be found elsewhere) with captions seemingly written for grade schoolers and little else. There is no particular point of view (other than tragic loss) and the whole thing looks like it was cobbled together in less than an hour. You'll be better satisfied with any of the other books on the market, and, in particular, ""One Nation"" featuring the photographs of Life photographers or the volume of photos by Magnum photographers."
1,Propaganda BS,"You're kidding me, right? We, the ""American"" people are going to filter our hard earned money into the pockets of those who would turn a truly tragic day into a profit-making business? I don't give a damn if they did get 'official' permission to use any and/or all of the pictures and ""heroic stories"", this is simply sick and wrong. Go ahead, buy it, and prove to the world what a 'patriot' really looks like. 0 stars, for all of you."
5,Perennial favorite for this dark time of year,"Every year, every single October, I reread this book which my parents gave to me when I was a young child. It is lyrical and evocative of the time when we were children and thought of Halloween as magical. The streets of the town as Halloween begins, the haunted house where Moundshroud lives, the ancient rituals we are led through by Bradbury, the travel through time and history, the underlying message that death will eventually come for us all -- it is ominous yet strangely comforting to read every time. It is not like his other books, but it is a must-read for all of his fans."
5,Classic,"This is one of my favorite Halloween books. Ray Bradbury takes the reader on a journey through history, all the while getting closer and closer to solving the mystery of Pip! Excellent read - perfect for older elementary school through high school"
3,Halloween tree,The product was just as described. Its an ok story just expected more from bradburry. The price was also fair
3,"Glad to have it, but wish it were better quality","The book arrived rather quickly, and that was great. I have been wanting to read this book for a while now. Was a childhood favorite... however, when I got it... after about 30 pages in, found several pages to be extremely blurry and hard to read.Some of it was almost completely unreadable. It looked as if someone had bumped the printer when printing the ink. I am disappointed that so many of the pages turned out like that, and hope the company doesn't do that with any other books."
3,kitschy fun,"I thought the plot was implausible, events contain historical errors, but the book is still a fun, short read, particularly for tweens and early adolescents. RB always leaves me wanting to read more or keep writing. There is a lot of magic in these pages."
1,Yuck!,"I really thought I would like this one, but I really had to force myself to finish it. I loved _The Martian Chronicles_, _The Illsutrated Man_, and even _Dandelion Wine_ but I really hated this. It reads like a poetic history lesson for 3rd graders. There were no big surprises, no new ideas, just halloween investigated one culture at a time by kids.Read it if your under the age of 10 when it could still be captivating or if you have no idea about the history of halloween and enjoy stories with young kids as the main characters."
5,An enchanting story!!!,"I saw the movie first, and it became a tradition to watch it on Halloween. I hope that my children will keep the tradition goin with their own children."
5,Fun haloween story!,"Ray Bradbury writes a story around Halloween.I was impressed by the story , the illustrations and the journey the kids take to find and save their friendall while learning the origins of halloween.This is a book you should save and read on Halloween."
4,Haunting,"On a race through history, 8 boys must learn the secrets and origins of Halloween night in order that they might save the life of their friend, who has been stricken ill on Halloween. Ray Bradbury weaves an imaginative story that creates a rather simplified but no less interesting history of Halloween night. With his usual imagery, Bradbury really creates a story with eerie and sometimes scary nature that is Halloween night."
5,I love this book!,"I will be twenty-five in two months, but this book brings the kid and adventure out in me everytime I read it -- which is every October. If you want to have a fun read and make your kids into readers, pick up this book!"
5,"Insightful, a necessary reading","It really takes you there. Very insightful and complete. Also, for those who like to know how things developed this book is a gem. I still use Symon's book for my general mechanics class, but Lanczos is absolutely necessary reading."
5,Lucid and elegant -- a true classic,"Lanczos' book is a compelling analysis of the principles of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics. It reminds me a bit of Feyman's Lectures on Physics because it focuses on the motivating principles behind advanced mechanics. In an elegant and flowing style, Lanczos guides the reader through a walking tour of the principles of mechanics, peppered with historical footnotes. If you understand how to use mechanics, but want to understand how the underlying principles are developed, this is an excellent choice."
5,So beatiful that feels like art,"Lanczos makes mechanics feels like art in this superb work. Analytical Mechanics is the foundation of physics and Lanczos has complete command of the theme. The purpose of this book is to make one understand mechanics ""from inside"" and not to stress methods of problem solving. Lanczos says that very clearly in the preface. The beauty of the book is that it's not in the same category as Goldstein, instead feelink more likely to Landau, so the bad criticism of the 2-star guy comes from someone that missed this."
3,quite disappointing,"I was disappointed with this production. Raimondi just does not have the comic nature of say Corbelli on the SD release nor did I find the rest of the cast, with the notable exception of Juan Diego Florez, particularly memorable. The sets and costumes were too heavy and the conducting lacked the lightness this opera requires. The video and sound were technically excellent however.I found the SD release with Corbelli more enjoyable although not of course presented with such technical clarity. Perhaps it will be remastered."
5,Making Gifts With Rubber Stamps-A MUST Have!,This book is FULL of gorgeous and creative ideas! The pictures and examples are stunning and the directions easy to follow.I'm always looking for new ways to use rubber stamping in art and this book really inspired me.
1,Not Worth It!,"Having been to London twice and still not seeing it all, I bought this map after losing my trusted map. It is sturdy and easy to handle, but very confusing and not in any georaphical order. I would hate to be a lost tourist in London for the first time relying on this unreliable map."
1,Save your Money,"We bought this map because of the wonderful map they had for Paris. This map was terrible. It did not have many of the smaller streets. Do yourself a favor, by a ""Time Out"" guidebook for London. Their map was excellent; as it should be Time Out is headquartered there."
4,MAP OF LONDON,I've never been to London before. But I'm sure this book will be useful. As I think that Lonely Planet is a very good travel gride.
5,great,The product was just as described I am a contractor and the product worked fine and the customer was very happyThanks Dwight
4,I'm sure it is a good product.,I'm sure it is a good product. It didn't fit my generator. It seems to be well made. I would recommend it.
5,Absolutely Best Hair Spray,"This is a product I've been using for many years and I absolutely cannot use anything else. I have to order online because it is not available for sale in Naples, Florida where I live. It's a great product. I have allergies to scents and fragrances and do not have a problem with Framesi. I would highly recommend it and order at least 4-6 online at a time and keep it in stock."
2,Plastic pressure collar won't last,"I bought mine about a year and a half ago. Although the filters were prone to clogging, it made good espresso. Now that the warranty has expired, the plastic locking collar has failed and no longer holds pressure. It seems to me that a plastic collar is pretty much guaranteed to fail eventually. I guess that is why better machines use a metal collar. I would not recommend buying this unit or any machine with a plastic collar."
5,THIS IS A GREAT ESPRESSO MAKER,"My wife and I spend way too much at Starbucks! So, we decided to buy are own machine. We selected this one for the price and the good reviews that were left on this site. It works well and fast!! I have nothing bad to say about it. I would highly recommend it to all!!!"
3,"Overall, a disappointment after one year","A very pretty machine that makes mediocre, not-very-rich tasting coffee when it works right. After one year, it just stopped working and no longer can espress coffee, presumably because the pressure mechanism has failed.I think the warnings from other users about this machine are worth listening to.Breville ESP8XL Cafe Roma Stainless Espresso Maker"
2,Not as good as I expected,"Before purchasing the machine I had done a bit of research. The professional reviews and customer reviews I read placed this machine at the top considering the price tag. The coffee that came out was fine, but although it heated the milk, it made little froth. I also noticed that it took at least half an hour for the machine to get really hot. In fact, it got so hot that if you touched it you would burn. My third time using it, I tried to get froth by heating the milk for over 20 minutes. It didn't work. The machine stopped working. The pump just went dead. I tried to shut off the machine and turn it on and nothing. I waited about fifteen minutes and turned it on and the pump worked, but now no froth came out at all. Of course, I had cleaned the attachment well. I used a needle to clean it again. I even took it apart and replaced it. Nothing. I'm returning it. It could be that this particular unit was defective, but I'll try for a more expensive brand."
2,Good but not good enough,"The machine looks fantastic, but unfortunately looks arent everything. Makes a decent espresso but could be better. Instead of a dry steam it produces a overly wet steam. Which causes a lot of unwanted water in your milk. Pump doesnt seem strong enough and made me wonder if it wasnt going to last very long. I ended up returning this. A couple hundred dollars more will get you an exceptional home machine. I recommend any serious coffee drinkers to go that route."
2,Drinking coffee grounds,"The machine worked for a while but now no matter how much I clean the machine, grounds get in the coffee. Will buy a different brand next time."
1,Poor Quality Espresso,"Shortly after receiving my machine, I checked the temperature of the espresso that was being generated. It was 145 degrees which I consider too low. I e-mailed support at Breville and they responded with the following instructions:To prime your machine to raise the temperature to its normal setting, follow directions below:Make sure your water reservoir is at least fullTurn on your machine's powerTurn your dial from the center position to the Steam position on the left and wait 15 secondsTurn your dial back to the center Standby position for 1 secondTurn you dial from the center position to the Brew position on the right and wait 15 secondsTurn your dial back to the center Standby position for 1 secondRepeat steps 3 thru 6 seven timesreturn the dial to the center standby position.Now you are ready to make hot espresso with your Breville Espresso machine!I found this procedure unworkable and ineffective. It really soured me on the machine."
1,Heater broke after two months - company doesn't answer phone,"I bought this product new. At the time noticed that many ""reconditioned models"" was also being advertised for a reduced price (a clue that there is something wrong). Now I know why. After two months the heater stopped working. The warm-up just stayed on, but nothing happened. I called the company 1-866-BREVILLE. They put me on hold and a recording told me to leave my number. After a whole day of trying I realized there is no one home. In any event I took it back to Bed-Bath and Beyond and they gave me my money back (lucky me).Bottom line: Although it has nice shiny steel and makes good coffee you are buying an espresso machine that is made in China."
1,Broken and no parts available,Breville ESP8XL Cafe Roma Stainless Espresso MakerI purchased this machine from Amazon on 8/11/2009. It provided fair service but for the past several weeks was leaking clear water under the machine. Nelson Appliance Repair in Colorado Springs that services Breville machines diagnosed a defective water tank docking pod and requested a replacement part from Breville. They were told that this part is not available. So after 3 years of very light and so-so service I am faced replacing this machine. This time it certainly will not be one from Breville.
2,Not So Good Machine,"Breville needs to do some design work on this unit. It does produce excellent thick crema shots but the double walled filter clogs easily and is a pain to try to boil clean. The krups unit I had for 10 years prior to buying this machine worked flawlessly. I have had to unclog the double walled filter at least 5 times in under a years time already. The other thing is that the machine is noisy and vibrates so much that you have to hold the metal expresso cups in place or the vibration causes them to slide around on the all metal drip tray. Casues a big mess if you know what I mean. As for the frothing wand, in my opinion it does not do a very goods job of producing a strong steam flow. The frothing process takes forever. I would not recommend this product to another buyer. There are just to many other machines available."
3,No Froth,"Could somebody please look and tell me (or post a picture) if the steam wand has an orifice or nozzle? It could be pressed or screwed into the wand. My wand is just an open tube. You need to slip off the rubber steam baffle to see. I have the older style, (as shown in the stock Amazon picture)just purchased from a department store before Christmas.Email replies from Breville are telling me that there is just the steam wand and the large rubber steam baffle. Nothing else. I think there is another part missing.I only gave it 3 stars. It could have gotten more if I was able to get froth.No problems with clogging of filters so far-made about 15 cups of espresso."
5,Do the Java jive.,I roast my own beans and this little machine gets all the flaver out of the bean. At first I wasnt sure if I would like the presurized portafilter. It seems to work great if you get the grind rite. The steem wand preduces plenty of steem if you run it for a for a few seconds so it can build up pressure. I realy like all the stainless steel. I purchased this as a store display for a very good price. For the cost its a great value if it lasts. Customer service at Breville is good but not great.
4,Works as well as it looks,"My husband and I have owned one of these machines for just over a year now and I really like it. It's simple to use and fairly easy to clean and it makes great cappuccinos and lattes. It comes with three filters, one for a single espresso, one for two, and one for the espresso pods (which I've never used). I like this feature as it makes it easier to measure out the correct amount of grounds. The steaming wand and rubber attachment are both nice and steam milk really well and create a very nice foam. My only concern is that the wand is difficult to clean--not that this problem is specific to this machine, mind--and that could lead to bacteria being left behind which could potentially cause illness. I like to steam a pitcher of water once I'm done with the milk to help guard against this and it has the added benefit of ensuring that the wand remains unclogged."
4,Still espressing after all these years,"I bought this machine for myself in an after-Christmas sale I want to say four years ago. My first espresso machine and it took me a while (and a few YouTube videos) to get the hang of it, but my husband and I have been making a couple of espressos a day now and have had few problems. I looked it up again on Amazon because I wasn't sure they still make it and if mine fails, I WOULD buy another. A lovely, reliable cup of espresso, easy peasy frothed milk (now that I know how). Suggestions: 1) Do buy your coffee ground to an appropriate grind. Otherwise you may get superfine grinds stuck in the filter and frustrate yourself. 2) If you are having trouble getting the hang of frothing, do as I learned in the video and start with water with a drop of dish detergent to practice until you get it right. That way you don't waste the milk. 3) Keep the machine clean and don't forget to turn it off when not in use. Enjoy."
1,Worst machine ever. I'm on the 3rd replacement from Breville.,"This machine makes good coffee when it works. The espresso cups keep clogging & the pump stops working. Works better with pods. The company replaced it for me 3 times. Each version lasted exactly 2 months. I'm trowing the 3rd version away today & I'm buying another brand. For all it's worth, it looks good on the counter top. LOL"
2,I wouldn't buy another,"I bought this to replace another bad designed espresso maker a KitchenAid that I paid over a thousand dollars including tax. This started out just like the previous one,worked fine for 3 or 4 months and it became a pretty stainless steel space filler for our counter. The main problem with these is clogging filter that cant be cleaned properly. I don't think I will buy any more hi end makers."
2,Great Espresso -- short life span!,"I bought this unit about 3 years ago and have been very satisfied with the flavorful espresso it constantly produced. Had some issues with the filters clogging but solved that with using filtered water. The water reservoir level is impossible to see, so you might just as well not have it there. Some other method would be better. Now the good part... Even with doing regular descaling procedures, two weeks ago the heating element stopped working. Tried running another descale,....same result. Finally called Breville Support. There recommendation was to turn the system on for 6 hours and then run a full tank of Distilled Vinegar to clean it out. That didn't work either. They also said the the unit is no longer manufactured and there are no spare parts in their pipeline. They'll give you a 20% discount on a new unit at the $500-600 range. That's it. I can't tell you how disappointing this is. So, buyer beware!Breville ESP8XL Cafe Roma Stainless Espresso Maker"
4,second cafe roma!,"I had my first Cafe Roma for about 10 years and liked it enough that I wanted another when I replaced it. Yes, there is a bit of an off-taste in the first couple mochas, but that went away and I have a professional-tasting mocha to start each morning off! I do use whole milk and ground chocolate powder to make a rich cup. It's much lighter in weight than my 1st machine but that doesn't detract from performance. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to buy a reasonably priced home machine."
1,Poor quality or a lemon,"I purchased this machine 4 months ago, and it has been out of function already! A very poor quality. Started with the nob cannot be turn by hand, then, the steam function did not work, finally it stop working."
4,Best Homemade Espresso w/ a touch of False Advertising,"I purchased this as a christmas present for someone and was fortunate enough to have a try. It makes very luscious espresso.However after searching the box for the ""froth enhancer"" - (shown as the little black attackment to the steamer end of the machine) - we called the manufacturer, and before even talking to an associate, their pre-recorded massage stated that if calling about the froth enhancer, it's an additional piece that can be purchased separately.Well, it shows it all over the box and the manual, and never says one way or another whether it's an additional piece or an add on, which is a little misleading.Otherwise it's a great espresso maker for the price, Amazon was able to have it delivered before the expected delivery date, and at a great price."
2,Incomplete item,Package was missing a cup and saucer and a 1 cup filter. Attempted to contact seller but received no response.
1,Not for serious Espresso drinker or Caffeine adicts,"The machine construction and features are good, compared to its peers.One major problem, the machine only allow less than 2 cup of coffee ground per brewing. You can squeeze the living daylight out of the cup to get maybe 2.5 cup of coffee to get a double-shots espresso. It is a design flaw for an espresso machine.Botoom line, it looks good, but brews lousy espresso."
3,Not really stainless - potential unhealthy,"I didn't even use it when I discovered that the porta filter is made of aluminum. The hot concentrated acidic coffee exiting the so called ""stainless"" machine would be badly leached by contacting the aluminum in the porta filter. Drink at your own tastebud and health risk (alzheimer's etc)! Someone at Breville (aka accountant/bean counter type) is not in touch with the health concious public. A few more dollars put into a stainless portafilter or at least a chrome plated brass one would not have hurt the spreadsheet profit that much!"
3,Great machine for the money...didn't last for me :(,"I love making my own cappaccino, and this machine works great. My fiance'.. now wife got me this machine a year and a half ago for Christmas. I'm very picky and this machine looks good and works well. You can make a lot of espresso in a fairly short amount of time. I have two complaints. The first is that the frothing wand is so low I always spill the milk when I am done frothing, because I have to tilt it so much. My other complaint is that the heating element broke after a year and a few months, and I really only used it a couple times a week (mostly Saturday mornings). I now have gone a few months with no espresso machine at all, but I don't think I want to buy another one of these Breville machines since its lifespan was so short for me."
2,Water reservoir contains BPA,This review is simply a warning that the water reservoir in this unit is #7 plastic (polycarbonate) and contains the toxin bisphenol A. Breville needs to keep up with the latest health info and offer a BPA-free plastic or stainless steel water reservoir.
1,Terrible,I used this machine for six months with some inconsistencies on the quality of the shots produced but overall it was ok. Then I started having problems with the filters getting clogged and tried all possible solutions I got from other customers and Breville with no luck.With disappointment I got a replacement unit and guess what?? Not a single shot of espresso... got clogged with the first shot!!!I just got tired of it and realize that if you want to get a good espresso without going to the hassle of all this you need to put more money down and get a different brand.
3,First use observations,"Two things. First, the machine vibrated so much on my kitchen counter that I had to hold the coffee cup in place in order to catch the drip. Second, it takes a really long time to heat-up/steam the milk."
2,Wimpy and temperamental machine,"I've owned 2 Capresso machines in the past, so this review is colored by my experience with Capresso machines. The first cup of espresso was wonderful...though not very hot. The steamer is a JOKE. It takes a very long time to froth a little milk and get it good and hot. The Capresso machines had much more powerful steamers. On this thing, it just kind of dribbles out.After the first cup, I really had to fool around with the grind and tamping to get any espresso to come out at all, which was never a problem on the other machines. And the warming tray...what a joke. At this point, I'm getting better at using the machine and it's making decent espresso and cappucino. But next time, I'd pay a little more money and go with a Capresso."
1,This machine doesn't froth,"I've been making cappachino's for over 30 years with machines in this price range. I couldn't froth the milk with this particular machine and sent it back. I might have just gotten a lemon. But, if not, I hope this saves you the same trouble. The Gaggia machines and the Villa Ware machines work for me."
2,"Good, but slow frothing and hard to clean",I just got this machine and it makes great espresso quickly and is not fussy about the grind. My only complaint is that it takes too long (for me) to steam the milk (3 minutes to get 170 degrees) My steamer tube did not come with the frother (new design I guess) and the milk sticks to it like CEMENT. This is even if I clean it immediately. I am returning it.
5,Great Little Machine,"I bought mine mine two weeks ago in South Africa for the equivalent of $192. I have several small espresso machines, having been weaned on espresso. What a great machine. The pump is powerful and it heats both the water and the cups very well.I am very impressed the metalic finish as it seems durable and should keep it's look for a long time. I think the bottom of the drip tray, which is plastic, could have been made of metal as well for the sake of durability.However, I could well be accused of nit-picking as nobody else has complained."
5,A bargain!,"This the best espresso machine I have owned - I have tried Krups and deLonghi machines and this beats them by a long stretch. Have used it almost every day for 8 months and it is flawless - a real workhorse. i served a latte to a friend who worked at Starbucks and he was amazed and sorry he recommended a much more expensive one to his girlfriend's parents. I have given these as gifts to my kids as well and they are delighted. Get yourself an ISI cream whipper and your mornng mocha is complete and sooo much cheaper than ""the bucks"""
3,A solution for the clogged filter epidemic,"I've had the same issues with my machine, the clogged filter situation, and after trying nearly everything suggested, I found the best solution thus far. I put the filter on my stove top, directly on a burner, and turned it up to high. I could literally hear the coffee burning away inside. Afterwards I simply let it cool, washed off the bottom, and it worked perfectly. It's happened a few times since, and each time this method worked. The metal can withstand the heat, so give it a shot!"
3,Ok but ....,"Somewhat ok, but the coffee and the milk never warms enough, it would be nice if a regular size cup would fit under the pod unstead of the two metal cups eliminating an unnecessary step and a mess, and the machine vibrates so bad you have to hold the cups in place while filling or they will vibrate away leaving the coffee to pour all over everything if you are not looking. Would be nicer if it could make a bigger cup of coffee instead of having to make two back to back, milk frothing wand could be longer allowing you to keep it in the milk frothing longer in an attempt to make it hotter but if you keep it in too long it frothes over the sides. But, a nice looking maker."
1,How Disappointing and right before Christmas,"I purchased this product as a birthday present for my partner and now after only 1 1/2 months, it does not work and has to be returned for replacement. I was very disappointed with its reliability although when it did work, it did it's job. Apparently the boiler ceased working. I do not recommend this product as far as the experience of it's reliability is concerned."
2,It Is What It Is,"I bought mine several months ago and use it exclusively for espresso. That I would give it 4 stars. As for customer service, all they have voice mail telling you they will call you back but they never do. For that I give them one star."
1,not so great,This item is not that bad. I just had a time with the warming tray. It took for ever to get warm enough to do any good. I returned the item. Had some other issues also.
2,"Messy, does not work well with pods","After several Briels we got this one, mostly because it was the least expensive brushed metal espesso machine. It was brushed metal allright. It also dripped more than any other espresso machine I owned or seen up close. After you make a shot the consistensy of the grind is that of a mud - clean-up and readying for the next shot was quite tedious. Quality of espesso with ground coffee was passable, but performance with pods (from Kimbo and Segafredo to Lucaffe and Lavazza) was abismal - poor and inconsistent. At work I use pods almost exclusively (in a Briel) and find them indispensable whenever speed and easy clean-up are important. If you plan on using pods stay away from this model. Yeah, the cup-warming tray is slow but that's the least of the problems with this design. Overall it's a nice-but-dull looking/constantly dripping machine - sorta an Amish girl with allergies of espresso makers. Returned it and got a Francis, just for the looks."
4,love this machine,"I had a very old machine (a Salton), then tried a couple other briels and finally found this machine. It works excellent. I drink mostly lattes and have no problems with the brewing or the frothing. The machine is a beauty and the drinks taste better than the coffee houses I just visited in Paris. The controls are simple too and the new models do take the pods."
4,Great unit,"I researched for hours various makers. Decided on this one with no regrets. It makes great expresso, caps, and latte's. The quality of the machine is great! It's good looking, sturdy and solid...it even includes additional pieces like the stainless milk frother cup and cups/saucers. It's fairly easy to clean...except for the frother, it can be a bit of a pain. I usually soak it in some water before tackling it right away. (But you would have that problem no matter which one you buy.) It takes a few times before you make the perfect cup but actually it's pretty easy to figure out. If you're looking for a great product at a great price I highly recommend you buy this one. I checked a lot of them out, felt this one was a good option for what I was looking for and hoped for the best when I ordered it. (cause it's not exactly cheap!) I ended up with a gem and believe this one certainly will not disappoint you either."
4,Should have spent a little more,"I've owned this espresso machine for about 4 months and use it on a daily basis. It does an adequate job, but I have found myself wishing that I had spent a little more for a slightly better machine. There are certain things that I don't care for such as the grounds being a wet sloppy mess when I remove the brew basket to empty it instead of a hard dry easily disposable ""cake"". The frothing wand takes a long time to froth the milk also, but as I already said, it does an adequate job, and given the amount that I paid I can say that I don't feel ripped off at all."
5,Excellent Product,"I gave this espresso machine to my husband last Christmas.He loves it.We have used it several times a day for almost a year with not one problem.It makes excellent espresso with great crema every time.Due to our veryhard water,we use bottled water for our coffee.We highly reccomend this product."
2,Cafe Roma Not worth the Bucks,"I bought my Cafe Roma almost four months ago and it has given average performance, at best. The crema is good but the heating element is quite pathetic. It has taken forever to heat the water just to steam and today the heating is completely kaput, I can't make espresso or steam. Waiting to hear back from the company. This machine is NOT worth the close to $200 I paid. Save your money and get something cheaper that will at least last a year, my cheapo De Longi (sp) lasted about five years."
4,Owner for two years,"There are reviews on here bemoaning the inadequate filter and the impossibility of cleaning the tiny holes of the clogged filters. The problems is not the filter, it is the grind of coffee these reviewers are using.Make sure you buy coffee that is not ground too fine and you will have no problems. I have had my machine, use it 5 times a day, and it has made great espresso every time (I have never steamed milk with it.) Do not think you can grind your own espresso with a $15 Mr Coffee blade grinder machine, you can't. Use that home grind stuff and you'll muck up the filters.I accidentally wrote a review for the Cafe Modena, and accidentally bought one for the office - oww, big mistake. the cheaper Modena is a pile of junk, coffee barely trickles out, looks like it was built by a band of blind monkeys."
3,"It works good, but doesn't last long.","This unit actually makes very good espresso with decent frothing ability. What WASN'T great was the longevity of the unit. I went through three units in five years. On every one the heating element gave out. I just tossed my latest one and ordered a much less expensive unit. If it makes good espresso and lasts a year, I'd still be better off than buying this Breville unit again."
5,great,This is an excellent product. I love it. The shipper shipped on time and it was received in great shape.Vern
4,good maker......but how to get good frothing milk,"I bought this maker last week. This maker is good for making espresso. This maker has a upgrade wand that without frothing enhancer. But I cannot get the good frothing milk. When I pour the frothing milk into the espresso, I cannot get the perfect latte because the milk is very thin. How can I solve this problem........."
2,Was 4 stars now 2,"This machine worked great for 3 months. Now I have issues with steaming milk. The froth is not rich and the latte is watery. No reponse from Breville website or on phone, the customer service is quite bad.I cleaned the steam wand and decalcified but neither of them helped. I wonder if this will get fixed. I still see steam coming but for for some reason the the latte is watery and i definetly cannot do a cappuchino with the froth i have now."
5,One of the best on the subject,"Frasier's book is one of the best I've read on the subject of asset protection. What separates this book from the others is the way Frasier approaches each technique as though it will be challenged in court. In theory, there are dozens of ways to protect assets, but in reality many of these simply don't hold up under scrutiny due to either their complexity or changes in case law which have eroded their protections. Frasier tells it like it is."
4,Great autobiography of the great man's son.,I thought it was a very good book and gave a wonderful perspective of what it must have been like growing up in the shadow of the rich and famous.
5,Every American should read this book,"At a time when national leadership is scarce, trust is shallow, and American liberties are threatened by our own government, Dr. King's words again call for our active and essential advancement of freedom and goodness. Read each entry, and when the spirit moves you read your favorite passages aloud. Dr. King and his teachings embody and continue to celebrate the most noble and vital aspects of the real American Spirit."
3,"Good ideas, but overly redundant","Dr. King had some great ideas. Aggregating them into one text is a sizable task. But the writings included here are overly redundant. Literally, many of them have exact wording from others. I know that Dr. King had lots of speaking engagements and wrote for many different publications. So I understand why he would borrow from his own words in other works. But why include writings with the same message, sometimes in the exact same words, in a book of *essential* readings?Also, the works are organized by general topic or philosophy, while a better way would be to group them chronologically to show how Dr. King's thinking changed, and how specific external events and responses influenced his thoughts and writings/speeches.So even though I want to love anything about MLK Jr., this compendium could be greatly improved by reducing it to only include the *actual* essential writings and speeches, the expressions that truly synthesize and detail King's thoughts."
4,"Great arrival time of product, and great product.","It came on time, it seems to be a good read. I'm pleased.I look forward to sitting down to this book."
5,Snakehead Rocks,May has done the best again. Snakehead made my day--I could not put it down. May surprised me with the unexpected turns.
3,Something's missing,"I didn't buy this at first because I was of the impression that it was a compilation of water episodes from the other DVDs. We own most, if not all, of the other DVDs and I can't say that I've seen any of the episodes before. They may have been shown on TV, or may have been on the earlier VHS tapes, but nevertheless they were all new to me.This one is very short at five episodes, not the length of the usual Kipper value packs, and the biggest problem is that Pig and Arnold are missing. Gotta have those pigs!The five episodes are imaginative as usual, including a talking magic frog and an elephant, plus Kipper does a great Gene Kelly/Mary Poppins impression on an umbrella adventure.Not the best Kipper to start with, but reasonable entertainment for seasoned veterans.Amanda Richards January 30, 2005"
1,Very Disappointing!,Our family has all of the Kipper videos and we have always loved them. We were excited to see a new edition but were very disappointed upon reciept when we realized that all but 1 of the stories on this DVD was on previous DVD's. If they are going to do a compilation DVD it should be advertised as such. We felt very cheated since for the money we paid we only got one new episode.
2,Not happy with this particular Kipper DVD,"We have all the Kipper movies and this one is disappointing. First of all, it's full price for only 5 stories compared to the usual 7 or 8, Secondly, Pig and Arnold aren't on any of the stories. If this was the first Kipper DVD for us to see, I wouldn't buy any more. Fortunately we have the others and they're pretty good."
3,careful,"It had to be Demi. She excels at retelling ancient folk tales, legends, biographies, and religious stories in artwork that evokes the traditions of the folk, as it were.This book is a little wordy for children, it seems geared more for home display. The artwork is beautiful -- tons of gold and lots of action. Enjoy!"
5,Nice Ring,The ring was very nice. Good quality for a fair price. I liked the detailing on the side of the ring with the trinity on both sides of the ring. You'll like this product!
4,Fun accessory; easy to assemble.,"This was purchased as an accessory to war games played my boys and their friends. One of them assembled it by himself and has had fun using it. Because it is not intended to be assembled over and over again, the boys use their imaginations in their games, which works just fine. It is also suited for model set-ups, i.e. trains, displays, etc. that are not being used to play with, but only for viewing. Either way, it serves its purpose."
4,Rugged and Durable,I've owned this phone set for 3 years and it's been great! The range on the handsets in very good - about 60 feet from the house. The batteries are just now starting to fade. Good investment!
3,"Ok, but bad battery","A major concern for most homeowners is the battery for cordless phones. After a while, the 'memory' on the battery causes it not to be able to be recharged. I have had my phone system now for a couple years and took the phone off the charger (which has been there for about 24 hours) and placed a single call. No more than 10 seconds into the call, the phone is 'low battery'.I will no longer by phones with the Nickle Metal Hidride batteries. They are consistently causing problems.Other than the battery, this phone system was fantastic. No sound problems, had all the features I wanted."
1,worst product with worst supprot from worst company,uniden CLX475-3 does not support the new daylight saving time. I contact uniden support and the solution I got from them is to manually change the time. I can't believe this is their solution.
4,the ring is true to the picture,"A fantastic buy. I love the ring and would have given ita 5 except that a little of the black background seemsto be coming off, granted, this is minor. I would buy itagain and also I would recommend it to anybody. Thisring is very true to the picture of it that is displayed."
2,I was a NuVinyl fan...,"it seems that the formula has changed significantly since the last time i used it. even after scrubbing my plastic trim and applying the product, the ""protection"" didn't last after it rained a few lays later..."
1,An incomplete and uninformative book of dreams,"I am no expert on dreams and knowing what they mean. I have no professional experience in this sphere of work. I can't even remember reading another book on dreams. But this book is grossly incomplete and total rubbish.In theory the book is what I was looking for - an alphabetical list of key words with and ""explanation"" of what the word means in a dream. However the list of key words is woefully incomplete to the point where it took me half a dozen or more searches to find any word I may have dreamed about. No mention of water, sea, ocean, mother, falling, gold, death. Again, I'm no expert but aren't these rather common dreams?Secondly the explanations of the words read more like horoscopes than insights into the subconscious. In flicking through the book, I found the description of ""vagina"" starts with ""What a lovely word!"" and it goes downhill from there.Please don't waste your money."
4,C250 Headset,"The item is made cheap, I have gone thru two already. But I must say the sound quality is the best of any headset I have used with my cell phone. So just be careful, as the ear rubber curve piece can break. Do not bend it and it may last a while."
3,"Good, but...","Overall, this book is an enjoyable read. The information in it is useful for helping learn how to conduct a patient encounter and how to look at patients as a whole (applying the biopsychosocial model) as opposed to a single set of symptoms or a disease. For its reminder that medicine is not purely science and that the humanities are essential to making a good physician, this book deserves a lot of credit and praise.Nevertheless, the glaringly awful typos found in every single chapter make me question whether this book had an editor or proofreader before it was put to press. I downgraded the book from 4 to 3 stars because of the haphazard presentation.Again, a good read (and even better if you're not grammar-obsessed like I am). :)"
1,Barely readable.,Littered with spelling mistakes and everything is horribly formatted. Biggest waste of 40 for a kindle book. If I didn't need it in a certain amount of time I would have never purchased.
4,"Valuable book, but...","I purchased this book for a clinical course. The content of the book is actually pretty engaging and relevant for clinicians who truly value the WHOLE patient. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are:1. The pages easily come out of the spine. This is the only textbook that I've had this issue with to this degree. Perhaps I just got a dud copy, or else the publisher needs to find a new printing company.2. There's no online version available. Most textbooks now come with login codes to read the text online. The value of this text would be greater if buyers had that option."
2,MS.T,I THOUGHT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THIS BOOK. I COULD HAVE DID WITHOUT THE BOOK ALTHOUGH THE L WORD SEREIS WAS VERY GOOD.
4,Great handbook to take with you to meet celebrities.,"This was a great reference book to take with me on my celebrity encounters. You have some great pictures of you and celebrities. I think the pictures tell all. I will use the book as a guide the next time out. THANKS !!! I would like to know is, what did you really say to the president."

1,What a let down...,"I put this item on my wishlist for Christmas after reading such good reviews and I was super excited when I got one as a gift. After trying to set the time several times (3 different people tried multiple times), we decided it was defective. The instructions say to hold ""set"" for 2 seconds until it beeps and after pushing set, nothing happened. No beep, no flashing numbers. All of the other buttons work except for that one. That created a new problem... when I would push the other buttons to see if THEY worked, any time I push ""set"" it would just start or stop the stop watch/timer and I was unable to get back to the clock to try and set the time again. There's no reason to have a watch that you can't even set the time on. I hope no one else has this problem... it is very frustrating."
5,Great Watch!,"Bought this as a Gift, She loves it, Uses it for Spin Class, I love it cause it got her back in the gym...Thanks"
5,great watch!!,"I found this watch to be amazing!! It works great, I get readings whether I'm running for the bus, or powering through my workouts. I love the color. Its fairly easy to figure out, but I have had to refer to the guide once or twice. I don't like how big it is. Its kinda clunky. I guess you can't expect a heart rate monitor to look like a Fossil watch. I use it to make sure I stay in that 60-80% zone and its fabulous for that. I wear it also for the digital clock and the timer is nice too. I've only had trouble getting a reading once or twice, no big deal since I've used it at least 100 times. It came with the black strap which will come in handy for a little aesthetic change of pace. Great watch!! Highly recommend for a convenient, easy to use, reliable, affordable heart rate monitor watch!"
1,don't waste your money,"This watch worked only sporadically for me, and not at all if my wrist was moist from sweat. All it did was make me frustrated. Don't waste your money."
3,Not too bad of a heart rate monitor,"This heart rate monitor watch is very convenient if you don't want to be wearing a chest strap. However, it is not as accurate as one with a chest strap that will take your heart rate as you are working out."
2,Does not work for a Left handed person,"I'm not a small framed girl and this watch was extremely bulky on me. Even quite pain full when exercising, for it has to be snug to get a reading -if you could even get it to do a heart rate check. Not to mention the fact that it is not user friendly for a ""Left-y."" Then if using this heart rate monitor for exercise purposes it does not get a reading (regardless of placement on right/left wrist above wrist bone) once one ""breaks a sweat"" which seam to defeat the purpose in my mind. Over all I was very dissatisfied w/ the quality of this watch."
1,Not What I Expected,"Don't buy this if your intention is to keep track of calories burned while swimming or doing water aerobics or other wet exercise. Even though this watch/heart rate monitor is advertised as being ""water resistant"" -- the heart rate monitor does not work if it is wet, or if your fingers are wet. Mine gives totally wacky reading for my heart rate if I'm swimming. Sometimes, if I take the time to dry off my fingers and the buttons, I can get a reasonably accurate reading for my heart rate, but by then, my heart rate has returned to it's resting level which, isn't the number I'm interested in obtaining. Monitor seems to work fine if it's totally dry, but I usually get my exercise by swimming. I think it was a waste of money for me."
3,beware!,"It is a great game, i used to play it on my PC. Now i realized that it has some problems with NVidia Graphic cards 7xxx series or later.If you have an ATI card, no problem at all.Keep in mind before buying this one."
3,"Love them, but poorly made","I originally bought these shoes a year ago and had to return them because the strap broke after only wearing them a few times. I really love the shoes, so I decided to give them another try when I found them on sale...after only wearing them 3 times, the strap broke again. The shoes are so cute and go with everything, but they are very poorly made."
3,Good looks and screen,"I bought this phone in exchange of my sanyo 8400.There are few drawbacks.I am switching back to sanyo.Pros:1.Looks are very good.2.The screen has very high resolution.Images are crisp and sharp.3.The camera fun features are nice.4.Media player is good.Cons:1.YOU CANNOT TRANSFER MUSIC TO YOUR PHONE WITHOUT BUYING A CARD READER/WRITER.Buy a card reader/writer for 10$ more.2.The phone cannot be hooked to your PC except for going online.Which means ,except for the modem functionality your PC will not identify your phone nor can you do the data transfer between your phone and your PC.Yuk.3.Reception is average.This phone does not have signal where my other phone had signal."
3,"All good, but if you don't charge the battery ....","I have this phone for almost a month now. The phone looks great, has this small trans memory card that you can use to load music into it, and to transfer the pictures you took to your computer. Most of the things are nice - the display is crisp, the ring is loud. It takes good pictures considering that its just a phone.However the biggest drawback is the battery. It simply does not last a day. And if you talk as much as I do on the phone, this is definitely not the phone for you.Update: The battery is really crappy. It has died so many times on me. I hate this phone and wish I had never gotten it."
5,Great phone,This is really a remarkable phone from Samsung and Sprint. Does everything it advertises perfectly and the GUI is absolutly excellent and is the main reason I gave it 5 stars. I would recommend you to get a 1GB MicroSD to store your media to play on this phone.
5,great product at a great price,"I have found that I need to replace my Treo 600 battery every 1-1/2 to 2 years, which is equivalent to the 500 or so charges that a lithium battery can take. The symptoms of a dying battery in this smartphone are:a) dropping cell phone calls as soon as they connectb) rapidly falling charge level throughout the dayc) incorrect signal strength readings - simultaneously displaying ""no signal"" while showing 4 bars.This battery has built-in overcharge protection (very important), installed easily, and came at a great price.The only thing it lacked were any instructions for how to disassemble the phone and install the battery, but I didn't need them since I had done it before."
1,sterling silver Scottish dukes garnet armor ring,This is a beautiful ring but the stone fell out within 6 months of having it & the silver is light weight. Buyer beware!
4,So Impossible EP,"This cd is a refreshing change from Chris' many songs dealing with heartbreak and sadness. There is an air of youth in that he dwells on possibilites of love and, subsequently happiness. For those of you who didn't like his 2nd album, I would say it embodies the originality of Swiss Army Romance while adding an aspect of contentment in his place in life without the catchy-pop label The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most was (unfairly) given."
4,"My First Dashboard CD, But Not My Last!","Wow! My friends told me Dashboard was good, so I went and picked up this CD. It is expenisve for just 4 songs, but its worth not having to keep skipping tracks you don't like.For You To Notice-5/5, excellent. a little slow at the beginning but it doesn't bother me!So Impossible-5/5,a masterpiece. This song blows me away!Its more upbeat than the 1st track, which makes it all the better.Remember to Breathe-4/5-good, but not great. His voice isn't as good in this song, but the rythym and lyrics are good.Hands Down-5/5, one of my all-time favorite songs. Simply amazing. Don't take my word for it, listen yourself!Overall it is an amazing CD! this won't be the last I get from DC. I would give it 5 stars if it was cheaper."
5,short but sweet,"This may only have 4 songs but they are just stellar, from the first chord to the last. So Impossible is the best song they have ever made, followed by Hands Down, and they both are on this cd. It may be a little more than what u would pay for only 4 songs but this cd is a must have for everyone not just the emos out there regardless of the price. regardless if you listen for the beat, or for the lyrics anything that involves Chris is going to leave you estatic."
2,Another whiny emo album,"The fact that this was a solo project was the only redeeming quality of Dashboard. The album was one whiny and sorry group of heartbroken love songs. I almost feel sorry for Chris Carabba. If he gets dumped one more time he might ...(do away) himself. Aside from his obvious talent, there was no other attractive qualities in this or any of his albums. Perhaps my distaste for this album stems from my general dislike of emo in general, but I also think there is a line of how whiny emo can get."
1,DO NOT BE FOOLED,"What we have here with this band/artist is the recent ""emo"" craze preying on the sappy emotions of our society's troubled youth with what seems to be ""deep and emotional"" songs. This music is not very good. What seems like catchy and creative guitar rifts is really a feminine man raping his guitar by strumming it too hard. All of his songs are about love lost in a cold autumn/winter/November. If you have a lot of unchecked emotions and want to pool your self-loathing and depression, than by all means give in and by this horrible record and dye your hair black, but if you want self-respect, look much further than Dashboard Confessionals."
2,OOOH Please!,"Chris Carabba is closer to 30 than he is 13. Why then is he still writing these whiney songs as if he were some broken-hearted outcasted preteen who just can't seem to make that certain someone to understand that he is the one, he is the swell guy she should be with. Don't get me wrong, it works, he has a great vocal style and works really well with his guitar, but like all emo records (with the exception of Death Cab for Cutie) the music is fun until you actually recognize what they are saying, then you just feel sorry and sort of embarrassed for him. Chris, buck up man, write some songs about Saturdays in the park or Walking a dog or something and forget about your preteen romances. You make a living playing music for living instead of working behind a desk or in construction, you should be giggeling like a drunk college co-ed, let's see some happiness and some better vocals. Give Ben Gibbard a call, he could help you out."
5,this ep shows the true dashboard,"In So impossible you hear nitty gritty side of dashboard that comes off so well. Unlike their newer releases, this Ep shows the heart of carrabas. And the true legnths of which his voice can achieve."
4,"Dashboard Confessional ""So Impossible [EP]""","""For You To Notice..."" (5/5): The opening track, and a good one.""So Impossible"" (4/5): This album is the only place you can find a studio version of this song. It's not bad at all, but the live version is much better.""Remember To Breathe"" (5/5): This song is one of my favorite Dashboard tracks ever. A real gem.""Hands Down"" (5/5): This song is simply amazing. Everyone alive can relate to the lyrics of this song. I can't say enough about this song.Dashboard Confessional's four track EP, ""So Impossible,"" is great. Though it is only four songs, they are all worth the money. None of the songs can be found in the same format any where else besides this album. This is a keeper and every Dashboard fan should own it.Rating: Four and a half stars."
4,If You Can Talk the Talk then You Can Pray the Walk,"The author has written a great book on the ministry of praying while you walk. It is a great form of exercise for the mind and the spirit. She spends time on both sides of the topic including helpful information on walking as an exercise and also on growing your life of prayer. Even if you are unable to walk, the sections on prayer are very helpful and informative. The book includes a 30 day challenge to get you started, along with a Bible study and suggestions for covering a community prayer walk. The author covers the subject thoroughly and with interest to the reader. The book is written to address women and issues that we face in our lives of prayer. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to expand their prayer life and willing to take on a new physical challenge at the same time."
4,Prayer Walk review,"I haven't finished this book as yet,but what I have read so far is OK. I feel this book is better suited for some one who is just getting to know Christ and is young in their faith. I all ready know many of the christian principles presented in this book and apply them to my daily life so for me this book is valuable as review and affirmation. For a young christian however this would a treasure trove of biblical principles and faith."
4,PrayerWalk,"This book isn't only informative but inspirational and motivational as well. When I picked up this book I wasn't even sure what Prayerwalking was. But the author quickly explains that its just praying and walking, combining two things that many of us need to do but often neglect because of our busy lifestyles.The author not only shares her personal story, allowing us to see how prayerwalking helped change her life but she also shares useful information on how to get started. There is a study guide and a thirty day challenge included. A must have book for anyone who wants some great ideas on shaping up physically as well as spiritually!A complimentary copy of this book was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
4,On her journey...,"On her journey, she found an answer to her depression. She found a closer relationship to God and peace with herself. She found the better health that she was seeking and learned to say no, which is one of the hardest things for anyone to learn. Even for those who aren't terribly religious, this is a wonderful book of personal triumph and finding peace within yourself.VirginiaReviewer for Coffee Time Romance and More"
2,Not worth the money,"This book is too elementary to teach you anything. The dialogues may give you a sample of the kind of things you may need to say, but there is no real help with the language itself. There does not appear to be a plan behind the dialogues. I gave up and bought Elisabeth Smiths Instant Portuguese which is much more helpful. You can tell there is a plan in this one. You feel more confident you are in the hands of a good teaching tool."
1,disappointment,"The book begins by referencing an audio tape (series) that does NOT come with this offering of the book. Clearly, the audio is VERY important to pick up even the most basic of languages."
2,Riddled with mistakes,"I realised the more I studied this book the more I understood why it was so difficult to get the answers right when doing the exercises. It is riddled with mistakes. Even at the outset with simple greetings such as ""How are you?"" ""I am well"" , the answers to exercises have a woman using the masculine form (Exercise 1, Unit 1) and gives ""Are you well?"" to a man as ..estas 'bom' instead of the usual 'bem' without any explanation (box on page 15). In a table of personal pronouns, the feminine singular is given as a plural (elas instead of ela) Unit 2 p. 21 and in the same Unit a table of nationalities has transposed the feminine singular and masculine plural. And so it goes on. I thought it had been produced in a hurry but yet it appears to have had three editions since 1996. This company describes itself as loved and trusted - well it shouldn't abuse that trust. And can anybody recommend a good introductory book on European Portuguese?"
3,Textbook to learn Portuguese,"The book is very good and gives a basic introduction to the language. It references a tape series which would be very helpful, especially for learning some of the more difficult sounds."
5,"great concept, easy explanations","I had one book of recipes of cordon bleu at home. The recipes are good, but what I loved from it was the techniques section.This book is a techniques book which go farther in preparations for any kind of food... Must have if you are a low-medium level home cook who likes cooking but has not received lessons on how professionaly chop an onion, etc. You will get plenty of pages on basic techniques no one had talked to you about!Like everything in life, if you master the basic fundamentals you will be good in something. Surprisingly, there are not many books that are deep dealing with the basics of things. This is one of rare exceptions who contains enough knowledge to talk a wise lot on the important things."
3,Not for begginers nor for experts,"I have a love-hate relationship with this book. I think it is good that I have it but I really only started understanding it after taking serious cooking classes in a local technical institute. The book does not really tell you enough to learn from scratch but it does go breezely through the fundamentals. All in all, it is relatively comprehensive and it does give you ideas to become a better cook, but it does not hold on its own as a main cooking reference.One thing I like from the book is the emphasis they make on dish presentation. I always consult it whan I am trying to figure out how to serve something.In summary, I think Cordon Bleu can really get down to finish this as it can be a great product but they need to make it more explanatory and comprehensive."
4,Good Introduction,"This is a good introductory book for beginners only. More experienced cooks will be impatient with the amount of space given to very basic techniques, like how to julienne vegetables, etc. The book is very nicely illustrated with abundant photographs."
3,Kind of fluffy.,"I was hoping for detailed knifework photos and more advanced tips and tricks. I don't really need pretty photos of ingredients and finished dishes. Also, not as comprehensive as it could have been... maybe choosing a single cuisine would help, instead of the broad multiculturalism shown here. More of a coffee table book than a highly practical guide to culinary techniques."
5,Le Cordon Bleu Techniques cookbook,I purchased this book as an Easter basket filler for my 14 year old son..as he is showing an interest in becoming a chef. The book has tons of photos and culinary techniques that he can study and practice on as he enters high school this fall. A great book for anyone that enjoys cooking or wants to learn much more.
5,Great book!,"I bought this book for my brother who's studying to be a chef. It's a great book to have, even for people like me that has no experience cooking. What I like the most, the illustrations! Nothing like having a cooking book with plenty of pictures showing you the instructions on how to do stuff."
5,An excellent reference,"If you really want to learn to cook, this is perhaps the best cooking technique book there is. The instructions are clear, the photos are useful and this book covers a lot of topics. Strongly recommended. It also makes great gift."
5,Excellent book!,This book is just amazing. Great help for those who want to master or learn the basic cooking techniques.
3,Not much substance. Disappointed.,"I ordered the book and expected its arrival with much excitement. Well, it came: big and with lots of nice photographs.Judging form the title, I expected the techniques' descriptions, a book to learn from. It doesn't deliver: instead of teaching the correct way of handling ingredients, precise cooking method descriptions, and pointing out common mistakes, it instead contains a nice slide show of a TV cooking show's stills. They cover a lot, but in minimal depth.They do have nice inserts of simple ways to dress up a dish, i.e. cutting and peeling vegetables, fruits, etc.I get that the book represents the French approach to cooking, but, jeez, who sells books with the word ""Oriental"" in it in 2012 in the US? I found it a racist book that views non-French cooking as ""unusual"", i.e. the French way of cooking eggs is the ""normal"" way, but the Mexican huevos rancheros way is ""unusual"".Alton Brown's books are lot more informative and educational."
1,no information on this book provided,"The reviews listed with this book are for other books, not this one. You missed a good chance for an order because I couldn't evaluate this book."
3,These cops like to eat!,"These cops sure do like to eat, with Deputy Sheriff Carl Houseman leading the way to the buffet. This adds a feeling of realism to this entertaining novel set in a truly godforsaken sounding part of Iowa. The plot is not full of mystery and suspense, but more of the day to day plodding and in fighting of a real sounding sheriff's operation. I came away from this novel with a feeling of knowing the characters, even the minor ones, and enjoying the little screw-ups that occurred in the course of the chase. The only annoying part of the book is the incessant use of ""cool"" by the protagonist and most of his associates. People don't really say ""cool"" all the time, do they?"
1,Procedure does not equal plot,"Thirty years ago Julian Symons wrote of police procedurals that ""A fair degree of realism is possible, but it cannot be pushed too far for fear that the book might be as dull as the actual days of a policeman."" Donald Harstad's latest is dull not necessarily because of too much procedure--I am a huge fan of procedure-- but because he and his editor have assumed that procedural realism will cover up plot weakness. The last 120 pages of the book are superfluous and little more than an extended chase for a known killer. With Hollywood offering such lucrative options on books, one can hardly blame writers for offering up stories that will appeal to film producer's literary agents. But do all readers have to suffer through pages and pages of chase scenes? Why not just ship the manuscript directly to Paramount?"
5,He Tackled the Status Quo,"Even the Presidency did not take the boy out of Theodore Roosevelt. A century ago, when Washington was a simpler place, TR engaged in such youthful sports as wintry swims in the Potomac. President Roosevelt showed similar courage in tackling financial tycoons or forcing Spain out of Cuba. TR was a significant figure on the political stage from the 1880s through World War I. He was an active, early conservationist. Betsy Kraft's well-paced, illustrated biography will engage young (and older) adults. The author brings this man and his era to life. Public libraries and high schools should find it valuable."
3,Uncomfortable grip,"I received this pound hammer a few minutes ago. The head's diameter is approx. 1 1/16th"" and it isn't totally flat; it has 5/16th inch depression that runs along the lower periphery, which is almost an inch long. I suspect that could be a problem when you strike a nail, which I haven't yet done. The grip, which resembles the treads on a tire is uncomfortable and I suspect that after handling the tool for a while, you could end up with those tire tread indentations on your hand. It doesn't match up to my old hammer, which had a similar design, but it had no uncomfortable treads and it was well forged and nicely balanced, including standing up nicely on its head; this Tekton hammer stands, but not as well. Unfortunately, someone borrowed my old hammer without my permission. So, I give the Tekton three stars because it was cheap ($8.11) and it can still be useful for hitting something or to pry a crate open with the claws."
4,what's to say its a hammer....,"It's a hammer, If that's what your looking for then this will work. It's a little heavy but it works."
2,"works, but it will break","I have had a common experience a lot of Samsung SGH105 users; I want to use a 2.5mm headset with the proprietary Samsung jack. I bought the Belkin adapter, it works fine for a month or two, until it breaks. I have now gone through two of these. It breaks because it is made poorly. If you never put it in a backpack or in your pocket, you might be OK for awhile, but it really shouldn't require such delicate care. Set your expectations up front and expect that this will work for a few months and then you will have to replace it."
3,Beautiful scerery,"The sets are real. That is the big plus in this film. But it is like watching a soap opera. Acting is somewhat stilted. Story a bit stretched so if you want beauty buy it, if you want a great film - don't."
3,simple is the key word,"I enjoyed the first 70 pages of the book. The author talked about technique, finishes, etc. I was disappointed in the the actual objects. The patterns were not full size and there were no measurments given. It was all sort of vague.Plus, I understoof Marquetry to be with the use of scroll saws and coping saws. The author never even showed these techniques.It was an interesting view, but NOT for the beginner wishing to learn the true art of marquetry. It is, indeed, ""simple."""
2,Muguet Perfume oil 1/3 oz roll on,I've picked up other oils such as this one and the aroma of lily of the valley doesn't compare well with others.
3,Good idea but ...,"I needed wireless remotes around the house to control the one satellite receiver that fed the rest of the house, but have never gotten them all to work reliably. One problem is that the battery replacement module button battery contacts are easy to dislodge and it is hard to get reliable contact with the batteries. Out of 3 units, I have only one that works reliably, and I had to epoxy the contacts in place to get that to be stable. I have not had time fix the other units. You might be luckier than I was. When it works, it works very well."
4,Fun,"Fun sign. Just as advertised. We like the retro style and all things aviation. We would buy it again. It's going up in the ""plane room""."
2,The Temptaions live in london,"I love the Temptations. I ordered that dvd because the front cover shows the original Temptations. I was so very disappointed that it was only with Otis and Melvin. I do like the Temptations with Dennis, however the dvd cover was very misleading. The back on the dvd showed a small picture of the temptations with Dennis. I believe that the customers should know that the dvd is NOT all of the originals with David Ruffin. Overall, I like the concert."
2,impression08,I think this was tricky because the only reason i ordered it was because i though david ruffin was in it like it is showing on the cover.False advertisement if you ask me! David is not in it at all!
2,D. Anderson,"I was totally disappointed with this DVD. I agree with M. Branch in that the cover photo is misleading via a snap shot of the original Temptations. There will never be another group of Temptations except the originals. The concert is just okay to me. I thought this was an old concert that included Paul, Eddie, David, Melvin and Otis. Again, I agree with M. Branch that ""the customers should know that the DVD is NOT all of the originals with David Ruffin."""
1,"Save your money on this one, folks.","Save your hard earned money folks. This group, orchestra and arrangements are disappointing. They tried, but the result is sub-par. Oh, and if you were wanting to hear the opening instrumental on 'Papa Was A Rolling Stone', forget it because it's not there - they just go straight to the vocals. 'Just My Imagination' was also lacking, nothing like the original as were the rest, actually. Be better off using this dvd for a frisbee."
5,Good learning tool and sample script reference,"This book does not cover the in-depth mechanics behind the scripting language.. Stuff most people find their eyeballs rolling around in their head while trying to read. Instead it takes the 'common man' approach and presents admin scripting in a practical, easy to implement way. I recommend this book for admins who are not very experienced with vbscript and want to be able to learn and produce workarble scripts quickly. It also comes with a CD of sample scrips, labs and a ebook copy of the book."
4,Could be better for newbies....,"I agree with some other reviewers that this is a a good book for more expert admins that want to start off right away. There are useful code examples to be productive right away.In my opinion there's a lack of detail on some important topics and important scripting aspects.But: like all professionals in the field we learned over the years to get a variety in material to do our jobs ;-)If you want some basics on scripting, error handling an so on than I would recommend ""The vbscript professional project book"" from Premier Press. It is a very good starting point for scripting, other books are completing the information about this topic.Rob Faber [CISSP, CEH, MCSE 2003]"
3,"Book is good, LABS need work","I went thru the book and thought the lessons were good. The way the book disects every script as you read it is great for beginners. Ed's technical reveiwer(s) did him a disservice by not check every lab on the CD against what he had in print. Of the 40 labs 3 do not work at all. If you cut and paste from the book text you can get 3 more to work. So 6 out of 40 labs have issues. The chapter 15 labs are broke all the way around. You need to adjust most of the labs to get them to work in your environment and there is no discussion of this in the text. For a book on scripting, the debugging was average."
2,NOT EXACTLY TALES FROM THE CRYPT,"This movie mimics the more popular ""Tales From the Crypt"" and rather poorly. These are the types of low budget productions you thought about doing in the eighth grade. The difference between the ones you did and these is marketing. The scripts are shortened versions of longer films and they appear to have been filmed in the same location.For example how bad it is: In the first episode the guys claim it is hot. There is an overcast. Todd (Tony Olivas) is out on this hot day doing his morning run by doesn't sweat. In fact he only sweats when he dreams. The special effects are few and not note worthy. The acting was pretty bad too.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
1,tales from the grave,I wish I could have given it 0 stars. This movie was so horrible. I could not even get passed the first story. This movie should not be compared to Tales from the Crypt. What is going to happen to the fate of our low budget movie industry?
1,Really Stupid Movie,Wow ........ I wish I could rate this movie a freaking negative 5 stars !!!! This movie consisted of four or five tales and all of the tales were stupid. Really bad acting and a really dumb story line for all the movies. The acting really really really sucked. It was like reading a dictionary out loud. I would not recommend this movie waste of money.
1,Buy it @ Best Buy,Best Buy has this same Entertainment Center for $249.99 and FREE SHIPPING! I wouldn't pay this outrageous shipping of $109!!! Go to bestbuy.com and get it there cheaper!
4,Wow!,"This piece is very beautiful and has a contemporary style that I love. With the lighted glass shelves it adds a great deal of interest to the piece. I recommend, however, that you do NOT attempt to try to put this thing together by yourself or even to move it by yourself because it is extremely heavy. The stability, practicality and great look is well worth it though."
1,Too Much Money!,"This particular item is very over priced! i've purchased this same item for $89.99 through staples.com and i didn't have to pay for shipping, beacuse any order over $50 is free shipping! go to staples.com and get this same item and save yourself $319.99! Thanks!"
4,For The Advanced Handloader,"This is the best handloading book I've ever bought. That said it is not for beginning loaders. If you don't know the basics and have some experience loading - obviously rifle cartridges - buy another book and get that experience first. Loading for rifle and loading for handguns are mutually exclusive.Just about everything you need to know about precision loading is in this book. Although the equipment may become advanced (and it may not for decades) the concept of loading for best accuracy is here.My only complaint is, the materiel is a little wordy and drawn out. The writing could be edited to get to the point a little quicker. If you have a short attention span, you may have a problem with this. Get it anyway if you honestly want to learn to make the best loads possible."
2,Handloading for Competition Making the Target Bigger.,Zediker praises Dillion and Lee products to much and I prefer RCBS and Redding. Just a matter of opinion! He did have some things of interest but alot I already knew!
5,Alot of informatiom!,This is a book that anyone that does alot of reloading should have. It contains a wealth of information that I have not found anywhere else.
4,Very helpful guide with resources,"I agree with a few previous reviewers that if you are already very active in political and social movements, this might be a little watered down for you.However, if you are interested in becoming involved in a movement, or making even the slightest change in your environment, this is a must-read. The authors use real life examples of how young women used their own talents and resources to make a positive change. Sure, some of the examples/stories do focus on unattainable resources for most of us, but others are easily obtained by any student (such as how to start your own feminist high school elective).Either way, the authors SUCCESSFULLY show the reader how to begin thinking of your own personal talents and the resources available to you, or to those you know, in order to make a difference. It is not only informative and inspiring, but it is followed by a comprehensive resource list in the back. The resources alone are worth the price of the book."
3,Not as good as _Manifesta_,"This book is definitely written for more of a mainstream audience of say, 15-25 year olds who are primarly white and middle class. Yes, there is a sense that class and race privilege permeate the book. That said, this book does offer lots of good ideas for the budding activist.I do think that their first co-authored book _Manifesta_ was better, but again it did also have that privilege or sense that somehow NY is the center of the universe (rolling my eyes).For the record, they used to identify as 3rd wave or no wave feminists and are actually too young to really fit under the rubric of 2nd Wave Feminism."
1,Just as feminist/enlightening/intellectual as Teen Vogue!,"I am a 19 year old college student. I was assigned this text for my 3000 level women's studies course. If you have any understanding of feminist theory, patriarchy, or the world outside of hip NYC life, please stay the hell away from this book. I am enraged and disappointed. The Prologue mentions bikini waxes, thongs, and a synopsis of Legally Blonde. Seriously? This is absolute garbage. If you are looking for intellectually stimulating ideas about women in society, run far away from this text. Far, far away.On the plus side, I guess it might contain some potentially ""heartwarming"" anecdotes."
1,Misleading and trite. Grassroots feminist activism it ain't,"i felt that the publisher should recall all of these books, and re-release them under the name: ""Grassroots: Some suggestions to feel-good, girl-power efforts for the slightly guilty trust fund sect who have resources and backing and networks in place to support their own passionate pursuits and random proclivities, and who are not impeded by or concerned with the little people who do not."" As a subtitle, they can have: Hey there, Muffy! Don't give up your SUV; Make true change and get an IUD! ('cause birth control = grassroots feminist activism! lol!)"
5,Center channel speaker by Pioneer,"Excellent center channel speaker. I recently upgraded to a Dolby 6.1 receiver, and moved my existing center channel to the back channel speaker. This one sounds wonderful, good on dialogue."
4,Nice Performing Speaker for the Price,"I have no problems at all with the performance of this speaker for my home theater audio setup. Gives you all you could want and more than you would expect for the price. Only thing that stops it from getting 5 stars is the visual looks - little bigger, squarer, and boxier than I was hoping. I am still working on hiding it a little bit better to stop detracting from the beautiful large screen."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,I am so not impressed with this centre speaker. the main problem is the low output for my large room. i have to have the volume close to max to get the dialogue clearly in surround mode. the sound just doesn't carry. this is using a 5.1 (100W x5) pioneer AV receiver. the quality is also no better than what i get from my tru picture Toshiba t.v. anyway so what's the point??? luckily i have a pair of great front speakers to rescue the surround experience. i may give this away and try another brand soon. would recommend looking elsewhere really.
5,"A Great Resource for ""Dealing the Cards You've Been Dealt""","I picked up this book thinking that it was just another ""self help"" type book that might spur some inward thinking and self-analysis. Boy was I surprised! This book is for anyone who needs to deal with emotional baggage and get their thought processes back on track. The exercises at the end of each section are wonderfully therapeutic. I identified closely with a couple of the character profiles at the end. I find that I reflect on the common sense advice the book offers on a daily basis. The author's down-to-earth writing style was refreshing because it does not require the reader to spend additional time deciphering the terminology -- as many of these type of books do! I recommend it highly!"
5,Tommy White: Hot Licks & Cool Tips DVD,"This is an excellent DVD. Anyone who plays steel guitar can learn something from this DVD. All shots angles and views are clearly captured by the cameras. Tommy does an exceptional job of explaining the course. Personally, I am trying to decide which I liked the best, the instruction or the demonstration. Killer tone in his hands and in that good ole Emmons he was playing !!!"
3,Bogging down in Borneo's jungle,"There's rich imagery here. But, my god, how slow the story is. It's a yarn that was begging to be written: full of headhunters and jungle exotica in the shape of mad Englishmen truly cooking their brains in the mid-day tropical sun. I found the narrative to be somewhat disjointed and it sagged as as I stopped caring much for the principal, Barr. Maybe because I'd read about the real rajah of Sarawak - Sir Rupert Brooke and the whole epic while I taught in Sarawak's only university three years ago, I left the book feeling I hadn't learned a huge amount more than what I picked up while living across the river from the Astana in Kuching while sipping my gins and tonic while reading the Causarina Tree by Maugham."
5,Once I finished it I started over.,"This book gets off to a slow start but stay with it. Everyone I've recommended it to loved it. It is beautifully written, has an exotic locale and it is based on a true story."
1,Drowned and Defeated in Kalimantaan.,"Before I bought this book, I read the Amazon readers comments. Someone said the first 40 pages were confusing. I tried to get into this book for 90 pages and then gave up. The narrative is confusing and it's hard to keep track of the characters. When I could get a feel for where we were heading, I just kept thinking ""Who Cares?"" and ""So what?"" I tried to keep going since I had spent the money for the hardback but finally decided that my time was too valuable to invest any more of it on this read. If you're compelled to read it, at least wait for the paperback."
2,Impressive yet dull,"Godshalk's book is impressive even if we didn't know that she spent somethng like 20 years working on it. Unfortunately it is a dull read with too few moments of true excitement. This book isn't like Conrad's work in that you don't get the feeling of an overarching intelligence guiding the story. It is more of a travelogue laying out the oddness of the journey and the poor, doomed English and their Empire. Perhaps if the book had been reigned in by a tougher editor and some of the details and characters condensed it would be a more interesting work but as it is I was bored for vast passages."
2,Abandoning ship,"I picked this up again after putting it down 6 months ago--imagine my shock at not even recalling much of the 50+ pages I had already read. True, the story is lush and somewhat enrapturing in its description and setting. But I find it impossible to know Barr, much less give a hoot about his philosophies, actions and life. And, if this is a ""woman's story"" as I have read in several reviews, after 110 pages, no 3-dimentional woman character has yet surfaced. I wonder why an editor did not help Godshalk eliminate some of her dozens of extraneous characters and terms. This book is, in a word, frustrating."
4,Historical fiction is still alive and well,"This brilliant, at times almost hallucinatory novel breaks most of the rules and still succeeds wonderfully. The sense of place is the most palpable I've experienced in anything since my first encounter with the genius of Joseph Conrad so many years ago. Contrary to some of the other reviews, it is seldom difficult to know which character the author is writing about--all you have to do is pay attention. Having read this novel within a year of reading Pynchon's Mason & Dixon, DeLillo's Underworld and Banks' Cloudsplitter, I am pleased to see that American fiction in general, and historical fiction in particular, is still alive and in very good health. Now I look forward to going immediately from Godshalk's tropics to Andrea Barrett's arctic (Voyage of the Narwhale). What an exciting time to be a reader."
4,England vs. East Asia,"This novel, which at first glance seems to promise luxury and languor in the tropics, delivers its plot points in sharp, savage bursts, much as the dyaks swooped down on the English settlers after months of uneventful living (except for the jungle rot, tropical disease and delusions of imperialism). It's a compelling read, one that I will go back to, but having been introduced to maias and dyaks and Dutch naturalists by Patrick O'Brian and the lovably flawed Stephen Maturin, I felt more sure of where I was going (the short glossary is a joke). The journey through the fictional Gideon Barr's empire is misleading, heartbreaking, infuriating. Nonetheless, it's a trip full of wonder and well worth taking."
3,Easier to appreciate than to love.,"One can well appreciate the author's attention to detail and the carefulness of the research, but this book is so overloaded with characters whose roles are fleeting and hard to keep straight that this reader, at least, wished more for a list of characters than for the large glossary at the end of the book. A fascinating look at a remote, underinvestigated part of the world, the characters ultimately do not stick in the reader's mind. Anyone interested in Kalimantaan might find it profitable to look also at Birute Galdikas's very poetic Reflections of Eden."
3,Andy Griffith- A Great Family Show,"Our family really has been enjoying the Andy Griffith show and am close to owning all the DVD seasons. I purchased the Final (8th) season in January but was a bit disappointed with most episodes. It seems that Barney Fife (Don Knotts) really made this show, because without him in this season there is a sense of incompleteness in the casting. It also becomes a bit predictable unlike earlier seasons.If I would have had a known in advance, I would have not purchased this season. The earlier seasons are great.All in all, AG Show a is great classic American television show."
3,"Some good episodes, but earlier seasons better","Mainly bought this to complete our collection of Andy Griffith seasons. Some shows are good, but the earlier seasons (esp. black and white with Barney Fife) are much better. Wish there were more shows like AG today!"
3,LAST AND LEAST IN THE SERIES ! A FAREWELL TO GREAT SHOW!,If you are a fan of this show and you like seasons 6 and 7 you will like season 8 the final season. Not much stands out in this season except it is the end of a great run and opens the door for Mayberry RFD.....NO THANKS! If you own the rest you should buy this set too as the transfer is very good and it's the last piece of pie your gonna get from Aunt Bee and the rest of the gang. This is still a worthy purchase for fans of TAGS.
3,We Could Take It or Leave It,"The book is a sturdy board book. It has tractors on every page and is cut in the shape of a tractor.The content is very simple, and (in my opinion) not that interesting. The tractors look the same on every page. There is no story line. This is just a book that tells the reader a little bit about tractors.We bought it because it is a board book thinking that a board book would be for little kids. My son, who LOVES tractors is not that interested in it either. He is only two years old, though. I think the content of this book is geared toward a child who is a little older."
2,Fell apart quickly,"I have bought several children's books from this publisher, and they have all been great. This particular book, however, fell apart very quickly. My son is pretty easy on books, so it was surprising. Other tractor-themed books might be a better choice for your money."
5,Really small but cute,I somehow missed the 3-inch in the title. So I was surprised by their tiny size but they were really cute. Will hold a big rose bud or couple of small flowers. Very shiny clear glass.
3,under a buck? definitely worth it!,Tom Browne's Funkin' for Jamaica... Angela Bofill... so many great tracks - yea there's a small kennel full of dogs... but for under one dollar (at the time of this writting) this 3CD/41 track collection is guaranteed to please.
4,Victims of a Map / An Anthology of Arabic Poetry,"""Give Birth to Me Again That I May Know"" A poem by Mahmud Darwish, touched my heart. The poem begins: ""Give birth to me again that I may know in which land I will die, in which land I will come to life again."" The poem ends with the lines, ""I long for the bread of your voice, mother! I long for everything. I long for myself...I long for you."""
5,best Cayman dive guide,"Just returned from Grand Cayman, where I bought this book after comparison shopping (paid more than Amazon's price). The most comprehensive guide I saw; describes and rates each dive site 1-5 stars (with separate ratings for snorkeling where applicable); has info on access, currents, suitability plus general info on the islands. Excellent source of information."
4,the Dive Sites of the Cayman Islands,"As snorkellers, we found the book is generally quite helpful. The information ""minimum depth"" remains a mystery to us. The detail given for locating some shore access reefs is often insufficiently accurate. For instance, we were unable to find Mitch Miller's Reef, in that ""South of Cemetery Road towards Timms Point"" was meaningless given the mapping in the book and the lack of meaningful maps available on the island. Too bad, because the description is glowing!"
5,A Book of Instructions,"Judge Wachtler writes with passion about the life he had and the life he has. Beginning with a brief story of his professional standing and his illness that led to his downfall. Mostly he writes about what he experienced when he committed a crime and was apprehended and imprisoned for it. He describes his life in two prisons where he became intimate friends with convicted fellons of many hues while receiving visitis from family, friends, and former colleagues. He also describes his release and subsequent realization that he could not take up where he left off - instead he had to start over, something he has done. Judge Watchler focuses attention on the injustice from law enforcement practice of entrapments or stings. He also lays bare his soul on the unfair use of sentencing guidelines that do not allow judges to choose a punishment suitable to the crime. I recommend this book to anyone interested in American Justice in the 1990's."
5,A fine writer on a fine man,"This is a superb biography. Mark Royden Winchell's admiration for Davidson is clear, but it does not lead him to overestimate Davidson's achievements or gloss over his faults. The book, based on painstaking but lightly worn research, is just the right length, and the text, written in economical, elegant prose of which its subject would doubtless have approved, is complemented by sixteen pages of valuable photographs.Winchell furthers our understanding of a fascinating part of America's recent literary and social history. But he also gives us a sensitive portrait of a man possessed of the kind of dignity that, like much that Davidson loved, has largely disappeared from most of our world -- but which, thanks in part to Donald Davidson, survives and prospers among the inheritors of the Southern Agrarian tradition."
4,Young Love,"I first read this book when I was in Seventh Grade. I am 32 now and I still think of it fondly and keep it in my collection. The theme is an all too familiar, girl can't decide between the --bad boy-- or the --good boy--. However, the way this author writes made it my very favorite book with that theme. Every time I happen to see it it takes me back to my teen years. (Too bad you can't find a --good boy-- like that outside of a book-ha!)"
3,NOt accurate but still good,"This deck has too many errors to be regarded as a good copy of an original working GD tarot deck. Just check for yourself in Regardies tarot descriptions found in his volume ""The Golden Dawn"". Having said that it's still the closest one to a real GD deck that's available on the public market and is quite workable."
3,"No Glaze, made in China, but ...","I had these cards in 80's. I wanted another deck, since that deck is gone. The 1980's deck was beautiful. This deck I bought VERY DISAPPOINTING. The images are smaller, on the card. Images do not extend over entire card. There is NO GLAZE, so the cards seem very cheap. The colors are weak and dull. VERY DISAPPOINTING. These were made in China. I have been looking for these, Golden Dawn Tarot Cards for a while, so I was glad to even find them. Poor quality cards for Tarot. No enjoyment to look, and meditate and focus upon these cards. Games Inc does mention made in China. HOWEVER, WITHOUT THE GLAZE, THE CARDS PICK UP VIBRATIONS VERY QUICKLY. Feel good in hand immediately. So, if images were better, might be happy without glaze. So it is a trade off. For the lower price, just ok. I would not have bought these had I known the image quality, regardless of the feel."
3,It's the art I dont like ...,"I can't testify as to the accuracy of the cards' symbolism (I haven't gotten the appropriate books yet), but what I've seen gave me some insights.The main problem I see with the deck is it's art, which, IMHO, is mediocre and to which I can't connect. It's a far cry from the art of Crowley's deck, and isn't as good as the art of Waite's ""cartoonish"" deck."
3,Average cards,I was disappointed in the cards because I was expecting more of the Golden Dawn correspondences on them.
1,Addendum,This is my second review. My OS is Win98 SE. After finally getting my computer working(see my initial review). Also the Iomega installation s.ware alters autoexec and config files. I now find out that the Sonic CinePlayer software will NOT recognize the Iomega as an external drive. It only sees the internal cdrom d:\ drive. The software insists on using the cdrom drive and upon CinePlayer startup crashes because of DMA access on D:\ drive. It will NOT allow you to change/select the Iomega external drive to use. The Iomega tech support is not good and the Sonic is worse!Iomega does not support the Sonic software. Sonic cannot find the problem to date.
1,a problem instead of a solution,"After wasting 15 DVD's, I still did not succeed to end a writing session without a blue screen and a reboot. For each attempt I tried to do something like installing a patch, downloading the latest version of HotBurnPro, uninstalling Roxio, defragmenting my HD, performing a scandisk ... No success yet. Is DVD writing not mature? or was Iomega a bad choice? Next time I borrow from a friend before I buy."
4,Great Information.,"I guess John Lyons is not eaxactly known for the technical quality of his video tapes, but he is well known for his conditioned response method. For me, the content is extroardinary. He starts with an unbroke horse and teaches his Round Pen technique. Then he covers riding the unbroke horse for the first time and many problems that may arise. He also covers leg cues, teaching leads, obstacles, control, attitudes, as well as many pointers for the more finished horse. I furiously took notes and feel much more confident in my ""horse knowledge"". These tapes are for all horse enthusiasts. The depth of these videos would greatly benefit both green and seasoned riders and also other horse trainers."
5,PERFECT ~!!!!,"I never knew such movie existed. Wow..........where have I been and what have I been missing~!!!! PERFECT movie for me. It has EVERYTHING I LOVE about in this one movie, fun, funny, romance, action, beautiful places, beautiful people, beautiful music, and classy British taste and creativity. NOTHING like American movie. I love European movies. PERIOD. Listed as my TOP favorites movie of all time now."
5,Greatest zombie flick ever...,"If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Though I am not a huge fan of zombie movies, it is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. Brilliant writing, timing and attention to details make this movie hysterical. Watch it repeatedly, and find jokes that may have came too fast or that are hiding in the background. Not only funny, but a brilliant commentary on how life can slip away from us if we don't make the most of it, as we become ""zombies"" in our day to day lives. Both hysterically funny and deeply symbolic, if it doesnt make you laugh and better appreciate your life, something is wrong with you."
5,Love It!,"This is a great movie, I love it! A zombie movie that was intended to be funny! I hope they make more!"
4,best british Comedy since Monty Python,"Shaun of the Dead is such a strange movie it's impossible to categorize it in any of the traditional genres. There is a lot of gore in it to make it a slasher/horror movie, but it's so funny I would rather put in the comedy group.Either way this movie is FUNNY! Their are so many funny parts to it I don't know which is my favorite. I guess the part where there killing the zombie in the bar while Queen is playing on the juke box. AWESOME!This movie from start to finish is a riot!! A lot of comedies follow the same basic gags and jokes, this movie goes in a direction that I don't think anyone has ever gone before. And for that it deserves to be considered one of the best comedies to come along in a long time."
5,"Shaun of the Dead, even if you own it in standard version, get the HD version as well, 10x better","I almost didn't buy this movie since i already had the standard version. But at the price, i just couldn't say no. and wow, once i popped in the movie, i was greatly surprised. soo much more detail that i never noticed from the first one. This one really makes you want to go out and smash zombies heads in :Dbuy it, you will not be disappointed.SH"
5,Internationally Unifying,"I can't think of a single other movie which so brilliantly ties together industrialized, Western civilization through story and character. It doesn't matter what country you're from, or what language you speak. If you live in North America, western Europe, or Austrailia, you probably personally know a version of Shaun and each of his friends. I personally can't watch Shaun of the Dead without forgetting that there's a border between the US and Canada, an ocean between those two and the UK, and a planet between me and Austrailia/New Zealand. It has no politics, no preaching, and no culturally polarizing commentary. It's good-natured comedy, clever writing, and memorable acting. Because of these reasons, this is certainly in my own top 10 favorite movies of all time."
5,The geek perfect storm,"British humor and zombie movies, what more could a geek ask for? Brilliantly written and wonderfully acted by a couple of guys who know what it takes: write what you know and write what you love. Aside from zombies (which many of us have spent enough time growing up with to at least FEEL like we know them) everything in this movie feels real. From the mostly disfunctional relationships to the idiotic reactions of characters to bizarre situations, I think most people can relate."
5,A complete laugh riot!,"I had seen movie trailers for this at the theatres, but had thought nothing of it. Now, I wish I had been able to see this one on the big screen because it was so great! This movie has a little bit of everything: comedy, horror, drama, action, suspense, musical, and originiality. Terrific tongue and cheek humor, and the soundtrack is awesome! A real winner and I recommend it to everyone I know, even the ones that don't like scary movies. 5 stars!"
5,"There is no ""I"" in team, but there is an ""I"" in pie","This movie was suprising to watch. I thought that it would be stupid, like my mom thought. But I was wrong. This movie has very funny parts like when they want to keep quiet so the zombies won't get them, but Shauns friend, Ed, plays the slot machine and all the noises come out. This is a very good movie and I recomend it to people that want a change in zombie films"
5,Shaun,Great movie that is why I bought. Took a just about a week to receive but love this movie boy.
3,OK movie,"It's an OK movie. There were some funny scenes, but not enough of them to make this movie better than OK."
4,Hillarious spoof-like zombie movie,This movie is sort of a spoof of zombie movies but not exactly. Shaun and his buddy are slackers who find themselves in a zombie situation. Shaun and his buddy work to rescue Shaun's girlfrind and his parents and take them to what they think would be a safe haven. The zombies drive the story forward and provide a bunch of hillarious situations as Shaun and his buddy try to be heros instead of zeros.
5,Best Zombie Movie Ever,"This movie is truly a great satire while simultaneously being scary and right on the zombie money. I've watched this four times and in each viewing I saw something different. You'll laugh and cringe and then ask yourself, ""Who are the real dead in this film?""Wonderfully written, directed and acted.Frank Scoblete, author of Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution!"
4,Good British Humor,"My favorite attribute of British Humor is its unpredictability, and so goes Shaun of the Dead. A hilarious, mindless, non-thought provoking comedic journey. Watch this movie, Don't waste your time with Hot Fuzz however.Hot Fuzz (Widescreen Edition)"
5,Great!,"I loved Shaun of the Dead when I saw it on DVD. When I got a HD-DVD player, I found out this movie was on HD-DVD and I had to have it! It was better watching it this time around than when I first remember. If you don't own the movie already, you need to get it, if you do own it, watch it again or buy the HD-DVD version if you want to support the format and/or Simon, Nick, and Bill."
2,Shaun Of The Dead,This movie wasn't very funny and it left much to be desired.The characters weren't likeable and it was just stupid.Maybe I can't relate to British humor but I still can't believe so many people actually like this movie.This movie won't stand the test off time.Five years from now people will be embarrassed that they liked this movie.
2,One Scene ONLY once scene.,"It seemed this movie was quite confused with it self. It wasn't sure if it was a comedy, love story, horror flick, slap stick, serious???? What ever, I made it through it...barely. Of the entire movie one part hand me laughing to tears. It was a long road to get there but it was ALMOST worth the watch just for that one scene. I'm not going to give anything away aside from saying, Queen and pool."
1,This movie Stunk. Not worth 1 penny,"Terrible movie, low budget, stupid, not worth 1 penny. Actually waisted an hr of my life I cannot get back."
2,So-so,"For a British black comedy this one is barely adequete with some good laughs and good zombie makeup. Shaun is a computer salesman who is dumped by his girlfriend and lives with a slacker pal and a mean owner of his apartment, when zombies attack Shaun and slacker Ed with a few other people battle and then get trapped in the local pub. The funny part is when Shaun and Ed are in the backyard and think the zombie is a drunk woman and then start throwing records at two zombies. What really makes the movie so-so is because the scene where the man is ripped apart by zombies that looked so fake and of course copied Day of the Dead and the acting is tepid. Please rent but do not buy. At least watch once or twice."
2,Good movie......But,"Let me state the good before the one bad thing. It's a good movie. It's very funny and very well acted. Very well done, directing and writing. It's an all around good movie. The one bad thing is the usage of the ""F"" word. I mean Wow! It's as if the writer of the movie was granted a wish by a Genie for every time he put the ""F"" word in the script. There was one scene where I had to mute it and wait for the scene to end before turning the sound back on. I would give this movie five stars. They were lucky I gave it two."
1,DVD skipped a lot.,"I was so excited to have the DVD in time for Halloween, but was SO BUMMED when the dvd would not stop skipping. The DVD appears to be new, but the video is not of great quality. It skipped back to the beginning from the middle, then skipped a few more times and even froze once. QUALITY WAS BAD."
2,Not as good as expected,"I saw this movie with a group of friends, all of us expecting to laugh from start to finish. There were giggles here and there, and as college students, we enjoyed the excessive gore just as much as the scripted humor; however, it seemed the movie had so much potential to be funnier than it was. After the movie was over, I was glad that I brought friends in a sort of ""mysery loves company"" kind of way. Each of us thought the movie failed to produce the comedic value anticipated.The night before watching the movie, my friends and I rented ""Dawn of the Dead"" in order to understand any spoof-like jokes in ""Shaun."" And for that all I got was about 15 bucks down the drain, a few chuckles, and the experience of watching two below average zombie movies.The irony of ironies: I actually laughed just as much if not more during ""Dawn"" (a horror movie) as I did ""Shaun"" (a comedy).Final verdict: Go see ""Resident Evil."""
1,Dreadful movie,"A completely horrible and boring movie. I guess I'm supposedto laugh because it's made by brits. Afterall, if you don'tfind their attempts at drawing cheaps laughs funny it's becauseyou don't have any humor or culture.Modern PC america at it's worst."
1,Blu-Ray Review,Blu-Ray is fine. I think the movie itself is totally dumb and not even funny. But oh well.
5,"Wow, been a while since I've seen a movie this much fun","A couple of weeks ago my friends and I went to the movies to see Team America. While it was funny, there was still something missing so we hopped over to the next theatre to see a film that we'd been hearing about at conventions: Shaun of the Dead. We had no expectations, only knew it was supposed to be a British comedy with zombies in it. It could have been very cheesy so we just sat there and and about half way through, we all realized this was one of the best character comedies we'd seen, one of the scariest films in a while and a truly heartfelt film about love and friendship. We were blown away and the fact that this film was dished over two hours of fun only made it that much better. This is a film that will be cherished for years. Give it a try, you might feel the same way I did.As for the dvd, I know the region 2 dvd contains commentaries, deleted scenes and more so I am hoping all of those features will be brought overseas too."
4,great dvd but..,great dvd but it would appears to be missing the booklet inside the case so not really sure what happened there..
4,SHAUN THE ZOMBIE KILLER,"SHAUN OF THE DEAD is one of those rare comedy horror movies that works and that's because it's script takes chances and goes where many movies have been afraid to go in their satirical whimsies. The movie has some marvelously hilarious scenes (i.e., Shaun and his buddy using old lp's as killer discs, fighting over which ones they should keep). It also has some intensely dramatic and poignant scenes (when Shaun tries to prevent his friend from killing his soon to be zombie mother or when his stepdad admits to Shaun that he really loved him). Credit a remarkably versatile cast, starting with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Shaun and his buddy, Ed; ending with wonderful support from Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton as Shaun's parents. The gore is plentiful and some of it quite horrific, but the movie's genial tone manages to resurface by the end and in the extras, there are some humorous explanations for the plot holes. A well done, different film."
4,Shaun and his drinking buds face the undead.,"Great little movie... the laughs don't dilute the scares and the scares don't dilute the laughs. Also, instead of having a bunch of quickly-sketched characters (the brave guy, the smart-ass guy, the cynical guy, the cowardly guy, etc.) like a lot of horror movies, this one delivers a nice little group of nicely-drawn, multi-faceted characters. And, again, that extra detail doesn't dilute the scares. In fact, the scary and tragic scenes come off as especially scary and tragic because we get to know and like the characters involved in them. A nice sharp picture, great sound, and generous extras round out this must-see DVD."
5,"""Shaun of the Dead"" will freakin' rock your socks off!","SHAUN OF THE DEAD takes its place in my exhaulted list of all-time zombie greats. It's a classic that I'll be watching for years to come! And if you've dragged your girlfriend to too many horror films in the past and she doesn't believe you anymore when you say, ""but it's really kinda like a chick flick, it's got romance,"" you should have a better shot getting her to see SHAUN OF THE DEAD...even if she cringes at the ""Z""-word. She just might thank you afterwords!"
4,Sad commentary,A great comedy/horror hybrid but was looking forward to the commentary promised on the back and it's just not there. Just a tease I guess.
4,shaun of the dead,"This movie takes some time developing the utter misery that isShaun's life and it is rather deliberate doing so. However, after it begins, it gets really far out with a quickness. Takingpictures of the zombies and making some of the silly decisionsthat normally get you killed. Some of the zombies look great.Also, Shaun's best friend is the biggest moron you will eversee; that's a good thing. Hey, if they want to get killed itdoesn't cost me anything right? Enjoy it for what it is."
4,"A Great ""Little"" Movie","This is a fantastic small movie. Well written and superbly cast. Its got a very low-budget look to it, which actually suits it perfectly. This is popcorn entertainment at its finest."
4,Nice & clear picture.....funny movie at that too,"good movie, clear picture, great sound. i loved this movie when it came out in 2005 and truely feel it was the sleeper flick of the year. I bought this in HD just for the heck of it and it was totally worth it. The only reason why i didnt give this 5 stars is due to the fact that my copy has a slight video glitch which im not totally sure if a flaw on the DVD or a flaw from the factory. Overall, this is a great buy and im glad i have it in my collection"
2,Please Never Watch this,"This movie is the most overrated peice of british cinema that i have ever seen. The movie has no flow at all, it intertwines extreme dramatic scenes and scary ones with dead pan british humor scenes. The characters are completely different people from one scent to the next. Don't waste your time with it."
1,I am vera dissapointed,"I am very dissapointed because The product is damaged, i am a regular customer and i think You should take care of your regular customers."
1,Way overrated,"I cant understand why this film is considered by some to be something special. Granted, we all have our opinions, but if a person is interested in good comedy or crafted zombie films I would not suggest this nonsense. With comedy, their is a difference between funny and stupid, the movie is the latter. As a zombie film, their is no real horror felt, just ugly faces and some splattered about fake blood. Horror and comedy can work together, but not in this concoction. The film may have played better in England, but a good British movie works anywhere. Humor can be a matter of taste, I have to concede that. Watch and snore."
4,Funny + Zombies,"This is just a love story with zombies gettin in teh way of one man and his Tv.... i meen girlfriend. I bought this movie not expecting to much. To my suprise it was funny and the zombies where done well. There is little actual gore in the film, but it is still a good show. funny and a good alround flick, 4stars"
5,"Monty Python + George A. Romero's ""Dead"" trilogy = Shaun of the Dead!","This is a laugh out loud, fantastic comedy! The characters are rich and interesting and the movie is a delight. It's one of the funniest movies of the year. Although there are scenes of graphic violence, I think it is an integral part of the movie. Shaun of the Dead will go down as a classic among zombie movies."
4,bloody good fun..Shaun Of The Dead scores,"Simon Pegg plays Shaun who doesnt have a great life. He just got out of a relationship with Liz, played by Kate Ashfield and he lives with two roommates, one being his best buddy Ed, played by Nick Frost and the other roommate is an uptight ponce. Shaun doesnt know the world around him is changing and soon the people of the town are zombies walking eating the flesh from the humans. When Shaun realizes this, him and his buddy Ed race to go save his family and his girlfriend. Way better than expected and way hilarious....too much memorable parts, though one being the scene where Ed and Shaun chuck Vinyl records at a zombie in the back yard. Also starring Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Underworld '03, I Capture The Castle) as Shaun's step father. If you wanna laugh yourself to death, Shaun Of The Dead hits the bullseye. A bloody good time and hey...dont forget that cricket paddle. Cheers and enjoy."
4,"To: Robert ""Rob""","Go see 'Resident Evil'? You must be joking. Shaun of the Dead is a movie I like to call a ""FUN MOVIE"". It's not comedy (although it does have scenes of laugh-out-loud humor) and it's not horror, (although the gore in this film is enough to make George Romero wince.) It even slaps you in the face with a little dramatic piece towards the end (which I won't reveal.) This movie is here to poke fun at zombie movies, and also to admire them. ""Shaun of the Dead"" works on all levels because it seems to KNOW it's ridiculous.As I said before, this is a ""FUN MOVIE"". 'Resident Evil' is a movie that can't decide what it wants to be, because it takes itself seriously.""Shaun of the Dead"", like its title character, does not, and works better because of it."
3,Meh,ok im a huge fan of shaun of the dead and all the movies with nick frost and simon pegg. and i still love this movie but honestly the special edition steel case is not really special at all. the only thing special about it is the case there are no extra special features and no cool bluray menu. the menu on this is really dumb the one on the dvd is wayyy cooler. but if you find a cheap used copy and you dont have the bluray then its worth it otherwise just get the regular bluray version.
3,Zombie Film,"A worthy rental, give it credit for at least updating the predictable zombie film formula while being halfway original. The military comes out to fend off zombies at the end. Overall, a worthwhile film to rent once and some pretty standard zombie fare."
3,Not as good as Hot Fuzz,"Hot Fuzz rocked, but this one was a little slow and lacked a plot. It wa s a little long winded. It did have some funny lines that made me laugh out loud, but it was not as funny as I thought it would be. PQ/AQ 4/5."
3,I cannot understand what all the hype was about,"If you are like me, you've most likely heard over and over how hilarious this ""must see"" movie is. After seeing Hot Fuzz and Paul I fell head-over-heals for the dynamic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. I purchased this movie and assumed I was in for a huge treat. I was let down. It wasn't nearly as funny as it needed to be, and I would say it was much more graphic than it needed to be.By all means it was a ""good"" movie, but it was no where near the standard of Hot Fuzz. Perhaps if my expectations hadn't been so hi I would have enjoyed it more. In general it came off as a forgettable (if somewhat funny) film."
4,Melissa in Philly,"The movie nails the zombie satire, and has just the right amount of English humor. Love this movie, can't get enough of watching it."
5,"Zombies and comedy, what more could you want?","This movie is definetely at the top of my ""funniest movies ever"" list. The Humor of the movie might seem a bit different from the things we find funny because the film is from some other country. It is well worth $20, and is guaranteed to have you on the floor laughing.A 5...out of 5"
4,British Zombies,"Well, where to begin. I love zombie flicks, Simon Pegg is a great actor in comedies or more serious roles so, naturally, this was a good movie."
2,Mislead,"I feel as though I was mislead when I bought this DVD. Nowhere did the listing say that this was a ""HD DVD"" and when it arrived it was not compatable with my DVD player therefore I can't even watch it. Since I purchased it used, it will cost me more than I paid for it to ship it back so I didn't bother. Now I am stuck with a useless HS DVD and I still don't one Shaun of the dead!"
2,zombie movie without zest,"I'm a huge fan of zombies, a huge fan of horror-comedies, but this one just lacked zest in too many places. Boring spots here and there, slow pace, and it takes forever to get going. For the longest time I kept thinking, ""C'mon, movie, get moving!"" There are flashes of brilliance, no doubt about that, but it's too rare."
2,didn't do it for me,"I'm a huge fan of zombie movies. But for me, the combination of dry british humor and zombie horror just didn't work. If you want to be grossed out and be rolling on the floor laughing at the same time, I would recommend any ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy, ""Re-Animator"", or Peter Jackson's ""Dead Alive"" rather than this movie. I would not see it again."
2,Absolutely UNfunny,"Count me as one of those comedy zombies who ""just don't get it."" While I'm generally a fan of British flicks, this has to be one of the worse ones I've seen. The story is extremely predictable, the acting second-class, and the zombies are just not that attractive. I could barely sit through the movie -- even with fastforwarding!"
1,Just plain silly,"...and not in a good way. I would not recommend it, unless you were watching it to make fun of it at a party. Even so, it would be lackluster."
2,"very average, if not below average","Its too slow! That is why I gave it a low rating: it drags on.A couple funny spots, a couple gory spots and thats about it. If you want this type of movie, stick with ""dead alive"" ""evil dead 2"" ""night of the living dead 2"""
2,Disappointing,"I'll admit that I wanted to like this movie , but no matter how hard I tried, it just failed to impress. The real crackers here are very sparse or perhaps non-existent - the majority of the film consists of episodes that seem to hint at something funny but leave you wondering ""Was I supposed to laugh?"" . It appears to be the type of movie that aims to appeal to ""mature"" audiences but instead seems to be capable of impressing only 5-year old kids with obtrusive swearing and cheesy zombie action. I mean, c'mon, when that guy Pete inserts f**k after every word he speaks , is that supposed to actually make you laugh? On a side-note, I expected to see a lot more piss-takes on the original horror classic but there were few. Anyway, I cant see why people like film so much. Maybe because it's different, but even so, it's different in a very bad way. I strongly suggest you avoid this - even the pity that ""loser"" Shawn might be able to pull out of you wont save this crap.t"
1,One of worst movies ever,"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I know it was a spoof but it was for 2yr olds. And the actors needed their mouths washed out with soap.I wouldnt waste a penny on it. And if you want to be scared forget it.If you want to laugh forget it, it was just plain stupid. chris bg"
1,Avoid at All Costs!,"Terrible movie, looks like an amateur spoof of the classic horror movie Evil Dead. May be fun to watch for those who enjoy brains smashed with shovels and bloody guts all over the screen. For the rest 99% of you people, don't waste yout time and money."
1,Leave zombie films to the yanks!,"This movie just plain sucks. I love british humor, I love zombie movies, but the two don't mix well. At least not here. The movie is not scary at all. It has some funny parts but not enough to keep you interested. I almost turned it off before the end but I stuck it out much to my disappiontment. ""28 days later"" I thought was OK. At least it was scary! It took us yanks to get it right with the new version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" This is a scary movie! Entertaining and also funny at times. ""Shuan of the Dead"" is none of these that's why it's bad. Don't waste your time."
1,the british wouldn't know comedy if it hit them upside the head,"Thankfully I saw this movie on cable and didn't pay to see it. The movie is just boring and it's not that funny. There are funny parts through the movie but not enough for it to pass off as a comedy, there also isn't one laugh out moment through the whole movie. Also I really dislike the british accents and their sense of humor is just boring and sometimes confusing. So if you're into british comedies then I'm sure you'll love this movie and you should buy it, but if british comedy isn't your thing then don't even bother with this movie."
1,"One word "" Horrible""",I feel bad for the Brits if this is what they give 5 stars.Bad Movie in every way!
4,Well Made Movie,"This movie is worth the money, buy it! It is a zombie movie with bits of humor injected throughout. It was just the right mix not too heavy in either direction. Spots of gore and some tense scenes with some very funny bits. Not a 5 star movie, let's face it, not many are but a great one nontheless."
4,Terrific Fun,"Shaun of the Dead is a real pleasure. Quite funny throughout as we watch sleppy-eyed slacker Shaun go through a normal day of trying to get his girlfriend back, please his mom, teach his roommate responsibility and kill a bunch of zombies. Gorey in a delightfully silly way, comically scarey and a whole lot of fun. Definitely recommended."
5,Even better the 3rd time.,"I liked the movie a lot when I rented it. After seeing ""Hot Fuzz"" by the same team, I knew I had to see the movie again. It's just as good as I remember it and I caught new things watching it again. I invited a few friends over to watch it and they liked it too."
3,Nothing wrong with zombie spoofs,"when they're honestly funny. SOTD is entertaining, providing a few semi-laughs, but it's nowhere near the spoof the advertising would have you believe. I mean, it's watchable, but seems like it really can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or horror film, and because of this indecision, misses both by miles. Yes, there are all kinds of obscure and not-so-obscure zombie-film references, but they really don't make the film any better or funnier. They're just there. There are a couple of interesting (not great) special effects, and the extras are entertaining to a point (they start getting old fast) but in general, the movie's no classic; it's just OK. The hype way exceeds the flick. You chuckle, but don't really laugh, y'know? Buy it used or at a discount, or better, get it from the library."
3,Not as good...,Hot Fuzz and Paul are both funnier movies. I'd definitely recommend purchasing or watching them before watching Shaun of the Dead.
4,Funniest when watched with a group,We had seen this a couple of times before deciding to add it to our personal collection. Last night we watched with friends who had never seen it and found ourselves (and everyone) laughing even harder than when we first saw it. A must in the halloween movie rotation.
2,funny good sound,Funny movie. Good 5.1 effects. The HD isnt very high def. Can't compare with newer HD movies. Good for the price though.
4,FINALLY A COMEDY THAT DOESNT SUCK,"Ive been waiting for ever to see a comedy worth seeing, and my friends this is it. Its the funniest movie ive ever seen, throughout the whole film i actually did not stop laughing, seriously its that funny. And it actually some other quality to it other then humor, it actually some good performances esspecialy from the guy who played shaun. And it even has some shcok value too, not much just the guy getting his guts ripped out toward the end, that was crazy, everything else is hilarious. Take it from me this is the only comedy EVER worth watching more then once or even at all. And its really the only zombie movie worth watching too, i mean come on house of the dead? dawn of the dead, 28 days later and nothing happens, the list goes on, THEY ALL SUCK. I give this an 9 out of a 10, the only flaw is its too short, but definetly i will consider buying this if i can get money, and then it would also be the only comedy i own."
2,Annoying subtitles,"This will be short seeing as many others have reviewed the film already. The film itself gets five stars from me, just so that is said. BUT this DVD version deserves no more than two. The reason for that is the subtitles which seems to be the version for the hearing impaired (Example: ""Come on!"" [Line Ringing][Video game noises][Line continues ringing]). In addition the subtitle text is massively huge and makes this option more of a sour annoyance than anything else. So if you want to watch this film with subtitles, don't buy this version."
4,Why do Zombies move in slow motion?,"4 of 5 stars for the creepy sci-fi movie Shaun of the Dead. I started watching this movie with low expectations (look at the cover, come on...). As it started, I was prepared to be disappointed. So meet Shaun a male air-head drifting thru a dull life. Totally asleep about things around hm. Shaun barely notices when those people around him start to ah ah change. Yeah, change. As the people around him become zombies, they (as you would expect) move much more slowly than normal people. The zombie disease is passed person to person by a bite (zombies like to bite). So with little purpose or plan, Shaun starts to collect the people in his life who are not infected and take them to a safe place; their corner bar.A very British movie, a kinda odd and funny movie. It turned out to exceed my expectations enough that I'm giving it a 4 star rating. I do recommend this movie but not for young people; its kinda bloody."
3,ehhhh,"It was funny... in some parts,, thought it would be funnier and a little scarier. overall a good movie to waste of time in a car trip or to do something while caffeine is pumping through your body at night and you can't sleep and you are bored. overall i give it a 3 or 4 star."
4,Zom-Com Laughs,"""Shaun of the Dead"" is a fun, amusing take on the zombie film. When the zombie apocolypse comes, clueless Shaun and his loser buddy must try to save Shaun's mother and ex-girlfriend with an ill-concieved plot to wait it all out at the local pub. Hillarity ensues. There is interesting social commentary as well. One word of advice: it is British comedy, and as such may not appeal to everyone. But overall a fun adventure that's worth a check out for a few laughs."
4,One of the best in this genre - no spoilers,"Shaun of the Dead is a must-see for lovers of gory comedy. It has a well-thought out, and well proportioned mix of laughs, gore, and drama. Whereas in other zombie flicks you are solely waiting to see if the main characters are going to survive, in Shaun of the Dead you are also impelled to see whether or not Shaun and Liz get back together, and whether Shaun will make good with his step-father. The dialogue is witty and the plot is well-conceived. You will laugh. You will probably be like me and play certain parts over and over just to laugh some more. You will be compelled to feel sad. You just also may get a little frightened. Few movies can withdraw these three emotions, and Shaun of the Dead does so brilliantly.This movie didn't do so well in the theatres for whatever reason, but has achieved a cult following since coming out on DVD. Make this your next rental or purchase."
5,One of the best,"Entertains our family every time (ages 12-45)--one of our favorite movies. Some gore and language, which isn't an issue here but other parents may feel differently."
5,A Romantic Comedy...with some ZOMBIES!!!,"I received this as a Christmas present 5 years ago. This is a really good horror/comedy about a man named Shaun getting dumped by his girlfriend and the next day, all hell breaks loose. Shaun and his friend, Ed try to stop the zombies and try to survive the day. Shaun decides to take his mom, his ex-girlfriend and some friends to shelter at the local pub. The gore scenes are pretty sweet! If you have read my reviews before, you'd know that I love Zombie movies! If you love zombies, comedy, gore, and action, I highly recommend SHAUN OF THE DEAD!!!"
4,"It's a hit in the U.K., but will Americans like it?","Having purchased the region 2 dvd of Shaun Of The Dead from Amazon.co.uk last week and watching the film last night (9/10/04), I can honestly say that this film should find some cult status in the US. Horror fans will like it as well as comedy fans. It may divide some people who can't deal with humor & gore in the same film, but that's their loss. Being a HUGE fan of the British series Spaced (also directed by Edgar Wright and written/starring Simon Pegg), I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it a second time today and it's still entertaining. Simon Pegg is on the verge of breaking out in the US and Edgar Wright is an amazing talent for such a young director. His filming style is flawless and this movie is a nice start to what I hope is a lucrative career for everyone involved. See this movie in theaters September 24th!"
5,Great Movie,This is a must watch for all movie lovers.Definitely the best Horror/Comedy out there and also one of my favorite Zombie movies.
4,"The Bloody ""Best""!",Shaun of the Dead goes where no zombie movie dares to go..to England! We're not in Pittsburg anymore Barbara!Awesome addition the the zombie genre! Lots of laughs & lots of gore at the end. Check it out!
5,I garauntee that you will love this film!,"Let me be the 253rd person to say that this movie is BRILLIANT with a capital Z. Anyone who gives this film less than 5 stars doesn't fully appreciate what they have seen. I'm not the pickiest guy on the planet when it comes to films, but I do have high standards to everyone else's annoyance; so let me assure you this movie is worth buying.Quentin Tarantino said it was the best film he saw all year. That has to mean something. I'd say it too, but who cares what I think.I won't go over the plot again as I'm sure you've read about the movie from all these other comments. I'll just say it one more time, Buy this DVD! The comedy is superb, The horror is genuinely frightening, the emotion is touching and real - all at the same time.There is a reason why this is an instant cult classic."
4,Fun But Gets Old Real Fast,"It is fun, but once they get to the pub, it runs out of steam. Overrated movie."
3,"Worth to watch, but not great","I just saw this movie last nite, it was pretty good, but I felt It needed more bloody freaking scenes, more gore, it has a couple of CGI shots, but not enough for my taste, and in order to call this a romantic comedy, which its not then they needed it to make it more funny! In general is an ok flick, it has its moments, but this should not be called one of the best ones, no way. It could've been better. 3 out of 5 stars."
3,there's an old saying in hollywood,"THAT A SPOOF OF A SPOOF DOESN'T WORK. the reason for that is the comedy becomes too obvious and familiar. george romero's original ""night of the living dead"" movies are filled with comedy and satire. in the 1990's peter jackson made a gore soaked comedy, homage/parody of romero's movies called ""dead alive"". it was okay, not great. ""shaun of the dead"" is yet another comedy, homage/parody of romero's movies. it's more talkie, wittier and less gory than ""dead alive"". they are about equally funny. unfortunately comedy/parodies of ""night of the living dead"" are by now (40 years later) almost totally played out and way too obvious. more serious and original new takes on this same material like ""28 days later"" and the ""dawn of the dead"" remake are much better and are highly recommened instead of ""shaun of the dead"" (or ""dead alive"" for that matter). i'm adding 1 star for the very effective comedy before the zombies show up."
5,WHAT?!?!?!?!,"Just a word of advice to Rogue Pictures, the company that is releasing this amazing romantic comedy with Zombies. Keep the tagline the way it was when Working Title, and Studio Canal released it! It gets me sooooo mad when studios have to dumb down British humour for American audiences! ""A Smash Hit Comedy with Zombies""?!?!?!? whats that it should be ""A Romantic Comedy with Zombies!"" and the film wasn't even really a smash hit here in the U.S. it was a success overseas in England. I mean come on now would american audiences ever really enjoy an orignal film, NO!! They love cinema classics like Scary Movie 3, or Exorcist: The Beginning!!! Sorry bought the ranting but it just ticks me off! Excellent movie by the way. Great performances by Bill Nighy, Simon Pegg and Kate Ashfield, but hands down Nick Frost steals the show. Job well done lads. If you like this movie you will love the British sitcom Spaced also written by Simon Pegg!!"
1,Awful,"To put it simply, this is one of the worst movies ever made. As a comedy, it never made me laugh, and as a horror movie, it was just like any other stupid zombie flick. I can't understand why so many people love this film. It is unbelievably over-stated. This is not worth even reading about it on the back of the cover at the movie store. Don't waste your time; it would be better spent taking a dump."
1,Garbage,"What a ridiculous movie, pathetic story, poor acting, a waste of an hour and a half. This has to be up there with one of the worst movies of all times, how has it got high rankings, it's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's not well made, it is crap!"
1,Hit the snooze button,This movie was so boring and insipid! I'd like to know where all the so-called laughs are b/c they are not present in this 'spoof' I had great expectations of this movie. Everyone I talked to told me this movie was full of laughs but all it was full of was zzz's! BORRRRRRRIIIIIINNNNNNGGGGGG!
1,WASTE OF TIME.,"I love British humor but this sucked. I cannot understand why people loved it so much...Let's face it, if these actors had American accents it would be a complete flop...Also, I believe a lot of people are saying they like it to fit in."
1,this movie is terrible,"i'm a big fan of horror movies, and comedy movies, and most things british. so i looked forward to watching this one because i heard it was pretty good and funny. well it's a absolutely horrible movie and totally unfunny. an utter waste of time and money.avoid"
1,People need to be warned,"I'd heard such good things and I just thought this would be done in some sort of zany British way, but it was a lot more like another stupid attempt at comedy by Hollywood. The real plague is the Hollywood infection that's spreading across the world and turning all movies into dull, predictable garbage that just can't seem to get moving.Shaun of the Dead is lacking in comedic performances. In a movie like this you'd expect the Indian guy in the store to be surprisingly hilarious or the mother or somebody, but nobody was really hilarious. There were a couple of good moments, Shaun going over a fence and it falls down, can't think of anything else, but I'd seen that in previews. Then there's a thick accent you have to deal with and worst of all the style I've seen in every other comedy film. Pathetic. I kept leaving the room to do chores around the house. To think this got rated 4 and a half stars by the time I reviewed it. Shows you how bad movies are."
3,A good book for more advance users,"I don't have the user's manual for Macromedia Fireworks and found that this book has many features that are hidden in the program itself. The authors show a great understanding of animation steps beyond the rudimentary that anyone can do in Fireworks. One can learned the basics of Fireworks from cutting up graphics to basic animations from the tutorial that comes with the program. This book shows what you can do beyond the basics.A word of caution, this is a book for intermediate to advance users."
2,Rabbit Angstrom: The Four Novels,"It's great to have the four Rabbit novels as a collection in one book. HOWEVER, the type in this collection is lighter than normal, making it difficult to read and the weight of the printed pages is very flimsy. Had I to do it over again, I would buy the four Rabbit novels individually from used book sellers."
5,An archeology of the American century,"For anyone who has yet to discover these extraordinary, sad. poignant, hilarious novels about the lives of middle class Americans in suburbia, I have this to say: I envy you.These four novels, each written a different decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s) do more than capture the spirit of their era. They mark the changes in our neighborhoods, politics, entertainment and sports.At the center is Harry Angstrom, a high school basketball star who never finds his niche in life. Harry is selfish, insensitive, yet also heart-breakingly sincere and a kind of protypical American romantic.These books also are quite [nice] and have some of the best descriptions of sex I have read. And people have this picture of Updike as some boring WASP writer. Nothing could be further from the truth."
3,You can build arm muscles carrying this book,"I will never buy a four in one book again as it is much too heavy. As for the books, I am finally on the final book of the series. I almost gave up on the first one as I intensely disliked the main character, Rabbit. Still dislike him but I am interested in how his life ends."
4,a labor of love...,"as a primarily non-fiction reader, i was drawn to the rabbit series by the NYT list of top fiction novels of all time.. I decided to give Mr. Updike a try, and lugged around this behemoth of a series!updike's novels are interesting especially when you consider the historical context of the times in which they were written. for example, his references to sex and overt sexual language were highly controversil at the time of his writing.Reading the series allows you a seat of the passenger train of the 60s, 70s, and 80s, each which their overriding ""isms"". An enjoyable read."
5,The Rabbit series is the best American work,"Pure genius. Updike knows everything, it seems, or is close to it. He evokes emotions with relevant detail at the same time, often without mentioning a character for a few paragraphs. I've never been moved so much by descriptive writing as I have with Updike. Your intellect is left enlarged and fulfilled. The Rabbit series is also a mini history source in contemporary America, the ever present thrid person omnisicent who seems to hold sway over Rabbit's life and all his disfunctional family and common friends. A must read for the literary scholar"
5,A Twentieth-Century Everyman,"Why IS this book so resonant? Updike superbly captures the 20th Century male dilemma in these four books: How should a guy be true to himself YET a caring lover YET an effective father? How can he survive in a continuously and subtly hostile world of work so that he can still hold his head high? Rabbit's answer is to take everything one step at a time, to react, sure, but also to control when it is important to do so. As the ad for ""The Tao of Pooh"" says, (something like) ""Piglet frets and Eeyore resigns himself, but Pooh just IS."" Rabbit Angstrom is like Pooh. A guy's gotta do what a guy's gotta do. Sometimes you're right and sometimes you're wrong. Updike's straightforward, almost bland, language in his Angstrom tales is a perfect match for the job."
3,I wish it was..well...more,"I LOVE a good old silent movie and I love a good live show, I even loved the Metropolis with the 80's rock score..(I still treasure my laserdisk of it..) so I was really looking forward to this. I love the idea of this, and even liked most of it, but for the most part the staging falls a little flat on screen, I'm sure it come across better on stage."
1,Worn Out Tape - Great Movie,"Long ago, my wife and I had one of those Saturday nights when we didn't feel like sleeping. We thought we would watch this boring black-and-white movie to help fall asleep, but instead we enjoyed the movie. When I found it on Amazon, I thought I would give it a try. That was a mistake. When the movie arrived the VHS tape was un-watchable. The movie jumped, skipped and was full of snow. Ended up tossing the movie and the vendor returned my money. Sure wish I could buy this movie in good condition somewhere on modern media."
1,"Dock Designs, Second Edition",Way over priced for what you get! Based on the price I was expecting a lot more information and better illustrations. It is worth $10-15 at best.
2,Picture is misleading,The picture is very misleading. It looks as if there is white down the center of the outfit. This is not the case. The whole dress is pink. It is not as nice quality material as I expected from the picture either. It really is only so-so.
3,Great music...,"but lousy sound quality. The transfer from ancient shellac to digital may be the source of the problem, but the quality is a real problem when listening. there are a lot of Water's recordings, and unless you have a particular reason to have THIS cd, i would look further."
2,A Terrible Album with some hidden jewels,"As a whole, this album really REALLY sucks, but. BUT, it just may be worth the buy for some New Jack Enthusiasts. Three tracks save this album from hitting the trash cans: ""Something in your eyes"", ""lost in the momment"" and ""Above the rim."" ""Something in your eyes"" is perhaps one of the best R&B New Jack swings songs that never was. It never got the recognition it deserved, but has always stuck with me over the years. ""Above The Rim"" actually kinda sucks, but Michael Bivens verse always gets me going and is the only reason I mentioned this song. The ryhmes he spits are off the hook folks in ""Above The Rim."" The song ""lost in the momment"" is a little too simple for my taste, but it still manages to drift the listener away like any good R&B track from '95 can. BOTTOM LINE, if you are down with New Jack Swing and mid 90's R&B, this album is a MUST, otherwise, PASS."
3,Guess I'm biased On This One,"I recorded the original demos for ""Please Come Back"" and ""Lost In The Moment"", that the writer, Lionel, later sold to BBD. I also cut some of the vocals on this CD version. A few things that stuck out to me were that the original singer, Fatim, a 17 year old kid at the time, hands down did a better job with lead and background vocals on the demos than BBD. Regardless of that fact, ""Please Come Back"", was a hit waiting to happen; instead BBD burried it on the release."
3,"ok so you bad boys, got it, now make some tunes","So much talent, but lost in what they want to become after NE...Poison was great, now develop and not to the back streets and showcase your singing, dance tunes"
1,Shame On You Guys,"Bell Biv DeVoe half or spin-off of the group New Edition drop fall short with second release. Nothing close to Poison, so don't be surprised. Nothing on here seems to hold my attention either. The only reason I gave it a one star is because of tracks 9 and 10. Both ""Something In Your Eyes"" written by the great Babyface and ""Please Come Back"" are slow jams that you can play continiously over and over again."
4,Where is Darius?,"I bought this cd with my hard-earned money expecting that Darius guy from ""Hootie and the Blowfish"" to be singing on it....what is the deal? What I got was a bunch of half-baked R&B watered down with some fake gangsta type image. So, while I was driving my black 98 Beetle down a lonesome country road, I put the window down and threw this cd into the ditch."
5,Very Helpful Things to Make Life Easier,"The machine I'm using to write this review is the slowest machine to shut down that I've ever seen. When I was first flipping through this book, I saw Technique 6: Shut Down, Restart, and Switch Users Quickly. It turns out that there is an undocumented feature built into XP called shutdown. The book says that the machine will shut down in half the time. I found that it shuts down much faster than that.It's clear that this fellow knows an awful lot about windows that I didn't know. I suspect no one is going to use all the techniques that he describes, but some of them are really helpful. His discussion of SPAM, for instance, is excellent.Unlike most of the For Dummies books, this one isn't for the absolute beginner. While his techniques are not difficult, they do presume that you have just a bit more knowledge than trying to find the on switch. This is a very helpful book."
1,"Not much better then the old, original battery","The new batteries worked for a short time, about a week. Both then need to be recharge every day, even with only a couple of calls, lasting less then 2 min each. We have two cell phones. We are both in our 70's and don't make many calls. I wish we would have purchased better quality batteries, but this one had a high rating, so I went by that information."
4,Just As Good at Half the Price,"I purchased this battery at less than half the price of the same one available from T-Mobile for my Razr V3. The only difference I could tell is that this one is not branded with the ""Motorola"" logos. If you need those logos go ahead and pay 2 or 3 times as much!The phone I had for 2 years the original battery would just run out of juice by early afternoon with only moderate use. I have not decided which phone I want to upgrade to, so for less than $20 with shipping and taxes I can by this replacement battery and have my old phone working like new again until I decide what I want to do. The Razr V3 holds a charge all day now.As for the purchase the the battery delivery was faster than expected and I have had no other issues or problems with the seller. I am very satisfied with this fast and easy solution to my problem."
2,Smells funny.,"This curry works great, but when I recieved mine, it stunk up the entire living room with a tar/oil smell that was so bad I had to leave it on the back patio for 3 months."
5,Love this book!,"I originally saw this book at my pediatrician's office and fell in love with it because it was so colorful and wonderfully written. Once I got home I got online and found it on Amazon and to my delight it was a much better price than what was on the book itself. I immediately ordered one for my 5 year old son's birthday and 4 more for all his friends with up coming birthdays since it was free shipping. This book makes the kids questions so much easier to explain because it gives simple definitions and also uses the word in a sentence. I can't say enough about the pictures, they are fantastic!! Since giving them as gifts I've had several people ask where I got this book because they want to buy them as gifts for other friends. Just a great book all around!"
3,Not the same quality as the OEM that came with my GM Car,"I was disappointed in this purchase. The part was shipping in a plastic bag (no box) and was not an equal quality to the OEM Delco Air Filter that came with the car. It does NOT look like the OEM Air Filter that is pictured with the part. I paid extra because I wanted OEM quality. The part I received is stamped ""made in China"", and is not even the quality level of the much less expensive Fram filter at the local Wal-Mart. I believe in purchasing OEM parts, but do not waste your money on ordering this Delco part if you are expecting OEM quality."
5,Loved it!!,"We purchased this as a 40th bday gift for a person who has everything. It was a huge hit and we learned so much about our friend's life putting this together. We included pictures of family members, schools, his house, etc. to personalize it further. It definitely took time to put together, but the finished product was amazing! Highly recommend!!"
1,Not Compatible with Macs,"I just received this game for Christmas, and it is basically headed for the Goodwill pile. Everyone in my family uses Macs, and this game is only compatible with Windows XP or Vista. There really should be something for Mac users in 2012, or there should be some sort of disclaimer on the front of the box. I'm hoping that people buying this game as a gift will see the negative reviews and think to check the system requirements so that they don't waste their money."
4,Make Your Own Opoly,"This turned out to be more time consuming then expected. Also, I could not tell which side of the white adhisive paper was the side to print on & it was very had to separate. I think some mention should be made that there is no money included. It can be purchased separatly. Overall, it was a hit but if I could do it over I would have done a better job. I made it & gave it as a birthday gift."
1,Truly a ZERO,"If i could give it zero stars i would!!! This is truly cheesy!! If you are a true fan of monopoly this is truly a disappointment. Its completely visible that they are stickers. Its a great idea in theory but if you are wanting to make this a gift, pay the extra money and get it done professionally by a graphics company. I have had great success with that!!!"
5,# 1 game!,"i think this toy is fun and different then most toys! It's not like you'd expect somone to come out with a board game where your in a situation of making it "" your board game!"" You can make your own place from most expensive to cheapest* It 's the coolest game and i really recccomend it!"
1,Didn't work,"I really had high hopes for this as a gift for my dad. My sister and I tried three different PCs, but the software never worked. So now I have a $20 Make your own opoly kit hanging out in my car. I tried emailing the company over a week ago and got no response. I don't want to return it, I just want to exchange discs and see if that was the problem. I would be willing to give them a better review if they would actually help me out."
4,Fun idea!,"I got this for my mom for her birthday and designed the board and the money and everything with the included software. It was very easy to use! My first complaint is that you have to cut out all the pieces, they are not on a sticker sheet, it's just one giant sticker so you have to be able to cut straight (I'm a perfectionist). Secondly the color that was printed by my printer didn't match perfectly (again, I'm a perfectionist) to the color of the game board. It didn't have an end result that looked professional but the homemade feel wasn't bad. I'd probably buy it again."
1,Don't Buy This Cheap Knockoff,"For starters, the box is a lie. see those clean images they've placed on their Monopoly board? The program only works with bmps, and even then it makes the bmps much, much lower in quality. This is only useful for those of you who want to make some sort of 8 Bit Video Game themed Manapaly (this isn't Monopoly, I figure Manapaly is a nice cheap knockoff name for it. Like Spoder-Man and the i-Pud.)DWhat this offers is simply -minor- customization. Street names (but not the prices), low quality images for the streets and 4 of the 4 corner spaces, 24 cards to divide between ""Good News"" and ""Bad News"" (yeah, you can't name them yourself), and that's pretty much it.Don't be fooled by the box or the product description. You're better off getting some other board game kit, or simply getting some cardboard, markers, paints, paper, etc. and making your own boardgame from scratch."
3,computer program OUTDATED & HAD printing glitches,"GREAT IDEA and overall easy to use/personalize the game. Unfortunately the computer program is rather outdated (making it impossible to import pics). It also contained glitches (certain properties were repeated throughout game, rather than printing what was entered in the program). Would definitely recommend if you can find a more modern program. It was a very cute idea and made for a creative gift."
5,Grandson loved this personalized game!,"Made this for our 8 year old grandson who loves the standard Monopoly game. He loves it!! I did laminate the board and the property cards, just for durability for an 8 year old, but the project looked great either way. We tailored the properties, good news/bad news cards, and money just for him, and he cracks up when he reads our funny captions. Great gift! Jackopoly is a hit!"
2,Did not come with all parts,Item was missing several parts necessary for play - even though it was bought brand new.Found the customer support number online and called them - they're sending me out the missing parts. Very disappointing - the item will not be here in time for Christmas. Thank goodness I opened up the item before wrapping it and giving it away.
4,This is fun but a lot of work to put together,this takes alot of work to make your own monopoly.Recommend if you would waste 3 hours putting it togetherkilled my tonerhad to but 3 to get the job done
1,Disappointed Kid on Christmas Morning,"My 10-year-old daughter received this as a gift for Christmas from her 7-year-old brother. We just opened the box and, to our dismay, it has pieces missing (the clip art, 20 Monopoly buildings, etc.) Also, the CD that contains the software to make the entire game came completely unpackaged and unprotected inside the box itself. In fact, the unprotected CD was bouncing around inside the box and is (not surprisingly) scratched. What a disappointment. I've already printed the return labels and am sending it back for an entire refund. Shoddy."
3,Make your won Monopoly,i must say I love the game. It is very simple and is good for all ages. There is one problem with the game. I was shorted pieces like included paper and building additions. I then tried to contact customer services and was unable to reach them for missing pieces. Over all it makes a great gift but I was disappointed to have to go out and buy more paper from local store and have to substitute the buildings with something else.
2,Disappointing Alternative,"If you are a true Monopoly lover then, you may be very disappointed in ""Make-Your-Own-Opoly"". There are some major differences in the board from the original Parker Brother's game such as the jail and free parking and ""go to jail"" have been all changed to loose a turn and roll again and things of that nature. Also, there are no hotels or houses so you were not able to increase land value by developing properties. All in all I found it too far from the concept of the original (or parker brother produced variations) monopoly game to be able to enjoy it as a ""Monopoly"" alternative.Other deterrents include that there are only a couple of plain sheets of paper sent with it for your money and property cards to be printed on. One would need to use their own printer paper if they wanted much money at all."
5,It's a lot of fun.,"I like it because I was able to make it about my favorite spot where I like to go swimming,kayaking,waterskiing,kneeboarding,tubing, and looking for moose and deer. It was lots of fun. Me and my family love to play it.You should get it!"
2,Better viewing elsewhere,"I am a fan of Chef Jose Andres. I love his approach to Spanish cooking and avant garde cooking, especially at his Mini Bar in Washington DC. I was looking to find out more about the Mini Bar but this is not the best source for this information. A better choice is Anthony Bourdain's ""No Reservations Collection 4"" DVD. In the segment on Washington DC, Anthony talks to Jose Andres and has a degustation meal at the Mini Bar with more detail and comments than you will find in this DVD. Also, while the DVD is from the 60 minutes TV program, the segment on Chef Jose Andres is only about 20 minutes long and I felt a bit cheated."
1,didn't last very long....,disappointing. our Sharpei mix loved it but found it the easiest thing in the world to chew into pieces......had hoped it was more durable.
2,Not for aggressive chewers,"While this is more durable than a regular frisbee, it didn't take more than a few minutes for my Doberman to chew a hole through it. To be fair I haven't found anything she can't ruin. I'm in need of a new frisbee again and will be trying something else."
3,Flies well but not for chewers,"This thing is light weight and flies well. However, my 40 pound lab/beagle mix would have easily ruined it if I didn't take it away from her."
2,"cheaply made, light",Win some lose some.. That is the bottom line when it comes to on line shopping. This thing probably cost around 50 cents to make and I paid $13 or so for it....
2,Would not purchase again,"I was happy with the Nylabone Flexible Frisbee for about the first two hours of play with my Lab/Pitt mix Jerry. It's very light weight and soft, which makes it safer for Jerry to catch, but because of this it does not fly very far or well. I would not recommend this Frisbee to anyone that has an aggressive player, as it was easy for Jerry to puncture within the first couple of hours of play."
1,An argument to bring back book burning?,"I don't write reviews normally. I read a lot, some I love, some I like, some not so much. But this book is so bad I must warn you. Cliche, poor characters, ridiculous plot and I kept reading it because sadly I'm an optimist and always think, ""it can't be this bad - it has to get better doesn't it? IT DOESN'T get one bit better, just worse, which in itself is a kind of odd achievement.I'm using my copy to help start my next fire. That's the only way to get some good from it. Don't buy this book, watching paint dry is more interesting."
4,"fun, creative book","This is a fun, creative book about color and word plays. I plan to use it in speech therapy to help kids understand how words can have different meanings. The art work is great too."
1,Why is Blue Dog Blue?,I was very disappointed with this Blue Dog book. I'll put it in the grandchildrens section of the bookcase to teach colors.
4,Blue Dog,I really liked this book. I used it with my gifted students before they created their own Blue Dog pictures. Even the middles school age students liked the book.
3,hot wheels on speed.,"Let me start by saying that I did not finish this game. After 38 races in the underground mode, I felt I had seen everything this game had to offer.What it offers is average graphics, atrocious physics and boring music. I was a little tired to listen to POD for fifty times in two hours. You can have as much fun listening to an hard rock radio, playing with your kid's Hotwheels cars (well, almost).The driving mode is very ""arcadey"". Your opponents are always not very far. They are right behind you, AI cheating, or, if you had a mishap, waiting for you around the next bend so you can catch up to them.This game is perfect to have some good mindless fun for a few hours but you will not find here a replacement for Need for Speed or Midnight Club."
1,Test Drive,"This game is the worse racing game ever. The only good thing about this game is that you can put your favorite mp3's in the custom music folder and then it will play it during the game. Everything else [is bad] in this game the graphics are really bad, I've seen better graphics on the GAME BOY. Don't bother buying it cause it's a waste of money. It also takes up 1.5GB HD on your computer."
4,I like my MioPINK sport heart rate monitor,"I like to work out at home on days I can't get to the gym. With the MioPINK heart rate monitor, I can monitor time with the stop watch-type feature and check my heart rate through out my workout to know if I'm working at the right intensity. It even tells you what percentage of target heart rate that you are working at. I don't usually bring the monitor to the gym because all the gym equipment has most of the same features and it can be tight to wear on your wrist.The monitor asks for age, birthdate, weight etc so that it can accurately give heart rate. It was tough to program. It comes with instructions, but there are many little buttons that have to be pressed in a certain order to get it to register. If you hit the wrong button, which I did, it was hard to get back in to change it.Now, that I know how it all works, I'm happy I bought it. I do use it alot."
2,Difficult to use accurately,This model does not have a cheast strap. It relies on the user to constantly monitor your heart rate using the finger pads on the wrist band. This is not easy or convinient during and intense workout. To get an accurate reading you would have to be doing the same activity at the same intensity for a period of time. If you change intesity you would need to be using the fingerpads constantly.
3,sport watch,"It works pretty well, however, the pink band gets soiled rather easily and is not able to be cleaned very well.Other features do not work as well as you might expect.Keeps good time and good for heart rate monitor."
2,Disappointing,"I asked for this heart rate monitor watch as a mother's day gift because I liked the idea of not having to use a strap. However, I find that it takes too long in the middle of a class to register the heart rate. Plus, the average heart rate is not captured at the end of the excercise period, only the calories burned. I ended up returning this and going back to my strap."
5,I've lost weight with this watch!,"I have had this watch for about a year and it has helped me lose weight! Tracking my HR and my calories burned helped motivate me to work harder in the gym. Since it takes 3500 calories to burn a pound, I try to make sure my workout burns at leat 500 calories. I also like that it supports a very worthy breast cancer charity. I definitely recommend this watch if you want to boost your workouts and your weight loss program. Best, Cynthia"
1,Very diappointed!,"After only owning it for 6 months - the watch died and is no longer functioning. It is bigger and clunkier than expected and can be uncomfortable in certain positions (e.g. weight workouts). As others have commented, it does not track as much information as it could. Sadly, I'm very displeased."
5,spinning,I would highly recommend this video. The video is high energy and you can achieve a good cardio workout in 30 minutes. The only drawback is that the instructor talks too much but otherwise it is worth the investment.
4,great for beginners,good for people that don't like going to the gym-easy to use-my freind thank me for telling them about this DVD
5,Whoohoo for Mac,"This computer is just what I needed for my first Mac. Everything works great. Great way to save money if you already have a monitor, mouse and keyboard. No need to buy a $1,200 Mac system. I would suggest upgrading the ram to 1GB if you will be using advanced programs such as Phototshop, etc."
4,Mac Mini,"Love Macs (this is my 24th since 1984), but thought that this product was too underpowered for my specific need for this computer. I wanted to use it as a backup and transition system for those in my office that are still on the dark side (using Parallels/Windows). However I realized that this is not the right machine for that."
1,Bad replacement experience,The 2nd day delivery delivered a defect product. Took several weeks and a lot of emails to get a replacement. Then I found new version posted on the website right after I got the replacement.That means it took me several weeks to get an outdated product even though I used 2nd day delivery service. What a bad experience.
1,Buyer be Warned: Warranty Canceled by Adding Memory,"I bought this product last year and added 1 gb of extra memory about nine months later, the graphics card (which is integrated into the motherboard) failed. I talked to the service rep and they said bring it into my local apple store, I dropped the device off and a couple hours later they called and canceled my warranty because I had added memory. Maybe I am spoiled with my Thinkpad warranty support, they actually come to my house and fix the problem (and they don't claim that I voided my warranty by adding more memory or using a non IBM (Lenovo) monitor). If you want no non-sense warranty repairs go with IBM/Thinkpad!"
2,"I Love Macs, but","you can get a new one with specs that blow away this computer for only 100-200 more. This is great for everyday computing. Internet, docs. But if you run editing software, record and edit music, or are a download junkie. Spend the extra 100 or take the time to shop around. Has tiger OSX which was great for PRO TOOLS , but half gig memory won't cut it.PS///you risk breaking computer changing the memory, very delicate, made in mac mini' early stages."
4,Mac Mini is Great (for Windows and Mac OS,"This tiny computer is great. It's small size is a big plus for anyone with very little space in their room. I wish it had more USB ports since the mouse and keyboard already take up two (just buy a USB hub to remedy this). For people who prefer Windows, you can still use this machine! Simply search for ""boot camp"" on Apple's website. I am dual booting Windows Vista and Mac OS on my machine. Windows seems to work fine on it. The only thing is that Windows does not seems to recognize that there is Bluetooth availible."
2,Fantastic collection with lousy audio quality,"I bought this on sale for next to nothing, and it still wasn't worth it. I should have spent a little more to buy these tracks from other Stevie Wonder compilations. These are some of his best songs, and I love listening to them. But a quick listen with my headphones on, and comparing them to samples on Amazon from these same songs in other collections, really brought it home: the sound quality on this particular album is terrible. Tinny, weak, lacking depth. Do yourself a favor and treat this collection as a playlist: write down the names of these great tracks, then buy them from other collections of Stevie Wonder's hits!"
5,Definitly Definitive!,"I love it. I try to own only music that I can enjoy enough to play over & over without getting tired of it. I won't put this away, I'll wear it out."
3,"is not the ""all collection""","Sound quality is good, but inevitably need to be supplemented with other CD's... Too many tracks are under the table!"
4,Wrong place to start,"It's kind of ironic because this album is my first Stevie Wonder CD I've bought. But now that I know what I was missing, I don't want it to happen to other people.Let me list some of the BEST songs that this disc is missing- Isn't She Lovely- Golden Lady- As- Send One Your Love- Ribbon In The Sky- Visions- Don't You Worry 'Bout A Thing- Send One Your Love- Latelyetc.I'm pretty sure there are people who think those missing songs can make up a better collection.So don't even bother with this one and save money for these packages- At The Close Of A Century (4 CD Box Set)- Natural Wonder (2 CD Set LIVE)- Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants (Tied with INNERVISIONS for Stevie's best album)13 bucks was well worth for me to be introduced to the greatness of Stevie Wonder. So I don't regret anyway."
2,Great Songs - Poor Mix,"Have the people who re-mixed the songs on this album ever heard the original recordings? Fingertips,(I'm not even sure where this recording even came from) dosen't sound like the same 12 year old that I remember on the 45. Superstition? the percusion at the begining, WHERE IS IT??? Living For the City, (the begining to this song used to bring shivers, but this is disapointing, no soul here!!) This mix sucks!!! I bought this because I was thinking I would like to have a fresh version of all these wonderful songs (no pun intended), but what I got was inspiration to listen to my old albums and 45's where I can at least get the original ""FEEL"" for these great songs."
4,BUY THE DOUBLE IMPORT CD INSTEAD,"This Definitive Collection is available in a double import CD form. It's a much better overall collection than the single domestic CD, however I agree with the reviewer who noted the sound quality could be better on the older tracks. Also, if you don't already own it, pick up Fullfillingness First Finale."
5,Who doesn't love Stevie Wonder?,I love the seventies.....and this just made my collection even better. Happy with this choice-did have two of my fav's on this CD.
4,Stevie Wonder,"It took me too long to get it and, I finally got it! What a wonder, ""Stevie Wonder"" is great!"
4,Classic,Stevie wonder's music is just timeless. I wish more artists these days would take his example and make real music!
4,Great but I feel there are some great missing songs,Used to have some Stevie Wonder back in my youth (vinyl and tape) and like this album but feel like they didn't pick the best music. Maybe it was the highest on the chart or something to that degree but it left me unsatisfied.
2,A mixed bag,"If you are rather poor and can only afford one CD of Stevie Wonder, then I still don't suggest purchasing this one. Better to get any record from ""For Once In My Life"" to ""Hotter than July"" except perhaps ""Journey through the Secret Life of Plants"". I personally recomend the often overlooked ""Music of My Mind"", the deservedly heralded ""Innervisions"", or the underrated ""Fulfillingness' First Finale"". (I would also recommend ""Songs In the Key of Life) but that's two CD's and anyone rich enough to make such a splurge is advised to just get all the albums, preferably on vynil so that you hear what Stevie wanted you to hear and not what some two bit studio engineer ratcheted off after he was done playing with it."
3,Stevie Wonder - The Definitive Collection,I am a big fan of Stevie Wonder but I don't entirely agree with what songs make up the Definitive Collection.
2,"Where is 'Lately"" gone?","With this one-of-the-best heartbreaking love song of all time absent, you shameless call it this collection ""definitive""? If not fraud, it's definitely misleading."
5,Stevie Wonder - The Definitive Collection,I got this for the one song on it. SIR DUKE. Am happy with it.
2,Hurts my ears,"I must admit I'm not a huge Stevie fan, but he does have some songs that I really like that are represented on this CD. And I do respect him as a great musician.My biggest issue with this cd is the sound quality.The mastering sounds very harsh to my ears. Seems to be very compressed and a lot of treble. I find it hard to listen to actually. But others may disagree."
3,The Definitive Example of Why iTunes Store Tracks Are Better,"Listen to the samples here versus the samples on Apple's iTunes. Amazon's encoding is terrible. Amazon's tracks and albums average about ten percent less than the same titles on the iTunes store. But you are getting about 50% less quality here at Amazon.You get what you pay for.Five Stars For Stevie, Two Stars Knocked Off For Amazon."
4,"""Wonder-full""","This is missing about as much as it includes, but it is just one cd. For the most part though, this is the best of the best. Plus it's a lengthy 21 tracks. Everything from the very early ""Fingertips (part two)"", to ""Part-time Lover"" is on here. Plus the huge hits ""My Cherie Amour"", ""Superstition"", ""You Are The Sunshine Of My Life"", and ""Boogie On Reggae Woman"". Basically these are all huge hits, and whether the lyrics get deep, or keep to a love theme, they'll all have you struttin' down the city streets in your head. The only song that I really miss, is ""I Believe (when I fall in love it will be forever)"". Overall though, this is still an amazing collection, and will go great with your ""Marvin Gaye"" and ""Commodores"" cd's."
2,Stevie Wonder,"Bad sound quality throughout, especially on the earlier works.Ended up selling it off."
4,More Stevie,A great artist. You can't go wrong by having this in your collection. One of the best of all time.
1,The sound quality is terrible,"People complain about the selection of songs, but that's debatable. It has a lot of Stevie's best songs on it. The big problem is that we all know what these songs are supposed to sound like and its not how they are on the album. The recording is terrible. I am not very picky about these things. I often don't even notice the things that cause others to complain about sound quality, but it's glaring throughout this album. Just awful and frustrating. I'd avoid this album."
2,GOOD GOD,I WAS SO EXCITED TO FINALLY GET A MIX OF STEVIE WONDER. I LOVE THE OLDIES. THE SONGS ARE GREAT BUT THE SOUND ON THIS CD IS TERRIBLE. I REFUSE TO PLAY IT. IT SOUNDS SO CHEAP-LIKE FROM A TRANSITOR RADIO. I'M SO DISAPPOINTED. I WOULD LIKE TO SEND THIS BACK. THE SOUND IS THAT BAD. WHAT A SHAME.
5,Good Ole Stevie!!,Stevie Wonder is one of many of my classics that i have both on vinyl and CD. I add him to my many compilation CD's i make for travels in the car and on my ipod.
4,Lots but not Definitive,"I have not listened to this particular collection, but looking at the songs I was first disappointed that any collection with only two songs from Key Of Life and also only two from Talking Book could be titled ""Definitive"".On more reflection, this simply means that a newcomer to Stevie can buy this collection and then still purchase Songs in the Key Of Life and Talking Book without much duplication. Combined, you would now have a definitive collection."
1,It did not work,The DVD was set up to only work in the US. I have had to return it. I feel I should have been advised it would not work in England before it was sent to me.
4,memory,I saw this at school 40 years ago and always wanted to see it again. Excellent creative and very different approach. wife and grown up kids accepted it at face value and enjoyed something different.
4,Dame Maggie shines!,"A moving and exciting experience on the stage is made less so as a motion picture.However, Maggie Smith's singing and dancing are stupendous!Oh! What a Lovely War : Widescreen Edition with All New Special Features"
4,Not a toy,"This is not a toy. It is a great helicopter and wonderful fun to fly. I crashed it into my fence and after I retrieved it, it fired right up and flew again. THE ONE PROBLEM IS......AND IT IS A BIG PROBLEM, the instructions on how the remote control unit works are WORTHLESS. They are not even for this unit. The manufacturer has a great product and then drives you up the wall because he won't spend 2 cents for good instructions."
5,fun to read and fun to listen to,"I bought this book for my not yet 5 year old daughter. It was love at first sight for her. She found the stories and the pictures to be very cute!!!! The book has movtivated her to practice her reading all by herself. What is neat about this book, is that the illustrations are also interesting enough for my 2 year son, who does not mind his sister's slow reading of the story :-)"
5,What a Fun Book!,My children grew up with Little Critter's and now I am a grandmother who reads with 1st and 2nd graders. This book is great for those beginner readers
2,Not the right book!!!!,We had ordered a book and then we ordered this one and they sent us two of the same book so I am not pleased with that but my daughter had this book several years ago when she was just learning to read and the loved it so much that she wore it out. So when I saw it here I wanted to get it for my other children to read with but they sent the wrong book.
3,Leave well enough alone,"There are some fine stories in this book. The collection is great for any scholar of Malamud, or anyone who just can't get enough of Malamud's short fiction. However, the unfinished novel ""The People"" should have never been published. It's a sketch at best. Malamud wouldn't have wanted it published, and so it shouldn't have been. This book acts as though it has a posthumous novel of Malamud's, but it doesn't. ""The People"" is disappointing, and jumps all over the place. There was really no point in publishing it."
1,Photo Exploded,I had a great deal of difficulty installing this product in spite of the fact that my computer system ratings were more than double the minimum requirements. I suggest at the very least one invests in the Photo Explosion 3.0 Deluxe as you can get most of the features from the base program in shareware. The good news is there is a 30 day money back guarantee on the product if you follow the instructions. I never got it up and running in spite of several loads and reloads. I am a fairly competent computer operator.
1,PHOTO DUD!!!,"I was very disappointed in this product. It is easy to use and you can create excellent projects, when it is working correctly. I was able to complete only ONE project from start to finish before the program encountered problems and had to shut down. When trying to restart the program, you think that you are going to be able to start a new project but you can't!! I did go to the company's website to look for suggestions to fix the problem, but the suggestions did not work either. After more than eight hours of trying, I finally gave up and completely uninstalled the program. I would not recommend this program to anyone."
2,Can't write in it,"This journal does not work for a Kindle. The good reviews appear to be from people who bought the actual paper version of this book and can write in it. I cannot write in it as a journal, which is what I was looking for. But the quotes are good if you want a book with inspirational quotes."
5,The Andy Griffith Show,"Oh, how we love Mayberry. And as children, did we even know there was a moral message in each of these shows. Did people and places like this exist? I'm sure they did and still do still exist. It was all about finding the meaning in everyday events. Thanks Andy, Opie, Aunt Bea, and all of you for coming into our living rooms every week."
1,Disc Freeze and Skip!,This is the second time I had to return this DVD set.The disc freeze and skip throughout the seasons.This is a faulty item that needs correcting!!!
5,Watching this now.,I purchased this series to watch with my Granddaughter. We are enjoying watching one to two episodes nightly. It is wholesome and enjoyable bonding experience. Would recommend this for your family too.
2,"Great show, problems with disks","I have always loved the show. Unfortunatley, Disk 2 Season 1 and Disk 1 Season 2 had errors that prevented playing. This is a problem with Paramount sets. I have had the same problem before on other sets. I wish there was a way of getting replacements for just the bad disks. There is no Paramount customer service."
2,Disappointed in Quality of Packaging,For nearly $100 I would have expected something besides thin flimsy cardboard storage cases.. I planned on this lasting me for years to come.
5,The Andy Griffith Show,I love the way the series is packaged. Gave it to my wife for Christmas & she absolutely loves it! I watched a couple of the episodes & they are nice and clear.
4,The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Series,"Purchased as a Christmas gift for the entire family. Excellent series, brought back wonderful memories of my own childhood. Good TV back in those days opposed to today's violence."
5,Must See.,"Watching this series brings back such great memories and makes me wish young people had the chance to view programs promoting values, morals and all around righteous living such as this."
5,this is what it is,Got it on time and it was what I ordered. I'm enjoying knowing I have the set when winter weather is here and I can't go outside I'll just pop in a DVD.
5,Time machine,"I watched the show a few times when it ran, but I wasn't a fan. Bought the set on impulse after reading about it in a recent Andy Griffith's obituary.Aside from one DVD w/ unavoidable previews of other programs, I thoroughly enjoyed this opportunity to revisit the 1960s.Other reviews flag unreadable episodes, but I was able to see them all (Mac DVD Player) by jumping through episodes rather than using defective menus."
4,Movies a hit but the dvd holders are poor,"I agree with previous reviewers about the holders the dvds come in, they are terrible. Since Amazon lowered the price of the set I figured I could purchase my own case for them, which I did. We all enjoy the shows."
3,Bad Packaging,"As most of the other reviews have mentioned, the packaging was cheap, cheap. One does have to be careful not to scratch the discs when removing or inserting. But it was significantly less expensive than other Full Series products."
5,Good stuff,LOVE THESE SHOWS! WISH OUR COUNTRY WOULD GET BACK TO THE MORALS OF ANDY.WHAT A GOOD MAN! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERY ONE.
3,Low quality in the manufacturing process,"I was so impressed with the LIST PRICE and PICTURES on amazon of this set that I ordered four to give as gifts. When I received them they had a horrible smell, kind of like vinegar, and would need a professional dry cleaning since I'm sure the king sized comforter would not fit in my washer. I would not even know how to wash the pillows. The threads on the comforter are broken & off in some places upon inspection after opening it. It seems to be poorly made and thus the low price. However, compared to just about any other set in the sub $50 price range, it is a good deal if you can wash it and don't mind loose threads now and then. The sheets seemed very cheap quality compared to the rest of the fabrics found on the comforter and pillows. It's beautiful & impressive, but just realize you get what you pay for and it's by no means a $340 set. I will be returning my sets since I feel the loose and broken threads are a manufacturing defect."
2,"Cheap fabric, thick comforter","Quality of the fabric is cheap. The thickness of the comforter is very good. IMHO, this item is not worth $30."
1,Misrepresented Candy Molds,"I concur with Julia. I thought I was purchasing two metallic molds per thewebsite photo. When they arrived, I was shocked to see that they were made of plastic.I attempted to return them and to recoup my shipping fee as well. Iwas told that I could not. The emails from this company have been very customerunfriendly!"
4,The best of France,"Good photography - my only disappointment was that this was presented by a non-French person. The addition of French subtitles would have been a help, or English subtitles had it been presented in French. I found this DVD to be expensive."
3,Please help me out...,"I'm currently doing a project on Robin Klein and wish for more reviws so I putting out a cry for help....and a review..Hating Alison is a great book to read if you're 10,11 or 12. Or in yr six. Because you would deffinatly have someone in you're grade that like Alison Or Erika.So, if you have any info on it please send it 2 me..."
4,Erika and Alison,"Alison enroles at Barringa East and makes Erika jealous, Erika thinks Alison is perfect. It gets worse at the year 6 camp. Erika and Alison are completely opposite. Erika dreams of being an actress one day, she practice'sin the mirror. But at camp she finds out she can't act. On top of that she hates Alison Ashley. Alison Ashley is a perfect girl and an only child. She tries to become friends with Erica but fails. Alison ends up acting in the play instead of Erica. I though it was a funny book becaue Erica kept lying about things to make Erica jealous. This book waould be for any age because it isn't really restricted. I would give this book about 4."
4,Not hating alison ashley!,Hating Alison Ashley is a fantastic book about a girl named Erk who thinks she's all that. She wins everything and has heaps of friends. She thought no other girl was better. Until Alison Ashley comes along everything changes! She realises she's not so cool after all...
1,Looking for romance? Go anywhere but this book,"I'm as much a glutton for the next cliche, funny, cute romance novel but this book was ""The Next Big Thing"" of awfulness. The main character was annoying, storyline was not engaging and it was all-around not worth the read. I bought this to read on a cruise (what better ""beach read"" material, right?) and, as embarrassing as this is to admit, it was so bad, when I got home, I returned it right to the bookstore where I bought it. So save your money and read something else - anything by Susan Elizabeth Phillips will give you a perfect beach and non-beach read. Or, if you're looking for this subject matter, go for Jennifer Wiener or Jane Greene. Pass this book up."
1,who do I see to get those 2 days of my life back?,"This book was a waste of time, at best. The main character was an obnoxious, whiny, pithy character who you kind of will to fail throughout the whole book. I'm an overweight girl myself, and I would rather change kitty litter than lie to someone online about what I look like. And most overweight women get lots of attention from men who like overweight women. I do feel judged by society and ostracized at times, but I've never been lonely...unless by choice. Don't read this book. Get some Douglas Adams."
5,From Fat to Famous,"Kat works at an ad agency and at over 200 pounds has always wanted to be thin, especially after starting a ""relationship"" with Nate from England. Then her friend tells her about a new reality show called The Next Big Thing were fat people try to loose weight and gain money-with whoever gets the most money winning.Kat gets picked for the show and gets to be friends with some of the other contestants-but things are not all they she thought they would be-especially when she gets a suprise visit during a live show.What happens? Read The Next Best Thing"
5,Great book for anyone waiting to live their life...,"I am so glad I purchased this book. It was funny, sad, and the characters make you mad sometimes! I bought the book a month ago and have already passed it on to two friends who love it too! Very easy read, and definitely a page turner. If you are tired of waiting for something big to happen in your life, read this!!"
4,Very enjoyable and fun!,I would recommend this book. It is chicklit at it's finest. Good summer book to read!
4,"Funny, funny, funny",I liked this book and I also liked Eating Heaven. You should check it out too. Next Best Thing is very cute and extremely funny. It will be a good pick me up for people who are depressed and discouraged about their weight. It also motivates you to want to take control of your life and make changes. The only angle that was kind of not good was the romance with the main character and the host. It did not totally ring true until the end. But this is a small gripe in an otherwise masterpiece. I highly recommend.
3,"Good, but annoying at times...","Most of the book is very good, and the author has a very fluent writing style... however, around the middle of the book, the main character began to grate on my nerves with her annoying quips and sarcastic comments. Worth reading, but I lost my connection with the main character when she became a brat."
2,A little lacking,"I thought that this book seemed to try to fit too closely to the ""cookie cutter"" chick lit formula.Overweight girl, reality tv, gorgeous guy.....While it was an easy read, it was not, in my opinion worth the time. I think it could have been done much better."
5,"Really fun, but also makes you think","I read this book really quickly. It's that kind of read where you start one night and are finished by the next night. The author moves the story along very fast which I thought was great. And the characters were all really unique and different. I laughed out loud and related to the weight problem of the main character. She was so realistic, which was great. This book makes you think a bit more than other chick lit novels which is good. It has a lot of depth but doesn't bog you down with too many details or depressing storylines.This is a little bit trendier than the other chick lit I've read. It has more pop culture and tv references."
5,"A Fun, Summer Read","I really enjoyed this book. It wasn't a literary work that will be passed down through the ages, but it was a fun, easy, summer read. I read most of the book in one afternoon. Initially, I picked up this book because I loved the Biggest Loser TV show. In actuality, this book isn't about a weight loss show as it is about the personalities of the people she knows and meets. Very enjoyable! I look forward to reading her second book!"
2,I feel dumber for having read this book,"I picked up this book in a hurry when I was looking for some light reading to de-stress. I wish I would have been more discriminating. I'm as much of a fan of ""mindless"" books as the next person. Unfortunately, there is nothing redeeming about this book. It is neither clever nor entertaining. This book is devoid of originality; it's simply a bad copy of a Jennifer Weiner novel.The poorly-developed characters are nothing but the same formula players we see time and time again. The main character is unlikeable and all of the ""heavy"" women portrayed in the book are portrayed as being stupid and/or unstable. Most importantly, the story is predictable and borders on being downright stupid. The only reason that this book merited a second star was that I was able to stand to finish it - merely because I paid money for the book and thought I should. Had I borrowed this book, I wouldn't have bothered. I could predict what would happen anyway."
2,I don't get it...,"So many reviewers loved this book, but I just don't see why. I really looked forward to reading it because, like the main character, I am 27 and overweight. However, it just didn't seem that believable. I just find it hard to believe that the woman who was deathly afraid of shopping at Lane Bryant by herself because she might be seen and taunted could become the ""poster child for overweight women everywhere"" on a national weight loss reality TV show. Isn't that a bit of a contridiction? Rather than find Kat endearing, I found her annoying and not all that funny. Maybe it was just me, but this book seemed mediocre at best."
3,Just good,"At the beginning I liked it, it kept me there, at the end I was bored. It's the first book I read of J Edwards so maybe I'll try others."
5,laughed out loud!,"I couldn't put this one down! Kat is an overweight girl, looking to lose weight desperately. She has an attractive online boyfriend that is starting to get antsy waiting to meet her. She decides on auditioning for a reality weight loss TV show. Hilarity ensues. Kat is never afraid to speak her mind, and I couldnt help but laugh out loud, groan, and blush right along with her. Suprisingly it was an honest and witty look into reality tv and women in general who struggle with weight loss. A fun read with many twists. I loved it."
5,Enjoyable first novel,"I really, really enjoyed this first novel. It's light and fluffy fare for a relaxing day when you want to escape from your problems. The best books take you away from your world and let you enjoy another's life, and this did just that. Kat, as a main character, was very sharp and often funny. She didn't get on my nerves, and wasn't your typical whiney female protagnist, which I liked. I often feel female protagonists in these types of books can be too self-absorbed. That was not the case with Kat.The overweight characters were very realistic and the dialogue and the scenary fit very well. The pace kept moving at an admirable speed and I never got bored or lost interest. I also chuckled to myself and even outloud at various points."
5,work nice,it was install before sandy came .work good for 3 day i had the generator on.all was after sandy.....reman it .
3,Disappointed,Item came with screw missing. There is no cover for the outlet. Information that comes in box says you could order accessories like a cover for the outlet. It should come with an outlet cover.
4,lots of laughs!,"Very informal talking and conversation, like on a radio. Some humor not for all, but most is very interesting and even though a little outdated still brings many minutes of laughter. I mostly bought it for the 'boob job for Christmas' as it is hilarious, but as a whole is good."
5,HEY BOBBYYYYYY !!!,I was fortunate to have watched Bobby Orr's entire Boston Bruins hockey career on Bostons TV 38.When it comes to ranking NHL defensemen look in the record books.As for the figure it is a very close likeness very well done. When Bobby attends a ceremony at a Bruins game he gets a very loud standing ovation from everyone in attendence. What else can you say? It's Bobby Orr #4.HEY BOBBYYYYYY....!!
4,Mirror,"A beautiful mirror and a good size. The color is a little more red then I was hoping and expecting, but it still looks fine with my brown furniture. It is also light enough to move around which is very nice."
5,An A+ Gift,I bought this for my parents for Christmas. They had been looking for it for a long time.They have had great enjoyment out of this DVD set and have told me how the comedy is so much better than anything on TV today.I've watched a few episodes with them and they were funny. I hope that the rest of the seasons come out soon so I can continue to see my parents giggle like teenagers.
5,PURE ENTERTAINMENT,"I received this set for Christmas. I really expected the shows to be hokey and maybe a little embarrassing to watch. OK, so they are a little hokey, but I can't beleive how much I LAUGHED AND LAUGHED at these episodes. The in your face moments between Sgt Carter and Gomer are hilarious. And being MUCH older now I can better appreciate the comic chemistry of Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton. What a deliciously funny pair! Can't wait for the next set. More Gomer. please!"
5,"What, no black and white version?",I've been waiting for these for a long time. Has anyone heard about a release of season one in the original black and white?
4,Shazam!,"A guilty pleasure. While not consistently as funny as its parent, the classic 'The Andy Griffith Show', 'Gomer Pyle, USMC' was warm-hearted, filled with memorable characters (Louann Poovey, Sergeant Carter, Miss Bunny, Duke, etc.) and frequent laugh-out-loud moments. Many (most?) espisodes are superior to the majority of TAGS seasons six through eight."
5,just as funny as I'd remembered!,"I read a lot of reviews before I purchased this dvd set and I almost did not buy this set. This set is exactly as it was listed on the web site. It arrived promptly in perfect conditon. It is new and it is the full tv programs, nothing left out.Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. - The Complete First Season"
5,Shazam!! This is Awesome!!,"Of course I'm a little biased being the huge Gomer Pyle fan I have always been; but this box set features episode intros and comments from Jim Nabors and Ronnie Schell(Duke Slater), the visual and audio quality is great, and best of all, the episodes are shown totally uncut. A real treat considering that whenever you see old reruns on cable channels they are always butchered to make room for more commercials. This box set is a must for even the most casual Gomer fan. I just hope the other four seasons of Gomer Pyle appear on DVD in a timely fashion. I can't imagine releasing the first season without releasing the entire series."
4,Great...but a few oddities,I was thrilled to see this come out on DVD. I was disappointed that the first season theme music had been replaced with the second season theme music. There are a few episodes that are awfully fuzzy...but they are still clearer than my old VHS tapes. The original intro by Jim Nabors explaining the Pilot episode was cool to see as I was too little to remember that. Looking forward to season 2
1,"It was the best of spades, and the worst of spades","True, the handle will never break. The blade will fold over along a designed-in weak axis within a day of serious use, as it did for me. I shall now see if the ""lifetime"" warranty will be honored, or if any use of this tool on material (like soil) that is stiffer than sawdust will be considered an abuse."
4,Love in a Hateful World,"Highly entertaining Historical Fiction set in England after the death of Elizabeth I. The protagonists are unjustly accused of witchcraft, sorcery, and apostasy. The characters, including the villains are well drawn; the writing is excellent. The story is hard to put down. Even when facing certain death, the love of the main characters transcends the surrounding world of intolerance and hatred. The novel is possibly one of the most romantic stories I have ever read."
1,ALMOST PERFECT but HUGE DESIGN FLAW!!!,"Love everything about this drive EXCEPT for the LACK if a ON/OFF BUTTON!!!!!! If this drive is left ON long it gets VERY HOT....it will eventually die out if left on!!!!When I called IOMEGA Cust. Support, they told me the solution for dealing with this would be to unplug the drive when Im not using it and to plus it in each time I use it- HOW REDICULOUS!!!!!POOR DESIGN because of this one, but MAJOR FLAW!!!"
1,trusted name...horrible product,"It's going back.Corrupt documents, crashes, double clicking document icon-nothing happening, crazy errors like""...document contains foreign languages, can not open,"" firewire connection problems and it's only been two weeks... I lost 2 annual reports with billings of over $1 million. Unfortunately, It seems like the other external hard drives have problems too. So now I'm going to try the LaCie."
1,Way out there...,"I wish I'd found some way of listening to this before I bought it. I just love the 'theme for an imaginary western' - Leslie West et al have done killer covers of this. Here is the original, and its awful beyond redemption. Jack was a major element of Cream and I love some of their songs. But not these songs. Most of the album sounds like very early Genesis in their formative years but played to a regular rythym, with chinzy, cliched keyboards, and with the bass player on steriods. I like early Genesis but hated this so much I cant play it more than once. Poor production doesnt help. Sounds flat.Well I guess if you like jazz you might like this but if you dont you wont. Hear it somehwere before you buy (you cant on Amazon...)I am just stunned that all the other reviewers gave this five stars"
5,Songs For A Taylor,"Just wonderful, Jacks best solo album without a doubt, even The Beatles asked jack to play it for them @ the Apple offices..!!"
4,a strange but interesting debut,"i like this album but i think it is really worth about 3.5 stars. it is certainly different from what one might have expected from bruce after cream broke up. my favorite tracks are to isengard and the original theme from an imaginary western, later covered superbly by mountain. this should appeal to cream fanatics and others interested in jazzy improvisational rock, offbeat balladry, late 60s early 70s music etc. bruce's top notch vocals and excellent instrumentation, (and not just on bass guitar either) are on display in this solid effort. sometimes i wonder why he never became a big star because he is so gifted,but i think he may have purposely chosen a non-commercial route. i think that clapton , on the other hand, became very commercial after derek and the dominos"
4,Glorious -- but HARMONY ROW is even better...,"Some nitwit has let Jack Bruce's 1971 masterpiece, ""Harmony Row,"" go out of print. A pity, as it is one of the most deeply serious and profoundly rich rock albums ever. A sort of poetic gloss on Malcolm Lowry's ""Under The Volcano,"" ""Harmony Row"" is a timeless song cycle that shows just how deeply expressive the rock aesthetic really was. Or even IS -- as the High Llamas have proven with their much more recent but superlative recordings. ""Songs for a Tailor"" is splendid, though, especially that glorious elegy, ""Theme For An Imaginary Western."""
4,A Well Recommended Book!,A recommended book to anyone looking for a good read. Brenda Hampton done a very good story. She really knows how to captured your attention from the very first page. Keep up the great work~
5,How can I be Down?,I am from the Midwest and this book is awesome!!!! I love the way Mrs. Hampton change up her writing styles. I start reading her books and find it hard to move on to a new author!
4,Action packed,"The book was pretty good but I kind of predicted one of the crucial character's occupation. Kiley has a huge responsibility but folks in his ""inner"" circle aren't who they appear to be."
5,Donna E,The book arrived in a timely manner in the condition described. It will be a great resource to have in my business library.
5,Sweet and gentle book,"I'm on a Kathy Troccoli book kick! This is the fourth one I have read, and I really enjoyed it. Using a combination of prose, song lyrics, and Scripture, Kathy illustrates the deep love that Jesus has for each one of us, how his love is truly the one thing we can always count on. There will be something for everyone in this little treasure - from stories about women she's met, to a soothing psalm. I'm glad I am adding this to my tiny library."
5,Review of Crescent and Star: Turkey between two worlds,"Considering that this is basically a history book, it is really excellent. Not only is it factual of recent (i.e. 20th and 21st century) history in Turkey but is is also very readable. As a new resident in Turkey I have found it very informative and has helped me to understand the new dynamic Turkey that I see developing so rapidly now. Excellent for anyone who wants to understand why Turkey wants to join the EU, or intends to travel or move there."
3,Not History,The book is an easy read The book provides the authors perspective on Turkey. I would like to see more facts and less opinion. Did the author have an agenda?
4,Pretty Good Look at Turkey,"I was interested in understanding a little bit about Turkey both because of the role it has played in the current Iraqi war and also because my officemate at work is Turkish. The author can be a little repetitive at times, but overall I found the book pretty interesting. Talking to my officemate I also believe that the author has done a fairly good job of accurately capturing the country of Turkey. I also liked the style of mixing in less formal, more personal short chapters with the more historical and formal chapters. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to better understand the country of Turkey."
4,Turkish Story,"I have read Mr. Kinzer's book with great interestI have been following his reporting throughout his residence in Turkey. His reports in the NYT were excllent too.Mr. Kinzer appears to have a deep understanding of past and present turkish society. For sure the book will generate endless debate in turkey.One question I would be asking; would Mr. Kinser feel same way after September 11., regarding turkish religious right?In general, many thanks to Mr. Kinser for his addressing important issues facing the turkish nation from the pen of a friend."
4,Turkey,I read this book seeking to learn more about Turkey and accomplished my goal. The book conveys insights from the author's experience as well as his analysis of the country. He revealed a side of Turkey which was not always positive.
2,another book on Turkey,"The book is an interesting attempt to formulate some impressions and views about present day Turkey. Besides a few wellknown cultural and popular findings, the author's views on Turkey's foreign policy, the role of the military, Ataturk's reforms and Kemalism, on Kurdish problem, Armenian realities and on Turkish-Greek relations are rather shallow.Statements such as Turkey's ""political and psychological underdevelopment"" (Page:24), Turkish ""National Security Council"" is like the ""Iranian Mollahs' Council of Guardians"" (Page:17),""Turks are victims of Devlet"" (PP:12,26-28 and 145) are erroneous and misleading.As regards the ""politics"" recommended by the author; these are not at all adequate to Turkish realities and to Turkish historical background.Kinzer is of course not the only writer who after having lived in a country for four years feels quite confident and entitled to recommend major policy changes or cultural shifts towards new horizons. This is an unfortunate mistake."
2,One Sided look At Historical events,"Stephen Kinzer has spent time in Turkey and does report of truths on some political issues, but goes into a world of some historical points that he believes to be true. He has no evidence in some of these points he makes. He is not a historian and can not accurately claim some of these events he mentions. On the political side of things he may have an opinion, but opinions are just that. Let us remember that Stephen Kinzer was there as a journalist and certain points journalists make are not always clear and concise."
3,"Kinzer, first live like a Turk, then write your next book","This is a well-written book, but as a Turk (meaning not necessarily in terms of ethnicity, but a person living in Turkey) I hardly agree with Kinzer's observations. One can easily say that Kinzer understands Turkey's problems. However, his solutions to these problems are oversimplified. Kinzer tries to define these problems from multiple view points, but fails to do so. Next time, he may try extending his stay, and live like a native. What he did until now is to live as a foreigner, or an advanced tourist, and wrote as if he lived like a native. If he had really understood Turks, he should have learnt that Turks tend to say the truth only to their friends. Foreigners are always foreigners and they are told what they wanted to hear. And being a friend in Turkey takes drinking Raki for many many years, not a few months."
4,Worth reading for Turkish people,"Having lived in Turkey makes a person too much get accustomed to Turkish way of thinking. This is, of course, not a good thing, if you are wondering about how Turkey can become more civilized, or join European Union.This book gives a fresh perspective on Turkey by an outsider who understands Turkish culture and mentality. Its points are well made, writing style is crisp, and occational prose is delightful. Perhaps most importantly, the author's points on Turkish state, democracy, and Ataturk are worth thinking for any Turkish person.I would recommend you to see what a US person thinks when he goes to live in Turkey."
4,Greatly impressed,"When the writer is enthusaistic about the subject, I find it extremely fun to read. Mr. Kinzer certainly is passionate about Turkey, the cultures, the history and the politics. Well worth the time to read as I gained many new ideas for our trip we have planned. A very good book for the history of the Republic, and the geographic area around Istanbul. The writing is vivid, the subject well researched and the writer bings the readers with him as he travlled all over the country, including being held in jail overnight for interrogation as to what his reporting trip was really all about. Time well spent with this book."
5,More than history,This book is written for people who want to understand Turkey and Turkish culture. Well written and gives a better understanding of what and who you meet working in Turkey. A must read:-)
5,A good feel for the country.,"When we travel, I like to read a book about the country's history before we go so I have a better understanding of the people and the places.This book is excellent for that purpose. It is not a chronological History of events, but short (about 30 pages each) essays about a person, an event, the culture, ethnic groups and religions. I found it very easy to read and it kept my interest.I would recommend it for someone who wants to know more about Turkey's culture."
4,Crescent and Star: Turkey Between Two Worlds,Excellent account of the political history and culture of Turkey and the limited option to achieve democracy.
1,Crescent and Star - a find read,For anyone who is interested in present day Turkey this is a book that is very informative and interestingly told. His subject -- a very complicated land -- is brought to life clearly and colorfully.V. Green
1,"Oversimplified at best - on the edge of ""naive"" propaganda","This book seems to have been written from a safe distance; maybe from the barcony of a five star hotel. It's oversimplified at best, although I have to say it does make a good attempt to describe the people of Turkey.It's only when talking about the goverment and politics where Mr. Kinzer fails us. He fails to mention HOW a coutry with the most genocides in recent memory, and a military that runs things can be a true democracy. Conviniently skipping the genocides of Greeks, Armenians and Kurds jumping from the present to an ancient past that in no way connects to the current inhabitants in the area (who came from central Asia and in no way are associated with the history sang by Homer in the Iliad), he would have us think that history can be re-written.History can help explain the present, because history shapes the present.Very dissapointing.Maybe Mr. Kinzer can make another attempt after he studies the history of the region."
3,Just a personal opinion.,"Mr. Kinzer needs to do more of his history homework and less of a mezza eating, raki drinking before he makes statements on so called ""dark side"" of Turkey regarding Armenians.I would recommed that he reads ""Death and Exile"" by Justin McCarthy then revise next edition of book."
2,The author tries too hard to satisfy both sides,"The author tries too hard to satisfy both sides. Each time he criticises something, you know that a few paragraphs or pages later he will be delivering praises. That kind of book would have been natural by a Turkey author who knows that he or she may need to deal with that state and that army the rest of his or her life, but I was expecting a much more clear book from a foreigner who had the opportunity to see many abuses in the country. He also adopts a paternal attitude trying ""to show"" to the Turks the road toward development and democracy. Besides, the chapters are a kind of long newspapers articles, rather than real chapters on the recent history of Turkey. I missed at least a chapter about Turkey's economy, since there was none. Of course, the book teaches about Turkey... since I assume that most readers (like me) will know very little from Turkey before reading the book, but I was expecting much more from the book when I decided to buy it."
2,"Balance, please","This book should be balanced by a careful reading of Speros Vryonis'The Turkish State and History: Clio Meets the Grey Wolf.Kinzer, as one other reviewer pointed out, is not an historian, and he has left out here the serious history of oppression against minorities, including the Armenians, Greeks, Jewish people, and (more recently), the Kurds.Unfortunately, this book lionizes Kemal Ataturk, while failing to analyze his serious historical shortcomings. It's unfortunate, because Ataturk set in motion notions that Turkey is the source of all civilization, history and language, and racist theories that, in Vryonis' words, amount to the Turkification of Gobineau.Whatever it is, this book does not honestly assess the essence of Turkey, its history, or its future prospects.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
3,Yes but,"You can learn a good deal about Turkey from this book but it suffers two weaknesses. One is the heavy-handed prescriptions for Turkey which the author voices repeatedly; while much of the analysis seems cogent, there is an almost-arrogance in the idea of an American reporter telling the Turks how they should fix their nation. The second is the almost total omission of any discussion of the role of women in the culture --- a critical and profoundly interesting question as the country finds its way between East and West."
4,The Art of Seduction,"Coco is a retired exotic dancer. She's now selling sex toys and teaching stripper classes. Her daughter, Ginger definitely has not emulated mom. She's in training to be a pastry chef. She disapproves and is a bit ashamed of her mother. Ginger's at the opposite end of the spectrum, straight-laced and well...sexually repressed. But when she discovers she's ill-equipped to entice the man she's after, she turns to dear old mom for some mother advice on the art of seduction. This book is a fast and fun read. It's a tad bit naughty...but just a tad."
2,Find another book...,"I bought this book as a package deal, so this one was only $5. Well, there is a reason its so cheap. This is clearly an amatuer try at chick-lit. Her plot has holes in it and relies heavily on cliches. I would like to say that its entertaining, but mostly I was frustrated with writing. The concept of the book sounds hilarious, so its too bad. There are so many good books out there. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Disappointed,"I just got done reading this book, and I can say it was almost a complete waste time. It was all wining and insecurities. The ending was okay(I've always liked a happy ending), but the book kept draggin on and on... and what did she ever do with Leah's journals. they never explained that, or was I dozing off during that chapter?"
1,"turgid, awful","I so much wanted to like this book. Someone recommended Dead March to me, but I thought I would start with this one. Cardboard characters, trite scenes, bad dialogue. I would rather be watching who wants to marry a millionaire than read anymore of these."
2,"Good ideas, poor execution","McMillan has some wonderful, dramatic ideas in this book. However, she doesn't convey them well on paper. Her work lacks dramatic tension and emotional impact, and important plot twists go by so rapidly the reader's left going ""Huh?"". I like that she deals with the issue of race in 19th century America without resorting to stereotypes, and I thought her battle scene was reasonably well done. Still, the shallow nature of the writing ended up leaving me cold."
5,Wicked Witch meets Old MacDonald and the Big Bad Wolf,"This book rates more than a ten. My two year old daughter loves it so much that she has memorized most of the dialogue. It's hillarious to listen to her screech ""Fork over the pork you walking milk machine, or I'll curdle your cream!"" She loves this book so much, we have to read it everynight. But the book is so good, and she has such a good time with it, that we don't even get bored."
3,Not for preschoolers!,"True the illustrations might be artful and the story original and funny, but this book is not for preschoolers. As a mom of a young child, I became aware of this book when in appeared in my daughter's preschool classroom. When I stopped by to read a story and the children were helping me select a book, many asked that I avoid ""Piggy Pie"" - it really really scared them. My own daughter told me she had to ""sneak"" by this book in the classroom as it scared her. Parents and teachers too often introduce content that they personally find to be witty and artful and are unaware of the impact on the youngest audience- skip if for now, and consider this book for children Kindergarten age and up."
5,Hilarious!,You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this great book. My sister and I are in our 20's and can never get enough of it. We just love to read it aloud to each other and laugh. The pictures are wonderful and just make the story even funnier. It's a must...
3,Clever book with a unexpected piggie plot.,"Critch the Witch is evil. She wants piggie pie and needs 8 pigs to make it. She flies to the nearest farm where she sky writes, 'Surrender Piggies' to scare them into a pile of pigs. When she lands there isn't a pig in sight. Meanwhile in the barn, the clever pigs are putting on other farm animal disguises. A few dress up as chickens, some wear a cow costume and others pile high enough to act as the farmer. All of them tell here there are No Piggies to be found here. The mad witch spots the big bad wolf (all skin and bones from being tricked so many times by the pigs and never getting a good meal) and decides to Have Him for lunch instead. Great illustrations, scary witch pictures for little kids but fun farm pictures for identifying the piggie tails and hooves in each disguise. My only complaint is that this story is a bit wordy."
3,My book review,"Gritch wakes up and she wants something good really good she wants piggie pie. she has everything tomake it she thinks, but no, she does not have pigs. Will gritch get the piggies? To find out go readit. I really like the book because it is funny and the pictures are too. I like gritchcause her temper is so short . You shoud read this book . My favorite part is where gritchstomps her feet she points her feet and she is mad beacause she does not have pigs. this book is good forall kids of all ages. I've loved this since I was in 1st grade ."
5,"A great read-aloud, twists on a well-known song,poem,movie.","Piggie Pie is at its best when read aloud with great flourish. 2nd and 3rd graders love it, and can easily identify the references to ""Old MacDonald"", ""Wizard of Oz"", ""The 3 Little Pigs"", and ""Over the River and Through the Woods"". I used it for Nevada Reading Week, complete with the goggles and the green fingernails. I highly recommend this book; practice it first for the most effective reading to a class!"
5,mikey52791,I think this book was funny and is good for all kids. The reasons I think this is because all the tricks the pigs do to make the witch mad was funny and the ending with her and the wolf.
5,My teenagers still talk about this book,This book was such a favorite of my now 17 year old daughter and 14 year old son! The kids were just sharing fond memories of me reading this book to them when they were little. Listening to them reminisce about me reading this book to them made me decide to order a new copy now to stick in a surprise memory book for my daughter when she goes off to college next year :)Don't miss a great book to share with your kids!
5,family favorite,"My family loves this book. My husband reads it to my children, ages 13, 5, and 1. They love it, he does the voices of the characters, which is great fun for everyone. My oldest says this is her favorite book from when she was little. I'm buying copies for my toddler aged neice and nephew."
1,Unhappily Ever After for my Princess!,"Product arrived broken and when it was corrected with the company, the wrong parts arrived. Twice, the wrong parts were shipped and on the third try, the screws were wrong and the mirror could not be mounted properly. The product is a cute idea....but the construction of it is terrible and not durable at all (especially for kids)!"
4,Fun!,"Pretty nice set. Only complaint is that the mirror isn't that high-quality, kind of streaky and foggy. My daughter loves this vanity set, she is five and it was a great gift for her."
5,Cute and durable.,Our daughter has had this for several years and it's still going strong... even the chair. It's been made a mess multiple times and baby wipes have worked to clean all the surfaces off. Be careful when first setting it up... it can break easily until it's put together and in a stable place.
3,"Good, not great!","Having read and devoured all of Laurie R. King's books about Sherlock in his later years in Sussex(albeit married to Mary Russell and still in fine form as a consulting detective), I was anxious to get another author's take on that subject. I had heard that Pulitzer Prize winner, Michael Chabon's book was one to read. What a disappointment! I found the mystery itself, far beneath Holmes's capabilities and I think he probably would sniff at being drawn into such a silly case. I did not appreciate Chabon's description of the elder Holmes as a decrepit, sour, kind of smelly old man. I realize age changes a person somewhat but Chabon's ""old man"" was just too uncharactersitic for me. The ""mystery"" was easy to figure out and I am not one to always know the ending halfway through the story. Just my opinion. I think there are much better pastiches out there than this one. I highly recommend Ms. King's books for the definitive idea of Holmes ""in retirement""."
4,A little gem,"Michael Chabon has produced a delightful gem of a book. The Final Solution is exquisitely crafted and reveals rich layers of learning on obscure subjects from bee-keeping to 1930s motor cars. His portrait of an elderly Sherlock Holmes, never named as such, but so finely captured in fragile old age is a delight. He gently mocks the mores of little England while at the same reminding us of contemporary horrors as reflected in the silence of a small wartime German Jewish refugee. The strands of mystery and murder are at last pulled together and explained by the wise, faithful parrot who alone understands what it is all about. A clever, touching account humorously and deftly told."
2,Couldn't finish it,I guess I'm in the minority but I couldn't get past the first few pages; it was just too awkward and difficult to read-filled with literary cliches.
4,A gentle mystery with well-drawn characters,"THE FINAL SOLUTION offers a concise yet elegant demonstration of Michael Chabon's impressive literary gifts. These include his ability to write beautiful prose; his knack for capturing characters, even minor ones, with brevity and precision; his tendency to endow his characters, even those who commit serious crimes, with some redeeming goodness; and a narrative gift that leaves no loose ends. (In this case, the final connection occurs in this novella's last paragraph as a train passes through a station.)Compared to THE AMAZING ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER & CLAY and WONDER BOYS, I'd call THE FINAL SOLUTION a minor work. But one day, this novella might become a staple in high school curriculums, where it would communicate the beauty, charm, and pleasure in literature.And yes; I'm an old fud. But I did not like Chapter 10, where we get a bird's eye view of events. And, revise the title."
2,somewhat juvenile and disappointing,"Not anywhere near the caliber of Kavalier and Clay, or the Yiddish Policemen. Best part is the chapter written from the bird's point of view."
4,"A short, but quirkily satisfying tale","This is no CAVALIER AND CLAY, but THE FINAL SOLUTION is a great way to spend a couple of evenings with a talented author having fun with the ongoing experiment of telling stories in a different way."
2,Disappointing,"This was overwritten, and ""clever"" in the way that modern literary fiction is apt to be."
3,too slow for me,"I found this book difficult to read. Characters are not sympathetic, events plod along. My local bookseller said that people either like it or hate it. It was highly recommended by a member of my book club, and I have liked Chabon's earlier writing. I guess I fall into the ""hate it"" category."
2,not very interesting,"I haven't read the other two Holmes pastiches that came out this year, and I haven't even read any original Holmes, so maybe I am a bad judge, but the Holmes pastiche chapter in Zoran Zivkovic's The Fourth Circle was more interesting than this. I really enjoyed ""Kavalier and Clay"", but this book was dull and flat, and I did not care about any of the characters. The only thing I found to like was that one of the chapters was told from the parrot's point of view, but in the end the book just wasn't satisfying."
2,The Final Solution? - The Final Straw,"This is the first book that I have read by Michael Chabon and based upon my assessment of this book will not buy another. Although technically a fine writer, the plot of the book is threadbare, many of the characters shallow and the flow of the narrative spasmodic. The chief difficulty I have wih this novel is the palpable presence of the author on virtually every page, leaving me with the impression that the theme of the book was not to tell a story but rather to provide evidence of the author's ambition and literary prowess. Conan Doyle must have rolled over in his grave upon publication of this literary brick!"
5,A PHYSICAL mystery peo-ple!,"This is NOt a who done it, but it is waht is called a Physical mystery (I think thats wht my acting teacher called it) where the action takes place in the minds of the characters! This is very hard for most people to understand why is the parrot thinking? Where is the butler? Because in mysteries the butler always does it, you have to think, PEO_PLE!! Most people dont like this book because they dont UNDER_STAND it. I hope my erview helps.So, if you like old ladies who solve the case because the butler did it, then this book is NOT FOR YOU!"
1,Just not worth the time,"This is ""exquisite,"" as several other reviewers have said. It is skillfully done, it is clever. It is deliberately old fashioned.But I think a reader needs to ask: why write such a book? If this is entertaining, then so is the whimsy and cuteness in ""Murder, She Wrote"" or the delicate fake nostalgia in Merchant and Ivory films.Late in his life, someone asked Ezra Pound to write a preface to his first book of poems, published when he was young. The early book was called ""A lume spento"" -- the poems were pretentious, precious, and old fashioned. Pound knew it, can said they were ""stale cream puffs."" I know that Chabon writes in several different styles, but I am not going to read any of his other books. Why? Because if he thinks something this artificial and concocted is entertaining, then I do not trust his taste. He can't possibly be a writer for the twenty-first century."
3,Not Chabon's Best,"A diversion and that's about it. There are many of these Conan Doyle imitations, and this one is okay, especially for real fans of Doyle (and Chabon). Not Chabon's best."
4,The Old Man...,"The Final Solution finds Sherlock Holmes (never named, but always referred to as ""the old man"") an 89-year-old recluse who lives in the country and cares for nothing anymore except bee-keeping. Then, one day, a young boy with a parrot on his shoulder strolls into his life.This is a very modest story: the safety of the free world does not rest on the outcome. It does not rely on previous Sherlock Holmes literature: Dr. Watson and Lestrade are not here; we do not find out what happened to the old man since his retirement. Chabon's style is so distinctive, we always are aware that we are reading him and not Arthur Conan Doyle; but, as Chabon is one of my favourite writers, that is not a bad thing. However, he is true to the character: I am sure that he must have read all of the real Holmes stories and gives us valuable insight into his mind at the end of his life. This is an entertaining read and would interest any fan of Sherlock Holmes or Michael Chabon."
5,Soothing as honey,"I was sick when I listened to this on tape, the guy reading it on tape had a very soothing voice, It made me feel loads better listening to it.It is the story of an unnamed 89 year old famous detective who may or may not be Sherlock Holmes.He is deep in retirement, and keeps bees at his countryside cottage and stays away from people at all costs. Until one day ,he befriends amute Jewish refuge who has escaped the horrors of Germany with his African Grey Parrot stooped on his shoulder.Then there is a murder at the boarding house ,where his little friend is staying and his parrot is kidnapped ,our old detective comes out of his retirement to help ....It is a little slow and the writing is rather flowery, but you are used to that if you read alot of Michael Chabon. It is very captivating. And all the flowery writing makes it easy to imagine what the characters look like in ones head."
2,Maybe I just didn't get it,"Had this been my first exposure to Michael Chabon's work I'm not sure I'd read any more of his work. However I have read The Yiddish Policeman's Union and The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, so I'm willing to write this story off as a fluke.This read more like a writing exercise than an actual story. Can Chabon write a Sherlock Holmes story with out ever naming the character Sherlock Holmes? Yes, yes he can. Is there a point to not naming him Sherlock Holmes? Not that I could find.The mystery itself was okay, but nothing fantastic. I know Chabon can write good mysteries because Yiddish Policeman's Union was a very good book.This is not a book I would recommend."
4,More Than Pastiche; 3.5 Stars,"This short book, really a novella or novelette, is another example of Chabon's attempts to fuse popular fictional forms with serious literature. Chabon has tried this with hard-boiled detective fiction (The Yiddish Policemen's Union), alternative history (The Yiddish... also), historical adventure fiction (Gentlemen of the Road), and this Sherlock Holmes tale. Chabon is a talented writer but one of the defects of these efforts is that these books have not been very good by standards of these genres. The Yiddish Policemen's Union was neither a particularly good thriller nor a particularly imaginative alternate history. The Final Solution is the best of these efforts with good quality writing and character development, though the most interesting character is an African Grey Parrot, but a pretty pallid plot. It is clever, and Chabon obliquely explores themes of memory and sorrow in a good way, but its ultimately a failure."
3,A Wisp of a Novel,"As is true of MC's other novels, this one is brilliantly written. I am always happy to lose myself in MC's lush prose. He is a true craftsman of the language. And elsewhere he has proven himself, time and again, to be a master storyteller as well. Though I appreciate the conceit -- and the subtlety -- of TFS, however, I cannot rate it highly. It simply serves up too thin a gruel. To this reader, it read more like the prospectus for a much weightier novel. That said, there's a lot of wonderful stuff in TFS, not least of all an entire chapter written from the perspective of an African parrot. MC is a prodigiously talented writer. I look forward to reading anything and everything he brings out in future."
1,very disappointing,"Especially if you were hoping, like I was, for the same quality of character development and plot whimsy as Kavalier and Clay. Judging by the other reviews, I guess one either likes this book a lot, or not very much at all.These would be great characters if they had a chance to develop. Instead, they show up out of nowhere, even Holmes, and act out of motivations that are more redolent of pop psychology than anything else. Perhaps it is better as a screenplay than a book.The story has such a great historical and literary backdrop and I was very hopeful in the first few pages. However, it was a book I finished only out of grim determination than any deep interest in the plot or characters."
1,So Wanted To Love It!,"What a disappointment. This book misses every mark it tries to make. A humdrum read and puny mystery unworthy of N. Drew let alone S. Holmes. Plodded through it on the hope that the final pages would make it all worthwhile; they didn't. If you are looking for an engrossing read and crackerjack mystery, don't choose this one."
2,Pathetic,"I was excited to read this book as I am a huge fan of 'The Amazing Adventures of ...' I was so disappointed in this book. For such a brief book it took me a long time to read because it was much like force feeding yourself something you just hate. I would love to say that all the work resulted in some sort of reward in the end but it did not. The writing style is unnecessary for this brief story and the 'detection' part does not hold its weight. Unfortunately, I have to advise against reading this book."
2,Overwrought,"I'm a big Chabon fan and have read most if not all of his stuff. I loved Mysteries of Pittsburg and liked Adventures of Cavalier and Clay a lot. ""The Final Solution"" seems more deserving of a New Yorker article than a full publication. He's playing with the detective genre and formalizing his style - I get it. But to me it's like a jazz musician blowing fast and furious non-stop, showing us his chops but forgetting to give us some dynamics and contrast.Too much wordsmithing and fancy-pants writing here for me. I actually got 99 pages of the total 120 somehing pages, and I put it down. Ouch. It seems like Chabon needs to just let it flow sometimes and get out of his own head. The critics seem to love it, but this was totally unsatisfying for me.."
4,"""Customer Service is their number #1 Priority"" True.","From the start I had problems with the install. Angry, I emailed customer service. Twenty minutes later I have their tech guy Ken Haberman in an email exchange. We try everything. Nothing works. I'm exploding with anger in CAPS and !!!!!!!!!! Mr. Haberman remains upbeat and suggests I retype in the serial number because maybe I've input the letter B instead of the number 8. Due to complications from a brain tumor my mind does indeed play tricks on me. I would have never thought of this but Mr. Haberman did. Someone should give that guy a raise for taking all my anger and staying cool enough to find the solution. Turns out... I WAS the idiot. I'm eating crow now and LOVING my Movie Magic Screenwriter program. I would've given this program a perfect five stars but the online validation thing really should disappear. Otherwise, a PERFECT program for screenwriters, writers, and comes with excellant customer service and tech support!"
1,ILLINOIS RAILROAD MUSEUM,I find that this film spends more time with interviews than showing equipment. The meuseum has over 300 peaces of stock but only spent time mainly showing the FRISCO decopod plus the tape is produced in a slower speed which reduces the quality of the product.
3,Response to review by Ned Myddleton,"As the editor of a new, fully revised edition of this title that is currently in process, I would like to say that New Holland Publishers have been made fully aware of the errors contained in this book, and apologise sincerely to readers of the exisiting edition. The revised edition has been worked on throughly by Jack Jackson, the renowned author of numerous other diving books that have received 5-star reviews by Amazon readers, and shall be available in bookshops at the end of the year.I would also like to thank Ned Myddleton for his specific comments, and would like to assure him that these had been picked up on and that they have been corrected. However, if Ned would like to send any further corrections to myself (kate@nhpub.co.uk) then please do so over the next two weeks (until May 1).Kate Michell (Senior Editor, New Holland Publishers)"
1,Not impressed,"While I love Christmas music and like Glen Campbell, I thought this CD was uninspired. There's nothing ""wrong"" with the music or singing (except for wimping out on ""O Holy Night""), but there's nothing memorable in these recordings. They are high quality PLAIN, nothing innovative, nothing fresh, nothing even excitiing. Glen Campbell seems bored himself."
4,This album introduced Mary J. Blige to the World,"Although this movie came out in 1991, this is a classic. The movie introduced us to relative newcomer and now Oscar Winner Halle Berry. The soundtrack which will soon be a classic, introduced us to the vocal talents of a young unknown backup singer at Uptown Records named Mary J. Blige. The dance track on this album is by Jeff Redd who introduced Mary to Andre Harrell who was the head of Uptown records. Jeff Redd is also the individual who received the demo tape from Mary's stepfather on which Mary sang Anita Baker's ""Caught up in the Rapture"" at the Galleria Mall in White Plains, N.Y. The A&R person at Uptown who was assigned to work with Mary was Sean""P.Diddy"" Combs. Its amazing how history interconnects.The other tracks on this album are average. LLCool J, Stephanie Mills, Grand Puba, Jodeci, and Heavy D are the next quality tracks after Mary and Jeff. This will be a collector's item soon."
2,average but a few catchy tracks,"Jeff Redd's ""You called&Told Me"" was my cut. I dug that New Jack swing Groove. I dug me some New Jack Swing back in the day. that song was my cut. LL's ""Strictly Business"" was cool&Mary J.Bliege's ""you Remind me worked.stephanie Mill's cut ""I just want Love"" was cool,but after that it's downhill on the soundtrack still there is a few cuts&i still watch the movie."
5,A Great Find!,"A great collection of patterns that are easy to follow and offer several interesting variations for each project, plus ideas for adding your own personal embellishments, buttons, beads, etc. I also enjoyed the authors narratives on the ""art of knitting"" as well as the helpful hints and techniques. A must have for any knitter, beginner or experienced!"
5,"Easy techniques to seam, assemble, and block knit garments","Knitting basics and sweater creation titles are usually beyond novice-level skills: not so with Catherine Ham's 25 Gorgeous Sweaters, which encourages novices to use easy techniques to seam, assemble, and block knit garments. Plenty of professional tips and techniques are included in this book, which offers 25 diverse patterns designed for new knitters."
2,Old fashion styles.,"I bought this book based on the previous reviews. I was dissapointed in the fashion styles. I was not inspired with any of the patterns offered. I haven't tried any of the patterns, so in fairness of it all, I gave it two stars."
3,Cute story - needs editing,"I thought the idea for the story was cute, which is why I picked up this book. It was cute. It fits the romance novel format, so it's predictable but has enough little twists to keep it interesting, even when you can see how it's going to play out. The editing, however, drove me nuts. There are typos throughout the book that really need to be fixed. Without the typos, I would have given it four stars."
2,Why Fight It?,"I don't think there was any suspence in the story at all, it was just a matter of time until Jane/Jesse/Jill and Rob gave into the heat burning between them. Would they have been similarly attracted to each other if they had met anywhere less romantic? Say for instance if she caught him speeding? But good guy gets the girl in the end. What age was this written for teenagers?"
5,algo Critique,"the tome is excelled by only a few;one,perhaps,concerning the solutions to star material. Pete Duffett-Smith writes that one from Cambridge;though Jean Meeus is still very dependable."
5,Extremely Practical for Designing Astronomical Software,"I am an amateur astromer and amateur software designer. Meeus' book is absolutely invaluable for producing programs that require knowledge of the locations of the Sun, Moon and planets at any particular time. It's worth the price alone for the algorithms of Jupiter's natural satellites. The simple algorithm for lunar eclipses is amazing. I have written countless sub-routines and functions based on both large and small bits of data in Meeus' book. Thank you, Jean Meeus!"
5,excellent,This is the kind of music I love to listen to : a gibson les paul on one side and a fender stratocaster on the other. both playing though tube amps. this band rocks.Vintage classic rock recorded in the nineties!! learn how to play rock guitar from this album. like guns' roses appetite for destruction (slash in in one speaker and izzy in the other) but not as nasty.I wish I could find more music like this album.
5,So Hip It's Scary!,"What a great and unusual band! I've had the tape of this album for a long time, but just recently bought the CD. This is a really cool-sounding band, although they're not as heavy as most of the bands I like. ""Little Bones"" is a great song to crank up, and ""Long Time Running"" and ""Fiddler's Green"" are great ballads. The lyrics are similar to that of Bush, in that they probably mean something, but who's to say what? Nonetheless, it's a great and fun album to listen to. Recommended to fans of Live, Bush, and Our Lady Peace. Also, if you like this band, you should check out Caroline's Spine."
4,Great Album,i think this was oine the hips greatest productions....it has so many ...good songs that i can play over and over without getting tired of them!
3,Your Kit Car Assembly Manual,Okay for what the title says it is. (Assembly) Don't look for specific info on actually building from scratch.
3,Interesting format,"I was looking forward to this book as i thought the cd format was going to be helpful and will save trees, i found it to be a disappoinment, as there is just a lot of wasted space to make the book look larger than it is, a lot of pics could have fit two or more in a page, the letter type is way large and the informattion basic, however it might give you an inside into building your own car and help you decide if that is something you can do, or maybe leave to someone else. So in my opinion, buy it only if this is your first book and want some general information, but not if you really need an assambly manual, because it is not"
4,It's silly - it's supposed to be!,"It's low budget, campy, and involves cheerleaders. What do these 1-star raters expect? There's definately a lot of gore and while some of the effects aren't prime quality, well, it's not supposed to be. That's what makes it funny. I thought the cheerleaders were all hot, and the guy that runs the funeral parlor is insane.... and this title's name just takes it from there. if you're looking for a low budget, modern indy film that'll make you laugh and take you back to the days of those late 70s early 80s camp movies, this one's a good one."
1,i stopped it in the first 30 minutes,"yea...its bad, and doesn't have much redeeming factors about it either. An example: a guy takes his life with a gun and they use a Papier-Mché head as the dumby head that looks like something your younger bother made in kindergarden (it flashes fast, but not so fast you cant see it). Its bad."
2,Should Have Listened To The Guy Below...,"I was looking for some external speakers to go with my Apple Powerbook G4, and ended up choosing these. Having played a wide variety of music through these, and making endless adjustments to attempt to get the perfect sound out of them, I offer my opinion.They look great, I love the remote, set-up is easy, and the bass is more than adequate, but for the price, these speakers are severely lacking in mid-range. The high end sound is fairly crisp and clean, but there simply is not nearly enough mid-range. Everything the dude below says is absolutely true. For $50, I'd be happy with these, but not one dollar more. I'm already shopping for something else..."
4,"Good Sound, Great Look","Pros:-- Design-- Sound great, at high or low volumes-- Remote (nice to control volume and bass levels, and I like the line in and headphone ports on the remote)Con:-- Sub woofer size: At 12""h, 7""w, 10.5""d it is almost as big as my pc.Overall:These look great, sound great and take up only a small amount of space on my desk. They look really great next to my silver lcd (and would look just as well next to a white lcd, but probably not black)."
4,bulky,"sound quality is in line with the price, overall a good value. the woofer is a bit large and bulky."
3,Instructive for the beginner but terribly outdated. Be sure to supplement with better/more complete scholarship.,"Historically instructive but something this old (and therefore oblivious of countless important discoveries) should NOT be relied upon in any way beyond basic terms and concepts. For balance and perspective, supplement with Kurt Metzger et al.Of course, if you are looking for a monaural affirmation of your own presuppositions about mss. families and contempt for various modern Bible translations, restricting yourself to very narrow and obsolete sources like this one is exactly what you will want to do to make the world of scripture mss. simpler and a lot less work. Why deal with the complex real world when one can side with a particular position and pretend that all others have no merit?"
2,Difficult to program new stations,"I bought this based on reviews from others. The preprogramed stations don't work in my area (SF Bay Area). Depending on where I am in traveling, I need to change stations to reduce static. It is not easy to program or dial in a new station on the fly."
4,Decent device,"I have used this device in the city and out on the expressway. I have had good luck in both places. Every once in a while, the device will go static for a flash and then the music is back. When using the device for an hour on the drive to work downtown, it only went static for a second, did not have any problems in downtown Philadelphia. Good device for the price, love that I can use it with a CD player, tape recorder, or any device that has a headphone jack. Better then the Monster device that I had for my ipod which only worked on the ipod."
3,Be careful that it only works in cars,"I couldn't find it in product description, but it turns out that it can only be powered by the car cigarette lights"
4,Weird head,"I got this alongside the Saber set - and out of the 4 mini characters, archer's head seems to be oddly proportioned."
4,Archer/Rin Palm Figures,"The Archer/Rin Palm Scenery figure set consists of two minature figures and quite a few accessories. The figures are of high quality and considerably cute, making an excellent addition to any TYPE-MOON fans' collection. The Archer face scuplt is better than most as the character typically gets low quality sculpts in favour of the girls.Accessories include multiple alternate arms for Archer, Astoth, Kansho, Byakuya, Caldabolg II, and Archer's bow.You can mix and match the weapon/item accessories to give Archer the soup ladel if you have both sets."
4,Good for newly initiated Priest/esses of Orisha Spirituality,"Inspirational book especially for the newly initiated young Santo Iyawos as well as the Santero/as menores. This is the personal story of Baba Ifa Karade. The book is also good for those interested in a personal account of a priest's first step in an Ancient religion, as well it is interesting for African Americans who are searching for a spiritual belief system from the African continent. It is a thin book that will take a day or two to read, but informative, truthful, soulful and entertaining."
3,"On its own, fine, but The Best Recipe is more comprehensive","""How To Make Pizza"" contains a handful of recipes for pizza crust variants (deep dish, thin), but its content is largely subsumed by The Best Recipe (ASIN 0936184388) or ""The America's Test Kitchen Cookbook"" (ASIN 093618454X). Unless one found How to Make Pizza used, I would encourage you to consider The Best Recipe instead.The Cooks Illustrated series is unsurpassed for methodologies and the depth of why certain things work and not. From this, one builds a foundation of cooking which can be infinitely extended. Think of these books as the Consumer Reports of cooking, or as they like to say, ""We baked 37 different pizza crusts so you don't have to."""
1,Don't waste your time or money!,Poor writing and evidently doesn't know too much about Texas history. Had to force my way to the end. Don't waste your time or money.
5,The Theory of The Heavens,"This three volume set is precious to me. Each time I dip into these books, I find new treasures. Since Galileo, astronomy has become an observational science, but, as Neugebauer observes: ""Ancient Astronomy was overwhelmingly mathematical astronomy."" He shows us how the ancients took the few and uncertain observations they had and worked out such things as the relative longitudes of Carthage and Arbela, the secne of Alexander's great victory over Darius III in 331 BC, (Ptolemy's work), the distance to the Moon (Hipparchus' work), and the length of the year.If you want to know what the ancients knew, and how they knew it, this is the place to look. Specialists will plow through these books. Those of us with an interest in ancient science will find browsing these volumes rewarding. And, if you get hooked, there are copies on Amazon."
1,Never worked!,I purchased this item for my new xyron print runner. The item did not work straight out of the package. Returning this item immediately.
4,"Giant size,small edition.","I would have given 5 stars but,I had only seen one copy of this book and it was MUCH LARGER.Now I know what ""Regular format references."
5,This is a 10 star book at least! Well worth the price.,"This long awaited work is an absolutely essential read for Andy Warhol fans and anyone fascinated by popular culture and iconography. Andy Warhol Giant Size is in fact a giant of a book weighing nearly 15 pounds and containing 2,000 photos, film stills, newspaper and magazine articles, letters, even receipts. Detailing his life from childhood poverty in Pennsylvania , through his evolving style and transformation into one of the most enduring artistic and cultural figures in New York and in the art work as a whole, this book provides rare access into the mans world. Not a re-hash, this book provides a wealth of information previously unseen including rare photos and text from friends, artists, photographers, and fans of the period."
5,WOW! A beautiful tribute,"Fantastic pictorial book...worth every penny. If you are a fan of Warhol, this is the book to own. Great prints of Andy's work from the 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s - including rare prints. You won't be disappointed - it is all here. The dimensions are impressive at 17"" x 13"" x 2 1/2"", and it makes for a beautiful coffee table book that you will be proud to display. The pictures are sharp, both in color and b&w, and many are full-page, including pics of Andy and Edie. Outstanding!"
5,Very Impressive. Great coffee table book!,"While I admit I have not read this book cover to cover yet, it is a great book to own if you are a fan of pop culture, POP art, or any of the characters from the Factory. There is a lot of biographical text, but far more pictures and insight into the art, so it is really quite fascinating. I am a huge fan of pop culture during the sixties and of Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick. My husband is not. He loves this book, too, though as it quite nice for the coffee table, and a conversation piece. It provides exposure to the world of Andy Warhol and the Factory without the overt homoerotic tone that some of the other books have. I would definitely recommend this book."
3,Good for Killing Alot of Space,"The main attraction of ""Giant Size"" is just that it is physically giant sized. I have the book set on one of my display cases and is just way to cumbersome to read. It's chronological layout of Warhol's life and work seem very accurate even though I have not been able to read this book rather a good skimming. Interesting documents of his life are displayed throughout including photos of his childhood.I recommend this book for anyone who needs an enormous coffee table book, or is a fan of Modern Art or just loves Andrew Warhola."
4,This novel reads like a lecture disguised as fiction,"To really appreciate this novel one needs to have a basic understanding of the author's life and philosophies. Many of the events narrated herein are based on actual experineces from Crowley's colourful life, with people like poet Willian Butler Yeats disguised as the Black magician, Gates.Behind the veil of a less than impressive story, Crowley pushes home his philosophy, as well as revealing many interesting insights into the world of Magick, as the author practiced it.Stephen Mackintosh"
3,"nice presentation, but not really focus on main topic.","Generally the presentation is good, nice graphic and menu transitions. They are very entertaining. However, the whole video is talking about some principles of microphones, signal path, how to connect those gears etc. I thought this video suppose to show us on how to set up our home studio. It should cover topics such as installing diffuser, sound absorber, how to choose materials and so on."
3,A workmanlike effort from Phillip Adams,"This book may be Australian, but the phenomenon of the shockjock is universal; sadly, bigotry disguised as populism disguised as'normalcy' will probably never go out of style.In _Talkback_, Phillip Adams takes one of his typically self-satisfied looks at a few prime examples from Australian radio, including the impossibly obnoxious Stan Zemanek, the credibility-free John Laws, and with a special mention for Ron Casey, who had a horrifying on-air hissy fit about Nokia sponsoring the rugby - because he thought they were Japanes.Most of the book is plain transcripts, a wise decision on Adams' part, and one which allows the truly hateful nature of the radio people to shine. It's very depressing, but then, evidence of society at large's complete backwardness and bigotry always is."
5,It works!,"My kittens were having accidents with traditional litter, so i tried this stuff. It's not cheap, but it works. In fact I left a bag out where the kitties could get to it, and they tore the bag open and spilled it on the floor. I don't know if they put catnip in this stuff or what, but the kittens really love it."
1,"amazon shipping issues, mediocre product","I would not recommend ordering this item from amazon. The bag came with a large hole in it, and there was litter all over the inside of the box.I have an old cat who seems to choose to not use the litter box about 20% of the time. She instead chooses the bathtub, closet, etc. We changed to this litter and an uncovered litterbox. There has been some improvement, possibly from the switch to an uncovered box, but this litter has certainly not fixed the problem or been a quick fix. The switch to this litter simply has not prevented our cat from using other places around the apartment to relieve herself.It scoops well, but so do litters that cost half as much (or less)."
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered this product because my vet said it should work. It was my sisters cat and she would not use the litter box. We used the whole bag in a weeks time and the cat still would not use the litter box. I should have ask for a refund, but I lost the receipt. For what it cost, don't bother!"
1,Didn't attract,"I bought this brand specifically for my daughter's cat who has a real litterbox issue. Not only does the problem cat not use the box with this litter, the other cats will not use it either. It does have a money-back guarantee, but since I wasn't particularly hopeful that it would cure this cat, I never considered pursuing that avenue."
2,NOT FLUSHABLE,Seemed like this would work for me but it was not until after I opened it did I realize that it was not flushable. I am toilet training my cat so I only can use flushable litter. This should have been a part of the product discription.
4,Best Brand for Us,"Well for our cats at least. :) It is expensive, but it is what my cats love above the rest. The non-attract type also works and they don't mind using that but for my cat with issues, I have to add attraction stuff so I just go for this type. This is all of our favorite brands. I wish they had this type in a larger size and that the price was a little more cost effective for us (we have 3 cats), but as long as I can, I'll pay for what works best."
4,"Less time spent outside the box, but pricey for herbs!","This litter appears to work! Whereas my old girl of 17 years would generally ALWAYS do her business outside the box, this has cut that down to about 1/4 of what it had been, and I suspect it's due to missing a scoop. I'm on week 3 and this seems to still be working - I will be buying more today and refilling. I am using an oversize box with the 20 lbs version, and scoop everyday, sometimes twice a day. It appears to last about 3 weeks-ish for 2 indoor cats. Just wish it wasn't so expensive, when I know it's a mixture of herbs I could probably figure out to make my own attractant!"
2,Not really impressed,"I tried this litter in 3 different types of litter boxes:Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Large, Green and Beige, an automatic self cleaning boxPetsafe Simply Clean Continuous-Clean Litter Box, and a standard open flat pan litter box. Clumping is only mediocre, it smells, and it is HEAVY. Gummed up the Petsafe mechanism, stayed too wet in the standard flat box, and didn't hold the clumps very well in the Omega Paw box. I much preferArm and Hammer Super Scoop Clumping Unscented Cat Litterbecause the clumps dry faster, it's much lighter in weight, and isn't sticky or stinky. I won't be buying this one again."
2,unimpressed,"while it might have helped a bit with some bad potty behaviors... the dusty nature of this product makes it not worth the hassle.it becomes airborne as soon as you pour it... simply, a mess!"
4,Great litter,"This has worked very well for my 2 huge Ragdoll boys. It clumps perfectly, is the least dusty of all the litters I've tried, and they've never gone outside of the box. I just tried their Precious Cat for multi cat households and it worked just as well, but it looks to be a couple of dollars more per bag, so I'll stick with whatever is the least expensive. Cost is my only complaint about this product---I think it's way overpriced."
5,Diamond Hoops,Excellent quality and price. These earrings were a gift for my mother and she loves them. The diamonds are easily visible and we did not notice any carbon markings within the stones -- the stones were surprisingly very clear -- I think I got lucky with this set!! I compared the price and diamond clarity with other online jewelers and feel confident that I made the right decision to purchase them from Amazon.
4,"Nice price, Nice Chairs","Definetly pleased with these chairs, so much so I ordered another pair after receiving the first set. Would recommend to anyone, very well made basic chairs."
1,You get what you pay for,"The style is nice but the quality is just terrible. The boxes they were shipped in looked like they took 5 different ones and pieced them together. The first thing I saw when I opened the first of two boxes was a complete crack across the back of one chair. Not small but huge and obvious so this tells me the shipper/seller just put in whatever not caring if it was good or not. I thought for an occassional use chairs these would suit but as the title says, ""You get what you pay for"".Amazon was great at the return process. We were able to print return labels, taped up the boxes they were shipped in and UPS took care of the rest. The only thing we were out was a few pennies for gas. Once items were received we were given an immediate refund. Thank you Amazon.I do however think Amazon should look at the quality of shipping from these senders considering they back them with Amazon Prime."
2,Kitchen chairs,"These chairs are very pretty, but because you have to put them together yourself (and I mean almost every piece is separate-except the back) they feel like they aren't very sturdy. My boyfriend and I put 4 of these chairs together. I love the look of them, but not the feel once they are put together. I wish I had gone with a more expensive chair (in the hopes of it being put together already and feeling more sturdy)"
3,Enjoyable stories but not much else,"Siegel has written a chapter on nearly very film he was involved in. From his days doing Montage sequences for some classic films (i.e. The Raging Twenties) to getting his first directors gig from the wary studio mogols.Siegel is an entertaining writer but you feel as if your not getting the full picture from him. Details are skipped over and lost. Some infamous people emerge (i.e. Sam Peckinpah, Ronald Regan, etc.) but other stuff is neglected. For example, I don't think Siegel even mentions John Milius' contribution to Dirty Harry. Peckinpah's trouble with studio brass is hardly covered but there is some interesting stuff on the making of Charley Varrick and The Shootist.Theres not much information for those interested in film making, but for light reading I would recomend the book but just don't expect too much."
