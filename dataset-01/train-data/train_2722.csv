5,LOVE this pillow !!!!!!!!,"I had a crick in my neck. actually; a pinched neve. I purchase this cylinder pillow as my main sleep pillow. after 3 weeks, it worked to restore original neck curve.. This is a nice pillow. The outer cover which has an appearance of an inner cover.TWO COMPLAINTS.1.There are no ""sleep pillow covers"" to be found. I have to divide and modify s regular pillow case. (still working on that2ond.THE shipping was free, but it took 13 days. Nobody was in a rush. Never has free shipping so slow. The wrap up: DUMPED ALL MY OTHER PILLOWS . PERFECT FOR ME AND A CPAP MACHINE .edit..10/2011 I HAVE HAD OVER A YEAR,AND STILL LOVE IT."
1,Terrible pillow. Do not buy.,"Beware of the fake positive reviews for this pillow. This pillow is one of the worst purchases we have ever made in our lives. We needed a pillow for cervical support, so we purchased this pillow. Huge mistake. After less than 2 months, this pillow is as flat as a piece of paper. No support at all. Absolutely terrible. Now it's going right in the trash, since we can't return it at this point. Don't waste your money and don't learn the hard way like we did. AVOID THIS PILLOW."
2,not all it seems,This Bucky is actually filled with some grain other than buckwheat. It flattens out quickly and therefore does not provide the hoped for support.
5,Like the Millet husks better than Buckwheat husks,"I haven't stopped using this pillow since the day I received it.At first glance, I was afraid that it would be a bit too small in diameter, but that certainly was not the case.I tend to have neck stiffness if I use a regular pillow of almost any other style. This bolster has been a blessing."
4,Very nice relaxing tea,I enjoy drinking cammomile tea in the evening and this is a very nice version of pure camomile (I prefer not to have it mixed with other ingredients). Purchasing via Amazon's subsribe and save is a very cost-effective way to stock up on great tea.
5,Very healthy,"Camomile tea is one of the best health teas. Very flavorful and very beneficial. I enjoy mixing it with my green tea for a soothing evening drink,"
5,delicious,"I like this tea very much. I ran out of it and am now suffering through a brand that supposedly has been around for over 40 years but to me it's bitter, harsh and not palatable.I will stick with twinnings, it has a relaxing aroma, is highly palatable and smells divine.I read somewhere that chamomile softens skin, maybe I'll use that other brand to bathe in."
3,The Red Woolen Blanket,"The book shows a good transition from a newborn with her first blanket to how the blanket withers with age as the child grows-up. The main character in this book is able to let go of her blanket by the time she is ready for her first day at school. But is also sneaks in a minor character who refuses to give up his blanket, wearing it as a disguise at school. This book has enough simple words for a child who is begining to learn how to read. Yet ofers some challenging words that will expand the vocabulary knowledge of the child."
4,Great Umbrella,This umbrella got a work out with lots of wind rain bugs leaves ETC. It has held up in spite of being lift and dropped x1.
3,"Not bad, but mildew stain started in the first summer","I didn't think we had a particularly wet summer, but the light color of the umbrella showed mildew stain in the first season. We have since bought a cover. The tilt mechanism does not function, Otherwise, it is large and gives good coverage."
5,Great Umbrella,"This Umbrella is great, I ordered a second one after I got the first. Just what I needed, sometimes you know what you want, but just can not find it, at Amazon you find it and if you are a PRIME member you get it fast!!"
3,patio umbrellas by strathwood,"I purchaseed 2 cream colored ones. They are nice, but I find them hard to tilt. It tilts from the top but requires 3 steps to tilt it, when the sun moves. The first, is to climb under the table to loosen it from the base and the next step is to turn the unbrella and tilt it and then back under the table to screw it into the base once again."
4,"Great price, but doesn't coordinate well","I purchased this umbrella to accompany the Strathwood Falkner Chaise Lounges. The Chaise is a pewter aluminum color, I was disappointed that the umbrella pole and arms are brown. It does not coordinate at all, with the other items in the Falkner line. I ended up spaying the brown parts black, so it works for us now. The mechanism and the quality seems OK for the great price, so all-in-all, I would buy it again!"
1,Not happy,I bought this model because it is supposed to tilt. The tilt mechanism is there but it won't engage. The only instructions that came with it are how to put the poles together. No manufacturer contact information is available. The info available takes you back to Amazon. Perhaps this one is defective.
1,stay away,"I purchase this item back on May 28, 2010, it work find until August 3, 2011 when I when to crank the umbrella open the cord broke inside and now its useless. I only got to use the umbrella for 8 months all together. This item is not worth the high price if it only will last a little over a year. stay away."
4,Charger tower gave me a charge,"I had worn out the charger stump that came with my Braun toothbrush set about five years ago. The stump had been fine and I would have replaced it, but I could not find it for sale. So, finding only the tower, I took a chance. That worked fine. For the past month, the tower has recharged my toothbrush in good time. May it give me five years' service!"
5,Toothbrush Charger,"The charger works great. We originally purchased 2 toothbrushes, but only received 1 charger. We now have 2."
5,compact and easy to use,Bought this as a replacement for the one I already had. I charges quickly and has worked great!!! I would recommend.
5,Super Happy!!,We were extremely pleased that we were able to buy this base and not have to purchase a whole new dental system. The order came as promised and obviously brand new. Working great. Thank you!!
5,Replacement works perfectly,"We were in Europe and I managed to burn out the charger that came with the toothbrush. Searched the number of the electric toothbrush we have, found it in the Amazon posting, we order it, it arrived and we can now brush our teeth again.The few days we had to use the non-electric toothbrush made those days seem a lot longer.Thank you Amazon."
2,generally unedifying,"I strongly recommend perusing a printed copy of this text before deciding upon purchase. A large body of the text consists of mathematical proofs of mostly elementary properties of Hilbert space. Despite the historic significance of the book in establishing a rigorous foundation for the math underlying QM, it is not a good text for developing either a conceptual or functional understanding of modern mathematical techniques in QM."
1,Full Disclosure,The USB connection between this camera and the computer does not work it you are using NT 4.0 as your operating system. You should make this VERY clear in your product description. Not everyone runs the popular consumer operating systems.
1,No USB Support on Windows 98 Upgraded PC's,"I was initially delighted with this camera until I tried to connect it to the USB port on my Windows 98 PC. Evidently Canon will only support versions of Windows 98 installed by the PC manufacturer. If you have an older PC, and upgraded to Windows 98 from Windows 95, you are out of luck. The only way to download pictures from the S-100, is to buy a seperate flash card reader. Besides being an additional hidden expense, based on comments about these flash card readers from other reviewers, there is a strong liklihood that these will also not work. If you own an older PC, with an upgraded version of Windows 98, skip this Camera until Canon gets their act together."
5,Excelent,"Just Excelent. But I would like more optical zoom, the capacity of manual focus, and the versatility of using lens."
5,"Big features, small package!","I have had the Sony MVC FD73 and was disappointed at the quality of my pictures. I just recieved the Powershot S100 for Christmas and what a difference!! When compared to other digital options, we found this one to offer more bang for your buck. You do need at least a 32MB card, but the camera is great!"
2,Batteries that came with it are bad,"I haven't been able to use the camera, because the batteries that came with it, as apackage (one of the main reason I purchaced this particular product) If thebatteries were old and dead, why include them in the package? I feel like I was dupped."
4,"pics a little dark,","I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures. The size is tiny, which I love. We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging). Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 ""adjust levels"" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.Speaking of software, the program that came with the camera 2 years ago was horrible, but they've since upgraded to a program that's decent which you can download from the Canon website (and likely they provide the latest software with current purchases--I'm not sure).The normal zoom works well, but when you get into the ""digital zoom,"" everything gets fuzzy--both the viewscreen and the actual pictures are big blurs. So I just don't use that feature.Overall, it's a decent buy."
4,"All in all, a great investment","...I just used it at a Christmas party over the weekend. Took about 150 shots, and used 50 of them. The only reason this camera gets a 4 out of 5 stars is the picture quality. Since I was taking photos outside at night as well as under a number of lighting conditions inside I had to touch up just about every picture that I ended up keeping- the Adobe PhotoEditor software they include is a Godsend. Granted, my picture quality problems are probably because I'm a such a novice, but it was problematic. I've read other reviews where people have complained about the flash (or lack thereof) on this camera, and how it affects the picture quality, and I'd agree.With that said, I've gotten more use out of this camera in the last few days than I have with just about any camera before. The fact that I can put this in my pocket without looking like I'm trying to smuggle a brick is a big plus. Not to mention all the benefits that go along with digital cameras in general."
3,metal casing does not imply durability,"The metal casing is a thin sub millimiter shellwhich does not make this camera more durable.In fact, the metal casing transfers more shock tothe internal components such the lens drivethread alignment.Tolerances are extremely tight for the Canon S110and S10/20/30 series cameras."
1,Broken dreams.,"After reading the many reviews, I purchased this camera. I was able to use it for 1 day. Then, suddenly it would no longer take pictures. Canon tech support was no help-they suggested turning the camera on and off. Their only solution was to send it to the factory for repair. I returned the camera to Amazon-who could not exchange it."
1,A very good camera UNTIL ....,"I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked ! I then realized a major design flaw. All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional. When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !"
1,If it ins't new. Don't buy it!,"Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was ""refurbished"" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for ""refurbished"" items is less than 6 months."
2,Almost loved this camera,"I really liked this camera when I first started using it--easy to use, great form factor. Pictures were of excellent quality. After using it for a week it wouldn't power up. An error message was displayed on the screen---E18. Canon service told me I had to mail it back to have it fixed.... I have been very happy with this camera---so far."
1,Very poor picture quality,"I was expecting picture quality in the same range as a 35 mm film camera, but my pictures are so grainny and blurred that I can hardly make out objects features even on the best 4 x 6 glossy paper. I am currently trying to work with Canon Technical Support, but so far I have only gotten unhelpful generalities from them.Ron Stamey"
3,Great Camera for daylight.... BUT...,"Even though it's a great camera, I wont give it the 5 stars because of the poor quality of fotographs in low light situations, the flash the camera has is too small and does nort has enough light to get good quality pictures at night. Eventhough, if you will take pictures traveling, it's great, but I dont take it with less than 32 Megs on the memory stick, 8 is not enough."
4,"Update to Feb 7 Review, see below.","It now appears that the reason that the Canon S100 would not download to my Dell Computer had more to do with the computer than the S100. Dell has E-mailed a fix which worked perfectly. Please ""pull"" my review dated February 7th. I don't think there is any need to post this followup. Thanks, Craig in Houston."
3,Now what did I do with this camera,I think I ended up selling this camera on eBay for parts. The button on top broke and I think It had some type of error. Overall it was a great little camera that fit right into your pocket.
3,Smaller not always better,"I don't disagree that this camera is a good one. I've been a Canon afficionado for some years. However, I have found the ELPH series can be difficult to use because of their small size. I would not give this as a gift to someone who might have difficulty seeing the tiny symbols on the camera body, or to someone with large hands who might have trouble adjusting the micro-sized buttons to set the camera. The larger Canons still have the edge over these mini-sizes, especially in quality of photos."
5,Refined and polished look and feel,"First let me say this watch is available for around $675-700 if you shop around. That being said this is a first class product. Every edge is smooth and polished, the dial is detailed and easy to get lost in. The clasping system is first rate and secure.It feels substantial in hand but seems to disappear on the wrist. Keeps amazingly accurate time, but isn't flashy or shouting look at me while doing it. Understated and simple, yet everything about it is first class.Worth the investment."
3,"Better than most, but lacking","As with many anime soundtracks that fall flat on their faces when separated from the anime itself, Key the Metal Idol seems so subtle and so very 'background' music that it nearly evaporates into the background completely.There are moments during this cd that are emotionally moving, but for most soundtrack fans I think it will leave you somewhat hungry for more.Except that there isn't any.Better than most, but clearly not at the same level as the soundtracks from: Cowboy Bebop (all of them), HALO, Mechwarrior-4, Diablo-2, Mononoke, etc."
4,Very clear telling of the story,"I'm not sure why the other reviews on this DVD are so bad. This is NOT the series with Charleton Heston and the boy on the camel. This series was produced by a Mormon company with input from Christian denominations so that they could also be a useful tool for all family who want to teach their children the Bible. This movie is true to Scripture (obviously with some artistic license to make it a half hour, but it brings the story to life and doesn't change the story at all). It's not up to today's animation standards, but my young children aren't such connoisseurs that they didn't enjoy watching it. Maybe they just don't watch enough television or movies. I appreciate this whole series, and I think this DVD is a valuable resource for teaching my children about God's love."
2,Unbiblical,"We own several of the nest family videos and even though I know they use their imagination to create a 30 minute DVD, I wish they stayed close to the biblical account as much as possible. The most beautiful part about the story of the prodigal son is that the Father had been waiting for his son every day. In this version of the story, the dog is the first one to see the son coming in the distance and not the father. It completely ruined a wonderful story! I was very disappointed. We don't watch this video at our home anymore."
5,Loving this book,"I loved this book but I must admit that I would have found it confusing if I had read it before the other books in the series. I adore the story of Esme and Sebastion, and love the way that Stephen gives Bea back a sense of worth. Totally recommend this series but strongly suggest you read the books in order."
2,Old man and young girl romance,"The hero is in his mid fourties, the heroine is 20 or 23 yrs old (writer forgot what age, mentioned 2 different ages. I am not into old men going with young girls, reminds me too much of pedophilia. Hero is boring and straight laced and heroine is a tart, so are the other women. There is a difference between sexy and vulgar.I am not even finishing this book and will toss the other book I ordered from same writer. Instead try some of the Harlequin Historicals, their writers may not be as well known, but know how to write a story."
2,Don't waste your $6.99--There are better books,"What a disappointment. I have read other Eloise James books and liked them much better. Lame plot, lame characters--I could barely stand to read the whole thing, but I felt after having bought the book, I should make myself finish it. There's no rapport with the characters and not enough background to empathize with them. The only character you really understand is Esme, Lady Rawlings, and in theory, she's a subplot. Pick out something else, if you're tempted to buy this one."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Why the back cover touts this as Beatrix and Stephen's story I do not know, since it seemed Esme and Sabastian were the main characters. Personally, I have a hard time with a 20 year age difference between hero and heroine and that put a damper on the whole thing right off the bat. Moreover, there was virtually no romantic interaction between the supposed main characters, though Stephen was surely hot for the immature behaving Bea. Did not like this story, but have enjoyed others from Eloisa James."
3,A Wild Pursuit,"I stumbled across this novel by complete accident and I still don't know how it got to my office. I would have never thought of buying it to be honest. At first I was really shocked. I mean the characters would still be shocking even if they lived in the 21 st century, let alone regency England! However I found myself enjoying the story, or rather stories, as they progressed. If you are looking for a typical regency romance where the rake falls in love with an innocent yet willful woman, this is definitely not the book for you. The characters are completely unconventional and as far as can be from perfect which makes their exchanges witty, fun and completely refreshing. I still prefer conventional romances where the hero and heroine share the kind of true love that lasts forever but I would not mind reading Ms. James's novels every once in a while."
4,Enjoyable if you've read the series,"I really liked this book so I was surprised to see such bad reviews. After going through some of them, I can see now that people who have actually read the series are those who are able to appreciate this story more.Many of the characters in this book first made their appearance in ""Duchess in Love"". I think if you read that book first, you'll enjoy this one more.I admit that I didn't really find Eloisa James all that interesting when I first read one of her books (Taming of the Duke) but now I'm a convert. Her the writing is excellent; characters are very refreshing -- no one too perfect and each with their own idiosyncrasies; the interlacing plots engaging; and the characters' exchanges witty and real. The whole plot reminded me of Shakespeare comedy.I'm a great fan of series books but unlike others (for instance, Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series, which I LOVE)these don't seem to do well as standalones. Read the series, and you may enjoy them as much as I did."
2,Disappointed in sound quality,"After reading the great reviews, I was really looking forward to using this small clock radio in my bathroom. I guess the reception was ok but I was very disappointed in the sound quality. I have a couple of inexpensive, small portable radios with much better sound but I was looking for a radio with a clock as well. I am returning the radio."
2,Radio is a disappointment,This radio doesn't live up to other Sangean products in both construction and performance. Sensitivity and selectivity on all bands is very disappointing.
2,Weak on AM,"Bought this mainly for AM reception. I live between NY and Phildelphia, so I am on the fringes of reception for some stations. Only does well on very strong signals. Would only recommend this radio if you are very close to the stations you want to hear. I can barely get WFAN and I live in Central NJ!"
4,Excellent Reception in a Small Package,"I think previous reviewers nail the pluses (small size, digital tuning and excellent reception) and minuses (price and mediocre speaker) for this unit.I am very satisfied since this radio brings in my favorite jazz station clearly whereas I'd had very poor experiences with two other radios used in the same environment - a good example of paying more to get more.If the speaker sound really starts to bother me, I can always use the integral ear buds."
3,Do not purchase the Sony AC-E30A power supply!,"I bought this radio and it sounds great but, upon plugging in the Sony AC-E30A power supply, (which Amazon lists as a recommended accessory for the Sangean DT-220V radio), it did not work. I checked the polarity and there it was, the radio requires 3 volt tip-negative and the power supply is tip-positive. Oops! Way to go Amazon, big mistake! I am returning both the radio and power supply."
3,Malfunction in the DT-220V radio,"One of the pre-set buttons did not work properly. Regardless ofthe AM station that is entered into the radio on button #3, itchanges to 750AM. I returned the radio and asked that a new onebe sent to me. The new radio has the same defect. The result isthat that are four pre-set buttons, and not five."
2,Nice fradio BUT AM reception all static,"I was looking for an AM/FM radio with digital select buttons, which this radio was advertised as. When it arrived I followed directions and the clock and FM worked fine. BUT, all I received was static on the AM stations. I could not pick up any local radio stations, and found my joy level dropped quickly. I have several other pocket radios but they all use earphones, whereas the DT-220A uses an external speaker as well as earphones. For now its back to the pocket radios I have if I want to listen to AM stations. I had to return this item, and would only buy it from a local store where I could test it before I bought it."
2,already breaking down,"I bought this radio in 6/29/10 and its now 12/4/10, it's already breaking down. My time keeps flashing and it says it's low on power (which it's not, because the batteries are new). Other times it register's no power, so all my presets are reset, quite annoying. Most other reviews are correct on sound and reception, that's why I bought it, just didn't think it would break down so soon. Of course it only has a 90 day warranty. I would really suggest something else, that's more durable."
4,portable radio,I have owned many portable radios. the sangean 220v by far is superior to all them in frequency separation and ease of use. I do like the convenience of the ear bugs and find the memory to be quite usefull for my frequently used frequencies.
3,Great Portable With Excellant T.V. Reception!,"I ordered this radio a month a go from Amazon.com and couldn't believe how small and lite it is! I carry this thing around a lot. The A.M. is fair, the F.M. is average, but the T.V. reception is superior! My Sony walkman also has T.V. reception. This Sangean picks up T.V. stations the walkman can'teven detect. For a radio with great T.V. reception get the Sangean DT 220!"
5,Great little radio,Love this product. I can listen to TV or radio and not bother anyone because of the retractable earphones.
1,shoddy manufacture,"While the product was still in warranty, the antenna broke. I called Sangean. They gave me a hard time and tried to put me, rather than the product, at fault. When I insisted that the product had neither been dropped nor abused, they agreed to send me a new antenna -- it never arrived.The warranty period just ended. within 1 week the built in earphones stopped working. If this shoddy product is typical of Sangean, I would NOT buy another of their products."
2,I can't listen to this,"Let's be honest, the speaker in this thing sounds terrible. It's so shrill and scratchy that AM stations sound hissy and off-frequency, and FM sounds like a toy. Maybe it sounds better through headphones but if you're going to listen to it that way then you might as well get a DT-110 which is a great headphone-only radio.On top of the bad sound, the plastic case on this one looks really cheap.On the positive side, it has a sensitive tuner and good features. I especially liked the alarm clock feature. If only Sangean could have made this one sound as good as their SG-622 it would have been a keeper but I can't stand to listen to it so it's going back."
4,Bedside Companion,"Good sound , both voice and music. Presets are big help when used in dark after retiring."
2,Compare to Radio Shack Model 12-898,"Although the RS receiver doesn't have TV reception (who cares),it is 1/2 the price, PLL digital, 3"" speaker, DX/LOC switch, andprobably much better quality..."
5,Great Calculator,This is the perfect type of calculator for the desktop. It is easy to read and use.
1,Disappointed,I received this tank very damaged. Some of the damage was painted over as if this was a previously used tank. I was very angry to receive this tank in the condition it was in. Dealing with Amazon has been helpful. Dealing with AutoPartsWay has been an Extremely Difficult Task. They sent the package without any packing material to protect the tank from damage. They expect you to send the damaged product back to them protected with money out of your pocket. The return should be on them for any damaged products. I will never order from AutoPartsWay again due to the poor service they provided.
1,amazon-wrong parts,"amazon sent me a tank for a honda with a totaly wrong part number, then did not have the right one so i had to buy a tank from rock auto -it worked great"
2,DEEP RAZOR REVIEW,"LOud, obnoxious new band formed by ex Hoaxster D. Pedroza. The riffs are monotnous, the vocals screeching and the music painfully loud. Gone are the progressive moments. Gone are the interesting melodic sounds. What happened Pesntch? Guess he wanted to be a clone band of Sabbath and Purple."
1,FALLS OFF and TERRIBLE---image TOO SMALL,"i have a lexus RX350, their smallest SUV, baby is pretty much right behind me and image in mirror is SO SMALL i cant make out any detail of the baby!"
1,Too violent,"The book starts out well enough. It's playful and light with nice illustrations. The last half of the book however is not suitable for children IMHO. In the last half of the book we see the characters engage in combat. Some are taken prisoner / kidnapped and held against their will. While the story has a happy ending after that, the situation is resolved by violence (though the violence here happens ""off screen"", the before and after illustrations leave little doubt as to what happened in between). Is using violence to solve problems really the message we want to be sending to our children?"
4,Inspired and enjoyable,"Unlike nearly everyone else who has reviewed this album, I had never heard of Stephen or Claudia. I had been a fan of a New Wave band called Figures On A Beach, whose keyboard player was Christopher Ewen. When I saw his name on Memories Of Love I decided to give it a listen. Glad I did! His instrumental and compositional prowess has only grown better with this new outing. Buy this album and listen to some amazing synth arrangements rarely heard in contemporary American pop music. Its a dark, atmospheric treat, this disc."
5,"Hilariously brilliant, catchy, magnificent!","Stephen Merritt never fails to impress--especially with his hilarious lyrics. With song titles like ""Death Opened A Boutique,"" chorus lines like ""Blond Adonis on the endless autobahn,"" and lyrics like ""all of our dreams are dying--of overdoses/all of our plans are lying--in ten car road wrecks/there's no use even trying--becuase it's hopeless!"" WHO COULD RESIST!"
2,This album bores me to laughter,"The voices on these folks! The man sounds like a depressed child with a head cold, and the woman sounds like somebody dressed up in a mermaid cosume somewhere in Disney Land. I don't know what else to say. The instruments are too light and fluffy, mostly done by a machine, and the whole thing just sounds like a bad, cheesy eighties album. Sort of like Annie Lennox meets Captain Kangaroo. I know 80's rock is making a whacky come back, but guys, listen to the album again and try not to chuckle. It's pretty hard."
4,texas blues for beer and barbecue lovers,"slip this greasy pickle slice in your cd player and behold, barbecue sauce and beer pour from your speakers as you are transported in some indeterminate blues-time (1950s? 1980s, according to the menu) to a texas roadhouse with a live band! a friendly texan with high hair, two-tone shoes, and a ten-hole harp in his mouth wraps his arm around you and bids you welcome, handing you extra napkins to sop up the excess hair oil and barbecue sauce you will encounter. this is james ""icepick"" harman, and he proceeds to squonk some cold harp for your pleasure while backed up by a tangy blues guitar. the menu says these are previously unreleased songs from the '80s, but who's to date that old-fashioned texas sound? long as harman's around, these blues are here to stay, too, and that's fine by me."
3,a good read!,every story is enlightening! it helps u stay in a good mood after reading! it teaches u about love! and yes...i like it very much!
5,Thanks.,"Thanks for this book, i love road to avonlea, the show, and i wanted this book too. thanks again.Jacque Manso"
1,Horrible product.,"This apron deteriorated after just 2 uses. Used for waitressing, this apron got all pilly from simply being worn around my waist. HUGE waste of money and time."
5,3-D castle,"What a wonderful ""book"". This three-dimensional medieval castle was a delight to both my daughters, age 2 and 5. It is very sturdy, with amazing details. My 5 year old was delighted to find special ""surprises"" throughout the castle. It is perfect for travel and packs so easy. Please note that this is not a book per se, but more of a ""dollhouse"". There are cut-out dragons, princes, princesses and other fun accessories. My daughters will play for hours with this castle."
5,A Great Book on Ways to Deal with Menapause,"This is a great book for woman who want to find a more natural way to deal with the problems of menapause.It's very detailed, interesting and easy to read. Thank you Dr. Seibel."
2,This Book Did Not Tell All....,"I only give this book 2 stars because it does not give the true account of Mohommad's life. He had sex with children - that is a fact. Read the Hadith, it plainly states that mohammed had sex with girls at least 7-8 years old. If he were alive today he would be arrested and put in jail. I would then call mohammed a pedophile pervert.Why dont we hear the truth about islam and not this watered down version?"
4,Critical view of the prophet and Islam,"This is a book that a devout Muslim, if he bothered to read it, would rail against, because it treats the founder of Islam as nothing more than a mortal, although a very complicated one. I read it during the years I lived in Morocco and I found it an invaluable tool for understanding Islam from the inside, and also understanding how Muslims view people of other religions. I don't think it is the most balanced account of the prophet's life you'll find, but it's one of the best researched ones and it doesn't pull any punches."
2,Good product when it works,"Under most conditions, a great product. Fast, relatively affordable drive, compact media, convenient. But you have to consider replacement costs when you buy. I've had two of them fail -- one SCSI, one IDE -- both within weeks of the warranty ending (i.e. 13-15 months after purchase). Castlewood's fee to repair these things is $108 per drive, which is only [slightly] less than a brand new one! Factor in that you get a ...disc included when you buy a new drive, and basically it's a wash -- you might as well just buy a new drive! Competitor Iomega's track record isn't so great either, so I'm sticking with the Orb, but be careful -- the cost of this drive might be ...per year."
1,good concept- horrible product,"In theory, this is an excellent product- However, it is horrible. It is the reliability of the data storage that is the killer. Once you put data on a disk, you have to cross your fingers and hope that it hasn't become corrupted."
5,Computer Memory,"Computer was running very slow. With this 1 GB of memory, it is running like it did when it was new."
4,great product,Memory worked exactly as described. no problems with the product. greatly improved computer response time and program loading issues quickly.
5,Best computer purchase ever,This RAM restored my nine year old computer's speed. It runs 5-6 times faster now and start up is super fast. Easy to install and the best price anywhere.
5,Did the job,"I bought this RAM for my parents aging PC that they don't want to get rid of yet. I installed it, and there was an immediate performance difference. Applications respond in a timelier manner and it eliminated a sluggishness that the PC experienced now and then. It has been installed in the PC for about 4 months now with no errors or problems. I should note that the PC is running Win XP Home and it previously had 512MB RAM."
1,RAM not detected,"I read complaints about PNY's RAM reliability, but I placed my faith in PNY and made a purchase. The problem: the RAM module could not be detected by the computer.I've performed multiple RAM upgrades in the past, and all of them were successful prior to this one. I've also triple-checked that this RAM model is compatible with my notebook, and according to Crucial.com and PNY's own configurator, my exact notebook model is compatible (not just the model family).I also checked for dust. I swapped slot places for the existing/new RAM modules, and only the original RAM was detected. And when I attempted to use only the new PNY RAM module, the computer rebooted and rebooted and rebooted at the BIOS stage.The RAM module could be defective, but I'm steering away from PNY after this experience."
5,Make sure it fits your PC,What can you say about memory? As long as it wotks with your motherboard life is good and this is a good price.
4,Good for the price,this item helped speed up my computer. it got here sooner than i thought it would and its helped me surf the web and write reviews faster.
5,5 stars,"i ordered on tuesday i got my items thursday..item's where like new n work great...i have breathed some new life into my old computer..this $15.00 purchase,saved me aleast 700 on a new pc..believe it or not..well im happy LOL"
1,rip off,"I bought the Kingston version from this company and they crashed my computer. I thought the Ram was new but it was used garbage . I am pretty techie , and this was a big disappointment . I don't see how Amazon lets them sell anything on here . I did a Ram test on this product and it didn't pass one time. I use the same brand except 2 512mbs and they worked perfect , but this company must not test there product . :/ thanks for nothing . I recommend doing a full system backup before installing this companies products"
4,Memory Module,"When shopping for PNY did not know how good it was, but I proved to be a good manufacturer, I am satisfied with its performance, although a bit expensive but all in order."
1,defective out of the package,After I installed the ram the comutper's graphis would fail. I bought a new stick from an other vvendor with out any issues.
1,Not a SODIMM,"Just another unhappy customer who received DIMM's (desktop) instead of SODIMM's (laptop) memory. I should have read the other comments before ordering. Alerted Amazon to the mistake, hopefully they'll fix the item description before another customer orders the wrong memory. Waiting for my refund."
1,Burned in more way than one,"Immediately after installing this RAM, the RAM burned not only it's self, but the motherboard as well.I had bought this brand of RAM before through Newegg and was happy with the results then. Perhaps it was because it was a different kind of RAM.Sad to say I am out A LOT here because I bought this, and I cannot afford to replace either one of these at this time.Avoid this product if you can't afford the risk."
1,PNY Memory chip did not work with my machine,Could'nt get to work. Right chip specs my Dell Demension 2400 just wouldn't take it. Called PNY and they told me to return and buy a different manufacture memory chip. I returned and received my money back. I bought another brand and it worked fine. Excellent service from Amazon.
5,"Very good, but 2 of these won't work well on XP","I got one of these 1GB Ram sticks for my really old PC. Originally it had 256mb of Ram, then 512mb. But I finally made it 1GB. Anyways, the results were fantastic. It worked without any hassle and it makes the computer much more responsive.Then I got another stick since my PC had 2 slots. The 2nd stick did nothing at all. The speed is exactly the same as 1GB. So i'm going to upgrade my PC to Vista soon. I've heard XP can only use 1GB of Ram.So, moral of the story. If you have XP, get one of these. If you have Vista, get 2 sticks.By the way, I wanted to get a second stick because I do a lot of recording for my video games on that particular PC. These sticks work very nicely with my Hauppauge HD PVR. Much less problems with more Ram :)"
2,Good return service but that was about it.,"I ordered two 1gb ram sticks to fully upgrade and old computer and they were supposed to be brand new, however this was not the case. When I inserted one of the ram sticks the computer wouldn't even boot and I knew something wasn't right when I looked at the other stick because it was missing the warranty sticker on the side of it but I plugged it in anyway. Turns out that one stick didn't work at all and the other stick was only 512mb so at this point I could confirm that neither of these sticks were new. I really like amazon but this was very disappointing but I was able to return them for a refund without any hassle which is good. If you need to by ram I would say do it from one of the other more trusted computer part stores that are out there."
4,PC2700 Compatible,The PC2700 333 MHz memory is actually PC3200 400MHz. I don't know why MD1024SD1-333 and MD1024SD1-400 are offered as being different when they are both the same item. PC3200 is compatible with PC2700 and PC2100 but differs in that it can run at 400MHz if your computer can operate at that speed. My system uses PC2700 so PC3200 gives me nothing more than 1GB at 333MHz. I would rather have the PC2700 DDR SDRAM but in the end it doesn't really matter. I'm keeping it.
4,Perfect Accessory to an Electric Fireplace,"The newer electric fireplaces are beautiful, but most/all are silent. When played through speakers tucked behind or alongside ours, this CD completed the illusion with authentic crackles and hiss. Band 1 builds slowly, mimicking lighting the fire, and ends with a full blaze. Band 2 continues the blaze, and then ends with a dying fire. We set ours to ""repeat"" and enjoy it all evening."
5,"Cozy, woodfire.","I really enjoy this CD! It is very relaxing and puts me in mind of many happy memories spent in front of the fire. The back cover describes it as: ""The sound of the crackling flames. It is as if you, staring into the burning wood, sit in front of an imaginary hearth. Warm your hands and thoughts to the woodfire sound of this album."" Everything about this CD is just right. It isn't distracting, just calm and peaceful, crackling and popping white noise. Highly recommended!"
5,Perfect,"Great item and quick shipping. The item is perfect for the Crosley multi player that I own, the color is a perfect match."
3,Crosley Entertainment Cabinet,"Although the cabinet is supposed to be the same color as the songwriter, the color was slightly off. I was also disappointed that the cabinet pieces did not fit as well as they should have when I put it together."
5,Great addition to our home,This cabinet goes perfect with our new decorating theme and matches the CD/cassette player we purchased. It was easy to put together and looks great in our livingroom.
4,Great for the price,"My husband and I ordered this for a 4-in-1 Crosley player we bought at Target. It matches beautifully and we get so many compliments on both pieces. The only problem we had is that the hinge inside the top shelf was broken off on one side...but we just took it all the way off and it still works with just the magnetic latch. It looks great in our dining room, where we spend most of our time entertaining...love it!"
5,Nice cabinet,This is very nice cabinet to put our Crosley vintage 60's style record player on. Goes together real easy and sturdy. Holds all our vinyls. I had to find screws for to put the knobs on because they weren't in the box. Other than that I'm very pleased with my purchase.
3,Stereo Cabinet,Came as advertised. Very flimsy construction - had to brace it. Now being used as a bedside tabloe.
2,cheap appearance,The unit is functional and easy to assemble. The overall appearance is low quality except for the door. The veneer is paper thin and many edges are painted particle board. I expected solid wood legs.
3,"Nice looking, but,...","The cabinet looks nice, but it was a bit hard to put together. I couldn't get the last 2 ""screws"" inserted, and needed my husband's help. Also, the nails that attach a small block to the drop down drawer's hinge, are too short. Because of this, the block will have to be glued to keep it attached."
5,A great review for AP boards,"This text is very concise compared with Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease. Both are excellent, but this ""smaller"" book actually has everything you need for the general pathology part of the written AP boards. I am specifically referring to chapters 1-9 with 10 and 11. It needs to be read with near total comprehension, but the color graphics are excellent aids. All other systemic pathology topics should be covered in a surgical pathology text, of course."
3,Not worth it,This text is not worth purchasing if you have previous edition.I found very little difference between this text and the previus one.
5,"`The Bowls, The Bowls!'","Seriously, these `bowl' recordings by Karma Moffett really click with me. They are beautifully done and have an incredible amount of dimension for stereo recordings. I own/have sampled other recordings of ""bowls,"" but none of them sound as alive as this recording and Moffett's similarly titledGolden BowlsThese two recordings differ from each other in that ""Golden Bowls"" tends to center more on deep/low tones, and ""Golden Bowls of Compassion"" has a more even mix of high/low tones right from the start.Both recordings are just incredible sounding on systems that have a subwoofer, though.I'd like to see or read just what hardware they used to make these recordings and how they placed the mics - they are that amazing!"
5,Take a nap.,"Put this baby on, preferably with headphones, and take a nap. Sheer blissful la la land."
3,Not enough about the glass,"An interesting book, but not entirely what I expected. While the discussion of Roman glass in relation to daily Roman life was interesting, I was hoping for more about the UPenn exhibition that was the source of much of the material. Fleming's more recent book, Roman Glass: Reflections on Cultural Change, might be more the exhibition catalog that I was looking for. If you're new to Roman glass, however, this would probably be a good starting point."
5,"This is the big, in-it's-original-montypython-box, rabbit","on time and in excellent condition~ my girlfriends is a monty python fan and she fell in love with it. this is the only worthy version of the toy; the big rabbit! there are some other sellers telling you to buy the rabbit, but they don't tell you it is the small version. definitely would buy again from this seller"
2,Abnormally short sleeves,"I bought the medium jacket for my son who is 5'8"" and very slim. The jacket fits me. I am almost 5'2"" and a size 2 in ladies. Even then, the sleeves come three inches short of my wrist. The jacket looks nice otherwise with lots of pull strings and pockets.. I don't know how waterproof it is since we never wore it out in the rain. I'm returning it."
3,could have been designed better,"Well for 19 bucks its fun. If it lay flat against the helmet it would be better. The makers should make button holes to feed the base of the suction cups through THEN sew them in place so you dont get that unsightly gap where attached. The overall and from a distance image is very cool...up close,....could be done better. I have had this thing on my helmet at an average speed of 100 mph 115 miles a day, hasnt budged once. I plan on buying another for my sons dirtbike helmet. Works great for visibility in the rear view mirror of the driver in front of me and that makes it great for safety as well."
4,Mud Puddle,"A terrific read aloud for spring/mud season each year. The children are usually giggling with each page as it is read. Pausing adds extra effect when the audience tries to remember what comes next.... ""Jule Ann buttoned up clean new pants..."" ends up ""completely all over muddy"" every time! (But Mom, a mud puddle jumped on me.) Have fun with it! Robert Munsch is a favorite read aloud author."
5,Classic Munsch - MUD PUDDLE,"This paperback book is a fun, Fun, FUN read aloud! Fairly predictable text, my students (SpEd) were able to predict (a critical skill) fairly well. Munsch writes books kids enjoy reading several times. A great addition to your (growing) Munsch collection! A great buy!"
3,So Munsch fun (with picture caveat),"There are so many picture books that celebrate the wonder of snow, but we don't get much of that here in Texas. I wanted a book that celebrates the weather we do get. Mud Puddle does that wonderfully. Some children do seem to be sought out by mud puddles. The only downside of the book are the two pictures of the naked main character in the bathtub. I'm in a very conservative community. The pictures were ""disruptive"" for a group read aloud. They were unnecessary and detract from the main point of the story. I wish the illustrator had used more mud and bubbles to conceal more. :( I won't choose this one as a read aloud any more."
2,We love Mud Puddle,"My preschool classes have all loved MUD PUDDLE. The repetition with in the story is great. We love to have an excuse to shout, ""Hey, Mud Puddle."" We've even made up actions to go with the bathing and dressing portions of the story. I love this author and this is by far my favorite of his stories."
2,Mixed up.,"This was a good transaction. Prompt shipping. I ordered the wrong game. Chainz 2 is more fun and is a little faster paced so you don't fall asleep. That wasn't the sellers fault. Would not be afraid to buy from them again, though."
5,Awesome for the price,"Yes I bought this on sale...but the shoe is really well made, the leather soft and very comfortable and my daughter feet lean toward the chubby end. They go with everything and your little girl will fall in love with them..."
4,The enchantment of Babar,"A truly intriguing and engaging series of stories for a toddler. My granddaughter is 5 years old and is fascinated by the elephant-possibilities of society, meeting, marriage, children and responsibilities for a kingdom. The illustrations are reassuring and surprising.I love reading the stories to her, my important, however, is her delight at watching the careful involvement of Babar and Celeste with their children.A toddler will not look for political implications or issues of ""colonization,"" the pleasure of an unusual and gentle story ( I have to edit out some of the attacks) is what most fascinates and reassures."
5,Great!,I liked listening all about Babar's adventures when I was small and now I can let French kids experience it too!
5,Great product,I love these proflex wrist support its very comfortable and gets the job done. I would highly recommend this to anyone that need support for there wrist.
4,A Helpful Guide for Non-professionals,"I believe that the information contained in this book can be of help to those like myself who do not possess great athletic skill or streetwise combat experience.(Naturally, I couldn't venture out to test Mr. MacYoung's advice in the real world, hence the ""can be"".)Also, the author's outrageous sense of humor, found in other works of his that I've read, make the book worthwhile regardless of what one decides to do with his suggested techniques. Lastly, these moves are explained in a simplified, easily understandable way, which I personally find very helpful."
3,Meh.,"Had some interesting anecdotes and information regarding the effect of blunt force trauma on certain parts of the human anatomy, but for the most part this book was slightly less informative than hanging out with a juvenile corrections officer. This book is a poor substitute for training (or at the very least some live demonstrations), and too little information to be of use to anyone who has experience in this area.As with most books on this subject, you're much better off putting the money toward some Krav Maga lessons."
3,"Excellent social psychology, but...","The best and most valuable thing this book provides, like much of McYoung's writing, is insight into the psychology of people who provoke and/or engage in streetfights. In this respect, his books fill a unique niche. His actual self-defense instruction is sketchy, with very few clear illustrations.The downside: you do have to plow through the author's testosterone-induced rambling and often blustering prose, which is usually entertaining but at times a little tiring.Still not as good as Geoff Thompson's books on street survival, though."
5,Info that saves Law Enforcement lives,"Marc Macyoung is a product of the streets and as a Cop working those ""streets"", I can tell you the info Macyoung gives in this book can save any Cop's life. I know, one of the techniques in this book saved mine! Macyoung shows techniques that are simple but effective designed to put the bad guy down quick. He discusses legal aspects. I can see that Macyoung is well versed in ""verbal judo"". He knows talking is much better than fighting in the long haul. His war stories are entertaining but make a point. This book should be required reading in every Police, Correction, and Probation Officer Academy in the United States. This is an excellent book not only for law enforcement but the average citizen that wants to avoid situation where he or she could get hurt."
4,Great tips if you have a left handed child,I bought several books about lefties when we realized our daughter would be left handed. This book gave us some great insights into her world and we have used the tips in the book. We have also used it to help her teachers understand and help her to cope with being left in a right handed would.
5,Very informative,"As a right handed parent of two left handed children, this book was extremely informative. Not only did it offer practical tips from any left handed person's point of view, but it had medical research/opinions to bolster the information given. I never would have thought about power tools as a potential safety issue if not for this book. And the information about sides of the brain, hooking v. not hooking, and slight increase in possibility of other issues was both informative and comforting. After reading this, I know a bit more than most left handed people I know and than my sons' teachers about what being left handed can entail. While there is a lot that is unknown, this book simultaneously opens the mind to potential issues and eases the worries that parents naturally have. Recommended for any parent of a leftie!"
5,Great resource,I used this in a presentation and it gives good inforation on the Triangle Shirt factory fire. My professor is now going out to purchase it to use in the class as a resource.
3,Bars are good.,"Step Bars are really good and were very Easy to install with no drilling. The only problem I had is thqat everywhere I found these online it says they are for the quad cab Dodge ram 1500. Since this is the Dodge I have ever owned. I did not realize that the 2001 Dodge Ram 1500 had 2 different quad cabs.. These were listed as the steps for the Quad cab, but there is only one step pad. I later learned that these were for the 2 door extended cab. Not the 4 door quad cab like I have. Did not learn that there was a difference until after I had already installed them and could not return them. I am now stuck with the wrong ones on my truck"
3,Little small for a Desktop,"I was looking for a calculator to use at home in place of my handheld one. I wanted a Desktop calculator so I can enter the numbers without looking at the calculator. Unfortunately, although the keys are larger than the handheld, they are really to small to be considered a Desktop."
3,good,it was smaller then I thought it would be but overall was satisfied with the purschase and would buy again if bigger
3,Requires a lot of light,"I purchased this without paying attention to the fact that it is only solar powered - does not have a battery back up. It requires a lot of light to use. ---- a lot of time it is on but I can't read the screen. I like the layout of the calculator and would like to be able to use it more but because my apartment does not have a lot of natural light nor do I keep it lit up like an office would be I often cannot use it, especially in the area that I study in."
3,It needs a well lit room,"This is a great looking calculator and a nicely sized small desktop unit. I bought it for home use. The problem is that it is solar powered only and only under bright light conditions will it work. At home, the calculator will not work or barely display unless directly under a light.Update 11/04/12. I took it to the office and under standard office light, it works perfectly fine. The digits on the display are dark and crisp. I moved my rating to 3 stars. If it worked better under less than ideal lighting, I would rate it a 5."
2,Low light feature is misleading,I'm disappointed in this calculator. I purchased it because I needed a profit manager calculator and its description says that it operates even in low light conditions. It does not work unless I have a really bright light over it or natural sunlight.
2,Buzzing sound when using headphones,"The sound card works fine when just using speakers, but there is a buzzing sound when using headphones. You can mostly drown out the buzzing when audio is playing, but it's quite obnoxious when there is silence. If it wasn't for this issue I would have given it 5 stars. Installed easily on Windows 7 32bit and 64bit."
2,Wrong size,"I purchased this necklace along with the same exact necklace but black pearls. They came from the same shipper, received on the same day. The black pearls were perfect and the correct size ordered. The white pearls were way off in size. I was really disappointed as they were very pretty. I would order them again if I could be guaranteed the correct size would show up. Very careless on the shippers end."
5,Good Product,I bought this to download Windows 8 Consumer Preview and burn on this DVD. I was able to do it smoothly without any issues. Good Product !
2,this really is a book about nothing,"halfway up a mountain, neither fully awake or totally asleep. this is the state of modern western advaita and wayne is a perfect example of it.the uninvolved, distant realisation he is describing is a stage, a mark on the road to awakening, that the ten ox-herding pictures in zen both go beyond and fully complete.see, there is no return to the market in wayne's teaching, no deeper understanding of the world as 'that'. so if you stop at the zero point, where wayne suggests you fall into vacancy, you miss brahman AS the world and ultimately miss the whole damn point.so i would suggest you have a more careful and considered look at ramana before you settle for the shallows here, considering how the core and point of wayne's whole teaching is just a push towards greater depth when the understanding is more mature."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed and expected a lot more from this video. It shows only one race for this great horse and more on the trainer and owner than the horse. Plus the DVD runs barely 15 minutes. If you are expecting to see a lot more about this horse and a lot more races showing her at her best this is not the DVD to buy.
5,GREAT for Homeschoolers!,"Sequential spelling will set you and your child on the right road to spelling with a no hassle, no preparation, no testing approach to spelling. I can't say enough for this series. EVERYONE I turn on to this product thanks me profusely for the referral. 25 words a day, 5 lists a week, 15 minutes average - no reviewing, no memorizing. The series is set up for spellers with dyslexia, but works like a charm for all of us. Words are learned using word building - not the same as word families. Sample pages are available on their website. The purchase of the blank workbooks are a must and they are cheap - available through the company. They are set up in a way to put 3 lists to a page, but pages alternate so prior lists are not available for peeping eyes!"
4,"Pictorial Guide to Fun, Creative and Challenging Writing","Read the book just like a magazine. Seeing & Writing is packed with stunning images including cartoons, posters, news captions, studio portraits, studio arts and illustrations. The title is pretty self-explanatory. Seeing and writing: The book encourages us to see, to examine, to observe, to scrutize, to pay attention to small details and so to inspire a more complete and fun writing experience. The book also adopts pieces that leave us agape, in a way that we can re-discover how we could write about an even occurs in a nick of time as a small frog being swallowed by a bug-eater. You will be amazed at how detailed, descriptive, lively some of the selections found in the book. Re-discover our life experience, re-discover our writing. Write like we have never written before. See & Writing is truly inspiring."
5,A Van Sweden Classic,Landscape architect Van Sweden's description of his signature process and approach for harmonious gardens immerses us in a new dimension of garden design. This book is a valuable tool for virtually any garden lover or garden designer -- whether transforming a blank slate or just reviving a tired garden. Van Sweden shows us the importance of understanding the underlying architecture of our gardens.
4,Review of CIT300,The quality of this product surpassed my expectations. The range is excellent. Very satisfied.
2,review,"it works fine but, no volume controls...burst out ur ear sometimes and doesn't work without computer"
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MAC,"A friend has recommended me this article.I ckeck with a BEST BUY STORE to see if it was compatible with my MAC computer.Positive response.I bought it, AND when I received it, it WAS NOT COMPTABIBLE WITH MAC.Nothing on the Linksys web indicated that it was not.I RETURNED IT TO AMAZON ON MARCH 14,2007 IN SINCE THEN... NO ANSWER.I'M STILL WAITING FOR MY REFUND.....SO I'M NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH THAT BAD BAD BAD SERVICE FROM LINKSYS AND AMAZON.THAT'S WHY I'M RATTING ZERO -0 STAR"
5,"Maybe not the latest version, but definitely worth the money!!","Since Linksys CIT400 made its debut, this version of CIT300 just marked down the price. I got it from amazon for only $24. With this price, I am totally satisfied with its quality. The sound effect is very good. I called overseas a lot, and my friends cannot tell I was using a skype phone, 'cuz the quality was just as good as land lines."
1,Functionality missing. Linksys customer service clueless.,Dialing from the dialpad on the handset is not possible. Many people on the internet have posted this issue and I should have researched better. I work in Research and Development for information systems so am no newbie. Linksys Customer Service reading from the cue cards was pleasant but not helpful. Tier 2 support suggested that the user 'cannot' dial numbers from the handset directly but can only use names from the Skype 'Contacts' list. I called BS on that statement and they said 'Oh Well'.
5,Fabulous Summer Meals!,"This is my favorite summertime cookbook. When the weather turns warm and the garden is in full swing, this is the book to have. Every recipe I've made from this book has been excellent. There are delicious combinations and helpful comments throughout. The recipes are not difficult and feature many common, easy-to-find ingredients. I also love the lighthearted sketches. WE LOVE Salad Suppers!!ps-and don't worry, not every salad is ""lettuce-based"". Many include beans, rice, pasta, and cabbages."
2,"Not enough memory, slugish data upload","As good as the GPS 5 is overall, I am very disapointed by its memory capacity and the slugishness of maps transfer. Basically, if you live in a major city like Washington, LA or NY, forget about it. I am from DC and in my case, the 18MB built-in memory can barely hold enough mapping data to cover the city inside the beltway area. You can of course unload and load new maps but that is a tedious and slow process. There is no way to just update the map set currently loaded in the unit. Everytime you want to add to or modify the map set, you have to start over and load it from scratch. As an example, for the DC area, it takes over 1 hour to load a decent map set. Uploading map data through a serial connection is way too slow. If only Garmin had added a memory card to this unit with a USB interface. This would have made it much more usable....."
2,Great when I don't have to send it in for repair.,I have owned 3 different garmin gps units. The GPS V is great when it is working but it has just broken for the second time (won't power on at all) so I have to send it back to Garmin for repair. The last time I sent it to them for repair I had to send it to them twice before they actually repaired it.
4,"close, but could be so much better","The GPS works well and sets up pretty easy. But you have to havd an Internet connection, and preferably a high speed one to get it up and running.Two obvious flaws:Whats with the Serial connection? Garmin hasn't heard of USB Ports? Moving maps around takes 20 - 30 minutes to download, only do it before you go to bed.Also, when 48mg chips are available for less than $... why is the unit limited to 20mg memory? There really is no reason for this unit to have 50% of the United States available on it as opposed to a half a state which is all you get with the unexpandable memory available with the unit.Other wise the unit is really pretty good. Small size makes it easy to carry, and the cigerette adapter lets you run it in a car and not worry about the battery. Also, the unit can see satelites even when its on the front seat."
2,horrible item,"I just bought the item for 3 months and initially it works Ok, but it refused to receive any signal later and I have to send it back."
5,Exelent,This is one of the very good books of Vibrations The diferent topics and it`s presentation is exelent And each chapter is full of good examples. I can advise to read it.
3,EPIC SCI-FI MANHWA,"I liked Armageddon 1, and things get more mysterious and secretive as Um-ji and He-Sung learn the truth about mysterious transfer student, Mari Jang. Why is it ALWAYS the mysterious transfer student, anyway?The plot and action pick up considerably as now we have Matrix like guys in suits after He-sung. And the discovery of a mansion which is said to be Mari's ""home."" How does it all relate is still the big question. While the plot seems to stretch a little, I guess that's to be expected in such a long story. There are a lot of questions I'm waiting for answers to, but since Armageddon 3 isn't out yet, I suppose I'll have to wait."
3,Mixed Bag,"There are some great, hard-to-find songs in here -- Lionel Hampton's ""Lavender Coffin"" for instance. ""Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit The Ball"" is historically relevant. But others aren't quite what I was expecting. ""Cole Slaw"" is an instrumental-only piece by Frank Culley, so if you're looking for the humorous version that all the local swing DJ's play here in Seattle, you won't find it in this collection!"
1,Can not make it work.,"I wanted to use this as a backup device. However, when I copy files to it I always get a message that the transfer is not working and the files are not recoverable. Two disks insist that they are write protected. I have not been able to find that helps on the Castlewood site. This is the external USB 2.2 G drive"
4,Works fine for me-great alternative to Zip disks!,"I don't know what everyone is complaining about below. I haven't had one problem. I emailed their customer service dept when I first bought mine with an install question and they responded back quickly with good information. I admit, I tend to be more tech savvy than most people, but it's as easy to install as a Zip drive-in fact easier now that I think about it. Orb is a great alternative to the tedious process of switching zip disks during a long backup."
5,Little Plays for Little People,The book is excellent. The plays are funny and the parts easy to learn. The words don't need to be exact for the stories to delight. I used it with first graders and they loved it!
2,Anonymous Sender is confusing,I originally bought this book in 1996 and put it aside.Recently I was reorganizing my book supply and againencountered it. I tried to read it again and it is just notwell organized. It has many different characters frommany different dates and trying to understand how theyall fit together to make the story understandable is noeasy task.Michael McCowell is trying to be enigmatic and suspenceful like Len Deighton but it is not an easy thing to do.I finally gave up and read the last chapter and put the book aside. This is his first published work and I look forwardto seeing how another effort might better succeed.
1,Still waiting to receive it!,"First they sent the wrong one, acknowledged it and sent paper work to return with promise to resend the correct lamp. 4 weeks later and 3 emails have resulted in empty promises. Not good serivce here!"
3,havent use it yet,"bought it for a project, but i have not use it yet. the quality looks weak but i dont know, i will find out when i put then to use."
4,Different color and design,"Although very similar, the tools I received weren't quite the same as shown here. Also, they were dark red in color--not orange. Otherwise, they seem to be made well and should last."
3,"Useful, but should come with window crank removal tool","These tools were great for prying off pieces of trim in my car. However, there are other sets similar to this one on amazon that include a window crank removal tool. If you are taking off door panels with mechanical cranks you will need that tool."
5,Perfect,I got these tools to remove the car interior. It works perfectly and is scratch proof. The material is excellent. The price is amazing low for its quality. I am glad that I found these tools.
5,great addition to my tool box,this came in handy when I was working on my truck it make a clean job of removing panel's to access my radio
4,As good as the Honda OEM tools,Do not buy the OEM version of these tools as they are too expensive. I used these to install illuminated door seals on my 2013 Accord. Not impossible to remove the parts without these tools but you better buy plenty of replacement fasteners if you don't use them. I still broke one of the fasteners using the tools.
4,Does the trick for a fraction of the local price,"Hi,I bought this for installing new speakers in my German car. Since in the past I've broken plastic fastening hardware when trying to access dash and door locations, this seemed like a good investment. It has been.BTW, I only give 5 stars for products that god would be proud to use, so don't hold it against this set of ""5 pc. No-Scratch Tools for Removing Fastener & Molding"". For all I know, God has the cash to pay people to install his car stereo. And I hear it's a pretty bitchin' system. Even Satan once called 911 on a Saturday night to complain about how loud the subwoofers were."
5,The perfect tools for removing interior panels and trim,"These tools do exactly what they are designed for. They are made from a strong, but flexible plastic, so you can apply enough force to get fasteners in your car's interior to release without breaking them. There is enough variety of sizes and shapes to enable you to release most any fastener without breaking or scratching your car's interior."
4,No Scratch Tools,I ordered these for my work where we needed to remove bezels from very high end medical devices. The techs were killing themselves trying to pry them off with their fingers. These tools worked out great. They are rugged and do not scratch the paint on the magnesium housing where the bezel sits. Ordering was easy and they arrived quickly as the company that sells them is located nearby.
3,Just so-so quality,"You can definitely bend these tools without a lot of effort and the edges can scratch and otherwise damage trim if you're not careful. Once the edge is damaged, the tool may do more harm than good."
2,plastic not strong enough,"I would not buy this again. The plastic tips because white and broke off during completely normal use. You need a harder plastic than this to actually pry your car speaker covers or trip apart. I basically did get it to work, but these kit pieces were one time use only!"
1,Not good quality,Purchased this kit to remove interior trim in an 08 accord. The tools are plastic & not at all durable. Several either bent immediately & weren't useable or they completely broke.
3,Plastic seems stiff,"These don't feel like quality trim tools to me, but they will do the job with scratching the hell out of the interior. Huge variety of edges and points to tackle most trim fasters. I prefer the smaller 3 tools, but i can see a use for the larger tools on bigger panels. Worth the money if you do a lot of interior work."
5,I wish I had these years ago,Simple and outstanding. Makes very quick work of pulling panels from my Ford F-250. No more ruining your panels with screwdrivers!
5,Easily Pays For Itself,"If you have ever tried to pull off automotive trim pieces using metal (such as a screwdriver) then you know the damage it can cause. Plus, a screwdriver or a credit card or some other tool is just not the right tool for the job. I used this kit to pull trim and replace stereos in both my cars today: BMW & Toyota. They came in handy for both. Without this kit, I don't think I could have got the BMW done without screwing something up. Super handy tools to have if you're type of person to mess around with the interior of your vehicle."
4,Work well but a little flimsy,"I do all of my own maintenance and repair on my vehicles so a set of these is a nice addition to the toolbox.The do work well on most panel mounts but sometimes they are a little too flexible and you can't get enough leverage at the right angle unless you reposition over and over.A tip on these if you'r having trouble with too much flex, get a couple 1/2"" nylon shims, use these for spacing to get more leverage and it makes it much easier.All in all, a good buy if you're taking off alot of interior panels and want to keep them looking nice and unmarred."
5,A must tool for auto enthusiast,"The tool is made with a nice, sturdy plastic, yet soft enough not to dent any of the car trims when removing them. The set comes with the essential tools with different shapes that will get you in any corner. I will say that the tool is nice to get you started and to create small openings. However, I would not solely rely on the tool to yank or put any kind of force on the trim. These are made with plastic, after all.I've done a few radio, mp3, etc installations since I got the tool and I am really pleased with it. The trim pieces are not damaged at all and it saves time too. Well worth the money, if you are an auto enthusiast."
5,Genius!,Who would have ever thought to make a clip and trim panel remover like this? There isn't a panel in my car I've failed to remove with this set on my side. I'm afraid that the plastic trim panels in my car would break due to it being a 14 year old car. These are very sturdy and the leverage on this is perfect. It basically fits anywhere.
4,trim remover,I like the wide variety of pry bars that are in this kit. Thay are much better than the old school ones that are metal and scratch everything up. The price is decent too.
4,Great job,"I received my book in fine shape, you have saved me about $60.00 that I would have had to pay for my book at the college book store,(Used). You were prompt and your description was right on.Thank You And HAPPY NEW YEARS DAY!"
4,"Effective at controlling bounce, difficult to install.","These shocks do their intended job well once installed. The vehicle has improved handling and a nice smooth ride. Unfortunately, there is a metal tube in the middle of a rubber isolator at the top of the shock that was not fully inserted into this rubber piece. The bolt that mounts the top of the shock to the vehicle is supposed to run through this metal tube. Unfortunately I had to spend a great deal of time driving this tube properly through the rubber on both shocks. I ended up using the lower mounting bolt and hex nut and tightening them to force the tube through the rubber piece so that I could fit the upper shock mount into the vehicles brackets. After this the shock mounted easily. I found this defect in both shocks I received."
4,My favorite Steppenwolf EVER!,"The first time I heard this album was sometime around '73. It had only been out for three years. Someone GAVE it to me. I couldn't believe it. There were so many amazing songs I'd never heard before. So why only 4 stars? Well, there are a couple of clunkers. But hey, what awesome classic motorbike doesn't have em?! If you want 5 stars then go with ""Born to be Wild"". But this album will haunt you forever. ""Foggy Mental Breakdown"" (my favorite Steppenwolf song, bar none), Hoyt Axton's (!) ""Snowblind Friend"" (2nd favorite), ""Renegade"", John Kay's own story about when he and his mother were smuggled out of East Germany, and a couple of classic good ol biker songs, ""Ball Crusher"" and ""Hippo Stomp"". Every lover of late '60s-early '70s Rock deserves to hear this album before they die."
5,"dreamy, beautiful tunes... i recommend this!","do you miss the ""old"" r.e.m.? Do you like excellently tuned music with memorable lyrics? Then do not hesitate to buy this cd! From the catchy ""pawtucket"" and ""until I saw the fish"" to the dreamy ballads ""blue mtn."" and ""stairs"" to the country-esque landscape of ""no health"" and ""sustance""... this cd never fails to deliver. As a providence native, and a follower of this band, I can safely say that they are one of the true gems of our 'lil scene. A must hear for anyone who is fed up with the same-old-stuff-format forced fed tothe masses by contemporary radio markets. Just lie back and dream along with Chris and the rest of the P.I.Shadows."
3,The pen didn't work,The pen didn't work but the set was great .the whole set was small but still great for the money because only for each price is well over a 100 $$$ .
4,Comes in Spanish,"I ordered this Product and it's great as far as value. It looks great, just what I was expecting except the guest book came in spanish instead of english. I was never asked what language, neither did I have an option to choose. Thank God I have 6 weeks until the wedding and it only took 2 weeks to come in. I have Emailed the company and waiting for a response and I will update this comment.UPDATE: They answered my email the very next morning, and they are sending out one in English. I'm very satisfied now!! :-)"
5,Works with Alpine TUA-T020XM,I used this to connect the Terk Micro antenna to my Alpine TUA-T020XM which has double connectors. Great reception now. Tip: when you first assemble this you have to press hard on the plastic connectors to get them to snap onto the metal ends.
4,Works As Intended.,Unit works as expected to connect a new one wire antenna to an Alpine XM adapter that has 2 antenna inputs. It did not come with the yellow and green connectors attached but it doesn't matter if they are installed or which way they go since both outputs are the same so you can just snap them on either lead.
5,Terk Satellite Radio Single to Dual Antenna input splitter,This product worked exactly as described. Perfect for older xm systems to be copatible with the newer single line xm antennas.
4,Splits antenna feed to two receivers,"This product does work to split an XM signal to two receivers. In my case I have a receiver, and a Delphi wireless repeater to allow XM in a bad reception area of my house. I can listen to both at the same time no problem."
5,An excellent pair of shorts!,"Enough folks have said that the shorts are great; I agree, so I won't repeat their words.What impresses me the most is the way Drishti stands behind the product. I ordered 3 pairs of these after a careful search and comparison with similar products. When they arrived, I tried them on and discovered that two of them had incorrectly sized leg openings in the support brief. I then contacted Drishti directly, and they immediately sent me replacements and a postage-paid priority mail envelope to return the defective shorts. Very impressive!These are not the cheapest yoga shorts out there, but that kind of product support provides peace of mind and makes the extra cost easily worth it."
4,very great bikram yoga shorts,"I really like these shorts and would give them 5 five stars if it wasn't for the two small tags that bother my back side near the waist line. I can remove them, and once I start sweating in these shorts there is no problem, but I don't think I should have to be bothered by stiff tags in shorts that are meant to be worn alone. Other than that, these are a great pair of shorts for hot yoga, they work like they say they will."
3,"good, not great","Good, not great. The waist band to waist band seam in the back is also the junction of the waist band to shorts seam. Result is 4X material thickness at these seams in this one location which is right over my sacrum. Not comfortable, digs in when laying on my back, especially when pressuring my sacrum with leg lifts. The shorts fit great, but the inner mesh support is tight for me. Maybe I a have a big a**; but hopefully my excess size is in the front. Shorts material is great and super flexible. Needs a pocket."
3,shorts,these shorts fit ok. a little short length wise. washing instructions indicate that they are fragile. that is the issue that i have with these shorts. too delicate. don't really look like the advertised picture. waist size was accurate.
5,Great hot yoga shorts,"These shorts work perfectly for me for Bikram hot yoga practice. They absorb perspiration well, stretch with me through poses without binding and maintain coverage. The inner liner provides just enough support to keep things in place. Even when they are soaked I can wipe my sweaty hands off on the shorts to get a better grip. I am 5'-11"", 178 lbs, 32"" waist and the mediums fit well. I like that they have no pockets and are very simply constructed. No distractions."
2,Not what I expected,"From the reviews on these I was expecting this to have a thicker liner and a bit more loose fit. Sadly this is not the case. I now use these shorts os my lounging/camping shorts because 1) my junk still shows through, in fact it was comically embarrassing when my buddies wife pointed this out to me. 2) My body type gives me thick thighs and as such I can not wear these because they about a few inches of material from turning into biker shorts.Get something from prAna (the Flex shorts have a liner, or Mojo for more leg room) because their products are great and are about the same price.++Material feel nice--- 'No Mystery Here' shorts"
5,Best men's yoga shorts,These shorts are the best men's yoga short! The seller Drishti is a great store with excellent customer service!I would recommend these shorts to all men who practice Bikram Yoga!
3,Yoga shorts,"Good shorts but for anyone who needs to blow their nose occasionally, there are no pockets. My other yoga shorts all have pockets. I also teach yoiga and put my sheet sheet in my pocket...but these have none. Pockets also help when not doing yoga for my MP3 player.Other than no pockets, quality is good. CD"
5,Well-designed yoga shorts,They are great and I now wear them to every class. They even seem to help me get into and hold postures better than my old gym shorts. Well worth the modest investment for those who do yoga regularly.
5,Great shorts,"These shorts are great, not too tight not too loose. I do a hot power yoga and sweat a lot, and I don't even notice I'm wearing these shorts."
3,It's only a practice test,"This book is only an 80 question practice test with answers provided. It reflected the general nature of the Praxis II for physics. In general not great, but not bad. I found that the larger study guides (not the ETS ones) had tests that were equally as good and had study material as well."
3,Not Bad,"I have a great desire to explore new art song and this recording is a nice resource for that exploration. The John Musto selections, "" Litany"" and ""Island"" stand out from the others as exceptional and beautiful art song; however, after looking at the music myself, I found that Church could not rise to the challenge of some of the difficulty of the pieces. Her vibrato becomes uneven at the ends of some phrases as she struggles to make them, sometimes ending the phrase before marked because she has no more air to give. She has a beautiful forte sound but more work needs to be done to control her voice in the mezzo-piano range. This deficiency robed some of the pieces."
5,This CD is awesome!,"The first 2 soak cd's were good, even though alot of Flywatt was just remixed Soak songs. But this cd is very original, except for one song, but thats ok. Every song on this song rocks except one, but Burrito is so random and funny that it makes up for the, in my opinion, poorer musical quality. ""Get Out"" is one of the best songs from any band I have heard in a long time. Buy this cd if u like Soak. If you don't, I will hire Steve Forbes to come to your house in the night and sing u songs from Re-Load."
4,Great peeler but you can save some money with fixed head.,"Great peeler that does everything it should. However, I have found no need for the pivoting head. You can save money buy buying the one with the fixed head. Not the extra large model but one the same size as this one."
2,Not what I thought,"This is the second ceramic peeler I have bought and it is not nearly as strong as I was lead to believe. When trying to peel ""butternut squash"" the blade frequently pops off the handle. This is an injury waiting to happen. The peeler works fine for potatoes, cucumbers and carrots but does not have the strengh to cut heavy skinned vegies."
4,red peeler,Hi this is good but the one before I did like better this does not seem as sharp but will do Rose
1,Swivel pins keep breaking,It's big and red and easy to spot in your kitchen utilities drawer but don't let the husband peel the potatoes. The blade may last 10 times longer than steel but the pins holding the blade in place have broken twice now.I contacted the company and they are sending me a new peeler for free but I don't think that will solve the fragile pin problem. Can the ceramic be used to make the pins?
1,does not work well,"The blade is not securely attached to the handle. On irregular surfaces the blade pops off. It's fine on something smooth, if you don't use much force. Not so good for potatoes."
2,Great but fragile,"My stepmother bought this for me and I found it to be very sharp and great for peeling vegetables. However, it broke the 4th time I used it. Also as another reviewer pointed out, it does not have a potato eye remover.Overall not worth the money!"
2,Kyocera CP-20 Imperfect Peeler,When I recieved the peeler the blade was missing so I must switch the blade with my Y peeler. This got to be a hassle so I only use the Y peeler now.
1,Great Peeler while it lasted!,"Great peeler while it lasted, The blade holder just broke. It lasted less than 3 months. Kind of expensive for it to only last such a short time."
3,Does Not Last,"I did actually like this peeler very much, it worked fine, but then, after a little over two years of use, as other reviewers have noted, the plastic pin holding the blade in place snapped off, and it was useless at that point. For this much money, Kyocera should have made the fitting sturdier."
2,"Great Blade, Poor Construction","We have had 4 of these, and the blade is great. The problem is that the stubs that connect it to the handle are not well engineered. They break off fairly easily. If Kyocera improved this, I would buy it again."
5,This young author has talent!,My children have really enjoyed reading Ander's two books. They are influenced by his ability to write so well and describe in detail the adventures in both of his books. Thank you Anders and continue to write.
5,The Norton Reader,"Excellent condition, fast delivery, couldn't have asked for more and all for a great price!"
1,Mak12,I was super hyped about this company when I found them due to it's commitment to wholefood and organic products. I really enjoyed this product also. Unfortunately this company sold out to global corporate giant Procter and Gamble. Procter and Gamble's main shareholders are also Monsanto's .... a company who has done damage around the world and especially in this country to food supplies through greed based genetic engineering of food. I believe that twisted practice will carry over to New Chapter products resulting in an inferior product.This buyout by P&G; can't be a good thing. I dropped my subscribe and save for this product and another New Chapter product. I'll never buy their products again.
1,Product description lacking detail,Maybe it's good but is it standardized? To what %? How many milligrams? Am I missing something? Where's the detail? It's grown in Costa Rica but is it bigger than a breadbox?
2,Not So Special,"I have been taking Curcumin supplements and can tell you they help with arthritis pain, however, this product did not help much and I will not buy again."
4,necessary for heart health,"I haven't opened the package yet, but I am sure it will be fine. Turmeric is essential for heart health and as a preventative against cancer. I take one every other day alternating with flax seed oil capsules. Both of these can thin the blood if you take too much, which is why I alternate. I heard about Turmeric on Coast to Coast AM - host, George Noory"
3,Too soon to tell,Following the instructions I've not had any of the possible negative digestive side effects. Too early to tell whether the anti-inflamatory benefits are real.
5,great for arthritis,"New Chapter - Turmericforce, 60 softgels I have been using this product for three years and find that it really helps eliminate my arthritis pain. Since I have been using it, I have had little to no stiffness in my hips and fingers, and rarely have pain in my knees. Please note that you have to take this herb for about three months before you start to see significant results. I have tried other brands of turmeric, and this one seems to be the most effective."
1,Company Sold out to Major Conglomerate,"And what a shame. New Chapter was one of my favorite brands for all natural supplements and I take ALOT of them as a former cancer patient. Tumeric/curcimin one of the best preventatives for cancer (NOTE: I am not a doctor, please do your own research as I did).Already have another brand that I use but still saddened to see that this all natural company sold out like this. Google around for info on conglomerate that bought them. Had reviewed this once before with the name and Amazon removed the review."
5,anti-inflammatory,"this herb is an amazing potent anti-inflammatory, that can be beneficial to those with arthritis or any kind of generalized inflammatory response. obviously, check with your PCP before taking."
2,Edge's are too sharp,"I bought this as a breathable alternative to another rib wrap I own (how many rib-wraps does one person need?!)But it is only slightly more flexible than your standard paper-cardboard box (think of cutting open and wrapping your mid-section with a cereal box) So if you are doing anything remotely active the edges dig into your skin, not really comfortable.If you do as the picture shows and wear it outside your shirt I suppose it works ok, but that's kind of like Superman wearing his red underwear on the outside of his blue spandex...certainly would be a fashion statement."
3,Decent,"It does it's job, but the Velcro wore out after first couple weeks if that. Now I have to wrap it with a bandage or it won't stay."
5,Informational,This show is great. A forward and to the heart of the matter. The process of interviewing up to intervention helps with keeping the watcher engaged.
4,intervention,Decent show and amazon instant video makes it easy to download and keep available. Makes you more thankful for family and what you have.
4,Good and clear message,A must read for anyone involved in product development.A clear proponent of modern solutions like Arena Solutions OnDemand Product Lifecycle Management.
4,Smart and Sexy!,"An unbelievable, surreal world created by this author proves to me that some authors are truly a cut above! For those who love women in latex and unusual ways to dress in latex - this novel is for you. Very erotic and yet a smart story with intelligent characters! This author truly takes you to a different level (pun intended!) when it comes to erotiscm."
5,Ginger Force works,"I have had stomach problems for several years. I used to drink Ginger Ale to quell stomach upset or drink ginger tea. I read the product information about New Chapter Gingerforce and gave it a try. I finished my first bottle and wasn't quick to buy another bottle and my stomach reminded me of why I was taking it in the first place. Now I am on ""subscribe and save"" so I always have the product on hand and take it daily. I highly recommend the product and New Chapter."
1,Ripoff!,"I suffer from GERD and peptic ulcer disease, and ginger really has changed my life. I experience great relief from ginger teas, authentic gingerale, ginger candies, and even just chewing on it fresh; so, I thought GingerForce might work even better. Oh man, was I wrong! This stuff is supposed to be concentrated, but it did not help at all to soothe my stomach or fight nausea. GingerForce provided me no effect whatsoever, unless you count being $18 poorer. Don't waste your money on this when you could get stuff that is effective from your local grocer for a fraction of the cost!"
3,"Fine, a little overpriced","The sticks are ok, but you can probably get 'em cheaper elsewhere. Or at least I did."
5,Flawless,"This is yet another brilliant effort by Italy's finest progressive rock outfit. The musicianship is, as always, exceptional. This is not a band that sat still. Each album contains efforts to assume new directions and this is no exception. Where the choral intro may prove taxing for some it actually works quite well within the context of the overall recording. There is not a weak cut in the collection. Influences are broad (chamber music, Italian classical, Beatles, jazz) yet combine to create a truly unique and original sound. Wonderful album, wonderful band. Highly recommended...Simon"
4,"magnificent, but",this is a magnificent album specialy trac no. 1 if you love italian prog. and dont have it buy it it's a must. now if you want pfm best album consider chocolat king it is much more aggresive.
5,Best Book to Beat Cravings,"This is my first review because I've always felt the other reviewers captured the essence of the books I've purchased from Amazon.com. But...this book has changed my life. I've purchased dozens of books on addiction and craving. I've read about the biology and the why and when of it all. Most of the books I've read, however, don't address specific strategies for what to do when a craving hits. This book does and its suggestions have been working for me.This book addresses the issue that 12-step programs don't work for everyone and that there are other solutions. The tools outlined in this book work.If you've ever wanted to stop letting an addiction rule your life or wanted to get rid of a bad habit, this is the book for you."
5,Fast Shipping!!!,"Very fast shipper!!! Came looking brand new, would order from this seller anytime!! Said the product was used, looked brand new, was worried because it was a workbook it would already have been worked through, not the case!!! Excellent!"
4,where's the goo,"The wires are working just fine, however the clips on the wires that attach them to the distributer cap would not clip so I replaced the clips off the old wires on to these.wires work fine now also you will need to buy extra goo I unfortunately don't know the name but it orevents the boot from sticking on the plug they don't give you nearly enough. But the product does work."
1,"poor quality, not true to color or pattern",Material is very flimsy and has a boxy pattern on it not seen in pictures. Color is more mint green than sage green. Material easily pulls and falls apart. Buyer beware!
2,Comes Apart,"If this is like the other Blok Bots then: This is not a Toy to be played with. Hard to stay together. The box photos are deceptive. If you handle the toy in any way it comes apart. Not as good as Legos and cheap. Very complicated, and 185 cheap parts, we have and enjoy lots of building toys, but this is unnecessarily more complicated than the box shows, and won't stay together. Come on CEO, you can do better than this. The box photos are a laugh, the Blok Bot Cannot do what the photos say it can do with out a LOT of carefull work. And as soon as you touch it. IT COMES APART! My son is very dissapointed, he loves it but can't touch it. I'm gluing it together. So much for it's ""transforming"" ability."
5,Great Vitamin at 33% less on Amazon than health food stores,"I love this vitamin! My husband gets the Every Man's Daily and I get the Every Woman's Daily. You can even take these on an empty stomach since they are easier to digest and absorb. They also have probiotics in them, which helps with the digestive tract. We both are speech therapists and work with young kids who are always sick with something it seems. We have noticed that although we still do get sick 3-5 times a year, our symptoms are always much more mild since we have been taking these vitamins. We had been buying these vitamins at New Frontier's and I just discovered these exact vitamins on Amazon for 33% less, which is great since these aren't cheap!"
5,Great Vitamins,"I love these vitamins. I felt great after taking them and unlike other vitamins, they didn't make me sick. You don't have to take them with food either which I found very helpful."
5,Wow,"I could not believe the difference I felt when I started taking these. Other vitamins are fairly cheap, but not nearly as effective. I felt more alert within one day of starting these."
1,unknown???,Ordered on Dce. 14-2012. as of today 12-29-2012I haven't received it yet.... Hmmmm. I'm not quite sure @ this time when? it will arrive or if it's ever???
5,Good quality,This patch was the perfect size and the colors are bright. Great quality and fast shipment. I attached this to a black sweatshirt and it looks great.
5,Beautiful book with wonderful recipes,"The Hali'maile General Store Cookbook is one of my very favorite cookbooks. Bev Gannon and her restaurants are very well known on the island of Maui, Hawaii. She takes a little bit of southwestern and a little bit of Pacific Rim ingredients to create the most delicious dishes.The recipes are fairly easy to prepare, most ingredients can be found on the mainland, she explains every step clearly, and the photographs of the food are beautiful. You can see how she prepares some of the dishes on her website."
4,Beautiful as it is good!,"The Portuguese Bean Soup recipe is really the best I've ever had.The book is broken down by seasons which I found to be more authenic as well as easy to use. Most people don't realize that Hawai'i does indeed have seasons-other than the tourist season.My step-father, a native of Hawai'i, and I have had much fun shopping for some of the ingredients here on the ""mainland"". We have been able to find just about everything to make several of the recipes (and neither of us live in a large town).For some great Portuguese Bean Soup, you have to get this book!"
4,Great Memories in this cookbook.....,"If you've ever been to the Hali'Imaile General store, you know this is going to be good. It's a great souvenir of your trip, even if you can't cook. The photos of the restaurant are wonderful as are the little opening stories Bev writes before each chapter begins. You do need to know a bit about cooking for some of the recipes."
2,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed the Shrimp 8utler was not effect for my purpose. I bought the item to peel hundreds of shrimps I need for different events & found that it is quicker to peel the shrimps by hand.What is even more disappointing is that when I found out there is a re-stocking charge & have to pay shipping again to return the Shrimp Butler, I might as well keep the product & hope to find someone I know that I can give the Shrimp Butler to."
2,Not worth the money,The shrimp Butler looked easy to use. It did not take off the tales and devein very easily. The shrimp repeatedly got stuck inside.
1,A piece of junk,"Based on the video, I bought this item. Ahhh...just cannot trust what my eyes saw.Pros:1. Cheap and mechanical. That's it, folks.Cons:1. A S^%%$$$**** to clean.2. Does not work. It mangled up the shrimp and just chopped up the shrimp veins and poops.Summary:Save your hard earned money for something else. It made look like a fool in front of my wife for buying junks on the Net."
4,Great Shower Radio!,"Originally, I had planned on buying a Sony shower radio w/ a CD player for around $100. They were out of stock and w/ the MP3 market these days, I decided on this radio. It does hold about 8 full length songs on it. Uploading songs to the device from your computer is really easy: it just takes a few mouse clicks and about 30 seconds. The radio itself is loud and has good sound quality. AIWA just unveiled their 128MB & 256MB Removable Storage Media devices a few weeks ago so those should be available very soon for those who aren't satisfied with the 32MB. I would highly recommend this to anyone. You can take it anywhere with you."
4,Nice gadget for wet environments,"The quality of the radio reception is very high, in the closed places there is no interferance on the radio, its quite good.The backlight of lcd screen is blue and difficult to read while moisture on the screen!.The player's memory is just 32 Mbytes and it is sufficient for bath time(approx.half an hour) cd quality music, you can save only 5 or 6 tracks to listen.You can buy 128/256 MB version PAVIT from the manufacturer if you want to spend more money to listen long time music.Overall,radio is good, mp3 player's memory is not enough. If you are using shower it's ok.Battery life is normal (15 days), because that.. while in the shower, you need to pump up the volume."
5,"Melvin Sparks, the man can ""groove""","I am surprised that Melvin never gained more fame... the man can groove... anything by him is incredible, buy it... one of my favorite guitar players, right up there with Grant Green..."
2,Teaser for the whole course,"This book is a brief introduction to cycles and how they are used in trading. But it does not have info on how cycle lengths are determined; it appears the author uses a computer program. It might stimulate more interest in cycles, but by itself, won't help your trading, in my opinion."
4,A good way to sample this lady from New Orleans!,"This CD falls half way between a full length CD and a ""CD Single"". It runs just 18 minutes and nearly 5 minutes is devoted to the highly - ""Borderline"", which fits this New Orleans native's smokey voice. She plays violin on a few tracks and guitar on others. Track 2 - ""Accoustomed to the Dark"" has a false guitar start which was strangely left in. Her sound probably has more of an Austin touch to it than New Orleans and the lead off track is a Lucinda Williams tune ""Jackson"" (No, not the Johnny Cash/June Carter song by the same name.)If you liked her first full length CD, you'll enjoy this as well.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic"""
5,The American Legion: An Official History 1919-189,"As a new Commander of an American Legion Post, I purchased this book to learn the background of the organization. If you are an officer in the American Legion you need this book. It starts out in 1919 describing the thoughts and ideals that the originators had, on up to 1989. It shows the many things the Legion has done for military veterans. They were key in establishing the American Heart Association and the Veterans Bureau. You see that not much has changed since 1919 as far as the ideals and beliefs that are still held in todays posts. Great book."
2,Delivers The Goods,"It was only after I purchased this that I realized a copyright claim was never made on this film and it has always been in the public domain, meaning there are innumerable ""bootlegs"" floating around of inferior quality of which this is one, whereas in 2000 Milestone Film & Video released a restored version based on the original negative. While this DVD delivers the goods, the quality is pretty bad, there's not even a proper menu to the film, the sound and picture quality are very average and there are no extra features whatsoever. Considering this is just an inferior dub for which the DVD maker would have had to pay $0 in licensing fees, the list price of $15.99 is hefty indeed. I'd seek out the restored original and stay away from bootlegged copies like this"
3,"Overwhelmingly Confusing, but Magnificently Composed","I found a lot to adore in The Trial, but just as much to furrow my brow over. The cinematography is stunning; full of visual metaphor and gorgeous photography, it's an unyielding show of moviemaking expertise. Welles plays up the bleak, ""no tomorrow"" nature of the exterior scenes, the structured chaos of the workplace and the hedonistic excess exhibited by the various stages of the trial itself, each to great effect. The story, though, feels too flighty and nebulous for my taste. It should come as no surprise, being a translation of a Kafka novel, that the entire picture often feels surreal and confusing. It continuously floats and sputters just beyond the grasp of understanding, like a moth delicately avoiding a set of flailing hands. The premise may have been established nicely during the slightly more straightforward opening scenes, but as the duration grows it becomes too ambitiously ambiguous for its own good."
2,Just look at the cover,"Yeah, I think any dvd that features pictures of the actors on the cover that do not match their portrayals in the movie itself should be a red flag that signifies ""stay away""! I mean the picture of Welles on the cover is from the late 1970's at the very earliest."

5,"iMac 17"" - Best computer I've ever owned","Apple stuff just works. Got Microsoft Office vX and all my Office documents work perfectly on the iMac. If all you want to do is surf the web and do e-mail, a Mac is just as good as a PC, though sometimes there are some things that won't work as well on a Mac (for example streaming video with Windows Media Player, which IS available on Macs, though apparently not as robustly). But for audio, video, and pictures, there is no comparison - Macs are better."
5,Fantastic computer!,"This computer is all around a fantastic buy, IMHO. The 1GHz G4 CPU is nice and zippy and the beautiful 17"" display is simply AWESOME. Includes the latest iApps to play with which is such a nice suite of apps for those wanting to really venture into digital media easily.The unit is almost silently, except when a CD/DVD spins up. I have no complaints."
4,fast baby,"this is fast its 128 bit G4 processor 3 times faster then a 32bit Pentium 4 processors.Thats the same power as a 3.0GHz Pentium 4 processor,buy this baby! you wont regrent it."
5,Amazing Electric menorah is the only one in the world with seperate switches for each light!,"Such a beautiful and tasteful menorah. The fact that each light has it's own switch is just ""the icing on the cake!""!"
5,A rare behind-the-scenes look at a special kind of nun and her work,"as this documentary follow Sister Noella while she studies and learns more about the work she does as a Benedictine nun in Connecticut. It is a very interesting look at one nun, the Benedictine abbey where she lives, and - cheese. The program has almost more information than I wanted to know about cheese, and I'll probably never look at cheese in quite the same way as I used to."
1,Poor quality. Unusable tools.,"I received this item with 14 unusable bits. They were warped or improperly forged; most of the ""tamper proof"" bits had misaligned centers. One bit, the torx ""tamper proof"" T-25, had metal slag residue covering the tip; it was completely unusable.I promptly returned it for a refund and ordered the ""Klein 32510 Magnetic Screwdriver with 32-Piece Tamperproof Bit Set"" instead. Although it doesn't contain the quantity of bits as this ""SE"" set, it is of higher quality and includes a driver.In conclusion, the overall quality in this set is dreadful. Had I been shipped a properly machined set, I still wouldn't have expected these tools to last more than a few uses due to the ""softness"" of the material. Absolutely awful tools. Buyer beware."
4,Nice all-in-one bits,"This bits package is pretty much everything I'm ever gonna need. The box is a little soft and doesn't hold the bits very tightly (it arrived in a mess with a lot of bits in loose), but not too bad. What really matters is the quality of the bits, and although I can't tell much about durability yet from my a few days of using, the overall quality looks pretty good so far."
2,Not that great,"A poorly constructed set of bits. It would be suitable for someone who doesn't actually use tools. Many bits, especially smaller torx bits are nearly smooth on the surface. Those with a center hole drilled in are universally off center. They seem to work so far but just barely. At least they were cheap."
2,poor quality chineese tools,"well,,,, i should have known better ! a couple of the bits don't fit in the holders, bits don't stay put in the case. when you open it some always fall out. i havent tried to use them yet, but i doubt they will work well either.but i guess i got what i paid for."
3,Has everything but not the size i need,im a xbox 360 modder and i like to open cases and add cool designs to them. This is a great box but however it doesnt have a t6 wich is the main I need *sadface. There is however lots of pieces you can use and extra spots to add your bits.
1,Not good,I think I saw one hot chick in this entire dvd at the very beginning. Most were just awful looking and over 40 years old. If you are looking to see lots of athletic college babes on a nude beach you will be very dissapointed here. Many of the other girls going crazy videos have lots of hot girls topless- but the nude beach series is not one of them.
4,Great Backround Music,This album is great for soft backround music at a dinner party or a romantic dinner at home.
3,change your ad,"Your ad says that the bottle contains 60 Vcaps. I was recently dissapointed to find that New Chapter has discontinued it's use of Vcaps in order to keep it's organic certification. I went on Amazon to see if anyone had any of the older Vcaps in stock still and was happy to find your ad. However when I received my product I was dissapointed again to find that you were just unaware of the change and are selling the gelatin capsules now. I love this product, but as a vegetarian, i am unable to support the use of gelatin in medicine. Please chance to your ad to represent the product truthfully. Thanks,Almost Happy"
4,Light & refreshing,It has the health benefits from the ginger with a refreshing hint of lemon. Lovely! My favourite tea for sure!
2,Un-natural flavoring,"I bought this tea to help soothe a stomach bug, but couldn't even finish a single cup. I'm a huge fan of other brands of lemon ginger tea, but this one tastes like furniture polish -- lots of chemical overtones.The ingredients list includes ""natural flavors"" as the second ingredient, which explains a lot... [...]Too bad, since I've been drinking Twinings teas for decades. I'll donate this to the breakroom at work, since judging from other reviews here, I'm just more sensitive to this than other drinkers!"
4,lemon and ginger,"Good lemon & ginger tea. I like mine slightly sweet - helps to meld the lemon and ginger flavors. Has a strong peppery bite. My favorite so far is Tea Forte - I really like that one, but it is out of my acceptable price range. Twinings is a good substitute."
3,OK but not outstanding,Twinings - Lemon & Ginger Herb Tea - 6 Units / 20 bagThe flavor of this tea is OK but not outstanding.
5,Twinings Tea,Great flavor. My friend from England introduced me to Twinings products and they are by far a superior product.
2,Not a best herbal tea...,"Tea has quite strong lemon essence smell out of the box. That makes me wonder how much ""natural"" vs. artificial flavoring is there. Ginger is way too strong. Some people might like it..."
1,"The book is in Greek while classified under ""Language: English""",Only the introduction is in English.
5,Great job,Can quick and more liquid than described... 2 up thumbs. I was more than happy slash impressed with the promptness of this company
5,Great Product,Great product! GH was prompt in the delivery of my purchase and sent me a catalog of the other products they sell as well! I will be using GH again.
4,Review,"The same thing I wrote for Soy Lecithin Non-GMO in my earlier review. It's a quality product, but don't take it if you plan on doing so for Lyme disease while you're on (most) antibiotics. But I'm not a doctor. This is just my input and I wouldn't take it as gospel. Just be careful if you're considering it (it's probably safe, but the more such supplements you add, the higher risk you have of blocking something like an enzyme out, which may interact strongly with the antibiotic(s) you're taking and thereby reduce the effect)."
4,Lessons of Life,"This book is appealing to young women and mature readers alike. It is a tale of romance with the added dimension of family relations and cross cultural ideas. The text gives the reader a glimpse into the Taiwanese society as well as the feelings, desires and emotions of the two sisters. The book is thoughful and well written."
5,Dark Magick,"It kept me readin and i never wanted to put it down. A definate thiller. I read it in less than one day, starting on the bus to school and ending in Spanish with my teacher saying, ""Put the book away."" When I did I took it back out 5 seconds later. She didn't notice"
5,Hard to put down; the best yet in the series,"There's a reason this book has a five star average: It's well written, suspenseful, and part of a great series. The best in the series thus far. My only complaint is that the books are too short! They end so abruptly it's like they cut one book up into many long chapters and made each chapter its own book. Definitely worth reading though."
5,Keeps you on the edge of your seat!,"I do have to give the reader a potential warning: if you thought that you were addicted to the series before, you most certainly will be after reading this book!!The story once again picks up on the very tail end of the previous book. In order to save her boyfriend, Morgan had to attack someone. Understandably traumatized, Morgan starts to distance herself from her boyfriend Cal after the event. When she begins to grow suspect of Selene & Cal's intentions, Morgan finds that almost everything she thought she knew is far from he truth.This book was a little sad to read & since I don't want to give the plot away, I can't really post as to why. (If you've read the book you'll understand.) Still, we are left off with several interesting new plot developments for us to focus on & keep us incredibly riveted!"
5,releif,Morgan is lost. Did she really kill hunter? No. She meets him alive.Her life ic again changing. a seed of dought about Cal is growing. Was Hunter telling the truth or lying? Morgan doesn't Know. Then Morgan learns a disturbing truth about Cal. Is Cal who she thought she was. Was Hunter telling the truth? Read this book and find out!
3,Nice downtempo debut,"The Chilling Effect is a nice debut for Pelican City. It is very polished production-wise and is easy on the ears for the most part. I would compare the atmospheric hip-hop inspired tracks to more recent cds by DJ Krush or Dj Shadow - at least in style. Certainly it would be very difficult to make a musical statement on par with DJ Shadow, but The Chilling Effect soundtrack captures the lazy, gloomy emotions that makes downtempo hip-hop attractive. I really like Pelican City's use of acoustic guitar and jazz trumpet on a couple of tracks. They lend an earthy quality to the electronic beats and samples. I must say that one or two of the tracks seem to drag on a bit, but overall I was impressed by this first effort. It makes me want to hear wether Pelican City improves on the formula on the second cd."
4,Bright star in the bleak sky,"Coming out of the heart of the South, Pelican City comes fresh with a melodic, spacious album that builds and grows finally taking root in your soul. The gradual progression of loops and chords is perfect to sit back on the porch to and have a nice, tall, cool glass of pink lemonade. It 's the type of album that over time fills in the blanks with every listening; the samples add a finishing touch such to that of icing on a cake. If time is not an object and quality a must, this is the sureshot!"
3,look better online and far away,"These chairs are ok. I like the look, from a far.Up close, you see a lot of rough welds, also the cheap plastic brown caps on the top ends of the metal. and the bolts, nuts, etc that hold it together.For comfortable. they are decent. they are firm, not at all cushy. but not too bad.one thing to consider, the metal arms can be cold on your arms during cool weather/nights."
1,very fun,i havent't yet received my items payed more than 1 month agocompliments for the servicewhat can i say about ?1 star it's too much
5,Best seasoning,"I just had the most delicious barbecued country style pork ribs. I asked what was done to make them so good and the cook said that he just rubbed the seasoning on them, then cooked them on the BBQ. They were so good! I must have this seasoning to try in the other ways I've read about in the reviews."
5,Simply the best,I've tried a lot of other seasonings and rubs but this one is at the top of my list. We eat a lot of chicken and the whole family agrees on this one. I was disappointed the grocery stores stopped carrying it but was delighted to find it online.
1,Almost all Salt--Terrible!,The ingredients are different from the label. I ruined a chicken with this seasonong which is so salty as to be indigestible. Salt is listed as the first ingredient but in the description Garlic is listed first. Terrible seasoning.
4,A Twisted Tale of a Musician's Rise and Fall,"Nudie, the costume designer for a mysterious carnival, takes a shine to up-and-coming countrysinger Hank. Hank's just been asked to appear at the Grand Ole Opry, and Nudie convinces Hank to allow him to design his clothes. Soon, it becomes clear that Nudie's intentions are more wicked and devious than what Hank is prepared for. With minimal and precise words, author Derek McCormack creates a creepy underworld of country music and vamprisim. He uses only what is necessary and allows the reader's mind to fill in the scenes, offering a very effective story that sent chills down my spine during the last chapter. A fine, quick read."
1,"Sounds like it would be funny, but it's not.","A factious Hank Williams, a factious Grand Ol' Opry, a factious Nudie (the Western Wear guy) who happens to be a gay vampire who runs a sideshow on the side complete with wax museum and abnormal babies in jars...thing is as funny or interesting or entertaining as it might sound, it's not. I don't remember laughing once and the only reason I finished the book was because it's so short. The horror factor wasn't there either perhaps due to the minimalist wording. It just falls short of depth."
1,Very disappointing,"This calendar is not as good as the one published with the permission of the Keith Haring Estate. Many of the images are not even complete pictures, just portions of the entire work."
5,Millennium,"The songs on this CD are very moving and captivating, The bluesy - soulful stylings of ""Fall in Love"" and ""Know by Now"" are both sad and seductive. The lryics to Millinium seem to sum up the mood of the country. All and all this is a wonderful CD!! Everytime I listen to it I find something else to love!!"
5,meaningful,I loved every single song on this cd. All lyrics to all songs have deep meaning and I'm a lyrics persons not to mention the melodies in each song are all unique in the their own way. Bill plays all instruments and his strong vocals display a whole lot of talent. I enjoy the cd very much!!
5,Fall in Love,Who is Bill Zucker? The man that makes my heart race with feelings I thought no longer existed. The words and music of every song are hauntingly beautiful. His songs are true to life. I keep this cd in my car and it's all I listen to. I would like to have more from Mr. Zucker. This cd is truly a treasure and the radio stations should start playing more music like this. They should play this! More people would fall in love and the world would be a better place because of Bill Zucker. Thank you sir.
2,Use too much to make deep colors,"It takes a lot of drops to make deep colors, I ended up using an entire jar on 1 batch of candy. Was very disappointed, I'll purchase larger bottles from Candy Suppliers in the future."
5,Great colors,Love this product I was having so much trouble with my chocolate freezing up when I would try to color it for decoration. This product works great the colors are really clear and not muddled.
5,Candy Colors,"I Love The Colors...to bad the jars are so small. I make a lot of candy melts, and hope the jars get bigger, that way I don't have to keep buying these little guys. It's hard to find, OIL based candy colors for chocolate in a bigger bottle, that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, for shipping! I think $22 dollars for shipping, is ridiculous, for ONE bottle!!!"
4,see your keyboard,"I am not a touch typist, and have trouble finding myway on black keyboards in low light. A white keyboardsolves much on the problem. These wireless keyboardsand mice are convenient, although, on my metal desk atwork, they have very limited range."
1,Mom of a disappointed 6 year old who is an avid Avatar fan,"Bought this game over the weekend for my son's 6 birthday. He played the game for all of 15 minutes and said it was boring and asked me to take it back to the store. I then began to fiddle around with the game and came to the same conclusion after about 5 minutes. It's slow, the dialogue is useless......blah!blah! not worth talking about anymore.'"
3,"Love Avatar, but.....","This is a good game. Graphics are a bit fuzzy, but decent enough. The game just isn't long enough. I didn't play it constantly, maybe a few hours a day and I had it completed in a few days. I hope the next one if there is a next one is longer. It sucks that you can't retrace your steps, everything has to be done at one time."
5,Best Bible book I've found,I like this book allot because it gives answers on topics by using the Bible. I've bought several other bible help books and found that they often miss or don't discuss certain topics. A big topic often not covered in bible study books is about the Sabbath...Is it Sunday the first day of week or Saturday the Seventh day of week. Well this book covers it and even explains who changed the Sabbath day. Ive ordered multiple shipments of this book to give to relatives and friends.
5,Finally a nationally distributed album!,"Coming from Houston, the home town of the Swisha House, I have to say I am happy to see some very talented young men come up. If you like screwed up music, you will love this. My favorite song is Ghetto in the sky, it's dedicated to one of my high-school classmates. Touching without being mushy. The rest of the album bumps hard, so lean back and enjoy the ride!"
5,South Side,"This is my favorite album outta TX. My favorite hip hop comes outta TX. Most of these songs go hard. my favorite southern song right now is Big Ballin Shot Callin. Its defenately worth picking up. In my opinion Swishahouse is the tightest crew commin out of TX. If u like this album, u defenately need to pick up the Chopped and Screwed Version."
3,THE UGLY SIDE OF WAR,"NAMBUL 2 continues to amaze in Book 2, as the determination of the main characters to maintain their ethnic pride and their nationalism is dealt one devastating blow after another.Reading NAMBUL 2 isn't easy in the fact that you can see how these events could very easily happen at any time in the near future. Heck, most of these events have ALREADY happened in the 20th Century in one way, shape, or form.Like other Hyun se Lee manhwa titles, the illustrations tell the story more than the dialogue. While the first book depict the government's perspective on war, this second book reveals the inherent racism war tends to bring out in people. As the characters all experience a bit of the war taking place, the reader becomes touched and relates in at least one way."
1,Cannot believe this is the same product (S041062),"Epson has kept the same product numbers, yet changed the product completely. I have a pack of Epson paper, product number S041062 that I absolutely love. I bought it a long time ago. So, thinking Epson only changed their packaging, I ordered the same product number. It's NOT even close! I don't understand how they get away with it. The images I'm printing are completely washed out. I'm going to try ordering the number 5 and see if it's closer to what I was expecting this 3 to be. Ugh."
2,Cheap Paper,"It wasn't expensive to begin with I admit, though most of the epson papers have a pretty decent thickness and print quality, this paper is standard printer paper for the most part though more expensive than a pack of regular printer paper. For those looking for some of Epson's Photo paper quality or the ultra premium papers this just doesn't match up."
2,No better than copier paper,"I have to say I'm surprised by all the positive reviews for this product as I was completely disappointed with the quality. I purchased this 8.5"" x 11"" together with a package of 13"" x 19"". Both labeled matte presentation paper, both '3 stars' on the packaging. You would think it would be the same paper cut to different sizes, no? Not. The 8.5"" x 11"" is not coated, has a much rougher surface and soaks up the ink like a sponge resulting in dull looking images and wavy, saturated paper. In fact the same pages I had printed on 20 lb Staples copy paper with a color laser printer looked much better. The 13"" x 19"" paper was much better except for the fact that the uncoated side had a pale yellowish tint to it."
5,Great summary to start understanding risk,"This book is written in an easy to understand way, but contains highly accurate information.I find this book great to give students and non-experts to start understanding the concepts and theories regarding risk, environmental policy and pollution.It covers the following fields:- measuring risk- regulatory decision making- assessment methods- public participation.Altough it dates back 1998, the contents are still valid and up to date.The book was issued with the strong support of the American Chemical Society."
5,Great book,I had the chance to take a look at it after buying. It's a good book for the kids and adults will enjoy it as well.
5,Dr Seuss Treasury,"I purchased four copies of this treasury to use with students who are learning English. I love all the extra background information included with each story. It is also a real bargain since if you purchased the stories individually it would cost four times the price or more. All of my favorite stories were included in the treasury. I would recommend this to primary teachers or teachers of English, to librarians to purchase for school or public libraries or to parents to buy for their beginning readers."
4,Lovely Birthday Gift,"This book is just gorgeous, full of the favourte stories and all the familiar Dr Seuss drawings.A book for a young reader to treasure."
1,"too bulky, too compressed","Too bulky to be comfortably read in bed. Also, the pages seem to be ""doubled-up."" That is, it seems they squeeze 2 pages of the normal edition onto 1 page, which does not flow as well or look as attractive. Of course, Seuss rules otherwise, but get the single edition books."
4,Ok for review..,"It is great to have all these stories in one place. I almost forgot how fun they were to read, but it was something I wanted to have for Grandmothering...The spine, which has been mentioned before is not the best for viewing the pictures, or comfortably holding it open while reading with a small one on your lap but it is manageable.Dr. Seuss is timeless..and a must have in some form."
3,Changes in page layouts are disappointing.,"Since this is a dozen stories, it's expected this is going to be a big book. The facts and info on each story are quite interesting and really the major selling point for this book.The major disappointment was the change in page layout. If you compare it to the single books, the pages are just laid out differently. In a couple stories, there's a focal point in the story that is buried in the crease because the of the page changes. If they hadn't dont that, this would be an awesome book. The facts and info they include with the book make it worth keeping on my bookshelf, but I read from different compilations.Six by Seuss and A Hatful of Suess are two collections of multiple stories in a single book that preserve the original page layout. Both are available here on Amazon.Six by Seuss: A Treasury of Dr. Seuss ClassicsA Hatful of Seuss: Five Favorite Dr. Seuss Stories"
4,recommended,Classical Seuss - which means a lot of fun for children as well as adults. The book itself is big enought for my 7 & 1/2 month old son to confortably sit on it. The only minus - too many black & white illustrations.
5,Oh this made me smile!,"I bought this book to read to my brand new grandson. It contains all the favourite stories I loved when I was a kid oh so many years ago. I would read it in a box, I would read it with a fox, I would even read it while eating green eggs and ham. I love this book!"
3,Good price but hard to hold,"I like having a nice Dr Seuss collection, but this book is very heavy. It limits the way and places you can read it to kids. The price compared to other collections and individual books is very good though."
3,Great stories...but big book,"This is a great compilation of De. Seuss stories but the book is very large and heavy...not easy to hold and read... especially at bedtime, when trying to snuggle and read at the same time."
4,Great book for Dr. Seuss fans!,This book contains some of the best Seuss stories. It also gives you a background on each of the stories.This is a great read for adult and children Seuss fans. Great book with great stories.
3,"Great content, but the book is too heavy!","This is a fabulous collection of Dr. Seuss books, however the book is so large and unwieldy that I dread reading it to my daughter at bedtime. It weighs a ton and the pages are large, which makes it uncomfortable to balance and hard to read. I actually was on Amazon tonight looking to buy some of the individual books; I think they're the way to go, if you're planning on reading these stories to a young child. If you're just looking to have a great anthology of Dr. Seuss to read to yourself or collect, then this is your book."
3,one big book,"My 15 month old loves Dr. Seuss so we thought this would be great. Unfortunately, we didn't realize it was one big book - we thought it was 13 individual books. It is too cumbersome to read with a toddler so we are returning it."
3,Your Favorite Dr. Seuss,"We all love Dr. Suess and I thought this would be a great deal to get 13 stories to read to my 1 and 3 year olds for bedtime stories. The problem is that the book is too big to cuddle up with on the couch with two little ones. We returned it and bought a few of the smaller, 1 story, Dr. Suess classics."
4,Good buy,I agree with some reviewers that it is too big to be comfortable reading it on a chair.However - having all of the stories in one book makes it worth it. We lay on the floor with the book open in front of us and it is great.
4,A good tool for culture and grammar,"Ensuite is a good textbook giving the students a very nice overview of the French and francophone cultures, using original texts from francophone authors as well as well-chosen articles. The grammar section will please those who think about grammar as an important part of a French class for intermediate students. The 6 units are well-built, with 3 chapters each, and will allow students to discuss intersting topics in class. A drawback might be the presentation, though. The chapters are heavily loaded with vocabulary, and it might be scary to students... Also, black and white pictures are not what you would expect from a $50 book. Otherwise, Ensuite is an enjoyable companion."
1,Terrible book,"Hello :I just got the book and I encounter a terrible thing. The book is in terrible conditions. It has water damages, the cover of the book is in a terrible shape and so te pages.. I will like to have it replace or my money back. I'm not happy with the book"
3,Only good if it fits your hand,I think for people with smaller hands you won't find this mouse comfortable. For me it started to cause wrist pains. I eventually got the Logitech Wheel Mouse Optical Black or basically any standard shaped mouse. The smaller size fits my hand better and doesn't cause it to arch back more than is necessary. The optical tracking is about the same so why pay more? Some of you might like the shape but I didn't.
5,I've had this mouse for 7 years and still love it!!,"I bought this mouse back in 2001 after reading a positive review in PC Mag. I've used it daily for 7 (yes SEVEN) years now and it works better to date than the new Dell optical mouse I use at the office. There are two rubber ""comfort"" strips on either side to rest your thumb on the left and pinky and ring finger on the right that have since disintegrated and come off, other than that it works like a charm; outlasting my previous computers!I initially thought that it felt a little bulky but I think that's because most other optical mouses are just too small. When you get used to the larger size and different shape of the mouse you'll appreciate its unique design as a ergonomic plus."
2,Made hair greasy.,"Products will respond to different hair types. I have curly, fine, highlighted hair. Yet it looks like I have a lot of hair when I wear it curly. I tried using this product sparingly but it still didn't do the job. There are other products in the market that work better. For styling, I like bumble and bumble curl conscious. For shine, Phyto makes a good a good shine spray. I also use biolage gelee which I really like. I've never gone wrong with ANY Kerastase product. However, B&B brilliantine product underperformed and unimpressed me."
3,Not the best Bumble and Bumble product out there.,"This product is OK, but must be used very sparingly, as hair can become a little sticky and limp."
1,didn't work for me,"This made my hair feel gunky, and I don't recommend it. Maybe for other hair types or styles, it would work, but I'd definitely try it out at a salon before buying it."
3,ok,Works well to give your hair texture but beware to only use a very small amount or you will want to take a shower all over again.
5,Stupendous!,"This is a must have for each and every Phish phan. Two nights of live music in thier entirety straight from the soundboard-WOW! Highlights: MIKE'S>SIMPLE>JAM>WEDGE! GIN>PIPER! FREE>HAHAHA>FREE>WEEKAPAUG! Along with wonderful interpretations of many classic phish songs, some fun covers and some great new tunes. I have much of '98 on CDR... this show is filled to the brim with positve energy and incredible playing. Support the band, buy the discs, sit back and enjoy :)"
4,Energy on CD,"Something that this band should do more of: Take an idea such as the Dick's Picks series and put out live stuff of their own. Case in point is this boxed set taken from two nights in Hampton, Va. This collection captures all the energy of a live Phish show without overdubbing or studio tinkering. This is basically it: capturing the raw energy, the humor, and the jamming that makes seeing this band live as special as it is. The setlists are pretty much standard fare with very few songs really stretching, but that's okay too because EVERYTHING here is extremely tight and well played. A perfect companion for ""A Live One"" and ""Slip Stitch and Pass""."
5,Quite Enjoyable,"The beauty of live music is hearing spontaneous genius. Granted, you do pick up some mistakes with this set, there is also a tremedous amount of excellent work. No matter how hard a studio tries, there is no possible way to duplicate live music in a studio.Phish is a band that is meant to be heard live. If they were a studio band, the radio would play much more Phish. Phish realizes that they are meant to be heard live, so they allow taping at shows. They also try to make higher fidelity recordings of the concerts available to the world. This box set, along with A Live One and Slip, Stitch, and Pass, records what Phish does best. Everyone will appreciate the Will Smith cover Gettin' Jiggy Wit It. It isn't a jam, but it is very funny. As a whole this box is a wonderful addition to anyone's music library."
1,Forget This! Check out the Live Phish series instead.,"God only knows why these two shows were chosen for official release. The song list looks promising, but in all honesty, I've never heard Phish sound more exhausted than on these discs. Trey in particular can't seem to get his fingers on the right frets or sing in key with the other members. For a band that prides itself on tight ensemble playing, dead-on vocal harmonies and quirky song structure, they truly blow it here. This album should never have been released. If you really want to hear what Phish could do on a good night, check out Live Phish 02, 01 & 06."
3,Phish Verite,"HCA realistically represents a Phish experience, containing both the good and the bad moments of a Phish show. More than anything though it seems to represent what makes Phish loved by its fans. The music is real, and every time that it is played it is unique. Yes, there are plenty of mistakes, but would any popular top 40 band be daring enough to put themselves in a situation to make a mistake? NO, unlike Phish, top 40 bands rely on the safety net of playing album cut renditions of their hits. Phish remains true to the music, expanding on it every time they play it. Sometimes it comes off well (Harry Hood, Bathtub Gin, Divided Sky) and sometimes not so good (Wilson, Stash). This is neither the best Phish show nor the worst one, but rather a typical example of what Phish has to offer. In the same sense, this box set is really only for true die hard fans, if you want a good Phish live experience go to a show, buy A Live One, or get some tapes."
4,Does Hampton REALLY Come Alive?,"As a long-time Phish fan with just short of two dozen shows under my belt, I was anticipating the release of HCA for quite some time. What I got did not let me down. Clearly, some discs in the 6-disc set are stronger than others, but overall, it's a great performance. Truth be known, this is NOT the finest Phish show, it's generally agreed that the Hampton 97 shows would've been a much better choice for release, but, if you like Phish, you won't be disappointed."
3,"could've, should've been better","All phish phans were eagerly awaiting the release of this set. The bottom line is, it did not live up to expectataions. However, this nonsense that the band wasn't ""on"" or made ""too many mistakes"" is ridiculous. The biggest problem is the sound or ""mix"", if you will. Mike Gordon is mixed way too low, which severely detracts from the Phish ""groove"" or ""phunk phactor"", which they seemed to work hard to develop post-'96.Also, the sound is dull; it lacks the brightness or sharpness of ""A Live One"" or ""Slip, Stich.."". I have tapes that sound better. The criticism of Trey's vocals or sloppy guitar playing is unjustified. This is not Bach. Trey plays great and sings great for this type of music. He is truly a talented musician and I look forward to future releases"
3,Finally a full concert,"The packaging is gimicky, and the number of covers is exorbitant. Yes, it is nice to hear phish's versions of some of these songs once or see them in concert, but most do not warrant future listen let alone having them on a cd. Additionally the cds are not to capacity, making a potentially shorter box set into a more expensive one. Ideally, I would have hoped for something more like the Dick's Picks series where you can pick up 4 cds for about $20. But I guess there is money to be made and at least it finally is an officially released full concert (or I guess a pair of them) that should more than please those that have had the opportunity to see them where they are the best: on the stage. I hope that in the future Phish will open up the vaults and begin to release some live stuff from the early 90's."
3,Not their best by far,"Recently started listening to phish again. I was turned off by round room and did not really recover until this summer. Awesome shows this summer reignited my interest. Today I put this on and it is just poor compared to even 2012 soundboards. I really wanted to give it two stars, but it's ok is a better description than I don't like it. It is not horrible, but it is not the best album to spend your $ on. If you are new to phish buy A Live One. If your not new to phish.......you probably have better soundboards already."
2,Phish Fails to Come Through,"There are lots reviews here by obviously hardcore phish phans, but guys, hey this is NOT THAT GOOD.The playing is sloppy, the recording is poor. And why did they leave in some of the huge moments of silence in the middle of tunes? Obviously the guys are doing something visual onstage, but, hey this is a CD, not a DVD.It also shows the tremendous weakness of Phishs recent material. Foam and Cavern, while not two of their strongest songs, blow away the more recent stuff. Guyute comes across as an outake from Caravans Cunning Stunts period (obligatory obscure Canterbury reference)I think these guys are having too much fun with their audience, and really have stopped growing, and this is/was a group with unlimited growth potential.Now I don't think many non-hardcore Phish fans will be buying a 6 CD set, this is most definately for hardcore Phish fans only.It is NOT the second coming, but a mediocre CD by a very good band."
1,Was It For This Mah Life I Sought,If you are looking for some insight on this. Believe me when i say don't waste your money.I bought this for 33 bucks from buynow.com and only wish i hadn't.Of all the possible shows from 98 why did they choose this.It gets five stars for sloppiness in my opinion.they obviously did not listen to this before releasing it.If your looking for some good quality 98 shows there are plenty out there.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY
4,Incredible live material,"This set captures Phish in their most natural setting-on the stage. This being the band's third live release in five years may cause some to think there is an overkill on the live material (although not as much as Dave Matthews). Being only somewhat of a phish fan, this set did me in completely. After hearing the first disc, I didn't think it could get any better, but it does! Excellent for Phish fans, but requires time and patience to truly appreciate."
4,"Good, but not as good as A Live One","This was an OK album, but I would have rather seen a night or 2 of the Island Tour instead of this for their new live album. The jams were so-so, but they weren't as long as they usually are, and none REALLY stood out. If you already have A Live One, you might want to get this album, if not, definitely pick up that instead."
2,Not The Best Phish Has To Offer,"Bought the 6 cd set last week, after a 14 hour drive (lots of time to listen) i have come to the conclusion this set by no means showcases the musical talents of this band and in fact if this was a first time hearing Phish I Would definately think of the band as a bunch of mediocre musicians playing obviously to a fan base who accepts anything released as great. Sorry guys, not a great work. Should have been a lot better for the money."
2,A poor choice,"Phish has played many excellent live shows in the last fifteen years or so and this is not one of them. 1998 was not a good year for the band, in my opinion. 1998 was a year of playing cover songs to make up for a lack of musical inspiration.(Which I think is shown by the lack of exciting improvisation and the excess of cover songs on these discs) Don't get me wrong- these discs do have some high points, but overall, I think that these Hampton shows were a poor choice for release when there are so many more impressive and enjoyable shows out there.(including other shows from this same Hampton venue)"
5,Phish never Phails to come through,"This album (box set) features an eclectic mix of many phish classics such as stash and divided sky, newer works from the recent story of the ghost album as well as favorites that were previously commercially un released like posssum and new tracks like farmhouse. However, whether it be new or old Phish constantly comes through as it always does for its phanatics. A must buy, enjoy!"
2,Why doesn't this work with the iPod Touch???,"My daughter got one of these for her Ipod a year ago. She just upgraded to the iPod Touch, which uses the same charging cable. But when she plugs the Touch into this adapter, it says ""Charging is not supported with this accessory""So what do we need to be able to charge and play the new Touch?"
2,Not to happy,I order this product that's clearly marked 24 pak. I only received 22. Other thin that the order was on time.
3,Bought them for a friend,"They looked everywhere for these and couln't find them in any store. He gave me one, but it didn't last long, about a week and that's it."
3,"An entertaining, well-paced Florida pioneer adventure.","An excellent read for those who like Westerns or pioneer adventures, Thunder on the St. Johns is written in a style that combines some of Zane Grey's style of word artistry with the concise, to the point structure used by Louis L'Amour. The book is faithful to Florida's geography and history, and is a taut, well written fictional account of early Florida pioneer adventures with a decidedly Western flavor. The plot centers around a gambler, some settlers, and outlaw bands headed to Florida for escape, settlement, and conquest. These conflicting aims lead to deadly confrontations from start to finish. The plot is tense, credible, and written against a picturesque background rich in descriptions of the terrain and typical events in Florida's pioneer days. Florida was ""western"" before the west was ""western"", and this book is one of several which give the reader insight into one aspect of Florida's turbulent pioneer days."
4,"Five star music, four star collection","Of course, this is John Renbourn music, and incredible stuff for those who appreciate his amazing guitar playing and arranging. But as a collection, it's not at all complete - it ends in the early 1970s, thus missing a good chunk of his evolving career. And the track organization seems to me strangely organized and spotty, with some remarkable tracks missing and other less brilliant work filling in.The best use i've found for it is to feed the entire 2-cd set into a large collection of MP3 albums for shuffle play. That, and it's a cheap way to get a lot of John Renbourn. But if you're a fan, you're better off buying real albums."
1,BAD,I haven't filled the basket more than 3 times and it stopped working. Don't get it. Spend the money on something a little nicer.
1,Do not waste your money.,"With this Royal shredder, I have the same problems, e.g. jams, noisy sound, etc, that others already mentioned. In addition, this shredder is not safe. One day, it got jammed with cross-cut papers. When I pressed the reverse button, I heard a crack. Next thing I knew was that the cutting part cut open its plastic cover. I wish I could scan and post a picture of this broken shredder on this review so that other customers would see it."
1,GARBAGE,"That's where this shredder belongs. It barely holds 20 pages of shredded material and it jams at least twice for every basket full. Oh yeah, you can get a desktop shredder with a full size slot at Staples for half the price."
1,Danger,"Mine blew up in my face. Literally. Although it is 3 years old, it should not have exploded as it did. I was lucky not to be injured since it was only 2 feet from my head. Called thier 800 number and was on hold for 10 mins before they cut me off. Beware of this product..."
3,Unhappy with design,"This poker set would be perfect, however, the person who designed it must not play poker. The bottom two chips in each slot are tough to remove. Especially the last one. The slots need to be drilled down to below the chip level to make it easier."
2,I wouldn't waste my money,Just go to a poker chip website and you can get 300 9.0 gram clay chips with a case for only about $15 to $20 more than this set.
5,Thought Provoking,"This audio book is excellent. It's based on the notion that human knowledge is much more limited than we'd like to think. Because of this problem we're likely to ignore information that doesn't fit with our current preconceptions. We're even unaware of possible limitations on our ability to understand some kinds of phenomena.Our approach to science often requires us to build on existing knowledge. To the extent that this knowledge is incorrect, so are the conclusions we make. Until we begin to take the approach that Dr. Hein does here and entertain new and different ideas, we are likely to continue to delude ourselves about the extent and breadth of human knowledge."
2,a disappointment,I found a few of his ideas to be interesting - but it was mostly a rehash of already printed ideas....and some ideas were outlandish
4,A Hit With a Finicky Eater,The only treat my fussy Siamese will eat. I don't mind. These are actually good for her and don't upset her otherwise sensitive stomach.
3,SO-SO!!!,My kitty's ate these at first but soon tired of them. Since I bought a whole box I have to alternate with Natural Temptations in order for these not to be wasted. My vet sells these treats for a lot more than what Amazon charges!!!
1,Royal PL 2000 laminator,"This is truly a poor product. About every third or fourth time I have used it it jams. I have managed to fix it by literally taking it apart, not easy and time consuming, and unclogging the paper. The last time, however, it became impossible to clear the mess. And, there is no trouble-shooting help to assist with this reoccuring situation. It now is headed for the dumpster. There is really no excuse for such a poorly functioning product. I note other users have had very similar problems."
2,Nice but problems,"This laminator is a very nice product, BUT, After the 5th time I used it the item I was laminating disappeared!! This machine started eating the items I was laminating. After that it would not work anymore!"
1,I got what I paid for!! Cheap Price/ Poor Quality,"The very first time I used this machine, it jammed!!! I was able to use it about three more times(with at least one jam each time) before it jammed and stopped working completely. Thus, I got a total of four laminating projects( three or less items laminated at each project) before the final fatal jam. This final fatal jam has rendered the unit useless and even after taking the unit apart and clearing the jam, the unit will not work!!! This machine seems like a bargain, but this ends up costing me about $15 for each of the four laminating projects I was able to complete before the unit became useless!!!!Spend the extra dollars and get a laminator that provides quality and is dependable!!!Oh, forget about the warranty; I can't find any place to have it repaired because the repair will cost more than the unit cost and there is no real hope that it will even work properly after the repair is complete!!!!!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I got this last Christmas to make a small project for my daycare. It jammed after the first couple of half-sized pieces of paper were laminated. I was able to clear that jam and it worked for a couple more minutes. But then came the fatal jam. It sucked in the paper and I have yet to find where it went. It is trapped inside of it somewhere. I tried to take it completely apart, but don't have the skill to do it without breaking the whole thing. I called around to find someone to fix it, but everyone said it would be cheaper to buy a new machine.It's possible that I just got a bad machine. But I did wait several minutes between laminating sheets and I didn't try to laminate anything that was too thick."
1,JUNK,My fancy little laminator worked for about 40 laminations and the motor burned up. I jammed about half the time anyway.I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,Fair to poor,"I first purchased this at Costco. The first one died after a month of use, but I did get about a hundred laminations through it. The second one I did not use as much and after a year of sitting on my shelf I took it down to use it. I turned it on and forgot it for a couple of days. The motor burned out. Other brand lamination did not work very well. If you don't use it much, treat it gently and don't leave it on, it may be ok for you. Good luck!"
1,A waste of money,"This was a total waste of money. Like the other users have complained in their reviews, this thing eats the documents that are fed into it. Twice I have had to pull stuff out and the document was all folded up and ruined. The third time something got caught, I managed to get the document out, but the motor was ruined. The laminator would heat up, but wouldn't advance the document. I will be buying another type of laminator because I need one, but will never buy another Royal laminator."
5,fun and geometric-intuition-minded,"A must for anyone entering the field of three-dimensional topology and geometry. Most of it is about hyperbolic geometry, which is the biggest area of research in 3-d geometry and topology nowdays.Most of it is readable to undergraduates. Its target audience, though, is beginning graduate students in mathematics. If not already familiar with hyperbolic geometry, you might want to get an introduction to the subject first. Once with this background, though, you will discover there is another level of understanding of hyperbolic space you never realized was possible. One imagines Thurston able to skateboard around hyperbolic space with the kind of geometric understanding he conveys here.What made Thurston so famous and successful as a pioneer in 3-d topology and geometry was his other-worldly geometric intuition. This book takes the reader along the first step of the 10000 miles of getting to that intuition."
3,"a decent book, but","FAR worse than Thurston's classic notes, whence it came. Covers very little material by comparison, and has a lot more bogus ""explanations"". Given that the notes are available for free from Math. Sciences Research Inst. (MSRI), in convenient PDF form (for usKindle DX Wireless Reading Device (9.7"" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)andApple iPad MB292LL/A Tablet (16GB, Wifi)users, this is not a great book to get."
2,Not for sensative skin,These are very rough--after I washed them---it became hard a stone---I would not purchase them again. Keep in my I have sensative skin
2,Doesn't work as well as it could.,I have a back scrubber that's made of a braid of artificial loofah material that works much better than this did.The natural sea sponge isn't very flexible even when wet and the Terry part is only really there as an anchor for the loofah.All in all I probably wouldn't buy this if I had a chance to try it first.
5,Swing me baby!,"Just saw this show on Broadway a few months ago, and was compelled to buy the cd on the wasy out of the theatre. An amazing production, Anne and Everett are fantastic. Fully intended this show to be my 'Smokey Joe's Cafe' surrogate, which made the appearance of J.C. Montgomery first on a nice surprise. This recording fully captures the energy and power of the show, now if only Sony would consider DVD:)........."
4,Unusual,I bought this CD on the assumption that it was just a compilation of music pieces. It is but they are pieces for a musical play as opposed to ordinary music pieces.
2,"I was so disappointed with the ""Oh My G---!!"" in lyrics","I bought this for my son and we won't be listening to it because I don't appreciate the ""Oh My G---!"" Why do they have to ruin a good CD. I know it doesn't bother some people, but if it bothers you, DON'T BUY. I just wasted my money...."
1,Not durable.,"I put these lights in and they looked great initially. But then slowly over the course of the next 2 or 3 months, the bulbs all slowly went out. And now tonight I find the transform is also non-functional. I love their pumps, but what were they thinking with these lights?While checking the bulbs I found every single one of them had a considerable amount of moisture inside the housing - not supposed to happen! they do have o-rings around the top of the lid, but apparently they don't work very well... I'd pass on this one folks. Hopefully Laguna will send me a replacement under warranty."
2,Get what you pay for,"Cord between lights was way to short, you get about a foot of cord between lights. If your ok with that read on.Its not a clean white light like other LED lights I have had but has a yellowish hue to it. There are colored lens caps included, ONE of each color so unless you want a rainbow effect they are useless. Plus once you put the lens caps on it cuts the light down dramatiacally.Had a light burn out a couple weeks after purchase, leaky lens cover.Still gave it 2 stars because it does turn on at night, of during day and some of the lights still work. Not a high quality item by any stretch of the imagination but what do you expect for the $$?"
5,One of the Best Military Games Ever,"Operation Flashpoint was one of the best military games ever to come out for PC, and this is pretty much just a direct port of that game over to Xbox. So, if you have already played all the missions on PC, they're all here, unchanged on the Xbox version, so you might be a little bored with itOther than that, this game is perfect. You hear some people bitch because the graphics aren't Halo level or whatever, but they're fine and really the fact that things look a little hazy farther away adds to the realism.If you never played Operation Flashpoint on PC, I can't recommend this game highly enough. Ghost Recon was basically just a Flashpoint rip off, and Flashpoint does it better and offers you a more open ended experience, especially when compared with Ghost Recon 2 and its add ons."
2,A Janky Mess.,"This game is marred by awkward, touchy controls and ugly visuals.Grabbed this in hopes of having a solid military sim on console. While the game takes pride in providing a relatively hardcore experience in this respect, poor aiming more than does the job at turning your time with the game into an infuriating one. With a shooter, especially on a controller, you need the aiming to be as precise and smooth feeling as possible. It really just makes most engagements a chore to take on.Add ugly, muddy visuals with lots of fogging and you have a product that neither plays well, nor is it anything to look at.Sadly, I say avoid. Even with the lack of proper military sims on console, this one simply is not worth your time."
3,great potential...just falls short,"I bought this game a couple weeks before Christmas hoping it would sufice my appetite for a good first person shooter(at least until Christmas rolled around). My first and immediate complaints are the horrible graphics and sound. Graphics look as though the game was actually made during the Cold War and the voice overs are monotonous and knda goofy. The guns sound like cap guns and I've noticed no echoes. The controls are choppy and hard to get used to. Despite the bad graphics and horrible sound, the game is actually somewhat fun. Some of the missions are cool, and I enjoy the tactial approach. After playing graphically advanced games such as Halo 2 and the new Perfect Dark on the 360, I find it difficult to look past Flashpoints short commings and even more difficult not to say the game is already outdated. BEWARE!"
1,DISSAPOINTING!,This game has got to have the worst graphics I have ever seen. Ive seen n64 graphics better then this. Its a very bad game and tries to be realistic but if repeating everything twice in the game is realistic then it wins that award. What do you mean your probably saying? Well when one of your fellow squad members says something he constantly says it over and over. All you hear is enemie 3 clock. enemie 3 clock! got him!got him! Dont even look at this game on the shelf.
4,"The box & labeling startled me initially, however, I am currently rating it at 4 1/2 stars!!!","I initially thought I had received a different brand, since the box was a Panasonic box & the cartridges did not have an Epson label. I did compare it to my current Epson cartridges & they are identical in size & design. I have not inserted one yet as I don't like to wait until the ink is all gone before I order."
4,ink,"use this ink with my epson 1270 for the past 10 year ,still gets my great 8x10 photos,i have on my wall photo from 2001 and no fading to reporte"
3,"Pricey ink, but works.","I use the Epson T009201 color ink on my venerable Epson Stylus Photo 900. It works well, though I occasionally have to do a ""head cleaning"" run if it sits awhile.Like all printer ink, it is horribly overpriced. Equally annoying are the ""low ink"" warnings you receive LONG before the cartridge is empty. I can still print out 100+ pages of text or several 8x10 glossy photos after the first warning. As if we weren't getting gouged enough . . ."
3,good,"the ink fades if exposed to sunlight, which can be sad, but the epson 1270 prints beautiful photos."
3,Like we have a choice?,"...Anyway: The color ink qualifies for free shipping, the black does not. Go figure. And if you mix them, the whole order is disqualified from free shipping. ....As to quality, please stop groveling over the fact that a printer can print a picture in color. Yes, cheap, great quality printing HAS arrived. Calm down.Price: the a-zon matches the lowest available. Yes other place are steeper. No there is no substitute. You use the manufacturers ink and all goes smoothly. Anything else in my 5+ years and thousands of dollars of ink purchasing experience will result in endless cleaning cycles, having to unclog the jets, etc. Don't go there.But pullleeease don't grovel...people--its just an ink cartridge."
3,CAN'T SEEM TO LOCATE INK FOR MY EPSON STYLUS 777,"PLEASE SHOW ME WHERE TO BUY INK FOR MY PRINTER, BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THE TO17 AND TO18 CARTRIDGES MENTIONED ON MY PLASTIC BAG THAT MY ORIGINAL INK CAME IN.> PLEASE HELP< THANK YOU."
2,Rangefinder not accurate,I found the optics on this range finder to be excellent but the rangefinder aspect was very poor for me. I never got an accurate reading on the golf course and sometimes it was off almost 100 yards. It may be that it was picking up other targets but that was not satisfactory for me. As a result I returned it.
2,Disappointed,"Should have bought Sky Caddie. The Nikon is not dependable to give accurate readings Usually takes several attempts to get a distance that is even in the ball park, and by then all confidence in the readout is gone."
4,Works best with a steady hand,"This rangefinder has worked quite well for me so far, but it helps to brace your hand on a cart or golf bag on distances over 150 yards. It would be nice if they could add some kind of stabilization software. When pins have reflectors, finding a pin distance is quite easy but I will check 3-4 times and go with the most consistent number, sometimes it will pick up something behind or in front of green but by checking several times I get a confident measurement withing plus or minus 1 yard. It's great for those of us who do not always play from the center of the fairway or at courses that have very large greens where there is a difference of 1-2 clubs from front to back pin settings."
5,He loved it!,This was the item my boyfriend wanted for Christmas. He loved it. It was exactly what he wanted and I now know how far all of my neighbors live from my home. :)
3,Nikon Laser Caddy 500G,I have found that you need a very steady hand (much better than mine)as any movement from the flagstick will get variable readings. Clutter behind the flagstick will also cause variations in the proper yardage. I have only used it a few times as it takes more time to use than its' value.
4,God is in the details,"More terrific stuff from Bloom. To me, she's an absolute master of telling details: food, clothing and pop culture touchstones. I particularly loved her invocation of Joe E. Brown and the late great Jack Lemmon in the title story. (I did notice, though, that she seems to be overly fond of sleeping spoon-style, cornbread, and distinctive buttock birthmarks). There are worlds in these stories, and it's a privelege to enter them. The only story that didn't work for me was the final one, 'The Story', but I've never been particularly receptive to meta-fiction. The collection remains a must-read for lovers of the short story."
3,A Blind Man Can See....,"The only way to describe this book and the short stories it contains is disturbing. The stories are all so unfamiliar I did not enjoy reading them. While her prose was wonderful, the stories did not live up to the title or cover. The title is beautiful as is the cover, the stories within are disturbing and at times do not make any sense."
1,A Disappointment,"After reading ""Come to Me"" (several times!) I eagerly awaited Ms. Bloom's new collection of short stories. When I first picked up ""A Blind Man.."" I was a bit uneasy to see artwork of a naked woman on the cover (isn't that a sure sign that Marketing thinks some extra ""oomph"" is needed to sell the book?) but I bought it anyway, since I had been blown away by ""Come to Me."" But what a sad waste of money. I made it throught the whole thing, but barely. None of these stories grabbed me or made me think. And the characters were neither interesting nor believable. I was left wanting much more. Hopefully her next effort will be more like her first."
5,She's A Wonderful Storyteller!,"""A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You"" by Amy Bloom is a wonderful collection of short-stories. Her brilliant use of language, texture, and storytelling lead the reader on a course of discovery. Each selection and character is well-rounded and multi dimensional. She doesn't cut corners on any story or persona that is expressed. She can tell a story like no one else. She has such a talent for condensing a very involved story and breaking it down to it's core and making it so powerful that you want to continue with them for years to come. You have a real belief that these characters that Bloom created are so strong, that they will survive even faced with the sad and difficult circumstances they faced. She makes you believe in compassion and ultimate success. A wonderful collection and well worth the money."
5,Artful Writing and Poetic Cover,"Author Amy Bloom continues to display mastery of the short story form. The collection of eight compelling stories is inhabited by real people, flawed and admirable, struggling to overcome obstacles confronted throughout life; the characters are revealed slowly and surely by an author who displays rare insight and compassion. The richly subtle photograph on the book jacket is a visual poem that speaks of both vulnerability and hope -- an image that reflects the insights of the psychotherapist/author."
4,good images,"This book has a decent selection of heraldic designs different from Dover selection. Just wish it came with a CD, then I would give it a 5."
4,"Excellent, but suited for more advanced climbers","Ok, I'm fairly new to outdoor climbing, and if I got into some of the situations described here, I would just hang on the rope and scream like a little girl until someone more experienced told me what to do.That said, if you're willing to spend several hours practicing the techniques, this book will boost your confidence considerably. I think it's more applicable to multipitch climbs, however the techniques are applicable to rappelling as well.Don't expect to read it and know how to traverse a knot while rappelling. Until you try the techniques a few times and get familiar, you shouldn't trust them while on the rock."
2,Mostly boring,"I really enjoy watching Sex in the City but somehow this wannabe was just annoying. However I did enjoy ""Enticing"" by Carrie Alexander. Somehow it did not come off as shallow as the other two."
3,Three good stories,"These three stories revolve around three women and an annual new years party thrown by a Choo-esque shoe designer. The short stories were VERY short, there was little time to develop the characters into people with whom the reader could relate. It was as hot as one would expect from a Harlequin Blaze title, but overall it struck me as a little too ""Sex In The City"" wannabe."
5,Easy GED Book,"A great beginner's brush up book,the great thing is having access to the answers and also supplying the methods of how to solve the problems. Very easy book."
4,Not working? Read here.,"Out of the box, this gadget didn't give enough of a charge to work. My version includes 4 electrodes, grouped in two pairs, but only two conductive pads. I hooked up the pads to one pair -- no luck. To create an effective circuit, you'll need to attach a pad to one electrode from each pair.Pros:Ridiculously cheapAC and USB adapter! Though your laptop will zap you if you touch it.Handy instructions booklet with garbled translations of Chinese acupressure theory.Cons:No fully manual control: frequency and wavelength."
4,Good gadget,"You will enjoy it......just remember that the first time you feel it, it makes you jump! Then you'll feel the benefit."
5,Almost like the ones at the chiropractor,The instructions are the worst but it only took a few minutes to figure it out. Just put the pads where you would have them applied at the chiropractor. Then push the on/off button. Then you push mode . Then you push strong. Try that for a second and push mode again .push strong again and it restarts in the new mode. The cupping mode is the most like the one I use at the chiropractor.
5,Acupuncture Machine,Made the mistake of buying one of these machines at a much higher price. This was was ever bit as good and cost a lot less. I would recommend to anyone having joint pain.
3,its alright,You get your money worth but ifs deffenitly not high quality. It arrived before the scheduled time which made me super happy.
2,STRONG,"i dono wether it was just mine but even on low settings it stong like nothing else, mabye it was just mine though"
3,Cheap,Cheap machine and very difficult to get replacement pads. Did not work for me shipped it back . You get what you pay for.
4,Item was just what you would expect,"The item arrived. It is simple, easy and it is exactly what you would expect for the price. The only complaint about the product is the lowest power setting is pretty strong, then again I bought this to use on my wrists for carpel tunnel, not on my back or legs. The lowest power setting is NOT too strong for those areas."
4,Stopped working after 5 uses,**Edited 7/31**This seller was great to work with. I got a replacement unit in the mail 2 weeks later. Thanks.This thing broke after I used it less than 5 times and I'm still on my first set of electrode pads. it just won't turn on anymore.
5,Great,For the price i did not expect much but is great i have not had one bit of problem with it. Has a cheap feel to it but that dont matter it dose its job makes my body feel relaxed after using it. I had my mom use it she thought she had carpull tunnel an used it once an hasnt had a problem wit it since. Glad i bought it
4,Electro Massager,"Powerful output. Original pads almost burn the skin at any setting higher than two. Resolved this issue by using pads for my Prospera instead. Because single channel output is more powerful, feel no need for the two-channel Prospera unit I was using which had gotten weaker with age. Unit first comes up in chinese, but is switchable to english. I would recommend this unit."
4,Very pleased,"For such a low price I figured I'd take a shot. After testing this little device out a few times, I'm glad I did.This digital therapy machine comes in a very small package and looks and even feels somewhat flimsy but once you put the batteries in and turn it on, you're in for a nice surprise.The power of the pulsations is more than I had expected and should, in my opinion, be good enough to do the job for just about anyone.The only real drawbacks are the fact that you have to change the language setting to be able to feature the controls in English and that the user manual is not as informative as it should be."
4,DAP is Miracle Healer,I used the DAP on self for back treatment and frozen shoulders and found it amazing.I have recovered a lot and would recommend to others who need immediate relief from pain.I bought for $28.84 which i wish had been lower as offered to me now at $12.84.
3,digital massager,"This device is one of the very cheapest I have found, BUT IT WORKS ! Three criticisms, the most severe is that the instrucions are ONLY in Chinese ! (but it's interesting to experiment) the contact between one electrode and it's pad is very intermittent, and the massage programme hiccups from time to time.BUT WHAT CAN ONE EXPECT FOR THIS SORT OF PRICE ?The above was my first impression. Now I find the last two faults were caused by a faulty pad. After replacing it the device now works PERFECTLY ! I am delighted !Two tips:1. Don't lie on or put pressure on the pads. Itseems to concentrate the charge to a small area under the press-stid. It then bites !!2. start at level 2 or 3 and THEN increase the charge to whatever you need....... I've had it up to level 14,so far....WHEEZAPPEROONY! a masochist's delight !!!!"
4,digital therapy machine,"Definitely can feel a little difference in sore muscles after 1 use. I don't think this would be for everyone. It has an odd sensation, like a vibration with little pinches. I had to get use to it for awhile before I could leave it on any of the settings for very long. After awhile I could leave it on a setting and even turn up the intensity, but I never went past 4 and it can go up to 15. After experimenting and figuring it out I used it for 15 mins on my lower back and another 15 mins on my upper. I found it to be relaxing as long as I lay down, moving around would make it start feeling like pinches and a bit uncomfortable."
5,wonderful product,This product is great. I've used this in physical therapy before for previous injuries. Now I have one for home use. It's very strong at level 1. Just get your own set of triple A batteries because the ones they provide are weak. Once you get a pack of duracell or something then you feel the power. Otherwise its a great product.
1,Broke after 2 uses,"Item broke after 2 uses. It worked ok until then. It had to be thrown away, could not be fixed."
4,good,i use this to help with back pain and also on my abs. its not as strong as a TENS unit. but it does the job and is worth the price that i paid. It helps when i have knots in my back. i just change the settings and let it do its magic.
1,A weak piece of junk!,Don't buy this! Spend more-get more! Very weak power..little sensation. Not worth squat! Not worth returning...in the garbage it goes!
1,Only lasted a week,I liked the product but after just one week it won't work. Besides that it was a great product .
3,Help,"Just got it...can't get to work though. The timer is working, but not feeling anything. increased intensity no result. any suggestions?"
1,Digital Acupuncture Physiotherapy Machine,"Garbage machine turns on but doesn't do what its suppose to do maybe the pads are broken IDK , not too much of a lose only paid little over ten bucks...."
2,It's just painful,"When I used the machine on my thigh it felt like a million little pinchs. To understand the feeling grab a handful of your hair and start pulling side to side as fast as you can but, the machine is more painful. All the pain seemed to be near the skin. It's strange but, I didn't feel anything in the muscle. I used all the different modes but, even on the low setting there was just a painful pinching. On the arm or the leg just a pinching feeling is what you get.I wish I never used it"
2,Acupuncture Machine,"The device only contains 2 pads, am I supposed to use it once and then throw my 30 something dollars away?? replacements for this pads seem impossible to get, so before buying it think it twice."
1,Doesn't work??,"Ok I just opened it, plugged it in, put in the batteries, turned it on connected the electrodes and pads and nothing??Changed the intensity, nothing, changed the mode, nothing?? Am I doing something wrong??"
3,Does help,"I have nerve damage and this is helping. Maybe it is my nerve problem, but I can't feel the weak setting at all. I just saw what looks like the same thing for a lot less. Electronic Digital Massage by Health Herald $19.50 So I am a little upset I paid so much."
1,"Horrible ""TENS"" unit if that's what you're looking for",I purchased this Machine for $12 and thought I was going to get something good for a quarter of the price. I'm Athletic Trainer and I also work in a physical therapy clinic and I know how a tens unit should feel. This machine doesn't let you choose your comfort level. I think there's 10 levels of strength and I can only get to about level 4 before the machine starts hurting like hell! I like TENS units with a adjustable know that can change the frequency. This machine goes from one level to the next too quickly which is painful. I did not enjoy this machine at all.
2,Not very adjustable,"This product feels cheap when you get it and you see soon that it is cheap. This product does work but due to being cheaply built it is not very adjustable and the pads have to be VERY well attached to your skin or it will shock you and that burns and hurts. Don't waste your time and money on an inferior item, go ahead and spend the money to get a nicer one."
3,Another Chinese Toy,Different but interesting. Acupuncture label is misleading as pads are large & unspecific & could never pinpoint exact acupuncture point locations. There are 7 other modes but they all seem to be variations of TENS massage. The intensity varies & is intermittent. It's easy to overzap yourself. Comes with 3 small AAA batteries & don't know how long they will last. As a positive. just sitting with pads under your feet is a very pleasant. relaxing experience.
5,You'll never be the same!,"I never dreamed a book about gardening could be so profoundly inspiring. The photographs are award winning quality but it is Amy Goldman's inspiring text that makes this book so remarkable. Your heartbeat will quicken as you search her seed sources for these little known melons. It will be hard to wait until next spring when you can ""spring into action"". The French will no longen be the only ones to enjoy the delights of these culinary treasures."
1,Some things you shouldn't mess with...,"Dumas is one, particularly if you cannot do better. The authors tried to add some supernatural elements to this story and ended up with a long, disjointed film which probably would have been better as a two-parter. Further, the film is not in English. If you watch in English, the characters' lip movements and the dialogue you hear are so disjointed the effect becomes laughable. The swordplay is beyond unrealistic as well---just one of those extended play battles where the directors clearly have no clue what an actual sword battle is. Give me the original movie."
1,See the '74 Version; avoid this one at all costs.,"I have been an admirer of both Dumas' novel and the lovely Emmanuelle Beart for many years. I was therefore overjoyed when I saw this film on the shelf. Sadly, it is the very worst sort of dreck. The filmmakers decided to ""improve upon"" Dumas' story by introducing supernatural sorcery, and Hong Kong wire work for the swordfights. Madame Beart portrays Milady De Winter as Satanically-possessed (I must assume that the producers were too). The film is only available as a dubbed-in English version, which adds a measure of hilarity. There are so many versions of Dumas' novel, but only one that is worth seeing: the Three/Four Musketeers films of 1973/74, starring Charlton Heston and Michael York."
5,WOW! Nice twist on an old classic!,"Wow, long movie, great footage, fantastic twist on the story!The lip-syncing was evident throughout as it wasn't a native English flick but definately worthy of any Musketeers fan collection!"
1,"I Don't Write That Many Reviews, But...","This book was SO bad I wanted to jump in here and say so. I'd never read this author before. The characters are one-dimensional, if that's possible. The dialogue is SO unbelievable that I found myself laughing out loud at the conversations between the characters.I'm a mystery reader, and a horror reader, and this book delves into the romance genre a little bit, so it's a little outside of my usual genre. I usually read Dean Koontz, James Patterson, Michael Connelly, Robert B. Parker, Jonathan Kellerman, etc.I got halfway through this disaster before I couldn't take any more and quit. I can't think of ever having quit a book before.I think Sala writes at a 3rd grade level, the plot is just plain stupid, and the writing is just so plain bad it is almost an insult to the reader.Stay away."
3,"Very good, but not mind blowing.","I first saw the video for ""Smash it Up"" on 120 minutes, and thought this has to be one of the best bands ever. I proably went into the album with two much expectation, it is very good but not what I wanted it to be. Musicaly alot of it sounds like American Matador label type stuff like Jon Spencer, lyricaly it is good but it is hard to make the connection between alot of the simple generic phrases in the songs and the supposed political meanings behind them. It is definiantly an album worth buying , but it is not the wake-up call to rock 'n' Roll that I thought it would be. I also thought the album might be a little more eclectic like some of the Refused stuff. Worth buying though partly for the music, partly for the ultra-cool Swede aura around it."
4,Informative and not too long.,"This wasn't exactly what I was looking for as I was really wanting an in-depth look at just the traditions of Day of the Dead. However, I bought a few videos on this subject from Amazon and THIS ONE was by far the most informative on Dia de los Muertos and general Mexican Culture. It also was only 60 minutes, so I can see it being useful for classroom showing.If Day of the Dead is the subject you're looking for, you'll have to suffer through the culinary approach they take (as the name of the movie implies)...meaning there are lots of scenes were the two guys are scorging the local markets and sampling local delicacies. But it is interesting to see them eat from a century plant and I won't even mention the bugs. haha!!!"
5,excellent,Top quality treatment of the material. Have used it in the class room with great success. I recommend the film!
3,Over-simplified,"Interesting look at the role of food in Mexico, but it fails to address important issues such as hunger, malnutrition, and changing diets (fast food, industrial foods, and excess sugar and fat consumption) that are challenging these traditions."
4,Mid-60s recordings,"This CD was released by the now defunct Velvet Records, so it is officially discontinued, although stock obviously remains. The 12 tracks here come from 2 different albums, half the titles from 1965, the other half from 1966. The group is still going strong here, and there are some excellent tracks like La Playa, En Una Flor and Venecia Sin Ti. The companion volume, EN ACCION, also on Velvet Records, covers the same years, and it's equally recommended, although it may be hard to find by now."
3,Disappointed,"My mother brought my sister, cosin and myself this toy. It came with some software. most of which we do not like.Now my mother has been looking everywhere for juiceware and is having problems finding what we like. Everyone do not like ed edd and eddy, billy and mandy or wrestling. I feel the money could been used some where else. I am disappointed with this toy because the company made it seem so easy to get the software and so. It is so bad when the company cannot help or even have the software they suppose to make."
3,clean connection if they matched my ride.,"Make sure these are the ones you need. I had to order from Crutchfield to get the right ones for my Jeep Wrangler 02. Crutchfield gave a perfect fit for more $$ obviously. You can order the right clips(I highly recommend to simplify things) or cut the clip off and hardwire. Then guess what one is positive and negative. Don't hardwire it unless you really don't give a care.... IF these did fit, they do feel quality enough for me to use. I didn't return them. I think they may fit the front clips but, not what I needed for now. I needed the sound bar aftermarket speaker connection harness."
1,Does not fit 99 jeep wrangler,"Bought this product because it says it will fit a 99 jeep wrangler, but wrong, it will not fit 99 jeep wrangler. wasted my money."
5,Works on 2002 Jeep Cherokee,"Hey all, highly recommend you go to the manufacturer's web site and confirm whether these work on your car/truck. Simplified installation and no need to cut any wires. Got the job done, rated 5 stars as I knew what I was getting, if you want to go cheap, just don't buy them."
3,Need more information!!,I purchased these speaker harness for my son's 02 dodge neon but they didn't work. The male fitting that attach to the factory speakers were to big and wouldn't connect. I even called Metra and asked a tech if these were the right ones and he said yes. I ended up cutting the plugs off and spliced the connector tips into the speaker wires. They work now. I have ordered the other speaker harness for the 01 neon (72-6512) to see if they're compatible to the rear deck speakers. Hopefully they'll work.
1,Don't waste your money,"I had two, both lasted about a month. The gears on the inside are plastic and break easily. I never put in more than two sheets of paper, which the machine could had trouble handling."
1,POOR,I have had this shredder for about a year. Never fed more than two or three sheets into it. Well it locked up and when I took it apart I found out why...Plastic Gears!. As mentioned in other reviews can not find any web site for the company as if I could get the gears I could fix it myself. I will definitely look for a shredder that has metal gears and can be used a bit more before stripping itself!
1,Stripped gears!,"Like everyone else, my gears are stripped. I am searching for replacement gears. Worthless!"
1,Wish I had researched it first,"[....]I used the shredder for nothing but light duty home operation. After a few months, the gears are stripped and completely useless. Now I have a [...]wastebasket."
1,Shred this shredder!,"Bought one new, used it no more than 2-3 times a month on average. Within 2 months, the auto paper detect stopped working, so I had to manually turn the machine on and off. The unit died after 4 months and could not get any warranty assistance. The papers that I wanted to destroy lasted longer than this shredder..."
1,Disappointing Performance,"This shredder lasted about one month, or maybe 500 pages, before it started skipping its gears. It wasn't abused as far as I know(home office). It just seemed to very prematurely wear out..."
1,Royal Disappointment!!!,"After several uses the Royal Orca Shredder began to shred itself... What a poorly manufactured product! The internal housing screws which held gears and motor in place, came loose and caused continual malfunctions - such as, gear teeth began stripping and breaking off, unit would so misalign that it would cause its safety shutoff to activate and shutdown in mid-shred, broken gear teeth would cause major lockups and unit would freeze. Very poorly made!"
1,Don't buy Royal!!!,"I had a 3500 that died after about 6 months of light-duty use (no more than about 5 pages a day). It made a grinding noise like the gears were being stripped. I had their smaller unit before that, which died after six months of undetermined causes. Do not buy this product. Read the other comments here on Amazon; if you are an attorney, Royal would make an excellent class-action law suit."
1,Poorly designed and unreliable,"After slightly more than a year of very moderate use, one of the drive gears lost several teeth. The gear train is poorly designed and not up to the task (I'm a mechanical engineer, so have some basis for judgment). I certainly wouldn't buy another one, and have not yet been able to find a source for replacement parts."
1,Royal flush,"Unfortunately, I have one of these crosscut shredders. I've used it no more than ten times. I keep it plugged in but I hadn't used it for maybe a month. When I went to use it, kaputsky. Absolutely will not work now; overload light is on (nothing is wrong with the unit, however, the cutters turn freely in reverse). There is a safety interlock switch that prevents the unit from being turned on with the wastebasket removed (so you can't turn it on). HOWEVER, this saftety interlock has failed (NOT safe, it failed allowing the unit to be turned on with the basket removed)and thus, technically, your child could put his fingers into the cutters from below, start the shredder in reverse, and afterwards he could no longer count to ten.All of these Royal units have bad reviews. I wish that I had looked at them before I purchased this item. Had I, I wouldn't have."
2,A Good Representation of Singapore Gay Scene,"Among the three books which represent gay men in Singapore--the other being Johann Lee's Peculiar Chris and Edmund Wee's The Narcissist--this is the best one of all. It is less pretentious then The Narcissist and less vindicative than Peculiar Chris.However, my gripe with it is that it's too simplistic (although realistic) a story and that sometimes it reads like a thesauras: out of nowhere, a bombastic, incongruous word would pop up as if to prove a point about the extent of the writer's vocab."
4,Cultural history from Playboy to Phyllis Schafly,"Barbara Ehrenreich was a prominent feminist author, who'd written books chronicling the way the culture has mistreated women, likeFor Her Own Good: Two Centuries of the Experts Advice to Women(with Deirdre English). But then she got interested in the notion that the culture was also mistreating men. At first, she says, she was skeptical. She intended to write a book mocking the idea. But the more she researched it, the more she realized the men had a point: patriarchy hurts them too.The result is a book that's not only a brilliant chronicle of how the sexual revolution has changed men's lives, but an honest attempt to grapple with what it all means for women. It's a fascinating read -- her reinterpretation of Playboy alone is worth the work."
2,Two stars is overly generous,"I thought that this book was well researched. That is why I was generous enough to give it two stars. However, the dryness of this novel cannot be described. This book dragged on for hours and at the end it was hard to make a point out of the book as a whole. I got as much out of the first page as I did from the middle 200. I do not recommend this book to anyone who expects a book that will not only flow well, but will also keep the reader even remotely interested."
3,Some of these songs are incomplete,"This is an obviously bootlegged CD of the early work of the Sugar Hill Gang and Gradmaster Flash from the earliest days of rap. Much of this is not available elsewhere on CD, so that's a plus. In fact, some of these tunes (Rapper's Reprise, Sugar Hill Groove, and Passion Play) are from the 1980 Sugar Hill Gang album, which has never been released on CD in its entirety. The very rare track ""The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel"" (c. 1981) which is acknowledged as the first public recording of a DJ mix. Many of the better tunes here, however, are not in complete form."
3,I could have been happier with this product,"I purchased two of these vests for my dogs so that they would be seen in the snow as something other than a hunted animal. First off, I found them to run a bit small. My male, Herman Munster, has a very large chest, and the strap barely fit around it. The back strap also has a fit issue. If I were to close it, it would come right across his penis. Not a great feature. So I had to snap it together on his back, so it just kind of flaps around like a cape. The first time he wore it, the strap got caught on a branch, and totally unraveled. So even if the placement had worked, it's of no use to me now. My female, Lily Munster, is on the chubby side, and the straps barely fit around her. I couldn't go up a size, because it would be too long for her body. So all in all, I'm not impressed with them. Sizing was an issue, placement of straps, durability also did not impress me. The concept is great, but I could've been more impressed."
4,Great for hiking dogs in hunting season.,"I bought this vest for my dog last fall because we hike a lot, and I didn't want her to be mistaken for a bear or some other critter during hunting season. I followed the sizing chart and bought her the X-Large. It's still a little too big for her, but by folding the back under, it works great.I have to say, this vest makes me worry a lot less about loosing sight of her, or about other people not seeing her. She shook herself a bit at first when I first put it on, but once we were outside and there were other things to distract her, the vest didn't bother her at all. Now when we put it on, she acts like it's not even there. She will occasionally get caught on branches, but I make sure it's as snug as i can get it, and generally we haven't had too many problems.I've thrown this in the washer and lined dried it as well, and it's still bright and together.I highly recommend this for dogs who walk unfettered during hunting season."
3,Big and awkward,"I read the specs on this and had to order an XXL for my 3 yr old Chow/Retriever who weighs 93 lbs. I ordered the XXL because his chest is 36"" the vest fit him perfectly around his girth, but was way to long (the vest was 30"" long and my dog is only 25"" long from neck to tail) and of course that made the back strap in the way for my dog to use the bathroom. I ended up altering the vest, shortening the length and cutting off the back straps all together. The vest now fits him perfectly, so if you have an irregular dog (short and big like mine) this probably wont fit without some alterations"
5,"It's an orange dog vest, what else do you want?",We live in the middle of the woods and this is great so I can take my dogs for a walk and I can see them and so can any hunters. If fit fine and was easily adjustable.
3,Too tight,Although I followed directions on measuring & ordered accordinglyIt is too tight for our golden retriever & not a lot of adjustingCan be done. Should have been a size larger which was not offered.
3,"Average, would prefer more chest material","The vest is fine, but there isn't much of the orange reflector material on the chest of the dog, when walking at night and cars coming toward you (the safer way to walk at night so you can see the oncoming traffic too) - it is hard for the cars to see the dog.otherwise, material is fine."
4,Good product but fits female better than male dog.,The vest is just as shown in the picture and the length is right but the last strap that goes under the dog's belly hit's the male's penis! I just don't strap it under his belly. I fold it under the top of the vest. It's not as stable that way but I don't know what else to do. Not the greatest design for male dogs. Female's is perfect however.
1,Poorly designed,"Wishing I had read the reviews thoroughly before buying this vest. My dog was uncomfortable wearing it, and I was unable to buckle the rear because it fell right at his back legs. (the closest point for buckling was across his male parts) He spent the only time he wore it trying to chew & rip it off. I have since bought a different kind, and he prances around the yard without paying any attention to the new one. The price is enticing, but look elsewhere if you own a lab!"
5,Wonderful Piece of Technology,"I'm currently listening to my headphone as I'm reviewing this.I'll base my review on three factors:Sound: The sound quality is awesome. The sound is very crisp and has a good amount of bass. For added bass, the M.D.S.E feature improves sound quality - however, I don't think you'll ever be needing this unless you're going deaf.Portability: Headphone is very portable - lightweight and compact. It also fits perfectly to your ears and holds in place. Quite comfortable I might add.PC Compartability: The included software is very simple and easy to use. Ever burnt a CD? Then you can handle this.Overall, if you are looking for something simple and stylish to listen to music with, this is your best bet. It might not store a million songs but it's well worth it especially for the average listener."
2,A real C-,"Doesn't actually play MP3s, but a propriety format converted during transfer. Every computer needs their special software. Headphones themselves are floppy and are easily displaced by even modest activity."
2,Not to easy to follow,I thought the book is good but not too easy to follow. THe book is a self shiatzu technique and if you are trying to know more about the technique this is not the book for you
2,Moreso a Collector's Item,"This is more of a collector's item than something you will like listening to, because it is over so fast. Unless you love live tracks, then this is for you. This is just a radio promo disk sent out to radio stations for new tracks to play. The #2 ADIDAS single is far better with remixes that you can listen to."
5,Just as expected,"Very pretty, made a good gift. The pearls were hand knotted which is unusual in a less expensive necklace. Very pleased."
1,Horrible Excuse for Noise Rock,"My friends and I saw Smoke and Smoke open up for Minus the Bear in 2004. By the end of their set, we had decided, unanimously, that they were the worst band, of any genre, that we had ever seen or heard.Judging from the sounds on this album, their atrocious sounds and laughable lyrics seem to have remained relatively unchanged.This isn't ""good"" bad, like Primus. This is just pure bad, through and through."
1,Drivel.,"Now I'm not Christian, nor have I ever been. I was raised in a Catholic household and fortunately I saw the fact that there was no need to believe in silly things such as god. I believe there is a higher power but whatever it is it isn't like the Christian god. I don't know if gays are born with their preference or something in their upbringing causes them to be gay, but either way, if someone is happy, let them be happy, don't fix what isn't broken, let them be gay.This book is for gay-hating, conservative christians, to read so they can say, ""Yeah see. It is wrong and can be cured. I knew it (in my closed mind) all along."" Or gays that were never really gay, gays who are gay just becasue they are confused and lonely and got drawn into gay culture, kinda like John.But for people who know they are gay, (and gay for whatever reason or because of whatever) they don't need this crap."
1,OOOOOOOO-KKKKKKKKKKK !,"I wish I could rate this book with negative stars for its sheer absurdity. This book is unbelievably disturbing. Homosexuality isn't some weird cult that you just walk in and out of!!! It's not some disease that has to be cured!!! Do people REALLY think like this!?!? GIMME A BREAK!!! This is by far one of the most ridiculous books ever published on the face of the earth. Knowing that people think like this will make you look forward to death. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go..."
1,Sheer Hypocrisy,"John Paulk is not afraid to change his homosexuality. He is just plain unable to, as evidenced by his September 2000 visit to a gay bar in Washington, D.C. The ex-gay movement is in need of a spokesman who practices what he preaches."
4,Not Afraid to Change : The Remarkable Story of How One Man,"This is a book that truly reveals how one man struggled for years to overcome a lifestyle that overpowered his life. John Paulk literally put himself on the line to share with people his overwhelming life change. It is a book for Christians and non-Christians alike, as it is not too preachy and doesn't reference scripture non-stop as many other books of this type tend to do. I applaud Mr. Paulk for his willingness to explore such a controversial subject, take the criticism, and tell his life story for those who need to know that they can change. As for Mr. Paulk's ""Washington, D.C."" incident: don't judge. No one really knows his motives - it may have been curiosity; a peak at his past lifestyle."
4,inkjet,"I haven't had any issues except that my printer doesn't want to work, besides that the inkjet works fine prior experience they have last a long time, easy to use."
2,This is Really Cheap and Crappy,"Th9is is not a very good product. The description is misleading. There is NO heat involved here. You have to put hot water in it and it ""claims"" to ""keep the water warm"" which it does not. The infrared is useless. It does give a nice massage, but the attachments are also cheap and cheesy. If yo want a decent foot spa go with the Brookstone model. This is not worth the money."
1,waste of 100.00,"I've owned this spa for less than 2 months, and it quit working all I can think of is motor burned out and I did not use it for 20 minutes or longer.....I wish I had never ever purchased it,,,,,,,,,It is a total rip off. Does not heat water as stated"
5,Your computer will love you for it.,Get rid of yo ballz!Yep this mouse has no balls!But it still has plenty to show!SMOOTH!DOES NOT GET DIRTY!CAN BE PROGRAMMED!
5,Great mouse! You can't go wrong with this!,"Wow! This is nice! Works great! Great price!No more sticky mouse balls to deal with. You don't even need a mouse pad. Easy to use. Just plug it in, turn your computer on, and you're in business. Comes with software, but I've seen no reason to install that.I highly recommend this mouse."
1,bought this for the great reviews -- but it's horrible!,"Don't know if I have a defective mouse or what, but this mouse lags in a big way. Whenever the mouse runs over items that cause the cursor to change, it stalls. It's the worst when you try to move it slowly on top of something. Sometimes the cursor doesn't budge. And I thought my track ball mouse was a pain! After a week of use, this one is giving me tendonitis in my elbow! I thought perhaps I just need to get used to using an optical mouse, but it's not worth it. I'm trashing this one and going back to my track ball. Or do those higher priced optical mice really perform better than the cheap ones? I'm hesitant to try them since there were such good reviews on this mouse, and it's obviously not working for me..."
2,2-button mouse kludged to act as 3-button mouse,"Take a close look at the picture before ordering this--it's only got two real buttons. The scroll wheel is used as the middle button, which is quite awkward."
3,"Not great, but good","I'm currently using this mouse for my laptop computer and while it is certainly an upgrade from the touchpad this mouse isn't as great as some of the other reviews have made it out to be. Not to belittle the product, it is a good mouse, but it isn't fantastic. The scroll wheel is a little rough and not quite as smooth as some mice I've used and I've just purchased this product so I can't comment on its durability. So, overall, you might want to chip in the few extra bucks for an upgraded mouse. As the title of this review states--not great, but good."
5,Keeps on going,I have had this for over 3 years now. Even dropped it at least a few times - but it just keeps on going. I am getting tired of it - but it does not get tired.Dont think twice - just go for it.
5,I'm so Ashamed,"Yes...I feel so..dumb. How long have I gone with a ""ball"" mouse that had to be cleaned periodically? Don't ask. It was just something I put up with as it never seemed to be a priority. But I finally broke down after a recent ""ball cleaning"" and ordered the Logitech optical mouse.Once it arrived, it took only 5 minutes to set up, and then I was clicking away like a mad-person. I swear, it seems as though my internet connection is faster, but of course it's just the ease at which I can now move thru pages, etc.So if you're out there now reading this and you've yet to ""go optical,"" stop with the excuses and take a few minutes to purchase this mouse. You'll thank me later :)"
5,"The best, no frills optical mouse","If you're looking for a basic, no frills optical mouse that has a wheel, go with the Logitech Optical Mouse.This mouse is a standard at my workplace, because:- The price is close to a non-optical mouse with similar features- Processes more images per second than the competition, so it's ideal for games too (other first gen optical mice lose accuracy when you move the mouse really fast and end up moving the mouse pointer in a random direction)- Easy setup. Just plug and play.- Very durable, stood up to constant abuse we give it.And for the other reviewers than mention this, please don't knock this mouse because it doesn't work as well on a shiny surface. Optical mice (including this one and all the others) are not designed to work on a shiny surface, so go get yourself one of the millions of mousepads in existance that does not have this property."
4,Excellent value for money,"Delivers a lot for 10 bucks. After having worked with a ball-mouse for so long, it is definitely a step-up. excellent value for money."
5,Logitech Optical Mouse,"Functions well despite constant use. Great price, lasts longer than Microsoft product."
4,Worked well for the price,"This was my first optical mouse when switching from a ball mouse, it changed my life, I was like:""wow, how did I ever use that old thing?"". I bought it for $12 and it has lasted about a year now, but it's going out on me, when you don't move for a few seconds and the sensor auto turns off, it now takes a few seconds for it to come back on, which is deadly when gaming, I'm replacing it with another logitech, an mx518."
3,"Does the job, But is bad quality","I had purchased this book for a class I took about Jazz. We played songs from it. Overall, our instructor appreciated the book. Nevertheless, he did notice that many of the students had books in terrible condition. This is a result of the poor quality of the construction of the book. The front and back cover are nothing more than thick pieces of paper that will easily get dirty and bend. After a years worth of mild use, you can expect the covers to appear completely bent or torn off the binding. Furthermore, the binding is constructed with cheap plastic and will bend upon shipment. This makes it difficult to keep the book open or closed.Overall, the content of the book is acceptable but the quality of the binding and covers is not."
5,"Real Book, Real Great",This book is a must have for any Jazz musician. Songs like Anthropology and Cheroke are among the greats you'll find in here.
2,Older Version Better,"Bought this as a replacement for one purchased over 20 years ago, when you had to ""know someone"". First 5 minutes flipping through the book, right away stopped 3 errors that weren't in my old version. Disappointing. Make sure you have a good teacher to help you correct these."
3,Start with Volume II,"This book does have God Bless the Child, but not as good as either Volume II and III. I have all three and use them when I want to jam on a standard on the sax."
3,Cute but erroneous,As a Peace Corps volunteer I have to say that in my entire two years I have not done anything to fight terrorism nor is that our mission. In reality volunteers are not sent to areas where their contributions to the community might have a direct impact on the people who commit acts of terror. If we do have any link to fighting these pathetic monsters it is a very distant one.
1,Do your homework before sticking this on your car.,"Peace Corps volunteers provide aid to developing countries. Mostly, they are a corps of college grads with education and skills to share, but not usually any sort of military or intelligence training. Those skills belong to the armed forces, obviously.What are we going to do? Get rid of our military and simply send everybody to help out third world countries? Because, I assure you, sending our MOSTLY non-muslum citizens over to a Muslum country (no, this is not an attack on Muslums) where extremist Muslum terrorist organizations operate ... to try and ""volunteer"" and institute health, education, and environmental programs is NOT the way to fight terrorism. They are not going to say, ""Oh, thank you! You guys really aren't so bad after all."""
2,"Good product, bad size.","The ink is great, but these color cartridges only last through a couple dozen prints! I find that I need to replace them almost weekly with my regular printing habits."
4,good service,Arrived quickly & as described. I had suspected that it was outdated & was in original plastic package but not in original box. I had bought one before & ink was ok at that time.
5,epson inkjet cartridge (olor),"Me gusto el precio, el mejor que he conseguido. La calidad del producto muy buena, el envio muy rapido lo recomiendo"
4,Original Manufacturer,"It's tough to find outdated cartridges for your printer(that still works fine) much less get them in a timely manner. Amazon does for inventory what Google has done for information: puts what you want, where you want it, when you want it. I like bricks and mortar but this cannot be beat."
4,"Great ink, decent value","With the Epson Photo 870 printer and Epson papers this color ink cartridge produces excellent results. The colors are extremely accurate and the cartridge itself is basically foolproof. Seems to run out quickly (about twice as fast as the black cartridge), but so far I haven't been even slightly tempted to try a generic alternative."
2,"good price, mediocre product","I bought this t.v. for the price and screen size, and it started out as a good deal. After a short time, I started getting a very large green and purple spot on the screen whenever bright things were shown on the t.v. I took it back and got another of the same model and had the same problem again. After over a year, the problem has not improved despite changes in location and the media that I play on it."
4,Smooth and evolved Greek Black Metal,"Rotting Christ has evolved into one Helluva solid Black Metal act. After many albums and many more lineup changes Rotting Christ has worked their way into the pantheon of such greats as Satyricon, Emperor and DarkThrone. All the while forging a sound unique to the Greek underground. This album is not as raw as Rotting Christ's older works, nor does it have the slower, more gothic overtones of the records that came immediately before it. Sanctus Diavolos is more of a fusion and maturing of Rotting Christ's old and new sounds. Highly recommended."
2,What happened?,"In the past you could always count on Rotting Christ to come up with reliable yet unremarkable black/death metal albums. Sanctus Diavolos starts out with a bang. 'Visions of a Blind Disorder' is one of the greatest songs ever recorded: a triumphant brutal, complex, dark, wicked- yes even- evil symphony with gorgeous melodies reminiscent of Dissection. Unfortunately, the rest of the album however falls flat in comparison with that masterpiece- slow, tedious, and somewhat lame. Had RC kept on with that style of song this album could have been great. The rest of the songs seem to have been composed and performed by someone else- that's how different and disappointing they are. As it stands, it is not easy to recommend an entire album for one spectacular song."
2,Shipping cost is outrageous beware,"This item costs $1.10 for the purchase price, the slowest shipping method costs over $9.00."
4,"Nice image, a little grainy","The subject of the picture is great, and I like that it looks like a real window with a crooked blind..but the image is so grainy that it doesn't give the illusion of a real scene...maybe it isn't supposed to, but that is what I was looking for. Still an interesting piece and a very nice poster..."
1,Sorry I bought it!,This shredder worked really well for about 2 weeks and then only worked if I banged on the basket and otherwise jiggled it. Now it rarely works at all. I'm giving up on it and tossing it.
1,Junk,Stopped working after 2 weeks. Had it worked on and it then stopped working 3 weeks after that. Ended up in the dumpster.
5,Pleasantly Surprised,"A paper shredder is not really and exciting purchase however, I am very pleased with this one. The ability to have two methods to shred is quite smart. I would recommend this model for the home or small businesses. The bin for the shreds is quite large and convenient to remove for emptying. This was a feature that should be stress more in the verbiage describing this unit. It is a little bit loud however; it is a shredder. Put this model next to your desk to keep your privacy in your control."
1,Broke on me after 1 year,"This shredder was nothing but a pain. The thing broke on me after about 1 year. Not sure what I'm supposed to do w/ the non-working, clunky thing now."
3,Helpful enough to pass,"If you've got a little background, then this book reinforces your knowledge, and then some. But don't count on acing the test if you're tapping into this subject for the first time. Allow yourself a week to go through the book bit by bit. It can be overwhelming if you choose to cram. And like everything else, get a good night sleep the night prior to your test, and you'll do much better for sure."
1,Outdated Info - Hard To Follow,"This book includes a number of random multiple choice questions. In fact, that is all it includes. There is no feedback as to why 'answer A' is the correct choice. The information is outdated and uses obsolete wording. Took the test, passed with flying colors but it wasn't because of this book! Learned more from one of the CLEP recommended websites than the questions included in the text. If Amazon had a Zero Star rating, this book would get it from me."
2,Not worth it!,"I ordered this book with a lot of expectations, which were not fulfilled. It is very skimpy and just gives a few ""example"" charts and predicts for them. Basically, the book is interesting but not detailed enough. I wanted descriptions of each progressed planet to each natal planet, not wanting just to see a few token examples and having to understand from them, what others might be. I WON'T be getting any other Celeste Teal books ever again."
1,TERRIBLE,"This book was a complete waste of my time and money. I do not recommend this to ANYONE who wants an astrology book... unless you are already equipped with the ""right"" software. It gives you little to no explanation on how to get your natal chart let alone your progressed chart! If you want to look at others meaningless charts, just in case yours miiiiight look like one, then this is the book for you! It does have ALOTTTT of other peoples examples and what not. But good luck finding your own info. I just was looking for a more informative book. This did NOT NOT NOT fit that bill."
4,So far I appreciate it.,"I bought the Kindle edition but there's always the internet problem , so I have it shipped to me.Overall ,they provide details quite understanable but I think when they make the example of the personal chart , it just pop - up right there in the middle of the paragraph ,which I don't like because sometimes make me confuse to read."
4,It is what I thought it would be,"It is what I thought it would be. Average cost, average shipping. The product works great for the basement. Looks much better after product was put down. Would recommend to anyone instead of just cement paint. The epoxy is the way to go."
5,"Rust-Oleum 203007 Basement Floor Kit, Gray","Make my garrage floor more pretty, Awsome, and good price, My uncle came to my house asking how and what do you do on your floor, so I recommende him to do that, thanks for product"
4,My boys love it,Another great video game.My boys are 6 and 8 and they watch the show on tv and now they play the game!If your kids like Avatar they should love this game.Keeps them busy for hours!
3,Avatar: Mixed Review...,"This game is fun, but it's definitely not for anyone that's a hardcore gamer. I like playing it, but it's just not very in-depth. I'm entertained pretty easily with games, so I don't mind. But if you want an action packed, deep story, this game is definitely not for you. I call this a ""rainy day"" game."
1,"This game is fun... but DON""T GET IT!!","This game is lots of fun, even if you have never heard of the avatar, but don't get this game!! It is very short, too easy, and will take 8 hours tops to complete the game. The main story line is fun, but the quests are so boring. So, don't waist your money on this game! it is a rip-off!!!"
4,the importance of the past to the present,"Gillespie explores Trifonov's attempts to explain the present in terms of the past. As a fan of Trifonov, I was curious as to what Gillespie was attempting to do. I was not disappointed. He is systematic in his approach, establishing trends and isolating the major preoccupations that are constant in all the author's works. Gillespie also highlights when Trifonov is entering into dialogue with other authors. He offers some valuable insights and sets the reader thinking."
4,Great Mouse,"Buttons are a little hard to click for my taste, but most wireless are.That is my only complained I love this mouse!"
3,Jumpy Mouse,"Just about every 5 mouse click it jumps about 1"" up on the screen. Usually, this just slows me down, but sometimes it jumps on another active link and off we go to someplace we don't want to go."
2,almost there,"sadly this mouse with all its great features does annoy the heck out of you when it jumps all over the screen, all other functions are great it controls most media players which is why i wanted it but , grrrrrr its as bad as my old mouse i needed to replace which would have a clicking attack lol id click once it would click 2 or 3 times closing pages on me, i am not very pleased and eventually will be buying a new one, id return it if the remote control function wasnt so neat...also the software that comes with it searches ONLY in the drive that it is on, plus it will say it found music yet it wont play it, it acts like its a zero file it does look real nice though buy at your own risk i did"
1,asesop fables pockets,I got in the mail very quickly and the it looked very neat and i went through the pages and realized i can use it for my first graders with the new common core curriculum so thanks
3,Avatar fan,My son is a Avatar fan. He is 7y/o. Some of the levels were a little too hard for him and his college brother helped him. They both liked it and had fun with it.
4,Good tutorial-style indepth coverage of XSL,Contrary to one of the other reviews on this site I found this to be an excellent structured approach to learning XSL. The book however is not a reference guide as much as a step by step tutorial. Read cover to cover the reader should gain a good indepth knowledge on the subject. The content is light enough to keep you interested but not so light that you're left guessing and the later chapters (while not necessary to gaining good XSL knowledge) cover a lot of advanced topics such as XSL-FO.PS. No where on the back cover or in the contents are topics such as JAVA or CGI mentioned. The reviewer who expressed dismay at lack of coverage in these areas should have bought a different book if that's what they wanted to start off with.
3,Super Reader,"This is the book Conan the Avenger was retitled as later on.Conan, an established king in Aquilonia gets married. His queen, Zenobia, is kidnapped by a wizard's sorcerous beast.Asking a local sorcerer for assistance, he sets out to track her down, and retraces the paths of a few of his old exploits in the process. Piracy with the brotherhood, disposing of some Turanians, again rescuing the Devi, and more. Not much chat her, lots of sword."
1,"God's Word, Final, Infallible and Forever","I was not very inpressed. No serious attempt at scholarship was made here. This book was not even a good run-of-the-mill anti-mormon book. This is the type of book that makes you wish you could get a refund in time. For example, his story in the beginning of the book about his introduction to mormonism struck my BS meter with thunderous effect.There is a difference between a good doctrinal debate about the differences of mormon doctrine and the rest of Christiandom (and there are quite a few) and a not-so-effective smear campaign. This book makes no good contribution to the debate. For anyone looking for a good read, look elsewhere"
3,Caution - doesn't fit every baby properly,"I purchased this wrap when my son was 1 month old. He was well within weight limits, but he was already ""busting at the seams"" so to speak when I closed it around his arms. I also noticed that my little Houdini was somehow able to wriggle around in the wrap and get the front up around his face while he was sleeping. I was a little concerned about his ability to breathe, but more troublesome was the irritation factor that woke him up.Because he was already able to get the small opening up around his face, I decided not to buy the larger size to see if it would work for him. I LOVE the concept, but I highly recommend trying the wrap for naptime to see how it fits your baby."
4,good for the first few weeks,"This was very helpful for the first few weeks, especially since I did not know how to wrap the blanket. Once I started getting the hang of motherhood, I no longer needed it. My baby was also not fussy and didn't seem to have any particular preference to being swaddled."
3,"Good concept, imperfect execution","The SwaddleMe wrap is a really smart concept, almost a touch of genius, unfortunately the wrap itself is not well made and feels very cheap. (BTW, the fleece is for cold days and get the cotton knit for warm days, otherwise you baby's gonna overheat.) I guess to sell it for $9.99, they have to cut corners, and where they cut would have mattered a lot: fabric quality and durability, ease of use, longevity of the velcro tabs. After a couple wash cycles the thing feels even flimsier. I really applaud the design but abhor the actual implementation. I'd gladly pay $20 for one if they made the quality much better."
1,"Velcro doesn't work, legs too loose","I bought this thinking that it was the answer to my swaddling prayers. When I brought my 8 pound newborn home, I wrapped her in it right away. She wanted her hands out, which was no big deal. But then I noticed that she kept waking up because there is too much leg room and she was kicking herself awake. There is no way to wrap the legs tighter. I decided to swaddle her the old fashion way in a flannel blanket then wrap her with this on cold nights. The second night I used this blanket, the velcro stopped sticking. What a waste of money."
1,Just use a baby blanket,"I bought this before my baby was born. I tried to use the swaddle me blanket but it was thin, felt cheap and the big velcro kept get stuck and made it bunchy. My baby was a nine pound baby but he still didn't fit as well in the Swaddle me as he did in the baby blankets that we were given. We had to swaddle him to get him to sleep, but he did not like the Swaddle me, it didn't work for us and it was a waste of money for us."
1,"Good Idea, but...","My baby will NOT stay wrapped up in this! Even when she was just a few days old, she was strong enough to wiggle out. And while velcro seems like a good idea, once she gets it loose, it could scratch her.The Magic Blanket is a much better product, and I can even do a better job swaddling traditionally, with a large, lightweight blanket."
1,VERY DANGEROUS! My baby almost SMOTHERED! Pls read!,"Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this blanket. The velcro that is supposed to keep the blanket closed is very dangerous. Because it does not allow the blanket to loosen, it stays shut if your baby tries to wriggle out of it. My baby girl tried to wriggle out of this blanket, and because of the velcro closure, it stayed shut, but the blanket moved up over her entire face. She would have smothered if I had not caught her in time. PLEASE please do not use this- check out other blankets (such as the Miracle Blanket, for example) that do not have velcro to keep them shut. This way if they try to wriggle out of it, the blanket will loosen up and not stay shut. There are others on the market- just make sure not to get any with the velcro or other closures that prevent the blanket from loosening. I bought mine on eBay because they are more expensive to pay full retail, but no price at all is worth having a terrible tragedy that is preventable."
5,Keep baby's arms -straight at their sides- when swaddling.,"I was nervous about proper swaddling but amazed at how quickly I became a pro, even with an oversized infant blanket! I also recommend Beyond Baby Basics blankets, check them out online, they are bigger than the usual little blankets out there and work awesome for swaddling.The trick is to keep baby's arms straight at their sides (not crossed at chest). It sounds like this is torturous but actually baby prefers it and it is much harder to escape, otherwise the blanket or swaddler will creep up towards neck and face. Happiest Baby on the Block DVD is essential when learning about baby's swaddling needs and how to do it correctly."
2,Not worth it!,"I don't think every newborn likes to be swaddled. My newborn did not like being swaddle, he liked his hands to be free. I received this as a shower gift and tried using it the first few days when he came home, but he really didn't like feeling constrained. I really would not register for this product again. Most newborn outgrow swaddling that in my opinion it is not worth buying this product in the long run."
5,VERY HELPFUL!,"The SwaddleMe Wrap made such a difference to us. We have a very active sleeper who would always get out of his blanket and end up hitting himself in the face with his arms when he was asleep, waking himself up often. Then someone told us about the SwaddleMe wrap. Once we used it, our son slept so soundly. These truly made SUCH a difference to us and our son's ability to sleep soundly and happily. I love them!"
4,Mother of Twins,"My husband and I love the SwaddleMe blanket. Our girls will be 6 months old in a week and still loved to be swaddled. We have found the large size. It is great. We don't swaddle their arms anymore, just around their tummies. Since we moved to the large size a week ago, they have slept for 8-10 hours a night.I too wish the velcro was stonger. Thank goodness they make the larger size."
3,Good but maybe short-lived solution,"I loved the SwaddleMe blanket for the first few weeks. It's very simple and quick to use, and is cozy. However, at about 4 weeks old, my very active and often fussy baby was able to break out of it. He was gaining his strength just as the SwaddleMe's velcro was showing wear. I splurged on the Amazing Miracle Blanket (2.5-3 times as expensive as SwaddleMe) and it's worked much better.If your baby is not particularly active/strong but likes a tight swaddle, the SwaddleMe blanket might be just the ticket. At $10 it may be worth a shot - and hopefully you will at least get a few weeks of good use (and sleep) out of it!"
3,nice idea but doesn't work,"I think the idea is great, but it didn't work with my son.He is too strong for this and was able to get out of the swaddle me practically from birth. Miracle blanket works much better"
2,doesn't last long,"The wrap works ok for a short while, but then my son - the escape artist - was popping out. The velcro pulled off too easily (from the wash), and the pulling at the velcro - when he started to outgrow it - either startled him or woke him up. There just isn't enough fabric for it to be practical.This is a cheap imitation of the Miracle Blanket. Don't waste your money on something that doesn't last much longer than a swaddling blanket does. [...] Yup, its expensive, but my little guy was sleeping soundly and thru the night at 2 months with the real thing - and they were big enough to last him until 5 months old, when he weaned himself from it."
3,A step up frm a receiving blanket but out classed,"We received this plus theLoving Baby Swaddle Blanket, ""The Perfect Swaddle!"", Mellow Yellow Mintas shower gifts. The Swaddle me is a step up from a receiving blanket, but the Loving Baby is two steps up from there. We have not tried theMiracle Blanket - Baby Swaddling Blanket - Beigeyet -- some say that is the best of the field. But the Loving Baby is so good (not to mention cheaper then the Miracle blanket) that I have to vote for it as the winner.Note: there seems to be a difference of opinions on how long to leave a baby swaddled. The hospital left our newborn daughter swaddled overnight (in a receiving blanket that worked very well when done right). But the Sears bookThe Baby Book: Everything You Need to Know About Your Baby from Birth to Age Two (Revised and Updated Edition)warns that swaddling should be limited. We are swaddling for afternoon nap not overnight and it works beautifully for keeping her calm."
5,Love it!,"for the 1st 6 mo, my daughter had to be swaddled to sleep. This product kept her snug and was quick and easy to use."
5,SLEEEEEP BABY SLEEEEEP!,"The Swaddleme is sleep magic! My newborn son was born early and feels comfort being held or swaddled. He is able to push and kick away a regular blanket swaddle, so I thought I'd give this a try. It is a Godsend! He sleeps so soundly. The microfleece is the softest, it's like he's sleeping in a cloud. He looks so content and peaceful all cuddled up. The velcro is in just the right place for a nice snug fit. I am buying this as a gift for all my friends having babies."
4,Good item to have,"I like this swaddler blanket, I would definitely buy it again. It helps when I didn't know how to swaddle my daughter and its very warm. She slept just as well int that as she did in a normal blanket that I swaddled her in.I have 2 complaints though. My first is that the velcro patches, while they would stick about half the time, they would slip the rest and she could squirm out of it pretty quick if you didn't secure it just right. The other is that if you DO secure it just right (as shown in the pictures), the fabric covered up her mouth and I would have to fold the fabric down which, as a new mom, made me paranoid it was going to flip back up and smother her. It never did, but you still worry. I just used a little safety pin and secured it down. Other than that, it was a great investment and helped her to sleep better at night."
5,Get a few of these!!,"I LOVE these wraps, I wish I had them for my 1'st 3 kids, it's so easy to swaddle them anyone can do it!I took mine to the hospital and used it instead of swaddling them in receiving blankets, The fleece is greatfor chilly nights and winter, you know baby will be nice and warm the material is really soft and the Velcro holds well.Great baby gift for a shower also! A+++"
4,Simple Swaddle Solution,"I like the simplicity of the swaddle- even my husband could figure it out. A contour in the neck would be a good alteration- I do not like how high it goes in my babies face. Not high enough to interfere with breathing, but high enough for a worried new mom to constantly 'have' to check it! My baby could wiggle his way out by week two; still I was happy to have the swaddle since he did like being in it & it made the first two weeks easier."
3,The small size is to small,"I really like the idea and maybe it would have been better if I had gotten the bigger size. Anyway by the time my baby was 2 months old he was already to big for this. He weighted only 10 lbs, I just expected it to last longer. My only advice is unless you have a very tiny baby like less then 6 lbs when they are born just get the bigger size. I was great when it did fit kept him warm and was easy to put on."
4,nice product,This product is like swaddling for dummies! It is great for those who have problems swaddling babies with a traditional blanket. It makes it very easy to calm a screaming baby!
5,I love it and baby loves it,"I wish I had bought one sooner. It was amazing how much better baby slept with this. Also, I didn't worry about it coming loose and smothering her like a regular blanket might. I also love the two parts - the top I would undo when she was eating and the bottom for changing."
3,First 2 weeks,"The SwaddleMe came in handy for my son's first 2 weeks at home. It was easy to swaddle and adjust him in it. Changing his diaper was difficult at first (I didn't want to get it dirty.) It was easier to take him out of it. The SwaddleMe did keep him nice and cozy. Unfortunately, he liked his freedom and that was the end of swaddling. For what it's worth, I'd swaddle with the receiving blankets (you'll have plenty of those on hand.)"
4,Item is Great,"This item is great, but the baby can grow out of it pretty quick. It's a great alternative to the blanket swaddling way."
4,Wonderful,This is great for the first 3 months maybe 4. After that they move around so much and break free from anything.
3,Nice though not exactly practical,I loved the idea behind this but you really only want to use this when they are small and the size small was still to big for my son to be swaddled tightly enough to create the comfort he needed. He was 7lb6oz (which isn't even that small). They should really make a preemie size or make the small a little smaller.
2,"Great for shorter, quieter babies","These have a great idea, but if your child is a kicker (like mine) they will quickly have their legs loose and will not enjoy this product. My daughter loves being swaddled, but these do not keep the child's legs tight enough! Also if your child is over 20'', they will be too long for the small size."
1,Why bother????,"I registered for this, received it as a shower gift, and found it to be very difficult to use. It seemed like it would make swaddling easier, but it didn't. It was easier to figure out how to do a tight burrito wrap with a regular blanket after the nurses in the hospital showed me how -- and my baby preferred that."
1,"Great concept, but not very practical.","This item has a great concept, but really does not work. It could not contain my daughter. She could wiggle out of this very easily. Would not recommend this item."
2,"Great In Theory, Not So Great In Reality","This seemed like such a great idea that we registered for 2 of them. When Luna actually came along she the blanket didn't work so well. She somehow managed to sneak her arms out every time we tried to use it. Also, it seemed to ride up above her shoulders and get in her face. A plain old recieving blanket worked much better if you know how to wrap your baby properly."
2,Did not work for my son,"Because my daughter liked to be swaddled when she was a baby, I thought I would buy this product for my son. It did not work, possibly because of his size. He was 22 1/2 inches, 8 pounds 10 ounces at birth. It was hard to get him into the blanket, and he always got an arm free. However, it is probably not too expensive to at least try it for your baby."
2,Thought it would be great but it didn't swaddle him tight,Maybe our baby was too small but it didn't seem like I was able to get this product tight enough on our newborn. The Carter's waffle blankets worked better for us and are a better value because they can be used for other purposes as well. After reading all the positive reviews I'm going to try this again so may update my review again now that he's bigger.
5,Great for getting baby's to sleep!!!,"I wish I had found this sooner. I did not get it until my son was almost 2 months old. After I read The Happy Baby By Harvey Karp (GREAT BOOK!!!), I ordered this. It helped keep my son swaddled and I did not have to worry about loose blankets. With my next child, I will definitely have these for when we come home from the hospital"
5,Cute,"I purchased this as a gift for a family member for their babyshower. It was her request, so we'll see if she loves it. I'm sure she will."
3,Too small,I know this was for infants I have a few others but this one was way to small for my 8lb baby.
2,Not impressed..... at first,"I purchased this for my 8 week old son who is 10 pounds and growing longer everyday. I saw the good reviews and was so excited to get it. Well...Pros: Soft, warm, and cute.Cons: A little too big, (he can break free EASILY), I've found my son with it over his mouth and nose numerous times, not good!! The baby is able to wiggle down despite it being velcro and TIGHT.I would just use a large flannel blanket or something else, this isn't worth the money.UPDATE: Unfortunately, I cannot change the star review or I'd bump it up to 4 stars +. I gave this product more time and sure enough, my baby is addicted. I don't know truly if it has to do with the swaddler but he is swaddled and sleeping soundly each night. What a dream come true. He likes to free his hands at night but the blanket keeps him covered and warm and it kind of hugs him."
5,Swaddling Savior,"I received the Swaddle Me as a shower gift, and thought I would never use it. What was wrong with using good ol' receiving blankets anyway? Well, after realizing that my newborn was able to wiggle out of a receiving blanket within 5 minutes, I decided to try out the Swaddle Me. What a lifesaver! The velcro attachments really make it simple to swaddle, especially when a fussy baby needs to be swaddled quickly. My daughter has yet to break out of the soft and cozy contour fabric. This is a must have for all new (and experienced) parents."
3,my baby was small,"My son was born a month early 6lbs, 6oz. The SwaddleMe just swallowed him. By the time he was large enough to actually sleep in the SwaddleMe he didn't want to be swaddled. We have used receiving blankets until two months and since we have used the Carters Sleep Sacks and they are the same price (if bought from Carter Stores, BRU charges more for Carter Brand). They are fantastic. I think the SwaddleMe is a great idea but I just did not get to use it. The reason for a 3 in rating is because they are very thin and do not keep wiggle worms confined such as my son. He was out in minutes no matter how tight we set it."
5,Worth every dollar! (not that it costs very much),"I thought my seven week old daughter didn't like swaddling because she would always wriggle out of blankets, but I was wrong. I watched a great video about swaddling and was suggested the SwaddleMe wrap, and my daughter loves it. She has been sleeping longer and I don't have to worry about her kicking off her blanket and getting cold. What a great, inexpensive wonder."
4,Good idea but buy *after* baby arrives,"My son was 7 lbs and 19 1/2"" when he was born. I found this swaddler blanket to be a little short for him. He didn't mind having his legs swaddled traditionally but he needs access to his hands. When I tried swaddling just his lower half in this swaddler, he immediately attempted to kick out of it. He will allow his legs to be tightly wrapped otherwise. I don't know why he dislikes this swaddler so much.My daughter loved to be swaddled and I wishh I'd had this for her. My advice is to wait until after Baby comes, get to know to what degree s/he likes to be swaddled and, if so, buy it then.The fabric is super soft and it folds nicely for storage; the product isn't a problem. Like a previous review, I recommend the sleep sack instead. It allows more room for the kicky baby yet provides warmth and comfort for tiny babies."
4,"Nice, but limited use","Very cozy--great for wrapping up after bath to get warm. But honestly, it's usually in the laundry. And since swaddling lasts for a short period of time, it's use is pretty limited. However, when it Is clean, I like having it around."
2,EVERY BABY IS DIFFERENT,"I bought this, I received another type of swaddling blanket and my baby HATED this. She didnt cry more, she screamed more when I tried to swaddle. The velcro was not strong and the way it contoured to my babys body was not smoothing to my daughter.. SO buy 1, receive 1 and if your baby likes it... maybe it will work but it was to no AVAIL for me..."
2,Didn't Work For Our Baby,"The quality of this swaddle blanket is very good, I'm not complaining about that. The problem we've had with our newborn is that as he squirms the blanket rides up and hits his cheeks. This triggers his newborn rooting instinct, which makes him search around frantically for a nipple to suck on. Instead of lulling him to sleep it gets him frantic with hunger.I recommend the sleep sac from this same company instead of this item. We own two of them, and they keep our baby very cozy and warm."
1,Absolutely Useless,"I can swaddle my baby in a receiving blanket much better and tighter than with this particular swaddler. It's just not snug enough. My daughter at just a few weeks old could pop an arm out within minutes. I registered for (and received) 2 of these and i have not used them more than the first attempt. I received another swaddler however, from the hospital gift shop that is made from a thin cotton material (like a t-shirt) with a really long wrapping end and it is wonderful!!!! My daughter (who is now 3 months old) actually smiles when I start to wrap her into it. It is so efficient that I can wrap her at bedtime and she's still snugged into it 7 hours later when she wakes up and she's still smiling. I regretfully do not know the brand of this snuggler but please shop around for it b/f buying this one."
2,Child outgrows it quickly because of poor design!,"I received two of these as a gift. As a first time parent, I thought they looked great for ""swaddling for dummies""! We used one for about two weeks only to discover that our baby (who only weighed 7lb 8oz at birth) was too large for it! The velcro attaches acress of the chest/arm area even though there is tons of space for growth at the feet. In order to get it to close, we had to scoot her down and then fold over the extra fabric at the neck. It kept flipping up and covering her face while she slept. So, we switched to using the sleep sack we received instead and it worked MUCH better. Don't waste your money; just swaddle the old fashioned way w/ receiving blankets."
1,Dangerous.,"I initially loved this product with my newborn- until my baby's head slipped down into the swaddled blanket and he couldnt get it out. Their arms are pinned down (swaddled) so they can't get out if their head sinks into it. Luckily I was right there and saw it and un-velcroed the blanket. It is pretty thick, he would not have been able to breathe through it. Don't put a small baby in one of these. Make sure the baby is big enough/old enough and can't slip in."
2,Better off using a regular blanket.,"I bought this item when I was pregnant, thinking that I would use it a lot on the baby. However, when she came, I found that it was much easier to use a regular receiving blanket or flannel blanket to swaddle her than this thing. This wrap was not tight enough around her legs, and was not adjustable in the leg area. I tried to use this wrap later on as well, but she definitely prefered being tightly swaddled in a regular fleece blanket."
5,A must have!,I wish this swaddler had been around for my two older children! It is a must have for babies-I have bought several for friends having babies because I really think they work.My guy sleeps well feeling warm and coddled wearing his.
5,THE BEST!,"These swaddlers are the best--we used swaddling blankets for the first few months and then I wised up! These take a couple minutes to put on, and they securely cuddle and confine your baby so that they can't flail and wake themselves up. It is a godsend.My only issue is that our baby is huge and he grew out of the small pretty quickly--the large sizes are hard to find, so you have to order on-line."
4,This will be my gift to every new Mum,"I initially decided not to buy this item and discovered after finally buying it, when my son was almost a month old, that it could have really given me some extra sleep. My son couldn't sleep without having his arms and legs pinned down, and swaddling in receiving blankets was a constant battle to get and keep them tight enough. Once I finally bought the ""swaddle me"" it solved the problem. The only drawback to it is that he grew too long for it around seven weeks and could then easily kick the bottom off negating the benefit."
5,Better than recieving blankets,"We have 2 of these! When we used a banket to swaddle our baby, he was loose in no time. This swaddle blanket is great and keeps him all tucked in like a little burrito. Just be sure to velcro it up before washing so it doesn't stick to your baby's good clothes."
3,Save your money!,"This isn't a horrible idea, but my son actually couldn't stand to be swaddled. I couldn't even keep him in a regular blanket. He liked to sleep with his hands up by his head. Mainly I tried to use it just to keep his feet warm. The velcro just wasn't strong enough to keep him swaddled."
4,Good for a while,"I love this product, but you have to make some modifications if you want to use if for more than a couple of weeks. I had to sew some extra velcro patches on the back because it stretches out so bad. I'm still using it, but I have to dry it quite a bit to shrink it so it will still work. My daughter sleeps very soundly in the blanket and she calms right down when she is cuddled up in the swaddle. I am buying this for everyone I know that is pregnant, along with some extra velcro to sew into it!"
3,"Nice, but not necessary","This, and products like it, are nice, but simply not necessary. All you need is the right blanket and a lesson from your nurses at the hospital. In my opinion, if you register for this item and get it, great, but if you don't, don't fret!"
2,It didn't fit my baby.,"My baby was born at 8lbs and he was way too big for this thing. He was hard to put on him too. So I thought maybe he was just too big and I gave it to my freind. He couldn't get is 22 inch long 6 lb baby in it either. It does seem like a great product, I just wonder why it didn't fit my baby. There are so many good reviews, I'd say, try it."
1,Disappointed,I ordered this item thinking it would be plain ivory for my daughter. When I received it the blanket was white with blue trim. I wish the pictures or descriptions would describe the item better next time!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Sleep Saver!,"This is a must for a wriggly baby. My son is 14 weeks and I still wrap him in this. When he is wrapped, he can sleep 8-10 hours straight through the night. He doesn't seem to be tightly swaddled. When they get bigger (he is 24 inches, 14 pds) it is a little tight. I will be very sad when he out grows this."
3,"It was ok, but . . .","The biggest problem I had with this product is that it's made from fleece and as a result, our daughter was over heating every single night!"
2,Unhappy momma,We used these wraps 3 years ago with our first. Loved them! Now with our second we've started using them but no where near happy. As with many products now a days the quality and standards have gone down. The wrap works well for a day or so then after use the Velcro no longer sticks and/or the wrap has streched so the Velcro won't meet up. These wraps are expensive so I expect to get a good product. Will no longer buy and passing the word to all friends and family.
5,"some like it, some don't!","I had one of these for my first son, he was a preemie. everyone said, ""ohhhh he's a little preemie, he'll sleep better if he's bundled tight, swadddle this swaddle that..."" he hated the swaddler. then fat and happy full term baby number two comes..... ""oh, big baby's sleep better at night, you won't need to worry about him...."" Horrible sleeper, up all night to eat, but LOVED the swaddler!!! Don't listen to what everyone says. the stereotypes are all wrong. Baby might hate this and scream to be free (like my first), or sleep great only when he's in it (like my second....). You won't know unless you try though.... ;)"
4,Great product: for first 2 months only!,"I loved having this easy-swaddleme wrap! It was so much easier than getting a blanket and swaddling where it might come apart. The velcro worked really well as it gave ""room to grow."" Swaddling our daughter only lasted for about a month or two, she just totally outgrew this. It was great while it lasted and it's a fantastic shower gift!"
4,Not for All Babies,"My husband & I watched ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" which encourages mothers to swaddle. I bought this product before my baby arrived and to my suprise she hates being swaddled and will do whatever she can to get loose. I found the velcro on this product to be too weak to keep her wrapped up. I would suggest trying to swaddle your infant in regular baby blankets before buying this product which has only one use and if your baby is like mine you might not actually be able to use it. I'm sure it is great for some infants, but I'd experiment with swaddling your baby before making the purchase."
5,CUTE-N-SOFT! BRAYLON IS ASLEEP IN NO TIME! BUY THIS PRODUCT.,I REGISTERED FOR THE ONE IN YELLOW. I LIKED IT SO MUCH I ORDERED THE ONE IN BLUE. THE YELLOW ONE WAS PLAIN BUT THIS ONE CAME WITH BONUS WRAPS IN THE SHAPE OF TEDDY BEARS. HOW CUTE!!OUR BABY IS SOUND ASLEEP!!! LOVE IT!!!!IT'S TOTALLY HOT!!!! ...AND SO WORTH THE $9.99! CAN'T GET MUCH BETTER!
2,It's OK,"I bought this because I had heard swaddling would help infants sleep. My son hated to be swaddled but my daughter loved it. I went searching for a swaddle blanket and came upon these. They really come undone way too quickly for my tastes and they don't neccesarily lay right so it always seemed as if I was pushing it down to keep the blanket from covering her nose. Plus the noise from the velcro would startle my daughter and wake her instead of a ""quiet"" diaper change. I prefer the Miracle Blanket, a lot more $$ but definitely worth the price. She was swaddled until she was 4 months old."
2,Try something else...,"For a young infant who isn't active, the SwaddleMe is a nice alternative to traditional receiving blankets. However, if you have a wiggler, this item isn't going to help. Our baby lasted in this swaddler for maybe three weeks until he figured out how to kick out of it. Once he got his legs free, he'd wiggle around until the material was bunched up around his neck--not a very comforting sight. So, we bought ""The Amazing Miracle Blanket."" It was truly amazing--it's practically impossible for a young infant to even loosen the material let alone get out of it. Baby started sleeping in the Miracle Blanket at 8 weeks and immediately was down for 7 to 8 hours at a stretch. We finally had to put it up when, at 5 months, he no longer needed, or wanted, to be swaddled. It's $29.99, but worth every penny. They have a website--www.miracleblanket.com. Also, the SwaddleMe uses velcro, which is ridiculously loud when you're trying to quietly change baby in the middle of the night."
3,Great when you can get it on right.,"I took this to the hospital when my daughter was born and it's wonderful when you can get it wrapped correctly, but I often had trouble figuring it out. My daughter didn't desire to be swaddled for very long after birth, so I didn't get that much use of of them (I have them in ivory and pink) but still a great idea."
5,HAD TO WAKE HER UP!,"I had read the reviews on SwaddleMe and was excited to buy one for my granddaughter Allison, who was born Nov of 2008. It was going to be a Christmas present! Christmas eve Allison was fussy so I talked her parents into opening up the SwaddleMe and they tried it on her that night. Allison's mom had to wake her up on Christmas day! So it was actually two gifts in one. First, a full night's sleep for her parents and secondly, a secure good night's sleep for Allison! They love this item and even pack it with them to daycare. As a grandmother, I highly recommend this item as being on the top of the list for all new parents as well as the child. Make life easier and happier for your baby with a SwaddleMe, you'll be glad you did!"
5,Great toy!!!,"This toy is the perfect size, not too big, not too small. It is easily cleaned. As advertised, can't be heard...in the same room or in nearby areas...thank the Goddess. The different speeds are very nice. One minor thing,that was a little inconvenient,is that the vibration speed setting dial is very sensitive. A slight touch may send it higher than you want or expected. Other than that, this is a great buy."
2,"Doc Johnson Silent Vibrations Pearl, Pink with White Band",I have enjoyed this vibrator so far but my only frustration with it would be that the battery cap on the end cracked after I had a difficult time trying to open it. This vibrator barely lasted me a month before it cracked. It is still working and usable as of now but I am not sure at all if it will break completely in the future.
2,Fiosrt Review,I did not really like the soundtrack. I could not find a really good song on it although I love the movie.
4,Moldex 2400N95 Organic Vapor N95 Dust Mask,"This mask is lightweight, crush-resistant, and comfortable to wear all day long. I teach in an anatomy lab and this mask is a lifesaver whenever I forget to pack my full-face respirator. In fact, this is the same mask they sell to students at the nearby med school for their anatomy lab. There is real activated carbon sandwiched between the filter elements. The exhalation valve works well early on, but tends to stick shut as condensation collects. Don't forget to store it in a sealed plastic bag when not in use; that will help to extend its useful life."
3,A little confused,"I purchase these for our pool techs that are around chemicals...they are easier to give out to the guys than the full respirators that they just lose anyway...at least if they lose these they are not $40/each.I am confused though because I purchase them because they are rated for acidic vapors, but the package reads something to the effect of ""less than OSHA"" which bothers me...if they are not what OSHA would approve, then I guess they are not good enough for what we need."
4,nice fan w/cryptic instructions,"I'm not very handy, so I rely on instructions to assemble most items. The instructions here would have been much more useful if they just said ""Figure it out yourself."" Once I put it together, which didn't take very long, it's a very servicable fan. I'm not too sensitive to noise, but it has a nice hum to it."
1,Horrible fan,"I'm the type of person who cannot deal with noisy fans. The first one of these Amazon shipped to me was really noisy and sounded like it was grinding metal. So, I sent it back and got a new one. This one was the fan from hell, it was shaking and sounded like it was grinding metal like the first one. If you want a fan to sleep with it on, you will end up wanting to kill yourself if you order this one. I have tried around fifteen different fans, and cannot for the life of me find one that I can sleep with it on without hearing high pitch noises or rattling. The only this fan would be good for is to put in your garage."
1,Blatant false statement on product description,"Fan comes in even more pieces with even more screws than a comparable larger fan from another brand that I purchased last year. So much for ""no assembly required."" I didn't purchase this model so I could have a fan that was too short -- I chose it specifically because of ""no assembly required"" in the listing. Manual arrived shoved into fanblade casing, requiring it to be tugged through a too-small hole and partially shredded just to access. If this is a taste of how easy and sensible the assembly process will be, count me out."
1,bad,"This item was poorly packed--very difficult to put together --it's just a plain shoddy fan. I would return it, but the time has run out!! Nancy peck"
3,Overall pretty good,"I bought this mouse because I was tired of the corded mouses and having to clean out the ball every other week. It's really nice and smooth and no cleaning out any ball. It runs smoothly and it looks nice, however, you need to change the batteries constantly. I change my battery about every 3 weeks and it uses 2 AA batteries, that adds up. This mouse alsmo isn't ideal for gaming, as it doesn't run smoothly in games; you'll be better off with a corded mouse. Overall, it's a good mouse, just pricey to maintain. I would suggest getting the newer versions where you can recharge the batteries."
5,I absolutely LOVE this mouse!,"I have had this mouse for almost 2 months now, and not had to change the batteries once. As a matter of fact, I've not had any problems with it at all! It moves easily, works perfectly, and feels great in my hand. I highly recommend this cordless mouse. It's less expensive than most of the others, and with the mail in rebate, you can't miss!"
5,Insight into my fathers service in wwII,"My father was a top terret gunner in the B-24 in the 15th airforce 449 bomber group stationed in Grottalie, Italy. He spoke very little about the war. This book gave an insight into what my father life was like durning his 55 missions. It was a great book for my family."
5,Required Reading for Travel Service Careers,"I really liked the format of the book -- it was extremely easy to follow. I could find the same type of information in the same location in each chapter. As I am trying to decide whether I want to make a change to another area in the industry, I appreciated that the book gave me great comparison information, including current salaries. The recommended internet links will certainly reduce my time surfing the web for the information and sites that are important to me! I already have recommended the book to my colleagues, and feel that it should be required reading for anyone in college or who wants to make a career change in the travel service industry."
3,Definitely old-school,"I ordered this because I love the wired keyboard. Not sure if worth it, as this is the older wireless technology, a big, cabled port instead of little usb dongle, and can't turn the mouse or keyboard OFF, so goes through batteries quickly. while I love the feel of the keyboard, the mouse is really big and clunky and awkward, and since they use the same port, I can't give or sell the mouse to someone else so that's a waste.BUT I love the old keyboards and have trouble typing so the new slim ones just don't work for me, so I'll be keeping this for when I do want to use wireless keyboard. Only ordered because I loved the wired one and don't need wireless right now, but thought I'd better grab while available!"
2,There are better books available,"Don't be fooled by the title - this book is not about WorkPlace Shell (WPS) programming. It's about Presentation Manager (PM) programming. What's the difference? PM is the underlying graphical API for OS/2. The WPS is the object-oriented user interface that sits on top of PM. It has its own API which is used to extend the WPS itself. The author of this book doesn't seem to understand this distinction, because there is absolutely no discussion on the WPS API. In fact, the last chapeter is titled ""WPS Programming"", but that's just not accurate.Having said all this, this book is below average, hence the two-star rating. As far as PM programming books go, there are better ones out there. Not only that, but this book is not easy to read. The text is just confusing, and only people who already know PM programming would understand it. In other words, the author is a bad teacher."
3,Your only choice,"If you have an Epson printer, you pretty much have no choice but to buy their ink. (In fact, this goes any with manufacturer.) I strongly recommend against using any third-party ink cartridges, as I have had nothing but bad experience with them in the past.This ink cartridge gives you what you expect: never enough pages for what you pay! Fortunately Amazon gives us a very good price, so we can afford to buy just a few more per year."
4,Short life span.,"This cartridge works fine in my Epson Photo printer when using Epson photo paper, producing rich blacks. However, the cartridge is rapidly depleted with use. Also,if it's not used for a while, it requires a prolonged, ink-wasting head cleaning session. (just as with it's complimentary color cartridge)."
1,Very Unhappy With Your Product,I order two ink cartridges from your company recently for my Epson Sytlus Photo 820 (Black and Color). Neither one of them have been worth the money spent. They do not provide ink. I purchase alot of ink for my printer and was hoping to find a suppler to fulfill my needs but your product flunked big time.
3,inkjet cartridge,I purchased this cartridge as a replacement for the one I had that ran out of ink. It seems to be fine.
5,I have tried several off brands and they don't stack up with factory cartridges.,I have spent over 2 hours filling out how I rate products that I bought through the last year or so and then you have to have 20 more words in order for me to submit my ratting. This is it.
3,Overpriced ink works.,"I use the Epson T007201 ink on my venerable Epson Stylus Photo 900. It works well, though I occasionally have to do a ""head cleaning"" run if it sits awhile.Like all printer ink, it is horribly overpriced. Equally annoying are the ""low ink"" warnings you receive LONG before the cartridge is empty. I can still print out 100+ pages of text after the first warning. As if we weren't getting gouged enough . . ."
4,Free shipping makes the difference,"Finding printer ink in my small town is impossible. Instead of driving an hour or so, I decided to find a place to order online. Prices on Amazon are fairly comparable to other sites, but I've had good success with ordering from Amazon in the past and I felt more comfortable ordering my ink from them. Free shipping sealed the deal. I didn't need them overnight, so I could take advantage of the free ground shipping...and they even arrived a bit earlier than the estimated date of arrival given when I ordered. I was able to track the shipping so I knew to look for them early."
3,two genre- collection,"these stories are to be divided into two: drama and horror. Hartley is a writer believing mich in subtlety. his style is intelligent, subtle and realistic. what he is truly great at is dialogue. no melodrama, no unrealistic logic, still it carries the reader excactly where he should he, and this without the story being boring or losing relevance. i must admit i only like the horror stories. Hartley is a underrated horror writer, perhaps because his style is so subtle you have to read it a couple of times to really appreciate it. but some of the stories are a little to uninteresting to me."
4,Great Overall Guide for the Greek Islands,"I bought this guide to use for a recent cruise to the Greek Islands. It was a perfect choice for the cruise experience. No matter where we went, adequate maps and enough information to spend a half or whole day exploring was well presented. I would also recommend it for planning a vacation. All of the islands are covered as well as how to get there and how to find acceptable accomodations. From what we discovered, the recommendations were right on. I would highly recommend this guide for anyone who wants to know a bit about all of the islands. It also covered Athens, although if you are a guide book junkie like me, you will want a separate guide if you plan to be more than one day in Athens."
1,Of Minimal Help,"This book had very few useful details like where to eat, sleep, sightsee or shop. The best feature was its explanations of ancient Grecian sites. Overall, I regret purchasing it. I relied more on Fodor's for the practical aspects of my trip."
4,"normal 0.27dpi, but excellent price/quality","Although they try to confuse some consumer with the 0.23 horz. dpi hype. The montior is really a normal .027dpi. (To calculate it's sq. root of the sum of .23 sq (horzintal dpi) and .14 sq (vertical dpi): [(.23*.23)+(.14*.14)]^(1/2) = actually dpi .27 That horizontal dot pitch nonsense is the latest marketing gimmick from monitor manufacturers (and I hate it).Another problem is the fact that the factory settings are set at 9000's something kelvin and other to extreme to show up sharper on show room floor. So adjusting is needed, with the kelvin about 6500 would have a more true look.A side from that, this Monitor replaces the V95 with a little less feature and is actually dimmer, however the lower cost and quality is a bang for the buck monitor. The Q95 is excellent for gaming or any home user need."
5,"Inexpensive, yet beautiful","This monitor Is amazingly SWEET, it dosent have quite the footprint on your desk as a normal 19' monitor, its easily the most system compatible monitor I've seen. Getting into the graphics themselves, I am an avid gamer, and have used this monitor at other's houses before. It is simply gorgeous!"
5,a book can move all races,"I am writing this book review in Taiwan where are many ethnic conflics. I read In search of April Raintree in 1995 and was moved so deeply and then it became one of my favorite books. Cullton exposures the tough situations of ethnic minorities in white-supreme societies, and indicates a better way to her people and all human-beings how to conquer this problem by heart. I would to recommend this book to all readers and translate it into Chinese and find some publication company to publish its Chinese-version. Wish a just world."
5,I was moved to tears.,"This book is a grim account of two native sisters in Canada. Both sisters are put in different foster homes and experience racism, discrimination and other injustices because of the color of their skin. The main part of the book is about the older sister finding her identity. She grew up denying her native blood and heritage. It's touching how she finally came to honor her native heritage.I was moved by this book and I experienced many feelings. Oftentimes I felt anger and other times I felt a deep sadness. My tear drops have stained more than a few pages. Excellent book and a must read for all people of all nationalities."
3,Inexpensive shredder for future Enron executives,"This model is under-powered, and jams when overfed. That said, this shredder is also one of the cheapest shredders on the market. It also has an automatic feeder sensor, so you don't have to turn it on and off constantly-- just stick the paper in and it starts shredding.To summarize.it works - just the way I like it.If you only shred a few documents a month (credit card bills, bank statements), then there really isn't a point in laying out several hundred dollars. I would recommend this one, or similar shredder.On the other hand, if you have a lot of papers to dispose of, you might want to invest in a higher priced and higher quality model."
2,Good for a year...,"My wife purchased this item for my home office two years ago. After two years of light work, this product fails to shred one sheet of paper at a time....Good for one year only...!!!!"
1,Piece of junk,Failed in less than six months. Leaking oil. Probably cut less than 50 sheets of normal business paper. Don't buy this unit.
3,They really tried,"This is one film that definitely grows on you after repeated viewings. The first time I saw it I thought it had a lot of problems; and it does, but it also has several things going for it. The special effects and scenery are very well done for the time. The film also really tries to show what tribes and cultures may have been like. There is also an attempt to create a tribal language which may seem silly at first, but when one watchs the film a few times you can begin to see a continuity to what the film makers tried to do. This film is definitely worth taping or buying because you will want to watch it over and over."
1,Assinine,"There's no point in belaboring the scientific inaccuracies of this movie or nit-picking the roughness of the special effects. What's damning is the earnest, self-righteous, preachiness of the script rendered incomprehensible by an attempt to recreate a neolithic language. In this ancient world blonds are considered inferior so they're segregated from the rest of the tribe. Blonds are Black! Get it!?!?! This is what drives the plot and if you've seen some of the early Star Trek's cheesier episodesthen you needn't waste your time. Watching this movie is likewaiting in the office of a sadistic dentist who hasn't got anything for patients to read except the Salvation Army War Cry.I enjoy bad movies. I even own a copy of Robot vs. the Aztec Mummy AND I don't mind admitting it. But this film is bad beyond redemption."
1,very small!,"I was extremely disappointed when I got those earrings as they turned to be microscopic in size! I will never wear them, because they don't catch the eye. On the picture those items look completely different."
1,Poorly Made,"I watched part of this movie the other night. I just couldn't finish the whole thing. And I am not talking about the subject. I know the Richard Speck story and how he slaughtered 8 student nurses in 1966. It just did not come together like it could have. I thought the acting was good but the film is terribly made.The Asian girl who survived by hiding under a bed really did get out of the witness chair and walk over to Speck, point and say he was the man who killed her roommates. The film makers show this moment, but on film, or at least this film, it didn't pack the punch it could have.The film was dark, bizarre and boring. If you want to learn about Richard Speck and the student nurses he murdered, watch a good documentary or read a good article."
1,waste of time,"Scott M. Cook Initial post This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. Poor picture quality and second rate actors. Michael feifer had an opportunity to create a good picture but half fast the whole process and created trash. He fails in many ways to tell the whole story. Don't waste your money buying this or even renting this. Aug 20, 2007 6:33 PM PDT"
1,"I've seen better episodes of ""Cops""","It would be cruel to bad mouth the acting in this low budget abomination, but how can I be cruel when there really wasn't an actor on camera? Corin Nemec should take up dock work...working at the docks. This attempt to bring life to a deadly true story makes me wonder. Was there ever a good movie made about this horrific crime? If so, please let me know. The music was overpowering and the whimpering girls were way overdone. Granted, I'd be scared witless too if this maniac was on the loose, but the script, acting, editing and screenplay was embarrassing. If you want to watch this, don't pay $3.99 for a rental...you can probably pick it up at the 99 Cent Only store for (that's right)...99 cents. Even then you got ripped off. You'd be better off watching an episode of ""Cops"" on cable."
5,"Substantial, well written and precise","An excellent work for anyone who wants to learn Christian Philosophy as taught by the Catholic Church. It is a faithful and comprehensive synthesis of the teaching of the Magisterium and would serve well as a text for courses in Christian Philosophy.Deacon Richard C. Caporiccio, MA - Theology, Notre Dame Graduate School of Christendom College, and Advanced Chatechical Diploma, The Holy See"
3,it's ok,"If you're looking for a cheap keyboard, it's ok. It's not great. The keys are not as quiet as the description says.But for a cheap keyboard, it does the trick."
4,Reader,"Its a concise book and deals mostly with the Monte Carlo simulation technique as used in semiconductor device modeling.Chap 1 and 2 provide the groundwork,chap 2 in fact lists most of the scattering mechanisms with their mathematical formulations,the equations derived therein are later used for developing fortran codes.There are fortran codes scattered all over the book and the appendix includes a full code too.Anyone who wishes to use Monte Carlo simulation for device modeling could use this book as a starting point.The list of references given are to an extent comprehensive,most of the papers suggested appear in the publications of the American physical society or published by Elsevier and are precursor to the current level of device modeling.This book shall make a good reading, though the price at $128 may be on the higher side."
2,"Lackluster, overly long, artificial","Having enjoyed some recent reading of urban fantasy, I eagerly anticipated reading Changer. However, Lindskold doesn't have the flare of the other authors I'd read. Her story was plodding and despite an interesting take on the myths we all know (most mythical beings did exist and were often playing similar parts in various stories) she was never able to develop it into a compelling plot. Her characters talk a bit more sophisticated than the Superfriends. There's no mystery as to who the villains are nor their ""plot to take over the world"". And the work drags far too long (although it'd be better if it didn't drag at all). I'd recommend either ""American Gods"" by Neil Gaiman or ""Somplace to Be Flying"" by Charles De Lint. Both cover similar material and do a far better job of it."
1,didn't help me,"I got this product to get rid of screches on steinless steel oven, but it didn't work at all, as people described."
4,Works on Polyurethane as well,Used this on 12 coats of polyurethane after sanding with 320 and 600 in between coats and then wet sanding with 1500 and 2000 grit. Leaves a bit of a haze but finished off with 3M swirl mark remover. Great shine!
4,does what it says on the tin,I do a lot of my own art design and printing and am frequently dismayed by the lack of imaginative artwork available from professional T.Shirt manufacturers.Also often dissapointed with goods I've ordered online. I have often desired to try using my own designs but was sceptical of results achievable using a home printer.Decided this week to give Epson cool transfer paper a try - carefully following instructions and using an expendable T shirt to experiment.I needn't have worried - worked perfect first time. There are plenty of pale pastel shade fabrics available that show off the prints superbly ~ these can be inexpensive and make the process cost effective. Laundered and handled carefully they give sufficient wear to provide a decorative alternative and cheap way to customise casual clothing. I'm impressed.
2,Confusing Instructions,Step.3 ...insert transfer paper with the blank side (printable surface) loaded correctly.Both sides are blank. I found out the hard way and melted the film on the iron which is now useless.TIP: glossy side is the printable side
3,Works well for the price and ease,"The print itself looks great, but when you cut it out and iron it on your white t-shirt, you can see the white background and it looks pretty amateurish. It also has a rather slick feel to it, but I guess most transfers do. It probably wouldnt look very good at all on a t-shirt other than white. But for a quick way to make one or a few custom t-shirts, its very easy, and will get ok results. Try it out, but use a new, white t-shirt."
4,Allright.,"Works fine.Colors look real nice on light fabric,and for the price, it's a real deal.Cons.Instructions are pretty much useless, had to guess on how to load printerSometimes leaves a nasty layer if not ironed rightforget printing on dark colors."
2,Try a different brand,"What a disappointment! I've used t-shirt transfer paper many times before, and this type by Epson has been the hardest to use, by far. I was making 6 matching Ts and each came out differently... the glue on the transfer paper yellows, adheres inconsistently and the directions are difficult to follow. You have to pay close attention to how you load it into the computer because it's impossible to tell one side from another. Ironing too long (or actually as long as the directions say to) results in a yellowed appearance. Too short, and the image is true to color, but pulls off of the shirt. Taking the paper off is an exact science... it has to be just right, not to hot/cold or you either won't get the paper off or it'll result in glue globs on the T-shirt. Better luck with Avery!"
1,Did not wash well,"This was very difficult to apply, as it takes intense heat over quite a while to get it to stick. After I applied it, it began to peel off the first time I washed the t-shirt. I tried it twice.I was very disappointed in this product."
1,Terrible product,"This is a terrible product. I carefully followed the directions in applying the transfers. Some of the edges didn't look all that great, so I decided to cover the edges with sewn on trim. Wish now I hadn't bothered. Washed the (100% organic cotton) tees in cold water, turned inside out. My plan was to hang the tees up to dry, but they came out of the washer (used delicate cycle) all cracked and generally awful. Definitely ruined some tees."
2,Does not last very long.,"I have used iron-on transers in the past, but I could not remember which brand, so I tried these Epson iron-on transfers because of their price. Unfortunately, after following the directions carefully, the actual transfer started to break-up and wear off after just a couple washings. I do not recommend this product unless you are only going to wear your t-shirt once or twice. After a few washings, the images look like they have been washed a hundred times."
1,Disaster with an iron,"Don't try to use this product with an HP printer, or using a dark t-shirt. I used a simple two tone image printed with a HP Photosmart 7660. While the image on the paper was clear when printed, and I was able to get the paper aligned correctly prior to printing, the final product was horrible. When I peeled back the paper what was left on the dark green shirt was a mess. The image was dim, the residue that remained on the shirt looked like some sort of disease. The final result was the creation of three paint rags, since the images were so bad I wouldn't even wear them to take out the trash. If you need to have a few custom shirts take your image to a local printer and don't bother with this product. What you waste in ruined shirts more than offsets the cost of having the job done right."
4,"Fun, Cheap, and Durable","I purchased this product to make some cheap t-shirts at home. The product is fairly easy to use once you get the hang of it. Be prepared to know how to reverse an image prior to printing as the print will need to be the mirror image of your picture for correct transfer. THe process takes about 30 minutes to create a shirt from print to iron. The shirts that I have made have lasted at least 50 washes, and have faded a little. However the fade gives them that nice rustic, vintage, look. Worked great with an HP inkjet printer. Works with a laser printer as well but may not always have the best quality (and be sure to print on the correct side)."
4,Good Product!,This is a good product. It can get scorch easily if you get impaient. Make sure you use a pressing cloth. Over all the colors and design transfered well onto the shirt.
2,Which side is which?,"A simple identification mark on the ironable side would make this product so much more user friendly. I also have a messed up iron and two wasted transfers. None of these iron-on transfer brands are inexpensive products so I recommend that you cut off a piece of the transfer paper, put a mark on it and practice first with some old fabric to see which side is ironable. I have a bottom printer tray and followed their instructions re: cut corner placed appropriately and that was not the correct side."
1,These transfers blow!,I am comparing these transfers to the HP transfers for colored shirts. these require a reverse image and are just not user friendly. after three unsuccessful attempts I just went back to the more expensive HP's. The transfers did not adhere well and would flake off in little chunks even before you tried to wash them.
1,Worst directions!,"The directions show that the image should be printed so there is a notch at the top right of the paper (#6 under ""printing"") when you look at your printed image (see the picture of a mustached man with a chef hat). This is wrong, the notch should be in the top left. I called customer service, who said that I had to mail back the non-printed sheets of paper or else I couldn't get my ""Satisfaction Guarantee"" refund (this after I printed all the sheets at work so I could take them home to iron-on to my tshirts). Not sure why Epson wants sheets of paper back - I'm sure they don't resell them. Plus, now my iron has gooey stuff on it from trying to iron the wrong side. Would it be so hard for them to make a mark on the back of the paper so you know which side to print on?Total waste of time to read the directions. You need to have your iron and your printer in the same place so that you can figure out how to use the paper by yourself."
4,Nice way to make a personalized t-shirt,"I am making a bunch of t-shirts for my son's birthday. Epson is the first brand I used and Avery is the second brand. I've never done iron-ons before this.Avery has much brighter colors but it feels more waxy, which I'm not sure will disappear with washing. Epson has duller colors but the less waxy feel is a plus. After washing, it feels even more softer and I don't notice right off that it's an iron-on.After washing, the Epson image is a little faded, but it's not cracked or anything. I'm sure if we had followed washing instructions, the colors would probably be more nicely preserved, but we are too lazy for that.My husband wants me to make him a bunch of shirts now, so I'd say he is impressed enough."
4,Not bad at all!,"I liked this book. I can't say it's the best ever, because I haven't read so many. This is my third SVU book. Everything starts when Tom gets an internship in New Orleans, working with a young, but famous, journalist. He puts a picture of Elizabeth on his desktable, and the problems - and fun for the reader - start. My favourite part was definitely where Tom figures out that, well, SOMEONE, is a vampire. You can't stop reading until you finished the book."
1,Probably the worst SVU book I've read,"A vampire. Yeah. This book was totally unrealistic and illogical. It was boring, too- the actual story started around the middle of the book. It left me with lots of unanswered questions. This book is a weird jump between ""Shipboard wedding"" and ""Behind closed doors""."
5,The Best!,"I have tons of Sweet Valley books, and I must say, this is the best! I have read Kiss of the Vampire around 3-4 times, and I do not get tired! Elizabeth totally loses her head, while Tom loses his head to save her! Fun-loving Jessica keeps flirting like crazy, while the evil ice-princess Alison Quinn gets what's coming for her! Sweet Valley Fans, this one you must not miss!"
1,That's not truth,I purchased this.it must be strong level3 but they gave me 2 and said the company doesn't make 3 anymore . Lieeeeeeee
1,good spray bad seller,"This is a good spray overall compared to all the other sprays I have used before. I give the spray 5 stars actually but I bought the 15.2 oz, and the seller sent me a 9oz one. I just got scammed?"
4,Freeze!,I love OSIS hair care products. This hairspray is of an excellent strength hold for my hair (thin). It doesn't leave any greasy residue and lasts forever never needing a second spray.
2,NOT FOR ME,I purchased this because my hairdresser highly recommended it. I'm so disappointed. It is sticky and seems to weigh my hair down. I guess everybodys hair is different.
4,enigmatic,Bellefleur is a unique and magical novel which requires of the reader only a fertile imagination and the desire for a rattling good story. A cast of characters you have never met before and a plot which keeps you guessing.
2,Difficult to read because it is chronologically challenging.,Our bookclub found this long epic difficult to read because it is chronologically challenging. Ms. Oates takes you through many generations of the Bellefleur family but not in order. She constantly flip flops between the present and past and the reader must check the family tree in the beginning of the book to stay focused. It becomes too tedious and detracts from some fascinating characters. Her descriptions are delightful and funny if you can get past the confusing format.
1,Dreadful,"Kudos to the reviewer who said he gave this book one star because he could not give it zero! In total, 684 pages wasted in telling the convoluted, confusing, overblown, and completely unbelievable story of a family you would hate to know, let alone read about. While it is the definitive thesis on how not to use the parenthetical phrase, surely this mess cannot be considered the culmination of the author's lifework."
3,Bellefleur,"I find myself always swept along in the exquiste flow of Oates prose; reading this book was no exception. The problem, ultimately, is that this river really doesn't go anywhere. I kept reading and reading, in the (vain)hope that the legion of Bellefleur ancestors brought to life by Ms. Oates would somehow bring the crises of the most current generation into focus and illuminate some kind of significant narrative trajectory. It never materialized for me. It's very possible that I missed essential clues and themes in the individual chapters. However, if they were there as part of some cohesive plan on Ms. Oates part, I didn't discern them. I thought about spending more time trying to tease out of the text some kind of larger meaning, but decided in the end that it just wasn't worth my time.I would have given this book four stars except that Ms. Oates has set the bar much higher herself with several of her earlier works, which most certainly are worth the time."
5,the wild north,glad to finaly have this movie available on dvd. very happy with the dvd and the way it was manufactured. very satisfied.
1,the wild north,could not watch this as australia is a region 4 and the u .s is a region 1 dvd area.did not see anything in the ad to warn me of this.have been told this a good movie
4,Very romantic and entertaining Book,The book underscores the love of you life my be some one under your nose. Had equally strong characters in comptempory times. I enjoyed the book. AN easy fun read
2,Not very good,"This book isn't really worth reading. It passes the time, but it isn't really all that entertaining and it's very easy to put down. The characters have very unrealistic conversations and seem pretty immature to me (One scene has them playing a strip Boggle/combination truth or dare game). To top it off, there is a ""magical"" necklace involved that the characters all-to-readily accept as being the force that brings them together. If you're looking for an interesting read, pass on this one."
4,Auric the composer,"Georges Auric has long fascinated me as one of the also-rans of Les Six. He's the one that turned to writing movie music and running opera houses. This CD shows him as a composer, and it reveals him to be a fairly conventional post-romantic - tonal, with square phrased, danceable rhythms spiced by mild dissonance, brilliant orchestration, acidic brass, and a Cocteau scenario. There's a sense of pictorialism, motion, but no sharp characterization. A touch of Prokofiev with large dollops of Honegger or Poulenc, but not the wit, the melodic sense, the skewed tonality. These are highly energetic scores, impressive, but I understand better now why Auric is passed over. The performances are superb."
4,great textbook,"Had to buy this book for one of my 300 level courses. With all honesty, this was a very good book. Informative, with detailed descriptions of diagrams and very well organized. From chapter to chapter, you'll be exposed to multiple processes that need to be covered before designing a system. Each process is beautifully explained, with colorful pages and a number of great examples.It makes learning easy.I learned a lot, and will definitely keep it handy."
1,horribly written book,"horribly written book, go to their website and download the powerpoint slides, I've passed two classes with McGraw books just by studying the Powerpoint slides, I received an A in each class."
4,Fun game for a fan of the show & casual gamer,"Usually I get to the last boss of a game and just move onto the next game. This was the first game I finished in a long time. It's not very hard but is fun with a few puzzles and mostly straightforward gameplay. It's too short and not too hard but it was really fun. I enjoyed it so much I am getting the new one today. For those who aren't hardcore gamers and get discouraged by really hard games, this is a nice title."
3,avatar,my son enjoyed this game but it is still a little hard for him to get through so i can't give it five stars
4,good and fun game,I bought this game at my DS2. it is very great and funAlthough the graphic little lower resolutionBut the game was fun and my nephew like to play for it too
2,Meh.,"The plot is messed up, and unorganized. The grammer is horrable at times. The game doesn't even take advantage of the many features the DS provides. At some points, it is exciting, and you get to take control of Aang, Sokka, Katarta, Haru, and even Momo during your play. The graphics are excellent, but it's easy to get lost on a big map. Not the best game. I would happily recommend a better game, like Animal Crossing: Wild world, or Nintendogs."
2,Doesn't Work,"I bought this for my 5 year old son who is very into skateboarding. We have a pool so I thought this would be perfect. He, and now many others (kids and adults) have tried to use it and it simply doesn't do anything other than float on top of the water. How they got the picture of the kid riding it under the water I have no idea. If someone could tell me how to use this I'd really appreciate it. If not, we basically have another swim noodle."
3,AMAZON PRICES ARE GOING THRU THE ROOF,"I have bought thousands (& thousands and thousands) of dollars worth of everything imaginable from wonderful Amazon.com but this Christmas I noticed that they are starting to charge exorbitant amounts -- more than even the manufacturer's published prices on a lot of items, specifically Lego Bionicle-type items. This product for example is $[...] less both in the official Lego magazine my child gets and in Toys R Us both in-store & on-line. Why is that? Why are they willing to jeopardize a wonderful and successful business model and why at a time when the public needs more than ever to trust them? What's going on Amazon? What about your (former) low price guarantee. Just look up this item at Toys R US dot com for a perfect example --- one of many I have found this season."
4,Good strategies for family,"I highly recommend this book that was recommended by our daughter's psychologist. The first several chapters deal with the idea that no one ""makes"" us mad, but ourselves. It discusses the thoughts that create/perpetuate anger and how to stop those thoughts and change the inner dialogue. Latter chapters deal more with other members of the family. Very well written with chapter highlights summarized at the end of each chapter, so it's easy to go back and review w/o re-reading. Highly recommend it if anger is an issue in your family."
5,retro fun,"This cookbook from decades ago, once all the rage for starving grad students and others on a tight budget, is a great nostalgic read. Although by today's world cuisine standards, the recipes are limited in scope, nevertheless they are tasty and satisfying. If you come at this book from a ""retro, kitschy"" approach, you may be surprised. (Or maybe not. It does satisfy at that level also!)While the meatball recipes look as if they may all taste alike (and many do), they are quick, inexpensive, and do indeed fill up a hungry family. The three criteria may be all that matters, some evenings, to a person-in-charge-of-dinner at the end of a frazzled day. If your Trader Joe groceries are running low, turn to this book to find a ""step-back-in-time"" meal of oldtime American cuisine!"
4,Bought a used old copy,"I bought a used old copy of this book for my mom to replace one she had when I was little. It has my favorite recipe for Swedish meatballs in it. If this is being sold new, I can not review that version, the one I got had to have been printed in 1980 at the latest."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"My 16 month old daughter can easily pull these off the tub and even when she doesn't, they don't stay in place. These tub treads will certainly not keep her from slipping in the tub. I've purchased a non-slip mat from Target and placed these treads along the side of the tub for my daughter to play with."
4,"Cute tub decore for my elmo fanatic, not really for safety.","I bought these to go on the walls of my bath tub since my son is OBSESSED with elmo (which is why I have reviews for LOTS of elmo things (= ) I wouldnt use these if you are truly concerned with your child not slipping in the bath tub. But if you want something to make bath time a little more fun these are pretty cool. There aren't many in the pack, so I have the frog ones I had originally decorated our tub with along with Elmo in the bath."
5,A POIGNANT NOVEL ABOUT THE TIMES WE LIVE IN. IT COULD HAPPEN,"A truely distressing novel depicting the utter hopelessness of all out thermonuclear war. Character developed is given high priority in this techno-thriller of war and the war torn countries it affects. Harry's narrative gives you so much more than just explosive action. You'll feel as though you've witnessed the real thing through the eyes of every character. From the highest govenment official to the lowest gunt on the blood covered battle field, everyone looses something, I had to put it down every so often just to get my emotions in order. Gut wrenching to say the least"
2,Not very impressed,"I'm amazed everyone rates this book so highly. I found the characters extremely forgettable, barely any warmth or character depth to them. They produced no feelings of empathy in me at all. Half way in and after hundreds of nuclear detonations dotted around the US, you'd hardly have known. Most people seem to be getting on with life as if nothing had happened.The unfolding of the plot was simply ridiculous. I know we have some inept leaders but I can't believe any group of people would act in so patently a stupid way, especially the events leading up to the impeachment process.I only finished the book because I was hoping it might suddenly pull together at some point but it never did."
5,"Highly recommended, a page turner!","I read this book twice several years ago, it is intense, largely unexpected, and can keep you awake until dawn. It is very well researched, it depicts a global war situation that is inimaginable for most Americans, yet it is quite not impossible in the foreseeable geopolitical scenario. The book would make a great movie or perhaps a great short TV miniseries. Mr Harry has a unique talent for genre; I always wondered why he had not written more war technothrillers. I plan to read it one more time soon."
2,A low quality product from a formerly good company.,"These are roughly-finished Chinese castings with Chinese outer races already pressed in.Having had bad experience with Chinese bearings, I pressed out the outer races to put in good SKF ones. One of them pressed out normally, and the other one almost fell out. I couldn't believe the difference.The SKF outer races pressed in about the same way, with one going in normally, and one going in very easily.I also cut my finger on one of the rough edges left by the poor machining. .I fear that the rough machining on the friction surface will wear down my pads quickly."
3,Nice book and nice photos,"Nice book and well written. Not quite technically though but more geared towards the people that wore/wear them; there are some interesting anecdotes in it as well. However, if you want to read about all the ins and outs of e.g. Tahitian and/or South Sea pearls, I'd recommend the pearl book by Schoeffel or ""Cultured Pearls, the first 100 years"". Neverthess, it remains a very enjoyable book."
3,A Life In Jokes Is Not Funny,"The initial idea of Mr. Hope putting his life into jokes sounds good. He was a comedian. He was good at what he did. What better way could he relay his life story? The problem is that all together, these jokes lose their humor.The book might be useful for quotes, but overall as an autobiography it is seriously lacking."
5,Thanks for the memories,"Bob Hope was never a great favorite of mine. And this though like every American movie- going and later television- watching child of my time I spent a lot of time watching him fool around with Bing and Dotty Lamour. Bob was a bit of a wise- guy and a bit cold somehow. He lacked the warmth of favorites like Uncle Miltie and Jack Benny and Amos and Andy.But as the years went by I began to appreciate him a bit more. And this especially when he became much older and became almost the sole survivor of a whole generation of American comedians.This joke- book compiled by his daughter gives jokes, decade by decade, ten chapters for ten decades of his one- hundred year old life.While there is not much laughing out-loud material there are quite a few smiles to be gotten out of this collection.There is also the story of a self- made hardworking kid who really made it big in America and appreciated it very much. And did work hard to give it back.Thanks for the memories, Mr. Hope."
3,"Not photographic paper, but great card stock","I was disappointed with this paper's quality, particularly when compared to the superb quality of Epson's glossy photographic paper. This paper does not produce realistic pictures at all.Usage: While not necessarily a superb choice for matte photos, this paper does work wonderfully for printing desktop publishing documents (such as greeting cards, calendars, brochures, and other items printed on card stock).Quality: It's consistency doesn't really offer a matte photograph appearance, even though the glossy paper from Epson DOES offer a glossy appearance.Color: I've noticed that some packages are off-white, slightly tan/beige/yellow rather than white. It's kind of hit-or-miss as to whether you get the white or the off-colored paper. I've gotten the off-colored paper 2 out of 7 purchases.(I use the Stylus Photo 870 to print)"
1,Erroneous description,"I found this paper on Amazon as an accessory to the Olympus Camedia P-400 Printer. This paper does NOT fit the P-400 because this paper is TOO wide. Thus, with the P-400, this paper is useless."
5,"non glare, heavy paper","I use this medium for paper model building, just design building on computer, print on matte paper, cut out, and glue to thin balsa wood.Then I glue walls together, cut out window openings and doors, add lighting, details,building signs, Then for the inside details. I google wallpaper samples, carpet, picture frame for the walls, and glue to balsa interior walls. It is heavy enough to withstand the rigors of constant handling, different glue types, chalking for aging, and yes, even painting over with latex or enamel paints. I use finished 1930 type buildings for HO railroad layout."
5,Clear Prints,"I use this paper to print out the original copies of my association newsletter. It makes VERY clear original prints, which then are used to make color copies for our members. Much better than printing on regular inkjet paper. Also, I use it for printing pictures taken in the classroom. The students can cut and mount their pictures when doing writing projects."
4,The BEST,"I've used this paper for 3 years now and it has NEVER let me down. I've used it on Epson Photo printer and now my Canon S800 printer and have wonderful, truly photograpic results with it. I use it to print wedding pictures for a photographer when I retouch or take digital photos for her and she is NEVER disappointed. Wonderful paper!"
3,Not quite what I was expecting,"My main complaint about this paper is that it is difficult to tell which is the printable side. My other disappointment is that it didn't make the final copies look any better than my regular printer paper. In fact, several of the final framed prints are regular printer paper, and you can't tell the difference."
4,Great CD but kinda short on songs,"Id say this is a great CD to buy, love the songs, although it only comes with 8 tracks. Overall though its not too bad for the price but could have a little more songs on it :)"
2,So much potential,"Yet not enough substance.Jake and Jasmine had the potential to be a great story. It had the premise for depth and complexity. But the story was not a fluid one and the romance betwen the main characters developed over night and literally in one page. In one breath Jake makes his intention known, and then the next you've realized the story has progressed a couple of months and love is being spoken about. All this without any detail of what transpired or how. There simply is no plausibility here.I was disappointed with the lack of development and really in depth writing. I didn't come away knowing the characters any better at the end of the book then when I read the first page.Again, great potential, but potential not realized sadly."
2,Not enough time,"Jake and Jasmine could have been a really good story if the two were allowed to grow into their love for each other a little more or have more involved with each other. But Jake fell for Jasmine instantly without any real reason or understanding. After the first time he sees Jasmine Jake is in love with her.I wanted this book to go into so much for depth and detail, but it didn't do it. I wanted to give it more than two stars, however I can't."
4,My First Interracial Novel,"In February 2005, was the first time I tried interracial dating. From then on, I went on researching everything about interracial subjects, movies, etc. and came across books. TO tell the truth I never thought books like these existed.N-E wayz, this was the first interracial book I read and I was satisfied. ANd I liked how the author used music to bring the book to life. It was exciting"
3,"3.5. Good, but one flaw in just could not overlook","I am always leary of time travel\body switching as a premise in historical novels. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. I really enjoyed the book, and found it didn't bother me much to never the why or how. Unfortunately, there is one aspect I just could not get over. I finished the book and thought, ""When did they fall in love?"". The heroine's and heroine spent almost no time together, and for most of the time they were together, he hated her because he believed she was his cheating spouse. I just couldn't accept it. I don't regret reading it, but it could have been my favorite Elizabeth Chater if she hadn't rushed the romance. I find Chater's work terribly uneven. In my opinion she is not in the same league as Georgette Heyer or even Joan Smith.Bottom line: Great story. Good read...left unsatisfied at the end because the characters fell in love after having almost no interaction."
5,Wish I could change my review to ONE STAR!,"I initially loved this booklight, and posted a positive review. I posted too soon...after six months of constant use, I am amending my review. The clip pops off at least once a night, exposing the battery. The clip has also loosened and won't stay firmly on the page. The amount of light is sufficient to cover a small paperback's page, not a trade paperback or hardcover, and certainly not a magazine. I'm completely fed up and shopping for another--think I'm going to go with the Phorm Voyager. Stay away from this one!"
1,Why is the battery cover in the FRONT???,"If you look closely at the picture, note that the clip to the book is on top of the battery cover. When you attempt to slide the clip onto the book, the battery cover disengages and the batteries fall out. Then, if you are attempting to read in bed, you'll need to get up, turn on a light, find the batteries, re-install them, put the battery cover in again and oh-so-carefully re-attach it to the book, turn off the light, go to bed, calm down and read. I've been there and done it. The light is bright, adjustable, but is better used as an extremely compact flashlight."
1,I won't buy another,My book light broke after less than 3 weeks.Emails to Amazon & Fulcrum went unanswered.
1,Terrible,"How can you possibly give this book light a good rating? I am extremely dissatisfied with this order. The light is a sickening surgical fluorescent and doesn't put forth enough light to reach the bottom third of the page of a book. In addition, when I pull the light out of the book, the clip stays on the book and the body comes off, leaving the battery cartridge exposed. Fortunately, the inexpensive price of the product reflects the inferior quality."
3,Light light,Weighs almost nothing and provides enough light to read. I own two lightwedges and they are far more reader friendly.....but heavier. I am going on a two week Germany/Austria trip and will take the Fulcrum because I am traveling light (weight) and won't have a lot of time to read.
3,back falls off,"I like the amount of light that the bulb puts off, but that is it. The light is bulky on the book, and when I remove it from the book, the battery cover becomes removed and stays on the book."
4,Awesome Little Light!,"Although a little ""wambly"", this light makes reading before bed easy. Keeping my nightstand light on to read before I go to sleep was not an option as it bothered my husband. This light is very bright (even when on the dimmed setting), but when clipped on and focused on my page, does not keep my husband awake. I say it's ""wambly"" because it's so lightweight - if you need something sturdy, don't buy this light. If you need something that folds flat for travel or lack of clutter on your nightstand, is easy to clip/unclip, and has excellent brightness for reading, then this is your light!"
1,Pushing others newsletters/books,"I felt all this book offered were names, addresses, telephone numbers of other writers. This book didn't supply any means of saving money, only what newletter to purchase ($), what book to purchase ($). Nothing was beneficial and I am very glad I purchased this as a used item and not new."
3,Great for getting backstory,"I've been interested in the Dead Space game series for a while, but haven't been able to justify purchase just yet. I figured seeing the prequel film would help. I wasn't aware it was old-school animation at first (I assumed a 3D CGI game would have a 3D CGI movie ... totally wrong there).The story definitely helps to set the stage for the game, but the animation style is far short of what I'd expect for a film based on a graphic-intensive game. The dialog of the movie also leaves much to be desired.So overall, 3 stars. The movie was helpful for understanding the game, but not to impressive otherwise."
4,Dead Space: Downfall,"While, the animation is pretty cool; however, I expected this animated movie to be creepy and scary like Dead Space 1. It was enjoyable, but not very scary or suspenseful."
3,Dead Space DownFall kinda fell down. :-(,It was just okay. Not enough real information to be anything more that a chapter in the Dead Space overall story.
1,Lots of blood does not make a good movie,"Very generic animation movie - the prequel to the videogame. Silly thing is they've taken 70min of animation that could've been easily been summed up into 5min FMV. A ship collects a mysterious statue from a planet, the people who were sent onto the planet get infected, the spacecraft goes back to the main ship and everybody gets infected or turned into a monster.There's only really one type of monster too, the ones who look exactly like humans but have pointy arms and legs (guts may be spilling out). The animation on the creatures is repetitive, the backgrounds don't really work too well with the characters (lack of detail), the characters aren't interesting aside from using the f word every 5 seconds and the storyline goes nowhere*1/2May be worth watching if you're intending to play the game but I'd stick with a rental"
3,"Hmm, HM style?","Only watched the first 2 minutes (the free minutes, hehe)Seems like the type for us Heavy Metal fans. Will have to rentto find out."
2,Not a full movie in the normal sense,This movie is really a prequel to the Video game--and only that. It's entertaining for the first 20 minutes-- but then it devolves into moving Shoot'em up sequences with occasional videogame type dialogue and then ends.That's it-- it ends. If you want to see or know more-- you will have to play the game. An aborted Storyline with No answered questions.The concept looked like a novel space-horror flick that I was hoping would be a full-fledged animated feature. This was a disappointment. Not worth the $20.
2,Very poorly done...,"As a prequel to a video game it works fine, as a piece of entertainment on its own? No. The animation is nicely drawn but very poorly animated. There is no story beyond ""monster in a box"" and nothing is explained. I guess they leave that for the game."
2,dead space,it was an ok movie ...but it dont come with cheat codes.has anyone else realized this yet?
5,Mission Accomplished,"I was eager to watch this when I heard of Dead Space. I'm very impressed when cross media franchises are done well, and the thought that this was the prequel to the game made me very curious as to how it would perform. It did a perfect job of making my mouth water with anticipation. The story was well done, the soundtrack is effective, and the atmosphere provides just the right amount of creep factor to let you know to never let down your guard... Watching this has gotten me more than ready to plug in the game!"
1,Sent wrong dvd,Bought this dvd for my boyfriend after watching the first one. We were very disappointed when we got the movie and it was the one we just watched.
1,Where is the relation?,"I was a huge fan of the Dead Space video game and thought the story line was drawn very well. The graphics were intense along with the creepy suspense that followed you throughout the entire game, which can be very difficult to do with a video game. The prequel on the other hand was a different story. ///SPOILER\\\............It explains that the whole crew is dead but I ALREADY KNEW THAT. It never went off any of the auido logs or the written logs, didn't explain anything and was very poorly drawn. The characters were unbelievable and where were the weapons that were used in the game. I was expecting the prequel also to give background on clarke's girl. That was a very interesting story and would have been great if they included it.///END SPOILER\\\Summation: Get the game, not the movie."
3,A NICE INTRODUCTION TO THE VIDEO GAME,"This is an introductory animated film to those who have yet to play Dead Space 1. There's lots of gore and blood with dialogue and characters ranging from poor to somewhat good. The story focuses on the removal of an alien artifact and the unleashing of a horror that gives you some insights into the video game (which is supposed to be a lot better than this film). I appreciated how they ended the finale with all the characters. Does it make me want to play the video game now? Well, a bit but my lackluster feelings has more to do with having overdosed lately with video games so I'm taking a break. This piece works best with those who want to play the video game or who are into action SciFi. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C minus to C plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; ACTION/HORROR FOCUSES: B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday; OVERALL GRADE: B minus (higher for fans of the video game, I suspect)."
3,It is what it is.,"The animation varies between decent and poor enough to make some of the old GI Joe cartoons blush, and Alissa Vincent's (the main character) character and voice acting can be like fingernails on a blackboard. Also, if you often spot inconsistencies or errors in details, this movie will have a few moments that drive you batty. That being said, this isn't meant to be a critically-acclaimed blockbuster; it is a cinematic prequel to a video game. If you really loved that game and wanted more back story, this is the place to go. Being a fan myself, I enjoyed that it fleshed out some of the details and that I only payed a used price (yay Amazon marketplace).If you LOVE the Dead Space series and absolutely want all of it you can OWN, buy it used if available. If you're just curious, I'm sure you can rent it somewhere."
5,Animated Horror at it's finest!,"This movie is really good. Well thought out story line. Great NON-CGI animation. I have yet to play the game but after seeing this movie I don't see how I can go any longer without. If this is the start of a series, it's about time! Dead Space has it all for those who enjoy gore and plot! I rate this along side classics like Akira and Ghost in the Shell. A must for any anime collection."
3,Blah.. not that great,"I did a full review of this movies actually, but I'm a big fan of anime and this isn't it at all. It's not that great of a movie really, the animation is not good at all, it seems like something that was rushed out to get released in time for the game. The acting is bad overall as well. As the prelude to the Dead Space game it's worth seeing, but don't buy it new, or really just borrow it to see it, it's really not worth having in a collection. It seems like a kids animation with blood and gore thrown in, just not good at all."
3,Cheap knockoff of Extermination PS2,Movie was plodding.Anime was so so.Lots of cursing ...Seen better gore elsewhere ...The ideal is a ripoff of the aforementioned game.Should have just been named DOWNfall ... LOL
4,Go watch it.,"I'm a huge fan of dead space I've read the comics played both game's and now awaiting for dead space 3 which looks amazing anyway I stumble upon this film and I gotta say it was really interesting, bascially this film tell's you the beginning before the event's of Dead Space game any way highly recommend this to any dead space fan if you are interested."
2,Glad I didn't pay for it...,"This movie is not unwatchable...it's just not very good. From a ""movie/storytelling"" standpoint, it has flat characters that aren't worth caring about, terrible dialogue (lots of swearing to appeal to 14 year old boys, I guess?), and kind of crummy animation. I feel like there is a trend for American movie makers to use ""anime"" style artwork as a sort of gimmick, but to loss of good storytelling (""Batman: Gotham Knight"", most of ""The Animatrix"", some others I cannot think of).From a video game fan standpoint, the movie suffers from a lack of relation to the game, and a failure to develop characters we learn about but never meet in-game. Where is Security Officer Temple? That guy was awesome in the audio logs! And Dr Mercer? Surely we could have learned more about him. I could go on, but you get the idea.Don't bother watching this. Just play the game (as my friend told me) ""with the lights off, in your underwear, to make you feel vulnerable""."
2,Downfall indeed,"Silly me, I thought it was a movie and not one long advertisement for a video game.A bare ghost of an idea stretched to 74 minutes (it felt longer). Very little information was imparted; there was a lot of cartoon blood, no attempt to make it scary, characters that left no impression, meaning this failed on almost every level. It also brought up a very good question: when is a movie not a movie? Dead Space: Downfall."
2,Mediocre if that,"I saw this and it was $13 so I thought I'd take a gamble, should have saved my $13.Acting - BadScript - Juvenal at best, Sesame Street and Mr. Rogers have better scriptsAnimation - Not badDirector - Ed Wood probably could of done a better jobI'll keep it for those times when I'm with a group of friends and wanna get a buzz and make fun of bad movies."
3,it was on ok movie,Ilove the game deadspace but the movie was just ok. yes it shows how the ishamura eventually was overwhemled with te alien species but honestly any attacment to any characters is quickly cut cold turkey when everyone kicked the bucket. all in all i would only recommend to hardcore deadspace fans.
3,Cliche Animated Horror Movie set in Space with Guns Against the Undead,"This is the animated horror movie prequil to the video game. The movie tells a good story about an artifact being found on an alien planet and a necromorphic virus that mutates the dead. There are memorable moments and characters, (mostly because of hair colors and hairstyles). The downside is the animation, which seemed rushed and cheap (reminded me of Aeon Flux). Its animated horror, but nothing is scary, due to the sleek artwork that is brightly lit even in a near dark room. There is a lot of blood, gore and self mutilation. The animated web comic was actually better, scarier, had better art, better voice acting and told the same story."
4,Good movie.,"When I first saw previews for the movie, I thought that it was going to be an anime for some odd reason. Although it wasn't, it's still a good movie and gives you an idea of what happened before the events of Dead Space. Although I won't say too much about the plot for fear of spoiling it, Isaac's girlfriend Nicole does make a brief appearance in this movie."
2,broken after 2 months,Not very well made broke after 2 months of use on the truck. OEM one lasted 6 years.
4,If you have ever been there,Have you ever been in a situation wher you had to get in on the passenger side? Im a big guy. 6ft 200lbs. So in a Toyota... It sucks. Well this saved me a lot of touble and maybe ripped pants. At the time of writing this review I have been using the handle for about 6 months. Its still preforming as well as the day I installed it. even after several midwest freezes. Good product in my book.
2,repetitivo,"Las liricas es lo unico que vas a encontrar diferente de cancion a cancion. Los metales suenan igual, el piano igual, el bajo igual, etc.Cada cancion individualmente es una cancion chevere y el estilo es muy bueno, pero la combinacion de las quince es imposible y ridiculo. Mas variacion es necesaria y porque no hicieron un intento de variar su ritmo no importa que buena sea una cancion que saquen en la radio nunca comprare un disco de ellos."
4,from out of nowhere!,"This CD came from out of nowhere, and has gotten better with every listening. It's been awhile since Quannum has released a new album, let alone new talent, and this one is hot. It builds to a fervor when the guest appearances start popping up, the best being See That with Mr. Lif killin' it as usual. The sound is unique, blending glitch and techno effects with hip-hop beats. It's hard to define, just check it out."
4,Those Darwin awards stories aren't anything new...,"The trend during the last few years towards stories about stupid people brought us such non-classics (but entertaining reads) as ""The 776 Stupidest Things Ever Said"", ""The Darwin Awards"", and others. But what few people know is that such stories were circulating 1000 years ago in the Sufi storytelling tradition.These stories are the equivalent of our ""Urban Legends"". Oddly enough, as I read this, I wish that I could view the world in such simple ways as the Mulla Nasrudin, who is the character in all these stories. His views, often twisted, very often completely at odds with his surroundings, are also very pragmatic, and make perfect sense in his mind.These stories are tremendous fun, and rather thought-provoking.Enjoy!"
1,Fried,This product overheated or shorted out during it's first use producing enough heat to cause the housing to melt.
2,CD Jesse Esteban,The CD is poor quality. The sound is very low. You have to turn the volume way up in order for it to sound close to normal.
3,not like before,"this album is good but not that good the reason being that jossie esteban's style of singing changed .is good but you can not compare this album with none of the album before ""en accion"" cus of lyrics and music playing."
5,Life Appreciation 101 - taught by Prof. Dan Price,"Dan Price has his act together. He appreciates the things in life that have true value - and praises those things with his words, drawings and photographs. Read this book today, ... His books have a way of kicking our high-speed lives back down into first gear where we can appreciate the journey a little more."
4,good strap o.k. price.,this is a good strap but over priced.the bullets are great!they fell great!you could get a strap just as strong for half the priceover all a good strap.
2,How many sheets?,It would be nice to know how many sheets are in a pack. It appears this is an old style of paper.
1,Did A Little Test..,"I had heard that this paper faded when left out in the air so I tested it in my office. Within 1 month it was very yellow. I love the Epson Stylus Photo printers and the Heavyweight matte paper, but if you are exposing your prints to light even under a frame, I would not buy this paper."
5,The Best Photo Paper,"I have been taking digital pictures for several years now and have tried dozens of kinds of paper and NONE do the job like the Epson Premium Glossy Paper. You can not tell by looking that the picture was not printed by a professional. You may pay a little more for Epson but it is worth it, why take a fantastic picture and print it and be disappointed. I highly recommend spending the extra money and using the best. Anytime I try another brand I end up throwing the photo away."
5,Fantastic fun for felines,"Don't let the 'some assembly' worry you: the unit arrives in 90% assembled condition, just two small additions to attach and that took a klutz like me all of 10 minutes. Looks great. My nervous kitty was sitting on it in less than a day, and she is a bit paranoid about anything new. I've not been disappointed by anything I've bought from this company. All well constructed, shipped in reasonable time, and my cats enjoy."
1,"Awful, Simplistic","Sleeper's book reads like he was hit on the head way too hard (a neo-conservative is a white liberal who has been mugged?). Sleeper confuses reactionary liberal arts-influenced liberalism with genuine concern for humanity. In other words, if you are a white who continually has to be educated that blacks - gee! - are just as human as you are - you will fall into Sleeper's world view. True liberals are beyond party politics and clearly Sleeper was never one of them. May this be Sleeper's final book and may be be drummed out of journalism forever!"
5,EVERY PICTURE TELLS THE STORY,"Ed and Kathy-Jo's new book on cottages in the great lakes region goes far beyond your typical Martha Stewart's guide to home living. While it does present you with all the charm and beauty of cottage life, Ed's photography combined with Kathy-Jo's short stories work fluidly together to unravel why having such a place is so important to us. If you are unfortunate, like myself and don't have such a place, this book will make you feel as though you do."
5,A specialty title recommended for those who love cottages,"The Great Lakes Cottage Book is a specialty title recommended for those who love cottages and Minnesota. The authors present fine photos and recollections of Great Lakes cottages and scenes, focussing on subjects which reveal the cottage experience. The result is a coffee table book celebrating a special place and structure."
5,a unique little gem of a book,"If it is true that good things come in small packages, then Channy Lyons has produced a precious gem in her latest book, Verda and Me.Verda is Channy's grandmother, an artist who shared her concept of art in everyday life with her granddaughter. In her book, Channy is showing us how to speak to the artist inside all of us, to take note of what is around us in nature and the environment, and to share that with someone we love.So, if you are a grandmother, a granddaughter or son, or aunt or uncle -- even a Big Brother or Sister, Verda and Me will delight you. You will revel in the world around you and explore it in small and large ways, in big and little detail. Channy has taken the rich texture of her experiences with her grandmother and her discovery of mixing art and nature, and she has passed them on to us. By Susan Hall Killion"
1,Safety and Reactive Maintenance,Short article. Mimimal detail. Don't waste your money. The same information is available on line for free. Amazon should be ashamed for charging for this material.
4,This book is a stunning example of the origins of creativity,"Annie Dillard was recommended to me as a poet whose work would gracefully cross over the line separating genres of literature. I found ""Mornings Like This"" to be much more than this. It has been said many times that there are no more original thoughts left to be expressed. Ms. Dillard challenges this, by presenting us with ""found poetry"" - thoughts that she did not formulate originally but that she has adapted to show deeper or alternate meaning. It IS original, despite being thought of by others first. The work is a delicate web of whimsy"
5,Creativity at its best,"What a wonderful little book of poems! Whether you are familiar with Dillard or not, familiar with the original lines she ""lifted"" or not, or familiar with poetry at all, you will truly enjoy this book. Annie has crafted these found poems in ways that suprise and stimulate, mixing the clever and the humorous with the deep and profound. Each one is a treasure to be explored for again and again. Dillard makes these works her own; you can hear her voice through others' words."
5,Found Poems - A real Gem!,"Anne Dillard is a rare treasure. I loved her poetry in ""Tickets For a Prayer Wheel"" and have searched for more of her poetry for years. Well, this is it. In ""Mornings Like This"" she combs through old books and gathers sentences and phrases then assembles these ""bits of broken text"" into poems that brilliantly illuminate their source material. And what sources she has found! From works such as M. G. Minnaert's ""The Nature of Light and Colour in the Open Air"" - 1893, to D. C. Beard's ""The American Boys Handy Book"" - 1882, and David Greyson's ""The Countryman's Year"" - 1936 (from which she has assembled the poem ""Mornings Like This"") she has searched out and ""found"" words for nearly 40 poems. Oh, this work is a thing of beauty!I have given this book to three friends and shared it with many more, and everyone has been, without exception, delighted with it."
1,Found should get lost,"I was very disappointed in this ""poetry"". I am sorry there is no 0 stars rating."
5,Never is late to learn,"The most important in this book is that you can find anything about sound. I mean 1) fundamentals in sound 2) technology from past to future and 3) aplications. This book speaks of any thing in sound for any aplication (TV, studios, acoustic ect)"
5,Sound God,I have had Stanley Alten for a professor and he knows what he is talking about. He is the know-all be-all of sound. His books are easy to read and to understand and great for people learning sound techniques.
4,Has the piece I want,"The Stokowski version of Harrison's Concerto for violin, piano and small orchestra has long been a favorite of mine. It sounds a whole lot better than my scratchy old vinyl and thanks to this reissue, I've got it on my iPod. Remember this is a burned disc, so handle with care and back it up. Yes, it's listed as stereo, but only some tracks are. The one in question is in its original glorious mono. If you love this music, this is a must have cd."
2,Terrible acting,"I loved the story line but the acting was horrible. ""Sage"" was terrible. The director must've went to the streets and grabbed anyone walking by."
3,Movie Treacherous,"This movie is okay for those days of just lying around and not doing anything. It has a good story line. But, it won't know your socks off. I would recommend it though."
2,Beware of terrible sound,"This is a frustrating collection of studio outtakes, rehearsal takes, and live stuff. It's frustrating because, for the most part, the sound is terrible. Muddy, unbalanced, with some instruments and vocals buried in the mix and some way out front. There are still some OK cuts, and the power of Iggy and the Stooges is still present, but unfortunately it just leaves you wanting more!"
2,To the Bonfires!,Art for art teachers and students that what to become art teacher.WE only has to look through a book like this to realize how incomprehensible modern art has become.Eat and defecate in your own kitchen. I bought this book hoping to get an insight into what is going on in the west as ideas or feelings represented by symbolism.This University art tell nothing except doubt and decadence.This art is symptomatic of the left wing psychology.No stoicism here.You must not resist in your apology.There cousins in politics (& there media controllers) are still using the police state to close down any debate that is not politically correct.Back to the USSR.Only the victim is sacrosanct but who deems the victim?!!Basically more post modernist h.s. .To the bonfires!2 stars for those who try.
5,Amazing!!!!! From track 1 to 14,"Every song on here is amazing and sang with so much Heart and Emotion. I can't remember how many times i have listened to it i lost count. I highley reccomend this to anyone who loves and enjoys music country or non. Billy Ray has a amzing voice and is very talented. If you have not heard a Billy Ray cd in a while you are missing out he has been putting out amazing music going way back to 1992 and has really evolved over the years you owe it to yourself to give this very uplifting Home at last cd a shot i don't think you will be disapointed. Nothing short of amazing also check out his long list of other albums here on amazon especially Wanna Be Your Joe, The Other Side and Time Flies the more recent albums in the last few years. And this is the re-release of Home At last where they inclued the Duet with his daughter miley which they sang on Dancing With The Stars. Which is track 14"
1,Nice monitor but I'd never buy ViewSonic again,"My ViewSonic monitor was excellent for nearly a year - a nice crisp bright picture. Then the screen started jumping in and out. They shipped me a replacement within 24 hours and I was impressed - until I opened the box. The unit had clearly been dropped on to a hard surface. The case was cracked and it blew up when I applied the power. Note that this hadn't happened in transit because the packing was still in perfect condition. So someone at ViewSonic had deliberately sent be a badly damaged monitor.I got another replacement 4 days later. No damage this time, but it didn't work either. I'm waiting for the phone lines to open to request another.Now what sort of company sends out replacement units that are clearly dead? One that doesn't care much about its customers for sure. Even if I do eventually get a replacement that works, I won't be buying from ViewSonic ever again."
1,Please spend more money for SONY,"I recommend this monitor to 2 friends before. But three months after I bought it, the left bottom corner lost the blue color. When set refresh rate higher than 60Hz. It starts to blinking for 3 seconds every half an hour.Anyway, I will buy SONY next time."
1,Bad choice,"Although this monitor has a good picture and is priced fairly, you should think twice about purchasing a Viewsonic. Their customer service is atrocious and this is important because it will be needed if your experience is like mine: Your monitor turns itself off and degausses itself. you'll be on hold 45 minutes and pay $50 to have another shipped to you, which arrives and is ""refurbished"". Your ""refurbished"" monitor will stop waking up from sleep mode after a month or so. You'll wish you'd spent the extra $20 and got that Sony. This monitor is the Fiat of displays. You should buy two, as you'll be needing a backup."
2,Jumbled,"The book is not straight forward. Instead of teaching the basic concepts and then moving on to a more detailed analysis, the author first complains about all of the problems about this or that license. Then, in the process, you get only bits of basic information. It's a jumbled mess.The editor really let the author down. It's the editor's job to make sure the information is edited to be clear and logical.If you need to learn about open source licensing, watch the FREE training videos from Black Duck Software. Just Google ""black duck webinars"". I believe the author of this book is involved in those as well.I've found other open source licensing books that get high ratings on Amazon, but none of those are very good either. Well written books on open source licensing seem to be hard to find."
4,Dragonball GT Season 2,It is good to complete the saga. But you will probably only watch it once or twice. So buy it cheap or rent it.
4,GT,"It's not as good as DBZ or DB, but it's still really solid if a little sillier than it needs to be."
5,OK,lo que mejor que ha sucedio lastima que funimation compleeto el volumen 1 y 2.recomendaria que sacarna en sub en español y si pueden el idioma español latino para todos los hisapanoamericanos eso saldira como pan calientito
5,More information,"Sibelius, Jean (1865-1957) Tempest (The), suites (2), Op. 109Sitkovetsky, Dmitry (vln)performed with Marriner/Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. Nos. 1 & 3 +Violin Conc. in d, Op. 47"
4,Paper great; Curls Not great,"This is great paper for printing 4x6 pictures. I used it on my 785EPX and also on my 825. You can't tell the difference between photolab & the printed one. The quality is EXCELLENT. Unfortunately, you can't get the pictures to lie flat no matter what you do. I've laid heavy books on the pictures and the still pop-up. It's easier to use Epson 4 X 6 Borderless Photo Paper, same quality, but the pictures are flat."
4,I love this paper,"This paper makes your photos look great - especially when printed on an Epson 875 DCS printer! Noone can believe that my prints came from my house - not the developer. My only complaints are that sometimes the paper is hard to feed in to the printer and that it is still rounded after printer. I have solved this by wrapping the paper the opposite direction after the ink is dry and my photos are much less rounded. Otherwise, I would have rated this a perfect 5 stars!"
2,Paper curl,"Great paper. Convenient to print large numbers of prints. But, it comes off the roll curved and no amount of effort can straighten it. Wish it were not so."
5,"Brilliant pictures, lively colors","These are premium glossy photo papers; The ink dries instantly the picture colors and quality match regular 35mm prints. Don't settle for less; recently I purchase low quality Kodak high gloss paper, the price is less 200 4x6 sheets for $[money], but the results are disastrous. The ink smudges because it does not dry as quickly, and the surface is sticky, you can not insert it into the photo album's clear plastic envelopes, and the pictures are grainy not as smooth as epsons photo paper."
4,Great stuff but too much curl,"This product produces wonderful, lab-like 4x6 photos, but there is a curl that cannot be overcome. You'll need a good quality paper cutter to separate the pictures, but this is no problem."
1,Sure it is fun to use but this paper yellowed after 1 month!,I put this paper on the wall in my office next to a picture printer on Epson Heavyweight matte paper and the glossy roll picture was yellow in a little over a month. I will never buy this paper again.
5,"4"" roll - photo paper by Epson","First of all very nicely packed, reusable box. Absolutely the same quality as the photo paper in sheets. Easy to use. Excellent printout quality. A little minus, prints tend to keep its original shape, roll. Takes time to flatten 'em. After all they come in the roll. Overall - I'm very satisfied. *****"
5,Great for volume holiday printing.,"Since my printer (and the software) allows roll printing I finally got the roll paper to try it and it is really great when printing many photos as you often do for the holidays. This supplier provided the roll at an economical price, making it a good deal all around."
2,Don't buy or use this paper,I have recently purchase the epson 890 injet printer and was trying out the included roll of premium glossy paper. The paper gets jam easily and photos comes out with streaks. I will definitely go for the regular 4X6 paper instead of the roll paper.
5,VOLBEAT: Best band out there right now...,"I know this came a few years back but this dvd is massive. What a great band. Yea the camera jumps around a bit too much on the outdoor portion of the dvd, but the rest of it is well worth the $$$. I saw them live this year and yes this will hold me over until they come back around."
5,Tape to Use With Pollington's Old English Reader,"This is a great tape that goes along with Pollington's reader, but not so great as a stand alone item. I give it five stars with the book, but only three stars with out the book.Wyatt Kaldenberg"
4,good,"I am happy it didn't change my hair color into red like most hair products do. It did, however, had a hard time covering my gray. Next time I will keep it on longer than the instructions sugest."
5,...,"I have always loved the movie and now I love the book. Great insight on every page. I have several other books on Wonderful Life. ...This one is now my favorite. I learned so much new information the other books didn't include. It is impressive in design and content. Everything Wonderful~ Down to the last cornflake! MANY great photos. A COLOR section! If you're a fan of the film like me, (and who's not-?) this is the book for you. HEE HAW!! Very exciting new information on the cast and making of. Did you know Snow White sings-? Yes, and how. Read all about Adriana Caselotti (Voice of Disney's Snow White.) I never knew her voice was heard in my favorite movie; in my favorite scene. (Also Jimmy's.) Such a treat and full of Life's Wonderful Surprises. ... I'm getting a nice batch for family and friends. My holiday shopping is over! HEE HAW!! How 'bout yours-? A beautiful book from cover to cover. HOT DOG!!"
2,Great bbs there black,the worst compony iv ever had too deal with they cancled my order two times then finaly got it rite. great to use w/ full auto guns
5,B Is For BEST EVER,"Can't believe that these were ""leftover"" songs from the recording sessions for Anthem. This is my favorite LTJ CD, and I play it endlessly."
3,not great,"Less Than Jake without horns are just like any typical pop-punk band. With the horns they are fantastic and never boring. I don't understand why LTJ abandoned their ska-influenced punk for pop-punk that has nothing that distiguishes it from any other of the pop-punk bands that are arising in great numbers. Pez Core, Losing Streak, Hello Rockview, and even Borders and Boundaries are classics that i can listen to even to this day and never become bored. The horns, the upbeat jumpiness of the music is great. Anthem was just plain boring. This album is better than Anthem but still lacks the ska and the horns the made LTJ so much fun to listen to. The few times the horn section is used they sound dead, it's really sad. So Vinnie, the brains behind LTJ, bring back the ska,horns, and the fun to LTJ that made your band different from anything i'd heard; and more fun!"
3,eh...it's alright,"Less Than Jake is definetly a ska legend, it's just disappointing to see them discarding the style of music that they have been playing so well. Now it seems they're trying to cater to the mainstream audience as opposed to their loyal fans. I'm not saying that the songs suck, because they don't. I just want to buy a less than jake album because of the content, not because of the name of the band. A.S.A.O.K is the best song on this cd, with a decently catchy horn line. Most of the songs I could do without. Don't buy this if you don't have Losing Streak, Pezcore, or Hello Rockview, as those are LTJ's best work. Here's to hoping that LTJ goes back to their old style of ska."
3,Ehhh ok,"""B for B-sides"" just like ""Anthem"" is very mediocre Less Than Jake. Just like ""Anthem"" the horn section has all but disappeared. When horns are used they are very weak. Less Than Jake without the horn section is just any ordinary pop-punk band with nothing to set them apart from the pack. The horn section made them lively and jumpy and fun to listen to. Hey Vinnie, I know you are the brains behind LTJ, bring back the horn section and the great jumpy guitars! ""Anthem"" was just plain boring after a few listens and i assume this will be too. ""Pez Core"" ""Losing Streak"" ""Hello Rockview"" and even ""Borders and Boundaries"" are timeless. I can listen to those for years over and over. Bring back the horns and fun to Less Than Jake because otherwise you are just a mediocre pop-punk band. I love Less Than Jake, but I'm just being honest here. My fav LTJ song is ""Scot Farcus Takes It In The Chin"" now that is a fun song."
3,too short,"yeah, I know its a b-side comp, but still, a little warning please! only 28 mintues?! at least include some more songs, even if they're just acoustic or other versions of the same tracks already on there!"
2,As A Less Than Jake Fan..,"I found this CD rather dissapointing. There are maybe 2 good songs. ' Goodbye in Gasoline ' and ' Portrait of a cigarette smoker at age 19 ' .. Or something alone those lines. Maybe if I go back to this CD I will like it more, but i wouldn't recommend this song to anybody unless they are finding something new.<sorry LTJ>"
1,I miss old school LTJ,"Less Than Jake, from my point of view, changed their style of music completely so that they will sell more albums. For whatever reason, people like to hear distorted guritars with a syncrnized bass, and a fast drum beat(as in this album)...mabe LTJ wasn't happy being an underground band...What they play ""now"", and what you consider ""ska"" is not ska. Hello Rockveiew, Losing Streak, now thats ska. it's not just the horns that categorizes a ska band!!!I miss old school LTJ!!!"
2,Not the best.,The Exam Cram series is always a gamble. Most of them are winners; this one is a sure loser.The Exam Cram strength has always been to cover the material MS requires on test. The first few chapters provide a good introduction to clustering and then the book covers the appropriate topics. Just not in the proper depth or clarity needed to pass the test. Add to this shortcoming the constant misspellings and worthless pratices tests and you lose.Maybe this book will work if you have experience with MS Clustering and you just need to fill one or two gaps.
4,My favorite childhood book,"My mom often said, ""If only I had a nickel for every time I read this book to you!"" A fun story about eccentric Granny and the day she finds a baby hanging in a tree in the woods, along with a big gray ""dog"". She carts them both home and the fun begins!"
3,Nice,"I just bought it becouse I need princess costume in the middle of summer and that is a problem to find anything in store. Nice, but during Halloween season you can find way better."
3,Daughter's wand,"Wand was a lot of fun for my 4-year old daughter for Halloween. It has held up with her playing with it. It does have small parts that could break off easily if it were handled more roughly. I would not recommend it for someone younger, but for her it was a perfect addition to her ""princess"" costume."
1,Horrible,"I think Leo is cute and all that, but to actually devote an entire picture book to this higly arrogant and pretentious star is sinful. More importantly, its boring.This book is rather comprehensive, of course, except that its pre-'The Beach'. So we get to see lots of Leo in his Titanic hey-day, looking as swollen as a goose. Thankfully, there are no nude shots of this actor. Anyone whos seen 'The Beach' knows the body that Leo has and not many people are interested in it, I understand. I for one, am not.In any case, if Leo is your cup of tea, visit a bookstore and flick through this, but for heaven's sake don't buy it! Not at all recommended."
5,Excelente historia de navidad,"Una Navidad en la que la práctica de la virtud es el camino ideal al que debemos dirigirnos, a pesar de los tragos amargos.Perseverar en este principio vale la pena."
5,Spectacular Scent,"This is my first Burberry perfume. My aunt got me turned on to Burberry, with the Burberry plaid line. I love this scent, it's not fruity, it's lighter and less overpowering than its original scents. Got it for a great deal for under $40."
5,Wish they still made this!,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this fragrance, but its so hard to find. Please bring back Burberry!! Pretty pretty please. Yum"
5,"Wonderful, sensual scent!!","This perfume is absolutely wonderful. It is difficult for me to find perfumes that I am able to wear, must wear French or British scents. Found this in EPCOT, in the United Kingdom area. The scent stays with you and will not turn, even if you have an acid factor in your skin. Wonderful, worth the price!!"
3,An indepth intro to islands on Florida's Gulf Coast,"An indepth introduction to the major barrier islands on Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast. Good backgrounder for planning and enjoying daytrips, weekends, or longer trips to these varied barrier islands. From the Panhandle in the North to the Everglades in the South.Information presented includes history, local attractions, interesting stories and antidotes. Specific resturants, resorts, and stores are often mentioned, together with address and phone information.I was pleased to find I agreed with the author's description and evalutions for many of the islands I am familiar with. I also learned several new things I wished I had know before my visits."
1,Nothing new,"Save your money.The DVD contains 3 songs from the Whiskey concert, and 3 from the Device Voice Drum concert. The DVD also contains remastered Dust in the Wind on and Hold on (audio only).The CD also has Dust inthe Wind and Hold on, as if we need to hear them twice in one purchase.If the band can't, or won't, write new material I wish they'd stop greatest hitting their fans to death."
1,OH NO.....HERE WE GO AGAIN,ANOTHER COMPILATION CD....RIDICULOUS....GIVE THE FANS A BREAK...IGNORE THIS AND BUY PROTO KAW INSTEAD...AT LEAST KERRY STILL CARES.
2,Disappointing,"I am very disappointed with Dean King's efforts here. Where is this great prodigy of maps that the book seems to promise? Much of the book is taken up with summaries of PO'B's novels. If I want to know what happened in the books I will read them, I don't need to pay 21 American dollars for that. And most of the content that is not summary is written descriptions entitled 'Here and There'. Can Mr. King possibly think his accounts will succeed in enabling we hopeless lubbers to comprehend intricate harbors and locations where the great O'Brian's have not? In the Post Captain chapter, do we find a map of Chaulieu where Aubrey fights the Polychrest until she sinks under him? No we do not. This book should be filled cover to cover with detailed charts and maps. It falls far and sadly short of expectations. I urge anyone not having been duped into purchasing it already to refrain from doing so."
2,Disappointing at best,"A geographical companion and atlas could be very helpful, but this didn't answer. The maps are inadequate and omit many important and interesting locations. The maps are also rather crudely drawn. The text is unnecessary and silly, attempting to recap each book and at the same time not give away the plot. Perhaps someone else will try their hand and be more successful.I can imagine a book arranged as an atlas, with colored detailed maps which include all named locations. Maps with exploded detail would be necessary to show harbors and navigation hazards. The index would include all place references with location coordinates on the maps. Latitude and longitude references should also be included. I'll buy one as soon as it's published."
3,Don't read until you've finished the books,"This is a good but not great volume. It's full of useful information, but if you purchase and read it before reading all the books, you'll end up knowing how they all end. The only way to proceed is to read each chapter as you finish each book. I found myself covering some of the maps with my hands so I couldn't see where this or that ship gets sunk or engaged."
4,Fine Atlas Chronicling Aubrey/Maturin Adventures,"Dean King's ""Harbors and High Seas"" is a good atlas chronicling the exploits of Captain ""Lucky Jack"" Jack Aubrey and ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin from the fateful meeting in ""Master and Commander"" through ""The Commodore"". The maps - which are drawn by William Clipson - are a fine guide tracing the major routes undertaken by Aubrey's ships (and Maturin's personal espionage missions on behalf of the British government) across the globe. Each chapter corresponds with the O'Brian novel, without giving away much with regards to plot (though the maps themselves offer quite a few spoilers). Admittedly this is a bit expensive to acquire - though hopefully the paperback edition will be much less expensive - but may nonetheless be regarded as an important companion to the O'Brian novels which any diehard fan of Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin may wish to possess."
5,An Excellent Reference Book,"I don't understand why anyone would be disappointed with this book. The first 17 books in the series all have their own chapter, complete with a summary, maps and interesting side notes about the places visited. Many thanks to the author for providing these summaries, because it is easy to get confused the story lines of each book after they have been read. There are plenty of maps to show the places and routes for the first 17 books in the series. I urge anyone wanting more information about Jack Aubrey to buy this book."
2,"Buy it, but don't expect much.","Since it is the only companion book available that charts the Aubrey/Maturin novels, it may be worth buying to follow the voyages. I was left wanting so much more - sketches of the ships, uniforms of the officers and the Foremast Jacks. The included summary of the novels is silly! You might save your money and purchase a good World Atlas along with ""Seamanship in the Age of Sail"" an excellent, if pricey, volume and perhaps the best: ""Nelson's Navy"" which gives great detail of the ships and the Navy of the time. (The Geoff Hunt prints of the cover paintings show some splendid representation of the ships - some are still available.)The Aubrey/Maturin novels deserve fine companion books, not this seemingly slapped together comic-book. I hope that someone out there is working on a version that will live up to the novels of Patrick O'Brien."
4,Excellent companion,"Synopsi of each book; info on all the islands, cities and other places visited, excellent maps. I did want a little more though... more of each type of thing. It's one of those that you would want on your shelf along with other companion books. No 1 book is perfect."
4,An excellent companion to the Aubrey-Martin books,"If you enjoy the Aubrey-Maturin books as I did (and I read almost nothing else for several months), you will find this book an excellent reference aid. At times I found the geography in the books difficult to follow. The maps in Dean King's companion set forth with excellent clarity where Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin have been and when they were there. Although I found Dean King's lexicon (his other book) more helpful, I would nonetheless recommend this one."
5,"A quest for knowledge on where, why and how.","""Harbors and High Seas"" is a must for the reader of the Aubrey/Maturin series. I keep it, along side my reading chair along with Dean King's other book, ""A Sea of Words."" This is the second time I have read the series and the detail gleaned from King's books enhances, not only the pleasure but also the understanding of O'Brian's stories. I highly recommend both books."
1,Can't tell you if it's any good--won't run on Windows XP,"This program repeatedly fails to run on Windows XP Media Center Edition (on a Hyper-Threading chip)--it freezes up, even if I set it up to run in W95 & W98 Compatability modes.Apparently, others have had the same problem, and TOPICS Entertainment (Well, ENCORE, however they're related) has recently acknowledged that it won't run on ANY XP platforms."
1,Crashes constatly,"Impossible to use under Windows XP, since it constantly crashes.Highly NOT recommended."
4,Very enjoyable book - weak ending,"I agree with the other reviewers who enjoyed this book but were disappointed by the ending. It was quite a let-down, actually. This is the first book I have ever read by Jason Starr, but I will definitely read his next one. He is a talented writer who wrote a very suspenseful, engaging book. Hopefully he will do better on the ending next time."
2,Like pulling off a Band-Aid....SPOILER ALERT,"At least it's over fast! This is one of those type stories you come across once in a while where you keep reading because the main character is so dumb, you wonder what he's going to do next. This one doesn't fail in that respect- he does increasingly stupid things far more often as the book progresses. I guess that chronicles his decent into insanity.But the story rings false in a few places. For instance at one point, despite being married for some years, he and his wife settle in to chat about some of their most basic childhood memories. Now, I'm going to guess that most married couples have already shared those memories at some point. Anyhow, there are a few ""Yeah, Right!"" moments in the book, that really detracted from the story."
4,Entertaining noir/crime fiction,"This is a one-sitting page-turner in the tradition of Jim Thompson, though not quite to his standard. Nevertheless, I'll read more of Jason Starr, who thoroughly entertained me with this book ... which readers who lack interest in the dark side of life or find it offensive will NOT enjoy. Very workmanlike. It seems that Starr might be capable of a classic, & he's certainly worth reading for noir fans."
3,pretty good,"There's nothing terrifically ground-breaking about this novel, but at the same time there's a genuine integrity to the writing, as well as a firm grasp of character. The story doesn't so much falter at the end but tip its hand (you'd have to be completely out of it not to see what's coming), and this is forgiveable, if a bit annoying. It's nice to read a book that stays on the tracks as firmly as Starr's does. Check it out."
2,don't waste your time,"As an experienced technical theater engineer, I have never used most of the methodes in this book. Warren seems to be too attached to the old ""wire frame and paper mache"" techniques and hardly ever uses anything else for three dimentional props. Furthermore, there are hardly any common props featured in this book and most of the ones that are featured can be cheaper bought than constructed. There arn't many otherbooks like this out there but any of them would be more helpful."
2,jeet kune do dvd's,"Product was delivered as promised, no problems there.. But video quality is horrible and these dvd's froze in 3 different dvd players that work fine otherwise. In my opinion very overpriced."
4,Great Instruction,"These DVD's are the same videos as what were on the VHS tapes and seem to be a direct recording from those tapes. The information on these DVD's are really good and you can use them as a good reference and instructional for JKD. As with any art, I still recommend going to a qualified instructor, but if you see what Sifu Poteet has done with many of his students like Octavio Quintero, Fran Joseph, Jason Scott Lee, etc. you can see what he teaches is sound. I would highly recommend these DVD's to any JKD practitioner or to anyone who doesn't have an instructor close to them to use to help get them started."
3,curl challenged,I purchased this little curl wand because a friend of mine said it worked far better then a regular eye lash curler. However I don't feel it works as well. It may work better on someone with long lashes.
1,Boring,"This game was so boring that I barely made it to the 30 minute mark. It was one of my worst gaming experiences ever, with the only saving grace being you can turn it off. The controls are unweildy, the graphics are awful, and the dialogue was inane."
5,Avatar The last airbender,I purchased this game for my nephew and he loved it. I recommend this game.
3,This game is boring...,"My son and I love Avatar, so this game was a no-brainer...supposedly. Its very slow paced and clunky. Where's the action man!?"
5,Perfect size for CDs,The quarter inch size is the perfect size for the spines of the CD jewel cases. I use them all of the time to label my CDRs. Good for other small jobs too.
1,One of three failed,"I ordered three of these for my PT-1880 label printer. One failed. It did not eject the tape while printing. I opened the printer and the 3 tapes were balled up (the white, the black, and the clear). I e-mailed Brother on how to get a replacement. They said take it up with the seller! I said they were the manufacturer and they should replace it. I bought another three from Circuit City and one of those failed in exactly the same manner. I sent them both back to Brother demanding replacements as the manufacturer. I also copied the BBB. Nothing heard from Brother but BBB has started a case on it. I would not buy any Brother products in the future as they do not stand behind their products. BTW these tapes are $10 each, not cheap."
3,Brother P-Touch Tape can be cranky,"I purchased this Brother P-Touch tape for an older P-Touch labeler, and the tape jammed. For some reason, the older printer works better with 3/4"" tape, though it is rated for the 1/4"" width, too.I used another new tape in this same label printer, and it broke. I contacted Brother to ask about a replacement, and never heard from them."
2,starts good but then blah blah,starts ok...but does not compare to the lady killer. the writing is horrendous and she repeats the same sentences for different characters...she's only done well on one book
2,"Story is good, writing isn't...","I'm sorry to say this because I sort of enjoyed the story, but this isn't a well-written book. The author's style is clumsy and sort of amateurish. I did find the story interesting (and the TV program based on it is really good) but the book falls rather short of what I think a good book should be. It's also too long and could have used some editing. Not a keeper, unfortunately."
5,Great product! Exactly as we expected.,"This is a great product, exactly as we expected... Definately would recommend it to other people looking for a high quality label."
3,For beginners only,"Pretty much like what you would get for a beginner combo. Casting with the rod feels kind clunky, not much accuracy there. Nothing fancy with the reel, but definitely functions OK. Fly line is not supple enough, and the nail knot between the fly line and leader badly tied(which is not a big deal since you will need to retie it anyway very soon). If you only want to try out fly fishing, it's good enough. If you want to get a bit serious get a better rod."
5,Allison Rules,"Allison is a sportsmanship obsessed man who delivers excellently in ""Hear These Voices."" It's surprising a man like Mr. Allison would write such a book, being the man he is. He hates when anybody curses, but he allowed cursing in his book. When you hear the word competetitive, you don't think of Anthony. However, ""Hear These Voices"" is a work of brilliance from this young, sportsmanship driven man, out of Amagansett, Long Island. TWO THUMBS UP- ROGER EBERTSPORTSMANSHIP AND NON-COMPETETIVENESS IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS"
2,Redeye is AWFUL,"I hate this camera for two reasons!1. Most every image you take of someone's pretty eyes will have some form of redeye, usually pretty bad. Don't think it won't be bad for you, I did and got burned!. The red-eye reduction doesn't help either.2. Focusing/taking the picture doesn't work well. How annoying is this, you focus on the picture (half-press shutter button), camera beeps, saying it is in focus. You proceed to fully press the button and ... nothing! You hold it there for a few seconds and EVENTUALLY it will take the picture. I find this occurs when you take pictures that are not focused on any one particular subject (landscape, parties, etc.)Other bad things which aren't necessarily the cameras fault.-It's tiny, very tiny. Sometimes your thumb will get in the way of the lens, messing up the shot.-No zoom, This gets annoying if you are used to a camera with a zoom, but if you don't mind ""manually zooming"", then go for it."
1,Sony has poor customer service,"I ordered the camera thru Amazon. I love Amazon, they shipped the order to me right away.However, the camera sent to me was missing the battery charger. Until I can charge the batteries, the camera will not work. The battery charger is proprietary to this camera, I cannot buy another charger at the store.Sony customer service is poor. I've called, and emailed to request a replacement immediately. The Sony customer service rep acted as through they were doing me a favor. 3 days later, I still have no replacement, and have a camera which will not work."
3,Works great if it doesn't break,"I've used a lot of this stuff trying to get stuff organized in the house and in my husband's shop. It is great for the most part. However, the last 3 packages have broken about 1/3 of the way through. It is no warning & no repair. So I've had to throw away the package.I did contact the company several times, but have not had any response. Guess I'm just out of luck on getting a replacement for the broken ones."
1,Not Vista compatible,"This is absolutely a beautiful program--when it works. In fact on XP I would give it four stars. The problem is it won't run under many machines loaded with Vista. The company, on their Yahoo group site, makes many recommendations for getting it to work, but it still wouldn't for me on two different laptops. One gave me screwed up graphics and the other an ominous memory dump message.The real problem, I think, is that the program was originally for Macs and they were able to adapt it for Windows 98 & XP, but Vista is a whole different kettle of fish. It has been almost a year since their site said they would have a Vista compatible version ""soon."" I think they removed that message now. Also Amazon should remove the claim that it's runs on the Vista platform.I'm afraid that Imaginova is a long way off from becoming truly Vista compatible. I recommend looking at SkyMap Pro or SkyTools at skyhound.com."
1,No Vista support,"I couldnt even get it to LOAD.. much less run. Apparently Vista dosent even support the installer.I loaded it on my laptop with XP and everything is fune.. but its a bummer I cant run it on my new, fast computer."
5,Great Software But Could Do Much Better With Compatibility,"Great purchase....Has everything that you could possibly need. The Only problem is vista compatibility. The disc i have says its compatible with vista but it did not seem to work well with vista. It works amazing with XP. I would recommend that you run starry night on windows xp(service Pack 2 ) compatibilty mode(If you are using vista). Once you do that, it works great. Its a little slow but it works!Enjoy!....Definitely a good purchase"
1,"Good program, just can't run on Windows 7 and no support","I have had this product for some time, running fine under XP 32 bit. Sometimes it didn't play well with certain graphics adapters like Nvidia GE-Force 6800. However, once I upgrade to Windows 7 64 bit, this program will not install. Checking their website, it also doesn't appear they support the product any longer. Shame too, because it was the most full featured desktop planetarium software I've seen in some time."
4,Worth the read,"Worth the read. a bit repetative on explanation, however the information on Animals was good. There seems to be alot associated with animals and the connection to the nedicine wheel so I have to read more into it, but for beginging it was a good read. If you already have information about thie path, move on to a more advanced book."
5,The Path of the Feather,This is an excellent guide for those wishing to discover their own sacred path. The illustrations are very nice and the chapters are laid out for easy reading and following for newcomers looking to find their own path.
5,Freathers Everywhere!,I love Dr. Michael Samuels books and this one is no exception. It's a great pocket size so it can travel with you all over the world. I would highly recommend it to anyone on the path.
2,please!,"When will this author stick to a subject that he knows-- traditional medicine-- and quit inflicting flowery generalities that capitalize on other people's cultures (in this case, Native Peoples) to sell books? This book is so poorly researched it made my head spin (which is about the only shamanic aspect of it that was validated). I returned it immediately and should have learned with past experiences with this author's work."
4,Frustration and nostalgia in one cartridge.,"Ghost 'N Goblins was one of the few NES games I played which I never finished. It wasnt for a lack of effort, mind you. This game will kick your ass, with cheap tricks at times and it will make you use all of your gamind focus to plow through it. I bought this bastard because I never finished it when I was a kid. I bought it and I have done it. This was my ritual to adulthood. I could hear the gaming gods whispering in my ear ""well done mate"". If you never played it, do it. Its fun and frustrating at the same time."
2,ghosts N goblins,now the only thing bad about this game is thats it's extremely hard get hit two times and then you lose. every time you die it shows the level again just taunting you showing your on such a low level. once you get to the last boss after many trys you beat the boss and guess what it sends you back to the first level so you have to do it all again! after that you get up the last boss again then beat him the endings not good but the only fun thing is that it's a hard so if you want a very hard game then this is for you.
5,Outlets,"The Outlets rock... A once forgotten band now reappears with a great cd. This cd is a powerhouse, a must for the younger crowd that would like to listen to an uptempo sound. The slow songs are very good too and they do a Carpenter's cover as well. I loved it."
2,Not up to standard,"Can't believe the author of the excellent Dr. Rhea novels wrote this! Unlikely premise (paranormal abilities), not particularly likeable or believable charcters, too much gratuitous violence....very disappointed."
2,Not Hunter's Best,"I love Gwen Hunter, but this book had too much melodrama and too much silly dialogue, and the heroine's ""gift"" just didn't ring true to me. I skipped to the end just to see how she resolved the mystery, but the book wasn't compelling enough to read cover to cover after I'd struggled through the first third. If you love a good thriller, try _Shadow Valley_, or any of the Dr. Rhea Lynch series, also by Gwen Hunter. They're all top notch."
2,Not her best work.,"I was somewhat disappointed in this one, and I have enjoyed Hunter's previous writings. Petty as it seems, I was distracted and annoyed with the silliness of the verbiage used by the main character as a substitute for ""cuss words"". I could have read right on through normal profanity and enjoyed the story a little more."
2,Wanted to like it....,"I really wanted to like this book. I like Tyler and her group of friends. Her neice Jane was a really great kid. I have to agree with other reviews that I was a little creeped out by how couples were from the same bloodline.What really let me down was the ending, it made me want to give 2.5 stars instead what was leading up to a 3. The whole book we're caught up in who kidnapped her brother and why. The final kidnapper (who should have had by far the STRONGEST reaction from Tyler) gets a 2 second mention on the second to last page. It was completely ridiculous how to all came together. The first half of the book was pretty good but the author ran out steam and then rushed the whole confusing ending."
1,This one was a real headache....,"While this book has some promising aspects it becomes a tedious grind of events as seen and felt by the very self absorbed heroine Tyler St Claire. Using her gift of second sight causes her headaches ""Pain like a lance of forge hot steel pierced my forehead over my left eye"". The book is littered withwhat are best described as pain and angst paragraphs. Her extreme reaction page to touching Adam Wiccam ""Pain exploded in my head, a ricochet of agony - on and on ending with ""the pain was a caustic, cutting agony boring through my brain"" What will she do when she receives her bothers finger in the box - you may well ask. She is supported in her endeavors by characters far more interesting. I would rewrite this and add more of her brothers perspective and edit out 90% of Tyler's self dialogues."
2,Mostly competent but pretty confusing,"Black does a reasonably good job of selecting relevant content, but reading this book is difficult. There are numerous typos - some of them in crucial diagrams - and the writing style is dense and unclear, often leaving you pondering a sentence for hours because you feel that it's important but have no idea what it means. A much better resource for this subject is Stallings, ""SNMP, SNMPv2, and CMIP: The Practical Guide to Network-Management Standards"". Unfortunately, that is out of print, and I don't know if Stallings has superseded it with any of his numerous other books."
5,Very valuable EM concepts,This book fills a sore need in EM literature... the need for concepts over math. Many EM books and professors unfortunately place math before concepts and thus waste precious time & student motivation.I wish I had this book as a companion textbook back in college.
5,Brilliant introduction and review...,"This book covers a broad swath of E&M in a way that is easily accessible to a practicing engineer (and I suspect many others). No, it won't be a reference ""bible"" on your shelf, but it is the perfect introduction to the uninitiated and review for the experienced. This is the kind of book one wishes existed in every field."
3,Flying Saucer Attack - 'Mirror' (Drag City) 3 1/2 stars,"Follow-up to the UK's duo 'New Lands' CD(see my review). Believe this was FSA's last studio album. First thing one would notice about 'Mirror' is that it's more acoustic than past efforts. Tracks that were the most impressive include the opener ""Space (1999)"", the eight-minute ""Islands"" (disc's lengthiest cut), ""Winter Song"" and ""Chemicals"". Maybe not the best work by guitarists / vocalists Dave Pearce and Rachel Brook, but still a decent swansong and worth a listen. So-so space pop by a artist that used to be considered more like drone / noise space rock."
3,Irregular album with highs and lows,"I am not sure if FSA has good albums, I am certainly sure they have amazing sons. Mirror has it all, some excelent noisy atmospheric sons and some dull acoustic ones. Although they (or he) seemed to be somehow bored in this album, maybe that's why is their last."
1,"For Pete's sake, please STOP MUMBLING","I purchased a bunch of FSA CDs expecting spacey, washed out ambient type music. Their recorded output seems very hit and miss, and Mirror is absolutely a miss. The ""singer"" mumbles over every track, sounding like he's barely humming, barely in tune, and it is supremely annoying. Lord only knows why the band had to ruin interesting instrumental tracks by putting the same boring ""vocals"" over every track - its totally uninteresting, repetitive and unmusical.Avoid at all costs, unless you like your ambient music played with some boring dude mumbling over it. Awful stuff."
5,High-quality kid-safe spray,"Though I'm hesitant to call this kid-safe, since anything that scares away bugs seems that it would inherantly be dangerous to little ones, everything that I seem to find leads me to believe that it won't harm my little ones. I've used it on my kids and neither had any kind of (immediate) reaction.I also took this to Liberia for a three week trip. If you've ever been to a place where Malaria is common, you also know how important it is to prevent mosquito bites. I didn't have a single bite, though I have to admit, I didn't see many bugs during these particular three weeks.I've also used it in Washington, DC, where even 25% deet doesn't always seem to work.Combine it's safeness with the fact that it doesn't stink (much), nor stain clothes and this is a no-brainer purchase.I also took a packet of the Cutter Wipes. The packaging is a tad wasteful, which I normally try to avoid, but they also worked well, with no risk of spilling, which is always a concern with sprays."
5,good alternative to deet,I wanted to try something different other than a deet product. As a frequent camper I see my share of misquitos. This product works very well. Safe to use even if wearing some of the clothes that are made of materials of a high tech nature.
2,didn't work for my daughter,"I was interested in this product because it wasn't DEET. It probably reduced mosquito bites, but my daughter was attacked mercilessly despite a good coat of this stuff. Had to go back to DEET."
3,"OK for Africa, not so hot for Philly","I've used Cutter Advanced (active ingredient Picaridin, no DEET) and have found it VERY effective in warding off the anopheles mosquitoes we were plagued with in Central African Republic and Niger, but not much good against the aedes albopictus (""tiger"") variety that have fairly recently invaded Philadelphia. For domestic use, I'm afraid I have to switch back to a DEET-based product. *sigh*(Note my sample size is 1 traveler... It's possible that aedes albopictus just find me especially delicious. I'm generally a mosquito magnet.)"
5,KEEPS THE BUGS AWAY,"My property is surrounded by tidal water and woods. Needless to say, there is an abundance of flying and biting critters. Cutter 53663 has proven [to me] to be a very good Repellent. Application is much more pleasurable than other repellents that I have used. My other two favorites (Avon & Bullfrog) contain sun-screen and I hate to waste them for short time period exposures to the bugs. It goes without saying that this repellent is deet free and has a nice but subtle odor. Overall this is a great repellent."
3,Limited effectiveness mosquito repellent,"My order for this never showed up, but I still have an old bottle of this, so I felt I could give a fair review. The other reviewers are right that this repellent only last for a couple hours at best. But when it is still fresh, it does remarkably well. My backyard was full of mosquitos during the summer & it was hell mowing my lawn back there. After applying a little of this, you could actually see them wanting to approach you or landing on you and they then they start flying away in disgust. It doesn't have any offensive odors as well. But I decided to go with another repellent that claims 6-hour coverage, but was a bit more expensive. So, in the end, this would be an excellent product if it could last longer & was water resistant."
4,Repellant with Picaridin,This repellant works well for me. I like the Picaridin ingredient because it has a pleasant ordor and is not sticky.
2,"Easy to apply, poor performance.","Using this product during mosquito season in Alaska resulted in roughly 3x the bites as the low percentage deet formulation it replaced in our toolbox. It does not cut down significantly on the mosquitoes attracted as deet does, but it does appear to prevent a decent percentage of insects that alight upon your skin from actually biting.On windy days with light bug pressure it works quite well, but anytime the wind falls we now become a swarming mass of bugs even with heavy applications. Probably suitable for low-pressure areas with limited bugs, we can top 1,000 bites/hour in many areas and it just doesn't cut that number down to a ""sane"" level even if it does block MANY if not all or most of them. We will be looking for other deet alternatives over the next week, in the mean time we're wearing full bug netting, gloves & duct taping collars.Only recommended for suburban backyards with low biting insect numbers."
4,It's Bug Spray,"Worked ok, kind of a pain to keep squirting it over and over. Thinking an aerosol would have been better."
1,Cutter Advanced ...worthless,I am a fishing guide. I spend more time than most trying to ward off pesky misquitos. I have been useing cutter products with good success. I saw the reviews and decided to try the cutter advanced....Advanced means better right?...WRONG! ..Big Mistake!! This stuff is almost worthless. It may be better than nothing but I have apllied 3 times as much 5 times as often. Despite this.. I am continually being eaten alive by misquitos using this product. Its a wonder to me that it is still on the market? Do Not waste your money like I did.
3,ok,"I like that its deet free, but found a better alternative that last a long while and has additional benefits. I would buy this again as a secondary alternative."
2,So-so protection,"I bought this spray because it doesn't contain Deet and is in pump, not aerosol, form; however, its protection was meager. I used it on a beach in Honduras to protect me from sand fleas. My husband chose to use nothing. I ended up with half the number of bites, but I still had many bites. In even more insect-heavy areas of Central America, I had to resort to a Deet product because this Picardin-based repellent did little to discourage biting flies. This is much better for mosquitos than for other biting insects.While I would use this spray in instances where the flying insects are bothersome but not relentless. In areas where your health may depend on repelling insects, look elsewhere.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"
5,"Peruse it at your leisure or use it as a ""must see"" tourbook","If you want to know where to go, and the special places to see in Maine, this book will serve as an inspiration for the unconventional traveller. It captures with its beautiful photography and concise, evocative prose the essence of all that the state has to offer. I have lived in Maine for 12 years and looking through the book reminded me of some of the beautiful places I have been, but it also showed me how many other places are left to explore! Unlike a regular tour guide, these photos bring the places to life and draw you in -- after seeing them I am inspired to make a list of places to go. Some of the photographs are almost painterly in style, there is one of a Native American sitting by the river on a rock at daybreak which is haunting -- mist hovers on the distant bend in the river while the man is gazing in sharp focus at the coming day. This would be a great gift for anyone you know who loves Maine."
2,Bunglers and Bozos,"Most of the stories of the activity into North Vietnam reads like a Keystone Cops comic book. For the most part, a depressing account of the ""recruits"" the CIA had to work with. Lost patrols, predictable ambushes, North Vietnamese deception techniques, among political foul-ups leads you to wonder why they ever attempted that Secret War.If you want to know why the U.S. failed in this Secret War; you came to the right place. This book will have your head shaking in disbelief through most of your reading. Good Luck."
4,very good follow-up to 'predicting events',In her second book Celeste Teal reveals something more about techniques for prediction. Though she refers a lot to techniques already mentioned in her first book the most valuable parts in this book are about the return charts and the transit descriptions by dr. Smith. This book is a must read for all astrologers.
5,"could have been better organised,,but excellent source of information","this book contains quite a lot of very useful information,,both technical information as well as good reference information.pleased with the author's writing style,,but it seems to be a bit confusing at times..as she seems to be thinking very quickly and throw in things (although very useful) in little hidden places,,so is necessary to reread over and over again. great book to have as a reference too i think."
1,Bad organized and very confused,"You waste a lot of time trying to find what you really want, apparantely it's well organized, however in fact it isn't. It is very confused, she mixed up the different techniques and you don't really know what is she doing."
5,"Great Tape, Great Service",I love this tape and appreciate being able to receive it in time and at a reasonable price. Thank you
2,Not a self help book at all.,"I read the introduction of the book online and thought it might be a good self help book to understand anger. However, the book gave a lot of exercises with abstract questions and no explanations or further readings. I guess unless if the person is already in somekind of anger management workshop or have a therapist to guide her, it is not a useful book at all. It's actually quite a frustrating experience."
2,"This is a workbook only, not text!","I bought this book in error, I thought there would be something I could read and learn with maybe a few writing exercises. Either I should have read the description better or else a better description should have been written. Anyway, there is only one or two short paragraphs to read then a whole bunch of questions to answer. Some of the questions I didn't even understand, and there is no explanation afterwards as to what my answers mean. I was very disappointed especially since I am unable to get my money back, having written in it already."
3,experimental ethnic folky instrumental chamber rock,"Volapuk are a French trio consisting of clarinetist Michel Mandel, percussionist Guigou Chenevier, and cellist Guillaume Saurel, although they all play other instruments. These little pieces exist firmly on the border between rock and classical, sometimes heading one way and sometimes another. They're quite enjoyable, and some, like Technovo, Sanza, and L'oeuf d'Apuk are excellent. Others, like Valse Chinoise and Entre 2 Zoo, are rather forgettable. RIO fans shouldn't miss this group, but in general I'd say they're only ""pretty good""."
2,"Ok, but must be better out there","This was ok when used as a ""ball"" ring, but the stretchiness of the rings did not work when used as a ""cock"" ring. Sorry, but that was my experience...... May be better alternatives than this one..."
1,Worst Item I have ever purchased from Amazon!,"Super Stretchy Erection Maker Silicone Black and Multi-Color Cock Ring 3 PackThis item is junk, breaks, useless! I wouldn't advise anyone to invest the time or money to purchase this item. There are many similar items that are much better and last a lot longer! This item breaks; the material is lacking any durability!"
4,cock rings very effective,The cock rings are very effective in helping maintain an erection for individuals with ED who are taking medications for ED. My wife also appreciated their effectiveness. I can climax quite easily when using these rings and stay hard long enough to fully satisfy my wife. we both enjoy using them.
2,Bad quality rings,"They are too small for a regular size penis,you have to be 100% shave otherwise will hurt a lot."
1,Received wrong bulbs. 13556 instead of 13506,"PIAA bulbs are great, but I received the wrong bulbs from amazon. The description and model number both list 13506 which are HB4 9006 bulbs. I received 13556 which are HB3 9005 bulbs. They do not fit in my car, but may fit in yours as they are sometimes interchangeable. Buy at your own risk.(Fog light bubls. Do not use in headlights)"
5,"Incredible music, so so production","This recording is two incredible semi-free open ended jazz jams recorded live at the end of the 1970's. While the masting of this disc results in the music being at a low volume, the music is still incredible, I would recommend finding this on vinyl instead, But I can't recommend this release enough, everytime I listen to it, which is usually after a smoke, it always takes me to new places, and is very very deep and contains some incredible horn blowing."
4,Good starters' guide to the game of ice hockey,This is a very useful if necessarily somewhat shallow overview of the game of ice hockey during the 20th century. It covers all the bases and is very useful for those of us who know little about the NHL's history and all-time greats
5,The classics are always the best!,"I loved this book as a child and was delighted to see that it's still around. Leonard Weisgard's rich illustrations are wonderful, and I'm still charmed by the story of the bunny and the egg. It's great to be introducing this book to a new generation of nieces and nephews!"
5,"It will make you ponder, laugh, and leave a warm feeling....","Eleven years ago, at age two, this was my oldest sons favorite book. Now I find myself searching my memory and shelves in order to obtain another copy so that I might share this classic with his baby brother. After all these years it is everything he and I remember. The text is enchanting and the illustrations are endearing. A great opportunity for parent and child to speculate, laugh and snuggle together."
5,funkiest mofos on the east coast!,"shonuff's are we live? is the best live album i think i've heard. they are one of the greatest live bands on the east coast and they managed to capture this intensity and groove on cd. excellent grooves, great vocals, killer cd to road trip with!"
4,Brother TZ541 Tape,Product is fine. Arrived on time and in good condition. Have used this product in the past and will use in the future
1,Boring,I found it to be a boring episode and it didn't keep my child's attention when we were riding in the vehicle. I would not recommend this
2,"Sorry, my friends....","Sadly, XTC lost me when they lost a true friend of mine, one Mr. David Gregory. Sure, he didn't write any lyrics, but the musical masterpieces he put together for the band were unrivaled in their brilliance. I was horribly disappointed with this album. The two chefs may still be there, but the icing isn't as sweet or as decorative."
4,"Well, 4.5 Stars Really","This album reminds me why I've been a fan for so long. XTC gets back into the pop grind with stunning success!Andy Partridge's songs have never been better and Colin Moulding's contributions (only three songs - a pity!) are wonderfully somber and a perfect foil for Partridge's exuberance. Pop songs brimming with hooks are all over the airwaves, but Wasp Star is a rare breed because it's that and much, much more. The lyrics and arrangements set this album apart from the pack.Not the musical equivalent of a mere sugar high, this album's rich rewards will no doubt unfold after repeated listenings."
4,Subversive Pop,"XTC has a lot in common with The Housemartins. Both bands wrap optimistic-sounding pop music around pessimistic (or at least contemptuous) lyrics.Wasp Star continues that trend. The title for The Man Who Murdered Love is an obvious example. Less obvious is The Wheel And The Maypole:Everything decaysForest tumbles down to make the soilPlanets fall apartJust to feed the starsand stuff their lardersAnd what made me think we're any betterAnd what made me think we'd last foreverWas I so naive?I've really enjoyed this record. It rocks a bit, but even more, it drops hook after hook after hook on you, a barrage of melodic and harmonic bait that gets you on the line and reels you in. Only complaint: the drum machine hinders some songs, We're All Light in particular (though I still love the song). Otherwise, Wasp Star is some of the best stuff that pop music has to offer."
5,Smartly Done,"Like every other XTC album, this a complex stew of clever words and intricate arrangements. Here, they've managed something very difficult--to conceal this richness under a catchy pop veneer. True, they've done it before. But this album combines greater accessibility with a tone that makes it a great backdrop for all kinds of activities--from cleaning the house to making out on the couch to driving down a winding country road with the windows wide open. Sometimes, XTC's propensity to mix sweet music with bitter lyrics has had a grating quality. Though there's sweet and bitter here, you have to concentrate to find the bitterness. It's well hidden in somewhat obtuse lyrics in most instances. Even when the bitterness is clearest, it's written in a light enough hand to keep the sweet sounds bubbling along. Even if you've never cared for XTC before, try this. It's a lovely dessert."
5,"Excellent followup to Apple Venus Vol 1, but livelier","Apple Venus Vol 1, like Nonesuch, took a long time to grow on me but then I couldn't stop playing it, humming it, etc. Loved it!Vol 2, Wasp Star, is much more immediately likeable, yet I haven't gotten tired of it. I can still play it over and over and now it makes Vol 1 seem a bit slow/mellow/tame in comparison.I highly recommend this for XTC fans and for newcomers also. I would still probably pick Nonesuch as my favorite of the latest XTC albums, though."
3,"Good, not great","Overall a letdown. The standout radio tracks are pleasant, but nothing as good as ""Mayor of Simpleton"" or ""Earn Enough For Us."" Dave Gregory's contributions would have hepled . . ."
3,Enjoyable,"XTC's return to the guitar isn't anything groundbreaking, but it is a lesson in guitar driven pop. I don't think it ranks up with their best, but it is nice to hear Andy's voice over music like this. This record is difficult to describe. I think the fact that this record is being released in 2000 is amazing, because it is bringing elements from an older style, which makes it refreshing. Coming from XTC, however, I can't help compare it to their catalog. This is where I have to be honest and say that it doesn't capture me like Nonsuch or Skylarking, or even Black Sea. Nonetheless, there are some wonderful songs on here that blow away much of the tripe passed off as pop music these days. I'm glad this record came out now, and not in the mid-nineties (when most of these somgs were probably conceived), although maybe the wait was a little too long. . ."
2,Meh,"This is a nostalgic dvd that brings back memories of the comedy club boom of the 80's and early 90's. Unfortunately, the material isn't classic enough and is probably still fresh in the minds of die-hard stand-up comedy fans. Perhaps a newcomer to standup would be more impressed by it. Also, comedy was a bit too safe and dull during that time period, so the dvd might generate a few chuckles rather than heavy laughter. Seinfeld fans will feel deceived since he merely hosted the dvd, yet appears on the cover. Thankfully my copy came from a $2 bin. It was worth the price just to see Dave Attell with hair."
1,Poorly made,I bought this along with the regular Digi Draw & I wasted my money. It is hard to see image to trace. Maker's of this product should have put more effort into making this. Big disappointment.
1,impossible to use ; poorly designed,This tracing type art toy is nearly impossible to use. The reflective panels do not securely attach and if you just brush them with your arm they fall down. There is no integrated light with the toy so you need to find a very well lit space to work.My 5 year old and I were extremely frustrated with this toy and will be returning it.
1,"Lame, Lame, and Lame","I got this for my eight year old. Unfornately I read the reviews on Amazon just before he opened it, not before I bought it. This is a great idea very poorly implemented.I am completely dissappointed, and if I had not bought it at a final clearance sale... would be bringing it back. My son's previous method of holding a piece of paper over what he wants to copy and then taping them to a well lit window is much better and cheaper."
1,Don't buy this toy,This is the first review I have taken the time to write on Amazon. This toy is as bad as others have said. So much is wrong with the design - but the worst thing is that the reflective panels do not stay in place- I wanted to think that they MUST lock in place somehow. Has Rainbow Art tested this product? I was hoping to read some Amazon reviews of Digidraw to find out if anyone had a remedy for the panels slipping- The remedy is to return the toy. I will quickly say that the reflected image is a blurry shadow - my boy's can do better freehand. Please don't waste your money!
1,Worst Waste of Plastic Ever!!!,My kids saw the DIgiDraw commercial on TV and just HAD to have it. They saved their allowances to purchase this item. What a sorry disappointment it was! Terribly designed. I must give credit to the kids in the DigiDrawcommercials...they should each receive Emmys!
5,great deal bulbs,"I found a great (five star) service, I also bought two projectors and I received perfectly on time overall Great dealThanks"
1,Perpetuating Nonsense,"Too bad one star is the lowest rating available - it deserves a-5 rating. I read this book several years ago and still feel the fury of its trite silliness and warped view of Spanish/Mexican relations with the Native American. I keep it only to demonstrate that irresponsible writing about this era still exists. The shallowness of her research is reflected in the shallowness of her story. Who is this misguided yenta, this annionted one who assumes that her ""whiteness"" can bring the abused Indian together with the meanie Spanish? Words don't exist that adequately describe her cavalier attitude. This is the type of book Dorothy Parker had reviewed and wrote ""This book should not be easily put down, it should be thrown against the wall with great force."""
1,A deeply disrectful account of Indian life,"The main reason I finished this entire account of one woman's journey with the Indians of the southwest was because of the familiarity I have with the people and the land there. What a disappointment when I discovered the author to be a brash brazen buttinsky, who although she professes to love the Indian people shows great disrespect. Many of my friends are Native people and I'm sure this book would disgust them. Ms. Fein was impossible for me to warm up to and the whole book was a testament to her rude self-aggrandizement. Her disrespect for things sacred was appalling! If you wish to learn more about the Indians it would be far better to learn from Native authors. It is no wonder that Ms. Fein's co-writer, Lenny Smallfeather, bailed out on her from the first contact with her. I would have done the same."
3,Disappointed Adventurer,"I consider both the title and the editorial review of this book incredibly misleading. This is neither a collection of 50 adventures, nor a guide to 50 places around Virginia. A more accurate description would be a compilation of loving memories about four very tame outdoor pastimes (fishing, walking/hiking short easy trails, flat-water kayaking, and biking) repeated over half a dozen Virginia locations. The book will likely only appeal to those who never spend any time outdoors, or who are satisfied by lengthy anecdotes of quiet afternoons spent sojourning with nature, in place of useful information on exciting and unique experiences that are more deserving of the title 'adventure'. I found this collection of short stories, lists of birds, and even recipes, dissappointing and useless."
2,Why bother?,"I finished this novel a couple days ago and I need to start by saying that this wasn't a *bad* book at all. But it wasn't a great book either.I reached the end and felt...nothing. I wasn't glad I read it nor was I upset to not be in the universe the author wrote either.It has an interesting premise, but I'm not really sure that the author knew what he wanted from the story...there didn't seem to be much passion in the writing and no real reason to *like* the protagonist. There also wasn't a really good reason for him to be an anti-hero.The last two chapters or so were wonderful...but the game isn't really worth the candle."
2,"Very formula, not much imagination","I'm not sure what an author of Resnick's caliber is doing writing this sort of escapist yawner. I think he must have been stuck somewhere with his laptop and banged it out in an afternoon. We've all seen too much of this type of yarn-spinning before.A bit better than wasting an afternoon watching MTV, but not much."
4,Tall Space Tales,"A collection of rogues and heroes meet at an out of the way bar - really out of the way - on a planet at the fringes of human occupied space. It seems to be the only thing there. They share tall tales of their exploits and learn of an approaching war and that the alien invaders have just destroyed the Human Space Navy fleet sent to stop them. So after finishing a last round of drinks they go to do what heroes do. When they return, well, most of them anyway, they relate their tales for posterity.This isn't serious science fiction, nor is it intended to be. It is however an enjoyable romp, which is a bit Gulliver's Travels and a bit Spider Robinson with maybe a hint of Douglas Adams. It is a fun read."
3,Tall tales,"In first section of the book a cast of characters gathers in a bar called the Outpost and swap stories. Tall stories as it turns out. An alien attack is underway and the patrons depart to fight off the aliens. Mike Resnick tells the true story of what happens to each of the characters in the battle that ensues. Then, when all return to the Outpost, each tells his story and the reader can see for himself the embellishments and understatements. The stories throughout the book vary in interest and quality widely. Readable but nothing truly special. I think it started out as a character study but quickly degenerated into a hack work for money. Too bad. I still enjoyed it though."
2,"Great show, lousy read","THIS IS THE PLAY. It is not a book about the play. I didn't know that when I ordered and, frankly, was disappointed. Many plays doesn't read very well and this is one of them. Without the music, the interaction among the characters and between the actors and audience, it doesn't work at all.However, if you ever get the chance to see a good production of ""Smoke on the Mountain"", do so. This wonderful show is about the reunited (Sanctified) Sanders Family Singers doing a one-night performance in a Carolina Baptist church on a Saturday night in 1938. You will not understand what all the fuss is about by reading the play, however. I would read a novelization about the play with insight into the characters if the authors ever write one."
2,Turned Out to be an older version,This turned out to be an older (2004) version of the software. Seller's ad didn't indicate this fact. Works fine however. I've used Delorme Earthmate and Street Atlas for at least ten years now. I thought I was upgrading to a newer version.
2,"Ok I guess, but a little out dated now","This worked fine for a few months, but the relationship to my movement and the map were never completely correct. After a while I couldn't get the GPS device to work. Not a great buy."
1,Buy something else,"The product itself is ok but the firm needs to stop treating their customers like garbage.The product says it works with PDAs but they don't include the software, they rob you for another 39.95 for it. You don't learn this till after you have installed the software that comes with the GPS. Additional software titles are available but they charge way too much for them.Their own software is limited in coverage depth and you have to jump through hoops to use another company's software.They also like to advertise components as coming soon of the Earthmate and then never deliver them. Everything is always pushed back to the point you doubt the promised components are every going arrive.Lastly Staples has this product for less money if you really insist on the Delorme GPS unit.But save yourself some trouble and skip this item."
1,Don't buy this obsolete product!,Don't buy this. It is SA 2003 not the current revision. I waited for SA 2004 release and got Amazon unloading their old inventory on me instead.
3,"Good hardware, bad software","This a nice, low cost GPS unit to hook up to your laptop with the distinct advantage of being fully USB powered, but be wary of the confusing interface of the Street Atlas USA 2003 mapping software. I wash rather shocked when I installed it, as it was a throwback to pre windows 98 style buttons. Anyone used to the ease of use of MS streets and trips will be frustrated by this package. However, the software is actually very comprehensive once you figure out how to use it. I think Delorme should focus on real UI enhancements instead of throwing in some very weak voice command tools that will not work for 90% of people in 90% of situations. Sorry, but the substandard interface gets two snaps down."
2,Only works with Delorme software,"This GPS receiver will only work with Delorme software. It will not work with Streets & Trips or any other non-Delorme GPS enabled software. This is a huge drawback for most people as the Delorme software, at least in my opinion, is far inferior to other mapping software out there."
4,Another Satisfied Customer,"I bought the Delorme Earthmate USB for my laptop because I couldn't afford a GPS system for my vehicle. So, I figured $130 ain't a bad price. So far, I have used it in my area. Knowing that GPS is not 100% accurate, I feel the Earthmate USB is accurate enough to figure out where you are and to find your way. Only downfall is the mapping software. The main roads are fairly accurate. The side roads have less to be desired. Because of that, this product only gets 4 out of 5 stars."
2,"Amusing, but not actually useful","I just got back in the door from my first short trip around town trying to use the GPS navigation features. The voice is great - it does things like flip back and forth between north and southbound exits from the freeway, and tells you to turn on streets that are a block or two away. It also likes to tell you to turn on streets you've just passed.Without the voice features, it's not too bad. You just get a moving dot (or series of dots, actually) and you figure out where to turn yourself. Accuracy seems pretty reasonable for the GPS. I'm not very impressed by the accuracy of their maps, though - they don't seem to have figured out that there are streets/highways where you can't make turns in particular directions.The UI for Street Atlas is abysmal. Apparently, Delorme has never looked at any real Windows application. They ignore most of the standard conventions. There's not even a menu bar!"
3,title,"These plugs have the flat tops that prevent them from falling through (a feature I prefer), unfortunately they are too small for my Gemeinhardt so pull free easily while I play."
3,Kurventheorie,I have just invented a sum Pascal's triangle method of making aMenger cube. This man is one of the greatest minds of the 20thcentury! His books are classics and the Menger cube is one of the universal geomtric figures of nature! END
2,Highbrow Negotiation Techniques,"Although I admire Howard Raiffa's book Smart Choices, this book doesn't appeal me at all. I felt his approach to negotiation too theoretical and extremely difficult to apply to real life issues. As one of the other reviewers states correctly, the book is rather for students of negotiation. I do much more prefer Getting to Yes, which sets an easy framework for approaching negoatiation."
2,We're just not compatible......,"I never could get the thing to work properly, and I don't believe that a Hollywood lighting crew would have helped. The hardware is fairly simple, maybe too simple. Focus adjustment is manual and tedious. The camera sits on a tiny base, and it's so light that you'll need to weight down the power cord to get the thing to stay put. The software has a dozen options for color, brightness, gain, and if you can figure it out, you're smarter than the people who wrote the directions. The major deal breaker was that I couldn't get Windows 98 to load if the camera was plugged in. I don't know what caused that, but every time I shut down the computer, I had to remember to pull the USB cord out, and you know what a pain that can be. I bought this camera because of the price, and I guess I've proven to myself, once again, that you get what you pay for....."
4,"Good deal, but could have been better","This camera is very nice. Quality is not the best but keeps you working if you need only to have video chat with your friends or record low quality video. It was easy to install and run on XP almost without effort. The only annoying problem for me is its awkward positioning. In order to set it up in a certain place, you need a lot of effort. The camera is so light while the connecting USB cable is thick, heavy and inflexible, which means most of the time it will take the camera and fall or change direction to the direction of the cable. While still you can position it with some effort, or clamp it somehow you've got to be careful because the cable is so unmerciful. Also the movement in the vertical direction is not very flexible.All in all. Very nice camera, easy to install, low cost, and average quality, if you can take the effort of positioning it. If you don't make a lot of movement, you can set it up once, and leave it there."
4,great camera!!!,this camera is great for the money!! no need to go for much more expensive ones like creative and logitech...do not hesistate and buy this one...
4,Very Impressed,"For the price, this camera is great! Image quality is nothing to brag about, but the price is! Plus, the camera has a versitle base and is very tiny, fitting almost anywhere. Bought 2 for home networking video conferencing, and very pleased."
4,Works for me..,"It's lightweight and was inexpensive.. I even got it on rebate, so it was rock-bottom. OK, the image quality may not be fantastic, but hey, the quality of the internet chatters who sometimes see me tends to be worse. Balance it out and say..hey..It does it's job. I'm grateful."
2,I could've had a pizza instead,"Instead of buying and installing this webcam, I would've had a poor-quality pizza followed by a few drinks in a pub I don't like and a ride home in a dodgy taxi.It took me a couple of hours to get it all working, and I feel a bit more confident about what webcams are about. This is my first webcam, and I only bought it because it was the cheapest.My policy is to get the cheapest of anything so that I understand it, then throw it away and get something better. This webcam really is pretty bad, but then again I haven't lost much money. I'll look for something better next weekend."
2,Not very good.,"This product isn't a very good one. I bought three of them and feel as though I wasted my money. The light is very, very pale and very hard to use. I purchased it to check the security strip inside dollar bills, but it barely shows it. I would not recommend this product if you want a bright light."
3,not bad,"it does the job to hide your name on things and electronics, but after a short time it wears off"
4,Light a bit weak,"The black light is a bit weak, but it's a good value. I guess I didn't read the information carefully because I got 2 of the Dri Mark w/ Light packages.It's good for using in the bar. You can mark the alcohol level at the start of the day, and check to make sure the level matches with sales at the end of the day. Mark the bottle without your bartender knowing so that you can see if they are honest or not."
5,Spring Lies Waiting,I have not taken this CD out of my radio since I got it. I just recently discovered this artist and will slowly collect all of his work. Great singer/songwriter.
2,Lousy radio component,"I'm about to return my Tivoli iPAL. I am not a fan. I fell in love with the design but that's not enough reason for me to justify the cost of what is essentially a speaker for my iPod. The radio component (both AM and FM) gets lousy reception. I can't even get one AM station on the dial! FM stations play over eachother if they even come in.It's too bad because I want to like it. It looks cool in my office, but I cannot sacrifice functionality for aesthetics.Caveat emptor!"
1,The Least Coincidence,"A playboy is murdered after committing a heinous act. If an innocent man hadn't confessed there would be no reason to solve the case. This is the most flawed of the Goldsborough Wolfe series I have read. Archie approaches a situation with no real plan and becomes a temporary red herring. Along with murder, which is the usual fare in these mysteries, another crime which sets the chain of events in motion seems out of place in a Wolfe mystery. Finally there is a murderer whose motive better fits a cop show on television. This book just does not match up well to the Nero Wolfe legacy and it really stands out as something that only gets published because Nero Wolfe is on the cover."
5,Another great Nero Wolfe mystery!,"Robert Goldsborough's continuations of Rex Stout's books are great. Don't worry. The characters are themselves, not distorted as they sometimes are in the t.v. and old radio shows."
5,great movie,"Having enjoyed the TV series and Sex and the City 1,l thoroughly enjoyed Sex and the City 2. The girls are at their best in this one!"
5,true fans will love it,"For fans that have followed the series and have watched the first SATC movie, you must see this one. It is every bit as good as the first movie."
1,Just so AWFUL,"Pathetic, Ostentatious, Arrogant, Not Funny Swill. As over the top as the whole stupid charade was, Samantha was the worst. The audience is expected to believe that a savvy business woman would make the egregious errors in judgement that she did. Such disrespect for a culture where SHE is the guest. And really, a man like that would never have an interest in a woman in her 50's anyway. It's not fun to admit but a wealthy, attractive man like that would never be with anyone less than 20 yrs his junior.And the Karoake scene, uhg, Samantha please shut up. I feel bad that Kim Cattral even went along with any of this script. She can't be that hard up."
1,OMG,"Pure rubbish. A bunch of visibly aged women in a very silly plot... or more accurately, total lack of a decent plot. The first movie was marginal, but this sequel is eye-rollingly pitiful. Please, please, PLEASE, girls... go home now and stay there... Torture is illegal, ya know?"
1,These girls need to hang it up,"This was a very boring DVD. And, these gals are getting too old to do anymore of these movies. Plus, the movie is spacy, not much substance and it's obvious that they made the movie just to earn money. I wasted $20 bucks on this lemon. Sex In the City 2 was one to many."
3,Tired,"A tired script, hopelessly dated acting and over-abundance of fashion scenes made this hallow sequel simply unwatchable. The characters are past their prime, the idea presented about love simply dated and frankly this movie just isn't worth the price of admission."
2,Not the best SATC,"I have the entire series and the first movie...and I loved them. Sex and the City 2 isn't as risque as the first one, which I liked, but it wasn't as great of a story line either. It was a little dull. I only bought it to complete my SATC set -- but I don't watch this one nearly as much as I watch the series or the fist movie."
3,Sex and The City 2,"Fun but too much like the first movie. Also, too much like the series. I realize these movies are for women, but we women, especially these days have more to think about besides clothes, shoes shopping and men."
2,"pretty embarrasing, actually","was hoping it would at least show Abu Dhabi - to compensate for a really poor plot, but no, that and some views of Marrakesh was all to it"
3,lost,I love Sex and the City series very much. But the director and the screenwriter seemed lost in this film. It's more like a advertisement of the luxury hotel and vacation destination. The story is poor and the performance is dramatic. It's a bad tail to a pig.
2,not what I expected,"The video tape arrived in good condition, and the quality is fine. The movie however, is boring, with a weak plot line. Expected more of this film. Not a reflection of the sale but I had not seen this movie prior to the video, and I was disappointed."
1,One of the worst films I have ever seen,"I am only rating this 1 star as I cannot give it zero stars. Let me start by saying I am a fan of the Sex and the City television series and the first film. However, I found this film to be completely lacking of any entertainment value or merit."
2,So So:,"I watched this movie on a flight coming back from Rome in September, and it became apparent to me that Kim Cattrall's character Samantha is the funniest!!! Kim has more charisma than the rest of the girls put together!!! While SJP was enjoyable in the TV version, she looks stiff and her acting is pretty boring, no emotion at all.... While I did laugh at a few spots, it is a pretty forgettable movie. FYI, watch this movie while your drinking!!!"
1,Worst Movie....Ever?,"As an avid Sex and the City fan I feel obligated to inform the masses that this is by far and away one of the worst movies of all time. The series was clever and funny, and the first movie carried this trend to our general amusement. The second movie was an unnecessary travesty. If you want to watch the complete degradation of all characters we've come to know and love, all the while disgracing themselves and a foreign culture along the way by all means please watch this tragedy of a film. All involved should be disgraced by their association with this film, and the director, producer and writers should be banished from making additional cinematic failures so as to spare us all from spiritual decline."
2,Not a total loss but close !,"Does not stink but not that great either ,Bought it for the wife and she likes it , definitely a chick flick , also these ladies are just too old to do movies about sex anymore , time too retire and go out gracefully , HINT HINT ! Hope this is the last one , had to buy for my wife but would never buy it without pressure from her , not as good as the first one ."
2,disappointng for their last movie!,"I enjoyed the first portion of the movie while the girls were in NYC. The wedding between Anthony and Stanford was amazing! The movie started to go downhill when the girls left their 5th character (NYC) behind to head to the desert. That portion of the film started out ok, but quickly turned into one weird scene after another. It was almost like the writer didn't know how to end the movie so he quickly wrapped it up by having the girls get kicked out of their hotel. It was just strange. Unfortunately I purchased this movie and will probably never watch it again!"
3,"May not have been the best, but...","This movie may not be the best movie ever, but it was refreshing to see an ending that consisted of more than the happy ending (man, wife, and 2.5 kids). It was nice to finally be represented by movie."
3,;0),"I love Sex and the City but the second movie could have been better, what i liked about it was the wedding, the outfits and the last 10 minutes of the movie. It was still ok but while watching it I felt like you were waiting and waiting on the climax to happen. it could have been more, of course they are married with kids but it made them seem married and boring. And Mr. Biggs he was not doing it for me in the second movie and Mr. Biggs always does it for me."
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,"Horrible movie, horrible script, horrible acting, horrible clothes, just plain dumb!the women are old now and looked awful in the closeups, one even had red lipstick smeared, unbelievable silly movie.So don't waste your money on this one!"
1,Unbelievable...,"I guess this is what happens when you don't leave things before they go rancid. But I can say I am appalled by the lack of class and quality in this film.This is nothing like the show or the first movie.This is like a crude, cheap fashion show overdone with terrible performances. Carrie is more annoying than ever, Charlotte is still whining, Miranda is still Miranda, Samantha..oh dear God why did they ruin this character? She used to be confident & classy despite her ways, now she's rude and ridiculous.Let's not forget Mr.Big. He seems to have had a lobotomy and now acting like a boring old man and advises people about marriage. Umm, didn't he cheat on both his ex-wives?Rent, don't buy if you want to see it and don't expect much."
1,shameful,"this movie celebrates and rewards what it should condemn: shameless female excess, narcissism, and superficiality and feminized heterosexual men (not gay)who encourage it all. this whole idea that, in order to be fulfilled, married women somehow ""need"" the selfishness/excitement/fun/freedom of the single life - that men never have without punishment - is sickening . . . and destructive."
1,Pretty Sure It Was Plotless,"I'm no Hollywood writer but I'm pretty sure this movie had no plot. The shark was thoroughly jumped with this one. Big time. I won't even address the totally unnecessary scene in which Aidan reappears and he and Carrie are tempted to start up again. I literally verbalized the fact that it makes no sense that a man who was absolutely shattered when Carrie cheated on him, would cheat when he has a wife and child on the other side of the world.The nanny plot with Charlotte was also a total snoozer. Samantha has to be headlong into menopause by now but she's still acting like a Girls Gone Wild participant. Miranda was pretty consistent and was the only one who didn't completely get on my nerves.Anyway, there are 6 pages of 1 star reviews and all I can do is high-five everyone who has written one. They should have left well enough alone with the first movie."
3,ITS ALRIGHT,I didnt like the story line. The fashions and actors were good. I enjoyed Liza and the intrigue with Adian but the story itself was sort of corny
2,Soundtrack Issues,"I'd seen the movie in the theater when it came out and it was OK, but there is something wrong with the DVDs soundtrack, it winds up lagging noticeable behind about 1/3rd into the movie (so that when Carrie slams down her magazine its several seconds before you hear it being slammed down). I haven't be able to watch the blu-ray version, hopefully that one doesn't have the same issue."
2,A little better than the first one (but not by much),"As much as I loved the tv show, I was disappointed with both movies. This one was a little bit better than the first one. I get so tired of hearing wealthywomen whine that they never have enough of ""Me time"" - oh give me a break! Why get married and have kids if all you want is our own time? I was happy to see that they sent them overseas to the Middle East. The scenes from the Middle East were great however, I was a little offended with their sterotypical views on anything Middle Eastern and the view that the Middle Eastern women were ""happy"" being housewives and mothers. However, at least this movie was a little broad minded with Charlotte (who in the first movie refused to drink the water in Mexico, even though they were in a 5 star resort)."
2,Too Much profanity!,I looked forward to this movie since I watched Sex 1.It was a big FLOP because of all the foul language.It just wasn't very good at all. Same old junk.
3,Sex And The City>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Sex And The City 2,"I loved the first movie and was hoping the 2nd would be just as good, but I was deff disappointed.1. The gay wedding is so unnecessary, I'm gay and was totally offended by the whole thing......it was so stereotypical and over the top....I was cringing the whole time especially when Liza sang! Not to mention that scene is way too long.2. It's a little bit boring, there's not enough going on plot wise.3. Samantha is a little too much, I usually love her but some of her antics in this movie were less than desirable.....like the condom scene towards the end.....that one vividly comes to mind as one of the worst.4. Not enough NYC!On the positive side the movie has some fun parts, I loved most of the girl's vacation and when you've just watched the first movie and are really in a Sex And The City mood this movie will be nice to pop in."
3,dvd movie,Well I was a little disappointed with the movie...it seems like a copy of the real movie. Quality no that great.
2,Love this movie!,"CD has some scratches and stop playing at some parts, but for the price I pay for it, ill keep it."
3,Entertaining... but jumped the shark,"I love Sex In The City as much as the next girl, but this installment jumped the shark for me... it was fun, and silly... but not much else...lol. And they are all looking a little long in the tooth... but then again, so am I!"
2,"Sorry, this film is dire","Hey, I'm a big fan of the series, and the first film was tolerable. Sadly, this film isn't. It's a succession of ever-disimproving set pieces, outlandish story lines, and over-styled (yes, that's possible, even in SATC)actresses. Film quality is fine, and the girls are reasonably game, but they are badly let down by a ridiculous story line with zero emotional depth (which was always the bed rock of the series). Probably no point saying 'avoid', cos all the fans will want to see it, but maybe rent rather than buy."
5,Loved SATC2!,"I really loved this movie and the first one as well as the series. I totally recommend this movie to any and all SATC fans! I am also giving this a 5 star rating to offset the negative reviews. I don't feel the need to take every little piece of the movie apart and give it a poor review because it was a great addition to watching the SATC girls lives continue to unfold and go along with them on the ride of fun, drama, and adventure!"
3,Nothing Special on the Two-Disc Special,"I am a big fan of Sex and the City and I purchased the 2-Disc version hoping for the extras. Unfortunately, the 2nd disc had only 30 minutes of extra content (some of which was repeated from the first disc). Plus there was no commentary, deleted scenes or out takes. If you're looking for additional content that relates to the movie, don't waste your money on this ""Special Edition"". It's a total rip-off."
1,Disappointment,"This is another purchase I wish I could get my money back on. It was so bad I had to force myself to watch the entire thing, hoping that maybe there might be a good part. I was very disappointed especially since I'm such a big fan of the tv series and the first movie."
1,No sex. No city. Just dull and racist.,"This is a travesty - a disjointed, badly-written, spectacularly crass insult to an intelligent and VERY funny series. The shift in setting to Abu Dhabi leads to a embarrassing series of racial stereotyping, the four leads come across as spoilt and arrogant, and the plot is basically made up as it goes along. There is one redeeming scene - a terrific exchange between Miranda and Charlotte about the headaches of motherhood as they get drunk together - but that's it.So disappointing. Such a shame."
3,These woman were never profound,"It's just entertainment. People, especially woman, are so bombarded by media every second of our lives, that they believe that the actress/actors are really the characters that they are playing. It's all fake folks! Like the cities/towns built on Hollywood backlots, it's all for show, it's make believe, phoney, not real. It's on TV so we watch it, unwind from a hectic day, have a glass of wine and relax. Don't forget these actresses make BIG bucks to act this vapid. Just enjoy the fakeness of it all."
1,SATC 2,"WELL I'VE BEEN WATCHING SATC SINCE THE BEGINNING..LOVE IT! HOWEVER THIS 2nd MOVIE FALLS WAY SHORT..OR SHOULD I SAY BORES ONE TO DEATH BECAUSE IT'S SOOOOO LONG. NOT A GREAT MOVIE, ACTUALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS HORRIBLE! WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT..THE CLOTHES WERE STUNNING THOUGH..IT WAS LIKE A VERY LONG FASHION SHOW WITH A LAME BACK STORY!"
5,Fun! Fashion! Sex and The City!,"I am doing a five star to counteract too. But this is a wonderful film and I liked it better than the first one. The fashion, the fun, the story, it was all a hoot. I found this film much funnier and much sexier. Love it and cannot wait to see it again."
5,SATC 2,"I got a good price for this movie, I checked at stores so I'm pleased with my purchase and doubly so because I got both SATC movies for what one store was charging for SATC 2. I didn't get to see it in the movie theater because I gave birth while the movie was released. A must for any SATC junkie."
2,better than expected,"I didn't think there would be much of a plot, but there was and it was well acted for the most part. Still only a 2 star movie."
2,Obnoxiously Pitiful,"What a worthless piece of trash. Patently offensive throughout the length of this epic in boredom. No laughs. Uggggh. Had to tolerate this becuase my wife insisted on sitting through to the bitter end, but she didn't like it any better."
4,"Like movie, seller good",I'm a fan of Sex and the City. The first movie was better but this one was still entertaining and funny. The seller I purchased it from sent this quickly and new as promised.
1,Step away from your keyboard or remote this movie stinks!,OK in a moment of weakness I agree to watch this with my wife over our Roku. I had see the HBO series and while I was not a fan I didn't dislike it enough to write a review. This movie is painful and it is obvious everyone was just cashing in. Do not waste your time or money. Why was it bad? The characters and plot line are turned into a joke in this movie. No women would act this way. Its nonsense. For those of you who ignore this don't say I did not warn you. This is a insult to humanity.
1,Over the top abuse,"For those of you mindless enough to believe the movie is just about fashion and fun - look deeper. One reviewer here wrote that the negative reviews of the movie reflect the emptiness of their own lives. Wow, what a comment. Now if that comment were based on critical reviews of say - Breakfast at Tiffanie's I'd agree. However, this is a review of Sex and the City 2. Rotten Tomatoes which aggregates other professional reviews gives this movie a 16% out of a possible 100%. This is not good. But more telling is what is beneath the ""fashion and fun."" For this read the review here:[...]If you still don't get it then cheers - you're exactly the idiots that pay for this nonsense and ensure more tasteless movies are made."
4,Not as good as #1 -,Still can't beat the first. Fashion was incredible. Did enjoy the women's clothes beneath the Burkas. Should have been set in NYC - part of the charm of Sex and the City - is the City!
1,An education on what not to do in another country.,"Seeing all of this movie is on my bucket list. It's been on my bucket list for about two years now because I can only seem to watch about 10 min of the film every three months or so. Not only is the behavior of the women vapid, superficial and embarrassing, I am fairly certain it would land them in jail in Abu Dhabi. They are in new outfits in nearly every scene and storywise, it's within the course of one day. Who changes clothing five or six times a day?! Horrible."
