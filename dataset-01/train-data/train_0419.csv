4,A Time Machine,This video was like a time machine. It took me back to the early 70's. A glimpse of a bygone era of Rock and Roll. The musical performances were wonderful with good quality video and audio. Jimi's acoustic performance of Waitin' for a train was worth the purchase price.
2,Not what I expected,"If you want to hear people talk about Jimi, than maybe you'll enjoy this. I managed to see him play twice, back in the sixties, and the live footage here is very disappointing. There is the star-spangled-banner performance at Woodstock. The only real thing worth watching."
3,blah,"too depressing, not enough love.""i wanna tellyou, lord, i'm a lover. i said i'm a lover.""-jimi hendrix"
4,"Great crimper, lousy cutter","I'm doing a project requiring a lot of crimping and wanted some real crimping pliers do be sure to do it right. Thought I'd give these a try to save a few bucks. The verdict is 5 stars on the crimping and 1 star for the cutter. The crimping is solid, secure and even - 100% happy with that. The cutting tip is almost useless but that isn't really a concern to me since I have good nippers to cut the wire. I bought it for the crimping function and that is perfect. I consider it money well spent for the purpose. Don't buy these if you are looking for a commercial quality superb set of pliers but for home use and crimping only I don't know how you can go wrong for the price."
2,can't reccomend these...,"As a car audio/security technician I use crimpers everyday. They are probably used more than a screwdriver. Years ago when I first started and knew nothing about anything, I bought a set of these. Horrible purchase. As someone else stated the jaw is too wide, and the handle is too short to provide good leverage. I have to exert more energy to make a solid crimp than I do with other crimpers.Do yourself a favor and pick up a set of Kleins, Irwins, or Channel locks. Anything but this. The only thing I can think of worse than these are the cheap multi tool crimper/stripper/cutter tools you find for like $5 at home depot. But those aren't even THAT much worse."
4,works,You do not get the tool pictured. You get the newer version with thicker grips. A bit awkward in the hand with some noticeable flex when crimping. Overall still decent for the price.
5,Good crimper.,"Great crimpers for a great price. My boyfriends likes them a lot and he uses them every time he needs to work on wires, wven I used them and didn't have a problem."
3,Okay but not like Kline's,These are okay for home use but not for professional installers. The handles are not long enough to get good leverage so you can crimp connectors easily. We had some women using them and they had trouble crushing the connectors because the crimping surface is wide so it requires more pressure than a thinner edged tool. The cutters are okay but not the best.
2,Color Coating Chipping Away,"I bought the satin pink color Razor for my grand daughter. She is not careless with her sports equipment. I am very disappointed that after only a few months, the color coating on the helmet is chipping off in dime size hunks."
4,"Good, but not enough stories","This book is a good supplement to Wheelock in that reading the brief stories gives the student of Latin a feeling of accomplishment. One feels a sense of progression in being able to read several related sentences instead of a list of unrelated sentences in the textbook. A glossary for each story is handily located across from that story, eliminating the need to search through pages in the back of the book. The only reason I can't give this book 5 stars is that it is too short. Considering the selling price and the brevity of the stories, several stories to accompany each Wheelock chapter should have been offered."
3,Be warned- this book does NOT contain the translations,"I was a bit disappointed to find out that not only does this book NOT contain the translations (answers) to the stories but the teachers guide (answers)is extremely expensive or must be ordered from the UK. The US version will set you back a good 40$. The UK version is a much more reasonable 15$, however it would take awhile to get here. So if you are going to buy this to study for a test just know that you have to order it early.That being said if you can afford the time/money I would say go for it. It seems like a good little book and is organized clearly. I just wish that I had known I was buying a book that is useless without the other one!"
3,No images,I downloaded this hoping it had images. You can get the same book in the public domain without images for kindle and also in pdf with images at [...]
5,Outstanding,"Taught my 3 children to read with this set, this is to get my grandson started. They were always way ahead in reading."
4,A grand finale to the Soothsayer trilogy,"Penelope Bailey, known as The Soothsayer and The Oracle, has finally come into full command of her powers. While a religious fanatic proceeds with his methodical conquest of the galaxy, Penelope begins working on her own grand Plan. Her old nemesis, the Iceman, reluctantly leaves his home to track her down, and stop her before she can realize her designs. Peopled with great characters like The Gravedancer, The Silicon Kid, and many others, this book makes a great and satisfying conclusion to the Soothsayer/Oracle/Prophet trilogy."
3,Failed to credit the artist in her youtube trailer!,"Although she provides a detailed instructional, someone asked about the song used in her youtube trailer [...], and she didn't give the proper credit to the artist.Here's the info if anyone is looking for that song:The song is called ""Move Your Belly"" by Said Mrad (original artist), available on 2 different albums: ""Electric Oasis"" or DJ Nader's ""Move."" The DJ Nader version has the awesome electronicized vocals."
3,Not one of his better stories.,"I have been a huge Edward Lee fan for years and always get excited when I see something new from him. I was excited to read this book but was let down by the story. I normally love all of his stories, even the ones that are outright disgusting. I kept reading and reading, hoping that it would turn around. This story seems like a tamed down version of something that could have been awesome. It doesn't have the same twisted and grotesque vibe that Lee always has in his stories. It didn't have the little things that are the same in a lot of his books such as a specific door knocker/image that is in almost every single one of his books. I was disappointed with what I paid for."
3,O.K.,"This was an ok book, but not one of my faves. It was still a good read... I would still recommend it.... Im having a hard time finding a book by Lee that tops the first ones i read...the Infernal series.... Those were the best reads.... But pick this one up... I read it in a day....."
2,"Love the novel, the formatting for Kindle is problematic, though","Love Edward Lee, love this book and have been waiting for it on the Kindle. There are numerous typos on almost every single page, however. If I hadn't read the novel several times I wouldn't be able to figure out what was being talked about in some areas, ""chandelier"" is ""delier,"" etc. I've picked up most of Lee's stuff on the Kindle and while I know some formatting issues happen, this one needs some corrections! 4 star book, -2 for formatting!"
3,HARDCORE HORROR,"I had a jaw-dropping good time with this book by hardcore horror author Edward Lee. True, he is not a very literary writer, but try as I might, I couldn't put the book down. I've been reading horror for almost 20 years and it's rare for me to be shocked by what I'm reading. However, with THE CHOSEN, I was aghast many times during the graphic gore and sex that is plentiful throughout the book. Edward Lee isn't afraid of anything when he writes and I appreciate his no-holds-barred approach. This book is definitely not for the weak of heart. You were warned."
1,Pathetic,"I really wanted to like this book, but Lee couldn't write his way out of wet paper bag. The characters are horribly written, the viewpoint is juvenile, and the style is even worse. One might even think the author lived in his parents' basement for all the insight he manages to deliver on adult subjects."
1,Does not load....,"Don't buy this game. It is a dated edition which will not load onto your computer. The seller knows this, suggesting that ""you contact Atari"" for assistance. Disappointing....a bad investment of your time and money."
2,The Sound Stinks!,This *could* be a great psychedelic cd but the sound quality reminds me of one channel mono. Time to bring out a nice new remastered STEREO version of this cool cd!!!
4,Nice variety,My parrotlet loves this food although the bag arrived and had been cut and seeds were all over the box.
3,Entirely mediocre,"A solid, if limited, textbook. The author provides an entry level approach to analysis without much use of more abstract topological concepts like metric spaces. A decent book for the reader who desires this type limited approach. Even in that light it is hardly spectacular as the author's logic often does not flow as clearly as in alternate textsThis book might be better viewed as an auxiliary text beside a classic like Rudin or the very good Real Mathematical Analysis by Charles Pugh."
4,"book good, electronic version poor","This book is pretty good. I bought the online version to be able to copy extended formulas into a word program. It doesn't do it. After several attempts with Amazon customer service's suggested fixes, it still doesn't work."
1,Not a good for beginners,"This book cuts down the material to bare minimum. Skips lots of proof definitions, you may get confused when doing the HW. Three examples is not enough to help you understand a chapter.Examples in this book are theoretical. Symbols and Greek letters make the material more confusing.I find Steven Lay's book give definition of proof, and explains how to use it.Sellers online rate this book high so they can sell the book. Read the book for yourself before buying it, it may save you a lot of money."
3,this book is ok but nothing special.,"the book is rigorous. it is not very ""user friendly"", but it is hard to be with such dull material."
3,"Average Book , Weak in some parts","This textbook represents a new generation of American texts in Analysis that try to overcome the terse and confusing style of Rudin.The text begins well , as it presents the topic of real sequences with many solved problems and theoretical theorems.But then something strange happens :as we progress through the text the explanations and solved problems become less and less , and it becomes more difficult to learn the new concepts.It seems to be a downward trend as the final chapter on Riemann Integration is very badly presented due to the fact that the important examples and problems are simply not present.The Author should have given the same high quality treatment given to sequences to the other topics in the book.Still, with the 3 star rating I am giving this book, it is better than most textbooks on Elementary Analysis."
5,The true spirit of American rock,"When I listen to this album, I imagine a rock guitar floating in front of a waving American flag. Survivor is the band that truly represents white American music for me, having the best of both fast and slow, sounding hard yet melodious, heavy yet tuneful, and truly well-composed. If you have this, don't forget their next album, The Search is not Yet Over. It rocks!!"
5,Survivor will always have a place in my mind.,Most people when they think survior only bring up eye of the tiger or burning heart. Maybe the search is over. I'm sure you've heard of the songs maybe didn't know it was survivor. But they had so much more just invisible to the public's eye. I think the most overlooked aspect were their piano ballads. Even on this album they are missing some great songs like. Pointing them out would be pointless. I know. Everyone complains about song that were not inclued on greatest hit packages.Still you have to admit survivor song had instant appeal and even now don't sound too dated on the whole. I love the piano accompaniment on most of the songs. And the vocals are soaring too. Too bad they didn't release the 16 song japanese version greatest hits in the US. Much more complete.
5,Where have all the good bands gone?,"The 80's where a time of great music that will last a life time to listen too. Music where you can rock and still understand every word that is sung. Survivor is one of those bands and its greatest hits album proves just that. Every time I hear "" The Search is over"" I think of that pretty blue eyed girl Anne I dated in the 80's and where is she now. Well the search wasn't over, but we still had fun didn't we Anne Marie. All 80's fans Rock on!"
4,Survivor ROCKS!,"As what can only be considered a ""casual"" Survivor fan, I was so impressed with this CD. I bought it for the standbys such as ""Eye of the Tiger"", ""Burning Heart"", ""The Search Is Over"" and so on, but in the process I was introduced to other material with which I was previously unfamiliar. ""Moment Of Truth"" and ""American Heartbeat"", are, note for note, two of Survivor's BEST tracks. The latter especially stood out, since I bought the CD shortly after 9/11. It is not a political or patriotic song but it brought me out of extreme sadness over the tragic day, into anger and proceeded to pump into me the adrenaline of wanting to ""beat somebody's ---"" (while I didn't actually do so). Two unreleased tracks, ""Hungry Years"" and ""You Know who You are"" are the weak spots here but all in all, an awesome CD."
5,A great CD,"I saw Survivor in concert in Las Vegas on May 5, 2000. and they rocked. Everybody got up and danced when they performed Eye Of the Tiger. Needless to say that Eye of the Tiger is one of my favorites, but there are so many other great songs. I bought this CD after I saw them, and I never get tired of listening to it. ""High on You"" and ""Is This Love"" are such energetic songs you will find yourself singing along when you listen to them. The Search is Over is a lovely ballad that shows the versatility of this 80s rock group. You will love this CD."
2,Which decade do you like ?,"I regret why I chose this title. Afrer all, I like the era of ""High on you"". If you love ""eye of the tiger"", please try this. But, if you really hook up on ""High on you"" or ""search is over"", you should try original one, ""Vital signs"". There are more great songs. I bet."
4,"good, but not Dimmu's best work","I happen to be a huge fan of Dimmu Borgir, and this was one of the last cd's by them that I've bought (but I still need some others to complete my collection), and I must say, I was quite disappointed. I listen to Dimmu because they put some melody into their music, but this cd is for those who prefer black metal like dark funeral. However, Old Man's Child, a band I usually don't care for, wrote some stellar songs for this album. Their 5 songs were more ""dimmu-ish"" than those that Dimmu did."
4,Nice fountain,THis is a pretty fountain. It makes a nice sound. It is resin/plastic but looks like an old fountain hand pump. It could sit on a deck or on a table.
3,Not Quite the Quality I was expecting,"I've bought polishing tips for my dremel from other companies and though they usually cost a little more the quality has always been better than this set. None of the tips are as large as the Dremel polishing tips, and some are just so flimsy that I'm not sure if I could use them or not.I have to mention that I use this type of polishing tip for putting a highly polished look on knives, and in other cases these might be great. But for working on metal this purchase just doesn't work that well for me. Others who are polishing wood, or some other non-metallic project might find think this is a great set, but next time I'll be buying the Dremel set."
2,Wake me up when it's over... (YAAWWWNNNNN),"Though the first thing that I noticed while listening to this CD was the poor tonal quality of the recording, what I was most disappointed with was the overall lack of tempo in nearly every piece. To quote my husband, ""It's supposed to be a marching band, not a strolling band!"" Also a few of the pieces are really excerpts and not the entire piece, not good excerpts at that."
4,"If you love America, this is for you!","This is a great compilation of U.S. anthems. When you listen to this, you feel like you're in the middle of a July 4th parade or something. It's amazing."
4,An incredible voice!,"I've seen Brenda Boykin many times at the Cotati Jazz Festival and she is one of my all time favorites. She has an incredible voice and she puts on a fantastic show. Her music and delivery is so unique and she has so much fun with her music and the audience. If you every get an opportunity to see her, don't miss it. This CD is a must for anyone who likes blues, jazz and music in general. It's not the same old stuff! And that voice, . . . . . it is magical! Brenda, please come back to Cotati."
5,Outstanding!~,Nothing beats Coco Lopez for super pina coladas! Stores well can be used a year or more later just shake well. I wouldn't buy anything else!
4,Mix of gospel and classical country harmonies,This CD is a great mix of pure country and gospel tracks. The songs seem heart-felt and the voice is one-of-a kind.
5,Lonesome Standard Time Review.,"Kathy Mattea has a pretty voice,and this was the first album she made after recoveing from an operation on her voice.It acutally came out stronger than before.Her interpetation of Larry Cordle and Jim Rushings Lonesome Standard Time is great, as well as Knee Deep In A River.An album with good songs."
5,A cool album from a cool british band,"This album is amazing. I know Earthtone9 aren't a household name yet but you need to check this band out. Out of the three albums the band have done I would say this is the best starting point. Opener `Grind and click' is a archetypal E9 classic, mixing brutal heavy riffs with a small semblance of melody, while at the other end of the spectrum is `0...0...0...' a melancholic Kyuss meets Alice in chains track. I must also mention the excellent `Zechariah rush', a real epic sludgefest which really grows on you after a couple of spins. I don't really want to find comparison points with other bands because E9 have a really unique thing going on but it's fair to say that if you like Will haven, Deftones, Snapcase and Tool, then this is the sort of thing you are going to love. Original, challenging, brutal and rewarding are words to describe this album. Far superior to any contrived and manufactured MTV nu-metal."
5,Exactly what was needed,After 2 years or so the vent lids of trailers get very brittle and break or blow off in transit. Rather than buying a whole new vent assembly ($40+) these lids are simple inexpensive replacements.
5,Open and Shut deal....,"I was hesitant when i purchased these vent lids....not b/c of the brand, (i have had great success w/ camco products), but b/c it said if replacing certain vent lids. I had no idea what brand i was replacing, but i took a chance and bought 2. Here's the deal, this is only the lid, it is not a whole unit. there is a metal piece on the back w/ 2 ears you will bend once installed so it will not slide off. So, if you are replacing lids, look on your old lids to see if they have ears to open (unbend) that will allow you to slide the old lid off. It is easy (if you don't have roof coating on the ears). I would buy again."
2,"Gentle Ben, the movie","This movie states that it is based on the book, Gentle Ben, by Walt Morey. It is VERY loosely based on that story. The movie tells a good story, but very little of it resembles the wonderful tale told in the book."
2,Not what we expected,"We ordered this movie after reading the book with our daughter, expecting the movie to follow the story at least a bit. We were very disappointed to see that the only things the book and movie had in common were 2 character names, and a bear (which was not even the same kind of bear.) We were expecting a movie about fishermen in Alaska, not a city kid stuck in the woods with his ranger uncle. The movie was okay, but if you are expecting a story anything similar to the book, don't waste your money."
4,Not what I ordered but OK,"I ordered Poise and it came in a Poise box, but the product was labeled Avant. In one way it was a huge improvement - the glue on the pad coverings made it easy to remove the product. On Poise the glue is so strong it rips the covering to open. Both Poise and Avant are good products."
4,Powerful Majestic Doom...,"If you like swirling keyboards, excellent live drums and emotion-driven compositions, then give this a try! Dark and moody, like lots of atmospheric doom bands, it has an intensity and purpose that is really, really good. Progressive rock fans, which I am, would also like this cd. A good sub-woofer helps! The production is thick and bass-pedal driven. The reviewer who couldn't get past the second song...it's obvious; you missed the slow paced piano and drums on track #4, the wailing cry at the beginning of track #8, and the overall majestic theme and production of this effort. This cd hasn't been out of my stacker since I got it. If you like this style of music... powerful, majestic doom-metal, this cd is really worth a serious look. Play it loud on a good system; you won't be disappointed..."
1,Oooohfah. What was I thinking?,"Wow, this has got to be one of the worst recorded bands in history. I could actually only get through the second track (after scanning through the first track and thinking ""this cd has got to get better""). Apparently they've lost the original lead singer (I got this info from the band's website...don't ask me why I thought to do RESEARCH on this band) and I presume it actually made them better. Do yourself a favor: avoid, at all possible costs, ever listening to anything this band ever records. I'll bet live would be worse. In order to leave this commentary I had to give them a star. I would give the next door neigbor's kid banging on a broken garbage pail lid with a screaming cat two stars if that is the rating scale."
4,Good for Begginer,I have purchased this product for several weeks now and overall I enjoy it. It has good cushion for both boxing and kicking and seems like an item that would last for sometimes. The only negative thing about this product is the handles. I find it difficult to keep it steady for high power punches and kicking. Other than that it's a nice product.
4,Once a Wolf,"Romance among the werewolf set isn't in the plans of Lady Rowena Forester. She refuses to follow her brother's orders and marry the man chosen for her. She has settled in New York and chosen the powerful financier, Cale MacLean. The one-armed Maclean has enemies, the hereditary. His enemy Tomas Alejandro Randall, called El Lobo, plans to seduce and kidnap Maclean's woman. Susan Krinard is one of the best, and I consider her Once A Wolf first rate reading. Werewolves make exotic lovers, and we are fascinated"
1,Painfully slow read,"I could give this one high marks for character development (hence the one star), but little else. It was far too slow and uninteresting. It was all I could do to finish the book."
4,Slow but enjoyable read.,"I,like another reviewer am having a hard time reviewing this book properly. Starts with a whimper and ends with a bang. Indepth, descriptive characters take time to create and this author does it beautifully. Even if it is just a little tedious it is nice to know the back history in order to understand the story. This stories makes a very nice point of the saying ""beware of what you wish for"". It's obvious the female lead in this story had her reasons for wanting her life to be structured in a certain way, but obviously it wasn't really what she needed. Glad to see she got her HEA!"
3,Uneven,"Sometimes I liked Tomas very much; other times he was very spoiled and irresponsible. Rowena, too, was sometimes likeable and sometimes uninteresting or ""stupid"" & rashly stubborn. What was really good was the way Tomas got Rowena to open up and relax, to accept her ""wolfness"". I agree with another reviewer that some of the secondary characters were as interesting (if not more so at times) than the main characters. All in all, it's just average."
4,Good but....,"Don't get me wrong I love this book, but I thought the ending to be rather disappointing. Not that I didn't want Rowena and Tomas to be together but the way Cole bid them farewell.... I thought he was angry with them? Anyway, if you've read TOuch of the Wolf, you'll love Once a Wolf. If you haven't read the first book in the excellent trilogy, I suggest you do. I can't wait to hear the next story."
1,Black and white pics only,"The pics are in black and white only. Unfortunately, all the buses look the same without the color pics. Judging from the beautiful cover of the book, you would think all the pics would be in color. Not so. I bought the book and had to send it back."
4,Swing Out Sister...,"""Swing Out Sister"" shows their talent and consistency with this CD. Get it at a good price and enjoy!"
4,"Strong mix of 70s sound, modern production","With few exceptions, Swing Out Sister can tackle any style of jazz-pop with credibility. This 1992 set proves that the act can lift elements of Seventies soul and make them their own.Corinne Drewery is in fine voice, as usual -- think your favorite cabaret singer meets Diana Ross -- especially on ""Notgonnachange"" and ""Incomplete Without You."" And the title track, a tough rebuke to a wayward lover, is one of Swing Out Sister's best songs.It helps that Drewery and keyboardist Andy Connell -- and the duo's longtime collaborator, producer Paul O'Duffy -- are again joined by some of the best musicians in British pop. That includes the ""Henpecked Horns"" -- sax player Gary Barnacle and trumpeter John Thirkell. Thirkell's jazzy, brilliant solo in ""Understand"" may be even than his tour-de-force on SOS's ""Surrender"" off the group's 1987 debut.Tasteful, first-class music, just what fans have expected from Swing Out Sister for nearly 20 years."
5,"OMG, so adorable!!!","I bought this for my self, as I am a BT Lover!!! So cute, I would love to have a BT flag for all four seasons!"
2,What you'd expect from weird al.,"Al, you're a strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange, strange man."
5,opera for those who can't stand opera,"In an interview, Feldman speaks of how both he and Beckett can't stand opera. This is the result of a crossing of a ""note man,"" as Feldman terms himself, and a word man, Beckett, who are of this frame of mind. Words are barely intelligible here, reminding one of the ""unspeakable home"" of Beckett's piece. The music is more or less as haunting as music could be, slipping in and out of tempo in absolutely unpredictable fashion. This is a work that makes the listener question music itself, absolutely appropriate as Beckett's works make a reader question literature itself. Feldman is so faithful to the feel of Beckett's text that it seems nothing is happening here as the music moves at a glacial pace for the majority of the opera. As the case is with Beckett's work, you finish the piece and your mind is swimming with possible interpretations."
5,Watch Band,"Excellent quality, very comfortable, extra adjustment holes, beautiful color and high quality hardware."
5,"Excellent, lightweight and fun","I just got this vacuum and love it so far. It is really lightweight and super versatile. I like how you can use it on both hardwood and carpet with a simple push of a button. So far, it's super powerful and picks up all the kid dirt and dog hair, which is key since my baby is always playing on the floor. I like how you can detach the powerhead and carry it around by the sidehandle and use the hose to dust or clean upholstery. When you take off the powerhead, its less than 10 pounds.I needed a lightweight vac that I could use all the time and lug up and down stairs. The side handle makes it super easy to carry and it's a lot lighter than most other uprights. Simpler to use than canisters also.It is also super cute with the pretty plaid. The ice blue style is nice too."
2,Not that impressed for the $$!,"I'm surprised to see people giving this vacuum a good review for pet hair. I don't know if it's the suction or just the brush on the head, but during each cleaning I have to flip the head over, pull the hair out of the brush, and poke it in the hole while the vacuum is running! It also won't pick up even the tiniest little hard item, like a 1/4"" sized stone, even if I go to the trouble of setting it right on top so the brush doesn't interfere. This is very aggravating and always makes me wish I was using my GE which picks up hair and much bigger stones very well and cost half as much.I do like its maneuverability and quietness, but I wish it was free standing with the floor head on. Overall, not so impressed and won't buy another."
4,Bobby and Jeff,"Bobby is one of the best of all Lori Wick's characters. She's funny, warm, and very forgiving!"
3,A Little Slow,"This book is OK, a little slow. The first and third have more life and are more interesting. Overall I like this author and will look for more of her work."
4,As Time Goes By,This is a sweet love story. The story begins with two young teenagers who go to a church picnic together. The young man did not want to take this girl because she was unattractive but due to pulling the long straw has to ask her. She unwittingly thinks he's being nice but she discovers later that she is the one no one wanted to take. She leaves town because of the hurt and embarassment she feels. She later returns when she is offered a job by the father of the young man that hurt her so badly years earlier. It's a story about forgiveness and second chances.
5,Wonderful!! Definately a re-read!,"Oh i loved this book! I read it in one day, non-stop! It is absolutely one of my favorites. Even though the story line has been done i still love the way Ms. Wick portrays the characters and events. I love her writings they are wonderful! It is one of those book that you finish and feel satisfied. It is wonderful you must read it if you enjoy soft romance novels. I love this book!"
3,"A relaxing book to read, very charming. I enjoyed it a lot.","I LOVE Lori Wick! She is one of my favorite authoresses, (or authors). I love this particular series because they are so easy to read. Nothing to intense. You WILL enjoy this book! I guarantee it!"
5,Lightning at his best,"Anyone who is interested in blues music should have this great collection. Sam Lightning Hopkins was incredible guitarist composer and singer. This collection includes his singles from late 1940's and early 1950's.Lightning was ahead his time like the title song ""Jake Head Boogie"" really rocks and cut before the official born of Rock and Roll. Another gem is ""Lonesome Dog Blues"" which is a slow piece with a pioneering whole step string bending.Also very rare alternative cuts of both songs are included."
5,best guide book I've ever used,"I bought this guide book along with several others to plan a trip to Scotland. Everything I wanted to know was in this book. The phone listings, bed and breakfasts, etc. were all as described. You know how some guidebooks discuss things or list restaurants, hotels, etc. that are no longer around, or aren't as described in the book? Well this wasn't one of them. It became an invaluable companion on my trip. The history of any area I wanted was basically in the book. The recommendations were fairly accurate, and the maps most useful. This is a guidebook for real people--those of us who dream of a trip to Scotland, but perhaps don't have a lot of money to spend on fancy hotels, rental cars, etc."
3,Lots of Info; not all accurate,"While this guide does have loads of information, I did not find the description of the accomodations to be particularly accurate. And after a day of driving and/or sightseeing, I do appreciate comfort and expect it if it's been foretold."
3,not her best,"ok. i ordered this calendar because i love christina aguilera and i thought it would be worth the money. well it was only worth half the money. the pictures are nice but the calendar part is really small and dull. u can buy it if you like christina as much as me but if u have a busy schedule that u use your calendar for, i do not reccomend it."
5,"Quite unique, as calendars go.","This is a really gorgeous. It's a genuine pinup calendar, as opposed to all those calendars full of Maxim shots. Those are a dime a dozen, but I haven't seen another quite like this one. Christina is dressed in a variety of costumes, wigs, and poses that evoke both a Pussycat Doll and a circus performer. It's both very modern and very influenced by the sexy showgirls of the past."
5,Handbook of Pottery and Porcelain Marks,I bought the book because I am doing research on the China and Porcelain. The book was interesting and informative. It was a good choice because it also contains information of registration dates and manufacturer which is hard to find.
2,Void of Detail and Humor,"This book read like an eighth-grader's diary. Easy to read, but more frustrating and irritating than entertaining and informative. I wanted to vomit everytime the author spoke of how much she loved her trail mates, and especially the second half of the book when she gushes puppy love about her new husband. The author spends too much time discussing her fear of snow, and not enough time telling the history of the trail. I wanted to learn about the development of the trail, and the history of the many national parks the trail runs through. I guess I have been spoiled by other books. If your goal is to get a feel for the day-to-day of being on the trail, and want something that doesn't challenge your mental facilities, then this is the book for you. If you want something that is informative and humurous, in the mold of Bryson, skip this book. For a more informative read about the PCT, take a look at ""Along the Pacific Crest Trail."""
3,An honest account of one woman's difficult journey.,"Cindy is to be commended for her accomplishment. Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is quite a feat. While I would say I liked reading the book, I felt it spent too much time on interpersonal relationships and not enough on the grandeur of the trail. Too much petty bickering, not enough mountain. When Cindy does write of the physical dangers and beauty, the book is at its best. Overall this is probably a good book about the Pacific Crest Trail, if you want a great book read Karen Berger."
1,"Wouldn't hike ever, if this were my intro.",The first three pages would make you return your hiking boots. This woman's bitter and utterly humorless writing style make a concentration camp look like a better destination. She takes one of the most wonderful outdoor recreations and turns it into a death march.
2,dougv,"A slow moving film with too many flashbacks to the boy's past.Many dysfunctional people in the cast, and thus a mostly unhappy movie.Can't think of anything good to say about it.Glad I rented the film and didn't buy it.Don't recommend you see it."
5,Great CD!!!!,"I had never heard of Katie Webster before buying this CD & have to say it's one of the best i've purchased in a long time. If this dosn't make you move, then you must be dead!"
4,Gender Equity as Mainstream Economists See it,"This book can be read at many levels -- used for a course or read as needed. You can answer questions like: How is unfair discrimination measured? Why do jobs that employ women pay less than those that employ men even if the requirements are similar. Go beyond romantic love to answer questions about whether marriage makes sense. Does welfare make peole work less? These two academics represent mainstream, what is called ""institutional labor econmics."" Anyone interested in the labor market, gender equity, international comparisons on how women are doing will find this book accessible. You do not have to have formal education in economics."
5,Great purchase!,"Economics has never been my best subject, but this book explains concepts in a way that anyone can understand. There are a few charts and diagrams that are tough to understand, but overall the book easily illustrates how different the male and female market experiences are.The chapters are a decent size: some range from 15-20 pages and some others are around the 40 page range (but the material is interesting, so it's not too bad!)Overall, this is a great text for anyone taking an economics course."
4,What?,"I received an international version of the textbook even though we are in the US. A little strange, but my teacher is from overseas, and she says the material is the same, just the costs for US textbooks is much higher."
3,Meh...,"I was totally blown away by Amsvartner's debut EP. It had interesting songwriting and a natural, human, organic sound (read: not a perfect performance on the part of the musicians). But this one, well, I just didn't get it. Granted, it's unique, but it's certainly not Black Metal. One could draw a comparison to bands like Solefald, or Novembre or even Ulver on an artistic/progressive/avant-garde level (though the music's nothing alike). I'm not disappointed with the purchase, but I'm not thrilled either."
1,it was ok,"the ankle strap isn't long enough. but the shoe itself fits good. The color is good too. I don't think its a 5"" heel ether"
1,Freeh is proud of Freeh,This is one of the worst books I have read recently. There are paragraphs and stories repeated multiple times throughout the book. It doesnt mention the FBI and his job as director very much. He does his write about his family and the wall with pictures from his children in his FBI office over and over and over.... It is clear that Louis Freeh likes Louis Freeh and wants us to know it.Freeh mentioned in the beginning that it was not his intention to write a book. He shouldnt have!Wait until the used price comes down to $1.00 then it wont be such a waste of money.
1,My FBI... Extended Resume',"I think the writing of this book expresses Mr. Freeh's personal and professional life, as he saw it. I also think that this book's content reveals a self-indulgence under the gist of humbleness... enough so that my antenna was raised. There is perhaps a degree of CYA as well... after all he was appointed by Bill Clinton."
1,Typical Pompus FBI Incompetent,"Self-angradizing should be the title of this book. If Louie had spent more time investigating terrorism and less time worried about the antics of the President, then maybe we could have prevented 9/11. After all, Louie, your own agents were sending in reports of suspected activity. And his attack on Richard Clark and lableing Clark as a low on the totem pole person, clearly shows why the FBI has a hard time catching people. Maybe, Louie, you should listen to those people low on the totem pole - you might just catch someone."
1,Lame,"This is a very lame attempt by the former FBI boss to excuse himself from the 9/11 failure. The theme of the book can be described as two-fold. First is to criticize former President Bill Clinton on no grounds. The fact out of this book is that Clinton thought Freeh entirely incompetent and publicly stated that he regrets the nomination. Second is to make excuses for himself on the 9/11 debacle, which can be largely attributed to the failure of FBI, and especially Freeh.Very very lame and boring."
4,Balance,"The best quality that comes out of this autobiography is how truly honorable this man is. He not only praises the men and woman with whom he worked at the FBI, but he gives the reader a sense of balance by laying out his version of the sensational stories born of 9/11. As someone who swings a bit to the left, I hope Mr. Freeh takes it as an honor that I write that after reading his book, I wouldn't hesitate to work for him: he is so clearly an honorable and straightforward man. As for his book, it's readable and interesting, and, again, it provides a very badly needed balanced account of the more dramatic international and domestic dramas with which we have dealt over the past decade."
4,Excellent book,"Though the book is a bit outdated (about 10 years old), it is an excellent book, with quite a bit of info, techniques, and tricks I am learning for the first time. It is an excellent addition to any web designer's library."
1,Should study English before writing a book,"The book reads like a bad dream rendered in ebonics. For the author, the web is Saturday night TV. I would highly recommend avoidance of this book. I hate saying this, but Microsoft publishes far better books on this subject."
1,"pretty, but impossible to walk in","this plastic ornament digs into my feet, I cannot walk at all, it hurts too much"
4,I really enjoy listening to Mark Elf.,"He is quite impressive in his dexterity and fluidity. There are many good things to say about his playing and I'm sure others will corroborate that, however, he tends to noodle a lot and at times he also sounds very choppy. Additionally, I can't tell many of his songs a part from one another as he tends to sound very repetitive. By far though the most annoying and distracting thing he does is ""sign"" the notes as he plays his solos. I noticed that in some of the songs in his Live at Small's CD, I don't know if he does that all the time. In all fairness, while I have listened to many of his songs and do enjoy his music, I have never bought any of his CDs because I refuse to pay $17 for CDs and it's unlikely that I ever will buy one at that price."
3,Wanted; but also expected varying colors,I ordered these combs seeing the blue pink and said assorted colors. ALL COMBS CAME BLACK AND WHITE. I wouldn't have minded 2 but 10???? Didn't give me a choice
3,not bad,not really into her and I do kind of like the way she used that eddie kendricks sample from intimate friends.

3,No deception here,"Although this book does not really say anything new about the polygraph or about how to ""beat"" it, the book will nonetheless be useful for those in post-tramautic shock from a polygraph experience. It is patent and utter nonesense to suggest that this machine is 99 percent accurate in detecting ""lies"". The only thing a polygraph does is detect changes in heartbeat, breathing, etc. As the author points out, there is not a shred of evidence to suggest that reactions such as this are related to a lie--they may be, but are just as likely to indicate stress or a sensitivity to certain questions. Clifton's book is readable and requires no scientific background. Those of you who have had the unfortunate experience of undergoing this ""vodoo"" science might want to give it a read, just to remind yourself that there is nothing wrong with you--the people who believe in this stuff are the ones who are delusional."
3,Good information,Hope never to have to use the instructions but good to know. Some good advice in this book if you ever have to take a lie detector test.
1,This book is a lie itself,"This book, like many others spouts inaccurate data, supposed facts and unsupported assumptions with no scientific validity.It has little scientific data to support its claims unless they are taken out of context to support the writers self serving viewpoint. First they scare you into thinking there is a problem then they sell you the book on how to solve the problem.Let the buyer beware."
4,Confort Shoe,"I really like these shoes....great fit and so confortable. Nice for fall, wet and small snowfalls. This is my second pair and I will continue to buy them. Great all around shoe.I got them through Amazon for a great price and shipping rate."
4,comfy shoes,"I ordered these slip-ons to wear around the house and to take the dog out. They came on time and were as the ad said.good quality,very comfofortable.however because they were slip-on I ordered them a half size smaller than usual but I should have gone a full size smaller.I told the company and they told me to send them back and they would exchange them for me but I decided to keep them any way. I will order more from them later.James Jewkes"
4,mens mocs,i loved the mocs...totally..but one was 1/2 size bigger than the other one...but it was marked the same..maybe should check on quality control
2,Okay,"I think the shoe is fairly comfortable, but a little too clunky and heavy around the sole area! Eccos are better!"
3,Sport Mocs,They are a basic tan mocassin. I bought them to wear while walking the dog. They are okay for that.
2,Look Nice but Size is Not Good,"I ordered size 10 and I couldn't get my feet into them. I would suggest that if you have swelled or just large feet that you order a higher size. Because there is no elastic, the top of the shoes just doesn't have any give at all. The shoes were long enough for me but just couldn't wear them. My feet aren't all that big either."
4,Worth what you pay.,I like these type of shoes for when I travel and I have to visit the gestapo at my local airport. It makes compliance with this regime a little bit quicker. I don't have to untie my laces or anything like that before the minimum wage federal employee sticks his hands all over me.
3,game of life (cd version),"My old copy of this game gave up the ghost so I went to Amazon's sellers and bought another for a very good price. This doesn't always play very will with os Vista, and then I upgraded to Windows 7 and it doesn't play very well with that either. If you right click the icon and choose ""play as administrator"" I did get it to work with vista and windows 7. But I use it mainly with my little 10"" that is installed with xp. One time the the game froze on me but it played well all the other times. And sometimes it takes a while to start up, but that could be my external cdrom drive which isn't very fast. I love this game. It reminds of times playing the board game with my family when I was a child. It is very similar with some interesting graphics and little video segments. If you loved this as a child (or adult!) you will enjoy this game."
3,Enjoyable but Average,"Yankovic's last three albums (this, Bad Hair Day and Off the Deep End) appear to be falling into a very set formula. 6 songs, both sides, alternating between parody and original music. The parodies on this album are okay -- Jurassic Park is a great song with only one or two weak lines, while Living in the Fridge is questionable.The cover of Bohemian Rhapsody (Bohemian Polka) is an enjoyable variation of Yankovic's perpetual polka-zation of modern music. Of the original music, Frank's 2000 TV is great, almost Hooteresque. Traffic Jam on the other hand is so similar to a parody aired on 98 Rock in Baltimore that I have to wonder if Yankovic stole lines.Compared to his other work, this is middle of the road. It's not as good as Bad Hair Day or Eat It, but it is better than Polka Party."
4,Not his best work,"Alapalooza by Weird Al Yankovic is forty-four minutes and fifty-two seconds and was released on October 15, 1993. None of the songs on the CD charted in the United States. Alapalooza reached #46 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album charts and went Gold. This was Al's eighth studio album. Bohemian Polka just does not have the same ring as the original Bohemian Rhapsody. The rest of the songs in my opinion just don't live up to other Al songs. Alapalooza by Weird Al Yankovic gets a B-.Jurassic ParkYoung, Dumb & UglyBedrock AnthemFrank's 2000"" TVAchy Breaky SongTraffic JamTalk SoupLivin' In the FridgeShe Never Told Me She Was A MimeHarvey the Wonder HamsterWaffle KingBohemian Polka"
3,Achy Breaky Song is by far the best song on this CD,"This CD is good, but I like ""Running with Scissors"" better. Achy Breaky Song is one of Al's best of all time. That's not to say that the rest of the songs aren't good, Achy Breaky song just outshines them. ""Bedrock Anthem"" is pretty good too. If you like Wierd Al, buy this, however, it takes an unusual wit to appreciate."
5,One of the best Al-Bums ever,"This is one of Weird Al's best cd. I recomened it to any Al fan or it's a great first one. Some of my favorites are Young, Dumb & ugly, Achy Breaky Song, and Livin' in the Fridge. Basiclly I like all of the songs on this cd's. Then agian you can have a different opinion. Buy this CD NOW."
2,BORRRING and disappointing,Was hoping to get something a little more historical but it turned out to be a fantasy dinner loosely based on history. I intentionally left the book on the airplane.
1,Not a feature length movie,"I had the impression this was an all new movie. In fact, the Lion of Sodor feature is one of 4 shorts. I thought it was going to be like Misty Island Rescue, which indeed was a full-length, one story adventure."
3,Are you sure this is John Saul?,"I have read nearly all of John Saul's work and this pales in comparison. There was very little suspense in it, unless you read it in the originally published serial format.This novel focuses on the town of Blackstone (New Hampshire?) and the insane asylum built there. Gifts from the old days of the asylum are finding their way into the hands of Blackstone's current populous. With each gift comes some traumatic event and a mystery swirling with it.This is a simple work, but I guess as you read Saul's notes, it's not nearly as simple as it appears due to the serial publishing nature.For those interested in reading something by Saul, I would recommend ""Sleepwalk"", ""The Homing"", or ""The God Project"" over this one."
5,"Suspenseful,psychological chiller!","After reading this I wished I had another dose to fill my pallet! I ate it up! Leaving me with a feeling of perhaps, I lived in this fictional town, yet something was missing. All I could do was hear myself saying ""Mr. Saul..I'm stll hungry!..Please make some more of that delicious thriller!"""
5,Excellent Read ...(Spoilers possible),"I've been reading Saul a long time now. I'm just reading The Blackstone Chronicles because I'd gotten into reading a few other new to me authors and hadn't cycled back around to Saul's work in a while. I'm glad I've picked him up again.This story was wonderful. Set against the backdrop of insanity and an old asylum, you just can't stop reading it.As each character receives his or her 'gift', the small town of Blackstone comes more and more unravelled. As more and more deaths ensue, the air of mistrust and suspicion grow. What is happening? Who or what is responsible? The answer is there, between the covers of John Saul's The Blackstone Chronicles. Take a chilling ride into the town, and prepare to shiver!"
2,Disappointed,"I have read most of John Saul's books, and I would have to say that The Blackstone Chronicles was extremely disappointing. It was not very suspenseful and the ending was very anti-climatic. Definitely not one of Saul's better efforts."
3,"Entertaining, a good idea, but I saw most of it coming","I picked up ""Blackstone Chronicles"" from a bookstore, not because I had heard anything about it, but because I wanted to read some good horror. Now, having finished the book, I can say that it was well worth the buy. A good idea, an excellent setting and it made the hours pass by rapidly. The downside was however, that the foreshadowing gave the game away from early on. Still, I am now hooked on John Saul and will be on the look-out for his other novels."
3,"Lots of fun, but flawed ending","I read this in the original serial form, and it was lots of fun. I love horror stories about horror connected to inanimate objects, such as dolls and necklaces. Also, I love horror stories that make me feel sympathetic for characters who were mistreated by people who should've loved them.This reminded me of the books of this type I used to read in high school -- except that it was better written. The characters are much more memorable.However, I think the story fizzled out in the last couple of editions of the the serial. The ending wasn't as good as it could have been.I had even more fun with the publisher's original ""Blackstone Chronicles"" web site. Especially the diner!Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance"
2,What a lousy ending,"At the beginning, I felt really attracted to this book. The first story ""An eye for an eye: the doll"" was really scary and captivating. Somehow, from that story on, the whole book started to lose its momentum. It became quite predictable and sometimes really bad written.What disappoints me the most is the ending. What a lousy ending, and it's a shame because the ending of a book is what stays always in the mind of the reader. The ending was absolutely BAD: with thousands of loose ends and thousands of incoherencies. Suddenly, from chaos, everything went to peace... What's that? I'm really disappointed. The only good part of the book was part I (""the doll"")."
4,good book...great use of series rollout,"John Saul does a wonderful job of keeping the story lines consistent across all six parts. The story zigs when you expect it to zag, which kept my interest throughout. For anyone who has read Stephen King's ""The Green Mile"" series, this one ranks right up there."
4,One book,"Typical John Saul book - very good if you're into those kind of horror stories.As I suspected, you're basically getting one typical novel-length book. It's just split up into separate stories, I guess because they were originally published in a newspaper or magazine. Anyway, I got an older version for a decent price."
4,"gripping, ending needed major work","I gave it four stars because it was a good book (six stories in one book), but the ending was disappointing, I think he could have done a much better job. As one reviewer said, tooooooo many loose ends, but I must admit I was hooked until the end."
4,Bruce Cameron - 'Midnight Daydream' (Brain Cell),"I remember getting a copy of this CD, after Bruce Cameron had died. Must've been late 1999, just a couple of months after this disc came out. This was Cameron's sole release as far as I know. For a new artist, this guitarist had a lot to say. Good '90's guitar virtuoso work to say the least. About ever cut here rocks, specially the title track ""Midnight Daydream"", the rocking ""Born To Lose"" and ""Thousand Moons"". Check out the line-up here: Mitch Mitchell-drums, Ant-Bee-drums&vocals, Neal Smith-drums, Billy Cox-bass, Jack Bruce-guitar and Bruce Cameron-guitar&mellotron. Might appeal to fans of Eric Johnson, Yngwie Malmsteen, Vinnie Moore and possibly Jeff Beck."
2,Too Derivative of Hendrix For Me,"I have no idea how he was able to recruit Mitch Mitchell, Bill Cox, and Jack Bruce for this project. Sure, he's a good player, but he is not original at all - sounds too much like Hendrix. It's ok to be influenced by someone (especially such a great guitarist as Jimi), but you need to inject some of yourself into the project or it doesn't succeed."
3,V8.10 is out now,"Major changes in v8.10, including a much easier interface to the various RBL's. It is a good book, but time for an update. If you still have v8.9.3 in your shop, you can admin with this book though."
1,Very Outdated Book,"This book is written for version 8.8 of sendmail. Sendmail went through some major changes with version 8.9 and these are not covered in this book. Also, the current version of Sendmail is 8.12.X.Maybe the O'Reilly people should consider an update!"
3,A time in history,"While this book beautifully reflected a certain time in history, I was looking for more drama. Drama happens all around Sim (the main character) but as a reader, I was interested in Sim and wanted to know his dramas, not that of the powerful men he happened to know. This was like an ordinary biography rather than a fictional biography - in that it was simply not exciting. On the other hand, it was a painless history lesson, and absorbing enough that I finished the book."
2,freezing,"I share many of Kris Dotto's opinions about this short novel by Ms Renault but I have some of my own to add.The plot is strangely detached, far away, a sort of foreign dream told by a confused stranger. All the characters share the same trait: it is not that they are not well rounded, they are distant, someone you cannot care for. The story of Harmodios and Aristogeiton is cold, contrived, but even Simonides, the main hero, never really comes to life.More than this, the writing is often very convoluted, rather unclear, sometimes even clumsy. Dialogues are often spoilt because it is not clear whom each line belongs to.All in all, a work not worth the general praise Ms Renault always gets."
2,Circus Delight,This CD reminded me that I dont like lots of accordion in bellydance music. I realize that some people do...fine. I feel like I'm dancing to circus music. If you are a strong earthy dancer the music is too light and etherial.
2,disappointed,"I miss my little, old weber! This Meco 2000 has no vent holes in the bottom, no lower grill on which to rest the coals, & no LID!! I thought it would be a larger version of the little weber but it's not. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed & should have just bought another weber."
4,52 minutes,"Elton said something outrageous and got in the news again and I began thinking about some of his music I heard growing up in the 70's. This is a great collection and if it had Bennie and Honky Cat wouldn't need anything else. (As much as I like his 70's stuff, what he has put out since is tortuous. Not only has he had a throat operation so his voice is not as good, but the music itself...just thinking about it is depressing. So I did not want his 2 cd collection.) Had to take off one star since it is not re-mastered."
5,Very good!,"I love this album! My favorite songs are ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds"" and ""Philadelphia Freedom."" Of course, all the songs are great. Brings back some wonderful memories!!!"
5,Great Songs,"I dig Old Elton John Material.His 70's Stuff was Tops his 80's Stuff So-So&90's thru now Not Too Good.but Here During His peak His Music is a Must.Together with His Songwriting Partner Elton John Wrote Some Great Songs.Philadelphia Freedom,Levon are Two Of The Great Songs here.as a Writer&Musician Elton John is a All-Time Great."
2,Disappointing,"I debated between buying this CD and the soundtrack to ""Almost Famous."" The one song I really wanted was Tiny Dancer. I didn't recognize the titles of any of the other songs. Since I have Elton's Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 and LOVE IT, I decided to get this one too. It was a big mistake. No wonder I didn't recognize any of the other songs -- they stink. If you like Elton and want to get his best work, get Greatest Hits, Vol. 1. Tiny Dancer is a great song, but it's not worth the price of the entire CD. If you know and like all the songs on the CD, go ahead and get it. But I couldn't find any jewels but the one I bought the CD for."
3,On his way down.,"Compare this collection to ""Greatest Hits,"" and you'll spot the trajectory of Elton John's career. ""Philadelphia Freedom,"" for example, must be the only hit song ever that was a tribute to a tennis player -- and to professional, team tennis! ""Lame"" is too weak a word. The cover of ""Pinball Wizard"" is lamer than The WHO's original, which was also soporific, and one cannot listen to it without recalling Rod Stewart's story of Elton deceiving Stewart out of taking the role. I could go on, but the point is that this album is full of third-rate material that was only ""great"" next to Donna Summer, America, and The Silvers, Elton John's '70s competition. Ugh."
3,Elton John - Greatest Hits Volume 2,"A quirky mix of certified hits and songs not released as singles. The songs were chosen from various albums and singles released between 1971 and 1976. Though this compilation features some of the best material Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote during this time period, there are some curious choices and omissions. For instance: ""Feel Like A Bullet(From The Gun Of Robert Ford)"", from the 1975 album ""Rock Of The Westies"", was never released as a single in North America, but is included here. On the other hand, ""Good-Bye Norma Jean"", from 1973's ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" double-album, is nowhere to be found despite being twice released as a single in the mid-70's. Overall a fairly solid collection of John/Taupin pop melodies. Though not as cohesive and hit-filled as his first Greatest Hits album, it is miles above the morose, and self-absorbed songs which his third volume of Greatest Hits is mostly comprised of."
1,Meltin' Yawn,"Fraudulent ""rocker"" Elton continues on his journey to the land of Yuckville with yet another collection of the most ""worn out their welcome"" tunes ever to land radio play. Who in their right mind would put this on at home and listen to it, when you can turn on any classic rock or '80s nostalgia radio station and hear these tired tracks any time of day or night? Boring boring boring."
5,Good training book,"Written in an easy-to-understand straightforward style. Although the book focuses on Paso Finos, much of the training is applicable to any horse. Should be republished as printing is in a rather dated style."
3,"Good book, bad format","The book itself is excellent - it gives detailed information on the way a crime lab works. Unfortunately, it's very hard to actually read; the margins are terrible, with the internal margins going right into the spine. Breaking the spine is a requirement to read the book.If an electronic copy is available, I would recommend buying that instead."
3,Not the best compilation available,"There are several Angel compilations Cds available. This one is not bad by any means, but the best by far is ""Angel: The Collection"", which has a better selection of songs, and excellent sound quality. Unfortunately, this CD cannot immediately be found with a search under ""Angel"". Instead, a search under ""Angel Collection"" should identify it. For those unfamiliar with the band, Angel began by playing progressive metal in the 1970s, later evolving to a more commercial sound."
4,Outstanding,"I have always loved this group. Greg Guiffria is brilliant and vastly underrated....... Does anyone know where I can get a copy of the CD ""Knockin On Heaven's Door"" by the group ""Heaven"" w/Mitch Perry...?"
2,Barrons CHSPE book,This book is good to find out how ready you are for the test and teach you what you need to know. One thing i did not like about this book is that it has a lot of errors with the answers on the test that it gives. It was very frusterating and I thought it could of been better. Thats why i gave it a low rating.
3,"Funny, but needs SKILL!!!","There are some music artists out there who know what they're doing, and there are some who don't. Al is right in between them."
3,"Good overview, but has a few [gripes]","""Superman on Television"" is a good review of Superman's golden years on TV (1953-57). Each episode has a meticulous summary and some ratings from the author.What is NOT needed are the [gripes] against liberals and environmentalists that are sprinkled here and there. If I want to read attacks on these groups, I'll read National Review, not a book on Superman.Marginally recommmended."
3,"Important Play, Dry Read","It is undeniable that J.M. Synge was a very important Irish playwright of the early 20th century. These plays, especially, ""Playboy of the Western World,"" are pivotal to Irish literature, and now, Irish culture. Any serious student of British drama, or actor should read both of these plays.On the other hand, it may not be an ideal idea for someone that does not fall into one of those two catagories. The dialectic style is very thick, and at times difficult to understand. ""Playboy,"" an important (and early) Irish peasant drama is beautifully writen, but for a casual reader it would probably come off as a slow read that is not all that entertaining.Important work from cultural and recent historical perspectives, but these plays are very dated and, as I mentioned, not the most entertaining read."
4,A gem worth reading AND seeing,"Synge is tremendous--and tremendously funny. ""Playboy"" especially is a great play of mistaken identity. And if you ever get a chance to see it (by actors with legitimate Irish accents), it is worth seeing."
5,Loved this book!,"I first heard Hans Holzer interviewed on Whitley Streiber's radio show ""Dreamland"" on the subject of life after death. Holzer chose Philip Solomon as the medium to contact the dead as he is one of the most accurate mediums in the world. Holzer states that this book is the first time a methodical question-and-answer approach about life on the Other Side has been attempted, especially by a parapsychologist and a medium. What a great comfort this books was for me after losing a loved one 8 months ago.It was informative, full of interviews with famous people, such as Princess Diana, Elvis, and the not-so-famous giving us a glimpse of what does on in the Other Side, the type of reality that is experienced there, and that life continues on after death."
1,"If you are a serious student of mediumship, don't buy this!","When I looked inside at the T.O.C. for a quick read before buying, I should have known then that it is absolutely ridiculous! An interview with Hitler? Marilyn Monroe? Her so called interview starts with, ""Of course, it's so nice to talk to you - let's not go through all of that stuff about how I died again. It's time for us to move on."" Basically, the authors are not psychic, not revealing anything about anyone that is not common knowledge. For fun fiction, maybe - but NOT for a serious student of mediumship or metaphysics. Don't waste your money."
5,UNBELIEVABLE BOOK!,"I MUST SAY THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ LATELY. IT'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE CONVERSATION WITH GOD BOOKS. THIS BOOK GIVES YOU A RARE GIFT OF SEEING WHAT IT IS LIKE AFTER WE CROSS OVER. THIS BOOK IS BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE CROSSED OVER AND GIVES YOU A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHAT ITS LIKE IN THE SPIRITUAL REALM. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE CROSS OVER AND WHAT WE WILL SEE AND EXPERIENCE. IT IS TRULY AN EXCEPTIONAL BOOK. I PERSONALLY HAVE BOUGHT SIX COPIES AND GIVE THEM OUT TO FRIENDS AS GIFTS. THERE ARE ALSO SOME INTERVIEWS WITH CELEBRITIES THAT HAVE CROSSED OVER LIKE; ELVIS, MONROE, JUDY GARLAND, DIETRICH PRINCESS DI AND EVEN AL CAPONE AND HITLER. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK HIGHLY ENOUGH. THE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED BY A GIFTED TRANCE MEDIUM PHILIP SOLOMON. PLEASE DONT PASS ON THIS ONE. GOD BLESS, SCOTT...P.S. IM NOT RELATED TO THE AUTHOR ALTHOUGH WE HAVE THE SAME LAST NAME."
3,Channelled Minor Entities from the Beyond.,"A typical Hans Holzer book of which he has pronounced the complete authenticity and veracity of the author, a young English native. I am well-read in the Seth and Abraham material, as well as others, and feel that the material within the book may well be authentic. The author has the enviable ability to easily contact many spirit entities, mostly those of the lower levels of Understanding in ""Heaven,"" such as Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, Princess Diana, Hitler and other lesser known people. A few other entities on ""Higher Levels"" also appear. Each contact appears as a brief chapter of 3-5 pages, written in a lively, down-to-earth manner and is remarkably consistent from tale tp tale, as well as with Seth & c.What is valuable in this book are the consistent descriptions of ""everyday life"" in the ""Lower Levels,"" which Seth and Abraham neglect to mention. Interesting."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....,"If Mr. Solomon is indeed a famous medium, one can only assume he is way more interesting in person than he is on the written page. This book should have been fascinating, but ended up being duller than any other ADC/medium book I have ever read. Quite honestly, I didn't even read all the chapters. I would have expired from boredom. I had to read the Hitler chapter, though...Hitler was trying hard to relay his messages to Mr. Solomon...while Mr. Solomon kept telling him he didn't wish to speak to him...even though Hitler told him that he, Mr. Solomon, was the ONLY medium he had actually EVER spoken to since his death. Such a flattering remark didn't impress the author, however...leaving one to wonder why he even put the chapter in the book in the first place. It's not like Hitler said anything remotely interesting...it's not like anyone in this book said anything remotely interesting...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
5,Entertaining and compelling book about the afterlife!,"I found this book to be very entertaining and easy to read. It is one of those books that you won't be able to put down until you're finished! Philip Soloman is a psychic able to communicate with the deceased. He interviews dozens of regular people and celebrities who have died. They provide some amusing information about life on the other site in general and some specifics (based on their experience) of the pecking order in heaven. The information presented seems logical, i.e., souls on the lower level living their life much like they do on earth and souls on the higher levels living life in a much more enlighted way. I very much enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter."
4,Recommended,I have very picky dogs and they really like this product. It is also made in the U.S. which is a big draw for me. Most dog treats come from China and I find my little Shih Tzu becomming sick on those treats. I have no trouble with these.
1,Dog Treats,"Our dog did not like these at all, wouldn't even smell them, just turned his head. Yet, my daughter's dog loved them. You never know, I guess you could say our dog is a ""picky"" eater!"
2,The smell will kill you. I thought this would b a great treat for my sisters two labs. The smell,"I thought this would be a great treat for my sisters two labs. They smell horrible and the dogs preferred their old raw hide bones over these. I now know to buy dog treats from a store. My intensions were good, but they just didn't work out!"
1,MY dogs say NO!,"My two dogs each just about anything I hand them. But after the first taste, they spit them out and walked away."
3,MUCH Bigger Than Expected.,"Be forewarned, these treats are VERY LARGE. One piece of lung is the size of my palm and almost an inch thick. I'm much more a fan of smaller treats, since my dog won't get full very quickly when I'm training him. If I gave my dog a piece of this, it's about half a meal! The picture here is deceiving. If you're fine with the large size, then rock on."
3,One dog likes one doesnt,"OK so got these not sure what they were like. I'm used to gettting pig ears which are more crunchy. I have two dogs. One just loved these the other wont do much with them. Personally, I dont think I would order them again, but would instead go back to the ears or something a little more crunchy. These are basically like 1/4"" to 1/2"" pieces of skin that have been smoked until cured. Though they are a little crunchy they are more like ummm think of a styrofoam texture.The product was well packaged and I would order from the company again, just would get something different."
5,My puppy love them,My puppy go mad for this. He loves it and unlike Liver you don't have to worry about the quantity. If you don't know it is actually lungs.
5,DOGS LOVE THEM!,"Now this SmokeHouse product my dogs can't get enough of. They would eat the entire bag in one sitting if they could. It is a very light, airy, crunchy treat...I'm not sure about how healthy they are for the dogs as the label does not give too much information detailing all the contents and how ""healthy"" they are for pets. They will make them thirsty because they are dry. No complaints on this product."
2,"Well, gone in a minute","Well, I was hoping for a treat that would last awhile. Some of the reviews indicated this. My two terriers normally savor something for a considerable period of time. They wolfed this down in a minute. I guess that's good, but I was hoping for something that would last a little while. Guess not. Will not buy again."
1,dog didn't like it,"Been using the lamb version for 11 years, and my dog loves it. Thought to try the beef treats, and she won't touch them."
3,Not the same,"This replacement carafe that has the same part number is very different and requires a totally different lid. It would have been nice it that was mentioned in the description. What is nice is the carafe is much larger than the old one, but again, a new lid is required because it doesn't come with the replacement."
1,Something's Wrong,"This is the wrong part for my machine. The tank might fit my machine, but without the lid it is usless. I threw it away the day it was delivered. I did save the cartridge."
5,Great toy boat,"Colors similar to the user picture and not the amazon stock photo. This boat is great for lil kids. Simple and perfect, just like they used to make."
5,Funk and Jump,"It's hard to typecast this grooving bunch. Those who see them live rave about them, unfortunately I'm miles (x 1000) from Texas. Pick up Private Bag and Yesterday and you won't stop listening. Not a bad track in the mix. Private Bag shows how good they are live with the second set of tunes.What more could you want? A horn section that lays a groove and smokes some tight riffs. Vocals that are spot on. Rhythm section that lays it down.Don't want to compare them because they are on their way to being incomparable! But you can hear it all from Oakland to N'awlins... and then some."
4,Live,This band is amazing live. The groove and the vibe that they set is radiating in any atmosphere. I strongly recommend seeing this band live.
3,There is a Better Version,"I bought both ""Africa Unite"" (1997) and their album, ""Mmalo-We"" (1993). Much of the material on Mmalo-We is remixed on Africa Unite. One of the reviews mentions hearing the song, Mmalo-We on a Starbucks compilation (Starbucks Hits - Africaffe). That version of the song, Mmalo-We is on the album Mmalo-We and NOT the version found on the album, Africa Unite.A good album, but much of the music is presented in a superior mix on their album, Mmalo-We."
4,Good Soulful Afro Pop,I Remember hearing a track at Starbucks of the least to say. But hey it has opened my mind more to African music so much that I wrote down the name of the artist and furthur looked it up and soon found it on tape cassette( When they still made cassettes). Love this album since it has brought up my spirits. Great to play at the rise of your morning. IRie? Yes!
1,"Not unpleasant, but not the Nylons","If you want a CD of very ordinary, though pleasant Christmas music done in a basically elevator-music style, you may like this album. If you love the Nylons, as you are accustomed to hearing them on albums such as One Size Fits All, you'll wonder who the heck is singing. Only Carol of the Bells is actually done as the Nylons do what they do; the rest are very generic, stereotypical light-jazz treatments with lots of over-sweetened strings in the backgrounds. The accapella work and sense of rhthym and excitement that make the Nylons so wonderful are missing, except for Carol of the Bells."
3,Not a very exciting CD,This album features none of the great stuff these guys can do with harmonies and percussive vocalisations. It is pretty much a series of solo performances of very standard arrangements of Christmas tunes. I don't recommend it unless you want the traditional xmas muzak.
5,Lovely Book!,What wonderful illustration! This book is a must have for any young child. Suzy Spafford has done it agian! Bravo!
4,"Reeves, villain???","George Reeves had not yet been typecast. The Pine-Thomas production unit for Paramount Pictures had been very active and profitable. ""Special Agent"" starred a soon to be legendary George Reeves as one of the Deveraux brothers who had just pulled off a big time payroll heist, come up against Johnny Douglas (William Eythe) special agent of the combined railroads. This film is action packed, and almost totally filmed 'live', adding realism to the photography. It is a decent film that Reeves made around the same time as Sir Galahad pre Superman.If you ever manage to find a copy, snag it. You will not be disappointed."
1,lousy picture quality,"WARNING: like the most DVD of this label, the picture Quality is LOUSY. I could not watching it for 5 minute. Sorry. Even you're a hardcore George Reeves or William Eythe Fan. Also the sound is terrible."
1,Bostitch tnails and nailgun,"I'm very disappointed with the lack of information provided for quantity of tnails in the purchase.The 5/8"" tnails were $40 and then when the 3/4"" ones were $115 I assumed the quantity would be more but it was the same amount.Secondly, I also bought the nail gun for the t nails and when I attempted to shoot theese nails into concrete they just bent and didn't penetrate the concrete so I had to use my 22 caliber fasteners anyway.so I spent hundreds of $$$ for nothing."
5,THE BEST FATHER&SON BLUES ALBUM EVER!!,"I BOUGHT THE ALBUM FIRST SOMETIME IN THE 1980'S AND THEN THE CD WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. FATHER JOHNNY OTIS ON PIANO AND DRUMS, SON SHUGGIE OTIS ON GREAT LEAD GUITAR, ALONG WITH OTHER FINE PLAYERS. THE BEST BLUES ALBUM OF 1969 IN MY VIEW."
3,Not as good as I thought,"Ive read Countess Below Stairs a hundred times and it's one of my favourite books ever, so when I bought this one I thought it would be as good as that one. But it wasnt. It was kind of boring. I enjoyed, it was good to spend the time, but it was not so great."
2,abridged...disappointed,"While the narration was great, I didn't realize the book was abridged. There is soooooooooo much of this delicious story missing. Disappointed."
3,"Great Characters, okay storyline","This book was my least favorite out of all Ms.Ibbotson's books. I couldnt keep my attention and the ended was kinda boring. Although i like the lead male, the main character really annoyed me. I don't think we found out what her true character is. The storyline and plot confused me cause it jumped around. I forgot who the people were most of the time. I really didnt like the storyline. I found it kind of boring. Though it wasnt predictable, I was confused on what was happening. If you want a good read, read Countess Below Stairs, The morning Gift, or a companny of swans. (that's in order ffrom my most favorite!)"
5,funny and enlightening,"Some of the characters in this book were funny to read about. The descriptions and scenarios that some of them were in were on point. Jane't is as real as a b*tch can come. I liked that wonderwoman part. That was funny as hell! This book is better than A Hustlers Wife. Don't Knock The Hustle is way more realistic. I enjoyed this book and best yet, I got the chance to talk to Stacy. If you ever read these reviews Stacy, you are a baaaad b*tch!"
3,Not Bad!!!!!!!,"I read about 2-3 books a week, and while I was giving this new author a try i fell for the book. It was indeed very real and you could relate to some of the characters. However, the ending just made me mad. The book was so good til it got to the last 20 pages. the ending could have been better, and I'm waiting for part two. Please don't turn out to be a dud, we're all pulling for you."
4,A Great Read,When I saw this book I wondered who is Stacy Nelson. I like reading books about the streets and I am glad I got this one. What makes it even better is the fact that this is an writer I can actually talk to. With more development of the characters in this book it would be even better. In comparison to A Hustler's Wife or Bad Girlz or True To The Game this book was more real than all of those books put together. I enjoyed this book and Stacy please bring the sequel out soon!
3,A bit of fun. A bit of lore.,"I actually came upon this book today while I was working at a small bookstore and I had to buy it because I realized that I was flipping through it and creasing the binding. I took it home and had it read before my nightly activities. There were some parts that I couldn't keep from laughing outloud and other parts that lost my attention: as with sex, I guess. I suggest this book for any person who has an interest in sex. Ha. Great demographic, at least, to those people who want something with some shock value on their bookshelves: nothing can beat a bright pink book with the big black block letters of S-E-X ringing lound and clear for all to see!"
3,She's written better,"First off, I LOVE this series. However, the plot in this one isn't very good. One of the things I love about this series is watching the characters grow. They definitely grow in this one, and I was thrilled that Mavis finally had her baby. If you want character development, this book is well worth it. But the plot was a let down.Additionally, I also LOVE Susan Erickson's narration. I started listening to this series on the way to work, and I don't think I could go back to the written page, she is so good."
1,You have to be kidding me!,"This was my first (and probably last) Nora Roberts novel. I certainly don't see the attraction to this author and why she has sold so many books. The characters are so one-dimensional. Transitioning from scene to scene and scene breaks in general are terrible. The same with transitioning the dialog from one character to another. Of course, the conversation was the equivalent of cave men grunting; I have a hard time believing that educated people talk like this. The love scenes -- horrid -- made me want to skip over them. The first half of the book was totally boring with Eve doing too much rationalization instead of detective work. Too many unexplained anacronyms. But, she did get the spelling of e-mail correct!"
3,An Okay Read - Hope next book is better.,"I have always enjoyed J.D.Robb's mysteries, but I was a bit disappointed in this novel.I did enjoy Mavis and the birth of her child. I thought the scene had a humorous touch which was refreshing. I thought the plot for the most part was weak. Some parts held my attention, but overall I thought it could have been developed better. I'll probably buy Nora's next novel ""Innocent in Death"" with a view towards it being a better than ""Born in Death"". I hope so."
4,Keep 'em coming!,"Although this was not my favorite of the ""IN DEATH"" series I still enjoyed it. I think JD Robb strung it along too much before what I and many others were waiting for...that being the birth of Mavis' baby and Eve and Roarke's reactions/feelings about it all.I read this book really fast just to get to the end which was the best part. Nevertheless I did enjoy it and eagerly await the next in the series due out in a few weeks!"
3,Series is getting tired....,"The series is becoming too predictable. While reading this book on an airplane, I kept thinking, haven't I read this before? The dialogue feels like it was picked up from another one of the ""In Death"" series and woven together to create a new book. The flashbacks to Eve and Roarke's childhoods are becoming trite and maudlin. I read very quickly just to get to Mavis's baby being born, which of course is at the end of the book. Don't think I'll be reading more of this series."
5,Fabulous service,"I ordered my books, not only were they less expensive than the retail stores, but I had them sooner, than the guarantee. The only problem was that I read them so fast, the author hasn't had a chance to write More!"
3,Abridged Too Far (Abridged CD),Nora wrote a good story. What was read was well read on the CD. Unfortunately so much was removed that the story made no sense. People who appeared in a short sentence at the beginning turned out to have a crucial role. A large part of the conclusion was removed. The CD was a waste of money. I bought and read the hardback. That was a good book.
3,What's the hurry Nora?,"A long time fan of Eve and Rourke, I could not wait for this book to come out. Unfortunately, I felt let down. The plot while gripping in some parts, was rushed. After so many books, there are now a whole host of characters that we are familiar with but there is no need to trot out so many in one book. And what's with this CSI like dovetail convergence of 2 cases? Plot lines running dry? As much as I love the series and can't wait to get my hands on the next book, I would rather they come out at a slower rate but be more polished."
1,she does it again,"If you're a Nora Roberts addict, this book will give you your fix. She spins her usual good yarn, sadly, as always, there's no character development, a lot of redundancy. However, again as always, and isn't this why we read her--there is a Happy Ending."
5,I love this series,"I know when I pick up a new book in this series that I am going to enjoy reading the book. What else can you want from a series?I don't think I've reviewed any of the earlier books, but I've just finished reading this one, and wanted to share how I felt. This is one of those series where you care about the back story and the major continuing characters as much as you care about the mystery. This book moves that back story along. You discover a lot about all of the continuing characters and their strengths and weaknesses. That is part of the charm of the series.You also have a very interesting mystery to deal with. Or rather a pair of mysteries that could not be solved if what looked like two different mysteries were not being worked by the same person.You are going to enjoy this."
5,Robb again...yea!,"Once again we are able to enter the realm of Rourke, Eve, Mavis, etal. You don't realize how much you love and miss these characters until you are once again immersed in their world! A great mystery, as usual, and Mavis has her baby! A quick read, as always, and leaves you waiting for the next installment."
4,ANOTHER BULLSEYE FOR NORA!,"I could not wait for this book to hit the shelves. I have read every book in this series, and this rates in the top 6. The first chapter was so funny and absolutely in character for Eve and Roarke. A few of the middle chapters were a little Ho Hum but on the whole a great read. I know very few authors who stay as true to their characters as J.D. Robb[a.k.a. Nora Roberts] does and yet they are never stale. That is what will keep me looking forward to the next ""..In Death"" book."
2,Did someone else write this book?,"I LOVE J.D. Robb books but Born in Death just felt like someone else wrote this book. The writing style of not the same as the previous books. In the other books Nora doesn't use words like addy, vid, wit ALL the time and there is wayyyy too much description of what people Eve is interviewing have on. I felt that this book was not up to her usual HIGH standards and was very disappointed because I had waited so long. I will continue to read all of Nora Roberts books and will hope that she returns to her usual style of writing."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"In preparation for the (very) long awaited release of ""Born in Death,"" I had re-read the series. Unfortunately, re-reading the older books was more entertaining than was the original reading of this one. I had wished otherwise. ::sigh::"
3,fair,Book was shipped quickly. There was cracking and damage to the spine. Indside was in good shape.
1,"Big, predictable disappointment","The complete lack of a convincing mystery could be forgiven because everyone who reads this series has been salivating for the birth of Mavis' baby. I had been especially looking forward to this because Mavis is my favorite character. However, Nora Roberts disappoints in a huge way. She opted for no originality and instead pulled out every predictable heart tugging moment ever written.I felt like I was reading an episode of All My Children"
1,Born in Death,"I would really have liked to have listened to this audio book while driving. Unfortunately, it can only be heard on a computer, therefore, the only thing I can say about this product is that I would have really liked to have had the information before ordering.Compulsive Reader"
4,"Murder of horror, with a dash of love and happiness","The female cop, Eve Dallas, who lives to solve hideous crimes of murder, finds herself working up to a nervous breakdown over the idea of being her best friend's coach through the birth of her child. Between dreaded birthing classes, Eve is working on a double murder committed by unspeakable civilized people who are driven to insanity by the power of greed. In the mist of all this horror and death, is the miracle of life. I gave Nora 4 stars on this one because there were many areas where the story line seemed to drag. However, the ending was a show stopper, leaving you with a good feeling about it all.Marty WurtzAuthor of Deceptions and Betrayals"
4,It wasn't bad,"I have to say that this wasn't one of my favorites, but I think it was me, and not what Nora wrote. I just couldn't get into the plot until about halfway through. I tried. I read the first few chapters and put it down for MONTHS. I thought maybe I was distracted, but when I started it over a few days ago, I just realized that the subject matter was dry to me. Hard to get started.I loved the personal dramas, as I always do, and the scenes in the delivery room were great, as were the tense scenes between Eve/Roarke/Whitney. She handled that really well.I had this one figured out early on, but I do with some of them. This just wasn't my favorite, but it was still good."
4,Pretty good mystery,"This as all the books in the series was enjoyable if I forget the ""futuristic"" element which is quite silly. The renaming of current things like cell for ""pocket link"" as an example doesn't show much imagination. Moreover, the fashions seem more today than tomorrow! Even though the merging of the 2 cases in the novel is a ""little"" unbelievable, it is a pretty good mystery story and the relationships between the diverse characters is fun."
4,Useful for the novice.,"As someone who is not already well-read on the subject, this was a very handy introduction. I'm sure that it is of limited value to someone already versed in the subject, and I admit to wishing that it had not started with William the Conqueror; I don't know much about it, but I DO know that there were Kings in England before 1066. But it does what it sets out to do well: a brief recitation of the Kings and Queens since the Norman Conquest, with a bit of detail about each."
4,Good springboard into British history,"My dad gave me this lovely book for Christmas back in '99, and I have used it as a reference ever since. Although it is a splendid read from cover-to-cover, I find that it is one of the best books out there to really whet the appetite for more in-depth research into the monarch, rebel or time period of your choice.The genealogy charts are fun to puzzle out, and the illustrations, including coats of arms, maps, tapestries and portraits, add extra personality to the history, which is, in itself, fascinating.Of course, a book of this length only scratches the surface of the noble, scandalous, shocking and never-dull lives of the British monarchs, their families, friends and enemies, so you must dig deeper if any one subject appeals to you. All in all, a well-written, organized and illustrated overview of a sizeable chunk of history."
4,Interesting overwiew,Well written and documented overwiewBut it lacks a bibliography for further reading
3,Content....,"It is an interesting book but very short on detail. Altogether, it is more of a book of reference in case you read other books about kings and queens of england."
4,Entertaining and Informative,"I love this book. Even with all of the reading I have done on the British Monarchy, this book had never before seen pictures. My only complaint would be that it often focuses more on political events rather than personal lives. But, there is wonderful information in this book, and I have enjoyed every page."
4,Love her voice! Can listen to it when you're at the gym...,"I am really enjoying the CDs. The only downside is that they stop the individual tracks at strange places, sometimes in the middle of a king or queen. I imagine it would be good for a car ride - so far, I've listened while doing laundry or at the gym."
4,Nice overview,"This is book gives a brief but useful history of every English monarch over the past millenium. I knew very little about the monarchy before reading the book, and this was a perfect introduction. This book would also probably be helpful for those who want a refresher in their history or for those who are just trying to keep all of the Henrys, Georges, and Edwards straight."
4,Good overview,"Lady Antonia, daughter of the late Earl of Longford, is one of the best known popular historians working in Britain today. Though not an academic, she has developed a reputation for impartial, well considered, very well written prose. Here she oversees the contributions of a number of well-regarded historians, including John Gillingham, Neville Williams, Maurice Ashley, and John Clarke, each covering the dynasty in which they are expert. While this volume is primarily a collective royal biography, and therefore largely outside the scope of this bibliography, Fraser (presumably) has seen to it that the separate chapters emphasize the continuity of the Crown, even during periods of violent dynastic change. J. P. Brooke-Little, the Richmond Herald, also contributes occasional pages regarding the development of heraldry as displayed by England's monarchs."
4,History Thru Biography,"Until I read this book, the history of England and her monarchs was clouded in confusion. No longer! A beautiful book, full of color and informative graphics, ""Lives"" packs much information in one volume. Antonia Frazier has done a wonderful job editing the work of many authors. ""Lives"" draws the reader into the life and times of kings, queens, bas***ds, pretenders, earls, dukes and mistresses. The role and evolution of Parliment is explored, as well as brief outlines of the world at large in order to maintain historical perspective. Often the authors attempt to correct what they feel were previous historical inaccuracies and judge the reigns of each monarch. From the Norman conquest in 1066 to the present, the history of this great country (and Empire) is one we need to better understand because of England's great influence on not only the US, but the world. I can't wait to read the updated 1998 edition, which I just thumbed through at a local retailer."
5,Excellent,Great for both the student of the subject as well as the mild enthusiast. Simple to follow and understand. Comes complete with helpful lineage/geneology charts of the different dynasties. Beautiful pictures and interesting story-type verse. I wouldn't be caught dead without a copy close at hand! It helps me look up quick facts as well as learn more of the cultures of the different eras. I couldn't have survived four years of college without it!!!
3,Like having Wikepedia read to you about each King and Queen,"This book on CD is informative and may serve as a good overview, but it is like having someone read to you out of Wikepedia about each King and Queen. There are at times interisting detail, such as Willima I corpse bursting and there being a horrible stench. This book does not have that something extra that makes for good story telling. The other negative on the book is the introduction is just too long. What the book does is give a good overview of each king and queen of England."
3,"The ""Reader's Digest"" Condensed version of history","If you are a serious historian of England (as I am) then this book is almost useless. It is very simplistic and stays away from any truly controversial issues, often toeing the very traditional line (Richard III for instance--if you want a fight with a medieval English Historian, find out which side he is on the debate, then take the opposite. I have literaly seen people with a ph.d almost comming to blows over this issue). This book is a place to start, but please dig deeper."
1,"Oh My, what to do about Ken Bruen",This book is purposely gross and disgusting. It is not a stark look at the seedy side of life it IS seedy. I review books I read on Facebook for my friends and made sure to warn them off. I hope never to find another of Mr. Bruen's books in my hand.
5,To read this book is to love G. B. Hinkley,"The lives of Gordon B., and Marge Hinkley are well learning of and emulattong. Dew puts a very human face on this our Prophet."
5,Excellent reading,This book details many things I never knew about him. What a fascinating man! This book is well worth it.
4,Real good,"...but not great. The direction that The Doors were going in with their two excellent post-Morrison albums is almost gone, replaced by some cerebral and bizarre acid-jazz stylings. Sometimes it works, sometimes it goes horribly wrong, but the good moments far outweigh the bad, making Ray's album a very interesting and absorbing listen. The best cut by far in my opinion is 'The Purpose Of Existence Is?', a very ""Full Circle""- like track with marvelous lyrical wordplay and top-notch playing and production. This track alone would make THE GOLDEN SCARAB a worthwhile purchase, but the cd offers many more fascinating moments as well."
3,"A Wizard, A True Prodigy","First let me begin by saying that I've met Ray Manzarek not once but twice. I must say that he is a keyboard wizard. More prodigious keyboard playing I shall never see. This is a good CD. Not a GREAT CD but a good one. It's a conceptual album. Slightly pretentous. Best cut is ""Downbound Train"" complete with tack piano solo by Ray. Best bonus track is ""Bicentenial Blues"" from Ray's 2nd album. This cut has a WICKED organ solo by Ray a la ""Light My Fire"". Not Ray's BEST album. That was ""The Whole Thing Started with Rock & Roll Now It's Out of Control"". This is probably 2nd best."
3,strange days have found us,only listened once to it.What I remember is it is very eclectic.Like some backwoods Texas beat in a darkened starlit meteorific cosmic night.I must listen anew.
5,Oh yeah,"Excellent album, I like the percussion side of it, kind of like Calypso or salsa. And then add Ray's distinctive vocals and you have one great album."
4,"Not bad, Ray.","The best offer from the Doorsworld post Jim Morrison. A lot of this could have been qualified for a great Doorsalbum WITH Morrison and the orginal group. If that would be the case it would of course sounded better. But here is much musical ingredients that shows it was not too long ago sience Manzarek was a Door. The sound, the songs."
4,Pleasant Romantic Adventure,"This is a very pleasant romantic adventure--easy to read, full of sexual tension and moving. The hero John Henry and heroine Pip rediscover a deep passion and love for one another through becoming surrogate parents for an unfortunate newborn. This situation becomes increasingly complex, sensual and involving. Pip has a satisfying spiritual enlightenment at the end. Enthusiastically recommended."
4,Great twist on a tried and true.,"Pip Merriem lands herself in a pile of trouble when she finds she is stuck up the Nile River with a friend in the throes of a difficult labor. When she sends for help, the last person she expects to come to her rescue is her childhood friend John Henry Lovell. He is equally stunned to find himself summoned to help the woman he has loved since childhood and whom he fled to India to escape. Determining to wed to protect the now orphaned child and Pip's reputation, the couple is put in close proximity and must face their emotions, past and present.Katherine Kingsley has taken the much clichéd forced marriage scenario and breathed new life in to it. The glory of ancient Egypt comes alive through Pip's love of the civilization. Suppressed passion flares between the couple, manifesting itself as temper. It is this volatile history shared by Pip and John Henry that makes this story such a commanding read."
1,A disappointment from Katherine Kingsley,"I have read all of Kingsley's previous books and enjoyed them, but this one was just dreadful. Both of the characters were unpleasant and unattractive. There was too much back story between when they were presented as children in a previous book and their subsequent meeting in Egypt. Moreover, the circumstances behind their second meeting in Upper Egypt were absolutely preposterous. Kingsley's presentation of Egypt was incorrect in many aspects. Instead of researching the country, she appears to have simply read a number of the (very good) Elizabeth Peters Amelia Peabody books.It's a shame that when an author becomes successful, her editors don't feel the need to continue doing their work and pointing out flaws."
2,What a chauvinistic book,"The tension and conflict between the characters makes for a powerful emotional chemistry, which kept this book interesting most of the time. However, what bothered me was the unusual resolution of conflict: that Pip should discover how flawed her character is, obey John Henry, and apologize. Once or twice, John Henry briefly apologizes, but only after Pip confesses and apologizes repentantly first. Never mind that John Henry's deception caused many of their problems. Worse still, in the book's final happily-ever-after scenes, John Henry admonishes Pip to ""behave"" for the sake of their future. What an uneven and unfair resolution! I've never read so chauvinistic a book."
2,Fairy Tale,"Somewhere in my youth, I've read this story as a fairy tale, but I can't remember where. Of course, back then, it was without sex and it was so much better.Pip was nothing but a spoiled, lazy woman. She was made out to be such a good mother, but yet she let her maid raise the child. Every single time she got a little tired, she let poor Aaefth finish her mess without one thought that poor old Aaefth was probably worn out.Why in the world John Henry loved her so much was a wonder to me. She didn't deserve him.Ms Kinglsey is a good writer. I just wish she would either write novels or fairy tales and not combine the two."
5,Don't miss this one,"This modern pop/rock CD satisfies from start to finish. The songs range from mellow ballads to full-power rock, but they all have a common thread of strong lyrical and musical hooks."
3,Ok,"This book is okay. Not something I'd read for fun, by no means. It was required and I probably only read 40% of the readings."
3,A bit pricey.,Just a bit pricey. Ended up spending about $500 on cables for my HT system. There has to be a better way to get good cables.
5,oh my god... so good...,"I like this book... a lot, especially the last few chapters. This book covers a lot of topics. A lot. Each chapter is only a few pages long, which is nice for people who don't chunks of time to read. Everything he says builds up to the last chapter. It's eloquently written and a fun/easy/intellectual read."
2,A rollercoaster!,"I felt that this book was good at some points and horrible at others. A few of the essays are interesting and you can easily draw similarities. Then others are ridiculous and you spend more time with a dictionary than you do with the book and you'd have to read it over 5 times to get just a general idea.So, I suggest that if you like challenging reading and science that you buy the book, but if you are like me and HATE science and just enjoy a good book, you look elsewhere!"
4,An interesting book by any measure,"Look, it's not as smooth a read as Microcosmos--BUT, it is very interesting, and would make an excellent follow up to Margullis and Sagan's book Microcosmos. This book gets a bit farther into the development of human sexual traits than Microscosmos (of course, one can and should buy a copy of ""What is Sex"" by Margullis and Sagan if they are that curious) However, it reflects well on both books should they be read back to back as I have. It is difficult for a person like me--with a limited understanding of cell biology---to find easily understood books on the subject. This is one. I highly recomend Thomas' book to anyone who wants to understand the biology of humanity."
4,Critical Review from a Biochemist,"I remember reading this book when I first began my undergraduate career in biochemistry (2008). As a current PhD student (2012), I look back on this book with fondness. It is written well and was an easy read for a young scientist. I actually had the chance to re-read this book earlier this year and surprisingly I was still intellectually stimulated by it's content. Overall, the book is well written and would be appreciated by anybody who has at least a general interest in biology. I probably would recommend this to the average student who remembers bio class as ""that tortuous hour three times a week"" but I would suggest it to anyone interesting in or studying science."
5,Delightful,"Beautiful and engaging prose. Illuminating. Great for family reading. One of those volumes that after reading for the first time, one wonders why the book hadn't been read before."
5,Still powerful.,"The Lives of a Cell ages well. I reread it now and then; in all these years, the power hasn't faded. Lewis Thomas provokes the reader into an active thinking mode, but he pushes thinking into a form of inspiration, and profound joy."
5,I can't believe that guy said that,"This CD is fantastic...Morton Feldman is one of the best composers of the 20th century. This CD presents a nice slice of his more easily digestable works (which means, works that are under 4 hours long). ""Rothko Chapel"" should be pop music."
4,Don't bother reading reviews: just buy it!,"even if you think you have all the Hound Dog you need, you need this disc. Stop reading and order it. (I gave it only 4 stars because a) most of the material is available elsewhere, and b) there's always room for improvement.)"
5,Beware of the Dog,I have a collection of about 300 blues cd's and this is one of the grittiest of my entire collection. He doesn't make it sound pretty or even clean. This is the straight dirty stuff. His energy and enthusiasm for the blues makes him one of my most favorite artists. Definitely an essential for everyones collection.
5,One of the Best,"I liked this CD. Hound Dog Taylor at his best. The songs on this CD are traditional Hound Dog Taylor. If you like the blues, you'll like this CD."
5,Close up lens kit +1+2+4,"I bought this 55 mm Close up lens kit for my Fuji FinePix S5200 Digital Camera. The +1+2+4 Macro lens kit for mixing and matching different Close up magnifications up to +7.They are great for photographing coins, flowers, print material or anything close up pretty much. Get great looking, clear shots with a tripod of course and good lighting. Good lens kit for the price.I personally use a real mild filter most of the time just to give a little more enhancement to the shot.For the price these are great lenses."
5,Reminds me of another Collins..... Tommy,"The Bakersfield sound is all over this disc, not just Merle and Buck, but the driving heartbreak of Wynn Stewart and the songwriting sophistication of Tommy Collins. Much as Buck and Merle got their starts playing with and learning from these late 50's talents, Stacie's sound takes their distinctive style and expands it. Shame that country radio doesn't pay attention anymore. To anyone who recognizes the name Dale Watson; you need this disc. To those who don't but wish they could find someone else who blends old and new like Dwight, you just did."
4,Insightful fiction about Kosovo for children and YA,"This is an excellent introduction for children about the recent struggles in Kosovo. The heart-wrenching account of Zana and her family during the volatile period surrounding the war in Kosovo, should draw interest and concern to the children reading this book. The story is based on an actual family as described in the ""author's note."" I wish a map of the area was included with the place names as a reference. Most children are probably unaware of the unfortunate violence in Kosovo's history. The story is a page-turner and a building block to learn more about current events. A good modern realism for children and young adults."
3,"good plot, poorly written","I picked this book up at a bookstore because I am Albanian myself and wanted to know more about the conflict in Kosovo. This book has a good plot, Zana, an Albanian girl, witnesses the hatred targeted towards her and other Albanians in Kosovo by the Serbs. Even after they have killed her father and two brothers, she tries to remember what her father told her before he was killed, ""Don't let them fill your heart with hate"". And to make the story more interesting, Zana has a Serbian friend. However, Alice Mead's writing style is very amateur. Even after Zana's father and brothers were killed, she doesn't slow the story down. It seems like she is trying to hurry the story along."
5,Simply excellent!,"I loved this book. Alice Mead writes passionately as Zana. And if you like this book, you'll love Zlata's Diary!"
4,Good for Highschool age reader,This was shorter that I expected. It seemed the Author rushed the story. Reading it you know there is SO much more to the story and are left wondering what else was going on.
3,Perhaps I am old-fashioned but...,"This set is definitely for Weird Al fans out there. I personally can listen through all of the songs a few times, but it gets a bit repititious. Weird Al is very talented and very funny, but for a more witty and timeless I recommend the Remains of Tom Lehrer. You can listen to that over and over and over again, always getting more out of it than you did before."
4,Great Novelty,"I am a child of the 1980s and grew up watching Weird Al. Unfortunately, people who did not grow up with him don't understand. I even have the honor of saying I saw him live...and his live show is truly that...a show. Great costumes with great novelty songs.This box set is a compilation of his early stuff in the 80s (his greatest period) to the early 90s. If you hate Weird Al, then don't even try. But if you love him, this would probably be the only CD set you need."
3,HATS OFF TO PRODUCER MICHAEL LLOYD...,"... for being able to record great-sounding pop tunes with someone of limited singing ability - Leif's covers of ""The Wanderer"", ""Runaround Sue"" and ""Surfin' USA"" still remain the definitive versions to date... with no less than four hit singles from his self-titled debut (an extremely rare feat back in the 70's - Fleetwood Mac's ""Rumours"" is the only other that comes to mind), it should have been released in its entirety. As for this collection, there isn't much to it once you get past the material from the debut recording."
1,Get real folks!,"Lief Garrett was just another in an endless line of pretty boy teeny boppers with little in the way of discernible talent who cashed in big for a brief period on the marketing of crass record companies. While there are those who might have fond memories of this pap from their childhood's, to give this drivel 5 stars here in the year 2000 is laughable at best, and downright scary at worst. Leave this back in the late 70's where it belongs. It is time to move on."
1,Leif Garrett is another bad example here!,"Get a life these teen idol actors who became television & movie performers to their credits did'nt have a chance for any musical background talent back in the seventies. To overcome for who they were like John Travolta, Shaun or David Cassidy. Just don't bother with their music they all sound terrible as rock stars. Bad career opition choice guys should've sticked to acting instead of a singing profession!"
1,He wasn't made for dancing ... or singing,"After reading several of the top rated reviewers here, I think it's time someone outside his family, or the people who work at his record company, had a say.This album is complete tripe. He can't sing or dance. Still, he blows David Hasslehoff out of the water at least!"
5,Excellent CD,I have been a huge Leif fan for about 24 years now. I guess that makes me 34 years old. I even bought 2 copies of this CD in case I wear one out. I even helped with the VH1 show and my name is in the credits at the end of the show. I look forward to Leif's new CD coming out the beginning of the new year.
1,Book feels unfinished.,"While the artwork is good, many pages have what look like characters were removed from a background by someone with bad photoshop skills. I kept turning the pages thinking ""Is this a joke?"" Why a publisher would put this out is beyond me.Again, this isn't a critique of the art itself, just the half-baked unfinished feel of the content in what should be a very nice book. Purchase something else."
4,Worth every cent,"The better of his 2 books. Truly a confident fantasy artist with a unique style. Very inspirational a must for any art book collector. His exploration of form and the illusion of tendons, fat, muscle and steel are perfect, His ability to combine so many different creatures aspects fluently together is truly amazing. This is a book I turn to when inspiration has left me."
5,extraordinary talent,"I knew before i purchased this book that I enjoyed Carlos Huante's work - now I am a dedicated fan. I first noticed a couple of his pieces in spectrum 11, and it piqued my curiosity. There's little in the way of writing, just a quick synopsis of the artist's Bio, and some working techniques.. also a few blurbs about some of his original paintings towards the end. But honestly , most of the images don't need explanation as they seem to be the work of pure imagination. Solid anatomy, shading and subtle color usage characterize the creatures and characters that populate the pages. This book is a must - have for any aspiring concept or character artist!"
1,Didn't work for me!!!,I was hopeful but this item did not work for me at all. Ended up giving them away!!! I tried them consistently for several days with no results. I mean no results so these were a NO for me!!!
5,love it!,"Elton John at his best! Love this CD, will be getting other greatest hits from him as well. Has a lot of popular songs from his earlier stuff."
5,Elton John - Greatest Hits,"I am a major Elton John fan, and this is by far one of his best albums ever, second only to Yellow Brick Road - his Best! If you are unfimilar with his work, this is a good one to start with."
4,greatest?,I only bought this C.D. for Crocodile Rock. I think there should have been a better selection on this C.D. considering the musical genius we're dealing with. I KNOW these aren't his greatest hits; We're talking Elton...c'mon!
1,Elton John,"This item was supposed to be Elton John's Greatest Hits...well, the CD case was Elton John, but the CD was ABBA!"
5,BEAUTIFUL SONGCRAFT,"All Elton John's early 70s masterpieces are collected here, from the elegant and sensitive Your Song and Daniel to the bouncy Honky Cat and the fast-paced Crocodile Rock. Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting is a rocker in similar vein, while Rocket Man and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road are beautiful ballads. Plus the famous Candle In The Wind which had many incarnations - this is the original, but there was a 1988 version too and of course, the Diana adaptation which by now must be the biggest selling single of all time. Although Elton John has created an impressive body of work in the years since, I still consider these songs to be his best. They hold a special emotional appeal for me. I know Your Song has been covered by many other artists but I'm surprised that not more of these elegantly crafted songs have been interpreted and taken up the charts by others."
5,Simply Fantastic - Elton at his best,"WOW!!! Thats definetly the way to start describing this greatest hits album. Every song truly is one great hit after the other. It starts off with the classic, your song, moves through his incredible hits like honky cat, rocket man, benny and the jets, and my favorite, goodbye yellow brick road. Along with great songs, daniel, border song, saturday nights allright for fighting, crocodile rock,and dont let the sun go down on me, this album is the best of the best in my opinion. Elton hit is prime early and has carried his career on to be one of the greatest of all time"
5,Classic.,"This album is simply that. A classic. For me, ""Rocket Man"" and ""Honky Cat"" are the highlights, but overall the album is teriffic. Elton's melodies and voice are in fine form, and Bernie knows how to write lyrics. Highly recommended!"
5,Every song a classic,"This is one of the best Greatest Hits packages released by any artist. Every song is a genuine classic. The titles here represent the best of the early Elton years when his voice was at its apex and Bernie's lyrics spoke to your heart and soul.""Daniel"" remains one of the great songs written in the last thirty years. You can listen to this song 10,000 times and never weary of it. None of these songs are dated, they stand up beautifully through the years. If you are a teenager or someone who has never sampled Elton's early work, this is *the* CD to purchase, it will confirm to you that Elton John was a genius!"
5,the best from the man,"this for me is the peak of elton john's genius.these songs hold up far better than many of the songs he has out today.the written,playing and vocals of elton on this disc are timeless.it's a must have.i like other things by the man but for me this best captures his talent."
5,The Great Elton,"Elton John is talented as hell. I like his early work the best. And this is what this album contains. Here he is in his most energetic, direct, and involved. I think it is typical for artists to be this way in their twenties. This album is absolutely great."
4,It is cute!,I just bought this for my daughter and it is pretty cute. I love how she can learn all the old Sunday school songs from when I was a child. It shows lots of children in the video. It is not a very long video but long enough for my daughter. You can't do much better for $7I can't give it the 5 stars because I can only give that to Hillsongs Kids praise DVDs so far - you need to check them out!
3,Juice of the '80s,"""Dirty Looks"" is a good album, with solid, if unexceptional, songs and performances. The album was produced exceptionally well by Richard Landis. The arrangements are 1980s high tech, heavy on synthesizers, so it does sound somewhat dated today. Juice, in my opinion, excels when she is surrounded in musical settings that are simpler, and more roots-oriented.The cassette does not contain any credits for songwriters or musicians, so musical context is missing from the cassette version.Program: ""Dirty Looks,"" ""Tell Her No,"" ""Til I Loved You,"" ""Keeping Me On My Toes,"" ""Twenty Years Ago,"" ""Don't Bother Me,"" ""Stranger At My Door,"" ""Slipping Away,"" ""Runaway Hearts,"" ""For Believers."""
5,Exquisite!!,"From the moment My Garden Visits arrived at my door and I lifted the book from the box, I was taken. The beauty of the book first captivated me. It was through that very window on the cover that I was able to view a beautiful glimpse of a woman's life told with admiration by her son. Author Justin Matott will take you along to his gardens that are filled with flowers and plants which spark memories of his childhood. He allows you to sit on the teak bench with his mother where she came to visit him after her death. It is these visits that the author so lovingly describes in stories from his past. My Garden Visits is truely a pleasure to read. This wonderfully written book will be in the hands of many I hold dear as I share it this holiday season . They too, will step into the wondorus gardens so exquisitely described by Justin and enjoy the divine watercolors by Illustrator Victoria Kwasinski which adorn the pages."
5,This book touched my soul!,"My Garden Visits offers us a glimpse of love beyond death. Love never dies and Mr. Matott tells his story with strength and tenderness. If you have lost someone you love, this book will give you tears of joy as you remember!"
5,awesome!,"Many people favor gardening as a form of recreation; for others, the opportunity to commune with nature imparts to gardening an almost meditative character. For the author, a third dimension makes an even bigger impact in an unexpected series of visitations from his late, beloved mother, at times just seeking his companionship, and at others bearing specific messages from God to be more attentive to his family and form a closer bond with his father. This is a risky mix that might turn maudlin, or worse, in lesser skilled hands. Fortunately, Matott is more than up to the challenge, and the resulting portrait of his mother adroitly mixes amateur horticulture with personal memories in a ""garden"" made almost palpable by Victoria Kwasinski's lilting watercolor illustrations."
4,Found: The Watch that I love!,"I am so glad I came to Amazon.com to look for this watch. I've been searching for it since the year started at department stores. I was given the exact same watch 2-3 years ago, as a gift, and this year, it broke. I loved the watch! The department store told me to look in the other stores, and I did, until my mom suggested Amazon. Duh! of course! 20 minutes later and there it was! My favorite watch! Well, a new one. I absolutely love it. Thanks to Amazon for having the seller that has it. I actually can buy just about anything here. Thanks again!"
5,Excellent replacement for wheat flour in baked goods such as pizza dough,This flour has a nutty taste that doesn't require salt to conteract the blandness in other wheat and wheatless flours. I havenow gotten in all components needed to begin wheat free baking.
2,Tasted horrible,I bought this almound flour since my other source was currently unavailable. I recieved it and made my usual fruit cake. My cake was just horrid tasting. I tried to force myself to eat it because I dont want to waste food but just couldn't. The product I recieved I noticed tonight was almound meal and not almond flour like in the picture. The two shouldnt taste difference so I doubt that is the reason. I tested to smell also with the leftover flour from my other supplier and the two are completely different. Its like comparing old gasoline smell with fresh gasoline. That how the two were different. I could be just one of the unlucky few to recieve out of date flour but I thought it would be good just for a heads up for future customers.
4,Not bad for toddlers.,"Works great. Good for younger sister who wants to have her own computer. The screen is little, but she has fun anyway."
4,Good used book at a great price,"This books is over $90 in the bookstore! Thank you for getting this to me in a timely manner and for much, much less."
2,Physician Heal Thyself,"Dr. Rude should have read her book before she wrote it. While her advice is sound enough, she almost uniformly fails to follow it herself. Her book doesn't follow the schemata, the grammatical rules, the proofing rules, or the design rules, that she sets out for others. The ultimate example of this was when, in the section on political correctness, she advises the reader to refrain from using perjorative or demeaning terms for ""handicappeds."" ""Handicapped"" is itself considered perjorative and demeaning. She therefore broke the rule in stating it! Amazing."
3,Required Textbook,This was a required text for my tech writing class. Decent book. Not life-changing.
3,Somewhat out of touch with the real world,"A thorough book, but much of the content seems very out of touch with the professional editor's environment and needs. There's a somewhat dated feel to the writing, and when it speaks with about ""how things work"" in the editing world, it's often wrong. However--parts are useful reference, and a beginner might find several parts useful for some basic understanding of editing. Don't buy this book to learn how to be a technical editor, though."
5,A Box a Day,"I really love these cereal bars. They have real milk in them and unlike some of the other ones, they are quite filling. My wife use this for breakfast and for an afternoon snack. Make sure though that you don't leave it in the car when it's cold outside because it has a tendency to really harden up. Store in room temperature and enjoy!"
5,best breakfast!,"I love these cereal bars! I always carry them in my bag. They are healthy and tasty. So far, I haven't found any cereal bars that are better than this one."
4,Taste great and easy breaksfast for on the go.,Great product to have for a grab and go breakfast. Everybody in the family likes it.
5,Honey Nut Cherrios bars taste GREAT!,"one of my co-workers gave me a bar last week and i am like""dude, where did you get this!"" he buys em at a local gas station one at a time. i looked for it at my local stop and shop with no success. then finally i came across a box of six bars at a local cvs store. my wife mentioned amazon.com where for years i had a account with for books and other stuff. i am going to buy in bulk from here. i am hypoglocemic at times and sometimes run out with eating breakfast or lunch so this bar fits the bill! mmmmm good!"
2,Nothing like the real thing.,"I love Honey Nut Cheerios cereal but I can't stand the cereal bar variation. Its just not the same. The milk does not taste like real milk. The excessive sugar makes everything way too sweet. The product is nothing like the one shown in the box art, too. Its much less appealing."
5,Hard to find elsewhere,"These breakfast bars are nearly impossible to find in any traditional grocery stores or any other store around here for that matter. I am always able to find here. Shipping is a little slow, but I'm very happy with them, as always."
4,yummy,I bought this product for a lot of reasons. I have 5 kids and it helps to leave a couple boxes in the car for when they need a snack because stopping to buy fast food or snacks for a family of seven of murder! I also bought it for my dieting. i thoght i could eat one for beakfast and one for lunch but they are not filling.Overall the price is great especially when there is a sale and these cereal bars taste so good.
4,"great pieces, poor sound quality","I think this may be the only semi-available recording of G.'s ""Night in Memphis"" which is a barbaric whirlygig of a composition, and one of her most potent. Unfortunately, the sound quality is very poor, especially during the cantata, when the male singers enter. Plus, throughout the entire CD, there is lots of background sound, including what must be the inmates from the local tuberculosis sanatorium sitting in the front row.All of this detracts somewhat from the music, but not bad enough to justify not buying this album. ""Hour of the Soul"" is another piece which is difficult to locate. It is a winding beast, with mezzo-soprano. The text is from a poem by Tsaetaeva."
4,"AWESOME New take on the ""Archies""","Waiting patiently for this awesome 80's cartoon series to be released onto DVD... I have fond childhood memories of this new take on the Archies, much better than the cartoon series that ran in the 70's .."
5,It is not done better than this,"I am a enthousiastic collector, and have almost all the Time Life rock n roll stuff, as well as Eric Records cds of this era. Although they are essential to any 50s 60s collection, nothing can top ACE series.I could comment like this on all the 50s remasters of this fabulous record label, not only these issues, but especially the Golden Age of American Rock n roll. I can not add anything to the positive reviews than simply summing up my personal view:28 tracks per cd, and sometimes 30! (Time life is also excellent, but you get 15 per cd!)excellent booklets with background info (not surpassed by any label).not the same old songs over again, but many rare and still excellent tracks!last but not least amazing sound quality.So although you might have some songs there on other collections, it is for above mentioned points alone worth it to always have an ACE copy as well."
5,Teenage Crush,Oh my gosh some of these songs brought some very pleasant chills of some rather great times.....that is as far as I want to go....you can take it from there.
4,"Good, but not the best","This thing is huge! 9.5 inches from the base to the tip, 'balls' are about three inches across and has clit stimulation nubbies on top, and is maybe 1.5-2 inches wide. The motor does get hot after a bit. Hair and other things like fuzzies from blankets or sweaters do get stuck to the vibe so make sure to keep it in a ziplock or something."
2,"Sometimes he gets it, sometimes he doesn't","Dean Koontz is a decent writer who falls short more times than not. Sometimes the suspense he delivers is powerful but lately I have been getting tired of his prose. It's as if the author himself is getting burnt out. You have to question an author who dishes out so many books. It takes the value out of the individual novels in my opinion. Midnight had a good premise but became unbearably boring in the middle and I almost didn't finish it. This book has many similarities with other of the author's books. Now if the similarities were interesting and fresh, than it would have been all the better. But they arent. They are boring and tiresome. One thing though that I did like about the book was that it had a positive message which is rare for the horror genre. Koontz has the potential to be a great writer but unfortunatly wears himself too thin. If you want to read fantastic, fresh, horror/fantasy, I recommend Dan Simmons, Robert E. Howard, and Ray Bradbury"
2,barely kept me interested,"This was my first Dean Koontz story I have read. The unbelievablity didn't bother me. I was just bored. It has way too much filler for me, and I am an avid Stephen King reader. The characters were under developed and the ending was disappointing. I finished the book barely out of curiousity but the end was not unexpected. The choppiness of the scenes were off putting. Still I stuck it out and don't regret doing so. It is a shame cause the story could have been deeper if it was written with more passion. It just seemed like it was quickly done cookie cutter style."
5,One of the Classics,Next to Lightning this is my favorite Koontz book. The others reviewers have done a good job with the synopsis so I won't bore you with my version. I'll only say that it is one his best and you won't be dissapointed.
5,Koontz has a fantastic imagination,"I loved this book. The story was intense, scary, and interesting. Koontz points out in this story that we best mind our children and communicate with them, that love is stronger than all, and that if you fool around with mother nature, the consequences can be dire. He definitely isn't boring. I'm passing it around to my girlfriends."
4,COOL,"Cool, if somewhat unbelievable. But, hey! You're supposed to suspend disbelief anyway when reading novels like this!"
2,"Starts with a bang, ends with a fizzle....","After reading the first 10 pages, I was immediately engrossed. Almost like beginning of the movie ""Jeepers Creepers"" (which stunk). I was frightened of what the ""creatures"" were, but once that was discovered, it was a little to difficult for me to beleive in them.This book was a little to sci-fi for my taste."
2,i don't believe in new people,"been a while since i read this. anyway, i seem to remember that there wasn't much of a plot, and that it seem to disappear. koontz seem only to write for his own amusement. i couldn't believe in these new people. for example they were supposed not to feel a certain way, yet one of the guys thoughts gave away that he did feel that way. not very believable. can't remember much about the book otherwise though, except that the plot was horrible. i seem to remember some descriptions making the book worth two stars instead of one"
1,This is not Genetic Engeneering,"This book was recommended to me because of my intrest in genetics. Apparently Koontz learned his genetic engineering from ""D-movies"" (much worse than B-movies) of the '30s and '40s. He didn't learn it from any classroom, text book or journal articles. I was totally revolted by this book and its perversion of science."
4,Compeling characters and a horrifying plot.,"This book is a great book. Not only because of its characters, but because of its setting. It takes placce in a small town in Northern California called Moonlight Cove. Now the fact that it takes place in a small , in the middle of nowhere town is what makes it scary. The characters that Dean Koontz has made up are especially great, because the ages have a huge range. They go from a 12 year old girl to a 50 year old paralyzed man. In this little town citizens are changing. They are changing into their worst nightmare. Why, because of an amber liquid, and because of the Moonhawk Project. I think this book is great, although you have to have a lot of patience, because it is very detailed and long, but it doesn't last."
4,Koontz comes through with another suspenseful thriller,"3.5 StarsKoontz is in top form here. An intriguing fast paced suspenseful plot makes this for a fast read. All characters are fairly easy to connect and identify with. I especially enjoyed Harry's(Wheelchair bonud veteran)character. The only thing that I disliked about this book is the ending. It's a little sappy, and seems rushed. All in all, a good read, and definitely something I would recommend to somebody looking for a good thriller."
5,Great pageturner,This is one of Dean Koontz's better books. Often I didnt want to put the book down. I would recommend this book.
5,SCARY GOOD!!,"If you like scary, horror stories this is the book for you. You will not want to put it down and your knuckles will be white with fear!"
3,Midnight,"I am a Staunch Koontz fan and as I have little time for actual reading, I am left to having to resort to audio books.Deans ""Midnight"" is a variation of one of his frequent subjects, alterations of DNA. When a small town experiences far more then its fair share of strange deaths, an undercover FBI agent, and one of the victims sister come to investigate.This story has many of the elements that I like in deans work. Here is why I have rated it 3 stars. Narrator, I wanted to stop the story because I was so disappointed in his apparent lack of ability to portray the characters. If you are stuck with having to listen to audio books, ie: truck driver. then be warned that it would probably be 4 or 5 stars if you read it yourself, but with J. Charles reading drops it to a generous 3 stars. Thanks for the chance to vent :-)"
2,"Supremely silly, but entertaining","Very silly, pretty much like everything that comes from under Mr. Koontz's pen (he must be moonlighting for the Weekly World News - his story ideas come straight from the tabloids).Yet, Koontz is a talented storyweaver, and despite laughing sometimes in inappropriate places, I was thoroughly involved and entertained by the twisting plot and rich descriptions.My only complaint plot-wise is that he introduced us to the bad guys a bit too quickly, eliminating all suspense from guessing as to who the creatures were. The opening is the best part of the book, by the way, and I knew I wouldn't put it down after an amber-eyed monster killed the jogger. Realizing the nature of the monsters so early in the beginning was a letdown."
1,Confused and Angry,"I don't understand why this seems to be the only Dean Koontz book that is available for the Kindle only in the audio version, but not the written version. But then we are repeatedly warned not to purchase the audio version because the narrator does such a terrible job narrating. Are we being railroaded into buying the audiobook because it is the only option available to us? Is this the only way they can get back the cost they put into making an unlistenable audiobook? I very much want to purchase the written version for my Kindle, but even as Audiblle.com member I will not be forced into buying a bad audiobook simply because it is my only other option to get the book."
4,Compelling and disturbing...hard to put down!,"I have to admit that even though this book scared me to the point of lack of sleep, I could not put it down. It was terribly disturbing because the thought of it ever really happening makes my skin crawl. It was not really my taste, but it was well-written, fast-paced, and extremely entertaining. I can see why Dean Koontz is such a popular author, although I do not see myself reading any of his other books."
2,Disappointing,"As a big fan of Dean Koontz' books, I was rather disappointed with this one. The story dragged, the characters were less than engaging,the theme was even less believable than his norm, and it took some effort to get through it. Dean Koontz is usually a very entertaining author, however, so don't let this book put you off reading his other works, which are typically riveting page-turners."
3,Meh.,"I had to read this for a class - and it started out fine, but by the end it was all so convoluted it was a little difficult to care about the characters or what happened. I sort of wish the villain won."
2,Intriguing but...,Great concept but ended up disppointing in many ways. Not enough depth in the characters and plot. The language was bad almost non-stop and so it was hard to see beyond the foul language to any attachment with the people and to care about the outcome.
3,"This was an ""Unknown"" movie...","""Unknown""...That's exactly how I felt right before I bought the movie. To be honest, it wasn't the suspense/thriller/drama I was anticipating. Although, it did grab my attention. Five guys trapped in a room trying to get out and figure out who's who among themselves...SAW...SAW...SAW wannabe.It lacked the luster, entrigue, and suspense. One of those movies that you'd watch when you have nothing to do."
2,DVD - Unknown,"This was a really weird movie..it was slow getting to its plot.. then almost unbelievable.. then when it got going, you can't leave the room, cause you are stuck from the time you put into watching this mess of a movie.."
5,Great story. Great suspense,"Unbelievable cast! ""Unknown"" is a great, dark film with so many twists, you have to see it more than once to truly appreciate the story. It gets better every time."
5,Unknown....soooo intense.,"Great story line. So many twists and such tension. I was kept guessing who was with which other one . The flash backs were fast and revieled just enough to send you off in another direction. I had several plots figured when it would show another bit of information that would wipe out that plot and take off in another direction....I really enjoyed this type of story telling. I had to scoot my seat closer to the TV to make sure I didn't miss anything. As much as I liked it ,it left you hanging at the end.Just a few minutes more and it would have been perfect."
4,surprise ending,I like surprise endings and this did not disappoint me. Do not expect the expected. All the actors were very good.
2,Defective reel,"This combo was a gift to my grandson. His dad tells me he hooked and was reeling in a 2 1/2 to 3 pound fish when the gears in the reel were damaged. Amazon replaced the product, and I hope it was only a defective sample. Else, only plan to catch small fish."
2,A bit disappointing but not bad,This one is just mediocre but nothing really to get hyped up about and didn't feel like a remake to Romero's 1978 original but it seemed like a rip-off of that horrid 28 Days Later.The zombie/makeup effects were excellent but he main flaws were the opening with Johnny Cash singing the song and then showing weird pictures and the acting was tepid.Theres better zombie movies
2,Ersatz Horror,"OK, its not about a knee-jerk negative reaction to remakes in general. Remakes of classics such as The Thing, The Blob, The Fly, and the super-potent TCM remake, all succeeded with flying colors because they brought fresh ideas and technical expertise to classics that we all love. Not so here. This is no more of a Zombie movie than the horrid 28 Days Later. One thing horror should never be is a crashing bore. What is with all those MTV style quick cuts. You never really see anything, which is just as well, I guess. What you do see looks like hell thanks to the insipid computer effects. A total waste of time, except perhaps for the tiny cameos by Savini and Foree. I had to see it; it was posing as a zombie flick. It isn't one."
1,Galloping Cadavers,"Sue them, George! Sue the butts off every last person involved in the rape of your good name! Then take your money and fund Land Of The Dead. That goes for you too, Tobe."
1,Dawn of the Daft,"Sprinitng zombies, eviscerated victims....? What more could you ask for in a horror movie? How about a director who knows how to make one?! Dawn of the Dead should be shot in the head. The movie started off ok, I had high hopes, but when I saw the pre-teenage mutant ninja zombie tear into her first victim I knew I was in for a bad trip. It was one badly played cliche after another. By the end of it I was snarling. Dawn of the Dead was pure cheese from beginning to end, pure stinky cheese. I've been to family reunions that were more horrific. Unless you are a zombie-phile and you just have to have everything undead then go ahead and waste your money. For the serious movie watcher who likes good entertainment, let this sleeping zombie lie"
1,Missing the Point,"This is the worst re-make ever, without any of the plot, the social commentary, and all the meaningful wit of the original. Also, the re-animated corpses somehow gain superhuman speed and agility making them unbelivable. If you want to see a good remake of a George Romero film check out the 1992 version of ""Night"""
3,A Bit Disappointing,"After all the hype I guess I expected something REALLY good. While the special effects and -- especially -- costumes/makeup were great, I just really had a hard time getting into the movie. It was wise not to provide an ""official"" explanation for the zombification of the human race, but in general the movie amounted to a predictable, generic zombie flick."
3,Another remake that just doesn't quite cut it.,"As remakes go, they generally do not measure up to the original and this movie is no exception. For those of you that have seen the original Dawn of the Dead, be prepared for a dissappointment. With todays technology in computers, I was really expecting to see some real improvements in the special effects. While there were some good moments in this movie, overall, it lacked a punch that the original one gives. They say change is good, but there is just too much change in this movie. The original is scary, fast-paced, and a gruesome good time. This remake is rather silly, often slow-paced, and lacks the visuals that made the original a hit."
3,Disappointing,"This one is not to my taste. I yield to no one in my love for George A. Romero's classic version. When I first saw Romero's as a 15-year-old junior high school kid, coming out of the theater into the street crowds, I honestly feared that the people around me would all turn around and come upon me. But this remake evokes no such fear. Those undeads are so agile and fast-moving that they all seem more alive than the living.Lacking the kind of eerie atmosphere that the original version exudes, the film is much less disturbing and no different from any other monster panic film, say, Jaws, Alien, Blade II, you name it. In other words, this doesn't have to be a zombie film at all."
4,"whoa a good remake, what the hell?","I've seen several awful awful remakes(texaschainsaw,psycho,night of the living dead) and up until this movie I think ""The fly"" is really the only good remake I can think of. I wasn't the only one to groan when I heard they were remaking this classic, however I went opening day with a very biased attitude and I was...Blown away. The opening sequence really hooked me and I was glued in the rest of the movie, good acting,great make-up and good direction.I can't wait for this to come out on dvd."
5,awesome,"I think that movie was awesome and scary. It kept me tense from beginning to the end. If you want to relax, it's not a good movie though."
4,Great Romero Zombie Movie,"Love the Romero zombie movies, some not as good as others, this was one of the better ones. The best ones are Night of the Living Dead (original), and both Dawn of the Deads."
4,Fun to Watch,"This is a great movie to own on HD. The action sequences, SFX, and make up of the zombies demand the highest clarity on your TV. I have enjoyed this movie over and over again. Unfortunately, there arent many special features. There are some interesting deleted scenes, but I feel like they could have done more.Regardless of its minor shortcomings, this is a shining star among the limited HDDVD selection."
4,[...],"If I could retract a previous review I made on Amazon I could. Now that I have seen the movie I enjoyed it. It was pretty good. The pace of the movie was very good. I can't believe at how fast the people turn into zombies once they die. I do agree with people that it's very similar to 28 Days Later, but, I must say this one is 100% better! There are some things I really liked in this movie:1) Story, make-up was just awesome.2) Characters (some you really hoped they'd make it)3) Acting4) Action5) Pace, although it did sort of drag in the mall6) TwistsThings I didn't care for, or would change1) Soundtrack2) Mekhi P? character. I didn't care for his character or story, which was weak. Should've used someone else...I probably could think of many other points, but those were the main ones. Other than those. It was worth the ticket. Entertaining."
4,THE WORLD IS TAKEN OVER BY ZOMBIES!!!,"imagine that, i bet that'll give a scare. i love zombies, just about any horror flick with zombies will make my day. when this first came out, i had high expectations for it, and boy it sure didn't let me down. the first was great for being what it was, mad props. george romero is a wicked man, in a good sense. he does magic with all of his zombie movies. old and new. it's hard to do it like he does, no doubt. but this one, no doubt was up there as well. my kind of thing, the living dead, the blood, the chase, the victims, chaos everywhere! i applaude it as well. and the fact that the zombies were faster was a good idea. i mean it's creepier when they're slow, but when they're fast it's just excitement cause you don't know if they're going to get you or not. the remake was a good one i got to give it to them. the actors did a really good job, ving rhames is the man. great actor, much respect for him. the makeup was great too, overall it was very satisfying."
4,Good thinking Impetus...,"All the more reason to go see Dawn. I do hope it brings in plenty of Money so George can get the funds to finally make ""Dead Reckoning"". I agree that horror movies and monster movies are making a comeback, even though it's only a small comeback. I'm especially looking forward to Van Helsing. It will be the first time we've seen Frankenstein, Dracula, and WolfMan on screen since 1948. So anyway, everyone go see Dawn so George can get the Money to make Dead Reckoning. Peace."
4,GOOD SCRIPT HOPE MOVIE IS TOO,"O.K. here it is in a nut shell, Remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead? I think not. The only things that the 2004 DotD has in common with the 1978 DotD is 1-Dead people are reanimated craving flesh. 2-People hold up inside of a mall. PERIOD! That's it people nothing more, nothing else. If you go into this expecting a ""remake"" of the 1978 version, prepare to be disappointed. However, for the good news, go into the theater expecting nothing more than a great zombie movie and be prepared for a theatrical experience well worth the time and money. If the movie plays out anything like the script reads... MAN OH MAN this will be one great Horror Flick."
1,HD DVD review,"Can't use item because I didn't realize that HD DVD's were different than other DVD's. You need a special DVD player or drive on computer. I wish it would have informed me that a special player was needed for this DVD. So for all persons not realizing this, here is your warning don't buy unless you have the correct DVD player."
1,zero stars,worst movie ever if your going to buy this dont get it . get 28 days later the guy who made this film is an dumb ass dogs can turn into zombies look at resident evil even if this is a remake it sux i was hopeing it would be like the arcade game were its scary and the guy who loved his wife and she was a zombie and she was about to have a kid was the dumbest idea this movie sucked dont get it
5,Dead By Dawn,"I think people should really give this movie a chance. Remakes of classic movies are the greatest idea that Hollywood has come up with. Just look at how long ago these movies were made, no special effects at all becauce there was none back in the days!!! But now they have a chance to take a classic horror movie like ""Dawn of the Dead"" and make it 10 times better then what it originally was to start with, to make it more exciting and scary to watch. I can't wait for this movie to be in theaters it's going to be a great reintroduction to a classic horror movie, please just don't judge the movie before you've actually seen it first, peace out!!!"
1,OH NO!,"It's not enough that I have to hear ""remixes"" of classic rock on the radio. Now I have to put up with remakes of the great classic horror flicks! Let's have remakes of The Day the Earth Stood Still and War of the Worlds while we're at it. How about Casablanca, Gone With The Wind, The Wizard of Oz, etc. How about All Quiet... Oh, that's right, they did that. Never mind. Beam me up Scotty. There's no intelligent life down here.P.S. This hasn't been released. I only put a rating down because I had to. Who knows? Maybe it will be good (and pigs can fly)."
3,when yer stranded on top of a mall whats there to do,"this not a good movie really but this considerabely a better step in the horror genre. This one centers around the characters mainly. But given though not all the charachters are interesting. but at least not all are a waste of our ear. Ving Rhames is the best. There are some good funny bits when Ving Rhames and a buddy on a another building snipe zombies who look like Jay Leno and other celeberties, or when the two play chess from abroad are amusing. there are the usual helpings of twists here and there that certainly can be curve balls and the action and direction is decent enough to make it for a somewhat satisfying package.but one cant help to notice its jsut another zombie pick and the suprise ending seems like the kind of ending thats in horror films lately.and for no good reason."
2,Ving Rhames Vs. Killer Zombies...who will win?,"remake of the 1978 original has some of the same qualities of the original but it's a totally different film. The first 30-40 minutes are good but the stuff in between with the whole fat zombie lady and the zombie baby doesnt help it but it is revived by the last, let's say 10 minutes of the film when the survivers escape at the marina place. Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction, Undisputed), Sarah Polley (GO, My Life Without Me), Mehki Phifer (tv's ER, 8 Mile), Jake Weber (Meet Joe Black, U571) and Matt Frewer (tv's Psi Factor, National Lampoons Senior Trip) are among the cast. I thought this was gonna be like the original but it turned out to be a totally disappointment, though Ving Rhames is always watchable no matter what he is in."
3,Not even close to the original,"See my review under, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, 2pc....................for the younger group, take time, and check out Romeros original,(1978) maybe it will sink in, skip laughing at the clothes or dialogue, just indulge yourself. Now you know why 27 years later people try to redo classics, a quick buck, not even close. Romero is laughing to the bank, he has rights to this gory shootfest remake. He knows who the diehard fans are. Pittsburgh, you rock!!!!!"
4,Great movie. In its own genre.,"I really did enjoy this movie. It scared the hell out of me because I have always had a fear and fascination with zombies, but zombies that can run a triathalon is just scary.The only similarites it has to the original ""Dawn of the dead"" is that a) It deals with zombies b) It is based in a mall and c) it has the same name. It has a couple cameos with original ""dawn"" actors which adds to it a lot.GEORGE ROMERO had nothing to do with this one! So when you watch it, dont judge it because its not up to standards with Romero's movies.This is a great movie to own if youre into the Zombie Genre.I didn't give it all 5 stars because the story sometimes was corny for me but the graphics/effects and the acting was solid."
4,Completely Different From the Original But Still Good,"The only thing the two movies have in common is that they spend some of the movie in a mall. With that being said, I still enjoyed the movie. Very gory, just the way I like my zombie movies. Tom Savini made a guest appearance in this movie as a cop! I was looking to see if he would be on here and he was.Overall the movie is pretty good, especially the end. Stay tuned during the end credits to see more of the movie."
3,"Good effort, but could have been better","First, I am going to forget the fact that this is a remake, and just review it as a stand alone film.I thought the action was good, with some mild sarcastic humor. Some people may not have liked the dark ending, but for a horror movie, I liked it.Unfortunately, there is never any explanation for where the zombies came from, or why. They just appear. Those who never saw the original Dawn of the Dead would have no idea why this was happening. Furthermore, just not scary and chilling enough for a zombie movie.Still, I enjoyed the movie, and I say it was worth watching at least one time if nothing else."
3,Decent,Decent remake to the George Romero Classic lacks the psychological horror of the original but is a step above the films that are coming out now. Well worth the rental and the praise it's getting.
3,Going backwards...bad idea,"Basically, ""28 days later"" redefined the zombie genre...by linking so many modern themes to Romero's classic foundation (ecoterrorists who free the chimps, the SARS/ebola like nature of the virus, the soldiers reverting to savagery, etc.) the zombie movie was pushed beyond the normal format of ""some unexplained phenomena is making dead people hungry."" What made Romero just a bit too implausible was explained perfectly by Danny Boyle. Will I see it? of course...but I hope it's not just CGI and better makeup effects bolted on to the same storyline."
4,*SHE GETS ON HER SOAPBOX*,"I loved this movie. You'll hate this review. But what I really want to say is people unite. Is it just me or has anyone notice the scoring system makes no sense? A BOOK,CD, or MOVIE will have four out of five stars, or nobody wants to give any stars. And while most people agree it sucks or rocks. No one ever likes anyone else reviews written about said BOOK, CD, OR MOVIE. They hate it if it's a good review they hate it if it's a bad review and hate if it's in between. Were is the love? Honestly the math simply doesn't add up. Now I know if this gets posted I'll have 0 out of 99 people finding this helpful. But I'm simply beyond the point of caring because the scoring system just does not compute. At first I thought it was just me but alas it isn't. Love me hate me whatever but I just had to get that off my chest. Holla back if your feelin me."
3,"This is a good, fast moving zombie film. Romero classic? No.","Yes, another Romero fan here. Dawn 78 is slow but very fun, Dawn 04 is fast but kinda dull, thanks to the survivors' constant dialog of former days working at Best Buy, coffee, relationships and whatnot as they sit around ""Hallow Grounds"" coffee hut in the mall (which we don't see enough of due to too many closeups). When they're not talking, the zombie action is pretty good, if you don't mind fast zombies like from ""Nightmare City"".TONS of zombies, plenty of headshots, plenty of gore and a few small feasting scenes, but pales compared to ""Dawn of the Dead 78"".It's definitely worth a look for diehard zombie fans."
3,Dawn of the Dead remake,"I don't know who thought fast zombies were a good idea, but there are not! Other than that this movie is not terrible."
4,Decent update on the old zombie film,"Based in Millwaukee, this film is a non stop thrill ride. Zombies popping out of all places. This movie starts right out from start to finish with non stop thrills, and pretty good special effets. I was not expecting much when I cought this flipping through the movie channels, but I found myself watching it all the way through. Simple to follow, suspenseful enough, worth a rental, or even a purchase."
2,Dawn of the Dead has died,"WOW this was a horrible movie. The original was a million times better. The overall zombie makeup was far too polished and Hollywood looking. Tom Savini should have done the makeup effects for this one. One of the main problems I had with this film was the fact that the zombies run. A zombie is a decaying bag of bones and flesh with nothing more than the most basic of instincts and that is to feed. Thus I thought that zombies wouldn't be able to run, and should throw away their track shoes. George A. Romero was nipped out of a good 4 seconds of his name being in the beginning sequence as compared to everyone else even remotely involved in this film (if you can call it that). The acting was at least halfway descent but still getting a bit on the cheesy side of things. So I give this release a rating of 2."
2,not much better than 28 days,"In fact, it looked more like a remake of 28 days than it did Dawn of the Dead. There is nothing very scary in this movie at all. Van Helsing was a better movie. Rent this movie before you go out to buy it because once youve seen it you wont care to see it again. Better yet, rent or buy 1985's Day of the Dead, probably the best zombie movie to date."
3,"Great movie, but...",I was quite excited to see the movie getting the blu-ray treatment with a nice price tag on it. Great movie. Seen it many-many times. Bought it for the sake of collecting.But...I am disappointed at the fact that there were no added bonus feature to the disc. Really-really disappointed.
1,this movie is crap,"IT,s criminal how bad this movie is ,he world ends in about 10 mins of screen time , there after we are forced to endure 1 hour 30 mins of various idiots trying to get themselves eaten by the zombies.the (....) If you stay for the end of this moronic epic ,your reward is to see the potagonists eaten at the impotent conclusion of the movie.So i have to give this crap 1 star but it gets 5 yawns, my advise avoid it like the plague! and watch the excellantoriginal."
1,"Abysmal with a capital ""A""","I really did want to like this film. I was excited about its release and I couldn't wait to see it! Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed I almost demanded a refund!I didn't feel for the characters and the zombies were amusing if not outright laughable! The audience laughed out loud 5 times during this film. Having people laughing in a horror film is a major indication of something seriously wrong with the film.The film is a satirical rendition of the original at best! It outrageously lacks depth, character development, gripping music/sound effect, convincing dialogue and horrifying zombies among other things. Such a letdown!I cannot in good conscience recommend this film to anyone. It's a waste of time, money and brain cells that have to endure processing such travesty."
5,A BIG STEP ABOVE THE REST!!!!!!!,"take the DREADFUL DARK ATMOSPHERE of LUCIO FULCI'S ""ZOMBI 2"" the COMIC BOOK LIKE COLORFUL VISUAL'S of GEORGE A ROMERO & TOM SAVINI'S original ""DAWN OF THE DEAD"" add a beatiful heart pumping upbeat pace & story,some state of the art makeup & efx & you have got zack snyder's ""DAWN OF THE DEAD 2004"" a MASTERPIECE ZOMBIE FLICK THAT LETS YOU KNOW THAT THE DIRECTOR IS A TRUE ZOMBIE FAN!!!!!!!!!!! im a huge FULCI & ROMERO fan so this is very hard for me to say but ZACK SNYDER'S DAWN 04 is a big step above the rest!the unrated director's cut dvd is wicked pisssssah!some very cool extra's hurry up & get it you won't be discruntled. I swear if you watch Lucio Fulci's ZOMBIE 2 & then watch Zack Snyder's DAWN 04 its like a distant/dated part 1 & 2! anyway E!!!N!!!J!!!O!!!Y!!!"
4,update of previous review,"this is a follow up toM. Sheridan's previous review for the dir's cut dvd. He obvioulsy did not watch it very carefully. thier is 9 mins that were put back into the film, in addition to even more deleted scenes as extras. thanks"
3,Pretty good but...,I would give this movie 4 stars if it wasn't for that stupid as hell zombie baby scene.
5,Great zombie movie.,"I really like this movie, even more so than the original Romero flicks. When the survivors are holed up in the mall it evokes memories of role-playing with my friends as a teenager about what we would do if there were a major world-wide cataclysm. I really like the scene where Andy is shooting celebrity lookalike zombies with his rifle, hilarious!"
4,DAWN OF THE DEAD DELIVERS,"ANOTHER FUN MOVIE WITH ALL THE JUMPS AND GROSS OUTS WE HAVE COME TO LOVE...IF YOUR ARE NOT INTO ZOMBIE MOVIES AND ARE LOOKING FOR ONE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION, I WOULD RECOMMEND DAWN BECAUSE IT DOESNT TAKE ITSELF TOO SERIOUSLY...THERE ARE FUN PARTS!?!BUT THE MOVIE AS A WHOLE PROVES ITSELF TO EVEN THE TOUGHEST OF CRITICS. IS IT WORTH THE BLU-RAY UPGRADE...H*LL YEA!!!"
3,Good If You Like Zombie Movies,"This is definitely a different movie than the original Dawn of the Dead, but that's perfectly okay. It's a movie that you'll probably like if you enjoy zombie/gory films. However, in my opinion, it does slightly suffer from some special effects that are a little too over-the-top/unrealistic and some ""cheesy"" dialogue and (occasionally) acting. Definitely a movie worth seeing at least once."
3,"Almost as gory as the original, but not as edgy","A small group of survivors holes up in a shopping mall in order to survive a plague of zombies, who can only be stopped by destroying their brain.Other than the absence of social commentary, the most obvious difference between this film and George Romero's original is the fact that these zombies are fast runners. This ratchets up the scare factor in the early part of the film by making this version of the undead that much more dangerous and inescapable. However, it soon becomes clear that the characters in this film, many of whom are inexperienced with guns, will be able to make as many head shots as necessary to ensure that the scenes play out as the script demands. There are a number of particularly implausible escapes that feel very Hollywood and break the verisimilitude of the story in a way that the original never did.Still, there is plenty of gore and several good scares, even if it does become a bit tiresome by the end."
5,I HATE ZOMBIE MOVIES.....,"I hate zombie movies, mostly because the thought of the unstoppable living dead who want to feed off your flesh and brains scares the S@!T! out of me.I thought it was nicely down for a remake. The make-up was great, the special effects where good. It had a solid cast including Clint Eastwood's daughters first major role. They've been making Zombie flicks since the 60's, most of them stink, there like porn you can only go in one direction with it. This was not one of them, this was a good movie and it proved it at the box office.I say it is definitely worth seeing and purchasing the uncut version. I did both and I hate zombie flicks, its just one of those films that when its on you have to watch.My one and only complaint it the fact no one ever survives."
3,Good for what it is,"You must keep in mind this is a horror/Zombi movie. It is not ment to be ground breaking or win awards. It is ment to entertain. and that it did. If you like these types of movies than by all means go out and see it. Only one complaint, they give no Explanation as to what caused the dead to walk."
2,Only blood isn't enough....,"When I started watching this movie I was expecting some great biting, flesheating and shocking scenes. The beginning was ok, with the young girl biting a shunk out of her fathers neck. The rest is only shooting some of those zombies in the head. I was waiting for gruelling bites, ripping off flesh, pure gore, but nothing came. They keep shooting them in the head, nothing more and I was getting pretty bored. Even the actors were looking bored instead of afraid. There were never any moments of true fear, no excitement. Good for once, but I think I'll just keep watching the Romero version or Resident Evil again."
4,Wow,"This was pretty sweet as zombie movies go! Not on part with zombieland my favorite, but definitely sweet! I would say great thriller, good base model zombie flick!"
4,Pretty good for a remake,"Zack Snyder's remake of Dawn of the dead proves he is a good director. I was impressed with the effort put into the special effects. I was disappointed by the fact that they did not stick more to George Romero's original plot. There were major differences and more character's seeking refuge in the mall. A select few of the character's were rather annoying and a few of the actors performance's could of been better. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber gave the better performance's in this film. Their plans to go to an island on Steve's boat go awry and the ending is very vague. My thought is the ending was left that way in case they want to do a sequel in the future. Overall it is not the director's fault the script was lacking a bit. This film would of been much better with a few script changes and a few of the character's being eliminanted. But sill it is worth watching."
3,Rook,"The script goes really nowhere. I know, I know, it's a zombie flick. I'm just supposed to like it for the gore. Sorry, I'm not 12 anymore. I enjoyed some of it. The celebrity zombie shoot had me laughing. Most of it, however, lacked. The characters were just stoopid beyond what you'd expect from horror films. They had a good idea about the armored buses, but they can't get a mile from the mall without flipping one, then they drive the other almost off the dock. The Andy rescue was idiotic. If you ask me, the slow lumbering zombies are scarier than the fast moving new zombies. I know many may not agree with that, but look at Michael Myers from the first Halloween. He doesn't run after Jamie Lee Curtis. He walks. Yet it's scary.I gave it 3 stars. It wasn't horrible. It could have been better."
3,not too bad,"to quote a guy outside of the movie theatre: ""i wouldn't say it was a GOOD movie, but it was definitly ENTERTAINMENT"". that's hits it right on the nose. fun as hell to watch, and really funny as well. make sure you watch through the credits for some finalization. also, wait till you hear the jazzy version of disturb's ""down with the sickness"". it's FUNNY."
2,"Disapointed, big time!!!","I'm not going to waste your time telling you about the Movie as we all know its just plain and simple awesome!! But what I will tell you is that this release on Blu ray for the price you are paying you would have thought they could have included the extras from the DVD version. I wouldn't expect them to be in HD format but at least add them on??? There is no ""Andy's Lost Tape"" None of the making or Emergency broadcast extras. They have just slapped it on Blu ray for the sake of the movie. Not good for a collector at all make sure to keep your DVD release."
5,get ready to swipe your card! YOU WANT THIS MOVIE!,"until this movie i had never seen a zombie movie worth seeing. From the originals, to 28 days later and resident evil, i had never been impressed. this movie eliminates (and vastly improves upon) the corny and outdated slow moving, weak, drooling zombie and replaces it with a much more intense (and graphic) depiction of a post-human flesh-craving monster. Haven't seen this movie? Buy it! Kill the lights, crank the surround sound, and have the one you love close by...he/she will make your arm numb they'll be holding it so tight. this movie does not disapoint. get it...NOW.-a"
4,Great Slasher Flick!,"Hearing my 13 yr. old son tell me; ""I don't want to watch that"" for a half hour till we did sit and watch it was priceless. I personally jumped a couple of times but laughed a whole lot more. I hadn't seen this at the theatre so, I very much enjoyed this movie. having grown up when slasher films were making big bucks, I couldn't resist. the movie itself was well done. it surprised me, it being a ""zombie flick"" after all. I would definitly suggest this movie to all movie goers. after everything was said and done, I laughed myself to sleep watching my son twitch and moan out ""No, they're gonna get me!..."" then earlier today we watched again, at his request..."
2,Two and a half at best,"The movie was fun and had lots of gore but little else. The characters were OK and the acting OK but this was not a great horror flick. There were no surprises and little plot. Entertaining but little else.Hey, sometimes you only want two and a half stars..."
1,0 STARS: This is ridiculous.,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is about some people that set up in a mall and shoot some zombies in order to stay alive. The acting is pretty terrible and the plot is stupid. If you like watching people shoot flesh-eating zombies with a lot of blood and gore, this is for you. But, other than that, there is simply nothing to this movie...this is just not enough to keep my interest. So, if you're looking for a real horror movie or dare I say ""scary movie"", don't even think about watching this garbage."
1,helpfull info,So yet again the american movie indistry has to ruin an otherwise great movie with a sequil but thats to be expected. A word of advise dont buy this movie commit suicide and get your friends to film it. Its a lot more entertaining and a hell of a lot cheaper.
1,WAAAAYYYYY tooo scary. Do not buy.,This movie is way too scary for anyone. I watched it for 5 min. and immediatly took the disc out. Nobody needs to watch this gory movie.
1,Another Piece Of Crap Re-Make,First of all if you think this is better than the original or are unaware that there is even an original then do everyone a favor and stop watching movies...This movie was crap. They totally changed it from the original...for instence the movie starts off as there being no zombies where as in the original this carnage has been happening. Being a re-make and a sequal at that should reflect the orginals and not go for cheap scares. AND SINCE WHEN CAN PEOPLE WHO DIE AND COME BACK TO LIFE RUN! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT! This movie sucks. DONT BUY IT.
2,"Would have been better if named ""28 days ago""","After viewing this film, I thought I was watching 28 days later again. This was a fun film, but to the throw the dawn of the dead name on it was just totally not the best idea. Once again we had super fast quick shots, and it didnt show anything. You dont even see a zombie eat somebody. I guess hollywood couldnt afford the 2 second shot of that, and needed something fast.The movie lacked the great things that made the original so great. The indepth story, the character buildup, Goblins doing the soundtrack etc...Again, i think it was a good movie, but my best suggestion is dont go into the theater thinking that this is anywhere even related to the original. I mean they stay in the mall for what 7 days which equals what, a half hour of screen time?"
1,dissatisfied customer,the ad for this dvd did not state that a HD dvd player was required to view it and I have been getting a major run around with Amazon.com trying to obtain a satisfactory resolution. I am a long-time and good customer and deserve a prompt and satisfactory resolution.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Another pointless horror remake, Dawn of the Dead delivers some scares but comes up short in terms of characterization and plotting and can't hold a candle to the superior 1978 original."
4,thump.....thump.....thump,i do have to say that i dont get scared vary easy but this film did scare me a bit i thought it was cool when the baby monster was born.but what i find fake is that how could a dead person come back and walk around.well anaway if you have seen 28 days later and liked it than you will probaly like this film. but that is not always true because i thought that 28 days later was stupid.
3,Falls a little short,"From the opening scene in a hospital till the last scene of the movie the B-movie effect was a little too strong. I'm not saying this movie is terrible - not saying that at all. But I think the movie relied too much on special effects and gore.One of the best ways to pull people into a movie is to make the characters likable. I found myself not caring, even the slightest, whether any of the main character were ripped to shreds by the zombies.The movie ""28 Days Later"" managed to do a much better job with this concept. The characters and dialogue were much more interesting. I would recommend ""28 Days Later"" to anyone thinking of buying this film.See ya next review."
5,best zombie movie ever!,"The 2004 re-release of Dawn of the dead not only topped the original by about 1000x , but is also the best horror movie ever! (If not the best movie ever)"
5,BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!,"I am 13, and I know that this is the best zombie movie ever made! I definetly give it 5 stars! It is so realistic! You have to buy it! I have seen all of the zombie movies and this is definetly #1!!! It is a lot better than the original one."
1,STOP IT ! YOU'RE IGNORANT!!!!!,"Okay -- here's a successor to Waterworldcourtesy of Universal.What's offered is a remake that didn'tdeliver adequate homage to Mr. Romero'soriginal -- this deserves Servo and Crowcommentary.And throughout this debacle, characterspepper the word ' f**k ' into every sentencethey manage to deliver.Perhaps I'm biased, as I visited the siteof the Original release and stared in aweat the skidmarks of the film's bikers.They don't use bikers in this thing, though;instead a truck armed with a plow to makethe zombies into dog food."
1,Poor remake of a classic,"This remake is poor, compared to the original 1978 classic. The zombies are fast, the gore is low. Just bad all the way around. If there's another remake, I hope someone gets it right."
3,Fair transfer to BD,"This movie rocks and BD sound kicks up a notch an already gore drenched flick. I found the BD transfer grainey and was a little dissapointed with the quality, great movie though ,a must have for any horror movie collector."
3,"Ok movie, NO EXTRAS?!?!","This movie certainly wasn't the train wreck I was expecting, seeing how it was a remake of a classic. I've seen both the director's cut and the theatrical cut, and I couldn't tell you the difference between them.The reason for the 3 stars has to do with the lack of extras. There are NO extras on this Blu-ray! None!"
4,Pretty Entertaining if you like Zombie films,"Dawn of the dead stars a nurse whose boyfriend comes down with a strange disease which turns him into a flesh-eating zombie. Things get worse as she realizes the entire city is infected. Teaming up with a gang of misfits and a terse police officer, the group hide in a mall, until tempers flare.Ultimately, the group decides to try to make a 'run for it' for a nearby boatyard. Can the group make it in time?I enjoyed the team dynamics of this film. I thought there was some great acting and the special effects were overall were great. The plot is basically 'us against them' with an added dash of a timelock. My only disappointment? I really wanted to know what happened in the end!Great, fast moving, gory fun."
5,Awesome! Could not have been any better!,"A long review is not necessary-basically, it ruled!. You should see this completely blind. It was by far the best horror film i have ever seen. I can say this despite cheezy-dialogue at parts. the effects were virtually seamless and fierce IN YOUR FACE BRUTAL FIGHT SCENES! The topper was the opening and closing credits-dont leave untill you see the closing credits in full. You can tell Zach Snyder really worked on this movie, and he is a virtually unknown director-awesome first movie and it hopefully wont be his last. Sarah Polley was as awesome in this as she was in ""Go"". I cant say enough good things."
5,A Must See!,"This film was awesome! It had the humor, gore, and suspense of the original. A lot of familiar faces too. I enjoyed every minute of the movie. It is pretty intense. I laughed, jumped, and found myself just horribly entertained. It is a great film. The only relation to the first is that they're in a mall. The film plays more like a sequel than a remake. That's why I think it is so good, because it is it's own movie. A must see for ANY, and I mean ANY, true horror film fan. Take it from a guy who's seen almost as many horror movies as Rob Zombie, at least I think."
3,One Word Romero,"Just ask yourself this one question living dead/ Zombie fans. Why isn't George Romero directing this movie? Money/ creative control etc??? I will see this movie when it comes out, because as one reviewer stated lighten up people when was the last good zombie movie? ( House of the dead)NOT! 28 days later is about a virus that causes rage, great movie not a zombie movie tho. As far as the Anchor Bay re release dvd of the classic Dawn when last i checked the website they were not even including Document of the dead as an extra oh why do we never get the good stuff like Europe does maybe because we buy the same dvd over and over again like the many different versions of Halloween. Zombie fans go see this remake if only to compare and remeber the good old days."
1,Extras??????,"My Review is on the Dawn of the Dead (Unrated Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] (2004), great movie, looks good in HD. But where is the extra content??????? would have gave it 5 stars if it had some."
5,Destroys the 78 version,"This movie was great in every way, wish they would make a sequel. Unfortunately they used the name of a campy lame 1978 zombie film that also took place in a mall. But because the original holds a special place in the hearts of many, this film will get mostly venom along the lines of ""Romero is great blah blah social message blah blah MTv blah blah."" Lets be honest the 78 version was good in 78, not now. Blue zombies, orange blood lumbering around (if you get caught you deserve it) the pie fight scene and the lame dialogue of the 78 version just doesn't age well. And lets not forget the ""dead rise and eat the living"" is believable, but the ""recently infected can run"" is somehow unbelievable. Start to finish this movie was great and is awesome to watch as a double feature with Shaun Of The Dead. Stay away from the Land of the Dead, its more of the ""social message"" garbage. Luckily Romero can't claim ownership over zombies even though his worshippers wish he could."
3,It's alright,"This movie started out great because it really scare my at first,but very slowly the movie gets boring like 28 days later only on survival and not enough scary scenes."
3,whatever happened to slow zombies...?,"i just got back from seeing the movie like half hour ago and i thought it was alright. it was funny and made you jump sometimes, too. but, i thought the zombies sucked in comparison to the original cut; they were too damn fast. i mean, like some other reviewer said, they were too much like the 28 Days Later zombies. they were supposed to be dead and draggy and slow. but i guess it was alright."
4,The First Best Movie That is a Remake!,Just as good as the orginal Dawn of the Dead. The first Dawn of the Dead was awesome and this one measures up to its standards! The movie is awesome! When i went to see it in March I felt as if it may dissapointing..but no...i was soo happy...i loved it!How can you put down a cult movie! It had the same moments and atmosphere as the orginal! This is the first movie i have ever seen to be good as a remake!!!
2,"So-so zombie movie, lacks interesting characters","The movie is fast paced and gory, but none of the characters stands out. People hole up in a mall, fight over who's in control, deal with a few zombies that get in, and then hop in a couple of trucks and run for it. This movie is a tad better than the awful Resident Evil movies. The pretty nurse that the story pretends to be interested in at the start never develops into much of a protagonist. Ving Rhames seems to be playing a part written for Chuck Norris. The rest of the cast plays various sleazy, plain, or panicky types. I think maybe Walking Dead has raised the bar for these kinds of stories."
3,Zombies?,Plenty of zombies. Plenty of gore. Loosely acted and some really stupid humor. The Walking dead it is NOT. B-movie blockbuster? Sure..
3,It's an okay movie,"This doesn't even compare to the older version. It had very good special effects and makeup, but I just couldn't get used to the idea of running zombies. It kinda takes away from the zombie genre. They're called the ""walking dead"", not ""running dead"".I felt the old version had a better story and chills. This one probably didn't have as much good action as the old version either. But it does have it's moments. It is still worth seeing if you like zombie movies though."
5,This is a great effort for a modern day horror film,"I don't know why so many didn't really like this movie. You have everything you could want in a horror movie. The dead have arrived and are quickly exterminating anyone who's not dead. A team of people hole up inside a large shopping mall, trying to decide what to do next. There is lots of infighting by the strangers who now find themselves surrounded by a city of dead walkers who aren't going to rot and die before taking them with them. Spooky action scenes in the underground parking garage tell the team that the dead they face are not as dumb as they look. Ving Rhames...can't say enough about this guy, he is a great actor and I am glad he was in this movie. He is able to bring out the best and worst in the team of people and keeps a balance among them. The interactions with the man on the roof of the opposing building are also a good addition to this movie. Go see it now!!"
3,Dawn of the Dead,"""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will ((RUN ))around the earth??"" Sorry, this did not work for me. ""Dawn of the Dead"" was the same situation as ""Night of the living Dead""But showed you what a different set of people did in that time of crisis.What I am looking for in a remake,,,,,,,or rather sequal is exactly that. Zombies, that are Zombies, I'm sure there were more survivor's how and what did they do to stay alive?So if they plan on making another remake,,,,,,,,,FOR GOD'S SAKE THEY DO NOT RUN!! Please remember ""They are dead, (...)"""
3,Dead Remake,"The original is a classic. This remake is well done with the survivors trying to hold down the shopping mall again. This time it is a much larger group. Maybe to large since you really don't get to know any of them all that well. Pretty much Polley and Rhames carry the movie. Attention S-Mart shoppers! Yeah no S-Mart here but it should have had Bruce Campbell and his wise cracking. Just the same the cast is good and do a nice job of pulling you into the movie. Not very much levity but a good entry into the fighting the undead horror genre. It will have you talking to your friends about what you would do in this situation. ""Shop Till You Drop"" some would say. Or how about some celebrity zombie target practice like they do in the movie. Fans of the original should enjoy this one as well. Good directing and pacing of the story. The sets and music are well done and add to the overall feel of being trapped."
3,Dawn of the Dead 2004,"I had to give this movie 3 stars for the story line, which was predictable from the beginning. This was a very graphic and gory movie. It did have good special effects though. If you can sit and watch a movie that serves no purpose, but to show it's graphic and special effects, then this would be an okay purchase. I would recommend renting this before buying though. If you are a viewer that NEEDS a strong story line and purpose to give the movie and the effects meaning....rent it."
5,Let's keep it real.,"OK. Let's start off by saying this is not a re-make of Romero's ""Dawn"", this is its' own film. Yes, some this movie takes place in a mall but that's where the similarties end. This movie had a faster pace than the original and just a different plot all together. I loved the fact that the director gave homage to the original by placing some great cameos in the movie (i don't think alot of people caught the BP truck markings). This is just a great film unto itself. I really loved it and cannot wait for the DVD release and maybe finnaly 'ol George can make the 4th installment in his dead series, ""Dead Reconing"". P.S. Be sure you stay all the way through the credits. PPS.(...) That movie was a total farce. It was not a ""zombie"" flick nor was it worth watching."
3,"Not bad, certainly not good, either.","I was very much looking forward to this film. However, I find that it's rather disappointing in many ways. The main thing that bothered me is that the sense of horror so evident in the original is missing. The single-minded, plodding, implacable zombies of Romero's movie are replaced here by undead who perform as world-class athletes. The new zombies move so quickly, and are so difficult to view, that they might as well be nothing more than crazed sprinters. You never get the sense of dread and incoming doom that the monsters from the earlier film presented. Because of this, the new DAWN is not much more than an action thriller. As a horror movie, it just plain missed the mark."

1,ANOTHER GOD AWFUL RE-MAKE FOR THE CHEAP SCARE HORROR FANS!,"WHEN ARE THESE BRAIN DEAD HORROR FANS GOING TO STOP SEEING THESE LOUSY STINKING RE-MAKES? THE ACTING IS LOUSY, YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PAPER THIN CHARACTERS, I DO NOT LIKE ROOTING FOR THE ZOMBIES, BUT I HATE THE COLORLESS CHARACTERS IN THIS MOVIE! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SOCIAL COMMENTARY MESSAGE THAT WAS IN THE CLASSIC 1979 ONE? WAIT A MINUTE, THE 79 ONE SHOW WHAT BRAIN DEAD CONSUMERS PEOPLE HAVE BECOME, WELL THE RE-MAKE WAS MADE ESPECIALLY JUST FOR THEM! WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND EFFORT! NOTHING BUT CHEAP SCARES! WHY DOESN'T BIG HOLLYWOOD MAKE SMART AND REAL SCARY MOVIES LIKE LIONS GATE STUDIOS! SAW, OPEN WATER, FRAILTY, DAGON NOW THESE ARE ORIGINAL, SMART AND SCARY MOVIES THAT MAKE YOU THINK! WAIT I SAID A DIRTY WORD TO YOU CHEAP SCARE FANS! SORRY! TOTAL PIECE OF CRAP!"
1,Dawn Of the Dead-I hate Remakes.,"I didn't care much for the original and I certainly don't care for the remake, With more Gore to try to out-do the other.If your a fan perhaps you would appreciate, but I don't count Gore as Classic Horror."
1,why praise a copy of a ground breaking movie,"one star cause i can't rate it!!! and every extra star after i've seen it has to be earned the hard way!!!!!!!!!!this movie even if it's the best the world has ever seen, will never get more than 4 stars cause its concept was stolen!!!not borrowed.it will be interesting to see if the new movie can incorporate the satirical elements like the original could, i doubt it but hey we will see. its unlikely we will see a good attempt like doyle's 28 days later (i loved it til they met the soldiers).we should at least get the average run of the mill hollywood style, simple, unimportant, easy to digest entertainment worth 2 stars. so lets wait and see, but keep in mind a new idea is a new idea only once!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A cruel slap in the face to horror fans,"I usually like horroo films,and I thought this would be as interesting as ""Cujo"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street."" I was sadly mistaken.The actors are TERRIBLE,the plot stinks and the whole movie is a waste of time.I felt like I was watching some bland movie made by some terribly bored person who was hungry for money.My advice is: Do not waste your money on this turkey,and get ""Cujo"" instead."
1,Romero fanboys only,"I'm not generally a fan of the horror genre, aside from ""The Exorcist,"" and various elements of other movies that ultimately failed on one level or another--just bear this in mind in reading my review. ""28 Days Later,"" though flawed, was a refreshing change of pace to what I considered the stagnant zombie movie subgenre (yeh, not a Romero devotee); and it was with that in mind that I rented this retread. This film borrows the ""fast zombie"" concept from the aforementioned one, but utilizes none of the stark images or philosophical commentary. Aside from zombies in the mall--blah. There was nothing surprising here, when thinking of other movies I've seen.Comparisons aside, and more importantly, if you agree that a movie is about characters and dialogue--or even just original and imaginative situations--this film does not deliver. A motley crew of zombie fighters--or a collection of banal stereotypes--die by attrition in predictable and irritating ways."
1,No Way,This is probably one of the worst zombie movies I've ever seen. The plot makes absolutely no sense at all. One day the dead just walk yeah thats great. George Romero should be furious with this mockery. The only thing that saves the movie from a total bust is Ving Rhames
1,Zack Snyder ??????,"This pretty boy should go back to directing childrens movies,leave the zombie movies up to MASTER GEORGE A. ROMERO.dawn 2004 sucks a fat one"
4,Honest evaluation of Britain's involvement in Uganda,"I did not appreciate Ms. Walker's comments but I did enjoy reading the response to her review. I truly believe, as well, that Ms. Walker is not aware of the political events concerning this book and needs to take another look at her views and probably check out her spelling and grammar as well.Mr. Hill is spot on in this book. He does not put Britain in a good light at this point in recent history. There has been some true research done here. Many countries have disgusting acts for which they should be held accountable. Britain is not alone.I felt such a loss when one of my favourite authors left us earlier this year. His knowledge and ability to put in on paper will be truly missed."
5,Crank it up!,"This is the second album I ever got. The first was Pyromania. This album was heavier than Pyromania (it seems as if they started to slow with every album until the got back to the older stuff on Retroactive), but softer than their first album, On Through The Night, but it was definitley better written and played here. Lotsa pounding songs to get your adrenaline up, especially No No No. After listening to albums after this one, it makes me think that guitarist Willis (who was kicked out of the band after this album because of his alcohol and drug abuse) may have been the one behind that. But the success of this album got them on their way and they haven't looked back since."
5,Signature,"This is a signature album full of signature Def Leppard rock 'n' roll. Bringin' On The Heartache is signature Def Leppard all in one song. Very classic, very popular. Even better follow up: Switch 625. Great instrumental, very guitar driven. It's just great, very up beat and fast rock 'n' roll. Just plain good rock 'n' roll."
5,Outstanding! This is Def Leppard at their Best!,"High 'N' Dry is Def Leppard at their peak. Before they became the over-produced glossy 80s pop band, these guys rocked with the best of them. Flip the switch and listen to Steamin Steve Clark smoke up the joint!!!!"
5,The First Classic Album,This is tied for my favorite Def Leppard album along with Hysteria. Mutt Lange infused ideas from his days producing AC/DC with the more pop oriented and raw talent of early Def Leppard. The result is an album that is raw and melodic. Not quite heavy metal but it has enough big riffs for any metalhead to enjoy. Def Leppard would never be this aggressive again but that's just what makes this album special.
4,"a ""near masterpiece"" from Def Leppard that ROCKS","Def Leppard's High N Dry gets 4 stars from me because in comparison to Pyromania, it just falls a hair shy of brilliance. If Def Leppard never recorded Pyromania and went straight to Hysteria, then High N Dry would be their best album by far. This one rocks harder than any that followed it, yet still has the guitar hooks and stellar vocals that propelled Def Lep to Hall of Fame-worthy status. I highly recommend this one as the 2nd DL in your collection after you own Pyromania. My favorite tracks include: Bringin On The Heartbreak, You Got Me Runnin, Lady Strange, On Through the Night."
5,GREAT CD!!!...,"This is one of their best cd's. Hooking up with Mutt Lange was a great thing for DL. On Through The Night was a great cd also, but they don't sound as experienced as they do on High n' Dry. This is definitely the start of DL. With each album came some changes, but they found a way to get better and better. Even the newer cd's still have a certain amount of the DL sound without Steamin' Steve Clark. They will never loose that edge they had on this cd, it still shows through. I would definitely recommend this cd to anyone who wants to find out what DL is all about. I can't wait to review the next one...Soon!!"
5,Classic 80s Britsh metal,This album is one of Def Leppards best. Classic 80s British metal. Great hardcore guitar work and fast too. You can not get this on iTunes. Buy this album and enjoy.'
3,Raw but geneally solid,"Of couse, this is from before their ""Pyromania"" glory but there are some solid songs on this disc. The sound is understandably raw but the nostalga value makes up for that (if you're over 30 that is...). If you can, find a version that has the song ""Me and My Wine."" Great song.Recommended."
3,Classic 80's,"If I had to name only 10 great 80's bands, Def Leppard would be in the top 5. Their second album has some memorable songs. This is a great cd if you like older Def Lep (as I do). Another hard-to-find title."
3,AC/DC Influenced Hard Rock,"I rated this album three stars because there is some filler on here, but there's a lot of good stuff, too. I enjoy most of it, but like I said, some of it can be quite filler. It is all very AC/DC influenced, sometimes to an extreme. But it all works out evenly. Some of the best songs on here are Another Hit And Run, Bringin' On The Heartbreak, and Mirror, Mirror. Overall, this is a pretty good album by AC/DC worshiping kids."
3,A very good album not their best.,"This album is a must have for hard core Leppard fans but not if you are an 80's rock lover in general. ""High And Dry"" is awesome one of my favorites and ""Bringing on The Heartbreak"" is excellent as well. Some of these songs don't have enough enough polish, a bit too much wailing and noise. In subsequent albumns they learned to produce songs with melody and crunch which explains why Pyromania and Hysteria sold millions and millions. I know I wouldn't have been such a huge fan if those albumns weren't produced. Some people think it's cool to like a band only for the albums that didn't sell as well. The reason ""High'N' Dry"" wasn't huge is because it isn't as good as the next two albums. Plenty of rock fans like myself like to be able to sing along to our favorit rock-n-roll tunes....."
3,3.5 stars...too AC/DC-ish sounding for me but good nonetheless,"I know, go ahead and click that negative review write away just from reading the title of my review. Oh hell, what does this guy know. But it's true, this record sounds alot like an AC/DC record, and go figure it would after you hire Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange to produce you, after he just got done producing AC/DC's 3 best albums ever (Highway to HelL, Back in Black, and FTATR...WSY). There is some signature Def Leppard songs here, Bringin on a Heartbreak and Mirror Mirror are Def Leppard in their own style, but songs like High N Dry and Let It Go, reak with Angus Young sounding solos. They are good songs, but they have an AC/DC edge not the Def Leppard byte! All in all a great album, from a great band, and there next album Pyromania will kick your ass."
5,Simply the Best,"Put simply, this is the best album Def Lep ever released. Although not nearly as commercially successful as ""Pyromania"", this album is more raw and more true to what they sound like live rather than the studio polished sounds of ""Pyromania"". Don't get me wrong, I love ""Pyromania"" and all their other stuff, but every album since ""High N' Dry"" has been filled with more synths and studio tricks that they can not produce live. This is still one of my all time top 10 favorite albums. If you like 80's melodic metal, this is a MUST have (especially if you think some of their stuff is closer to Pop). Every song has a great guitar riff along with a catchy, melodic chorus you'll find yourself singing along with long after the song is over."
4,Pyromania schmyromania--this one's better,"People think I'm absolutely nuts when I express the opinion that ""High 'N' Dry"" is a much better album than ""Pyromania"". Don't get me wrong--I like ""Pyromania"". I LOVE ""High 'N' Dry"". Leppard just totally rocks out on this one, and there's some sorely underrated gems on here, notably ""Another Hit 'N' Run"" and ""Lady Strange."" Still play the hell out of it at home, and together with ""Hysteria"" are my two Leppard must-haves. ""Saturday/I feel right/I've been drinking all day""--how can you not love that!"
5,They have a cult following at Miss Porters,"Here at school my friend Amenity started to go out w/ her father's best friend's son, Rowan. Who happens to have three very handsome older brothers, two are in the Push Kings. So now we have a video of three of their music videos they made for harvard which we watch all the time. These guys are amazing. now they are Gap Models/ Musicians in California. Not a bad way to live."
2,Nauseatingly Sweet. It's slick and sticky.,"Sort of like DC TALK without the religion. They seem to be trying so hard to be the next big boy band but 'N SYNC they aren't. Of course, their indie roots have been plucked, and they probably don't have much cred left (unless playing the viper room is credible). Fame and fortune are what these harvard educated rich kids are after. If you don't mind music without any integrity and you aren't impartial to the sweetest, stickiest bubblegum pop, then you might not mind the PUSH KINGS. But in desperately cultivating a retro image (complete with floppy hairdo's and tight clothing), they are miscalculating their appeal while their music alienates their indie fan base (if it hasn't already). If they are big in Japan, so am I."
5,great music for any occasion,"the push kings are a fabulous boston/ sam fransisco band that really deserve the ear of anyone with an interest in a carefully written song. they have become extremely popular among dj's at williams college and performed here in the fall. they are a great live act and charmingly had their little brother selling their 7 inches in the back. this album contains some of their best work like ""we dont have to say goodbye forever"" which they explained to me after the show got them over huge in japan, diamonds are forever and little star. if u arent familiar with the push kings, givem a listen u wont be dissapointed!"
2,No substance here,"This 'instructional' DVD is pretty much just fluff, and I am not talking about the ample pubic hair. You could sum it up in two minutes: If you want to have an orgasm, both of you concentrate on it really hard, and rub her in the right place. 'now where would that be? Duh.' The sex scenes are clinical, the 'science' is daft, and this 'institute' -- while undoubtably a good place to work - is a front for posers and rip off artists. I gave it two stars because it does no worse than most of the 'sex instruction' dreck out there. And some of the couples they interviewed seemed attractive and sincere. Wanna be a better lover? Get a good lover. And teach yourselves. But don't waste your money on this."
2,basic things,"The video is okay if you know little about sex and woman body. It shows you basic structure of a woman private area, where is the most sensitive area and some basic technique to turn on your partner. If you have more than 5 yrs sex experience, you should know those things already."
1,Mop Refill,This is not like the original sponge that you purchase when you buy the entire mop. It is a piece of foam rubber that does not absorb the water well and does not conform to the floor. You might as well wash the floor with a piece of cardboard. It is awful
2,No good,"In my experience, most of the screw-on parts did not fit securely, or at all. Which made it very difficult to use."
1,Terrible New Blue Sponges by Quickie,"I wanted to order the YELLOW sponges because they are no longer available from retail stores. YELLLOW sponges are the real old fashioned sponges that absorb everything. When my order arrived it was a box full of the BLUE sponges that are the new, cheap, non-absorbant sponges that really wet your floor when mopping rather than absorb the spilled liquid. These are terrible. Don't buy them. When you dunk the mop into a bucket of water to rinse the sponge out, the sponge never really squeezes out the excess water. Rather, you commence mopping the floor and find that you are soaking the floor with the bucket water which leaves lots of water streaks on the floor. This is absolutely terrible. Buy the YELLOW sponges (if you can find them) or don't use the QUICKIE mop at all. These ""new and improved"" sponges are cheap and they DO NOT WORK. Amazon has the yellow sponges advertised, but they send the blue ones. I am so upset."
2,not as pictured,I bought this because in the picture it is yellow. Ozbo sent a blue sponge. So don't buy this one if you want a yellow one.
1,waste of money,"I bought a Quickie mop recently to use in my apartment. Nothing challenging - small apartment, hardwood floors. It was a few dollars more than I'd expected, but hey, it came with an extra sponge head. After three or four not-very-strenuous uses the sponge separated from its plastic backing. The replacement sponge didn't even last that long.What a rip-off - avoid these like the plague unless you like throwing your money away."
1,Quickie Original Standard Sponge Mop Refill,"Quickie Mfg. Corp. and Amazon should be shamed for selling this product. As a previous reviewer has said, the refill does not fit the Quickie Original Standard Sponge Mop. $6.49 thrown in the trash! While we did not get the chance to actually use the sponge refill, since it won't stay on the mop, the refill clearly is not the quality of sponge that comes originally on the mop. By the way, this refill is not made in China, either, but in the good old USA."
1,"Joyva, you gave me no joy...","They were stale. They are not returnable. For a halvah lover, this was a blow indeed...."
2,halvah,"came in good time. but the bars were stale. Very disappointing, considering how expencive they are!!!"
5,"A great album, but a sad farewell","This is the first album the band did without the musical genius of Steve Clark. That made me sad when I first picked it up, but that sadness soon disappeared and was replaced by this wonderful tribute to Steve's memory. The opening song ""Let's Get Rocked"" is not only great, but very funny as well. I also love the ballad ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad"" and the sexy ""Make Love Like a Man."" It was on this tour that I saw Def Leppard for the first time (with the very excellent Vivian Campbell), and I had the opportunity to hear all of these songs live. I can tell you, the live Leppard is great, but if you can't see them live, then at least do yourself a favor and pick up this album! It's worth the price!"
4,Another good one.,"I read the title of the album and thought maybe they retooled and were ready to kick it back into high gear. What I got was another pop driven album with some good rockers mixed in. I would give this album 4 1/2 stars as I thought it was better than Hysteria. Tonight is probaly one of my favorite tunes these guys ever did and Lets Get Rocked is another good positive rock album for all to have a little fun to. But this album also was marked with tragedy as Steve ""Steamin"" Clark died while making this album. That was why it took almost 5 years to get this album done. Clark plays and writes some of the tunes on the album, but this band can't seem to catch a break."
3,anderalize is ok,it was 1992 when anderlize came out .def leppard is the best band in the world. anderalize is not their best cd. . but the cd is not bad. lets get rocked tonght white lighting tear it down are the best songs on anderalize .
3,Hysteria II,"Rick Savage said in a interview that a lot of these songs were ""Hysteria"" leftovers. Couldn't have said it better myself, Sav! Sonically, it's perfect, but the same ground was covered much better in ""Hysteria"". It's still a fun album to listen to, though. Let's get rocked!"
3,Good 90's Release. Follows a similiar pattern to Hysteria.,"This could of been a Hysteria part 2 but failed. This isn't a bad record but probably there least listenable since On Through The Night. Overall Still Leppard style tunes as ""Let's Get Rocked"",and typical ballad ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad"". Still worth getting. Great tour by the way for this release. 3 1/2 stars at best."
3,Hysteria's little brother,"This album sounds similar to Hysteria which is it's strength AND weakness. Two years of Hysteria touring and promotion caused this follow-up to sound a little bit tired. Maybe the guys needed a longer break after the Hysteria tour (or perhaps they spent too much time in the studio). The absence of the late Steve Clark had a negative impact on this project as well. Phil Collen attempts to play guitar parts sounding like Steve, but only to mild success. Still this is a very respectable album. ""White Lightning"" is reason enough to get it. A great epic song that's reminds me of ""Gods of War"" from Hysteria."
4,Does not measure to Pyromania or Hysteria.,"Ok for the price, but not Leppards best work. Steve clark had just died and they had yet to replace him with Vivian campbell.I'd recommend Euphoria from 1999 over this one."
2,a letdown again,"this remaster is completely unnecessary, sounding no different than the original. however, it does collect a few good b-sides together (the Tonight demo being most interesting).However, not even all of the adrenalize-era b-sides appear here, so it fails to even fulfill that simple role correctly!this record was a disappointment in 1991 and is a disappointment again today. :(my advice would be to skip this remaster, and wait for the inevitable b-sides collection that will come out someday (perhaps on the band's 40th anniversary...?)"
2,Nope,"Adrenalize is Def Leppard's worst album in their catalogue for sure. There isnt anything more i can add that hasnt been said already i dont think there is any doubt that White Lightning is the best song on the album. The other decent song is called Tonight it looks to me like Def Leppard tried to make an album so similar to Hysteria except for the fact that this album is weak Steve Clarke passed away in early jan,1991 and what a huge loss he was such a great guitarist. This album lacks power, passion and its way to ballad heavy too poppy. Lets Get Rocked has to be the worst song in Def Leppard's catalogue i know its nice to gave guilty pleasure songs but that song is just god awful. Go back and listen to High N Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria to hear good Def Leppard but please avoid this crap."
2,The End is here...,"When John Bonham died...Led Zep called it a day...when Steven Clark died Def Leppard should have.This ablum is the Hysteria scrap heap (admittedly so by the band)...The band lost is chemistry (and all ability to write wicked riffs) when their most talented member, Clark, passed away. A true shame that one of the greatest bands ever continues to destroy their legacy because there is money to be made.Save your cash and buy High N' Dry, Pyromania and Hysteria...3 incredibly great albums.Joe Elliot said that after Hysteria (albeit much after) they could have released an album of Bee Farts and sold millions....Adrenalize has sold over 7 million copies...for an album so bad and so out of place in 1992, that speaks volumes for DL's enormous popularity in the late 1980's."
3,"""White Lightning"" is the one track that electrified me.","3.5 stars.A friend of mine made me a Def Lep mix that was almost all-around great from top to bottom. I told him that he should send it to the DL boys and have them release it as some type of alternate retro review. It was quite good. He also gave me ""Adrenalize"" and that...did not knock me off my feet. After several listens I come away from ""Adrenalize"" as a fun rock album that doesn't take itself seriously. It's just out to primarily have a good time. Nothing wrong with that.I was most impressed with the confident, progressive-leaning ""White Lightning"". Great guitar atmospherics and work on this track. Favorite of the bunch. I can listen to that track repeatedly. But a couple of songs made me groan (not in to be confused with in a good way) like the simpering ""Make Love Like A Man"". All in all it maintained it's late '80s/ early '90s feel and gloss of male ""I want you"" love song pablum."
1,Pop rock toilet crap,"Just bubblegum radio friendly garbage. No talent, just poppy, polished turds aplenty. I fail to see how this band got popular as the only somewhat decent album they ever made was Pyromania and even that only had like two good songs that weren't run of the mill pop garbage. Funny thing is they are still playing effortless radio, pop crap today except it's much worse sounding.....they even play with taylor swift."
4,Adrenalize,"I've been a Def Lep fan since I was a kid, and their music has had an influence over a lot of musicians...This was their first album that was released after the death of Steve Clark, although most of it was written while he was still alive. It's as sweet as sugar (pardon the pun)and all 10 tracks have a great feel...the album still put out quite a few singles. Highlights are ""Let's Get Rocked"", ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad"" and ""White Lightning"". The guitar work of Phill Collen was incredibly impressive as he handled all of the guitar duties. If you listen closely you can always hear about three or four guitars doing different parts in the songs. Although not as successful as Pyromania or Hysteria, Adrenalize belongs in any rock collection."
5,Another Great Roar Of The Leppard,"ADRENALIZE is the fifth great Def Leppard album in a row. It also adds some new wave influences on ""Personal Property"", but the rest is standard, no-nonsense, four-on-the-floor pop-metal. This may not be the first Leppard album to get, but it is one of the most satisfying."
5,"Not Their Best, But Better Than Anyone Else","This album falls short of their new one, ""Euphoria"" or the previous ones like Hysteria...I even like the B-sides on Retroactive more, BUT this album still kicks and is worth the bucks. This IS Def Leppard afterall...no one does it better. And this album has sold 5 million copies. The best tracks are: Let's Get Rocked, Heaven Is, Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion), and White Lightning."
2,Not taking any chances,"I watched the VH1 special ""Ultimate albums"" on pyromania a little while ago. In the interviews they talk about how music in 1983 was stale and people were looking for something new. Def Leppard took a chance with Pyromania and it paid off big time. When it came time to record their next album, they took their music in another direction with Hysteria. In the making of Hysteria special, they talk about how everyone was still remaking pyromania, and when Hysteria came out it was a shot in the arm. Taking a chance once again paid off for Leppard. That's the problem with Adrenalize. They remade their previous album and didn't try anything new. Music in 93 was changing and Def Leppard put out the same album they did in 1987. Maybe if they would have made a heavier album like Retro Active. Re-record some of those songs and making a rockin' album. Who knows. Adrenalize is just a cheesier, less good version of Hysteria, produced not to change music, but to make some money."
2,Another poor black metal project,"When I heard about a new Dimmu Borgir members project I thought to myself: ""Wow! It would be great! They will never play bad Black Metal."" As soon as I purchased it I was really disappointed. It sounds like Astennu and Nagash never wrote music for Dimmu Borgir albums. CT is nothing else like another plain Black Metal band that plays boring music without melody and atmospheric influence. It's no use listening to this album. Astennu had better concentrate on Dimmu Borgir than making his own unsuccessful projects."
2,A disappointment,"The series was awesome, but the CD? It really could have done with at least something from the series soundtrack, like even the original start and end themes are absent from the cd. The sketches are a bit of fun, the sound quality is excellent, apart from the sound clips of the General which really could have been better.It's be great if they would release an album with background music from the series, so you can pop it in your car fire up the V8 and go blasting down some dirt roads screaming ""Yee-haaa"" out the window!"
4,Dukes Soundtrack - Yeehar!!,"I thought it was pretty good but the best track for my money has to be ""Flash"" because it's so funny and true!! I loved ""In the Driver's Seat"" as well and think that the whole thing is pretty good, so put them chairs in the wagon and shake them trees back to Hazzard y'all!!"
4,Good ol' stand-in songs,"Would've given 5 if the ORIGINAL music from the show was included as well. Talkin' about the original ""Good ol' Boys"" theme, maybe the Waylon version single, end title, and incidental action music during the show, especially during chases. What we all have here is nice, very nice, a fine selection, but the running time (around 40 minutes) leaves plenty of room for more chitlins and polk."
1,I got mine autographed by Catherine Bach!,"This is not a soundtrack to The Dukes of Hazzard, but rather an album with songs sung by cast members. Most of the actors can't sing, although John Schneider and Tom Wopat have decent voices. One of the most disappointing things about this CD is that the Dukes of Hazzard theme song is not performed by original artist Waylon Jennings, but is instead by the generic ""Hazzard County Boys"". Other than that, the rest of the album is pretty bad. ""The General Lee"" is one of the worst songs ever recorded by the great Johnny Cash, sung from the point of view of the Duke Boys' car. There is a terrible cover version of The Band's classic ""Up On Cripple Creek"", sung by Tom Wopat. The rest of the songs are all originals, and none of them are any good. This album will only appeal to hardcore Dukes of Hazzard fans."
1,Very little information,The book gives little to no information per page. Then there are very few pages. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
1,"Dear Amazon, Please Take this book off your shelves","The only audio book I've NEVER been able to finish, written by the only man I would like to see depart the educational world along with the university. This is a degrading piece of trash to any 'doctor' out there. Just take a visit to UMass Lowell and see the impact this book has caused on its students.Textually, I have reason to believe Mr. Moylan intended the 3-paged first draft as a children's book, then discovered a thesaurus while using the book as a counterweight to his pompous ego. Roughly translated, this book breaks down into ""Beatles are God, Worship Them.""I fully do not recommend this book or the program at UMass Lowell as an educational expansion of knowledge in any form.~Best of Luck Mr. Moylan~"
4,"A very thorough textbook, not a gentle introduction","This is a very thorough mixing textbook. The author goes far beyond the usual mixing book by establishing techniques and vocabulary for describing all aspects of sound. I'd recommend it to college students, music or audio professionals, and serious amateurs.Although the book has useful content, it is highly technical (thankfully, no math), so it may not be appropriate for some readers. Also, either the author's style was dense, or I'm dense (probably both)."
4,Advanced reading but should be on every engineer's shelf for reference,"If you are just starting out in the field of music production this book might put you off at first. The style of writing is not the easiest to digest, but if you devote some time to it and carry out the exercises provided inside on a consistent basis you WILL benefit from it. It takes years of experience and accumulation of knowledge to wear the hats of producer, engineer and musician successfully, so you will want to revisit this book along your journey to gain fresh perspective on the topics the author delves into."
1,"10"" ECLIPZE anti-UV sun umbrella - Sage Green","The shipping was quick; and the color looks very nice; but, that's about all the positive comments that I can provide; becasue the umbrella stoped working after one day; It did not stay open, the sections kept folding backward, I had to keep opening them every other second; since I threw away the packaging that's why I could not return it; I was very disappointed."
5,Greatest resource ever,"If you need to find a doll or a mark this book is for you. Wonderful, found exactly what I was looking for. Robin"
2,encyclopedia of dolls,"The book was not up to my expectations. Would have liked more variety and usable information. If I had seen the book beforehand, I would not have bought it. The seller, however, was very 'on top' of everything, and quick to ship."
4,A wonderful invitation to meet the many faces of the Goddess,"I bought this set because I have loved Hrana Janto's artwork for years. This book and card set complement each other very well. The book offers insight into the mythology of each Goddess as well as rituals for inviting that aspect of the Goddess into your life. I would and have recommended this set.Also, if you feel a *very* strong connection to one of the pictures, Hrana Janto has some available as prints!The only flaw I noticed was that a couple of the goddesses were more caucasian than I had ever seen them pictured. This point is not enough to detract from the set because Ms. Janto was very much inclusive in her visions of the Goddess."
4,A great contestation of the liminalities,"Professor Colker is a bisexual woman with a wandering eye. Being not-quite lesbian, and not-quite disabled has pushed her to ask questions about the murkiness of categorization. In this book, she dedicates a chapter to the ""bi's"" of race, gender, sexual orientation, and ability. This is mainly a legal text, but I think non-legal readers will still be entertained. I wasn't bowled over by this book, but I think it is great that someone is speaking of multiracials and bisexuals in the same breath and looking at the grey areas across categories. This book is a must have for various ""bi"" activists."
3,NOT a biography ...,"If you are looking for a comprehenisve biography of Visconti, this is not the book for you. It is a (fairly interesting) analysis of his films from an academic point of view. Undoubtedly a good resource for students of cinema, but those looking for something that would place Visconti's work within the context of his life, and give information about the development and production of his films, will be disappointed, as I was."
3,An interesting book...,"The back of the book says:Shock didn't describe Rachel Dillard's feelings when her estranged husband told her the news: her precious embryo had been stolen! A child- their child- had been born and had become a pawn in a killer's deadly game. Finding their baby was her priority now, but the familiar heat of Jared's arms was proving a dangerous distraction...One touch of Rachel's lips and Lieutenant Jared Dillard knew he'd do anything to have her back in his bed. Bringing their baby home was the first step. Stopping a murderer was the second. And if risking his life was the only way, he would prove the power of a father's love...This book was sweet, but there seemed to be some back story that I was missing. I enjoyed watching these 2 characters find threir way back to each other and I definitely recommend it to those who like a romance/adventure. There wasn't a lot of mystery and that is what disappointed me the most."
1,Fragments of thoughts,Not a story but pieces and fragments of dreams and thoughts. I found this book strange and not interesting enough for deep and long thinking; too much mind work for a book; I wouldnt mind if it were enjoyable in some sense but I did not find it so.
4,Reno Rib Fest,Was very impressed with live performance and needing something to listen in the rental car on the trip to Sacramento purchased this album and Guilty. To me being somewhat older the latest is more polished and easier on the ears.
5,these stories are eerily powerful,"Tobias Wolff, in this collection, gives up short snippets of ordinary people's lives. And yet the stories, themselves, have an eerie, almost transcendent power to them. It's as though the telling of these events, with a keen eye for the hard-to-see significance lurking underneath the surface, lends them a sort of magical gravity. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the seemingly mundane things permeating everyone's everyday lives may very well have a greater meaning. Not a readily discernible moralizing kind of meaning, but glimpses of what is true. I suppose it takes as sensitive an eye as the one Wolff possesses to discover those truths. I'm glad he at least shared a few of his insights in this collection."
4,Good Change of Pace,"I normally don't read short stories. They're often a little too compressed for me and perhaps a little obtuse. I know that's a terrible generalization but I prefer novels, especially thrillers of some kind. But I chanced upon this collection of short stories by Wolff and totally enjoyed them. Wolff is a careful, skilled and very able writer who can take seemingly ordinary people and turn them into memorable characters. As the book jacket says, Wolff's characters ""stumble over each other in their baffled yet resolute search for the 'right path.'"" That seems to be the essence of each of these terse but pithy stories and that sentence sums it up better than I could. I enjoyed the book. Who knows, maybe I'll start reading more short stories..."
5,Magnificent,I am amazed with everything Tobias Wolff writes.His fiction is as strong and deep as his non-fiction. In Pharoa's Army is the most profoundly human book I've read on the subject of soldiering in Viet nam.
3,Good short stories......,"The best, tremendous, practically perfect, one of my favorites? Thats what everyone says in their reviews about Tobias Wolff''s short stories.""In the Garden of the North American Martyrs"" is a quality collection, but alot of the writing is dry and outdated.Compared to other collections of short stories, Wolff's collection just doesn't match up.These stories were written between 1976 & 1981 and that explains alot. Several of the stories are really dull and the topics really leave off without grabbing your attention.Those stories that I did enjoy:WingfieldPoachingThe LiarAlthough this book didn't wow me, I'm looking forward to reading his newer short story collection ""The Night in Question"""
2,Nice Collection. Wish I could read it!,"Upon recieving this in the mail, I was so disappointed to see that the entire book is printed in 8 point font. My eyes just can't handle this. It's like reading a 600+ page footnote. The text literally comprises only half the total page area. It's a wonderful collection, but I'm afraid I'll be returning it."
1,Don't Buy This Edition,"The copy of this edition that I received was filled with misprints, including strings of random characters. The essays are not divided up as units; instead, the book is divided into what it calls sections which seem to cut up the material with no particular organizational principle. The titles of the chapters are not even included. And lastly, the footnotes are crammed amidst the text so that it is nearly impossible sometimes to distinguish that they are footnotes. Buy a different edition. (I wanted to give it no stars but Amazon requires that at least one start be given.)"
4,A New Way of Understanding the World,"It may not be the ""answer to everything"" but Spiral Dynamics helps to put a context around why people act in certain ways when presented with certain life conditions. Using the theory of memetics (idea viruses), spiral describes the evolution of humans as a progression from one value system to another along a double helix spiral. Pitched to those in management or leadership, Spiral Dynamics offers insights as to why some people need traditional or hierarchical or ordered or opportunistic or caring or project based workplaces depending on their value meme. The text can be stilted and academic at times and the introduction is confusing, however there are some great insights and well worth reading if you are interested in finding the answers to everything! Pity the colour plates from the hardcover were not replicated in the paperback seeing how Spiral Dynamics relies on the use of colour descriptors."
4,deepening your understanding and acceptance,"This book presents a unique and intriguing perspective on human development and evolution across life conditions, cultures, communities and personalities. Beck offers some insightful common sense and expanded perception approaches to the problems of both family, community, corporate and country discord. on a down to earth personal level it will give you a new understanding of where people are, what they are dealing with and why they make the choices they do. If you are interested in conscious evolution it will give you a means through which to assess your own and others current dominant value structures and how to customize your approach to precipitate change and growth along the spiral tragectory of evolution. A large section in the middle speaks primarily to corporate and country systems."
4,Highly informative on the evolution of civilizations and human beings in any age!,"not essential but a lot of this stuff is the basis for target marketingby Madison avenue and internet gurus using social pysch to con yoout of your money for crap you probably don't need.Thumb through it on Amazon and see what you think. Good, a bitinteresting but not essential outside marketing or political activism."
4,basic book for memetic studies,"This book came to my attention through reading Ken Wilber's books. For all interested in his All-Quadrants-All-Levels model the information offered in Spiral Dynamics is fundamental to map the levels presented in Wilber's 4 Quadrants model. This book also has much practical information useful for teachers,psychologists, business coachers,social assistants,managers and anyone that deals with group dynamics [In other words: everyone, because all of us interact in several groups in our lifetime].Thereare several books about memetics (after Richard Dawkins ""meme"" concept),but this one still is a milestone. I give it four stars because it is repetitive sometimes [perhaps deliberatedly,as a teaching device]."
3,Genius Theory / Dreadful Performance,"The Spiral Dynamic theory is genius. However, I only gave this audio book three stars for the following reasons:1. Don Beck should have had someone else do the reading. Seven hours of his voice ""reading without any inspiration"", is difficult. I almost fell asleep in the first 5 minutes (listen to the sample clip from amazon..you'll hear what I mean)2. Repetitive: Don Beck is unorganized in his thoughts and repeats himself. This 7 hour audio could have been done in 2.5 hours. There is something to be said about being concise.Again, the theory is worth learning...Just not through Don Becks audio book (try his written book)."
4,"Loved it, changed the world for me.","I could go on and on about the insight I gained reading this book. Beck gets a bit heady at times and I got lost, but for 80% of the book I was tuned in and learning. He uses loads of examples to illustrate his ideas and this held my attention.This book is not so much a philosophy, but a human management book. The management of change he details can be applied to one person, a family, a church, businesses large and small, governments, unions etc. I can now look at the media in the US and see right into values of the talking heads. It makes ideology transparent, and helps explain motivations for behaviors and beliefs that seem irrational.If your interested in understanding what all the change is about in our post modern world, this book will help."
5,Quite a tool to use for the future.,Spiral Dynamics has proven to be used by our church members as the future is contemplated and planning for the future.
1,Save your money!,"Reading this book was like gawking at a terrible car accident. You know you should look away, but you just can't help yourself. The charecters are one dimensional and the plot predictable. Not even the romance side of the story is enticing. In addition, the way Kohana referred to himself in the first person, ""KOHANA LOVES THE WAY MARILLA LOOKS..."" sounded like a very bad Tarzan movie. I only finished this book only because I was stunned that someone actually published it."
4,Ahhhh the work of Cassie Edwards!,"With a background like Cassie Edwards' has no wonder she was drawn to writing Indian Historical Romances! This book is a Cassie Edwards classic. However, it's Lieutenant's daughter falls in love with the big bad prisoner that no one should go near. However, daughter defies father and his troops to do just that and even goes so far as to steal the cell key and sneak into the said prisoner's cell to be with him! I like all of Ms. Edwards books that I have gotten my hands on. This one is no exception!"
4,Buy the Cd not the Mp3,The album is great and unique. It's not your every day typical Xmas songs. But the Mp3 Download from Amazon is terrible! It sounds like an old record being played on a victrola while being recorded on a tape recorder.
2,The Most Depressing Christmas Record Ever,"My parents owned this album and played it every year at Christmas when I was growing up. I accidentally heard parts of it again recently and realized that the dirge-like arrangements make it easily the most depressing collection of Christmas standards ever recorded. It's beautifully made, just depressing."
4,A great Christmas album,I've wanted this album since it was released in 1961. I was a struggling student then and LPs were way too expensive.The boys do a good job and put some real gusto into it. You can tell they were having fun.
1,Weak,"This was a disapointing CD. The song selection was not that good. Original and not often recorded Christmas songs are rare, but they need to be good, these were not. The songs just seemed to droan on and on. None of the snap these guys are known for. The second problem is the way it was recorded. While I am no big fan of Mega Bass Surround sound, this CD sounded like it was recorded in a tin room with tin instruments. It was just so thin I found that I had to crank up the bass and I rarely do that.If you like Folk Christmas music one of the best one's at Amazon is ""Christmas with the New Christy Minstrels: Complete."" 2 CD's in one case and the first one is absolutely fantastic. Mostly original songs that are good, upbeat, and Christmas sentimental but no droaning on and on. Better recording quality too. Check it out."
5,ain't it funky,jb was dynamite you want funk live uncut raw from the godfather and his disciples get this.
5,The funk of ages for all ages...,"It's hard to expand on the other reviews in an original fashion, but I'll try. ""Star Time"" whetted my appetite originally for this album, with the teaser 'Brother Rapp/Ain't it Funky Now' on it's 3rd disc, but you really have to buy this album and listen to it all the way through to truly appreciate what you're listening to......which is to say, the definitive live funk experience; especially if you haven't been fortunate enough to catch Mr. James Brown in concert. This may be the closest I'll ever come to it, but you could do much, much worse."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE,this is great. It last all day and it really makes your eyes pop. very good product. I am def going to get again
3,weak and redundant,"i'm a huge fan of the rough guide series, but this one just doesn't do justice. if you're considering this one, go for rough guide to cumbia (5 stars for sure) or samba (5 stars as well). If you just like a good beat without the fancy dancing i recommend the rough guides to afro-peru or central america, both unique and worth your time and money."
4,"Horses, Nine Stories of Harness and Saddle","I really enjoyed this collection of short stories... each one in a different place in time, told with ""vintage style"" language. They speak of the use (and misuse) of horses, and while the author ""humanizes"" the subject horses at times, these tales paint true pictures of the roles that horses served, and still perform to this day."
5,The Reference Disc for your Surround System,"Did you step up and buy high resolution, full bandwidth speakers for all surround channels - Center, Left, Right, Left Surround, and Right Surround? Listen to this record and you'll be glad you did. When performance artistry and recording craft of the highest level are combined with this highest resolution release format, the sonic result is stunning. I love this album. I love these mixes. Use this disc to shake-out and tweak any audio system. More importantly, and hopefully more often, reach for this disc to sit, listen and feel the music."
2,Different,Not what I expected. I personally would not purchase again. Just did not enjoy the music or the beat. But that is just my opinion. I know others did like the DVD.
1,"Non-receipt of ""The Turning Wheels"".","I still have to receive this book, ordered in the third week of December 2012. When can I expect to get it?"
3,This book is full of history,"I had to read this book for school. I usually just skim the books I read for school, but this one I had to read because there were no cliff notes. Much to my suprise this book wasn't as boring as I expected. It gave an indepth look into the formation of a nation and the devolopment of a socitey that was forced to form behind closed doors. The characters in this novel are very strong and sensitive. Many of the events that took place in the novel were actuall events that happened in real life and the author did an excellent job tying the events into the lives of the characters.I recomend to read this book even if you don't have too, it is a great story that is combined with actual history."
3,Out dated,"The third quarter of this book was very gripping and moved quickly. Then it started to get bogged down a little, but the characters were compelling enough to keep me reading. However, the book really showed it's age when it got to the interactions between the Israelis and Palestinians. The author's treatment of Palestinians/Arabs was pretty crude. They are consistently depicted as barbarians with no respect for human life, including their own. I wish Uris could have treated the Palestinians with some compassion. This would have made the book both more informative and more compelling."
3,The cover is broken,The cover is broken and the book is very old. All esle is fine. So I am not going to return it because anyway it is published in 1950s.
2,Long and boring,"I have had this book in my line-up for quite some time. Every time I looked at it as a possible read I just got a sense that it would be uninteresting. Well, I have to say that my fears were warranted. This book is almost as long and arduous as the plight of the Israelites. The story itself would be better off without the huge section of dull history stuck in the middle. I did become involved in the characters to a point, but never got a true feeling of realness in them. They just never completely developed. I do have to say that I came out with a better sense of the problems that the Israelites have had to face and I am sure that was the author's purpose."
2,A book too big for the story it tells.,"This book was ok. I read it for school, and I think it could have told the story in WAY less words. Uris concentrates too much on details than on the story he is trying to tell. I wouldn't recommend it, if you are 17......."
5,Great Book,"Although the actual story has some historical inaccuracies, it's a true masterpiece and a must-read for any zionist. It give us a deep perspective into the importance of the State of Israel, especially nowadays, when the whole world seems to forget the legitimacy and importance of the State of Israel."
3,The grueling melodrama ruins what could be outstanding,"This book is definitely hit-and-miss. On the one hand, it is full of fascinating mini-stories of Jews in the aftermath of WWII, and the struggle to establish the state of Israel. It's great just for the sheer historical value of the many monumental events it depicts, from stragglers emerging from Aushwitz to the first Arab conflicts to the world uproar surrounding the founding of Israel. The other side is that Uris has created as the main character a ridiculous Superman in the form of Ari that belongs in a comic book and detracts from all the realism that the historical background of the book creates. He is Godlike as a lover, caregiver, fighter, diplomat, farmer, spy, and anything else he undertakes. It the featured characters were more human in this otherwise very engaging novel of humanity, it would be five stars."
3,Interesting but incomplete and very dated,"The book started off promisingly. However, in the last part, I think the author got tired of his characters. In fact, it seemed like once he began his descriptions of the war, he forgot about them. Then he figured that he had to do something with them to end the book and generally killed them off. There were a number of stereotypes that detracted from the story. I kept wondering why the Israelis hadn't taken over the country quicker (and more easily) if the Arabs were as cowardly, ignorant, superstitious and dirty as the author portrayed them."
4,This edition is printed on very thin paper in very small typeface.,This is an excellent book that I have read several times. I have ordered this edition as a gift for a friend. This edition is printed on very thin paper in very small typeface. Nearly unreadable. Therefore I gave this edition only three stars.
2,"People really believe this stuff, kinda scary","Biased, historically inaccurate as it comes to Middle East issues, racist towards Arabs mostly. Amazing but people do take it seriously. Oy!"
4,Too Many Exclamation Points,"The twentieth century!The Ottoman's decline and the British ascent!World War I erupted!The British were reeling!Then came the final blow!Enough already!That last one's mine, not Uris'.This and other similar stylistic idiosyncrasies give Exodus a quaint and dated feel, kind of like the Donna Reed Show, with Yiddish overtones...Uris is by no means a great writer. Characters such as Mark Parker, Kitty Fremont, Ari Ben Caanan, and others come across as one-dimensional, even cartoonish.Nevertheless, this is an important book, a bestseller in its day (published in 1958) that first exposed a large segment of the US population to aspects of the history of the Jewish people leading up to the creation of the State of Israel.Reading it today is an interesting experience, providing as a by-product a window into post war America. In a sense, a book about one history has become a piece of another one.Recommended!"
5,Awesome,"Great book with some very important Israeli history thrown in for good measure. Definitely worth the read. Don't get overwhelmed by the number pages, they move quickly!"
5,Great historical fiction with much truth,"Although technically pure fiction, it contains much truth. It is a MUST read for those who wish to learn about Middle East history, while at the same time reading an exiting story. Mohamad Hassan"
3,Harry Potter was better,"This is the story of Jewish statehood with a few contrived characters awkwardly attached - like the miniature bride and groom on a wedding cake. The Jews were strong, courageous, beautiful, and full of sensual vitality. The Arabs were weak, treacherous, and motivated by hate and ignorance. In the end, the Jews achieved independence and the reader is assured the Arabs will regain their own cultural prominence once they resolve to follow the example set by the Jews. It's a nice story, but for historical accuracy, I'll stick with Harry Potter."
1,poore homework on Eastern European issues.,"A quick review. This was one of my biggest disappointments ever, and I am talking about the section of the book associated with Eastern Europe and especially with Poland. I wonder where the author's informations came from. The level of research is extremely poor on the subject and whatever came out of it is totaly misleading , ignorant and unacceptable. There are countless publications on the issue of Warsaw Getto, there is Institut of Jewish Studies in Warsaw with it's archives, huge amount of available studies.....etc. I am sure this was the last book of Uris I had in hand. This seems to be the best way to avoid being missleaded on the other subjects I am not so aware off"
2,To many pages,"This book has to many pages to tell us that story, the first part of the book, when Ari Ben Canaan rescue some young jewish boys and send them to Palestine is very interesting and it will have you reading all the time, but when the writer writes why Ari does what he does, and the biography of his life starts since his grandparents (that he never saw) is boring and boring, this part of the book is written in more than 100 pages, the second half of the book is worst, describes the story of the independence of Israel and the problems with the english army and all the arabs, this part of the book has more than 350 pages, this story is written in the book Jews, God and History by Max I. Dimont in less than 100 pages, so if you already read that book, you don't have to read this one.The ""love"" story of Ari and Kitty is not even a story."
4,Great historic story,"I reread this book recently and found the historical information very interesting. Mr. Uris was know for his extensive research and certainly did it for this book. The story takes place before my time so the background information on the wars, geography, politics, etc., were extremely useful for me. It is an epic story that includes many biblical references and spans thousands of years. The story is still changing today in real life. Some of the characters are a bit much but maybe for the time it was written they were appropriate. The story is engaging and made me question some of my education on this period of time. I have enjoyed most of Mr. Uris' books and will reread more of them as I have the time. This is well worth your time just for the historic information alone."
5,Excellent historical novel in compelling dramatic setting,Superb book. Painstakingly researched history of the birth of the state of Israel. Dramatic and fascinating characters. Uris is a magnificent story teller and historian.
5,Great story,Long but an enjoyable read. Great story about a tense time in our world history and beginnings of Isreal as a new nation.
2,Disappointing,This is a fascinating historical subject. Uris' writing does not do it justice. His descriptions of the settings are well laid out and detailed but his characters lack depth and believability.
2,too long by far,"the story of the exodus by itself is what attracted me, but the author went too deeply into background of many of the characters"
2,Sad,"Sad. To see all these people go nuts over nationalist tripe that is dangerously false on fact and brutally racist in tone does not bode well for the future of humanity, the Middle East or Jews and Arabs.This outdated work appeals primarily to Jews of East European personal or family origin where nationalism (as anyone who follows Yugoslavia and Chechnya or WWII central europe knows) is crude simplistic, violence-venerating, and myth-loving.Sad to see Jewish values submerged in a hack-novel tale designed to jsutify a claim to a piece of dirt in the Middle East by presenting it as a heroic resurrection of a people against others who lived there who are stereotpyed viciously."
1,Boooring!,"Exodus was the most boring book I have ever read! Most likely that is because I am not a history buff and that is exactly what this book had. Page after page of history. I really didn't need to know that much about the birth of Isreal. Anyway, if history is what you like read Exodus! If an interesting story is what you like, find something else to read!"
5,EXCELENTE LIBRO ESTA ESCRITO PARA VOLVER A LEERLO,"HE LEIDO ESTE LIBRO MAS DE UNA DECENA DE VECES Y CADA VEZ QUEDO TAN MARAVILLADA COMO LA PRIMERA, LEON URIS HA PLASMADO UN CONJUNTO DE HISTORIAS HERMOSA , CONSIDERO LA CREACION DE UN PERSONAJE COMO ARI BEN CANAAN EXCEPCIONAL ,DE LA MISMA MANERA TODOS LOS DEMÁS PERSONAJES PASANDO POR JORDANA, MALCOLM, SUTHERLAND AKIVA, BARAK,DAVID ENTRE OTROS ESTAN LLEVADOS CON UNA PERFECCION UNICA, SIENDO ESTE LIBRO UNA HERMOSA MANERA DE CONCER UN PEDACITO DE LA HISTORIA SOBRE LA QUE TODOS DEBEMOS REFLEXIONAR."
2,Good book until you actually think!,"When I read this book, I was quite captivated by it and could barely put it down. After I finished the book, I looked up some stuff and found out how grossly inaccurate it is about its ""historical events"" and how prejudiced it is against Arabs and British. If you read it as complete fiction, then it might be okay, but it should not be classified as historical fiction."
3,True Picture of Myth; Distorted Picture of Real Middle East,"For those who want to get a true picture of the origins of the myths that lead to uncritical support of Israel, here is your source. For those curious about reality, get a balanced portrait not influenced by Uris' anti-Arab racism or his regurgitation in a nice story of the myths the government of Israel uses to promote its interests. Sad, really, as his Holocaust sections can be moving but Uris' distorted pictureof the Middle East will undermine their worthier credibility."
4,Exodus,"Overall, I enjoyed Exodus very much. I liked the fact that it had many different and interesting characters that I could sympathize with. It was exciting and full of adventure, so I didn't ever want to put the book down. Most of all, I was intrigued by all the historical background. I don't think the novel would have been complete without it because it set the foundation for the events of the story and helped me understand the characters a lot more. I learned a great deal, and the information was presented in an interesting and easily understandable manner. I found some of the battle descriptions towards the end a little tedious and the ending disappointing and sudden. I thought too much was left unresolved. However, I would still recommend this book. I found it a fulfilling read, both intellectually and personally."
5,Exodus,"This is one of my all time favorite books. It is one of those rare books that you feel that you aren't the same after reading. It makes you take a closer look at yourself and question, what would I have done and would I have the strength and courage that the people of the story held? The book is well-written, making you visualize the story as if you are there. I walk away changed, with a new appreciation for the freedoms I enjoy and also of the sacrifices others have made."
4,Israel,"Excellent book. It tells us that this whole ""exodus"" thing isn't over yet.Excellently written. Israel will survive. I can recommend this book. Interesting and inspiring."
3,Over Weight,"This tool is simple to use, works well and built to last. However, if you intend to carry it along on your bike for adventure touring, consider an alternative tool. Made very (VERY) heavy of cast-iron, the Stop & Go Tire Bead Breaker is best left behind in your shop, unless you'll need an emergency boat anchor . . ."
4,A classic book for anyone interested in the CIA or post WW II,"The first half of this book is a textbook on how intelligence services operate. Written by a former CIA member it's quite an interesting read - if of course you are interested in the subject. It does read like a textbook in many places, as a warning to those looking for a spy novel. Having said that the second half of the book is the author recounting his experience running CIA ops in Hungary post WW II. This makes up for the dryness of the earlier chapters as well as providing practical examples as to what the author has been talking about. The second half id the desert after dinner."
2,Didn't work,"The product took 6 days longer to arrive than what was quoted. When I popped in the batteries, I noticed that the flashlight didn't work at all. Returned"
4,NICE COMBO!,"Solid build, laser zeroed easily and is one of the best I've seen for difficult day time targeting which still,as with all lasers, daylight always wins. A great tac light with alotta lumens! The light works by tightening the end cap and depressing the large base button. Or back it off 1/2 of a turn & press the button @ base and light is activated.I found that I actually use the base of the flashlight backed off for that half turn as a ""grip"",and, by applying slight pressure with my palm stability is increased while activating the light. In concert with the laser you can have a blast using this in the P.M."
5,Nothing better than OEM parts.,"They showed up in an AC Delco box, and they fit my '97 K3500. It's not shown, but there's also a 1/4 oz. pack of silicone grease included. I didn't bother changing the slide boots, and they work great. No squealing or rattling; the brakes don't pull or smell; and this time, I'll get some warning when they wear thin."
2,Pretty bad,"Billed asvery good. It has water stains and wrinkled pages. Oh well, it works for school but I am disappointed"
2,"""The Onion"" Offends Texas Librarian","Too much profanity! I would buy this book if it didn't have so many cuss words in it. I flipped through it at the library and it has some witty, hilarious stuff in it, but it makes me cringe to see the f-word, the s-word and worse on every other page. Here's hoping someday they will do a cleaned-up version for those of us who don't think potty language is too clever."
1,Cheap for whom???,"I tried a couple of recipes after getting this book from the library, I cannot find the savings in this book. She wants you to invest in some utensils that normal people just would not have in their kitchen. The type of things used in the recipes are neither cheap, nor do they hardly ever go on sale. I would reccomend sticking to the complete tightwad gazette, or not just beans before I would this!!!!"
3,Not Her Best Book!,"I am a huge fan of Mary Hunt, but I was not overly impressed with this offering. There are better ideas for saving money on food in some of her other books. If you don't have any idea on how to prepare less costly meals, this might be a good investment. Otherwise, stick to your BHG or Betty Crocker all purpose cookbooks. I do enjoy Mary's style of writing, though, and I especially enjoyed the section on the formal tea. But I am a pastor's wife, and often have to entertain--for a family trying to cut their everyday costs, that portion would be less than useful."
4,Interesting Song...Check It Out,"Actually I have this song on her ""Music"" album and I must say it is different. If you like Madonna you'll love this song!"
1,Horrid,"Madonna has lost it, where she used to be talented, but now shes lost it. This is the worst song Ive ever heard. Back to the drawing board Madonna."
2,A gamble that lost,"It isn't a crime to remix a slow song. Previous slow or mid-tmepo Madonna songs have been successfully remixed, like Secret, for example. The remixes here, though, are sort of a letdown. There isn't any distinct sound or feel, just a bunch of remix cliches by remixers who have remixed too many songs by now to really think about what they want to create.Sad to say, but I am dreading the remixes for the next single, What It Feels Like For a Girl. Another slow song, and the same remixers have been chosen!"
5,This Song is SO Cool!,I think this is the best Madonna song ever! I listen to it on the radio whenever it is on.I reccomend this CD!
4,Good dance remix,"Thunderpuss remixes are usually great ones. This dance mix of Don't tell me is the best remixed version of that song at my opinion. The radio edit is like the album version, but a little shorter, and the non-album track Cyber-Raga is like the Ray Of Light track ""Shanghi-Ashtangi""... So as a Madonna fan and a dance music lover, i think the thunderpuss club mix is the only reason this single should be bought."
3,Pt. 1 shines better,"One wonders what prompts Maverick Records to do these silly things in the overseas market. They never release Pt. 1s and Pt.2s here in the US, but in the UK almost EVERY Madonna single release has two or three different versions of it on CD.That said, the Pt. 1 CD of 'Don't tell me' is certainly better than this, the Pt. 2 CD release. Thats because Pt. 1 had 'Cyberraga', while Pt. 2 has just the Thunderpuss and Vission Remix (which is not a very good remix, either). I personally think that this is one song that should be left alone, unremixed. Tampering with it only spoils it, as this CD makes evident."
3,Nothing to write home about...,"If, by chance, you have never had to put together a resume this book will provide you with excellent step-by-step instruction. There is a section that assists in gathering the essentials of who you are and incorporating that information into a single document. There is also a portion of the book that provides a rather substantial list of ""action words"" to help you bulk up your resume. The resume samples are fairly decent, but not anything striking. They are definitely professional looking, but they probably won't make you stick out from the pack.Let me tell you, that I have just read through four resume books specifically aimed at teachers (this book, the one listed below, Resumes and Cover Letters for Teachers, and Real-Resumes for Teachers). If you want the ultimate book, you should take a look atExpert Resumes For Teachers And Educators (Expert Resumes)."
4,dogs LOVE them,My dogs Love this product. The quality is higher than other brands as I've tried most all of them. I guess this is why they are a bit more pricey also.Consistently a quality product. Just wait for super saver and free shipping-then it's a perfect deal!
5,chicken tenders,My puppy loves these. She does not like the stron treats available at your local stores. She will chew these for hours. Will buy again.
3,The Man In The Woods review,This book is mysterious and thrilling. It makes you think alot about your own actions. In the book a youg girls witnesses a crime and only she knows what has happened and she decides to investigate it on her own. It ends up that the criminal follows her on her investigations. This book is very suspensefull. I think it is a good book but i would recommend other novels before this one.
4,The man in the woods,"It all started when Helen chased man in the woods.She lost her locket with her mother's picture in it.Helen got the locket a couple days after with her mother's eyes pocked with red paper behind the picture.She and her friend named Pinky worked together on this and found about Lorenzo Fairchild and his doughter Lucy.Lucy,in the civil war helped South win the war..., This book was great and I think I'll read it again"
5,Extremely Nice,"It is a very nice looking watch. Bought as a gift. The watch is a little heavy but other than that, it is a really nice watch. The photos do not do justice to the actual watch, it is much better looking in person."
3,crazy people having fun,"Da Yoopers are well, different, comedy and good blend of vocals, this is not their best by far, the older cds are better and much more palatable."
3,Great for existing Budos fans,"If you are new to Budos don't start here. ""II"" and ""III"" are better in so many ways. ""Dig"" though, isstill a competent album and for existing fans a must-have to see the road they have travelled."
4,Budos Band Hotter than Hell!,"I saw Budos Band at Johny Brenda's here in Philadelphia and it was the hottest show I have ever attended, I mean it must have been a 100 + degree up in there! Oh and the music was too, hot that is! It is nice to see this Staten Island based band can still make a go of it despite the lack of commercial appeal. Playing a deep mix of funk, r&b, soul, laced with tinges of Ethiopian jazz these cats just lay down a solid groove and drive it home. I first heard them at the end of a bad chick-flick (whose name thankfully escapes me, I think it might have been I Hate Valentines Day?) and thought it was Mulatu Astatke or someone of his ilk. If you are a fan of this kind of music this will fit nicely into your collection, invest in this album now! *(for more on my music pics check out my site at [...]."
3,Dinah Washington - The Great Songs,"I got this disc for the song ""What a Diff'rence a Day Made,"" which,in Spanish is ""Cuando vuelvas a tu lado."" The song is an all-timefavorite of mine. I did not find the recording to be as clear asI would have liked. I'm keeping it, though."
3,Not as good as you may have heard,"When Jackie Oh! came out it shot Kitty Kelley to fame. It was considered vicious trash by the critics but the public ate it up. Reading it almost 30 years later I'm struck with the feeling that the hype was more than the book. There have been allegations that Kelly relied on backstairs gossip and a lot of what's in here can't be proven. Then there is the fact that Jackie was alive when the book was published. Kelly's decision to write about Jackie's treatment for depression (The woman lost a son and a husband within months. Who wouldn't be depressed?) seemed simply cruel for the sport of it.Reading Jackie Oh is kind of like finding your old high school year book and being embarrased by the clothes, the hobbies and the sentiments written therein. You look at it and are chagrined at how important such sillines seemed at the time."
3,Slanted for sensationalism,"This book is a fast read and very shallow. After just reading the Taraborrelli account of Camelot (Jackie, Ethel, Joan), this perspective comes off as a much lesser work and written without regard for nuance or context. I did like the fresh interviews and the general journalistic research the author seems to have done but got turned off by the sour flavor that saturates everything. Kelly seems bent on making Jackie look spoiled, remote and really kind of boring. This book doesn't do much in conveying a fair and accurate character portrait. It reads more like a tabloid novella. I give it three stars instead of two for the apparent research but I'm left feeling unsatisfied and annoyed."
2,There are better books out there,"This is not one of KK's best efforts. There is not enough detail. The book is too then for such rich subject matter. I really enjoyed The Royals and Nancy Reagan, but KK's efforts in this book are just so-so. For a better Jackie biography, read A Woman Named Jackie by David Heymann."
3,Disappointing,"Volume 2 of the Dreamwave series is a significant improvement from the trash that Chris Sarachini put out in Volume 1. However, compared to all of the comic runs based on the Transformers in the 80's and early 90's, this story is extremely lacking in substance. There are a lot of attempts at fan appeal , but the story just is not very compelling. If you are not already a fan of the Transformers, I would not recommend this book. If you are a rabid fanboy collector, you might want to pick this one up."
1,No Mac Support!,"I was told, when I bought this at Christmas, that it took a standard USB 2.0 cable, which is true, and that it would work with either my wife's PC or my Mac. It will Not work with a Mac -- no software available, and my wife has no USB ports available. I am going to have to purchase a hub for her PC, import files there, hopefully, and then move them to my Mac, which has software that will work with the sound files. Extremely inconvenient. Nothing on the package indicated it would only work with Windows; I wouldn't have bought it if it had. (I have found numerous posts saying that Mac owners have contacted Olympus about this. None have received Any responses!"
3,operating system,"To find no operating system in this sort of product in 2005, is quite amazing.This voice recorder, by analogy, is a four-channel tape recorder, on which one can make many note segments on each [of 3 of the] tracks. Once a note is made, one cannot add to it other than immediately. Otherwise subsequent associated notes are scattered on the 'tape' in time-order. One cannot add one segment to a note already made, nor transfer it from one channel to add to the existing record.Operating systems; starting from such as DOS; are so ubiquitous that one is brought up abruptly to find a modern device in which ""cut-and-paste"" has not been considered!!The voice recorder itself seems well-made and designed to be robust - but how 'shower-proof' is not described."
2,Could be MUCH better,"While it works great, you cannot convert the .WAV file using Microsoft Media Player. Oh, MMP will PLAY the file, but when you go to convert it to an MP3 or just burn the file directly to CD so you can play it in a CD player, it doesn't work. It says that it doesn't recognize the codec. Olympus was at a loss to explain the work around. What I ended up doing was purchasing a third (or fourth or even fifth, with as low tech as it turned out to be) party converter that was able to convert it without a problem. Why won't MMP convert? Because the Olympus .WAV file uses a proprietary codec--one that they will NOT send out. I was on the phone with them for over an hour trying to convince them that, no, it doesn't convert. The person I was on the phone with the longest had no clue about the proprietary codec.Anyway, if you want to use this product for your class notes, etc., it's a great product. Just don't expect to easily/quickly burn a usable CD with it."
5,Fantastic Book,"This book is really a ""life primer"" for how to communicate with people.Dr. Nirenberg's book is chock full of wisdom and humorous examples.If you've ever wondered why people say the things they say - and do the things they do - then buy this book!"
4,Never gets old,"I have to say that this CD is a very cool Cd that any true fan of music should have in their collection. ""Strong Persuader"" was the first Cd of Robert Crays that I owned and from there I have built up my collection. My favorite song on this disc is the title track, to me it is down and dirty blues music at its best. ""The Price I Pay"" is another slow blues tune that is also worth a good listen to. Other stand out on this disc are 'Just A Loser"", ""Won The Battle"",and ""He Don't Live Here Anymore"" If you own any other Robert Cray CD, add this to your collection."
4,Great fun at parties,"I originally bought this book to round out a $25 purchase and qualify for free shipping. It turned out to be a great investment. I read through it after receiving it, and 4 or 5 of the worst jokes have stuck with me ever since. They make good icebreakers at parties, and they're hilarious in the ""so bad it's funny"" sort of way."
3,Apenas correto,"Quando comprei esse CD esperava muito mais. Lazzara no é um mal cantor, mas também no é extraordinário. Sua voz é um pouco cansativa, soa forada, em falsete, com agudos desregulados e graves irregulares; em nenhum momento senti-me arrebatado pelo romantismo belliniano. Scholl, Daniels ou Blaze desencumbiriam-se melhor, mesmo considerando que estas pequenas canes ficariam muito mais bonitas cantadas por uma mezzo-soprano como Larmore ou Kasarova. A escolha do repertório é deliciosa e inclui algumas raridades como "" Pour la gloire..."" verso francesa para a a ária "" Se Romeo..."" de Romeo em I Capuleti e i Montecchi, e ""Tu che al piagner"" cuja melodia remonta ao dueto de Adalgisa e Pollione no 1 ato de Norma. Porém, em algumas canes como "" Per pietà"" ou ""Malinconia, ninfa gentile"" senti uma saudade profunda de Bartoli e de Jo (magnífica). Decididamente: vale apenas como uma curiosidade!!"
2,Pretty but not too good,"After a few days there were humidity spots inside the glass, and hte watch had not gone in direct contact with water"
2,what a disaster,"I borrowed two guide books from the library, had then special order this,,,,, what a bad guidebook, I am an experinced traveller and found this unusable for trip planning. This is what you get when you let eighteen year olds write travel guides. Give it a skip, and buy the frommers and use the internet to fill the blanks. I lead tour groups, and need decent information."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on this Book,"From the inaccuracies in the so-called historical review to the inaccurate descriptions of non-existent ""perils and pitfalls"" and the failure to describe the real areas of concern, it's hard to believe the author of this guidebook has ever been to Israel. Buy Frommers and use the on-line updates."
4,why all the hate?,"I've been living in Israel for about four months... saw this in my friend's room and fell in love with it! Seems to be very well-tied-in with the culture, pointing out interesting items ""off the beaten path""... Never saw the Frommer's but in any case this is a whole heck of a lot better than the Rough Guide I bought. Anyway, I'm going to probably buy this."
2,"Caution, teachers: Not for anyone needing help with grammar!","I was given this book on the first day of classes by my division head at my community college. In the past, we had always used the ""Simon and Schuster Handbook for Writiers"" Fifth Edition, which is a far better text.If your students are needing a text that will help them understand and learn grammar, punctuation, style, and referencing, Quick Access is not the text for them. The afore mentioned handbook, however, is. Once they have mastered the handbook, the Quick Access is perfect for someone who has knowledge of all the rules but might just occasionally need to check the odd thing or two. Keep this in mind when considering this text for either your classes or yourself."
3,Instructor's copy is NOT the same as student's,"The book itself is good. Some of the sellers are stating that the instructor's version is the same as the student's, this is NOT the case. The book itself *may* be the same or similar but the access code inside the book needed for some classes is NOT. It registers you as an EDUCATOR rather than a STUDENT and you are not able to access your instructor's area for your class.I bought an instructor's copy because it was a little cheaper and that was what most on [...] were selling. I am trying to straighten things out with the access code now. I have had to contact customer/account service and am awaiting their reply. Until this is fixed I have NO access to my class. I don't know yet if I will have to BUY another access code."
4,Cool CD!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this CD on a whim, and I am very happy that I did. As an avid collector of electronica/drum+bass/trip hop music, this cd is essential to my collection. If you like Tricky, Massive Attack, or Portishead then you will want to buy this one as well. Especially if you seem to have exhausted the aforementioned artists' material as I have. Tracks like 'Sweet Melody', 'Full of Echoes' and 'Stolen Letters' are my favorites. I liken this disc to 'Nightmares on Wax' meets 'Portishead'. Buy and enjoy this very underrated CD....have fun."
3,Goth+Electronics=Sneakster,"Sneakster is the sort of band that will remind you that trip-hop is nothing but goth music with better machines. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that their first album was released in the UK by the Cocteau Twins' label Bellaunion and in America by Shadow Records, one of the labels responsible for originally introducing trip-hop to the United States. The last four tracks are a bonus EP's worth or remixes and reinterpretations by the Cocteau Twins' own Robin Guthrie. Mellow, ethereal, cold, awesome music."
3,"A Useful, If Dated, Guide","This review is based on the 1965 hardcover edition published by Abington. If you have ever wondered why and to what extent churches fracture, this book provides a useful perspective. The 7 primary categories of churches and the relationship to mainline denominations is a valuable way to think about and organize the divisions in the church. Don't look for critiques or comparions of particular churches. However, once you see the author's way of organizing churches, you can plug in any particular church."
4,Not a bad book,"I am not overly thrilled with either of the VeggieTales books I have purchased - the other one being Peas and Thank you. This book is much better than Peas and Thank you, but I will say my grandchildren aren't interested in reading either book very often. I will say the illustrations are very cute."
4,Authur and the scare your pants off club .,Aurthur and his friends wait for a brand new Scare-Your-Pants-off club book.But at the libray all the books in that series had been banned so they try to find a way to get the books back.
1,Waste of time!,"I am not a big fan of Spike Lee's, but as soon as I first saw a preview for The 25th Hour, I knew I wanted to see this movie. I do like Ed Norton and he is the main reason for me wanting to check this flick out. What a huge mess. My wife and I kept watching it thinking something great or interesting was about to happen only to be slapped with more boring, uninteresting scenes. This could have been a great movie about a drug dealer who gets caught and has to find out who set him up. Instead we get a rambling bore of a movie where the main character's big idea to make it through prison is to have his friend ""make him ugly"" by beating him in the face...Stay away for your own good, I've lost 2 hours of my life I'll never get back again!"
1,the 25th. hour,this is not the war movie.this is a religous video.this should be made clear.the review i read sounded like the hard to find video (the 25th. hour)staring anthony quinn.reading this will stop returns.thank-you
2,Boring and unrealistic.,"This film, directed by legendary racist and ""Whitey-hater"" Spike Lee, and starring Edward Norton, is about a guy. Now, this isn't some regular guy, this is a guy with a pretty bad-@ss goatee. This automatically makes him awesome.Anyway...Edward Norton's character is being sent to prison for seven years. He has one last day to enjoy his freedom. Now, in real life the police would automatically take the man into custody and arrest him, but in Spike Lee's fantasy land, Norton's character gets one last day to do whatever he wants, whether that be to leave the country or to go on a murderous rampage. Norton's character, however, decides just to meet with his friends for a pretty lame party.Really, the ONLY good things in this movie are the ending and Norton's scene where he rants to himself while looking in the mirror.I give The 25th Hour two stars.**"
2,I was disappointed.....,"I gave 2 stars only because Edward Norton does his job, but I was disappointed at many of the words that could have gone unsaid, I hated the part where he ripped apart all of the different races, down to the Catholic church, and Jesus Christ, it was not called for. I was so turned off after that, that I didn't even finish watching it. It's too bad that Spike Lee would put out such garbage, I was one that believed that he had class....I was wrong."
4,Wow,"I'm NOT a fan of Spike Lee at all and had I known this was one of his movies, I NEVER would have rented it. However, I now take that back because this movie is amazing. I've had this movie on my ""list"" for years and finally got around to renting it. Not to ruin it but the best scene of the entire movie, and that moved me to tears, is a key moment between Ed Norton and Barry Pepper towards the end. Barry Pepper does an absolutley amazing job in this movie. I think Ed Norton is a superb actor but I didn't think he was right for this role. But his dad was great, that was another touching story line. And the dog, as an animal lover, that got me too. Highly recommend this movie."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I couldn't finish this film, found it so boring it got to my nerves. It's about a drug dealer in New York trying to come to terms with his jail sentence. Lots of guilt, sorry, melancholy - very little entertainment. I must admit I find nothing interesting in a New York drug dealer as a movie subject - in fact I find nothing interesting in big city life or drug dealers, respectively. So the drama goes out the window with that. And there's nothing left really to keep you entertained.I don't wanna bag the people who like this film, each to their own. Just wanted to express my own disappointment. It may even have been good, cos I stopped watching before halfway, there was nothing in it for me."
4,Good Movie,"I'm not a fan of Spike Lee's, but I found this movie to be very good. The whole cast did an excellent job telling the story, especially Norton. Spike Lee's ecelectic and artistic shots were fascinating to watch for that it alone the movie is worth seeing. I also liked how Lee did not shy away from talking about September 11 as other movies taking place in NYC have. Although maybe there isn't much to learn from the characters in ""The 25th Hour,"" it still is a trip worth taking."
1,stereotype on top of stereotype,"Watching this movie was a strange experience. The basic premise was intriguing and there were interesting moments throughout. However, When Philip Seymour Hoffman and Edward Norton leaves you flat, you know there's a serious problem. The characters were oddly shallow, unbelievable, and unlikeable. Spike Lee peddles in stereotypes - ethnic, gender, and class - and no one cares about or becomes invested in a paper-thin stereotype. The depictions of women were also sophomoric and annoying - Spike should just avoid pictures with female characters because he has no clue. He should consider movies about men in submarines, in male prisons, or male monasteries.i"
1,Slow paced + pointless plot = Total waste of time,"As you can tell from the title, I hated this movie. The pacing is excruciatingly slow. I don't mind if there is a payoff, but the plot wanders aimlessly. Even the stellar cast of Edward Norton, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Rosario Dawson, and Anna Paquin can't save this turkey."
1,Find another movie. there are way better movies out there !,"I was actually very excited about watching this movie. However, it tuned out to be a disappointment... I would give it a C-"
4,Yet another success on edward norton & spike lee,"Deffly a must see for any fan of spike lee jone's joints as he calls them. Edward norton is an incredible actor, incredile who also played as the incredible hulk lol no pun intended. this movie takes you on the heavy decesion that edward's character monty has ta take..if you ever lived through any hardships and need inspiration this to me is a great depiction on that..."
4,Both a good and bad film,"This Spike Lee film shares both good and bad elements, yielding in the end mixed and unresolved feelings about it. The acting is excellent, especially the performance of Edward Norton, but there is little change in emotion; there is a brooding feeling throughout the film's two plus hours as the drug dealing Norton character worries that he will need to report to jail for a seven year term within 25 hours, and as he is wondering whether it was his girl friend who turned him in to the cops. There is little else to the plot, other than his school teacher friend's sexual attraction to his under-age student, a subplot that is not developed; like the main plot, it discloses his anguish very well, but little else. If the presentation of brooding and anguish is the film's goal, the film is very successful. Yet, one might also wonder whether this could have been presented in a shorter version and whether another subplot should have been added."
1,Boring,I expected so much more....but then again...it is a Spike Lee film. Always boring and disjointed. The intro should have been a clue...
1,Dissappointed,"Unfortunately, the product was defected. I replied one of your e-mails offers mentioning this but I guess you didn't get the message. I lack of time and patience to go to the returning process so, since it does'nt happen that often I let it go. So I can't rate it. I couldn't watch it. It kept freezzing on me the whole time.Rita"
1,25 Hours Too Long,"I wouldn't walk my dog around on my last day of freedom. I wouldn't talk to my friends about random stuff on my last day of freedom. I wouldn't bad mouth the many different kinds of life on my last day of freedom. This movie was horrible! ""25th Hour"" is about a man named Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) who does all of those dreadfully boring things on his last day before he goes to prison for seven years. What a hoorah! Partying has never been so boring. Terrible movie."
1,An emotional wasteland,"I am an admirer of Spike Lee's work; also, Edward Norton. But no amount of acting makes up for a film in search of a plot. An audience can't have compassion for stereotypical characters who don't move them. This film is TRYING to be way too arty,and it sinks even lower with far too much flag-waving and gratitiousviolence. What a waste of an evening; save yourself the time and don't fall for this one, no matter what the reviewers promise."
1,BORING,"Very well acted and well shot. Nothing happens. You keep waiting for something interesting, but it never comes along. Besides which, it has this confusing conceit of a man who's been sentenced to jail, but then he gets some time on the outside to say goodbye to people and possibly escape if he wants. It may be that this does happen in the criminal justice system, but it flies so counter to what i'm used to (you get convicted, you go straight to jail) that it just made it hard to take in. Save your money. there are so many better movies with the same people (Lee, Norton, Hoffman, Paquin...)"
1,a flat movie,"Am I supposed to feel sorry for this guy? I suppose the other main plot was who turned him in. The movie was just flat. No peak, no climax...jst flat."
2,just average,Spike Lee is one of the Most Creative Directors in the Business but more often than not He gets Cluttered with so many ideas&then loses steam with alot of His Films.He has a tendecy to add a few to many story lines without fully dealing with the Main One.Edward Norton does a Decent Job here but He gets Bogged down here in this film.this Film had some good ideas but after a while you are trying to remember who&waht is going on.this should have been a Knock Out film as to Being a Film that just has alot of ideas but very litle Proper Direction.
3,25th Hour,I love this movie because of Ed Norton's performance. He is one of my favorit actors. I would like to see him have more parts.
3,My wife liked it more than I did,"Without getting into heavy stereotypes about gender differences in movie preferences, it says something that my wife liked this more than I did. I was expecting something a bit more action, a bit more suspense, a bit more convaluted; she was intrigued by the characters, the interactions, the relationships.A fine movie, just not what either of us expected - and more to her liking."
5,Lo-Keyed Anti-Drug Saga-Slash-New York Drama...,"...Spike Lee's directorial restraint should be heralded, because instead of bloating the text of the movie with un resolved issues, he presented a nice decent story with a more or less straight forward presentation. Rosario Dawson as Naturelle gives an stellar performance as well as Brian Cox as Monty's (Edward Norton) father. The last 20-30 minutes of the film is great cinema that 'will' make you choke a bit. Edward Norton also redeems himself from ""Death to Smoochy"". See it and enjoy."
3,this cut is cool still,"Fat Joe is a trip because while I can't even get into a whole album by him, i do like some of his catchy cuts and this is one of them. I stil trip out at the video because it seemed as if he had all of the then UPN tv show cast members in the video. Ashanti was cool on the Hook. this was a catchy joint back then and it still is crackin."
5,Rockin',"This cd is a steady 133 beats per minute and is wonderful! - Talk about speeding up a workout. I never knew I was going so slow. Another one that is fun to listen to before, during or after a workout. Fun!"
4,Fun ride with the big voice,"This cd is a fun ride with the big voice of Omar Dykes from Omar & The Howlers. I have his first recording Big Leg Beat that featured horns and the swing sound back in 1980 and I was thrilled for him to revive his original sounds. Guest musicians Derek O'Brien and David ""Fathead"" Newman keep these tracks fresh and fun. I've been a fan of drummer George Rains since he was with Boz Skaggs on ""Loan Me A Dime"" and he's surely hasn't lost his pace on Omar's Swingland. I can't wait to see what Omar has instore for us next."
1,Buyer Beware!,Buyer Beware! This is not a genuine Epson cartridge. Very misleading description. Would not recommend.
3,Pretty Good,"The crimes are solved because of good police work. McBain interweaves the investigation of serial killings with the detectives personal lives.As the story progresses, we learn that the victims of the serial killer were not very nice people . This part is interesting. I wasn't very interested in the personal lives of the police dectives . McBain always writes clear prose and the story is good."
3,Good,"This kind of novel is a little off the beaten path for me, but I had always wanted to read a McBain mystery, and now having done so, I'm glad I did. Good light reading featuring very human ""good guys"" and a villain with a credible back story."
2,Soso,"This book was confusing to read and I nearly gave up twice. (I just had nothing better to read at the time.) There were too many characters including 3 pairs of pretty much interchangeable police detectives. I couldn't keep them straight; one pair would have been fine. These rather two-dimensional detectives were only slightly broadened by a series of one-sentence discussions of their personal problems. The author changed venues and characters every few pages making for a very disjointed read. This deliberate discontinuity did not serve to increase the suspense; it was just irksome. The book is titled ""Fiddlers;"" the first guy killed is a violinist; the nightclub, Ninotchka, has strolling violinists; the hooker, Reggie, describes ""singing about fiddlers;"" and, at the end, the killer accuses his victims of having ""fiddled"" with his life. Oh. Yeah, I get it."
3,A Too Dark Tale From a Legend,"I have read 87th Precinct novels for 45 years and always enjoyed them. I didn't dislike this one but have no trouble believing it was the author's last work. It is very dark and focused on our mortality. His own looming death was obviously on the author's mind as he wrote this story. It doesn't bother me that death is so much a part of part of the book, that's to be expected. It's that depression clings to the whole book. I was kind of sad the author went out on this note."
5,"A ""WOW"" Conclusion to a Great Series","I was so happily surprised by ""Fiddlers"" and I can only hope that every great writer leaves a great one as their last work. The story brings together the usual cast of the 87th Precinct Novels as they focus their energies on chasing a serial killer who appears to indiscriminately targeting older people of different genders, vocations, and status in life. As usual there is the plethora of back stories dealing with the police detectives and their personal and private stories. I am guessing that the author (in real life ""Evan Hunter"") knew this was to be his last book, because, though there are still loose ends in the storylines, they are all satisfying ones that do not quite leave us hanging in a bad way. I wonder also if the author was not getting back (via the fictional murders) at some people in his own life.Regardless, this is a page turner, a tribute to a great author, and though there will be more...he truly left on top!"
3,Another disappointing end-of-career 87th Precinct book,"I do wish Ed McBain had stopped writing the 87th Precinct novels before he went into a decline. This is the second of his later 87th works and they just don't have the dialogue or the tight writing or the characterisation which marked his best works like Fuzz or 80 Million Eyes. McBain's going through the motions here. The once delightful repartee between Carella and Meyer Meyer hardly exists and the storyline is lame. Occasionally the plot picks up pace and you think ""Oh yes, I remember why I so used to like reading these books"" and then it fades away in shadows of what produced at his peak. If you're a big fan of McBain, this is not really worth reading."
3,It's Ed McBain,I love the 87th Precinct novels & this one is great.There are 5 murders commited in different Precinct's but all end up in the 87th. And one by one they figure out who the killer is. If you like the 87th Precinct novels you will like this one.
4,"No Live in Australia, but really good","I think Elton John should have just left disk one on this live album. The second one is not as good and has little emphasis on the piano. John Lennon's voice is mellowed out by Elton's (which sounds scratchy).Anyway, disk 1 is awesome, though. This would be my favorite Elton live album if it were just that.I love this album though. It is a great album, just sounded too desperate.. mainly because it was contractually due... but hey, can't blame a guy for trying, right? And he pulled it off"
3,"Very good, but ...","A very good CD, with There (CD2, New York) being slightly more enthusiastic than Here (CD1, England). But, for those only pursuing a live Elton record vice everything Elton, I would strongly strongly recommend Live In Australia (with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra) rather than Here & There. Live In Australia is incredibly powerful all the way through with beautiful songs & outright rock'n'roll. Your choice."
2,broad range of selections reveal elton john's artistry,"The melodies are great, elton is great, the words are evocative, but I found the arrangements and the recording balance emphasize the drum too much, which ends up compromising all of the above good things. Can the songs be remixed? hope so."
4,Need to explore further,"Quite frankly I was so blown away by ""Skyline Pigeon"" the first time I heard it on this album that I gave short shrift to the rest of ""Here and There."" This album's version of ""Skyline"" is devastating."
5,the greatest live album ever recorded,"I acknowledge the bias that comes with these reviews -- you wouldn't be writing if you didn't like the music. Having said that: this REALLY IS the greatest live album ever recorded. And I've heard a lot of them.Time, place and audience come together on both of these discs. If you own even one Elton John album, it should be this one. And then you will find yourself looking for tickets his next time through town."
4,Soundtrack,"The movie was adorable and hilarious. I absolutely loved the soundtrack, but I can't find it anywhere!? I even tried looking for the individual songs, and that's difficult too. Does anyone have a clue where I can find it at?"
1,Poor Service from Seller 'dvdlegacy',I am not able to review the product I purchased because I never received it from seller dvdlegacy.
3,Young people and dealing with the world,The ribs delivery guy meets a rich lady who fancies him.He meets the girl friend of a jealous middle linebacker.His uncle has an 80's recording studio that is in trouble.The acting is o.k. and the plot has some good points.It is an all black movie with the rib house ownergiving lectures on 1968 Black Panther doctrinesand the whitees/ crackers: after a while you get the feeling that the prejudice is two ways?!I kind of like the movie as it is a good current young people's movie.
3,Gift,"I bought this for my coworker who doesn't know how to shop online. I guess he saw it on tv awhile back and really liked it. I can't personally attest to the content of the movie, but the dvd arrived on time and in good shape! Got it pretty cheap too."
3,Good Movie,"I really like this movie a little low budget but its funny, romantic and full of drama.. Whats your favorite part in the movie? My is when the aunt was on her laptop checking out her husband cheating ways on his sim card."
4,Fast read,"I saw the film many years ago, and have now just read the book.Entertaining, and you do find yourself caring for the ex-cons, hoping they don't get caught.Thankfully there is a happy ending, with all turning out right for everyone.Good weekend reading."
4,Books I never got the chance to read in School,"I am slowly trying to work my way through Scott's Collection of orks but it is hard yacker trying to translate his frequent comments in Latin or Greek Mythology after nearly 60 years have passed. Were they better educated in those days or have I forgotten too much of my Schooldays Latin, French and Gaelic. Having been born only 8 miles from Culloden Moor I am finding Waverley and its intrigues most interesting and enlightening. Looking forward to enjoying the rest of his Works.Ritchie M.Christchurch, N.Z."
1,"Terrible sound, worse performance","This has to be the worst cd I've ever heard. Wetton was obviously'under the weather' to say the least and the sound is absolutelypitiful. Lets face it, Wetton hasn't done anything good sincethe Asia ""astra"" album in 1985."
4,Absolutely Gorgeous!!!,"I would pick up any book on Egypt, but one filp through it's pages was all I needed. The photos are wonderful and really all you need to know."
5,I heart soil chemistry.,Item arrived on time and in great condition. Couldn't ask for more.The book is really great an easy to understand. Great Resource book.
3,Good book with problems,"This is a book full of useful primary documents as well as excerpts of diaries, reports and other sources. I found the section on the euthanasia program especially useful in my own research.Unfortunately this book has major problems that make its use by historians problematic. The authors unfortunately did not decide to use footnotes therefore the reader doesn't know where exactly these things come from and if they were simply taken from other secondary sources, as the authors do in a couple sections acknowledge that the section relies heavily on the secondary source of another author.In addition to the lack of footnotes, the book does not have an index. Therefore if one is looking for something on Auschwitz, for example, one would have to flip through the book, and particularly the section on the camps, looking. This is a huge problem, especially in such a large book.The maps in the back of the book are also extremely useful and a great addition to the book."
5,Blades were great!,"I was delighted to find these blades packaged for an individual consumer. Previously, all others who carried this blade, only sold in huge quantities to companies. When my employer recently stopped using the Pacific Handy Cutter (S4 Safety Cutter), and I was no longer able to get blades, I was very upset. This was the best box cutter I had ever used!!!!My thanks for being able to get a box of 100 count blades that were very affordable, and arrived in a timely manner."
2,Not much here,Stick with Butterfield Blues #1 and East/ West...Elvin Bishop had great stuff with Butterfield and took over more guitar and vocals on their third album after Mike Bloomfield left ... but this program list is not really first class....reminds me of a mediocre Commander Cody late release...and the cover looks like it cost $1.27 to design!
4,fantastic package,"Im not sure if I can fill your minimum requirement here with the words,but I will say this is about as good as it gets when it comes to the southern blues/rock style.It has all of Elvin's hits,including his most famous one ""Fooled around and fell in love.""Its well worth the price."
3,average but had some interesting paper information,"I kept thinking this book was going to turn into a sappy romantic novel. It didn't go that far thank goodness. The paper knowledge was interesting and the book made me wonder what an autobiography would be like by this author. My book group didn't have much to say about the book because it wasn't edgy or controversial enough, no one disliked the book."
1,disappointing,It started out so well. How interesting to learn about the history of something we take for granted. But then on page 131 it turned into a romance novel. Our heroine became a ninny and I speed read from there.
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a historical novel about artist J.M.W. Turner. Then as I got into it, I thought there would be a book-within-a-book about Turner. But no. This is a novel about a contemporary journalist. Not so well done. The coup de grace for me was the paragraph where the author puts the Gaza strip at Israel's north border instead of on the south."
5,worth every penny!,"A fabulous resource; my copy has multiple tabbed pages, post-it notes, margin notes!I was privileged enough to meet the author (Shin-Mei Kao) in person at a recent conference, where some of the process drama possibilities were presented in a highly interactive workshop.This book has practical, immediate implications for any age level use, and I'm using some of the ideas for adult education, English-as-a-second/other-language classes.Process drama is something all educators should explore, reflect upon, review, revisit, reflect, and implement in their own way.my opinion)Professional Development study circles would find this an excellent resource as well.Words Into Worlds is a valuable contribution to the education and drama worlds (which is all of our worlds!).Holly"
1,doesn't work,"I purchased this for my wife and simply put, it doesn't work on any of our pots/pans. It doesn't work on the cheap pans, it doesn't work on the mid-range pans, and it doesn't work on the expensinve copper-core stuff.I guess our stuff isn't 'magnetic' - whatever."
3,"1 HP 115 Volt Hayward Pro Series 18"" Above Ground Swimming Pool Sand Filter System # S180T92",Product was delivered within a week with no problems. Has been working very well since I installed it. Does an excellent job and I require very little chlorine compared to my previous DE filter.
3,Careful! Hardboard!,"Bought this to display design portfolio. The finish is nice, semi-gloss. The construction is on the high end, especially the brackets and sleeves. The only problem I have is that the pressed hardboard is just that, pressed hardboard. It has the smell of a Home Depot lumber section [although I love that smell], and looks a little unrefined. On top of that, fingerprints happen constantly, be sure not to touch the cover before handing this to a client or future employer, EVERY LITTLE SMUDGE SHOWS. You can usually clean it up with a little dab of water and a clothe. It's very hard to manage. I might suggest another material/finish--the portfolio itself is great and probably the best out there, just this is very annoying."
5,Rave reviews,"I was very impressed with the cost of the product, the condition and the speed of delivery. Thanks"
1,how NOT to translate the bible !!,"Benny Hinn fans will love it !! Christians who read their bible and understand scripture will hate it. Typical Benny Hinn twisted scripture and bad bible interpretation. For self consumed, greedy, wicked 21st century so called christians who look for signs and wonders, this book is for you. For humble Christ seeking followers of Jesus...this book will make you sick...and to think that Jesus died for people like Benny Hinn and his sickening books....How AWESOME JESUS IS...how pathetic this book is....Follow Jesus or follow Benny Hinn, but you cant follow BOTH, believe in Jesus or believe in Benny Hinn, but you cant believe in both !! AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, WE WILL SERVE THE LORD....AND PRAY FOR BENNY HINNS REPENTANCE AND SALVATION."
1,Great for mosquitos,"1 star for its effectiveness in wiping up the ""blood"" of insects that come way too close to my cat, and it's a good mosquito slammer, as well.The author trades on the ""blood of Christ"" metaphor to line his wallet and fleece others.Bad bad blood!"
2,False advertisement on book edition.,"The book I received was the older edition of book.While the newest edition of book is being advertised. I was very disappointed. Being apart of a bookclub with an different version of book... Sucks! Overall, Benny Hinn is GREAT!"
5,GREAT,This book was awesome! I really love this series and I can't wait for the next book to come out if there is going to be one! There better be!
1,Why is there another one of these books?,"I have read ""Blue is for Nightmares"" and ""White is for Magic"" and after I competed the last book, ""Silver is for Secrets"", I thought it was a great series, but never even thought about there being ANOTHER one... I thought the last one ended well, and never even considered the idea.Sure, it had a sad, tragic ending, but I thought that was the point?You know, the series does get old after a while..."
4,definately should read this...,"i just finished red is for remembrance last night nd i really liked it. at first it was a little confusing with the Stacey and Shell chapters, but it came together at the end. although i guessed who Shell was half way through the book and got it right, it was still a really good book and i would reccomend whoever red blue, white, and silver, should read this one...it reveals the questions you had from silver!"
2,Not so good....,"This series is amazing. The first three books were all page turners. I couldn't put them down until I was finished. However, this book is sadly lacking the caliber the other books in the series possessed. The ending was predictable from the beginning, and the outcome was bittersweet.Some people believe that after Silver is for Secrets, the series should have been over. However, the author didn't really finish the series there. An ending to Stacey Brown's story was required. The attempt to close all the doors left open, though, was unenjoyable. I give the series, overall, a 4 star rating, but this last book is definately not on the same level as the rest."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!,This is an amazing book!!!! I love how Laurie added in Porsha!! I really hope she writes another one. I do miss Drea and Chad but the new characters make up for them. The book is predictable but awesome. I read it all in one day. If you love the other books in the series then you'll love this one!
2,BLAHK!,this book sort of left a bad taste in my mouth. the book was really predictable. i enjoyed the other books in the series but this one was a not that great. the writing wasn't that supreme either. overall...not that great. i think the series should come to an end. the plot of each book is the same. stacey is helping to prevent someone's death. i dont know...it's slacking off a bit on me.
5,"Great book, recommended by native speakers","Great book, going my own pace, it explains things well, there is a lot of pair work though, so get a partner."
4,Good classroom book,"My college teacher uses this book and she is one who expects you to do alot on your own, that being said this isn't the book for self teaching. Its great for classroom instruction with the aid of the workbook, as long as lectures are provided to help put in the missing pieces of japanese grammar that genki misses. Overall, its a good book but only recommended for those in college or high school."
4,Genki Review,"This booke came in great condition, with only one corner bent. It was probably due to packaging, but the book itself is exactly how it was said to be. Would definitely buy from this person again."
5,Decent quality book with great shipping time,The book came in great condition and so far has been very easy to use to learn Japanese!
3,WARNING,"Check to see if your class requires the second edition. I bought this under the impression that it was what I needed, and it turned out that there was a volume 2!"
3,For the most part it is good but its CD has a serious mistake,"I am a native Japanese and using this to teach American people Japanese language via skype.It is generally good, has detailed and excellent explanations on grammar things butone thing I can't even believe is that its CD has a rather serious mistake.They say ''kita (came)"", the past tense of ''kuru(come)"" like ""kita (north)"" in lesson9!"
5,"Helpful, to the point and easy to use","My first-year Japanese college course uses Genki as its textbook, and it has proven to be a very helpful guide. I've had experience with Nakama, which was decent but a bit too disorganized with too much thrown around at once. The Jorden book, simply titled Japanese, is so dated that it is painful and contains no kana in the normal text of the book.Genki gives the user the vocab they are likely to need, along with just enough kanji (which are tied to the vocab in the lesson). Everything is laid out simply yet concisely, and genki is by far the best book I've ever used. It is currently being used by the first year students at Indiana University.What I love the most, other than its organization, is its use of kanji and kana. Virtually every word in Japanese in the book is in kana, with no romaji. Kanji (along with kana subscript) are used frequently. This has helped boost my reading speed greatly."
5,Genki 1: An Integrated Course in Elementary Japanese CD,The CD goes along with the book and gives you different voices on how to say it correctly. Recomend buying it with the book.
2,This book is terribly outdated!!!!,"A 2nd edition of this book has been released and trust me it's 100% better than this version, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!!This original version used a fair amount of very outdated vocabulary, expressions and even some elderly grammar points while skipping over the modern day equivalents COMPLETELY. It also did not fully/ appropriately explain some grammar. The practice section is now more expansive in the 2nd edition with more communication and conversational tasks. The accompanying audio CD is now included with the new textbook instead of sold separately and it's all on a single disk this time. Although not essential, it even has ""Culture Notes"" pages, which are actually extremely helpful for people who are actually planning to put their language skills to use abroad in Japan.PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS OLD VERSION, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE STILL SELLING IT!"
3,Not the best MHC book I've ever read,"This book was definitely the slowest and least consuming MHC book I've read, and I've read a lot. It was too slow, not scary or suspenseful enough, and too easy to predict who the true killer was. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but just weak compared to her others. I recommend reading Loves Music Loves To Dance and Let Me Call You Sweetheart if you like true suspense and a great whodunit."
5,Weep No More My Lady,"Usual excellent MHC, keeps you on edge of your seat throughout the book. Loved the characters. She makes them come alive."
2,Didn't care for it,"As I was reading this book, I was surprised to see profanity. Don't remember that in her other books. Thought she could tell a good story without it. Hate that our culture thinks that is necessary."
5,It Was Great!,"I thought Weep No More, My Lady was so good I couldn't put it down! It was my first time reading a book by MHC and it was the best! MHC should write another book telling what happens to Ted and Elizabeth after the ordeal. I would request this book to anyone that likes to read!"
2,Disappointing,"I figured out who killed Leila somewhere around page 65. MHC can and has done better, like in Remember Me."
2,Not the best,"I listened to the audio version and found it lacking. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that the characters seemed to reach resolution a bit too rapidly. Much of those resolutions left me wondering if the characters suddenly developed ESP...Overall, it was corny and none to realistic. ...Other MHC novels have offered more...this one just felt generic."
5,MHC once again deserves the crown for suspense,"Once again MHC has written a story where anyone can be the bad guy. You begin to question everybody. Elizabeth's famous sister was murdered (or was she?) by her sister's fiance Ted. Elizabeth is the star witness again Ted in the upcoming trial for murder. she receives an invitation from her dear friend for a week of relation at her friend's spa. Unknownly, her friend the Countess, has also invited all the key players to her sister's murder including the fiance, Ted. Elizabeth also meets Alvirah Meehan (The lottery winner) who unknownly helps to find the real killer. Enjoy trying to figure this one out."
3,"So, so","I found this book to be pretty dull, unrealistic, and just overall boring. generally I can get through a MHC book within days, but this one took weeks. Not the best from Clark."
3,"Sharp, Teasing but nothing special","There's a laid-back mood that characterises this book and courtesy Swanson's unique style ,it's quite infectious.Although it was a tad bit exaggerated, I absolutely loved the character of Teddy Deuce.But this book never hit the heights of being ""thoroughly enjoyable"" or absorbing and it was dissapointingly easy to put it down to do something else whenever I felt like it.It also ended a bit abruptly- i'm not quite sure whether or not that was the idea- and that didn't rub off right on me.Ultimately it was better than mediocre but WAY off excellent."
3,Not bad for a first book.. but with holes,"I met the author at a local library in Dallas and gave his book a try.It's a fast-paced book that I finished in one sitting. The characters are somewhat well defined, and the language is good. The book is enjoyable.The big hole in this book is locale. The title, the cover and the cover-notes make a big deal about the story being based in Dallas. In my opinion, as someone living in Dallas, there is nothing in the story that precludes it from being placed in any city, or even any small town. Sure, there are a few Dallas references thrown around, but one doesn't get a feel for the city. The author doesn't linger on anything. No descriptions of places, or of people living in this city. No local issues talked about. Its a book without local flavor.Another peeve.. the chapters are too short."
4,Every Aspiring Model Should See This,"Having been in and around the modeling business for over 40 years, I was delighted to see this film. It really tells it like it is. Kudos to Sara Ziff and the people who helped her make this remarkable film."
2,Duplicates the Website,"I really want to write a good review of this book. Unfortunately, I can't. This book is simply a reprint of the grooming articles from the publisher's website, sharpman.com. The only advantage I can see to getting the book is that you have all the articles in one place, with no need to boot up your computer. That's what saved it from getting only 1 star."
4,The preacher at mid-career,"This ranks as the most straight-ahead biography of Billy Graham published before my ownThe Prince of War: Billy Graham's Crusade for a Wholly Christian Empire. While not nearly as comprehensive as William Martin'sA Prophet with Honor : The Billy Graham Story, this is a more interestingly told tale. Originally published in 1979, it catches Graham near the height of his influence and dynamism. After publication, Graham expressed dismay that he had helped Frady with the project because the author published comments and anecdotes from Graham associates that didn't reflect particularly well on the preacher."
5,Just when you thought you knew it all...,"I have read many articles and books on Billy Graham but this one tops them all. Frady seems to have walked with Billy as he grew up. We get more details about his dating life and his conversion than in any other book. We also get details about his time at Bob Jones college that I had never known about until now. This book is a reprinting of the original that was printed in 1979, I think. It is a great book and very informative. You get the idea that Billy is a person just like you and I. Other biographies tend to put Bro. Graham on a bit of a pedestal. This book reveals him to be a person like anyone else, but a person whom God has chosen to change the world."
1,Terrible,"It was some years ago that I bought this CD. I've waited all this time (since 2007) to be sure before commenting on it. Listening to it a fourth and final time now, in 2011, I'm quite sure that there is something profoundly 'off' about this recording. It might be partially a technical problem (there is a subtle but maddening kind of filtering effect, as if everything is heard through a screen of cotton batting) but mainly I think it is the performance itself that is just bloodless, as if by intelligent and well-meaning androids. How can this happen to such well-known and beloved pieces as the Mozart and Beethoven Piano-Wind Quintets?? And in Berlin of all places?! It's an astonishing kind of obscenity, quite beyond any rational explanation."
4,Death of a Dean,"The Alpine Pursuit is a much better-written book than its predecessor, The Alpine Obituary. Emma Lord is still the editor of the local paper in the the small Washington town of Alpine. Under duress, she attends a local drama production by her unpleasant neighbor, Destiny Parsons. During the production, a shooting scene becomes reality and one of the actors, the Dean of Students at the local community college, is killed when the ""blanks"" in the stage-prop gun prove to be real. Emma has a hard time leaving the investigation in the hands of Milo, town sheriff and Emma's on-again off-again boyfriend. She does her own sleuthing and finds that many people disliked the murdered Dean and had a motive for killing him. Recurring themes of dogs and drugs eventually lead Emma to the identity of the killer. This is a good entry in the Emma Lord Mystery Series."
5,Loved it!!,"Love Mary Daheim.....have read most of these alpine books and loved her other series especially the books with Renie , judiths cousin.....the bed and breakfast series...waiting on new books. Mary is an outstanding writer and will continue reading her books."
3,"good material, poor organization",This book switches back and forth between model organisms too much; it would be better if there were a chapter on each of the 4 major model organisms and subsections about each stage of development.
5,Good book,"Very well written. Its actually interesting to read!I am a bio major and i have to read a lot of these type of textbooks, this one is surely among the least boring and most to the point"
5,Great book.,I recommend this book for those who are seeking an easy yet deep understanding of the developmental biology. The author is a good writer.
2,dreadful to read,I'm using this book for a development class at UC Irvine and it is truly dreadful to read. I'm a straight A student and I'm really struggling to find any meaning in this book. The information is all there but it's jumbled up and seemingly contradictory to the point that it's almost useless. I gave up reading the book... I'm just using the lecture slides. Don't waste your money... the book won't help you for your class.
1,HORRIBLE TEXTBOOK!!!,"I used this book for my development class, and honestly, it was one of the WORST biology books I have ever used, if not the worst. The textbook is incredibly boring and it does not explain any topics well at all. If you have to use this book for a course, I suggest that you get some type of study guide that will help you in this subject because this book will not help you. If I could give this book 0 stars, I would. Horribly written!"
1,"""New release"" NOT ""New content""","Buyers beware! I got this DVD because I thought it would contain some new and exciting episodes of Bob the Builder. As it turned out, it only has old episodes - Muck Gets Stuck - Lofty to the Rescue plus the one where Bob fixes Farmer Pickles hay bale shed and the one where Pilchard gets stuck in a tree after a storm. I wrote to Hit Entertainment about the DVD, and told them I thought they were intentionally misleading consumers. They pointed out that the wording on the DVD says a ""new release"" NOT ""new content."" But no where on the DVD is it clearly written that these are old episodes - no mention of classics, children's favourites. They don't even have the names of the episodes on the DVD cover. If you are looking for a new DVD, this isn't for you. If you don't have the episodes mentioned above, then it's not a problem."
1,Nothing new here,I unfortunately didn't see the other Amazon review before buying this DVD. My son was so disappointed - it has no new episodes.
5,good memories,"I heard this on a radio MANY years ago and immediately bought it on an LP, which, much later, was destroyed in a flood. I'm so happy to be able to hear this again."
4,book review,"this book was very interesting with a good plot with lots of twists and turns,it will keep you quesing until the last page"
5,i remember this,goosebumps never scared me my fave from the series is something fishy and chicken chicken the one i never understood was the one where the kid slept in the spare bedroom (the one after chicken chicken)
4,Estevan Alvarez review,"The book I read is Goosebumps the series of ""Say Cheese and Die"" It is written by R.L Stine. It is really mysterious because is of some kids who go to a haunted house and they take a camera that doesn't belong to them which is really different than any other camera.I really like this book because it made me feel like if I was actually in the story, since I was really interested to now what was going to happen next .It is one of the best books I've ever read because it was just so interesting.I recommend you read this book because the adventures of the two kids in the book were really entertaining for me, and if they were entertaining for me than maybe they will be for you as well."
3,Say Cheese And Die,"The main characters incude:Michel Warner,Greg Banks,Doug Arthers,Shari Walker. The setting is in Pitts Landing.Some of the main events are that they found a very old house.I liked this book because it is exciting to read.I think anyone who likes exciting books should buy and\or read this book."
2,Say Cheese and Die,"This book was very interesting. I enjoyed it a lot because it was very addicting. When the story develops, it gets very exciting. It is for younger readers, 5th grade and younger probably. I liked this book, but I felt it was too easy. It is the best Goosebumps book I've read by far. A girl vanished and magically reappeared out of nowhere. Greg takes a picture of his dads' brand new car and when the picture develops the car is shown totaled. If you read other Goosebumps books, you would like this book.Tom"
4,Kylea's Big Reveiw,"Dear Reader,My book is called Say Cheese and Die. It's a really great book. I like the mystery and the exitement in the story. It's about an evil camera and when it takes a picture they come out wrong. I really enjoyed it. If you need a good book read this book.Your pal,Book Worm"
3,Review Veronica Guerin,"A fact-filled ""documentary"" about Dublins recent past...concerning a Journalistand her impact on drugs and drug-dealing and organised crime in Ireland. Played with quality by Cate Blanchette (I love her) ...but seemed lacking in some of the qualities that make a good movie.......more background into the other characters, maybe more of an embelishment all around, in all aspects."
3,When The Sky falls was better,"True-life exploitation movie masquerading as a serious cinematic investigation into the life and death of Dublin journalist Guerin, Cate Blanchett, who was murdered in 1996 by the very drug pushers she was attempting to expose. In his attempt to sex-up the not entirely palatable facts of the life of a professional crusader, Joel Schumacher has overplayed the theatrics and turned what might have made a devastating movie la Silkwood into a hysterical TV movie-of-the-week.Blanchett is all scowl and cheekbones and, given the lack of background to her character, she does the best she can. Crudely scripted with jarring, in-your-face, shock-tactic visuals punctuated by a lamentably sentimental Irish music soundtrack, the film walks an unsteady line between outraged worthiness and Gotcha! sensationalism which doesn't even begin to explain why Guerin would risk not just herself but her family for her obsession."
4,a modern martyr to the drug problem in Ireland,"Drugs and thugs plague modern Irish cities and endanger children.A crime fighting reporter goes after finding the big manhidden behind the scenes and when she finds him, he beats herup threatens her and then tries to buy her off.They make her life a hard place,yet she keeps at it. Her driving record of parking and speeding ticketsin the end puts her in the known place at the known time.In the US the media is controlled by a few, so that people like herare not heard even if they want to be?That the Irish press is free and the US press isn't becomes plain,because we aren't allowed such martyrs that are found in Mexico and Ireland?"
5,An Important Film,"A very important film for Ireland. Cate Blanchett's acting is impeccable, her accent near perfect. The film is very accurate yet very entertaining. Go and see it."
5,This movie will change your life.,"An old horse trainer once told me ""The hardest thing is to find out what the right thing is, but when you find out what that right thing is, the hardest thing is not to do it."" This is a moving portrayal center-pinned around a headstrong Irish female journalist who refused to back down from her mission of exposing Ireland's corrupt drug underground in the mid 1990's. A pleasing departure from stereotyped casting - setting is well done and character treatment is deeply explored! The characters in Veronica Guerin are complex and ring truer to life than one might expect. Veronica Guerin is nobly portrayed. Highly recommended."
4,interesting,"This was a movie about an Irish reporter who decides she wants to investigate the drug world after she sees young children in a local apartment building playing with dirty heroin needles. She sets out to get to the source of the problem, but as she gets closer and closer, her life and the lives of those around her become filled with danger. This film was based on a true story, so it was a great one to tell, however I did not feel sympathy for her. When the drug lords began to make death threats to her husband and children, instead of backing off, she pushed harder. I think that was selfish of her. Great movie, I just did not agree with it."
5,Veronica Guerin DVD,"Good service and I received it in good time. It's a beautiful movie with a beautiful sound track, about a very tragic factual event, not to mention the superb performance by Cate Blanchett.I don't know if it was the movie or the soundtrack, most likely it was a combination of the two,but I'm not ashamed to say that I had tears in my eyes during The Murder, Bad News and The Funeral scenes. ""No movie and it's soundtrack"" has ever did this to me before.Do you have Veronica Guern on Blue-Ray?"
3,Shumacher's done worse,"Guerin has good acting, but it is a little too slow. The story is interesting, but drags on. I had to put on subtitles because I didnt understand the Irish accent."
2,"Great content, poor workmanship",Excellent content however I agree with the previous review that this book is not quite up to publishers standards. I bought from amazon not a third party but the binding is already falling apart (one week old) and the pages look like it was printed on computer paper not standard text book paper. Otherwise could be great but not worth $178 if it is going to fall apart.
4,Excellent illustrations,Excellent illustrations for the topics which are coveredBut does not include some of the vital topics like vascular
3,Organizational Behavior,I am currently using this text in a class for organizational behavior. The text is well written and has symmetry in its topics. I do believe that the average reader will find some of the references in the book long and redundant. The use of many technical terms and inference are very common in this book.
1,Terrible book.,"This is not a good book. This was assigned to me for a business school class. I'm one of those people that really get into the subject matter and into learning. But, if you are going to buy this for self-improvement, try something else.Here is why:1. The writing is boring. It's extremely hard to get through each chapter.2. The sections that make up each chapter don't seem to relate to each other. They don't seem to make sense. At least to me."
5,Beautiful!,I love this wallet. The color is perfect. I receive compliments about the wallet everywhere I go. It is well worth it!
4,1857 Version,"If you don't think Verdi was a genius, skip this review. If you adore Verdi as I do, you should hear his original version of ""Simon Boccanegra"". Verdi's 1881 Version of this opera is a masterpiece, but it took a lot of careful revision of the 1857 version to get there. If I had never heard the 1881 version before hearing the 1857 version, I would have never believed such a transformation possible. From the ottocento world of cabalettas and cadenzas to the threshold of ""Otello"" is an amazing achievement. This recording features competent singing and good sound AND MOST IMPORTANTLY a full libretto of the 1857 version. Recommended to those interested in a full study of Verdi, not to casual opera lovers."
4,Bought this for my 6 month old,My 6 month old can grab tags or cloth better so I decided to buy this for her to practice grabbing. She shows enough interest in it and can shake it for awhile. She likes to taste it too =] Sometimes I put her hand through the hole so that she can wear it as a bracelet and rattle it around -- that seems to work too!
2,Very small...,"I was surprised at how small these pillow shams were, I dont think I'll be keeping them. A normal pillow would have to be stuffed inside of them, they look miniature."
1,misunderstood description,"Misunderstood the term ""boudoir sham"" and thought it was a regular pillow sham. Had to return for size. Thought item should have been more clearly described as meant for a small, decorative pillow and not a traditional pillow sham. Forced to spend shipping to get and return. Probably nothing wrong with item except confusing description."
1,"Ew, horrrrrrible fabric.","Apparently didn't read the description closely enough. 50% cotton, 50% POLYPROPYLENE, which is what cheap rugs are made of. Ugh. Figured no big deal, they go on the back of the bed, I'm not going to be sleeping on them, it doesn't matter. But alas, not only are they unpleasantly slick and petroleum-based-synthetic feeling, but after a week or two they start to PILL. BIG TIME. So now they feel gross *and* they look all manky. Booooo. Will order 100% cotton ones as soon as I can locate some in the correct size and pattern.Oh, also? They cheaped out on the insert/opening design on these -- there's no closure, the opening is all the way at one end, and the fabric at the opening overlaps like MAYBE half an inch. Which means your pillows are going to constantly try to come out, and there'll always be a big unattractive gap, so the side with the opening ALWAYS has to face down."
2,bedsread color,"Pattern was as expected. texture is perfect .color was not a slate blue ,it was light blue.keeping it anyway,dont have time to return."
5,Pinzon Diamond Matelasse,"This Euro Sham is wonderful. The fabric is soft and luxurious. I loved it so much, I ordered a third one and told friends as well. Thanks!"
4,Nice quality and exaclty what I was looking for,"These were exactly what I was looking for. They match my bedding and headboard like I wanted. I have washed them a couple times and they have not faded. I only have 2 complaints, the first is that when I put the euro pillow inside that it gapes open in the back. I have it pinned shut right now, but I will be putting some velcro to keep them shut and to make it easy to get the pillows out when needed. My second complaint would be that the fringe around kind of flops down when they are propped up. I wish they were more stiff so that it would look more clean. I have huge pillows in them so it's not a problem of them being under stuffed. Otherwise I love the look and feel of them. The price was great too. They are a nice deep brown also."
2,Dry clean recommended,"I bought this with what I thought was a matching bed skirt. Turns out although the pattern is the same, the manufacturer is the same, and the name of the fabric is the same, the care instructions are not. The bedskirt is washable, the sham is not. The sham is an impractical purchase for me, as I will not have it dry cleaned. My fault, I guess for not checking more closely ....I guess I'll wash it when it's soiled and see what happens. Would not buy another one."
5,Great,I bought the set and used these for a clients guest room. Looks great at a great price too. Thank you
3,Combo pack leaves a little to be desired,"I am not a fan of the combination packaging of any products, generally-speaking. I like two out of the three kinds of bars pretty well, and the third only so-so."
4,Enjoyed,"These bars a kind of chewy and crunchy at the same time. They definitely retain the taste of the original cereal, but I'm not sure what the ""milk"" in the center truly is. I enjoyed these and will probably buy more."
3,Quick Breakfast,Breakfast bars are good for someone on the go or for who ever forgets to eat a regular breakfast sitting down. I did not care for the bars of Cocoa Puffs or the Cinnamon Toast Crunch but the Honey Nut Cheerios were great!!
1,Not my taste at all.,I thought this would be a good variety for the normal granola bar in the morning. They are way too sweet and what is with the fake milk strip through the center of the bar? I like all the cereals (as cereal) but these bars have a lot to be desired! :( Very disappointed.
1,I thought these were GROSS,"I have four kids ranging from 2-10 yrs old. Nobody wanted any of these bars. Only the ten-yr old would eat the cocoa ones occasionally. They were all pretty gross tasting. I'm not sure who would find these appealing. I tried to keep them in the car or with me at soccer games but even when they were hungry, they didnt want to eat them. These are junk food."
4,He writes in color,"Faulkner writes in rainbow color. Full of feeling, mortification, and injustice. The character of Joe Christmas is a shockingly tragic figure that seems almost Christlike, and the character of the oversexed Miss Burden is equally sad. There are so many themes you could pull out of this story. It just fascinates me. I think it touches on race relations in a way that's really pretty intuitive for the time period and part of the country Faulkner was coming from. He plays with both fear of black people and fear of female sexuality, all in the same weave. Worth it."
4,Light in August,"The book Light In August by William Faulkner was definitely a challenge. This was the first Faulkner novel I had read. I became intrigued with his work after reading the short story, A Rose for Emily. LIA's central focus was the plight of Joe Christmas, a half black/ half white man who is not accepted by either world and a young girl's search for the father of her unborn child. Although slow at times, the different twists and plots within plots make it an interesting read! I'm ready to read more Faulkner!"
3,Light in August audio cassette,"Be aware that you need a ""book cassette adaptor"" in order to listen to the tapes on a walkman."
1,Nobody to like in this one.,"Since I had never read Faulkner, I thought I'd give him a try. None of the characters in this book had any redeeming value. They were all awful people. I kept reading hoping against hope for some improvement, or at least the violent death of these poor sufferingspecimens of humanity. I was disappointed on both counts."
1,Not so great,I had another basic FM transmitter and it worked fine in my area. I get lot of static and I feel frustrated. I won't advise for my friends.
3,worth checking out,"pretty solid release considering both mc's are only 17 or 18. low-end production didn't help much either, but there are a couple of tracks that hit pretty hard. pretty much the same themes over and over: money, fame, power, etc., but a lot of the rhymes are surprisingly clever. also, track four is an entire dis on Eminem that, obviously an attempt to get mainstream attention, actually is pretty funny.if you can get this CD used or new for a good price then I recommend it. it's not the greatest, but it's certainly far from the worst."
1,Wish I had read reviews first.,"I would have to definately agree with the first review of this book. This was the biggest waste of money I have spent in a long time. Story was so far fetched, so poorly told. The idea of the book was very interesting to me but the writing was just not there. Please, look for another book."
4,Good Buy For the Price,"I got a great price for this product, as it was a ""premier"" jersey rather than simply a replica. The price made me slightly hesitant to begin with, and so I wasn't surprised that when I inspected it that there was a small yellow stain on the back letters. Fortunately it was easily removed with a tide-to-go pen. Overall, I'm really happy with the purchase and I can't wait to give the jersey to my boyfriend for Christmas!!"
1,Nas said Hip hop is dead.....it is:(,"I heard one song which someone said was the best, My 64. I listened and thought why is everything dying slowly in this world. Jay Z and Nas cant even get back to their thrones and they now leave hip hop to these talkers with no heart, no soul. The big names have made their money and have nothing left to prove. now anybody can get in this game with no skill, I feel like quitting my day job and getting in the Flip Flop game. Mike Jones has no structure, no flow, jus a bunch of talk about the same things. this is horrific!! We can hold on to this if we want."
3,WHO IS MIKE JONES?,"He made his name with his first dope cd complete with plenty of instant classics! This cd had 6 tracks, good tracks, but 6! Other rappers like Birdman or Game have at least 18 or so tracks and Mike Jones comes out with a cd called the American Dream with 6 tracks. The American Dream is a cd with at 16 tracks for under $10! My 64 is the best track but you'd be better off downloading it, legally. and oh yeah, WESTSSSIDE!"
1,can he make somehting new,this album shouldent even be a album. there are two tracks that were on his last one and one track with the same beat as a eazy song. Also all of the songs are the same mike jones. Hip-Hop is officially dead
3,bo,"nice biography but i was led to believe this would spend more time on hisactual radio ( and tv) programs and the characters that he developed andused on the shows.there was actually very little on that.was looking for more of a ""behind the scenes"" book"
2,A sleepy biography of Fred Allen,"I'm a big Fred Allen fan, I played his shows on my radio show. This biography goes into great detail on his early life, his years of struggles in vaudeville, honing his writing skills. I could not finish it, there is way too much mundane detail. The writing style is very dry, no zip or zazz. The biography of Queen Victoria was racy in comparison. IT would be much better to buy a CD or MP3 of his shows."
3,Michaen Biehn Showcase,"For Michael Biehn fans (Terminator, Navy Seals, The Rock) this is a terrific showcase for his physical action/emotionally wounded style. It's a typical detective/buddy flick, with an interesting juxtaposition of Chinese and Italian mobsters. Michael's in top form, and is great fun to watch."
4,really cool action movie,Double edge aka as american dragons is a really powerfull action movie. I think this is one of biehn's best.But I think many scenes are much exaggerated.
4,Well acted for what it is,"Agree with others that much/most of the dialog is bad, and the plot is thin--at best--but Biehn and Park deliver, given what they have to work with. Some of the best scenes are the silent, emotive ones. This is actually one of my favorite Biehn movies--up there with Terminator, although T is hands down a much better story."
3,Decent book for metagame,"This is a good book to solidify your poker book collection.Don't expect epiphanies, but, this can help you with your overall approach and reactions to poker."
4,"Pins and needles, needles and pins . . .","Anyone who has read books on the martial arts, the psychology of playing the stock market, ""real"" Zen Buddhism, or almost any self-improvement book will find much familiar territory here. Just because the advice is given a lot does not mean that the advice is bad. Stay in the ""now,"" concentrate, play your own game. Good advice.Phillips has produced an easy read that covers topics like taking the long view, the importance of calmness, staying detached, getting into the rhythm of the game, not hesitating, respecting your opponents, and understanding why you are in the game in the first place. He peppers the chapters with quotes from Zen masters, athletes, and gamblers.Reading parts of this book can be especially valuable when you're in the middle of one of those seemingly interminable runs of bad cards. Remember . . . a happy man is a man who grins."
4,A different perspective,"This book isn't a technical manual of how to play poker. It doesn't describe when to call, bet, raise or bluff.This book (rightly) points out that winning at poker requires an inner discipline. It then uses the Zen philosophy to encourage the readers to develop that necessary discipline. Knowing when to call, bet, raise, and bluff, are necessary to win at poker, but these skills aren't sufficient.If you're the type of player that knows the odds, and most of the mechanics of poker, but you still can't win [this is especially true for low limit players], then this book could greatly help your game."
2,Waste of Time,"This book is helpful if you really have trouble managing your emotions at the poker table. It's more of a ""chicken soup..."" type book than a book that can lead to improved poker play, that is, unless you're having trouble with the emotions of the game. It's not even an enjoyable read. Read ""Zen and the Martial Arts"" by Joe Hyams if you're looking for a good zen book, and basically any other poker book if you're looking to master poker concepts."
3,Good for any poker player,"This book focuses on one of the hardest (if not the all time hardest) things to learn at the poker table-- keeping your cool and staying in control of yourself, it brings up lots of very interesting points and reads like a story-book, I enjoyed reading it very much, a great book for any poker player."
3,Many strong ideas marred by a few incorrect concepts,This book sets out to achieve a clear and reasonable goal of applying Zen to help your poker game. It describes the limitations in doing this in a clear and reasonable manner.Many of the concepts set out by the book are very useful. What really marrs the book is the occasionally mention of ways of detecting and leaving a cold table early and like issues. That part of the book is just incorrect.I'd suggest this book for anybody (isn't that all of us) that occasionally or not so occasionally has troubles with emotions coming inbetween plan and execution. Read each section critically and I believe the sum output is well worth the cost.
5,4.5 stars,"It's understandable that most people concentrate on Gordon's Blue Note albums of the first half of the 60's, but the couple of perfectly fine albums he recorded in the mid-50's tend to get completely overlooked. That's a shame, because they represent an interesting interlude in his career, midway between the youthful rambunctiousness of his Savoy sides and the maturity of his Blue Notes. This album, for instance, alternates uptempo swingers with masterful ballads (thus the title). There's a straightforward quality to it that makes the Blue Note material seem to have a sour undertow in comparison. While that may be part of what gives the Blue Notes their complexity, like the proverbial fine wine, it's nice to occasionally have a shot of neat whiskey. The album Daddy Plays the Horn, from this same period, is equally good."
2,Out of date with poor piano arrangements,"This book primarily contains piano/vocal arrangements of sacred music from the Gospel/Folk era from 1970-1979, along with at most a dozen or so ""chestnuts"" from earlier eras. The work of Jack Schrader, the widely respected composer and arranger whose name appears as one of the authors, is visibly present in but a handful of the pieces, and even there his piano arrangements are not of the same caliber as those he has written for his choral anthems.Vocally, the arrangements on the whole lack soloistic touches. Few are through composed, there is an absence of interludes and bridges where the soloist might take a few breaths, no modulations, few alternative forms of the melody at the end of each work.Finally, the piano writing in the accompaniments is variable, at best. Some works have minimal accompaniment that follows the melody. Others, while sufficient, are unimaginative. A handful are useful as written."
3,fear of sin,Gregory uses these 'comfort' passages in the Gospel to turn his congregation towards the works of compunction and repentance
2,Very dissapointed,"I don't like flowery parfums, and was hoping for for something classic and timeless. Immediately I was shocked by very strong, unpleasant chemical vapor. I must say it gets better in about an hour, but the first impression right after applying ruins it for me."
1,Really stinky stuff.,"Okay, for the price I took a chance. The smell is quite vile and seems to be perfumed with chemicals rather than essential oils. I was seduced by the description of the fragrance notes: citrus, leather, and tobacco. I would highly recommend spending the extra money and puchasing Habanita as it definitely has notes of leather and tobacco and a nice soft finish that lasts. This reminds me of the perfume I used to buy in Jr. High because it was cheap and loud. I'm sorry to those who do like it but if you are buying sight unsmelled, I would definitely go another direction."
1,Tepid,I purchased this album from a used music store in Santa Fe. Mr. Hanley's lyrics are whiney and his vocals are grating. The CD does not appear to be professionally produced. I recommend trying to download the songs from your favorite P2P program.
1,Very poor quality,"I must have received a bad batch of disks. If you were to look at the sides on the spindle of disks there is a bunch of warping. As far as a being able to record on them only 1 out of every 5 so far have worked, then when I try to play back the disks they skip. Very unhappy with this product. I had to buy more disks as these have been utterly useless to me."
5,A MILLION STARS!,"Finally, the Lords have released a album that lives up to and SURPASSES Lust. If you were able to get the copy of Pragamatic with the bonus cd you had a preview to this cd. GO GET THIS CD!"
2,"Well, they kinda went downhill...","Man, I still love Voodoo-U and Our Little Secret, but this album is just terrible. It's boring, repetitive, and unoriginal. Maybe the LOA just got burnt on the same old stuff but thought they would lose their audience if they changed at all. At least their previous albums were fun to listen to and were useful for driving away all prudish people in the general area. I've listened to this album five times and it'll probably never see a CD player's laser again."
2,"Didn't like at first, now one of my favorites!","Ignore the 2 star rating, this is a 4-star album bare minimum. I had written this review a long, lone time ago (years) and I really didn't like this at first, but it grew on me. It's now one of my favorite albums by the Lords!"
4,Decent,"Heaven is an Orgasm is the Lords most recent offering. Originally a limited printing offering, they were nice enough to re-release it to the public. While not near the genius of Lust, this album is good Lords of Acid music. If you like the Lords, get this CD, if you don't know them, start with Lust and then you will be hooked."
3,GET IT STRAIGHT.,"First of all, for all of you other 'persons', this is not a real albulm, this is a collection of unreleased material; which is the reason why the albulm sounds incomplete and B rated....and the vocalist (except for 'Robot Love') is Jade 4U. They should have left some kind of inner notes eplaining that, then maybe more fans would have appreciate it, but I guess only the REAL LOA fans would know....I say I like 90% of it, the other 10% I do not care for (Orchrestral Sensations, Feel So Alive). What do you guys expect from a release of outtakes???"
2,I'm glad you guys liked it but....,I threw this CD in the trash the night I bought it. It's just plain goofy.
2,"Nice watch, until the battery dies","This watch worked very well for over a year. The battery died. I have found it to be impossible to remove the back cover without ruining the finish on the watch and face. The small tab on the back cover that is intended as a location to pry the back up is too small for anything but a very sharp tool. The amount of force necessary to pry up the back cover creates a very dangerous situation when the small sharp tool being used (screwdriver, knife, etc.) slips."
1,Watch with no melody,I was disappointed with my purchase. The watch does not play a melody when you push the button. A waste of my money it would cost more to return than it was worth.
2,Seen them before...,"I'm in complete agreement with the previous reviewer. As stated, a number of these photos have been seen before, so anyone with any Civil War interest may be truly disappointed. I had the opportunity to see the presentation of these photos at the Medford historical society when the book first came out, & found the same to be true there - I'd already seen picture after picture, & when I asked the staff there why these previously published, commonly seen photos were in their showing, as new finds in their attic, their only response was complete confusion - whether that was because they didn't know themselves (though how a historical society couldn't is beyond me), or they were surprised that I knew, I have no idea. Anyway, though the photos are certainly interesting, I would save your $$ if you're looking for a collection with a lot of new photos/information..."
5,"Inspiring, Insightful Guide To The Great Beyond","In this book, Bruce Moen explores further in the non-physical realms, covering territory pioneered by Robert Monroe, who mentored Bruce's quest into spiritual realms. This book uses much of the lingo created by Monroe and incorporated into Moen's previous books, so it is helpful if you have read other books by these authors. In this book, the author describes fascinating experiences and goes further into the nature of how consciousness is projected into physical reality. It explores how our beliefs produce our realities in out-of-body realms, and how our lives and experiences may be integrated into a higher level of self, all the way up to the Source, which Moen describes as ""Curiosity's Father."" This is a wonderful book to read if you are interested in exploring the nature of life and spiritual development."
3,"Hawks, Eagles and Falcons of North America: Biology and Natu",I was a little disappointed when I received the book. I found several inaccuracies in the text and many of the photos appear to be of captive or mounted birds.
2,"More ""dumbing down"" of America","The author asserts that EQ is the critical competency for success even in highly technical fields such as medicine and engineering. Yes individualism and ability are passe and what really matters is how well you can schmooze and get along with the team. How often have we seen this demonstrated as those with less ability are promoted through the ranks because they are excellent politicians. Well according to Goleman, those were the correct placement decisions."
1,"All anecdotes, very little advice","Like many reviewers before me, I bought this book thinking that it will suggest ways one can go about improving one's emotional intelligence. However, what I ended up getting is endless anecdotes.Goleman spends the entire book, listing anecdotes after anecdotes, explaining ""why"" emotional intelligence is important, but not ""how"" to become more emotionally intelligent.I do not need to know ""why"" EI is important; I bought the book, I know it is important."
2,Long on Anecdotes--But Short on Advice,"I began this book with great interest. With his excellent anecdotes, I quickly became fully convinced of the value of working with emotional intelligence. But instead of going on to make suggestions as to how a person could improve their own emotional inteligence, or how to help employees/managers in this area, he continued on and on with more anecdotes, clear until the end of the book. I didn't need any more convincing--I was already convinced by the first third of his book--I wanted him to give some advice about implementation, which he didn't give."
1,more pablum for workplace freeloaders and diversity trainers,"Long live mindless, emotional, public and private bureaucracy!!!More biased, feel-good anti-individual propaganda. Exemplifying one of the many prevalent though intrinsically worthless concepts in the politically correct government mandated and controlled, redistributionist, collectivist workplace and economy of today. Remember ""quality circles?"""
3,Basic Workplace Application of Goleman's Concepts,"I use this book in a graduate class that I teach. It's a quick, light read. For those who view this book as somewhat repetitive and limiting, I would agree. Those interested in lots of stories where the concepts are applied will love it. Those who want the real meat - where the fundamentals of the value of EI are demonstrated and the real research presented - will have to supplement it with other of Goleman's works."
4,Interesting - Thought provoking,"Being a student of author Dr. Jeff McNair works, this ranks right up with his writings. Daniel captures articulately the essence of emotional intelligence in a workable fashion. I would say it is a must read for anyone who is in business of human resourses.Very well done"
5,"A ""Must-read"" for Every Corporate Employee","This book is a ""must-read"" for every corporate employee. Colleges should seriously consider having a senior-year course based on this book, because it summarizes all the skills necessary for success in the corporate workplace. If you have already graduated and are already in a corporate job, then do yourself a favor and READ THIS BOOK."
2,"More of ""why"" and not ""how"".","I agree with Daniel in most of what he said, however the title is a bit misleading. The word ""Working"" seems to be the operative, but I didn't see many examples of ""how"" to work, but ""why"" it is important to have emotional intelligence.If you are looking for answers on how to modify your behavior to enhance your relationships, or working better with people, then you might have to look elsewhere.In reading the book I felt like Mr. Goleman was trying to fill the pages rather than give concise content. This book would have been better at 1/4 the size."
1,Disappointed,"I was expecting I would get information on IMPROVING my EQ. However the book only tells how EQ is important in working place but never provide methods on HOW TO IMPROVE it. Truely, the examples or stories of the importance of EQ are great, but I didn't benefit from anything.. as I ALREADY KNEW IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE EQ AT WORK! that's why I am looking for information about EQ.."
1,Unfortunately not useful,We all know E-IQ is important and do NOT need a book of endless examples to illustrate this. I was looking for practical advice.And the title is clearly misleading. How do you work with E-IQ? This is not mentioned.
2,Ever higher unrealistic standards written here,"This books simple lists and extols all the virtues of 'Emotional Intelligence' without telling one how to go about obtaining this. It's like telling everyone all the virtues of being thin and all the negative things about being obese WITHOUT telling you how to go about losing weight.This type of book is written to raise the higher unrealistic standards/expectations for employees. Replace the word ""Emotional Intelligence"" with ""Maturity"" and you'll be better off in life."
2,Disappointed,"Good information but does not execute how to utilize the information it leaves you confused and aggravated. I kept waiting for the punch line, guess the jokes on me."
2,Not written with Emotional Intelligence,"The author of this book was obviously not applying ""emotional intelligence"" principles when writing this book. The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner. I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible. It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing? Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes."
1,Another depressing addition to psych-lite for managers,"Although the art of management remains to some extent a mystery, and managers thus eager for true insights into the underlying framework for personal relations, there is still really no excuse for such simplistic platitudes."
2,Working with Emotional Intelligence,I would give this book no more than 3 stars. The Reader puts you to sleep. The reason I only gave it 2 stars is because Disc 9 belongs to a totally different book. Chapers 40 to 40 something being read by a british woman. I did not get the entire book. Be rest assured I will be returning the item for a full refund or a complete book. Thank you.
3,Looooooooong and repetitious,"I read and read and read and read and, well you got the point. I think is too much of the same. It is very strong the first half, but the other half took discipline to finish."
2,Common sense stuff,"I have been to many seminars and read a couple of books dealing with this topic. There are many helpful, albeit obvious, tips on working with difficult people, working in difficult situations, and working with teams. I wouldn't say I didn't like the book, but I wasn't really wowed by it either.Ironically, a manager recommended this to me (which I found very insulting). After I read it I realized that she needed to read it most of all!"
2,Tedious,"If you want to read about emotional intelligence, then get the original book for the same author ""Emotional Intelligence"". If you want to read about practical applications of emotional intelligence in the work place then this is what this book is about. I only gave it two stars because I think that the whole book should be summarised into 20-30 pages and just added as a chapter to the original work. Its important to read about the applications of emotional intelligence, but in this book you end up reading the same story over and over again with different companies and different people."
4,Worthwhile purchase,"A good anime but way too short. Just watching it once makes you crave more to the point its painful, so be warned. Also the dub in itself isn't too bad except Elara's voice really irritated me and her name was pronounced as ""Erala"" which makes no sense whatsoever really......"
5,Great item!!,"Not only is the DVD an absolutely great anime to watch (sadly, it's not any longer than this one), but it also holds a great story with funny characters and a great twist to what could be considered a typical situation.Much recommended to all!(and amazon provided swift shipping =))"
4,twin signal,"not the greatest anime ever made. but, definatly one of the funniest! you even like the bad guys. don't expect a great plot, but if your after a fun/action adventure, where you root for everybody, than this is it. i recommend this for for the whole family!"
3,book,"it has served its purpose, it could be a bit more in detail and precise but as far a now its ok"
1,Don't bother if you have a mac,"I bought this about 6 months ago expecting a stand alone synth program and was very disappointed. This is only a plug in for a DAW (even though it says this no where on their website). After flailing around on the internet I managed to find a free player and was happy for a while. I recently got my new mac and found out that even though this claims mac compatibility it cannot be installed on OSx Lion. The cakewalk boards are full of people asking cakewalk for help and the silence from is deafening.If you have a PC and are using a compatible DAW, go for it. The Sounds are great. If you are using a mac or you don' tknwo what a DAW is, avoid this like the plague!"
3,"Expected more quality, bad looping samples","Its packed with lots of sounds in all categories.I myself would like more woodwind to choose from.Overall its an ok program with all kind of orchestral sound (+ synths)But what I found very bad was the looping of the samples!You can clearly hear a sample being looped when holding the note.. sounded just like the sample was looping in 1993 with Soundtrakcer on an Amiga.I excpect much more quality from this VST instrument than this.SO now again, I am searching after a better orchestral VST packacge for my Cubase."
5,Awesome Multiple Viewpoints,"Ivy has been taunted ruthlessly by three popular girls since fourth grade. When the Government class teacher holds a mock trial to teach about our court system and a suit is filed against the bullies, it seems Ivy might finally be left alone.This outstanding book by author Amy Goldman Koss takes an unflinching look at peer pressure and the fear that drives/propels it. Told in eight believable and memorable points of view, readers glimpse the individual motives and how they all play into the end result.-- Reviewed by Michelle Delisle"
3,It's alright,"Poison Ivy is a decent book. Not great, not bad. Just decent. There were a total of eight narrators; a few too many for my liking. While it was interesting and entertaining to see things from so many different perspectives, many of the narrators didn't add much to the story. They just provided a different way to give information. Some of the characters were kind of stereotyped: there was the mean girl with the two sidekicks, the quiet, smart girl, and the overeager teacher; while some were original: the wannabe lawyer and the goodhearted guy who actually has trouble making up his mind. The book also could've benefited from being longer; it was very short, and the ending, while unexpected, felt like it needed just a little something more. Poison Ivy is one of those books that you should read if you're interested, but otherwise, you don't need to seek it out."
2,Junk,Unit takes terrible pictures. Shutter speed is horrible. Battery life worse than the shutter speed. Don't waste your money.
2,no good,"This is ""just"" a good binocular. The pictures are horribles. I tried to use like a camera but don`t work. All pictures are vibrate."
2,Not what I was looking for,"What I was looking for on this product was to be able to look through the binoculars and take the picture of what I was watching, maybe that's not even possible I don't now. In my mind description is misleading.If what you're looking for is a camara bundled with binoculars this is it. maybe helpful If you want to snuggle a camera into a concert or something, I can't think about something else somebody would use a product like this.If what you're looking for is very close pictures from what you get from a binoculars optics then this is not it."
1,Horrible Product & Amazon Experience,"This piece of garbage did not work upon receipt and when I called to return the item, they had the gall to ask for a 15% restocking fee for an item that didn't even work! I will never deal with this company again and am even questioning if I am going to continue my Amazon shopping based on this experience. Couldn't even understand the people from Amazon and Store 123 when they returned my calls. It's called ENGLISH people. Official language of the United States."
1,Beware this company's shipping policy...,The company which fufills orders for this item has a contract with UPS that does not allow UPS to hold the item for pick up at the customer's convenience... I have better things to do than wait around all day for the UPS guy... I would not order from these people unless you know you can wait at home all day for delivery...
5,No one ever sang like Andrew! He was heart and soul in song!,"once one lets andrew wood into his soul, and this only happens after one feels the emotions of this record, the understanding of his downfall will be left with a smile, and pure real love in music and life will flow thru you and everyone you turn on to mother love bone. no one ever sang like andrew before, or ever will. his groove and approach is real feel......critics say things based on morals for the majority, and not on knowing what is really going on in the communication of music? andrew, stone, ament- were the best thing musically that has ever happened to me. i have been writing poetry, vs. and such for years, and i feel what they recorded!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The beginning of a genre.,"First off, let it be known that this is a really great album. They probably recieved more attention in hindsight, than they did while together. ""Mother Love Bone"" was kind of a stepping stone of sorts. Members of ""Green River"" split to become ""MLB"" and ""Mudhoney"", then ""MLB"" dissolved, and Jeff and Stone eventually became part of ""Pearl Jam"". Outside of the Northwest, ""MLB"" were most known for being on the ""Singles"" soundtrack. The singer OD'd which brought the band to an end, but not before they made a huge mark. Songs like ""Bone China"", ""Stargazer"", and ""Man Of Golden Words"" are absolutely amazing. Of course the track ""Chloe Dancer/Crown Of Thorns"" alone makes this worth having. In the end, ""Mother Love Bone"" gave us one beautiful rocking album, and in a way, ""Pearl Jam"" and ""Temple Of The Dog""."
5,This is Shangrila!,"I would recommend this fantastic album to everyone. Andrew Wood (lead singer) and his band create groundbreaking music which lead to the development of a sound later popularised by bands such as Pearl Jam. That said, the music of Mother Love Bone has it's own distinctive style. Andrew Wood's lyrics are intelligent and poetic. It is a great shame this talented musician is no longer with us."
2,So so,"I know these guys were the pre-cursor to Pearl Jam and really visionaries in the grunge movement, etc... But the CD couldn't really keep my interest... There are a lot of CDs in that genre that I still listen to on a regular basis - this is not one of them."
4,Glam-grunge masterpiece...,"Andrew Wood. Mother Love Bone. If it weren't for his death, what great heights would this beautiful poet have gone? At times gentle, at times raw, this record kicks!"
1,The Devil's Tomb,"The only thing good about the movie is Cuba Gooding Jr. and some hot chicks, Henry Rollins is thrown in there as a Priest of all things(which Is like asking a Protestant to give you a Catholic History). the plot has been done ad-verbatim in many other movies. it is long and boring,and Ron ""Ugly"" Perlman is there good choice.It even looks like a b-movie,I guess they owed Sean Connery's Son a Favor."
1,Don't they have anything lower than one star?,"Absolutely the last time I watch a movie without checking out the reviews first, even if it is free. An hour and a half of my life lost, waiting for something of some value to come out of that hole of a movie - never happened. Vague notions of a plot, intermixed with dumb wandering soldiers, looking to die. Something about fallen angels, but they never could put that thought completely together. A complete waste of time."
1,Non-stop Cliches!,Truly a low point in the art of film making. I'm not a fan of Cuba Gooding but I'm saddened to see him in this piece of garbage. I'd like to think that he at least made a decent wage from this but given the overall cheapness of the film I don't see how they could have afforded to.When discussing what makes it so bad I'd have to say the plot cliches are worse than the script or character cliches. The incredibly stupid actions of the military team members are an insult to the intelligence of all humans.I give the film one star for Cuba who did a respectable job of keeping a straight face while delivering such obviously flawed lines. There is nothing he could have possibly done to pull this film out of the hell-hole or bottomless pit that it resides in. I made the mistake of not knowing this was a straight to DVD release. I saw it on the shelf and said it couldn't be too bad with both Cuba and the guy from Aliens 4 and City of Lost Children. I feel for them both.
1,I would give it negative stars if possible,This movie is so bad. I couldn't make it more than 40 minutes into it before I switched to Choke - MUCH better movie!
5,This is what happens when writers go on strike!,"This film was done during the writers strike. The actors in this film did it mostly to keep camera crews, lighting crews, and every other job that no one thinks about, working. I say sit back and enjoy watching well known actors in a 'B' movie."
4,Entertaining for a low budget flick,"I was expecting much less from this movie. The beginning of the movie had me wondering how bad the movie was going to turn out to be, but it actually got better through out. Once the action started and the plot started coming together I was entertained for the rest of the movie. I just watched Terminator Salvation in the theaters which cost $200 million to make, and I actually found The Devil's Tomb more entertaining and I didn't feel like I wasted my money after watching it (unlike with Terminator). Give it a shot, you might like it."
1,Pass on this film,I'm not sure what I expected but I can tell you that I ended up disliking this film. I like Cuba Gooding so I thought I would give this movie a chance. My advice is to not waste your time or money on this film.
1,Why can't I give a 0??,"If I could give this movie zero stars, I would. Or even a negative rating. This is truly the WORST movie I have ever seen. The plot was idiotic, the acting was so-so, and the scenes were... grotesque. Honestly, I felt like throwing up after watching some of it. Whenever I see it in stores or pawn shops, I hide it from view because I don't think anyone should have to watch this complete crap!"
1,Needs to be Buried,"This is the kind of film that good actors would place on their 'films I'd like to forget I was in during my early career' vita. The sad part is that Cuba Gooding, Jr made this film after he won an Academy Award and acted in some very good films. But since 2001, his vita contains nothing but one lousy B movie after another and 'The Devil's Tomb' is no exception. Cuba Gooding sleepwalks though this terrible film that isn't even up to SYFY Channel standards. Here is hoping that his role in George Lucas' 'Red Tails' brings him back to A-list standards."
1,"As Charles Barkley would say ""turrrbull, turrbull""","So here's where actors and actresses who work as waiters and waitresses go. Most ""big name"" directors would tell these people ""keep your day job"".For Special OPs people they ride in an old Huey (low budget could not afford a Black Hawk). They use regular M4's with only flashlite attachments. No lasers or special sights (cheap budget).Cuba Gooding is pretty pathetic in this one. He shoots a ""zombie"" in the head, and one of his soldiers in another room asks ""what was that?"" Soldiers who are used to gunfire asking what a shot was? Franky G trying his worst to be a Jesse Ventura clone (a la Predator) comes off laughable. There's one scene where one female soldier starts shooting at a ""vision"" of her daughter, then two of her buddies join in shooting at nothing; emptying their mags in the process. - ""What were we shooting at?"" exclaims one of the idiot soldiers. Uh-boy.Most of the scenes are laughable and amateurish. Forget this STINKER!"
2,My fellow reviewer's,"This is a first for me, I agree with most my fellow reviewer's for a change. Cast, setting, directing, effects were all just right for a damn good movie. Then came the story itself, we've all seen so much better as others have mentioned in their reviews. This was a waste money and to think I looked everywhere for it before breaking down and buying it."
3,Standard Horror Pic,"Nothing new here. Same old horror story with demonic possession at its core. This movie was a waste of high end acting talent in Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ron Perlman who did nothing special to enhance the poor storyline. A few horror shock points that are just too blatant to not be expected. Sorry, but just not worth the hype."
3,"""A New Solider In A Very Old War"" ~ You Had Me At Nephilim","Well it appears as though I liked 'The Devil's Tomb' a little more than most of the other reviewers. I guess I'm just an old sentimentalist, I mean who doesn't enjoy a storyline involving Nephilim, demonic possession and the doorway to Hell? I sure do.On second thought that's about all it had to offer. The characterizations and dialogue was predictable and one-dimensional and the storyline somewhat uneven.The film also lacked the necessary energy and momentum required to carry the plot through to its eventual conclusion. There was an occasional moment here and there where it did succeed in creating an eerie, demonic atmosphere that was slightly reminiscent of 'Hellraiser' but that feeling didn't last long enough to keep the viewing audience interested.I'm probably being a little generous giving it a -3 Star- rating but I can't help myself, I'm a sucker for the subject matter."
2,This was promising...,"There wasnt much advertised on this and when I read about it on UHM, [...] I though Hmm, this looks pretty good. Good cast of actors, good description, this is worth a watch.Boy was I wrong. I barely got through this movie. Whats worse is the religious aspect that they throw at you toward the end. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone.This could have been a great movie, but alas another movie bites the dust, but if you must see it/own it Im sure it will be in the doller bin soon."
4,solid,"solid durable design, good function, good price. I am wondering what this copper-color is when the steel coating wears off.. is it solid copper?? Hard to believe.. should try magnet next time its around.."
5,I give it 5 stars...,"On the F'd up scale. Just on a whim, thought I'd put in HORDE (as in HORDE festival) and came across this heep of dung. If I knew you could make money off this I would have recorded my first grade music class."
2,Needs editing and updating,"I ordered this booklet despite the review above (which was very helpful, and is right on the money), because there didn't seem to be any other books offering what I wanted (recipes for homemade cosmetic products, mostly from easy-to-acquire and natural ingredients).The spelling is just atrocious - and repeatedly so, that's how we know it's spelling and not typos (how in the world can a book about cosmetics continuously misspell ""mortar and pestle"" as ""mortar and pistil"" - a flower part! And supposedly there is an editor - I certainly hope she was a friend doing a favor, not a ""professional"" editor!).Turns out I did find a MUCH better professional book: Creative Face: Make your own makeup by Maxine Nelson. Excellent, no misspellings, gorgeous pictures, and much easier recipes made from much simpler ingredients, with more information about why the ingredients are needed and what can and cannot be substituted.Sorry, Karen Bombeli - you really ought to fix your book!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This book should be a freebie that Somerset Cosmetic Company gives out because that is one of the only places that you can buy the ingredients to make these products. Yes, Virginia it is entirely possible to spend more money making your products than purchasing them at Sephora."
5,My favorite season,"This season has all you could ever want from MacGyver...Penny Parker and Murdoc in the same episode. It's got a brainwashed Jack, the root of MacGyver's gun problem and the first appearance of Cuba Gooding Jr. The end.(Also, this is the first season that the Mullet solidifies itself)"
1,"Pretentious facade, nothing behind it but sheer stupidity","This is what they must show in the Ninth Circle of Hell. The thing may appear deeply intellectual only to someone under 16, all those who have outgrown their pimples should know better. Bad acting abounds, with Blair Underwood being particularly unwatchable. Soderbergh is way overrated and has never been a favorite (O.K., videotape was fine, Traffic and Ocean's Eleven were adequate remakes of perfectly good originals, the rest is, hm...Lifetime quality), but Full Frontal is in another league...or circle."
2,"""Full Frontal""","The reason I purchased this movie and the only reason it's tolerable is because David Duchovny is in it. I am a loyal fan of Mr. Duchovny. I own all his movies as well as the complete X-Files series. Throughout the entire movie, I kept waiting for something to happen. I figured out, at the very beginning, that it was a story-within-a-story, story-within-a-story, story-within-a-story which was very confusing. The grainy quality of the ""real"" story made it seem amateurish. I was disappointed that David Duchovny only had about four scenes. He made the most of his few scenes, however,even though they were at the very end. What I didn't expect was his character's death from auto-erotic asphixiation. If the point of the movie is that Hollywood celebrity-types lead boring, pointless, empty lives, it lived up to its expectations. The ""f"" word was used too many times. Whoever wrote the dialogue has a very limited vocabulary."
1,"Pretentious, Boring, Rudderless","Apparently the script, sound equipment and several cameras were lost on the way to the set of this dull film.I imagine the director telling his actors: ""More mumbling--more mumbling! I nearly understood some of the dialogue in the last take!"" Then he turned to his cameraman and told him to slop another jar of vaseline on the lens.I could put up with some of the pretentious art-school escapades of this movie if the story was worth following, but there IS no story. A bunch of LA people with direct and tangenital ties to the entertainment business wander along for two hours--that's the story. Woopee.The one and only redeeming thing in this meandering piece of junk is the veterinarian who comes to check out David Hyde Pierce's sick dog and sticks around to eat hash brownies. I don't know who the actress is, but she is a breath of fresh air in the midst of this smelly waste of time."
3,Occasional wit amid the self-indulgence,"Done in cinema-verite style, the story of ""Full Frontal"" follows, in disjointed fashion, several people connected to the making of a film-within-a-film, ""Rendezvous,"" as their loopy but not very interesting lives careen toward a climactic party scene. The film being made, starring Julia Roberts and Blair Underwood, is self-indulgent and pretentious (though at least shot on good quality film and easy on the eye, in contrast to the rest). The same, alas, can be said of the whole enterprise, despite some good performances, particularly from David Hyde Pierce, and witty dialogue. Grainy, out-of-focus and shaky camerawork is apparently meant to lend an air of authenticity but merely tries the viewer's patience, not to mention inner-ear equilibrium. Occasional moments of satire that hit their target and some surprising cameos from the likes of Brad Pitt and David Duchovny are not enough to make this one worth sitting through."
3,not too good but not too bad...,"...just make liberal use of the Fast Forward button!As others have noted, this is a pretty disjointed random set of vignettes, many of them full of film school pompousness and indie cliches, but there are some gems here and there.The really HIGH SCHOOL dead spots though, like the interminable scenes on the set of a contemporary artsy fartsy avant Hitler play, simply beg to be skipped through.I recommend watching this film as a collection of notoriously uneven shorts. Just skip through the garbage and enjoy what gems you can find.Certainly would not buy it though...God bless Netflix!"
3,"It's a bit out there, yet still entertaining.","Ever since I saw `Traffic', I have been catching up on what I have been missing of the brilliance of Stephen Soderbergh. Full Frontal, though extremely stripped down and roughed out, is still interesting and entertaining enough inspire repeat viewings; and each viewing became more entertaining than the last. If you enjoy a mixed bag of interpersonal relationships with a bit of satire and improvisation that doesn't take itself too seriously, this is the film for you."
2,prettty ucked up if you tell me,"this is a movie in a movie inside of a movie(what the **it) some good acting with David Hyde Pierce, Nicky Katt and David Duchovny but the others are wasted. Soderbergh is a great director but this one feels funky and wrong. a nice cameo appereance though by Brad Pitt. otherwise dont waste your time with this one people, seeing it one is good enough for me"
1,please pass the no-dozz,"Has to be the worst movie i have ever bought on DVD, and i own over 400 titles. I kept waiting for it to get better, but it just got worse. Why these stars would waste their time and ours is beyond me. I wish I could go back in time and never purchase and therefore not watch this poor excuse for a movie, I would. You would think with the star line-up, it would be better, but it's not. Please don't buy this unless you need a gift for someone you hate! Trust me, it is soooo bad!"
2,Soderbergh does his Hollywood film..,"...but I end up not liking it as much as Altman's 'The Player' or Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' and about the only thing going for this are the big stars doing small bit parts and cameos, ala 'The Player'. Catherine Keener and David Hyde Pierce however do flex decent acting chops here. Ducovney should have never accepted an asphyxiation role...those roles are difficult to recover from. I wonder what my favorite bitchy movie reviewer (and hero) Rex Reed would have to say about this?...""David D. Chokes in an anti-climatic Soderbergh film. Is Put on Hold""...I don't like Blair Underwood. I don't know why. He's just not my type. Julia is wasted here. One should see happier Julia Roberts movies, not this bit of depressed and depressive effluvia. My overall advice: see side by side with 'The Player' and decide which is the better movie. I bet you'll go with 'The Player'.."
1,Has a lot of labels but just ajoke with our money!!!!,"Im just a computer programmer but im able to make movies better than this poor no funny plastic thing called full frontal. Who smiles for this movie never will understand whats smart and funny, just will have commanders and read labels and get a opinion. Who like this are dummies. Yes dummies, adults from new generation... Very bad..."
1,A [$] waste of two hours of my life,"This movie was presented to me as an ""unofficial sequel"" to ""Sex, Lies and Videotape,"" so when my brother and wife suggested I see it with them, I accepted.Fifteen minutes into this waste of film, I was ready to leave, but didn't want to hurt my brother, who really wanted to see it. After we left, I found out he felt the same way.This picture is poorly written, confusingly filmed, badly edited, mediocrely acted, and, as far as I can tell, is this year's attempt by a major Hollywood studio to prove it's not just a money-making machine, but that they care about ART! They have failed. If you feel you simply MUST see it, get it as a rental. You'll still waste the time, but at least you can waste it cheaply."
1,"This movie is awful, just awful","This was a very bad movie. It was very disjointed, confusing, no story and in my opinion worthless. The movie was presented in a documentary style about making a movie. The acting was very poor and the script was awful. That is something that I don't say very often because I am the one that likes B movies. The only reason that I would have given this movie 2 stars would have been that David Duchovny was totally nude. Well, the scene was about 2 seconds long, blurry and shot at an angle that you knew that he had something between his legs, but you really couldn't see it well enough to say it was worth the movie price. Don't waste your time with this one, it isn't worth the plastic that it is packaged in."
2,"Excruciating, but not absolutely worthless ;-)","There is a style, or class, or school of comedy characterized by something bad, or lame being repeated over and over until it becomes funny. There is something like this going on here with ""Full Frontal"". I saw this picture in a theater with six other people, and three of them walked out after twenty minutes. Too bad, really, since the chuckles only started to occur after the proceedings had worn you absolutely down, and twenty minutes into the picture you were only JUST starting to get exasperated. Could be that this film works better on the small screen, which I found to be the case with Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"", another excruciating experience. Warning! By no means see this movie with another recent Soderbergh picture ""Solaris"", or you may subsequently need therapy."
1,The worst film I've ever seen.,After about an hour into this film I asked my friend if we could leave. He wanted to stay because we'd already paid for the tickets. I told him that I didn't care taht I would want these couple of hours of my life back later. I was right.There was nothing remotely entertaining about the film. I often enjoy bad art for the sake of bad art but this was undigestable.
4,The horrors of the German death camps.,"Delbo is a French Resistance person who is caught by the Germans and put in their death camps. The last camp she served in was Auschwitz. In this very short book she writes of the horrors of the death camps. The writing is almost dream like (or nightmare like). One might have to read the passages twice in order to understand what she is trying to pass along.What can you say about these books. They describe man's cruelty to his fellow man. They all point to the suffering of those imprisoned in these camps. Because of this, they are all good reads, and Delbo's book is no different. Since Delbo is not Jewish, one can see that all types of people were killed off by the Nazis.Since this book is so short, a person can finish this off in two to four hours. The perspective gained might help to prevent such suffering in the future."
4,The Heist,"A fun flick, with beautiful Brosnan growing into his bonesas he hit age 35. An elegant man playing a small-time hoodis a nice contrast. Note the hair slicked back. AudreyWood plays the bubble-headed moll who divides her favorsbetween Brosnan and Skerrit, showing little emotion for eitherguy. Nice seedy race track atmosphere, pretty hot love scenes,and a light hearted adio accompanied by the Spanish versionof ""My Way"". Recommended.Adrienne Fischier, New York City"
5,Sexy & Sophisticated,"While I do not rate Pierce Brosnan as one of the all-time great actors, I must say that for an action movie, tthis is one of my favorites. Pierce possesses wit and charm that you would not see again until 1999's Thomas Crown Affair."" The plot is defined and the action is top-notch. Recommended for all, especially those of you who adore Pierce brosnan."
5,Beautiful horses -- beautiful Pierce!,I am so glad that I bought this movie -- Pierce Brosnan really knows his way around women and horses. I enjoyed the story.
2,Poor at best,"The movie is a cheap attempt at a ""sting"" like remake and fails as such. If you are familar with San diego then the movie is somewhat enjoyable as you get to see some of the sights as they were 20 years ago."
2,"Brosnan's good, but movie doesn't make it around the track","This movie is a poorly made farce, on a par with a bad ""I Love Lucy"" episode. Its only virtues are a fine performance by Pierce Brosnan, showing the ""action"" talent he later developed as Thomas Crowne and James Bond, and the Gypsy Kings' cover of ""My Way"".Chewing gum for the mind.Deserves zero stars, if it weren't for Brosnan."
3,A little more detail would have made it a good one,"Geoffrey Regan's books are entertaining. Read his Military blunders 1&2, which by the way were much better books than this one. He wishes to elaborate on the first true crusader, Heraclius but starts off with his typical satire, related to the times of Constantine's father and the birth of Byzantium. The early history of Byzantium was unnecessary. He could have written more on Heraclius himself. The lack of description of key battles and undertakings do not do justice to a man who deserves more. There are a couple of interesting pictures. On the good aspect of the book. One gets to read a bit of interesting history and legends. The author uses good judgement to question the authenticity of the True Cross and the Holy Sepulchre. Overall i'd say its a good book to keep but i wont recommend buying the hardback version."
4,Understated,I enjoyed this movie very much. True it's not a classic war film but it stands out among the run-of-the-mill TV type of fare. The ending was curiously muted but it made the film raise itself a few notches. The weaponry was accurate (although I doubt the silencers used on both pistol and carbine were WW2 issue) and the uniforms tally with the photographs I have seen of USMC reconnaisance units. Definitely Hugh O'Brian's best work.
1,Scenes are missing,"This video is a disappointment. The editors at MGM Home Entertainment decided to delete some scenes from this film. Specifically, some scenes featuring the lovely Tisa Chang are not on this DVD. When watching a film for free on TV, you expect some scenes to go missing to make room for commercials. But when you actually pay for a film, you expect to get the whole thing. Unfortunately this is not the case with MGM products.I remember watching this movie 30+ years ago and being enthralled by Ms Chang and her wonderfully-fitting slacks. I waited decades for this film to become available on video. What a disappointment to finally be able to get the video only to find that some of the most interesting scenes have been left out."
4,Minor but Still Captivating,Good performances and suspenseful action sequences highlight this low key WWII film about a small group of Marines sent on a special mission on a Japanese occupied island. There is a certain charm about this film and I believe it comes from the performances from the three main characters. Hugh O'Brian's stoic demeanor is very credible and he has you guessing all the time about just what makes him tick. James Mitchum pulled from his regular duties and attached to this team is generally perplexed and left in the dark. This film is told from Mitchum's point of view and he reflects the curiosity of the viewer. Mickey Rooney represents a balance and some semblance of reason between military expedience and human rationality of the actions and characters in the film. Though it may be minor this film never fails to hold your interest and has always been very captivating.
3,War in the Phillipines,"This movie was ok, but it was obviously made in late 1960's, as some of the props and mannerisms seem to be out of place for WW2. Mickey Rooney is good, but he was starting to show his age. The plot also wanders and is a bit hard to follow sometimes. This movie is ok, but its not fantastic."
1,Don't waste your time!!!,"Lucky for me, I saw this movie on TV and did not waste my money on buying it. I my opinion, this is one of the worst WWII movies that I have ever seen. It would be a lot easier to list the good points of the movie however, there are none. Its a very bad ""B"" war movie; the acting is really bad, blood looks like red paint, soldiers make stupid moves & of course get killed, the Japanese use American tanks, very bad music that plays in the background, etc. Basically, it is a very cheap movie and it shows right from the beginning. I'm not sure what movie was worse; Ambush Bay or Anzio!!If you want to see good WWII movies, then watch: 12 o'clock High, Sink The Bismark, Objective Burma, They Were Expendable, Battleground, Wing And A Prayer, Battle of Britain, The Train, Run Silent Run Deep, Das Boat,The Great Escape, Saving Private Ryan, Band Of Brothers, Where Eagles Dare, The Longest Day."
3,Back hills mystery,"Kinda corny at first, but then became interesting. Easy to remember the story, didn't jump around. I would read more."
4,good,love the setting love the book and i will read more on this author.It is so homey and almost real to life
4,Interesting,It kept my interest and would read another book from the author. A good character study at the very end.
4,Enjoyable read,Many twists & turns with a little humor thrown in. Enjoyed the book & wanted to keep reading until the mystery was solved.
3,Dangerous Undertaking,"I did enjoy this book, it had a bit of everything. A mystery involving greed, family politics, corruption, a little humour and a dash of romance. The setting of the novel in the Appalchian Mountains added to the attraction.Barry the main character is an ex policeman who has returned to help run the family undertaking business when his father becomes ill. The story starts with a bang when Barry is shot at a funeral by the grandson of the woman he is burying. He becomes drawn into the investigation which takes quite a few twists and turns.I would have rated this book higher but to me the ending was a cop out. There were differing levels of accountability for some of the characters. But overall it was an entertaining read."
5,7 Bridges Organic Home Brew,I have tried several home brew kits from 7 Bridges Coop and each one has produced excellent tasting beer. I found that a little extra aging on these kits makes a big difference in the sharpness of the bittering. You won't be disapointed.
5,AWESOME! EVERYTHING YOU WANT AND MORE!,"A MUST HAVE for Tina fans! This collection has all of her early rockin' soul stuff. Four CD's of great material at an incredible price! Isn't missing one song, and it is remastered great. Trust me, buy it!"
3,The definitive anthology for the collector,"I agree with the first reviewer that this is the early ""raw"" stuff. Quite frankly, a straight listening through got a little tiresome: for me, many of the arrangements seemed to blur together. However since most of these tracks appear on various single discs that don't cost much less, this is a worthy investment. You could ""burn"" your favorite tracks onto CD or cassette and have a killer best-of collection. Since all the songs are downloadable here, it should be easy to make an informed decision."
1,Didn't change anything,I love the idea of a natural remedy for teething so I ordered the tablets and the gel. I saw no change in the irritability in my daughter. I switched back to Baby Orajel and have seen a huge improvement. Would not buy this product again.
4,Lillian's best yet,"By far, Lillian's best yet. Her previous writings were way too heady for me, but this one held my attention. For those looking for the juicy tidbits of Faderman's personal life, this book pretty much hits the spot. I am looking forward to the sequel -- this woman has much more to tell."
5,A very very good anime!,"I have alse seen the TV-episodes, and they're much better, but the OAVs introduce every character! If you are going to buy the TV-episodes, buy these first. You will really enjoy it! Isaki apam mehinam eto caffe nam!"
2,What is the deal with the aliens?!,"The thing I do like about this series is the humor is kinda charming. Wow... I wonder if most teenage boys really think like that. Somehow I feel a bit sorry for Takakura,...but anyway...I just can't understand it: what's with the aliens?! It seems that every other anime series has to have megalomaniac evil aliens trying to take over the world, and only a group of cutesy Japanese teenagers can save us! Needless to say, this series has abundant cliches.Also, I thought Sae's teddy bear was creepy, and I didn't understand the part where all these teddy bears dance in the forest. It was supposed to be cute, but it just confused me and creeped me out. And the end credit part was just bizarre... and usually I thrive on the bizarre!..."
4,Ramsey QAMP 40 easy-build kit,"I built the kit and it worked fine , but being a HAM , I could not leave well enough alone and added a fan and BNC connectors. The kit is great for voice and CW , but I felt needed a better cooling capability for PSK and other digital modes. I plan to get other kits in this line to get a bit of extra punch to my FT817 radio."
1,Unviewable,"I intend to return this video as the sound quality as well as picture quality are very, very poor. I was extremely disappointed as I have been trying to find the old BBC presentation of this story and thought this was it!!"
1,I learned something from this...,"THis is what I learned: You CAN'T DO David Copperfield in TWO hours, I don't care how talented you are...This movie is a crying shame. Here's a good example: Lawrence Olivier is cast as Mr. Creakle, and he's wonderful, he's OLIVIER, but he's on screen for maybe a total of two minutes, before the screenplay dashes madly on...The screenwriter, by the way, is totally out of his mind, framing the story in flashbacks...Oh, it's a shame. Ralph Richardson is perfect as Mr. Micawber, but there isn't TIME to develope any character, not even Micawber! Aunt Betsy, Mr. Dick? They come and go, as if they were simply walk-ons! This could have been something special, instead it's simply a crying shame. BE WARNED! If you love Dickens, DON'T WATCH THIS! IT will break your heart."
1,Unwatchable,"I had to return this video as the sound quality and video transfer were so poor. The adaptation may have been ok, but I will have to wait till I find a better transfer."
1,Poor customer service,"The Jeanie Rub was not right from the time I got it. By 5 weeks it was falling apart. Because it was over a month I could not return it. They wouldn't even send a replacement. If your product can't make it 5 weeks you should bend over backwards to make it right. But no, I had to ship it back to the manufacturer for service, at my expence! After almost a month and 16 bucks in shipping , I still don't have it. That's bad service!"
4,Massager,This is a very good product. I had one for 20 years untill I had to buy this one. And they was very good at shipping.
5,30 years old and still running,"My husband and I are very active. He is preparing to run his 27th marathon in January 2013. This Jennie Rub is nothing short of marvelous. 30 years of marvelous, in fact. I bought it from a chiropracter way back then. I use it literally every day on my husband's back and legs and at 67 he is going strong. I also did a half marathon in November 2012 to celebrate turning 69. I have R/A but with the tons of exercise and fitness I have and the jennie rub life is good. (Actually holding the massager totally loosens up my hands. I set it on the floor and put my feet on it when I first get up. I tell athletes to buy this unit. It is pricey but look how long it has lasted. Also people spend as much on a fine pair of running shoes. I just had to share this with you all.Linda Snavely"
1,Cheap version of Morfam's massager,"I'm very disappointed in this massager. It seems to be a cheap version of Morfam's quality massager. This one must have a smaller or less powerful motor, and the bottom vinyl (or whatever) covering does not slide nearly as easily as Morfam's massager."
5,Excellent massager,"When purchasing this massager, I was looking for one similar to the massager my chiropractor uses. This massager turned out to be exactly what I was looking for (I am wondering if Jeanie Rub is the actual brand my Chiropractor uses). The massager is very simple .. it vibrates at speeds you can adjust by turning a knob. It has a lot of available power (for an intense massage if you can handle it). At the highest setting, the person giving the massage may want gloves. I think this massager is soundly engineered for durability. It seems to be very sturdy. It also has a long power cord which is nice."
5,The Best Book Ever!,I think the story was a good book because the teacher said `now look this is kindergarten and in kindergarten we share everything. My favorite part is when they screamed and the teacher came. My favorite character is Amanda because how she screams. I think the pictures were good pictures. The story did not make me remind me of nothing. I would recommend this book to my parents.
4,The Best Book Ever,"I think We Share Everything was a good book because it was funny. My favorite part was when Connor yelled. The funniest part was when they shared their clothes. I liked the illustrations because they used bright colors. My favorite character is Connor because when he wanted the book he said give me that book if you don,t give me that book am going scream and yell."
5,The Best Book,"I thought the book was a great book. My favorite part was when Amanda screamed. The teacher was my favorite character because she kept saying, ""now look this is kindergarten in kindergarten we share we share everything'. I thought the book was funny because the boy and the girl switch shirts. I thought that the pictures were great. I would recommend this book to the teachers."
5,MY FAVORITE BOOK,I really enjoyed the book We Share Everything by Robert Munsch. This book is good for first graders and under because it's a funny book for first graders and under. If I had a brother or sister under first grade I would read it to them. If I had the book We Share everything I would read it to my sister who is one or two. She would not understand but she will still like it. She likes any story I read to her. My favorite character is Amanda. I really enjoyed the book We Share Everything.
1,Beware of this gender-biased book!,"The author reinforces gender stereotypes with a ""humorous"" ending where the girl and boy exchange clothes, resulting in a teacher exclaiming to the boy about his wearing pink pants. (You can tell it's sexist when you realize that navy blue pants wouldn't have worked.) Imagine how gender non-conforming children feel to have their likes ridiculed in this way."
2,Ending does not ring true,"Yes, the two irrepressibly cute characters in this book do indeed share everything. In fact, in the end the boy and girl end up taking off their clothes and switching them with each other while in their kindergarten classroom. Having taught kindergarteners within the last five years, this ending rang completely false with me. This is NOT behavior typical of kindergarteners, but more that of toddlers and young preschoolers. The kindergarteners I taught would not be caught dead taking their clothes off at school! Munsch strikes out on this one."
1,"Nonsense, and not in a good way","I guess this is probably for older kids, but since my 3-year-old really enjoys other Munsch books I bought a used copy of this when I saw it in a store. I should have read it entirely before buying it. The sarcasm was lost on her (obviously), but I agree with the other reviewer who said that this book relies on gendered stereotypes and bad behavior. Boys and girls can wear whatever they want, and while it's obviously inappropriate for school-aged children to undress in class, that was not the issue the teacher in the book focused on. She focused on the boy wearing pink. It's also really confusing to younger readers who are being taught that they have to learn to share, which the 2- and 3-year-old set are trying to learn. There's nothing wrong with a kindergarten teacher telling her students they have to share classroom materials."
5,Another winner for Munsch,"Sharing is a major issue in early childhood classrooms. Amanda and Jeremiah have issues sharing toys on their first day of kindergarten. The teacher sweetly reminds the children that ""We share everything"". When they cannot find something to share, they exchange shoes, then shirts. This continues until they are wearing each other's clothes. The book is hilarious. In my professional opinion, children will not take this to a higher level and think too much about exchanging clothes. This is a great book for kindergarteners."
4,It was a good book.,"It was a good book. There was a girl named Amanda and a boy Jeremiah. When the boy yelled, ""Give me that book"" to the girl it was funny. When the girl told the boy, ""Give me that block!"", the boy said, ""No, I got this block first."" Robert Munsch is a good writer and makes the book interesting."
2,we share everything an ok book,The book We Share everything was good book. My favorite part was when Jeremiah and Amanda were fighting for everything. The funniest part was when they where changing their shoes. My favorite character were the two little kids it is because they where fighting for everything. This book has good pictures. This book reminds me about myself when I was little and fighting with my sister.
5,we shear everything was a good book.,"The book was good because it was so funny. My favorite part was when Jeremiah was screaming because the girl did not what to share her stuff. The teacher said, ""In kindergarten, we share everything."" Amanda was my favorite character because she is so humorous. I think the illustrations where pretty good and funny. This book made me remember that in kindergarten, we had to share. Our parents should read the book. This book is good and I recommend you read it."
5,we share everything was,"I think this book is good to listen to and read. I think this book is a good and funny book too. This book will be interesting for my little cousins and my little sister. When I heard this book, I thought it was funny and I started laughing. They were learning how to share in kindergarten they didn't want to share when they first got to kindergarten. I liked the part were the little kids didn't want to share anything and the kindergarten teacher came out and say, ""Now look, this is kindergarten, and in kindergarten we share everything""."
4,we share everthing was a good book.,This book is funny to read and listen to.It reminds me about my cousin that is in Kindergarten. This story is cool because little kids can read it. Kids like to read lots of books. The funniest part is when they're in trouble. My favorite character is Amanda and Jeremiah because they act funny. I recommend the book to older kids.
1,If it aint broke......,"After listening to a few of the excerpts of this sad album, I almost puked. I don't have to buy this album to know it stinks. And dispite what the previous reviewer says, the orginal was much better. Sure some of it is a little hoakey by today's standards and styles, but look when it was written. I can't believe Jeff Wayne gave his permission for this schlock."
5,"Great product, but....","......the price was the lowest available, but only allowed to buy one. That's unfortunate, because I wanted to purchase at least two. Oh well, guess I can't be greedy."
4,Sarah and Orchestras,"Great singers do not need big ensembles. Although this is a CD of high merit, the orchestra and jazz ensemble obsure the beauty, enchantment and (vocal)timbre changes that Sarah Vaughan so often exhibits in her works. Although I love vocal virtuosity, the vocal acrobatics presented here are a bit much; but, due to the quality of some songs selected, I will only assume, Sarah had no choice. Thank goodness the song ""Feelings"" was not written, as of yet (I think), during the time this album of songs was produced. However, for those who prefer big orchestras accompanying singers, this is the album for you."
2,I expected more from this,"I expected more from this DVD. By more I mean more details, more tips, more explanations. I also expected s section on jumps and drops, after all it says ""freeride"" in the title, but no. It's all Urban riding."
4,A-Z Horse Health Problems,Sort of a structurally odd book they way it is organized. It has good information in it and photographs. Some photos may be disturbing to children or the squeamish.
2,A-Z Horse Diseases and Health Problems,"I felt that this book left a lot to be desired and was written for the layperson with NO medical background. The UC Davis Book of Horses is a much more complete reference book , absolutely worth the extra cost."
1,Taste,"Can't get past the bad taste, Passionflower tea does work for helping you relax and sleep, but this particular brand has such a bad taste, it makes it impossible to drink. You may try mixing it with something else"
3,Sponge Mop Fakery,"Anyone can buy the Quickie Automatic Sponge Mop in a local supermarket or hardware store. But Amazon says this is the ""Original"" version, as confirmed by the picture. It's got a yellow sponge and a metal plate. The local store sponge mops have blue sponges (the difference is more than just color!) and plastic plates.So I wasted my time ordering the ""Original"" from Amazon. What I received is the plastic version, the same one available in any supermarket. Amazon should label the mop truthfully: get rid of the word ""Original"" and display the blue color instead of the original yellow. In other words, make the picture match the product you ship."
2,wrote to company before. Sponge just moves dirt around does not scrub or clean. Time to use real sponge with cellulose holes.,I chose this rating because the company has not changed the quality of the sponge after my last communication. Sponge moves dirt around. It has no fibers to clean.A good old fashioned cellulose sponge with holes would be the better product.It is a waste of money. The only positive is the squeeze technology. That is good.My floors are just as dirty before the cleaning as after.
1,These treats are dangerous,"These treats made my dog seriously ill with kidney failure. We had been feeding our dogs these treats for months, then suddenly both our dogs became ill. We almost lost our smaller dog, a Cavalier King Charles. While the FDA is still investigating, these treats continue to be sold. In our small town there were four cases diagnosed within one week, and our newspaper, the Longmont Times Call, ran a front page story on it. Since then I've been contacted by people from across the US who have been affected, and we have created a web site dedicated to this issue: [...]"
1,Dog got sick - throwing up,"Fed these to my 40 pound jack russell/beagle mix male dog. He got sick and threw up. He is a tank and can eat pretty much anything. I had purchased them in 2007. I put them away in my cupboard and then heard about the recall and never took them out till tonight. I just wanted you to know that if your dog starts to vomit or not feel right, STOP FEEDING THE TREATS TO HIM. Bag says PRODUCT OF CHINA. And is one of the recalled items from PetSmart where I bought them. Listen to your instincts and stop feeding him the treats at any sign of illness."
1,RECALL DANGER,"[...]Please check this out and DO NOT feed these to your pets. Take them back to where you bought them and make them aware, MADE IN CHINA."
3,"Good product, but made in china so there are risks","As far as I can tell, these chicken jerky strips are a good, natural product. Even so, they do say clearly on the label that these are made in China, making them somewhat risky (because of the quiet jerky-poisoning cases of 2007). Another concern - between Dec. 2008 and Feb. 2009, the costs of these went from about 11.00 to about 16.75 on amazon. At that price, it becomes both safer and more cost effective to just make jerky yourself from USDA grade chicken!"
1,Mis-represented product,"When I searched in Amazon for ""chicken jerky treats made in USA"" this product was listed. No where in the product discription did it mention the country of origin. I purchased this product in a smaller size from a local retailer and the package said ""MADE IN USA"" so I naturally assumed that the 20 ounce tub would be the same. What a surprize. When the package arrived I opened it and gave a piece to my dog, then I noticed that the label said ""PRODUCT OF CHINA""! I cannot give this to my dog as it causes severe symptoms.Either Amazon is misrepresenting the product as Made in USA or the manufacturer is. In either case, I have learned my lesson, NEVER BUY DOG TREATS FROM AMAZON."
1,Made in China,I purchased this item several years ago and discovered that it comes from China and is not something that you want to feed your dog unless you want it to catch bird flu.
5,"Good for me, good for you!",This product is a very good purchase. The price is cheap vs all the other competitors and my dog loves them.. You can't go wrong..
1,Not made in USA,I made a mistake when I ordered these. I will not buy them again since it is a product of China. My dog got sick on similar strips made in China two years ago. The product explanation for these strips did not state that these are made in China. It should be part of the description since there have been recalls on chicken and duck strips made in China by at least Pet Smart recently.
3,wheare are these made?,My dogs loved these but I stopped getting them because they came from China and the issues related to chicken and dog treats from China. I'd like to get them again. Can someone that has used them recently tell me if they still come form china?
5,Great treat...,"I have been giving these to my dog and he just loves them, they are low fat and high protein treats."
3,My dog loves these!,I've been giving these to my dog for the last 6 months and these are his favorite treats. However I thought these were not irradiated but it turns out they are. I think I will look into the all natural breast tenders even though they are more expensive. In the long run it's better for your dog.
5,Achieves unequalled depth,Wow! I just got through with this book and it blew my mind. This book is very personal and telling. This book is not just another story with unrealistic character development and ridiculously fantastical scenarios. Each character is skillfully introduced and developed with amazing realism.I really liked the chapter introduction. They relate the happenings in the book with a poem about the characteristics of waves. They are very beautiful but subtly scientific also!This book reminded me that sometimes we need to step back from our lives to evaluate what we are doing with ourselves. I highly recommend it!!!
5,Gorgeous Color,"Just the right amount of shimmer, absolutely beautiful. I love BE and I love browns, this one gives me a great overall glow"
5,Sydney IHE,Ol' Lady Grizelda by Justin Matott is a fabulous book about when you were a little boy. Ol' Lady Grizelda likes to eat kids stew. Ol' Lady Grizelda lives up on a hill and a little boy lives below Ol' Lady Grizelda. At midnight they see her planting peas and looking for treasure with keys.
5,A treasure. The illustrations are fabulous.,"As an elementary school teacher, I was given this book as a birthday present. I was completely delighted and touched by this sweet story of understanding and tolerance. It took a bit of practice to read it aloud with fluency, but my students loved listening to it when I finally got the rhythm. A wonderful book with a great message. Perfect for any age."
4,Granddaughter likes pink,Perfect compliment to the pink scooter received at Christmas -- priced right. She has not complained so it must be ok (she's 6 -- what does she know right?)
5,Great fit!!,First helmet my daughter has ever worn that actually fit perfectly. Not too tight...not too loose. Very comfortable and I like how it molds her head well.
4,"good quality,good deal","I'd like to say the sport helmet is really worth the prices i bought it on Amazon.My daughter love it as soon as she received it. The helmet is tough and strong,and the corlor is lovely. She said feeling very comfortable and cool once putting it on.I recommend it to girls under 125cm height. A good deal!"
5,Great helmet for my preteen!!,I bought this helmet to match my daughter's new bike for Christmas. It is a nice size and looks really sleek. I know she will love it.
3,"Seems nice, too big for 5.5 yo","The helmet seems nice, but it swims on my 5.5 yo. The front of the packaging says ""8+ Youth"". I don't know if this means it is intended for 8 year olds and older, but that would seem to be the case based on how it fit my child. The back says ""Complies with CPSC Safety standards for Bicycle Helmets for persons age 5 and older"".The back of that package also says ""Razor ... used by Permission."" ""Imported by Kent International, Inc."" ""Made in China"""
1,Not for kids,"From reviews I thought this will the right , sturdy helmet fro my 5 & 7 yr old kids. WRONG.The helmet is large enough to fit my head; unfortunately kids could hardly stop themselves from carving their name on helmets and ruining it thoroughly that they are hardly in position to return. Guess I will keep one for Mrs & paint another black so I can use it :)"
2,**NOT for 5 yrs and up as indicated,"This is NOT for 5 years and up as the description indicates. Packaging that arrived with helmet states for 8 years and up. It is WAY TOO BIG for my 6 1/2 year daughter. Don't have time to order another as skateboard camp starts on Monday. Very frustrating. However, the helmet itself appears to be great quality and looks great. amazon should update the description."
2,too small for an eight year old,"I bought this product for my stepdaughter's 8th birthday because it indicated 8 years and older. It was too small. The very next day, I was riding through the park and saw a 5 year old with this helmet on.Otherwise - it is a really cute helmet. Just make sure to measure your child's skull and not go for ""age range"""
5,Comfortable,My daughter always complained about her other helmet. But she says this one is very comfortable. She even forgets to take it off after riding. She loves the color too.
5,Good fit & comfortable,"Got this for my grade school age daughter. It provides a good fit for her with little tendency to roll back. Chin strap with a plastic clasp is a cinch to do and undo. It adjusted just right to keep everything in place. She says it is comfortable and has no complaints about any hot spots from ill-placed pads, and I see no red marks from pressure points after she wears it. No durability issues after a year of using this - no cracks, no heat degradation, no color fading and it even seems to have pretty good scratch resistance...all the color is intact with no obvious damage after a year. Would buy again."
5,Pink Razor Helmut,Great helmet- fits my grandaughter perfectly and is just as described. I love it and it looks great with the pink razor skooter. Good protection also.
5,Exactly what I expected,Her helmet arrived on time and in perfect condition. She loves it because of the metallic shimmer. It's everything I hoped it would be and at a fair price.
5,I can't wait!,"I can't wait to give this to my daughter for Christmas, along with her new Razor e300s scooter. It's the exact same color! She's going to be thrilled!"
3,Shoe Review,"Nice shoes, but they do not run true to size. Keep in mind you may have to go up a size or width. They are good for weekends or if you work in a casual work enviroment. They are somewhat comfortable, but not as stable as they need to be. I slipped on them so be careful."
5,Great,These wheels are definately worth more than I paid for there not the best but for there price there pretty damn good
3,Bizarre package of good live Stray Cats material.,"The Stray Cats were always a great bar band, so another live collection is always welcome. And this release boasts excellent sound quality. But the packaging is odd, to say the least. Somehow one song is actually repeated twice on the CD (the liner notes refer to it as ""Make Up Your Mind"" and ""Please Make Up Your Mind""; in fact it's ""Double Talkin' Baby""), and producer Dave Edmunds is listed as a band member. But once you get past these quirks, it's an okay slice of live Cats."
4,what are they up to now?,"f you love these guys as much as i do, you owe it to yourself to pick up the ""Swing Cats"" CD. A repository of ex-Stray Cats' Slim Jim Phantom & Lee Rocker plus ex-members of the Polecats, the Swing Cats continue the Stray Cats conventions while covering artists as diverse as Carl Perkins, Hank Williams Sr. (""Mind Your Own Business"") and Benny Goodman, with vocals supplied by an array of guests. Quite Good! Recorded at the Mint on Pico in los Angeles!"
2,WHILE it worked...........,"Lasted 10 months then ON/OFF switch stopped working. But, while it worked it was a nice little item. Ten months of use is nothing to be proud of. Maybe that's why it's no longer available.Not the first time Black and Decker has let me down. But, it's the last time."
4,I like the size!,The coffee maker is your regular automatic drip coffee maker. I just wanted something a little bigger that the 4 cup especially when you have an a friend over. The 4 cup just wasn't enough for 2 big cups of coffee and this 5 cup is just perfect. I don't know what size cups they think of when they create the machines but 4 cups is never 4 cups! it's less.This one works for me.
4,Tried others,"Use it every day, all day. First one I owned lasted about five years. Keeps coffee hot without changing taste."
4,BD Coffee Maker,This item was a Christmas gift to my daughter and her fiance. Their comments were quite favorable as to the coffee produced and the over all ease of use of the machine.
5,Great Little coffee Maker!,Wow! What an easy to use coffee maker. It is very easy to program. Just what a one coffee-drinking memebr household needs.
1,JUNK!,This coffee pot leaks water all over the counter. The coffee grinds back up into the water area requiring extra effort to clean.
4,"Interesting in light of the ""K-PAX"" craze!","This book is particularly interesting in light of Gene Brewer's novel (and now film) ""K-PAX"", based on ""The Jet-Propelled Couch"" episode in this book. In this episode, we meet the original model for prot -- not a homeless person, but a respected scientist. Conjecture has it that he may have been science fiction writer Cordwainer Smith. In any event the story is fascinating, and Lindner writes in a clear, mature and intelligent style. Well worth it!"
5,"Correction to Millikan ""review""","Sorry to disappoint potential readers, but Lindner's ""The Fifty-Minute Hour"" was NOT a source for the James Dean film, ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" in any way. Robert Lindner's earlier book, titled ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" a book-length study of a ""criminal psychopath,"" was not a source for the film either, except that the producers paid Lindner for their use of the title. Nonetheless, ""The Fifty-Minute Hour"" remains one of the most fascinating collections of psychological case histories written for a general audience--especially the final case history, ""The Jet-Propelled Couch,"" especially recommended to any science fiction fan."
4,Source of James Dean's brief shining hour,"I don't want to review this book so much as remind readers (or inform those who weren't born a month and 15 days after James Dean, as I wss), or potential readers, that a chapter with the same title was the source of the movie ""Rebel Without a Cause."" I read the book after seeing the movie the first time (when it came out), and remember it as enthralling."
2,the happiness makeover,"the shipping and shopping with amazon is fast and always good. However, the book is just ok. there is nothing new compared to other self help books. I like the book of Richard Carlson better."
2,"Okay, nothing earth-shattering here","This was yet another in a long line of ""happiness"" books that spew the same-old, same-old. Not worth the money, IMO."
3,A Mixed Bag of Wisdom and Corn,"I found this book hard to digest for a couple of reasons. First, the author begins by dismissing two factors strongly correlated with happiness: marriage and faith. This dismissal appears like pandering to be politically correct and it set me up to distrust further statements. I tried my best to be open-minded. Here's what I found: there is a lot of good, previously known wisdom (which is always worth repeating and re-contexting for a contemporary crowd), but also a lot of downright corn. Does anyone really engage in a gratitude circle, where you tell other people how important they are for you? I have my doubts that anyone actually follows through on this advice. There are good quotes from some well known authors an others not-so-known, but, again, it's mixed in with a lot of simplistic, pollyanish material. It's worth a read just for the gems mixed in with the stones."
4,electric grill,Although this grill is a little bigger that I would have liked it does a great job. I plan on taking it South for the winter for convenience. Great quality of material and workmanship.
5,Meco/Aussie Lock 'N Go Electric Grill,"Meco/Aussie Lock 'N Go Electric Grill, this is the best Grill I have ever owned heats up in minute I will never have to buy another propane cylinder or charcoal nor lighter fluid again great for camping or for the patio cooking . !"
2,Really want to like this...,"Well, the first test run with this little baby had me sold on electric grills, after years and years of charcoal (first) then propane (most recently). I loved the small footprint and the ease of use. However, the power supply unit has gone completely dodgy after only two grilling sessions, and I'm hoping Amazon can send us a new one that is more reliable. Otherwise, this will end up being a waste of money. Let's hope Amazon can make good on its ""excellent customer service"" promises."
5,nice grill,My first electric grill. Gets really hot and cooks well. I love this grill. Easy to clean.Just plug in and it's super hot in 10-15 min. Use it on my deck every week.
1,Sent it Back,"This came late and was damaged in shipment. I did not even use it once, so don't want to offer a review."
5,Worked better than expected,I purchased this grill because of the good reviews and because I want the outdoor grilling experience without messing with charcoal or gas. I tried out the grill for the first time tonight....salmon and grilled vegetables. Excellent results with the hickory chips added per the instructions. The grill heats up quickly and performs extremely well. I highly recommend this product.
3,electric grill,This was very cute but was not enough power. would not get hot enough and did not like the construction. hard to clean. I returned this.
4,"The Masterpiece - Jorn Utzon, A Secret Life","This is a great read for anyone interested in the story. Drew's research is absolutely thorough and his understanding of the complex issues surrounding the Sydney Opera House is impressive. The tendency is to slip into whimsical description of Utzon's buildings and his influences, and this slows the overall pace of the story, but it's not unexpected from an architecture critic. I'd recommend this to anyone. I was very disappointed, being a Sydney resident, that the only copy I could find anywhere in the world was second-hand in the UK - how could such an enjoyable and important book be out of print in Australia?"
3,jazzy? yes! dancy? i don't think so...,"i bought this one because i was searching for some jazzy dance oriented latin & brazilian music. i followed the recomendation but didn't quite get what i was expecting. most of the stuff here is pure ""hardcore"" jazz. upbeat? yes - but not meant for shaking your booty. i'm talking about jazz with avant - garde chords and improvisations. only tracks 1 & 10 are dance oriented. the rest is for listening. good for jazz fans but not if you're gonna throw a party. and the listening is not the sort of ""latin chillout"" you would expect..."
4,Great Item!!,Item was Great to Store extra items that did not fit in my Truck...Definitely helped during my move from New Jersey to Texas!!
5,Much needed,This extension was great. Definitely needed because without it the original rack would be tiny. No problem putting it together.
5,The Trickster,"A female Emril meets Davidcopperfield with a little help from an ancient God ! This book is wonderful! If you love mythology and if you love a good romance, this is the book for you It cleverly mixes a many times retold myth with the world of today. Kathleen Nance is a wondeful writer with a gift for making people laugh and smile as they read her book. This book is a keeper. I am eagerly awaiting the next installment of this series."
3,slight disappointment,"I found this album somewhat of a disappointment. Since I am not a die-hard fan I find myself skipping over many songs that I have not heard to get to the ""gems"". I probably would actually be happier with a stripped down version of this cd that included a few of his later hits."
4,still burning at the end,"Although Lenny was near the end when this performance was filmed, he still puts on a riveting show. He does go on about the legal system a lot but what he says makes so much sense. You almost wish he could have used something like this in some of his courtroom defenses. He always said the prosecutors would do a ""bad"" Lenny Bruce in court! For people who assume he was constantly harrased and busted for his foul language, get a hold of this film and see how brilliant he was."
3,a vision of a genius past his prime,"While it is great to see Lenny Bruce at work in The Lenny Bruce Performance Film, it arouses deeply mixed feelings in the hearts of those who are familiar with his earlier work. The legal system had ruined him financially and his own bitterness was days away from finishing him as well. In the film we can see glimers of his earlier genius, presented for a small San Francisco club when years earlier he sold out a midnight show at Carnagie Hall (he had played to a packed house when there was a blizzard raging outside, no less). But this video is of interest to those getting to know Lenny because we get to hear his side of his legal problems first hand, and to older fans because we can see where he was right before his end. So check it out, but remember that he wasn't always that good. He used to be better."
4,AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF HUMOR --- AND HISTORY,"George Carlin says it best: Bruce's genius' was the unique ability to investigate hypocrisy and expose social inequities in a street rap that was really a form of poetry. In this--- the only complete stand-up performance of Bruce ever captured on film --- the iconoclast poet speaks. Loudly. Filmed in 1965 at San Francisco's Basin Street West (in what would be his penultimate live appearance), the show consists of Bruce's responses to the accusations and allegations stemming from his multiple arrests for obscenity and the trials that followed. While the production values are far from superior, it is an important piece of history for humorists and historians to embrace."
3,A Historical Document,"The sound and picture quality of the tape make it difficult to keep up with Lenny's rapid-fire delivery. I took from this movie a sense of Lenny's style and mannerisms, but had difficulty feeling ""part of the audience."" To be sure, Lenny's brilliance and desperation are on full display, but the routine is less comedic and more a polemical declaration of free speech. I rather think that How to Talk Dirty and Influence People gave me a much clearer view of Mr. Bruce's philosophies, insights, and style than did seeing him on this tape."
3,"Clumpy, but must be doing SOMETHING!","My three year old autistic son is a very picky eater, but grows taller and very slim. He's energetic, and I m concerned about a lack of sufficient nutrients and small veggie intake with all that activity. Poor vision runs in our family and I don't want that possibility to be exacerbated. Well, he barely eats the gummies and mixing fruity vitamin he can taste is out! He has bionic taste buds and will actually EXAMINE the color of the liquid before drinking. If it isn't familiar, you can forget it. I mix this powder with almond milk (he likes a m) and he seems to have picked up his appetite and sleeps better. He is more vocal and seems to be forming clearer words. Still not putting on weight, but he grows taller. Only thing I don't like is that the powder clumps so bad. I have to shake it to death and even still, it clumps.."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"THIS POWDERED MULTI-VITAMIN WORKS GREAT IN ALL DIFFERENT FOODS. MY SON HAS SERIOUS FOOD AVERSIONS AND I HIDE IT IN HIS OATMEAL AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IT. A LITTLE MORE THAN I WANT TO PAY, HOWEVER IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO FIND ""TASTE FREE"" VITAMINS THAT IS POWDERED. HAVE USED IS FOR A YEAR NOW."
5,"Complete, accurate and clear","I used this book as base for teaching of Environmental Technologies at university. It is really good, easy to follow and addresses the main aspects of environmental pollution control. The only aspect that it does not cover is soil pollution. One strong point: the figures, graphs, exercises are very good!"
5,Meet Katsu,"In the first two episodes of this volume, you find that Sanosuke meets up with an old friend from the past who really likes to blow stuff up, particularly the meiji government. These episodes tell a little bit about sano's past and ANOTHER fight between Kenshin and Sanosuke. Hmm, i wonder who would win, Kenshin + sword vs Sano - sword. Duh. anyways, the other episodes are basicaly filler episodes, but they are also good too. Since everything kenshin is good anyways. Well, i think that you should get it to add to your collection."
4,Bertha!,"That's what I had to name this colossus. She wasn't necessarily easy to work with though. For one thing, the Ultra X3 1000 watt power supply would not fit initially. I had to remove the 3 1/2"" cage from the rear of the case and do some additional minor mods to get the PS in. But overall, this case was very easy to work with. Another minor note if your planning on building a screamer, which is what I would expect if your buying a water cooler equiped case. I would highly recommend using the water cooling for an SLI arrangement (or whatever flavor of dual VGA) and use a TEC (Thermal Electric Cooling) for the CPU. The built in water cooling equipment will do the job either way but a little much for just the CPU. And even though they do hint that the system could handle both the CPU and Dual VGA, I wouldn't recommend it if you plan on OC'ing. The TEC cooler will give you sub room temps, and the H2O system will keep the twins in check. Good Luck!"
4,"Good, but with minor flaws.","Pros:1/ Lots of space2/ Good cost for having both LCS and Case (instead of purchasing separately)3/ Very adequate air circulation4/ Screwless assembly5/ Almost quiet operationCons:1/ Heavy2/ Screwless assembly is not always true(I have a USB PCI card that won't clip, my Creative X-fi controls on the drive bay won't clip as well)3/ Difficulty clipping my 8800 GTX card. I have to slice a portion of the clip in order for it lock)4/ It is difficult to install the power supply, specially the bigger ones like mine.5/ The top fan won't lock since my power supply is long.*The best thing about this product is better heat control and big space - this two compensated for all the bad stuff."
3,Turkish Traditional Music in a contemporary form,This is a beautiful CD but certainly not Turkish Music.I was confused by the title. All the songs from Azerbeijan. If you like Traditional Azerbeijan music this CD is great.
1,Not very useful,"Warning to any that wish to use this, it can only be used on Windows XP programs. Don't waste your money if you don't have any Windows XP computers. Also, most WI-fi Nintendo products don't require this any more, so it's really not worth it."
1,KNOCK OFF!,"These songs are NOT performed by the original artists.These songs are not the original recordings. If you want the original recordings, go to the original artists. This is a knock-off compilation CD.Signed, One of the artists."
1,A Huge Disappointment,Poorly done covers.The songs you want are by Bananas At Large and Da Yoopers.I did not look close enough to see that they were not on the bands on THIS album.
2,No where near the SLAM DUNK level,"Although this book is a funny read, the art is horrible. The impossiblility of the moves is one thing, but to have such horrible form when shooting is another. The artist obviously doesn't play bbasketball, or he just hasn't bothered to watch and see how it's really done. The plot is pretty well thought out, but it's very hard to tell characters apart just by the art. The only variables, it seems, are hair, eyebrows and slight differences in the eyes. Overall this comic is not worth it."
1,No Good,"This comic book has absolutely no resemblance to the game, and I was really disappointed to see the main character flapping his legs and in this way actually jumping higher. I wish that comic book writers would research their chosen topic and give a good representation of this game, and not just some old rubbish that only fools will appreciate. I give one star only for effort."
1,Foolish No More?,"Pastor Haggard gives sums of advice, lots of it sexual, to his readers regarding how to live on the straight and narrow pathway to heaven. Meanwhile it seems that he found his own path to heaven paved with meth and a male prostitute exposing his wife of many years to shame and humiliation not to mention exposure to AIDS.If Pastor Haggard is ""Foolish No More"" I wonder what standard he is qualifying his judgment by. I believe my spaniel has more sense than to contact a common male prostitute and expose his family to potential disease and death from AIDS."
3,"Not a 72"" net","I typed in that I was looking for a 72"" net and this popped up without any description stating otherwise. Product is fine otherwise, but for those of you wanting/needing 72"" net don't be fooled."
2,net is shorter than standard,The Stiga Bart outs shorter than the standard table tennis net. It is about the same width as the table itself. Most nets are wider. As a result out did not fit. The length of the net should be listed in the description
5,amazing!,"I read these stories while at sea on a British research vessel. If you've ever been to sea, or have ever wanted to, you'll probably enjoy reading this trilogy. Nordhoff and Hall write in plain, unelaborate English, so the phrasing never gets in the way, and you can concentrate on all the colorful characters and incredible events. The first two (and half of the third) books are written in first person, putting you right into the action and events, making you think about what you would do in the situations as they arise.This trilogy has it all: adventure, drama, comedy, history, life at sea, love and loss. It's hard to believe this all really happened. I've given this book to two of my friends already, and they both liked it. You'll probably like it, too."
5,Great Book,"I read this book when I was in Jr. High School (required reading in one of my English Classes) and this was the book that really motivated me into recreational reading. After having to read some Dickens and Shakespear as well as some other ""Classic"" authors, I was not expecting a book like this. This was an adventure. Very exciting. Very suspensful. This is what reading is about. I purchased this book recently and relived the adventure after more than 25 years and found it hadn'd lost any of suspense. GREAT READING. Give it to a young reader and get them excited about reading. I don't understand why schools don't require more books like this to motivate kids to read instead of the reading assignments that keep Cliff Notes in business. Other authors that I like reading are James Clavell, Gary Jennings, Tom Clancy and Herman Wouk and this book fits in the same catagory of Historical Adventure."
2,"Tried, but couldn't get into it","Tried, but couldn't get into it, even though I was in Tahiti!Really? 8 more words required in order post this?"
2,Half fiction,"The first book is basically half fiction which distorts the real William Bligh.In reality Bligh was not a complete monster. A more balanced look into the causes of the Mutiny will be found in Richard Hough's Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian. This book is the basis of the Hopkins/ Gibson Movie. The other movies are based on the Nordoff/Hall writings. The second book of the trilogy seems to be an accurate description of the open boat journey which Bligh and the non-muntineers endured. This book seems based on Bligh's written account. The third book of the trilogy is loosely based on what happened to Flecther Christian and his fellow mutineers after they settled on Pitcairn Island. Little historical fact is actually known about the fate of the mutineers.Thus, this part of the trilogy is, almost out of neccesity, complete speculation. But it is interesting reading"
2,LETS GET HIGH...AND FALL ASLEEP!,"I am a huge LOA fan...but honestly this single and its repetitive remixes are just plain BORING! Tracks 3, 4, and 5 all sound exactly the same...come on LORDS you can do better:("
4,Carl Sandburg,"Purchased from Amazon and as always, the transaction was very satisfactory. Highly recommend this book. It was very easy reading, amusing, informational, and for someone from Illinois, especially Galesburg, Illinois, it brings back many memories."
2,A Bore Fest....,"Forget the gurus, her grandmother deserves all the praise for finally suggesting she was wasting her time in the monastery.A drab 10 years wasted there. Read more about her life at spiritual-happiness."
5,Read the translations and make your own interpretations,"Unlike the many books on bushido I have bought, this is a collection of short writings translated with no interpretation, other than an introduction. There are no great descriptions of great battles fought. The passages tend toward the more mundane business of being a feudal lord. Several are 'last statements' which gives you insight as to what the Samurai really wanted to be remembered for. And you will remember the quotable word bites. There are several B&W reproductions of paintings of the authors."
4,A living Samurai spirit,This wonderful book is a prove that spirit has its reserved place on world history and in the mind of whose want to live a honrable live code. Not a mere historical report but a sensive demonstration of respect by a life-style
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I'm a big comedy fan and if it's not funny then I know and this isn't funny. The jokes are corney and lame. Just don't buy or rent this movie, trust me!"
3,Intersting observations for the hard physics,"I really enjoyed the observations of professor Bailin about gauge theory, which is quite useful in the field of submoleculer physics and wave theory. However, his writing is quite scientific, which is to be expected in this type of field, but if particle physics floats your boat, then this would be a good book to buy."
2,The Warner Remastered Edition is the only one to get,"Amazon lists some 30-odd different releases of Till the Clouds Roll By, but the newly remastered edition from Warner Home Video (ASIN: B000EBD9SA) is the only version worth buying. The cliche that you get what you pay for is definitely true in this case; all other editions available, including this one, are ripped from public domain prints of the film, with greatly varying quality in both video and audio.As other reviewers have pointed out, the 'biopic' story is one of the hokiest that Hollywood ever committed to screen, bearing little resemblance to the life of the real Jerome Kern -- but the great songs just keep coming, and coming.And the Warner remaster is filled with important extras that you won't want to miss."
4,Kern Bio-Pic Offers Big-Time Musical Moments,"Forget the Hollywood-ized pseudo-biography of composer Jerome Kern and simply sit back, relax, and enjoy one stunning musical production number after another, featuring the likes of Lena Horne, Angela Landsbury, Judy Garland, and Lucille Bremer."
2,Cult classic,"To be blunt, this is the worst musical MGM ever released. The script is extraordinarily weak; try counting the cliches. The casting was poor. And only a few of the star-studded musical numbers are successful. Tony Martin, Dinah Shore, Lena Horne, and Frank Sinatra were all at their peak of their vocal powers, of course, and they do well. Judy Garland's numbers are acceptable, although you can tell that she was starting to come unglued. But beyond that, all is embarrassment. And nothing is believable. Indeed, this film should be a cult classic, shown at midnight with the audience throwing things at the screen during particularly awful melodramatic moments and dancing in the aisles during the June Allyson numbers. Torture can be fun."
3,Judy is the Only Reason to Watch the Film,The film is a major bore except when Judy plays her role. Look for the Silver Lining is one of Judy's best performances and who would have guess that Judy was pregnant with Liza while she was singing and dancing it up with the big production number Who. Just shows that Judy can do anything.
1,Doesn't work on my computer,"I tried this download when the Unbox promotions started. I couldn't get it to play. I think my computer is just not powerful enough. I had a 1 gig MHz business machine with a lousy video card. I've recently swapped computers here in my living room and have not tried it again. I'd have to download the Unbox software again. If you don't have at least a 2 gig MHz machine with a great Video Card, I wouldn't bother with Unbox if I were you. Fun Idea, but only for the more advanced computer folks out there. Now I keep getting download advertisements in e-mail from Amazon. Sure wish I could shut them off somehow..."
2,Ooops,"This is a tasteless and vulgar bio of Jerome Kern. Only the sequences directed by Vincente Minnelli ignite any kind of fire. The music is great, but NOT here... Any STYLE is missing!!!!!!!!!!! The only pleasable moments come from Dinah Shore, Judy and Frank Sinatra."
4,Till the Clouds Roll by.,"The movie was something that MGM was very good at doing during its heyday. It made good musicals. This was one of their best. The songs are ones that a lot of us know, like ""Old Man River."" Anyone who likes musicals will like this one. The title mentions Frank Sinatra collection, but he is in the movie only a short time."
2,Good movie - Bad DVD Transfer,"While this film may not have the most exciting plot, one cannot deny the great production values of the musical numbers thanks to the Arthur Freed Unit. Judy Garland's numbers are top notch, along with the rest of them. Unfortunately, this film must have slipped into public domain, and the company who picked up the rights to doing a DVD print are not sticklers for quality! Since Warner Brothers now has the MGM library, if the DVD doesn't say Warner Home Video on it, you may want to get the VHS version instead. :-) Hopefully, sometime in the future, Warner Brothers will get the rights back to do a DVD, and get it done in nice crystal clear mastering. Then I can go out and re-buy it. Arther Freed musicals are a ""must have"" on DVD!"
2,Disappointed,"A year or so ago, I ordered the $4.95 version of ""Till the Clouds Roll By"". After putting it in my DVD player, I soon realized why the cost was so low. The picture was TERRIBLE. Two weeks ago, I decided to try again and purchased the most expensive of the DVDs offered - this one for $14.95. I read the info before purchasing and saw that it was supposedly remastered. Imagine my disappointment when I turned on the DVD player once more and found essentially the same lousy picture. I enjoyed the film when I saw it on AMC and really wanted a good copy of it. Apparently one doesn't exist - at least through Amazon."
4,Very Good for History,"Happy The Man is one of the last American 1970's art rock groups. kit Watkins is an amazing player. This recording features a vocalist that is much better than any of the singers occurring on later LP's. I am impressed with this record, being that it can from mid seventies technology and done out of the home. David Rosenthal (Rainbow, Steve Vai) has a lot to do with getting this record released and I am glad he did. You can hear some new sounds and many familiar HTM chord progressions. Great spin!"
1,Poor quality,"These foam balls are nowhere near the quality I expected. The foam is cheap and sheds small particles rather easily. It also doesn't rebound the way a foam ball should. If you're looking for a good quality foam ball, look elsewhere."
3,A really awesome song,Fomer New Kid Joey Mcintyre has a really cool new song ''Stay the same.'' is soooo cool it's not even funny.The songs really cool so much that I can't wait 4 the cd to come out.I'm soo excited And u will be to when you hear ''Stay The Same'' by Joey Mcintye.
1,He USED to be able to sing,"I remember I was around 5 or 6 when New Kids On the Block came out, and although I wasn't really a fan of them then, I remember Joey popping up at the end of ""Please Don't Go Girl"" in 1988, and everyone knew he had skills, although I don't remember hearing his vocals anytime since then. But I don't know where his skills went.By listening to this song, you'd think he's never taken a voice lesson in his life. When he's not saying ""And I hope you'll always stay the same"" in bad falsetto, he's trying to rely on a choir to hide his other bad vocals (remember during the bridge when he kept saying ""Believe in yourself""?)."
3,single,"i bought the single for ""stay the same"" now that i have it, that song annoyes the hell out of me. but that's probably because i've listened to it too much. the excerpts from his cd, i think are a good representation. there are some upbeat tunes and some slower sultry ones. i think if ""stay the same"" appeals, then the cd as a whole you'll probably like too. yeah. it's okay."
5,"He should stay the same, he's a new kid.","Joe McIntyre's first single ""Stay the Same"" is a very heart wrenching tune with a good message. He has come back into the business with a boom and will obviously be very successful."
5,comment of Stay The Same,"This album's content is very good. Becouse This album includes verious love stories.Also ""Stay the same""suits to Joe's love song. Anyway I always enjoy it."
5,Joe Mcintyre is an inspriration,"I was able to get Joe's Stay The Same single through Columbia and it's the greatest song to come out in years. The song is such an inspiration, you feel you can do anything when listening to it. As far as his other songs on his solo CD they are just as amazing. Joe writes and sings his songs from the heart which make them even more special. It's great to see Joe back and we all know he will be the next Frank. JOE YOU'RE THE BEST!!!"
2,Toning up is not as easy as you think,"I was looking for some help to get myself toned up and thought this video would do the trick. It made me realize that I am very out of shape. I could not keep up with the video & was very sore the next day. I guess I was expecting something that was not so harsh. I'm not saying the video is not good, I just think people who are considering purchasing this should realize it is not for people just beginning to exercise."
3,"Maybe they should've named it, ""Look Out!""","I wake up.I take a shower.I use soap.I eat breakfast.Without the newspaper.I go to class.I power on the DVD player.I watch this DVD.It's pretty preposterous but fairly decent.If you can't suspend your disbelief.You'd have to be brain-damaged to think that this scheme would work.I think I gave it three stars, but I need to check my notebook.I wake up ...."
3,"SCOTT FRANK, OPUS 1","*** 2007. Written and directed by Scott Frank. A student who had a terrible car accident four years before, suffers from loss of memory. A gang wants to use him when its members learn that he works in a bank as night watch. Original script but average result if we except the mood of the film. In fact, the director uses only a few sets - the apartment, the bank, the house, the bar - for his characters who otherwise seem to wander through a ghost town, as if they were only characters of the hero's memory. A DVD zone rental only."
3,The Lookout,I have been buying movies on Blu-Ray to take advantage of 1080p. This particular title looked interesting but turned out to be a little dull.
2,boring...didn't seem to be getting anywhere,I rented this movie because it had good reviews and the trailer seemed not bad. I watched for about half-hour and it didn't seem to be getting anywhere. Eventually I just got bored and decided not to watch.
2,bargain bin bound,"The only thing that happens in the first 45 minutes is that you learn to dislike everyone in the film. Jeff Daniels chooses to play Jeff Bridges' Dude character from Big Lebowski. That in itself is amusing for a few minutes. There is no ""twist"" at the end. I'd say its more of a thunk."
4,Look out for Gordon-Levitt in The Lookout,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding in his role of a mentally disabled local hero (Chris Pratt), alongside a blind Jeff Daniels (Lewis), who would probably steal the show if he were given just a bit more screen time. Some of the characters were not developed as much as they could have been, and this can leave you wondering what happened to them. Where did Luvlee Lemons run off to? Where did the mysterious Bone come from?Don't expect an intense thriller or an hour and a half of bank robbery suspense, because that's only half the story here. The first half shows us Chris Pratt's accident and his life thereafter, and Lewis bringing a flavor of comedy relief. The second half presents a group of thugs, with Matthew Goode (Gary) as their dark ringleader, taking advantage of Chris Pratt by using him in their bank heist scheme."
3,It was alright,"Not what I expected, could of been way better! But it was a good price and not that bad of a movie."
5,mesmerizing..,"Honestly said I bought the dvd because of Matthew Goode and Joseph Gordon Levitt mesh up at first, but after watching it, I was blew away, kudos to the writer and director to make my brain melts and my heart breaks. I really love the ending of this movie.. if you want to feel what it's like for being a real ordinary human being in the movie this is the best movie to experience it."
3,"Good movie, good performances, but that's it.","Good movie, good performances, but that's it. Nothing spectacular here, except the blu-ray picture. Probably would have given 3.5 if I could though. Certainly not a waste of an evening, but not nearly as suspenceful or twisting as it is advertised. Quiet and not over-played. Just good, not great. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave a surprisingly good performance and now that he's filled out some he looks earily like Heath Ledger!"
1,Don't buy this one,"Don't buy this one, maybe this one cheap priceBut Aspect Ratio only have 1.66:1, Studio: Echo Bridge.Buy the original one Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1. Studio: Miramax."
4,Impressive first feature. Recommended.,"I would definitely recommend this film to those who're into intelligent 'crime' thrillers.Sure there are certain elements within the screenplay that remind us of Nolan's ""Memento"", but that's where the comparison's end. ""The Lookout"" is shot and edited in a totally different fashion, with confident direction from Scott Frank which gives the film its own style and voice.In my mind, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quickly becoming one of the more consistent & talented actors of his generation. You have to hand it to him, he has chosen his post-TV roles wisely, (it's clear he has a solid agent working for him).Jeff Daniels delivers one of his most interesting performances to date; the guy owns it whenever he's on screen here."
