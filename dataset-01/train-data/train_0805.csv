2,not for dogs who love to chew,"After reading the reviews I thought this would be perfect for my new rescue dog who seems to chew more than our other dog. It wasn't. The head and tail were chewed to bits in probably less than 10 minutes. My dog is a Sheltie, probably German Shepherd mix so we aren't talking mega-jaws here. I gave the extra star because it is cute but did not have the durability that I expected from Kong toys."
3,"Cute toy, but ripped open in a day","To be fair our dog rips through most toys, I had just hoped this one would be an exception. Oddly, although the body is ripped open at the end, the head is still in tact.Despite being torn open, there wasn't much of a mess, and she still plays with it. She even brought it outside to the back yard, typically for things she really likes and doesn't want to share. :-) It went through the rain and then the washer and dryer and is still fine."
4,Big Snake,"Dog wasn't a huge fan of the snake. Not sure why, but it's an average stuffed animal, don't really know why it's a Kong product, but whatever"
5,Understanding,"Every History teacher in our world should read this book. It certainly cleared up a lot of questions I had regarding why our world is presently like it is. It would be helpful to update our children's historical education.Most importantly, historical facts are being proven true by scientic data and modern technology.5000 years of Dominator/Submissive behavior has taken its toll on sociey and the Earth...this reading will help you define it in your own life."
1,So muddleheaded; so downright stupid,"Long suffering Ms Eisler is so far out that it is difficult to believe that many people actually take her seriously. Yes, her so-called work is a ""hit"" so to speak. It is frightening that such preposterous claims such as the following on page xxiii; ""the story of how the original partnership direction of Western culture veered off into a bloody five-thousand-year dominator detour."" It just veered off, eh? Yup, it just ""veered off."" Yabut, it is veering back again. Marija Gimbutas calls this science. It is worse than wrong."
4,"great,but something just doesnt sound right","i really cant grasp the concept that being in a matrichial society makes everything honky dory and that patrichial society messes everything up,what we need is a society of balance. i really enjoyed reading this book,but it seemed to antimale to me."
2,very disappointed,"I ordered the book at the beginning of February. To this day, I have not received it, however, a credit was issued for what I paid. I will hesitate to order anything else from them."
4,"Not Perfect, But Important to Read","This book, in many ways, changed the way I thought. It raises awareness to the fact that there were goddess worshiping, female oriented societies in Neolithic times. It examines these societies and compares them to the warring, male-dominated cultures that eventually took over. In the book, some of the interpretation of the archeological evidence is speculative, but usually only in regards to the meaning of the symbols used in those cultures, and when this type of speculation occurs, it is easy to spot so you can judge for yourself. In regards to larger issues about the structure of those ancient cultures, the conclusions drawn based on the archeological remains are more concrete and obvious. This book is an easy and enjoyable read, and opens your mind to how things might change as we swing back towards being in balance with the feminine aspect."
3,"faulty, but true anyway","I must agree with the other reviewers that Eisler's analysis of prehistory, (and her speculations about the as yet future in the final chapter) must be taken with a grain of salt. However her analysis of more recent history and of the present is superb and right on target, our only hope for the future.A more helpful book might be The Creation of Patriarchy, by Gerda Lerner. Lerner is a true historian, whose thesis that male domination serves as the prototype for all human domination, is the same as Eislers, however her historical research is much more realistic and less utopian."
5,life changing,"I originally read this book several years ago and it transformed my view of the world. It woke me up to the idea that the chaos and brutality of the present world haven't always existed, and did not have to exist. The evidence that Eisler presents for the existence of prehistoric partnership societies is compelling. The only possible area where the book isn't so convincing is its search for the causes of patriarchy and violence. Steve Taylor's recent book The Fall goes very deeply into the psychological roots of these problems andThe Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Erapresents a very inspiring view of the human race's possible future."
1,NEAR EXPIRATION,I just purchased this item to include in a 1st Aid kit for my sister. I am a medical professional and wanted the most complete kit I could put together. I received this item in Nov 2012 and it has an expiration of March 2013. 4 months for a medication intended for a child that unless your child has a tummy ache today... I'd pass on this one. I feel that this information should have been disclosed in the sale as some people may not be bothered by a near expiration date. But for what I paid in purchase cost PLUS shipping... I could have purchased it new at a store. Unfortunately I live an hour from the nearest town that sells items like this which is why I refer to Amazon.
4,A friendly book,It is an easy readable book to revisit simple questions of logic. I would recomend it to someone who wants to think about logic in a light and funny way.
3,"""I should have known""","I should have known, when looking on the internet,getting information on porsche unleashed,and finding nothing really spectacular on this title,that it was going to be a let down!first of all the game plays,pretty good,and the amount of cars are not that bad either it was just the fact that the visuals dont stack up against any of the other titles(like NFS High Stakes)I found this purchase to be fun for a little while,but in the end ""Porsche Unleashed""was just another game in my stack,that I show really no interest in!"
1,Sucks!,"This game is the worst game I have played and I will play! It does'nt worth 1c. Everything in it sucks (especially the cars).Here is a list of the good things:SORRY THERE ARE NO GOOD THINGSHere is a list of the bad things:1. Bad graphics2. Bad tracks3. Bad cars4. Old cars5. Your opponent are faster than you!SO DO NOT I, REPEAT DO NOT BUY OR ORDER THIS GAME!"
3,A bit disappointing!,"As a self confessed Porsche fanatic, I had to have this game as soon as it was released. The Porsche history and selection of cars is great, but the actual driving is disappointing. There is no ""feel"" to the cars. Also, not having a rear view mirror on the screen is a huge minus especially in the police chase games. The best driving game is still Gran Turismo 2. If you don't have that game yet, get it."
4,need for speed:porsche unleashed,"apt title for a game,suitable for all ages,espically the more mature gamer who would like to get behind a porsche,and 'feel the force'"
3,Porsche on a Leash...,"This should not be named anything like need for speed. Better would be ""Need for Brakes"". This has nothing to do with speed, but your ability to stop and corner around turns that are negative in degrees! what a waste.too bad, it should have been great.I have all other NFS and love 4 & 3. Back to # 3 to have fun and find some more jumps."
2,Not the same as the computer version!!,I was disappointed in the graphics and the gameplay was not the same as the computer version. The pc version is better.
5,"A Mod,Mod,Mod Movie!!","This mod,mod,mod 1968 movie has superb musical scores by the Beatles George Harrison.Also,Jef Films Inc. should aggressively pursue the never been video release of Pat Boone's many great movie musicals made during the 50's and 60's that might prove to be very profitable.I mean Elvis as great as he was should'nt get all the glory!!"
1,ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL !!! - wait for the CD music album,"I'm not really a George Harrison fan but I've always loved the amazing Wonderwall LP music, VERY Indan with disconcerting Western touches. I wondered what the movie must have been like. Well, the movie is VERY bad. It is boring!!. The lead character, an Einstein type peeks through a peephole at a 60's babe and gets unhinged as the sitars whine and the tablas thump. But not, alas for me. It is neither sexy or interesting or anything, though I must admit that Jack MacGowran (the scientist) followed the stupid script perfectly as did IaIn Quarrier, the loutish lover. Skip all this nonsense and get the exquisite Wonderwall album on CD when market conditions permit its eventual release for maximum profit, or tape someone's vinyl LP until then. Wonderful music!"
2,You have to be very forgiving....,"...if you're going to get any pleasure out of this movie. Forgiving of a script and a plot that function mainly as a excuse to show off Jane Birkin's ample features to maximum effect. Forgiving of camerawork with a lens that was apparently smeared with Vaseline throughout each take and sound recording which defies every attempt to make the dialogue understandable (probably a good thing!). Otherwise, you might just as well get a copy of George Harrison's interesting music for this movie (if you can find it) and save yourself the ordeal of sitting through the movie itself. You'll be happier, trust me!"
2,Why is this rated teen,"ok first off fighting monkeys and robots sucks.... this doesnt even come close to any zelda game by far.ok with that off my chest ill give you the good and the bad first the good, graphics:8 battle sytem:9 controls awkward at first because of the camera thing but its cool:7.5 now the bad plot:3 enemies,they're robots,monkies and stupid little gremlin things that should be in a dr. suess book c'mon :2 so i played about a half hour than turned it off in disgust maybe good for little kids with some parents help.so... stay away from this game"
2,too many annoying puzzles,"alundra 2 is a weak game because of the lousy camera angle. i hate it when i cannot see were em i going because of an object blocking my view. and i also hate those annoying puzzles that when u mess up u have too start all over again. and those minigames, my god u have too have superhuman speed and patience just too accomplish them. and they all cost a bundle, apparently like in the real world money those not come easy in alundra 2. sidequesting also is barely original. even that shining sword whos still weak at the enemy. barely impressive. storyline is a bit edgy, meet the princess meet the bad guy save the princess from the bad guy, same old same old. one thing i like though, sometimes the characters make u giggle. but thats it, and i also like ""the shooter"" minigame."
2,The ugliest game I've ever seen,"The graphics are now 3-D and terrible! They should have kept it 2-D. It's even worse than Grandia, but Grandia had many great qualities this title lacks."
2,Meh...,In a few words its just boring and to difficult. Nothing like the orginal and just not fun. I understand its a PSX game and should be more forgiving but I still think I would feel the same even if I played this in 2000.
2,Disapointing.,"I was so excited when I found this game in the used game bin at the Game Store the other day. I was a HUGE fan of the first one and was excited to see a sequel. Well after playing for one day I am sorry that I ever found it at all. The animation is choppy (even for its time. They should have never moved to 3D from 2D. I have no idea why this is even a sequel - there is no mention of the first one. The only simialrity is hacking the bushes for money. There are WAY to many cut scenes and while the voice acting is good, the scenes themselves are not well drawn. And they take place every few minutes. Fight a monster - get a cut. Walk into a room, get a cut.The first boss is WAY to hard for a first battle, there are far to few saved spots. I am only a few hours into the game, so it could get better, but based on the other reviews here I am not optimistic."
4,This Games Da Bomb!,This is one of the best RPG games I've played since Zelda 64! My N64 broke from over-playeg so I got PSX. It was great to find a game like Zelda for the Playstation but the strategy guide isn't the greatest. I recomend using an online walkthru or the Expert Gamer walkthru. Over-all this game rocks but the graphics could be better.....
3,Fun Start &#65533; Then It Gets Old Quick,"I was really excited when I first got this game. It was fun and I looked forward to playing it. But then about 1/2 - 3/4's of the way in I got really tired trying to figure out some of the secrets of the rooms and even when I did it became more about becoming master of my controller-pushing the right buttons in the cleanest, fastest way so that I could actually jump, leap or hit my way correctly into the next sequence....YAWN..., not to mention tedious...It's one thing to be smart enough to figure out *how* to more on and it's another thing entirely when you know what you need to do and can't quite physically pull it off and have to keep trying...and trying...and trying...to get it done 'cause ya ain't go no choice! BLAH!"
5,The best action/rpg since Zelda 64,"Alundra 2 is a great game. There are not enough action/rpgs out there. It has an excellent system of magic and sword combos. The puzzles are not too easy but they are not as difficult as they are in Alundra either. The story is not as good as Alundra's, and it has nothing to do with its story . that does not make the story horrible though. It has a lot of hummor in it. If you like action/rpgs then chances are you will like Alundra 2. It has solid gameplay and a hummorous story. The voice overs are also a plus that is missing from many games."
3,Sugar Ray Leonard and Gary Daniels in Martial Arts Mayham!!,"Riot was a good movie, a little thin on plot, but Gary Daniels as always delivers some increadable Martial Arts action. Suger Ray Leonard was also in the flick and the Bar fight with the two was phenominal. Definatley a movie to watch if you like marital arts."
2,"Beware, they work, but they are made from cheap materials...","I bought a pair of these about two years ago. During use at work and flying they worked great. They even include an airplane headphone jack adapter.However, the ear enclosures are hinged so they can flip and fold into the head band, and fit into an included vinyl bag for storage. After approximately one year of use the plastic hinges became brittle and broke off one of the ear enclosures making the headset useless.Beware, you get what you pay for."
2,Made me a little more anxious,"I've recently starting practicing meditation on a daily basis and have found it hugely helpful in reducing my tendency toward anxiety and depression. It is nice to have a fresh, new meditation after a few months. I don't know why, but the few times I've listened to it, I find my anxiety suddenly increased during the guided meditations. In one meditation, he instructs you to ""invite your foot to relax-- ...notice the intelligence your foot...notice the intelligence in your ankles...in your legs.... It just was too weird for me. I like Dr. Rossman's voice and the way he allows silent moments amidst his talking. I sometimes find music in the background distracting, and, while I haven't listened to all the tracks, there is no music in the ones I have heard."
5,great overview of a fantastic band,DONOTS are one of the most famous punkrock-bands in Europe and on the road for more than 13 years now already. This record includes not only all their hits of the last 4 records but also all B-sides - which for me are even more interesting.This record is a perfect start to get to know DONOTS as well as a great fan-item to those being interested in the band's b-sides.
1,Question about the game,I would like to know if this game works on PS2..I want to buy but unsure if thisd game would work.?? thanks Tim at walesrage@hotmail.com
4,And he fires the thingamabob into the whatchamacalit!,"Well worth the time for any hockey fans, this game owes more to the original Open Ice 2-on-2 game than Blitz, but who cares, it's still great. The commentary is hilarious, the guy's a genius and hes just as good in NHL 2002. The action is fast but you can still control it, fights are great, you should really get this game just to see your goalies go at it! Go buy it, you'll have a blast and won't regret it."
1,Buy a real hockey game and WWF instead.,"NHL Rock the Rink is entertaining for the first five minutes like NFL Blitz. However, once you realize that it has little to do about hockey gameplay and more about trying to be like WWF Smackdown in a hockey rink that's when you'll stop playing. The last complaint about this game is that you are unable to play as any of the NHL teams (so why even should it garner the NHL prefix?) Instead, you play as a fantasy team against you NHL favorites. Do yourself a favor, if you are a true hockey fan stick with either 989 Sports excellent Faceoff series or EA Sports hockey offerings."
2,Don't bother,"SHORT cord cannot be replaced, so don't bother with this phone unless you can sit RIGHT by it to chat."
1,Trashcan,This phone has a short and non-replaceble handset cord. It has a short and non-replaceable line cord. It lasted less than a day.Line cord was damaged after purchase. It went into the trash.
1,"Just say ""No!""",Permanantly attached really short handset cord and batteries to make caller id work. What where they thinking?What was I thinking? I can't believe I bought something before user comments were posted. I figured I couldn't be dissatisfied with a basic corded phone. I was wrong.
1,Crappy product + HARD-WIRED phone cords,"I bought this cheap phone b/c it was cheap + had caller ID. I have since had to buy a hands-free headset that needs to plug INTO a corded phone to use. So now I have to buy another phone in order to (comfortably) attend teleconference meetings that can last an hour or more. What a waste.I am also afraid that other single-line phones will be hard-wired now, too, and it is so hard to tell from photos.Update: the caller ID function is now broken! When I scroll and choose a name to dial, the phone randomly chooses a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT number to dial, even though the number shown in the screen is the one I WANT to call!"
2,ge slimline phone w/ caller id,"this phone is great unless you'd like to add a longer cord to move around your kitchen at all, the cord is permanently attached at the phone base so that's not an option."
2,could have been fine...,"I was quite satisfied with this, even though the cords are non-replaceable and the display is not lighted, until I discovered that the batteries (4xAA) even alkalines only last a couple of months, actually about 45 days, and when they die, the phone goes dead too. That's not acceptable, and it makes for a very expensive phone in the long run, if you figure at least 8 sets of batteries per year. I'm returning both that I bought."
2,short cord isn't replacable,"Phone was everything I wanted for kitchen phone... caller ID and keypad in the handset, small, wall mountable.... but I need a long cord to be able to matriculate around the kitchen. I can't believe the cord isn't replaceable!!! Who would have though?"
1,"Twisted, irreplaceable handset cord!","I have this phone in my office near the computer since I wanted a nice corded phone that would be operable when/if the power went out and would not cause interference with the other electronics located near it. Unfortunately, the handset cord has become mangled and twisted and is nearly impossible to detangle. I thought the natural solution would be to replace the handset cord with a Twisstop telephone cord with detangler. So, after spending about $14 on the cord and detangler, I go to put it on and discover that YOU CANNOT REMOVE THE HANDSET CORD FROM THE BASE OF THE PHONE! So, my new cord is as useless as this phone. On a positive note, I've had no issues with the caller id or function of the actual phone unit, but the untameable, irreplaceable cord is inexcusable."
4,You've got to love these guys,"I think in order to truly enjoy this album, you've got to listen to it with a sense of humor. The synths are cheezy, the covers are kitsch and corny, and pervading all of it is this strange... gothic... electronic... choral... anthem sound. The songs are stirring and driving, but oddly contrasted with extremely serious and croaky vocals heavily laden with a strong Slavic accent. But these are all selling points! I love this album, for all of its schmaltzy apocalyptic drama!Be warned, many (if not all?) of these songs are covers--usually clever covers at that."
4,Brilliant Industrial interpretations of classics,"Laibach in NATAO demonstrates an uncanny ability to take a classic piece of music, whether it be Holst's Mars, or the classic 70's protest song ""Cherokee Nation"", and twists it into a contemporary, meaningful, driving and relevant piece of music. I love their knack for transition."
3,50-50 funny and not-funny,"I agree with the editorial reviewer who said this compilation is uneven. Some of these pieces are just plain *not funny* -- bland humor, worn jokes. But some of the pieces ARE funny -- with some gay-specific humor (which isn't to say only gay people get it, just that it's topical) and some more general humorous looks at life. On balance I'd say it's about 50-50 funny and not. It's something you can skim through and get a few laughs out of in the course of a day. The flat-out essays work best; the scripts of stand-up shticks and performance art don't translate well to the page."
3,Different from the TV series,"The first thing we saw right away was that there is no one in the background laughing when there are funny bits, it was kinda odd to have to ""find"" the funny moments and do all the laughing yourself..LOLIt was still a nice movie with the know people we love from the series, but in a way it seemed like they were working hard to make the move flow with any ease. It was a good try from the Are You Being Served Series. Its too bad they did not try to make another one with more of a comedy feel with laughter and natural feeling moments."
4,I saw it multiple times and it got better...,"Originally I found the AYBS movie a bit weak. Many of the jokes are repeated from the episodes, and the store looks different. Also, the plot is a little far-fetched. However, after viewing it several times (thanks to occasional boring Ohio winter days), I came to appreciate it much more. In fact I was laughing hysterically after watching it the third time.The original cast is there, plus a few extras. The holiday to Spain idea is pretty creative, since we always hear the cast talk about holidays on the show. Certain jokes are new, and they are rather funny. Even if the movie doesn't strike you as original, or even funny, owning the movie is essential for any AYBS fan. Its like owning a piece of history, since the series only ran for 69 episodes."
2,Rent first before you buy!,"This movie was so disappointing... The lighting, and the loss of the laugh track... Are You Being Served? is a loud show, the laugh track keeps the feeling of tension and fun going.. they try to replace it with some awful carnival music, but it just doesn't work. If I had money and a time machine, I would go back in time and fix the lighting, the sets, and either put in a laugh track, or film this live. I still love the show and I don't know why they didn't pay attention to the lighting or sound... It is a tragedy! The lines are good but you will need a creative imagnination to make this film work!"
1,A big disappointment,"I own the ""Are You Being Served"" DVD mega box set which is great from beginning to end. So I bought the movie thinking it would meet the same high standards. Boy, was I wrong. It's nothing more than a rehash of old skits from the TV series, and badly done at that. The sets look very cheap, the acting is tired, the director offers no direction. In other words, it was very boring with hardly a laugh anywhere. If I were the creators of this classic Britcom, I would have been ashamed to have pawned this ""take the money and run"" movie off on the public. But don't let this movie tarnish your view of ""Are You Being Served,"" the series. It's still the best of the best. Buy the TV episodes and you won't be disappointed."
2,Terrible,"The worst of the original TV series (which is classic) is ten times better than this tired, uninspired junk. Do not bother with it.Gone is the department store, the clever dialogue, the laugh track (yes sometimes this is needed), and a sense of direction.It is silly without being funny. A tremendous opportunity utterly lost.Buy the complete series DVDs instead."
1,don't bother,"If you're a true fan of AYBS, then you've seen all if not most of the episodes. All the humor in this movie is taken right from the series. The same jokes. Nothing new here."
3,Should you buy it?,"I'm a big ""BritCom"" fan, and also own the series. Yes, it's true the series is much better than this movie. As has been stated previously, there really isn't a lot of new material here: it's truly a stitching together of a new script from patches of dialogue from the series. So if you think you've heard the joke before, you have.However, that being said, many people can't afford the price of the series (although thankfully, I noticed that it's been on sale for half of the original asking price). If for some reason, you love AYBS but can't fork out the money for the series, this isn't a bad way to get a taste of it. That's what I did, and although I hardly ever watch this movie anymore (I'd much rather pop in one from the TV series), it can satisfy your AYBS cravings temporarily."
4,Are You Being Served? The Movie,"A movie based on the hit television show. In order to fully appreciate and understand the film, it helps if you have seen at least a few episodes of the show and understand the characters. The movie has humorous moments but sometimes tries a tad too hard. The tv series is better but it's worth seeing especially if you are a fan of the show."
3,disk quality poor story line so so but still fun,"This new disk was rather poor quality, sticking and stuttering first time played.The story line was rather lame, but the chance to see old friends from Grace Brothers was fun. Always enjoy the company of players we have come to know and love. I wish the writers and production values had done better for this wonderful troupe of actors."
1,No Wonder 'Captain Peacock' is Looking Down!,"I was referring to the jacket cover of the DVD.As a die-hard fan of ""Are You Being Served?"", the moment I began watching the film I knew it was a BOMB. Many familiar storylines from the 'AYBS' series are interwoven into the film but to no avail. Without the presence of a live audience, sharper dialogue...the movie is a disappointment."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this for my husband as he is a long time fan of the TV show but after he watched about 30 minutes of it, he gave up and added it to the things we were taking to Goodwill. Money wasted."
5,Brit Comedy Gold,If you like British Comedy or especially if you like Are You Being Served you will love this. Its great! It has all of their best episodes filled with the that witty humor that only certain people can underestand. If you have seen Are You Being Served and like it this is definatly worth buying. I watch it all the time! Its truly great that this fantastic show is being
4,AYBS? The MOVIE,"I bought this movie on VHS awhile back. I found it a bit DRY/BLAND and not as funny as the rest of the TV Shows. I have the ENTIRE Collection of AYBS which I bought on Amazon.com on DVD (bought the BOX SET)plus I also have the entire collection of 'Grace and Favor (AYBS? Again in the USA). I absolutely love this British Television Comedy Series and I NEVER get tired of watching these movies! Anyway, for you die-hard FANS out there, go ahead and buy this DVD movie and add it to your collection. I will also purchase it because it is on DVD even tho I have it on VHS.LeRoy"
1,they didn t even get my order right,as of now I haven't receive my packageand this is the second time around I didn't even receive the second shipment
1,Two thumbs down,"My husband and I are fans of the series. In fact, we added this to our cart when we ordered the complete series, recently. What a disappointment! The production was poorly done, barely on the scale of a high school production. It wasn't funny (with only one chuckle elicited between us), and with none of the charm of the original series. It's going in the dust bin."
1,Movis Disappointment,"This movie is a disaster. The on,.y reason I am keeping it is becauseI have the full series of ""Are You Beoing Served"" seasons."
5,Hilarious,"The movie was absolutely hilarious. The cast at it's best, if you are a fan of ""Are You Being Served"" this is a must see movie. You can't help but laugh throughout the film. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of British comedy, especially Are You Being Served."
1,OH. MY. GOD.,"i wanted to like it. i love the tv show. but this movie is SO BAD it is embarrasing. i don't know why writers perry and croft thought this was ok. after seeing the script, the cast should have mutineed. there's nothing new here except a change of scenery. all the jokes, gags, and situations are lifted from various episodes of the tv show. the story is PIT.I.FUL. hopefully this review will help someone avoid purchasing this dvd. if it only helps one person, it will have been worth it."
2,DATED COMEDY,"The staff of the clothing section of a department store all go on holiday to the Costa Plonka. A spin off movie of the famous 1970s British sitcom series of the same name is little more than an extension of a standard episode of the seires only it looks slightly more realsitic being made in film. Humphries causes some amusement as his overly camp and flamboyant character, whilst Mollie sugeden gets a few of the laughs too. The film really lacks any sort of direction and never once are you treated to outdoor, exotic locations. so basically all of the action takes place in the hotel. Rather like a substandard Carry On film. Fans will undoubtedly be delighted whilst people unfamiliar with the series will remain unamused. On the whole, mediocre at the most with a few laughs along the way but in all honest the whole thing seems terribly dated now. Recommended to fans of the series regardless."
1,Do Not Buy This DVD,"If you love the series you will hate this movie. How it could be this awful but still have John Inman and Mollie Sugden in it is a mystery. It is painfully, PAINFULLY, bad. Not at all funny and a complete waste of a very talented group of actors."
2,Only watch it if you are a fan of the show.,"The TV show Are You Being Served? has to be one of my all time favorites, and I believe it truly is the funniest British comedy ever on TV. However, the movie was lacking.As I first started watching this movie, while they were still in the shop, I noticed that something was lacking, that something about it felt empty. It was the lack of a laugh track. Now, in all honesty, most of the time I prefer there not be a laugh track, but in Are You Being Served, a laugh track is essential. Without the laugh track, the comedic timing of the show was thrown off from the start.Then, as they get into the movie, the jokes aren't new, and the conflict is predictable and leaves you yearning for it to be over.If you are a huge fan of AYBS and want to have the complete collection, that is the only reason I would suggest buying this. It is the only reason I bought it, and the only value I see in it. There is definitely little (if any) entertainment value."
3,A bit disappointing,"I love the series and can watch it over and over again. However, the movie does not do the same for me. I don't know why but it's a bit bland for my taste."
4,I Was Served a Fun Movie!,I've been watching the reruns of this show for many years and I still find myself smiling or chuckling in every episode. The movie didn't disappoint even though some of the gags were rehashed from the TV version. Somethings are funny more that just the first time you see or hear them. Good quality dvd.
3,Funny Video....,"I love the series and this was a extra added attraction. I gave it to someone who had never seen the series and they liked it a lot--- thought it very funny. Lots of inuendos, as per the series."
2,Disappointed,"I have been a fan of Are You Being Served? since I first discovered it on my PBS television station. When I discovered that there was a movie on video,I couldn't wait to see it,and ordered it from Amazon. After watching it, I was very disappointed. The castwas great in the store,but like Are You BeingServed? Again, the AYBSMovie,(I'm sorry to say)left much to be desired."
5,One of the best BritComs,"This has to be one of the funniest BritComs ever. Non-stop laughter, hillarious situations and great characters. Only the Brits can do this."
4,Entertaining for AYBS? fans,"Produced to help revive the then-flagging British film industry, the ""Are You Being Served?"" movie lacks the timing, immediacy, and warm-hearted familiarity of the brilliant TV series, but fans of the show will enjoy seeing the staff of Grace Brothers trying to make the best of a mandatory vacation at a miserable Spanish resort. Some of the jokes are recycled from the series, and others are humorous new additions to the series' repertoire, though the lack of a live audience affects both the timing of the performance and the overall atmosphere of the film. The quality of the film on the DVD is excellent, though the disc is, disappointingly, lacking in special features; the only feature included is the original theatrical trailer shown to British cinema audiences (though in obviously worn and deteriorated quality). The ""Are You Being Served?"" movie certainly isn't cinematic excellence, but is nonetheless a funny adventure for fans of the TV series to enjoy."
3,"Well, it's a movie alright.","I strongly suggest you skip this and go right to the 7 DVD box-set. Although this is clever in many ways, it's a rehash of other episodes, though the ""Dear Sexy Knickers"" bit is nearly flawless. Like all AYBS items, this has at least one priceless moment that'll make you glad you have it for your collection. But if you're on a budget, look at the box set."
2,Don't Even Think About It.,"Are You Being Served? The Movie is definitely only for the most die-hard of fans.Don't buy it. The jokes are identical from the series, including the whole ""Sexy Knickers"" episode. There is nothing new that you haven't already seen in the series. Yes, they may have been removed from the store and sent on a vacation. But, the story doesn't add anything to the pre-existing dynamic between the characters.Definitely missing is the Laugh Track or Live Studio Audience feel. Somehow, the jokes don't seem to be as funny.This will work for you if you are a die-hard fan who wants to complete his/her collection of Are You Being Served? footage."
3,Big screen visit,"All our favorite characters from the TV series, Are You Being Served, in a big screen production. It's fun and the humor is intact, but ironically the TV production is better. Just goes to show that bigger isn't always better, nevertheless a must see for die-hard AYBS fans!"
3,Paliamo Italiano,Everything about the description of the textbook was fine. The book just took too long to get here. I send packages across the U.S. and it takes three days. (Parcel Post) Why did this one textbook take two weeks?
5,Simply outstanding,"I have a shelf full of sanders and right now we're building 50 oak thresholds for our motel in my shop. None of my single speed older sanders were very good for finishing either the wood or for sanding between coats of polyurethane finish. I ordered this Makita from Amazon and it showed up 19 hours later. I turned it on, then rolled that speed knob down to ""slow"" and it purrs like an idling inline 6, with no torque reaction to hinder your control. My helper and I were nearly speechless about how easy it was to use this light & near-silent tool, and it made all the difference in our being able to get a craftsmanlike result. I guess I'm a little obsessive about things like wood finishes and tools, but I just can't say enough about this piece. Thank you Makita for making the best sander in my fleet of tools, and to Amazon for your $79 annual fee for 0-extra 2-day shipping (I paid $3.99 extra to get it overnite under this program). Amazon=Awesome"
1,Save your money - don't buy Makita,The first time I used this sander the dust bag clip broke. It continued to stay attached so I continued to use it. Yesterday it finally broke off completely. I called Makita... they require you to send the entire tool to them for warranty repairs. This is not only costly but requires me to buy another sander to use in the meantime. They were willing to sell me a new bag though... stay away from Makita... Porter Cable and Dewalt are much more consumer friendly.
5,Wonderful,my review is for the childrens book. The pictures are beautiful. What a great idea. This is for any age group I bought it for my best friend. What a great gift to give your child.
5,"Very fast, reliable","Nothing special about it, except its above average speed. No problems so far. Good buy overall."
4,Even better than her last!,"I thought ""A Kiss In The Dark"" was an okay read, so I was pleasantly surprised about how much I loved book 2, ""A Kiss Before Dawn"". The ""romantic/suspense"" review threw me for a loop so I kept putting it back in my TBR pile.This was not what I would categorize as a romantic/suspense. The premise *does* include a mystery, but the romance is at the forefront.An exciting mix of: sexual tension, sensuality, scorching love scenes, and unrequitted lovers finding each other again, is what to look forward to in ""AKBD"".Another great Avon author to watch."
3,Sara's Father,"This is from the Silhouette Special Edition version of this book:Once, skinny Erin Delaney and popular Sam Stone shared teenage high jinks, load of laughter...and a breathless, tentative passion. But their future had lain far afield - wrenching Erin away, wedding Sam to Erin's sister. And what might have been...never was.Now, an endless decade later, Erin again plunged deep into Sam's unforgettable gaze - over the head of a feisty, motherless tot who called Sam ""Daddy."" Irrepressible little Sara stole Erin's heart...yet made her ache with secret sorrow. Now with Sara's every hungry smile and Sam's tormenting touches, the past haunted Erin, taunted her, with what might never be...."
5,best donkey kong thing ever,"i like this movie becuase of it's action story and great songs this is the best movie i ever saw i recommend buying a copy today! I also give it more than 5 stars i give it a 1,000 sters!"
4,"The Artful, Cute Idea Cupcake Book","Wow, What a marvelous little book!!!With these recipes at hand, any ""amateur"" pastry chef can wow a crowd. Well I hope professionals are not looking for recipe ideas here!!! Expecially at $13.00.It gives equipment needed, directions,awesome pictures, and a wealth of advise.Napkin Wrapped Cupcakes on page 43 was a hit at our law office.Creativity and Presentation is the hardest to achieve and this hits the mark!!! You won't regret it...PS. They go great with a cappuccino!!!"
5,The Artful Cupcake,"For anyone who loves to decorate, this book is for you. The different frostings, especially the chocolate clay are dynamite!The finished look of your baked goods will markedly improve--making you the bakeshop diva of your office!"
2,A disappointment,"The movie made a number of frustrating changes to the book, was poorly acted, poorly shot (confusing angles, etc.) and was generally frustrating."
3,Translation,I wonder how many of the reviewers have read Bukowski.I wonder if any of those who have read Bukowski understand him.I wonder that no one has mentioned him before now in realtion to this film.I think Penn was reaching for someting else here and did not quite get there.I don't think anyone who has written a review before this one really understands that.Bukowski would curse here and someone would be offened and report this and it would be taken down.Sean Penn knows this and did the best he could without his work being taken down.Where have all the Chinaskis gone?
1,Sean Penn should have stayed at Ridgemont High,"Other reviews give a good overview of the plot, such as it is. The acting by Jack Nicholson and David Morse is superb as always, but their best efforts can't save this disjointed, pretentious film full of existentialist garbage. This is one of those films that never seems to want to get to the point! I thought it appropriate at the end when Nicholson and Morse were crying together: I think they might have been glad this movie was finally over so they could then use their talents for a director who actually knows what to do with talent when he sees it. Sean Penn, go back to being surfer dude; it suits you better."
1,How low can you sink in the movie industry,"This movie is a pure example of something that presumably only was made because someone wanted to earn some bucks. An extremely silly story, the actors spend most of their time unauthentically crying, sobbing, and sniffing. A useless plot. I wonder why such a professional team of actors submits to such a stupid project. On a scale of 1 to 5 the movie deserves a 0."
1,just awful,Wow. This film is pure drivel. What an utter mess. How humiliating for the actors. What was Sean Penn thinking? Why was this film ever made?
1,Worthless,"Unless you are a die hard Jack Nicholson fan DO NOT buy this movie. It's boring, slow and the acting (other then Nicholson and Houston) is incredebly poor. Sean Penn is much better actor then a writer and director. The only star goes to Nicholson's performance and sountrack."
4,Grieving dad gets a little twisted.,"The Crossing Guard DVD version great on screen, makes good use of entire screen...This one is a little different, a little twisted..dark. A grieving dad loses sight of reality because of his grief...In the end it's his little girls killer who makes him face it..The dad is the bad guy, the killer is the unfortunate good guy, but you'll connect with them both...Emotional, especially if you're a parent..Good watch.."
4,A Haunting Tale Of Forgiveness,"This is a strange movie. That's what I thought when I first saw this a decade ago. It was one of those films I thought about a couple of days later and couldn't get out of my head for a short while. When I saw it again a few years ago I almost had the same reaction.What's different about this film is the message: forgiveness. That's really what it's about and it's done in a touching way even though most of the characters in here are anything but nice people.If you can enjoy a good character-development story and not get too dismayed by a depressing scene or two this movie will reward you with some intangibles that are hard to describe unless you've seen this.Jack Nicholson, David Morse, Angelica Huston and Robin Wright make for an interesting foursome, I'll say that.If you don't like this movie, I would understand that, too. It's not an easy film to like. It will either haunt you or put you to sleep. It haunted me."
1,Great Jack and little else.,Jack does his best to usher the viewer through a boring and sometimes downright dumb script. The chase scene.... Jack runs and runs and drags us along to nowhere. There's some nudity in there for no reason at all but should please some. At the end of it I just had no feeling about it. An hour and 45 minutes of inert material.
4,Story line was different.,"I liked it because I enjoy watching David Morse, I find him to be a believable actor. This story line was from a different perspective."
2,The heart is in the right place.....,"....but the movie is overlong and clobbers you over the head with symbolism and metaphor. Also, not for one minute can you see Jack Nicholson OUTSIDE of Jack Nicholson and INSIDE the character he's playing, a common failing in recent Nicholson roles but more than usually apparent here. It's too bad, because his co-stars, especially David Morse, all give excellent performances. But the whole thing is turgid and FEELS contrived, though I'll grant that Sean Penn gave the story and the movie his best shot."
3,cd rom,"This works ok on my old pc but unfortunately anything above windowsXP wont, so the laptop on windows7 that i wanted to use this on, for my classes,is totally incompatable. Pity as this is the type of product i could really make use of."
4,Great with or without the color,"This is a great lip gloss that can be worn by itself, as well as over on Outlast lipcolor.It is a subtle lip gloss, great for when you don't want to wear too much make-up."
1,Why would you buy this?,"Why would anyone buy this since each pack of Outlast comes with a clear top coat?I have tried several different colors of Outlast, following the directions to a T. Each time, I have had HORRIBLE results. The edges start to flake when I put the top coat on.Taking it off is PAINFUL. The directions say to use warm soap and water or baby oil. I've tried both and baby oil works the best. However, baby oil gel is even better because you have to wait and let your lips 'soak'. I still ended up scrubbing my lips to get all of it off.The Max Factor version isn't much better.I'll stick with my Revlon Lipglide and Maybelline Wetshine Diamonds."
4,Informative,"Very informative, gave me a history of my family with pictures and information that was missing. Also was interesting reading about other families and the history of the region. Well worth the purchase."
2,Flaky pen that is troublesome,"It's an impressive looking pen. However, it unscrews when in your inside pocket and deposits the ink in your jacket. It leaks around the ferrule and puts black ink stains on your finger. Mine has now stopped writing; it does not deliver ink to the nib. Yes, I bought it from a reputable shop [...] and it has been back to Montblanc before. At 70 a service I have decided to use a reliable Parker--cheap and fun! 500 for a Montblanc--not again. Mine is consigned to the bottom drawer."
4,Excellent Music fun for the whole family,"I truly enjoyed this game when I first bought it, about 5 years ago! I sold my copy on Amazon.com, but still have the Japanese import copy I bought from EBay. I like this game, and appreicate how the scoring sysem has been improved over the first, Bust A Groove/Move.I would recommend this game to any gamer who is addicted to music games, such as myself. I'll give this 4 stars, only due to graniness of video, and slight drop in catchiness of songs. Other than that, stone col' gaming!MC White said: Check it out! Two thumbs up!!!"
2,scratches on the disc,"scratches on the discdue to scratches with the disk, you can not play well and consequently remains lockout, this game is great but because of that failure will not be able to play not even in practice mode because it is the mp3 audio"
4,Just as much fun as the first Bust-A-GROOVE,"If you liked the first, you'll like the second. Many of the same characters are still there, plus a few new cool ones. Each character as a story line that they follow the the final character which is kind of a suprise. The venues for each character are more elaborate, and more stuff happens when you dance well."
5,I LOVE THIS GAME!,"I love to play Bust-A-Groove 2! It is very fun and very addictive. The only problem is, I cannot find a place to buy it. I have played it at my friends house, and I want to buy it myself, but I can't find it anywhere! It makes me very mad!"
4,I have the demo of this game....,".... and it rocks! I had never played the original Bust a Groove, but the 2nd one is so much fun! You've got to have a decent sense of rhythm to get this game down, and it's never boring. Well, it would be boring if you play it alone, so make sure you've got a dancing partner! You'll love BAG2!"
4,I liked this game,"I played the original Bust A Groove game at a friends house, and I immediately got hooked. Afterwards I went searching for the game, but to no avail. Then I found Bust a Groove 2, and I also love it. The songs are still catchy and the moves are good. And if you can hit the really high scores there are special moves you can do(Make sure to keep a watch on Shorty's little mouse which is now located on her head.) There are some things I don't like though. They got rid of song that I liked (kitty nyanko's) and shorties moves aren't as cools as they were in the original. But it's sure to get you hooked and maybe even make you want to start taking dance lessons yourself."
2,had to assemble,"This is a beautiful locket. However, when I received mine, it was in 3 pieces. I had to assemble the pieces together at the hinges by inserting included rods through the hinges. I suppose most of thee lockets arrive fully assembled, but mine did not."
1,No Good!,Don't waste your money! I bought this locket to give to my mother for christmas. It does not stay closed. Just by picking up the locket to put it on it comes undone. I didnt realize this major flaw existed until after I had gone to the trouble of having pictures sized down. That in addition to the fact that it was already so close to christmas I decided to keep the locket and take it to a jeweler to see what could be done. For a fee the jeweler agreed to add a extra closure to the locket. He said he has had ten or so locketscome in recently with the same problem. Buyer beware. I will have to wait a week or so for the locket o be ready and after the extra cost I should have gone with another locket.
3,Its nice,It is an average size locket in comparison to others on here. It only holds two pictures. It does not come with a clear cover for your pictures. When I bought the locket I thought it held four pictures. I think if your creative with glue it could hold four. I did not have trouble with the clasp as others have.
4,I heart this locket!,"This locket was perfect for what I needed. The one downside was that it was a bit hard to get engraved, otherwise, simply wonderful!"
4,just what my daughter wanted,good product for the money; I'm not a runner but my daughter was pleased. Packaging was adequate and product arrived intact.
4,Great!!!!,"The belt was exactly what I was looking for, bottles came out easily when running. Service was great also, when requested on a rush for a run they gladly replied."
4,Fuel Belt,Great product and works as advertised. My previous belt had bottles that clipped onto the belt which was more efficient and less disruptive but I kept losing bottles. This one is much more secure and the design is such that the bottles don't bounce when we are running or biking.
5,Great adjustable belt,"I purchased this for my first half marathon and while it took a little getting used to, what I really like about this belt is the ability to adjust the size. Whereas some belts are a specific waist size, this is much more adjustable to your comfort level and waist size. Great product."
3,So so,"I read the reviews and thought Id made a good decision but not sure yet. Im a first time runner and this is my first hydration pack.One of the bungies that loops over the top of my water bottle busted with first use... that sucked.The other complaint is that I also had problems with it riding up as I ran. That was a little annoying too.Other than that... it was snug and I didnt feel the bouncing. IT seemed balanced even if one bottle was more full than the other. It held my gu, keys, and ipod nano 8g and still had some room for more? I loved that the little pouch has an EXTRA pouch on the inside with a velcro closure... made my ipod feel more secure.Overall... I think it will get the job done but IM sure there are better ones out there."
4,Pretty good,"Belt is adjustable, quite comfortable. Nicely designed pouch holds keys etc. without rattling. Bottle shape and position is good. Comfortable while running. Straps hold the bottles securely but I've found it takes two hands to get it back in. Only complaint in the bottles is the pull-tops don't stay open for me. I have to hold the bottle open with my teeth while trying to drink. Could be just the ones I got. Bottle opening is large enough for your basic ice cube. I'm not sorry I bought it. Nice for the longer runs. Better than the big 20oz bottle holders."
4,Awesome,"Got this for my wife, it does the job, keeps her hydrated on her runs. No complaints at all. Awesome!"
4,Proof viair and Masterflow are similarly produced,This Viair's air hose and the MV-50/MF-1050 's air hose are exactly the same. I would say that Viair and Q-Industries must be made from similar parts sourcing. Quality is excellent as usual for Viair.. which is the premium label.The only issue is that the brass nozzle will warp over time due to the tilting to deflate.
4,Grupo Tradicao,I bought this CD because I saw them guest on a Bruno & Marrone concert and thought they were go so I decided to take a blind chance and order a CD. Well I loved it and am now looking to see if I can find Vol. 1 since this is volume 2/
1,Very Unimpressive,"A historical novel which is pretty flat and unimpressive throughout. It is set in Carthage, c. 219 BC as a young Hannibal is making his march on Rome. The title and copy made me think it would be more of a thriller, rather than the weak soap-opera it turned out to be. There is a bit to be learned about the customs and manners of Carthage, but the plot is so silly I don't advise spending your time on this book. It relies on one unbelievable coincidence after another--much like Melrose Place, only without the verve. Steer clear."
1,How can anyone like this singer?,"I made the big mistake of purchasing this album. Briefly, Kurt Elling seriously disappoints in his singing style, his poor voice and inability to even sing on key. If he went amatuer hour, he would be dismissed in the first call.If this is where music is going, we are all in trouble. I will stick to the far better jazz singers. Guess anyone can market an album these days, regardless of talent."
4,a great introduction to Kurt Elling,"This was the furst Kurt Elling disc that I picked-up...what a fun record, although the music is why I like to play it so much.It has a little taste of everything. I won't go into the track by track hightlights, but I like the overall program here very much.Hobgood sound terrific on this, and I enjoyed the guest performances. Kurt's ballad performances are terrific, but then so are the cookers.This record does a good job capturing the atmosphere of a night at the Green Mill, which is a favorite Chi-town nightspot due to it's unique atmosphere coupled with the opportunity of seeing some great jazz talent in a smaller venue.However, it's definitely the music that keeps me coming back.Shawn"
5,YES!,"I've been a huge fan ever since my (then) 17 year old nephew turned me on to Kurt. All of his CD's get five stars in my opinion! He scats, he be-bops, he croons, HE SINGS! What a talent! And the rest of the band is equally impressive. These guys cook! Great live CD. Great take on My Foolish Heart. Can't wait to see them at the Backstage Bistro in St Louis next month!"
4,An AIC Must!,"I am not an ""unplugged"" fan....especially of rock music....it's the waling of guitars and volume that rocks....but, I'd have to say that this band, this album, is a must! It is my one and only unplugged album of any band, and i can listen to it over and over and over.You can NOT go wrong if you are looking at this album!"
4,A nice one for your collection,"Well, I'm not a huge fan of hard rock, but this is a keeper. The unplugged aspect of this album I feel lends a much more 'musical' quality to the CD. Here, Alice in Chains shows their gentleness as well as their rock talent.Familiar songs are taken a little slower, giving the listener a more pensive view of their work.If you are to have 1 Alice in Chains album, this is it."
4,A rarity in Grunge,One of the rarist finds in music is a grunge-rock album that is well recorded and produced. This is indeed one of them. The emotion is all there but without the distortion and compression techniques used far too often in rock music productions. I think even those that are not Alice In Chains fans will find much to appreciate and enjoy here.
5,Just... amazing!,I love Alice in Chains. One of the most recognized grunge bands of all times. A definitely plus and must for fans or those who want to listen to the raw energy and power of this band. Highly recommend.
5,Goosebumps!,"I grew up with R&B, motown oldies and dance music, but one day my boyfriend (who is a die hard rock fan)play a video tape of MTV unplugged and I just sat there and listened in aww. I am now a die hard AIC fan and I've grown to love many rock artist since then and I listen to AIC every day. This is a definite AIC collection must! I recommend it to anyone who really appreciates awsome music!"
4,The lighter side of a heavy band.,"To me, the softer side of ""Alice In Chains"" is just as impressive as their metal/grunge side is, and if you enjoy their ""Sap/Jar Of Flies"" ep's, this is something you want to have. It's similar to ""Nirvana's"" unplugged album, but with that added ""A.I.C."" spookiness of course. Great song selection too. ""Nutshell"" is a perfect opener, and one of my favorite songs of theirs. Other tracks that work well here are ""Down In A Hole"", ""Brother"", ""Rooster"", and ""Over Now"". Plus it ends with the great ""Killer Is Me"". Overall, I think this is just as essential as ""Nothing Safe"" or ""Dirt"". Now I ask the question, where's that ""Pearl Jam"" unplugged?"
4,Alice in Chains Unplugged,"As I write this review I happen to be listening to the CD. I'm not a hardcore Alice in Chains' fan, however I happen to be one of Mtv Unplugged. This Unplugged session is great, although somehow too slow at the beggining (but not boring at all). All of the songs were perfectly arranged & Cantrell's guitar solos are simply amazing. For me the highlight of the CD is without any doubt ""Would?"". About the ""Nirvana vs. Alice in Chains"" issue that people tend to talk about whenever reviewing this CD I have to say that it's impossible to compare this two CDs in which both bands printed their own unique style. AiC's was darker while Nirvana's was played in a more ""tunned down"" style, however they were both great.I give this CD 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think they lacked some creativity in the songs. Don't get me wrong, they sound real good, however I think they may have used extra instruments (violins, celli, etc.) to make it sound a little more different."
5,Amazing CD. Best Ever,I listen to this cd almost everyday driving to my car. It is great and I highly recommend it
3,Not Alice In Chains at its best...,"I bought this CD a while ago, and to say the least... I was a little bit disappointed. The songs on this CD lack the raw emotion and genius that the recorded versions have. While it is always good to hear a band live instead of just living off the recorded versions, and always expecting perfection, I don't think this CD is a very good representation of Alice In Chains live. They butcher most of the songs by playing them on acoustic guitar. The vocals are too brought out, and the guitars/drums/bass are too flooded out.This threw me off, because most Unplugged performances are amazing, and worth your money and then some. I guess Alice In Chains just isn't a band meant for the set up they had."
1,Alice n Chains,Alice n Chains? What a great group. Lovr thier video and dvd's. I try to collect them as muc as possibe. AMAZON-YOUR GREAT!!!
1,wrong items,Both items sent to me were not the items i ordered. I was wondering if this happens often. I would like to continue wseing amazon to shop in the future if I can get the items i order.Im not going to rate theses items.
5,A beautiful performance,Absolute perfection....a must for every ALICE IN CHAINS fan...captured the emotions...this piece draws you in and you know you are witness to a magical night.
4,Very Good AIC Live Album,"This is just an excellent album. The song selection is excellent, and the band plays wonderfully. This can rival Nirvana's Unplugged album. Worth noting, however, is that for only two dollars more, you can get the DVD of this concert. The DVD is very well put together, and they play all of the music that appears on this CD. Still, this is a really good album for any fan of early nineties grunge."
5,A must have for music fans,"Although Im not a big AIC fan and never will be, I think this is one of the best rock albums out! The band put together many songs off their albums to put together one of the best live albums out. If you are a big AIC fan you must buy unplugged and if your not you still should buy it!"
5,Royal Artilllery Dress Book,A wonderful book showing Officers and men in uniform throughout the ages with detailed explanations of various parts of the uniform and uniform changes.
4,Patio Latch,"Decent price. Could be built to last longer,second time I had to replace it. The only thing that wears out is a tiny little hair spring.Perfect fit."
3,a hasty effort by Spillane..,"'Vengeance Is Mine"" is the third Mike Hammer novel by Mickey Spillane, and the weakest of the three. The plot itself has the usual assortment of murder and mayhem involving thugs, deadbeats, and buxom women. Mike Hammer, most inexplicably, continues to have the most extraordinary sex life. Every female he runs into professes their love. And the story's ending is, well, TOTALLY ABSURD. I sense the author wrote this novel at a bar one evening. Yet to his credit, the characterizations and the sleazy atmosphere the book projects are fun.Bottom line: probably best left to Spillane/Hammer loyalists."
3,More of the same from Spillane,"Private Detective Mike Hammer finds an old army friend dead and leaves a trail of broken heads (and hearts)through New York City as he searches for vengeance.Not the best of its kind, but enjoyable nonetheless. If you've read all of Chandler's novels, give Spillane a look."
2,Not worth it.,"I have read this book, and many others on the subject of Computer crimes. I can honestly say that this book is not worth your money. Markoff does a decent job describing the internet worm incident, but the other 2 parts of the book are boring, misleading, and not very good. I would recommend ""The Fugitive Game"" if you are intrested in Kevin Mitnick, which is often the reson this book is picked up in the first place."
4,A good read,This was a very captivating book. I enjoyed the level of technical detail that was provided. It was understandable for folks with little experience in the field yet filled with real life methods used by the more experienced individual.
3,"It's alright, I guess","This book would be well written and entertaining, if it were fiction. However, in its current state it is grossly biased reffering to Kevin as: ""The Dark Side Hacker"" and although it shows the motivations of his often backstabbing cohorts it does not peer into what he was thinking. It's an easy read with little technical information, and worth the money...I guess"
1,On the Outside Looking In.,"Although Markoff is an exceptional writer and the book is both easy to read and entertaining, the content is presented as factual when the truth is that these guys definitely wrote the book with only part of the whole story at their disposal. One of the main ""cyberpunks"" depicted in the book is Kevin Mitnick, who claims that he has never even met John Markoff. How can the book fairly and accurately speak to the topic of hacking during the early days of the Internet revolution when they never did any investigations with real ""hackers""? The story is told only from a law enforcement point-of-view. I am sure that the Rodney King story is told differently by King than the LAPD. Same goes for this case.Like many works today that seem to be written for financial reasons, it seems very one-sided and sensational."
2,Skip this one,If your looking for evil hackers mis-leading information and untrue stories. Then by all means read this book. But if your looking for a better account of Kevin Mitnick the most botched story in this book try The Fugitive Game by Littman it's much more acurate.
3,First and Interesting but Flawed,"Three case studies are provided, including one dealing with Robert Morris, son of a distinguished NSA scientist and the person who brought America to a standstill with an epidemic electronic virus. By two distinguished journalists who knew little about hackers but could recognize a great story when they saw one, this is one of the more important early books that erroneously labeled hackers as criminals and electronic criminals as hackers."

3,Maybe it was better years ago,"This book now seems very dated. Much of the great worldwide hacker scare is now past, I hope. The lives of three hackers are explored in the book, but all feel distant and uncertain. I didn't like the style of the writing and I didn't learn very much about the people or about computers. As a window on recent history, I can recommend the book, but not for fun or education."
5,Better than I thought!!,"This book was actually more entertaining than i thought. I read it during finals week. It was very interesting, took only two daysof my leisure time. I enjoyed the way that it captivated me. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good book with some real life tones. d:)~"
4,Three short stories dealing with hackers and cyber thieves.,"I found this book interesting, whether you are interested and/or work with computers, or not. The three stories deal with Kevin Mitnick, the now infamous hacker who has had several brushes with the law; a German hacker breaking into U.S. Govt. computers; and the story of a Cornell computer science student who inadvertantly caused numerous systems across the internet to bog down due to a program he had written to expose a security flaw in the UNIX operating system. All three stories are entertaining regardless of the reader's technical knowledge. It also is an eye-opener to the vulnerabilites which exist in the nation's computing environment. Very entertaining."
4,Pure Info,"This book is just fretboard maps of chords and voiceings. It is a wonderful referance tool and will add flavors to your sound stew. This is not a book to be used as a ""How To"" or self instructional tool, it's not laid out that way. SO, if you are looking for a way to get through a progression with out sounding like EVERYBODY ELSE this is the book. If you are just trying to figure what a Cmaj7 is There are a number of chord dictionaries that are better suited for the purpose.Buy this book if you are are planing on going pro, or are seriously into musical studies.Not really worth buying for the incidental guitarest."
3,I did not get the right one,I did not get the right one. Maybe I was trying to get another book. But I mistook this one for something else. It is mostly keys on the guitar.
2,Problem,Hole in case for Headphone cable not large enough to allow head phone cable to be plugged in all the way. Making it useless.
3,"Great case, Wrong Description","This is a fantastic case. The color is somewhat translucent and the case appears sturdy. The only problem is that this case only fits the first generation Nano. The description states that it also fits the second generation, which is incorrect. Note the rounded corners on the case. My second gen Nano has squared corners and didn't fit.If you have a first gen, I'd highly recommend this case."
4,Good ntro to mandolin,"This is a good general introduction to the mandolin, suitable for those with no background in string instruments.A previous reviewer stated that the book included standard notation and tablature. That is incorrect. There is no tablature for the musical selections in this book."
3,ok,"OK for the money with varied info but short on the mechanics of playing. Uses the ""low' thumb position. Really could use a dvd. On the other hand, has varied scores of different types of music and gives info not found in other starter learning material that I have seen."
3,To Much on Music Theory,"I purchased this book on ratings and found it to be very in depth. This is a good book if you have a good background in music, but if you do not it may be over your head. I use this book very little as I have found much better in depth books available.BillN.C."
5,Mando-Made-Easy,"I've had a mando for about 5 years now that was left to me by a friend that passed away. I am a musical person, but until now I haven't found an instructional book (I've gone through maybe 5)that has worked for me. This book is EXTREMELY intuitive and I would recommend it to anyone trying to learn to play this instrument. The first few pages do a great job of illustrating the relationship between the sheet music and the instrument. It then gives short repetitive exercises to get each new note, time signature, and scale etched into your memory. Bravo to the author. I haven't even made it all the way through the book and I'm already 100% satisfied. I bet you will be too. Happy Mandolining."
4,great book,"Awesome little starter book. Gets you playing basic tunes within a couple days. I wanted to enjoy playing the mandolin, not make it another task such as learning scales before you can play anything. It goes in one string at a time. I learned about one string a day, and by day three I was playing the basics ""Merrily we Roll Along"", ""Jingle Bells"", ""Jimmy Crack Corn"" and others. I have played the sax years ago and it seem to be a lot of work. I wanted something to ""pick"" while watching commercals on TV! I would have gone 5 stars if the book came with a CD. Many people told me this is the book to start with, and they were right BUY IT!!!"
5,seems great,"Got for Christmas along with the mandolin, strap and case. We only went through some of the book but it is easy to follow and has a lot of information in it. My daughter was able to play it right away and was sooo happy!"
2,lesson flaws,Expects one to learn music term terms and know rhythms without explinations. It does not help one to play with simple cords to accumpany songs. This could be done to give instant gradification.
2,"Okay, but just okay","I bought this book online when I first got my mando. A lot of the focus is on music theory rather than mandolin, so if you've ever played another instrument, it's a bit of a yawner."
2,Why does this book get such good reviews?,"I don't see how this book can claim that you can ""Teach Yourself to Play Mandolin"". It also claims that it is ""For Beginners of all Ages."" I disagree. There is very little instruction in this book. Mostly songs. I am a novice guitar player with plenty of great guitar instruction books so I know a good ""teach yourself"" book when I see one. Dan Fox's is not one."
3,Not bad but very simple,"This is a very simple method to play mandolin. This simplicity makes it incomplete. To really master the mandolin you need to learn more, and this method lack exactly that part that might go beyond the common and ordinary."
4,Mandolin - great starter version!,This was a gift to our very musical grandson - our son has one just like that launched this mandolin playing. For the price - you can't beat it!
2,Waste of money,"Was not happy with this book, have been playing Mandolin for about a year now and found this book to be very complicated and difficult to understand. No basics were found and need to go over with fine toothed comb to understand"
3,The beginning of the end.,"Although this recording had some good chart success, it failed to come close to their last recordings Escape and Infinity. It contains a few trademark ballads but the overall sound seemed an unwanted ""departure"" for their fans. This one's for true fans only."
3,On The Frontier,"After the success of Escape, Journey followed it up with Frontiers which follows the same blueprint, a mix of hard rockers, power ballads and mid-tempo songs. While it has some good work, the overall album doesn't match Escape's creativity and power. ""Separate Ways"" starts off the album on a high note with its pumping synths and searing Neal Schon solo. ""After The Fall"" is an underrated song and contains a fine Steve Perry vocal. ""Faithfully"" tries to match ""Open Arms"" but it doesn't come close. Some other good songs include ""Chain Reaction"", the title track and ""Edge Of The Blade"", but rest including the insipid ""Send Her My Love"" isn't very good."
2,uuuuuuuuuugh.....,"Man, it's hard to stomach this bunch of sugary pop love songs. It was already diffcult for Journey to follow the fantastic album ESCAPE, but I never expected that its follow-up would be so much worse like this FRONTIERS. It sounds almost like Foreigner! It's only marginally better because Journey's musicians are really skilled.Uuugh.!"
4,Great - But not the Best,"This is the last of three solid albums put out by Journey (avec Steve Perry). Although Escape and Infinity are a half grade higher in quility and consistiency, this is a strong album and a great swan song to remember a powerful eighties pop rock band by. After this, Raised on Radio appeared and Journey enjoyed all the chart climbing success of David Caruso after NYPD Blue."
1,Item was NEVER shipped,"To date, my order that was placed on October 1st has not shipped. The estimated delivery time was 10/08 to 10/26. Today is 10/28. Item status is now showing 'shipping soon'. There's no option for a refund. Seller does not respond to emails."
3,Lacks pronunciation key.,"Good size and good number of words for my 3rd grader. But lacks pronunciation key, forcing us to go to other dictionaries or online.Unless your child is of ayoung age, I recommend getting a dictionary that has the pronunciation keys."
5,"great book, highly recommended","This is the best book on PTSD I have read.I found the spiritual and psychological insights uplifting. It is a powerful read.As the previous critic stated, it is not a ""technical"" book with exact somatic therapy techniques listed.I did not find it extremely upsetting that the Author and one of her most important clients had passed away, death is an inevitable part of life.Although I appreciated how the Author explained her own experience of recovery -- this was at first overwhelming to me. It took longer to integrate thisfor me.For This reason I would not necessarily recommend it to a recovering client of PTSD.However, I think the examples she used to demonstrate her experience with clients were fine because although you might not relate to their exact situation this is helpful to distance yourself yet still be conscious of how tragedy can strike anyone."
1,Not a Good Target,"I would not purchase this product again, it has ruined arrows and arrows have passed through the center of it"
2,Romance and Introspection,'Mill on the Floss' meets what was an attempt at an inner view on what this author felt an extremely wealthy disabled French warrior's feelings would be as he fell in love with his secretary.
3,Mediocre Performance,"To be honest, this CD was a disappointment even though I am a fan of Ruth Ann Swenson. The usual criticism of her (that her singing is too bland and cold despite the warm tone of her voice) applies to this recording once again. Her Violetta was, well to put it politely, extremely boring. There is something definitely wrong when you are bored listening to ""Estrano...Sempre libera"". It was almost emotionless. Also, replacing the tenor part with a cello simply did not work for me. When you have Tebaldi's and Sutherland's singing in your ears, some of the selection just will not work for you.Now that I have my criticism out of the way, I did enjoy her ""Caro nome"" and ""Prendi, prendi"" very much. I was feeling pretty bad, feeling that I wasted fifteen dollars, when I first listen to this CD until I got to ""Caro nome."" I have not found a recording of ""Caro nome"" that I liked except for Galli-Curci's until now. At least for me it was worth paying fifteen dollars."
3,a new direction for Swenson,"This CD, I think, shows the potential future direction of Swenson's career, as well as giving a nod to her earlier roles; by this I mean that her most successful performances on this disc, somewhat to my surprise, are her Puccini arias, wherein the fuller body of tone comes into its own. I disagree with some of the other reviewers and find her coloratura arias more disappointing. Though she has a fine technique and an extensive range, she has never struck me as a natural coloratura; her voice lacks purity, she often pushes the notes in altissimo, and, perhaps because of singing too often at the enormous Met Opera House, the tone can become unsteady. Her singing of the Puccini was also more imaginitive and word responsive than her bel canto pieces. So, contrary to the reviewer who wants to hear her in Lucia, Puritani, etc, I think Swenson's future lies with Mimi, both Manons, and other more lyric (and eventually lyric-dramatic) roles."
1,Give it up Ruth Ann,"I bought this CD without listening to it first in the store because I have several other CD's with Ruth Ann Swenson on them and I liked what I heard. What I heard on this CD was totaly different. I wish I could return this CD because the only time I listen to it is when I need an a good laugh. In almost every Coloratura song that she sings her highest notes have a slow vibrato, sound anemic, and are usually very sharp. With all of the recording technology available these days why would she not go back and redo the bad parts in her songs. This CD will give you chills, but in the wrong way. I highly don't recomend buying this CD."
1,Takes wa--aay too long to deliver this probiotic supplement,"I ordered several items together, the others all showed up within 3 to 4 days. Only this one, it took 2 weeks to deliver to our house, without placing it on the ice pack or anything to keep it cold, supposedly for a Probiotic product!I don't know whom to blame for this packing & delay, just won't buy this product anymore."
4,Great cover for the price!,"I bought this to fit a Husqvarna zero radius riding mower. The fit is just a tad loose but it is certainly adequate. The extra pockets are a real plus. With Amazon Prime, this was a helluva bargain!"
2,Alexander Technique Lite!,"A very, very short book with very, very few words, and very, very many pictures.If you having Alexander lessons from a real a teacher, this book MIGHT be helpful. If you want to know what the Technique is about, and why having lessons is a very good idea, try Chris Stevens' ""Alexander Technique,"" Michael Gelb's ""Body Learning,"" and/or Frank Pierce Jones' ""Freedom to Change."""
1,Maxtor does not stand behind its products.,"Wait until you have problems with a Maxtor drive. Their tech support is lousy and their customer service is even worse. Forget their warranty, you can do better with Western Digital, Seagate or Hitachi."
3,No problems until...,"I had the 180 gig version of this drive. It worked perfectly for about 9 months. Then it crashed and by crashed I mean it ""lost it's formatting"" and I could no longer access the data saved on it. I am reluctant to blame this on Maxtor because it happened just after a power outage (and I was using a cheapo surge protector... my bad). Customer service was helpful and they offered to replace it for me. Still waiting on the data recovery though."
3,Good drive for the price,"There seem to be a lot of folks writing here who believe drives never fail. As an IT professional, I assure you, drives fail. All the time, all brands, all types. That's why IT departments put RAID5 arrays in their critical servers. If one drive fails the others take over so you don't go down. But if you buy ONE drive, never back it up and expect it to last forever, you're asking for disaster. Both Maxtor and Western Digital make adequate low-cost drives. Yes, they will crash sometimes. You get what you pay for. BACKUP BACKUP BACKUP!!!!"
1,Stay Away From Maxtor,"Stay Away, as far as you can! I can fry eggs on my Maxtor HDD. I asked the sales guy about this before I buy and he said ""this was in the past, not anymore"". I was in a rush to buy a HDD and most stores were closed. I should've waited...I know it will fail, it's just a matter of ""when"".Stay away..."
1,WinXP not Maxtor friendly,"I gave this 1 star because it still isn't working. If it ever does, it may gain more stars. The tech support says they are having problems with WinXP. I installed the setup program, but it won't run at all unless I use the compatibility wizard to set it for Win98 - and then it fails after a few minutes. When I boot from the CD, I want to make the new drive my boot drive, but can't get the files to copy - error message at about the 8% point. Tech support is very friendly, but after several calls they finally admitted to the WinXP file copy problem and suggested I buy Partition Magic or something similar. When that arrives perhaps my luck will change - but I've just discovered that PM specs say it handles only up to 80GB partitions. I had wanted 120 and 40, but may have to settle for less than I had hoped. All in all, not a good experience so far."
3,For Mac Users: If It Looks Too Good To Be True . . .,"One of the problems of purchasing items like this from Amazon.com (or any real-world store that might keep it behind the counter) is that you don't have a chance to inspect the box. Which, in this case, means that you wouldn't find out that you will have to buy an accessory for this before you can use it. So if that isn't an inconvenience in itself, you also find out that the low price tag isn't actually as low as it might seem. In fact, it's quite high . . . the additional part (an Ultra ATA/133 PCI Adaptor) will run you anywhere from $55-$85. Nothing to scoff at if you thought you were getting a deal on this drive."
3,Too noisy,"I bought this hard drive to replace an 80 GB Western Digital Drive. I had no difficulty installing it, and the drive performed fine except for the noise. It is perfectly quiet while idle but very noisy when accessing the drive. I returned it and bought a Seagate drive with comparable specs. The Seagate is whisper quiet."
3,pretty decent,"well i got the drive and it crashed within the first week but i sent it back to maxtor and they sent me a new one which works well now. Their support is really really good, and they took the drive back no questions asked. Im happy right now with its performance, but i do prefer my western digital and ibm (yes even my ibm) to the maxtor."
2,Not a fan of Maxtor,"I have/had a 160 serial ATA 100 drive. Worked great for less than a year. After a bad shut-down (forced by a locked-up computer) I received failure messages on boot-up. I attempted system recovery to no avail. I then turned my computer over to experts who are still trying to accomplish a data recovery process. In talking to them, apparently they receive more failed Maxtor drives than anything else. My recommendation-Go with Western Digital or Seagate. Maxtor...I want my money back!"
1,The Drive is fine - The software isn't,"I just installed this 160 GB drive. I used MaxBlast-3 to get it to look like a 100GB and a second 60GB drive. While I was installing Windows 2000 Pro and transfering data the directory structure became corrupted. I didn't know why so I just reformted the 100 GB partition and started over. Now the drives I'm replacing have become corrupted. I can't even slave them to another drive. ALL OF THE DATA IS NOW LOST!!! I thought it was just me but another review talks about the same problem. I talked to Maxtor support and they said they didn't see how MaxBlaster could affect another drive but suggested I get their Drive adapter card instead of using the disk overlay, implying that sooner or later I would lose data without the interface card."
4,Audiovox GMRS7001CH-2,"After a Christmas-crazy visit with my two boys to the states, and repeated fears of losing them in the crowds (they seem to enjoy cutting more years off my life than my ex-wife) I saw some family's using FRS radios. As I work with similar items in the military, I thought 'let's give it a shot'. I have to admit, I bought by price first, features second. I was pretty certain the 7-mile range wasn't going to ever be seen, but it certainly beat standing at the mall information counter paging the family. However, we've found each and every feature to work as advertised. Honestly, I've only tested them out to 5 miles, on a holiday drive in separate cars, but they've worked perfectly. Given price, performance-as-advertised, and easy online warranty and FCC license registration, I can't argue. I'm certain there are better out there, but I doubt it at this price."
1,Choosing Your Homebuilt : The One You'll Finish and Fly,This book is not very informative. It does not meet the expectations one gets from the title.
5,One of the best I've read,"This is one of the best books on ADD and ADHD that I have read. As a professional in the field, I will be recommending this book to the families I work with. It addresses all the questions that come up in the course of treatment. Packed with the latest research yet easy to read."
5,Undecided,"I agree with the review above. I have not read it yet either. I am trying to decide if I want this book. I think the book sounds great except for the fact that I want unbiased information, not a book with an agenda of never medicating kids. I certainly do not want to medicate my son, but from what I have learned so far for some kids it can be very positive. My job is to determine if my son is one of them or not. It would be nice to have an informative book that gives both sides -- does this book do this?"
4,"One of the better, or best ADHD books for parents and educators.","Susan Ashley's book on ADHD is one of the most informative books on the subject. It can help parents, as well as professionals and educators. Dr. Ashley is a psychologist with many years of experience with children. The book is well researched and well thought out. She does not push or even recommend medication, rather, encourages therapy, good parenting and educational remediation. The book is well-researched and authoritative. Ashley concludes that mediation can help some children some of the time, but it is not a cure-all and is not a miracle cure for ADHD."
4,Probably the best Greatest Hits album ever put out!,"Great mixing of songs, especially sound quality during ""live"" sound effects. With the Guitar play of Neil Schon, Keyboards of Greg Rollie (retired soon after this was released and replaced by ex-Baby's Jonathan Cain) Nice farewell to Rollie, who along with Schon and Dunbar (drums) and Valory (bass) originated Journey! Excellent playing on Bass by Steve Perry on track ""Party's Over!"". Must listen and buy if you are a ""true"" Journey fan! Truly one of the best ""recorded"" live albums around!"
5,Hopelessly In Love with this album,"Me and my dad purchased the CD just to listen to The Party's Over (Hopelessly In Love). Now, we love the whole album. The Party's Over is a great example of Steve Perry's wonderful vocal talents, along with other GREAT songs on it.This a must get for all true Journey fans."
3,its ok,its no where near 30x....maybe 10x...i gusess for 3 bux i cant complian LOL i wish i had read the reviews more carefully. kinda disapointed.
2,You WON'T even get what you Pay for!,"This is definitely NOT a 30X Loupe, it may not even be a 10X. It doesn't matter what price it is b/c if it doesn't work then you just bought paper weight. Save yourself the time and effort and look for a bood Belomo, atleast you'll be able to see with it."
3,It's not 30x,"This is a good little magnifier at a terrific price, but it is not 30x, and I don't know why it says it is. I have two other loupes, one that's 10x, and one that has both 15x and 20x, and this one seems to magnify a little better than the 10x. So, if you need high power, this isn't the magnifier you want. It is very easy to use, with a nice large diameter viewing area, and worth the price, but beware if you need higher power."
4,Stan's Review,"For the money, the is a fairly decent magnifying glass. Don't really expect it to be thirty power, though. It is more or less ten power as far as I can figure by comparing it to several expensive Hastings triplets I own.Where they got the ""approximately 30x"" from is anyone's guess unless they were trying to rate the thing by area magnification as opposed to linear magnification. In this case they got the formula wrong.Magnifiers are usually rate linearly, in that a 2x magnifier should make a one inch line appear two inches. This is the same as binoculars and other magnifying instruments though there is some kind of convention, I believe, of a standard ten inches with reading glass magnifiers.Whatever--the thing does have glass lenses as far as I can tell and it comes in a nifty little plastic box. It is a great little lens for a geology student or a nature buff and, at the price, makes a novel little gift."
2,Not really a 30X,Nice lens but not really 30X. I have a 20X and this one magnifies not even close to 20X. It looks like this is just a 10X like the other reviewer says.
3,"Good, but there are better ones...","Recently purchased this loupe, as an addition to another one I have. It is not the same quality, is made in China, magnifies, but not as well as other loupes I've used. However, it is better than nothing and more inexpensive than my other loupe. Just okay, but not great. Worth the price..."
2,A little disappointed =(,"The loupe looks like used, but it was posted as NEW item. The lense is slightly chipped. I am not a jewelry expert, so I am not planning to return it. But would be appreciated if the seller didn't lie about the item condition."
5,good nice to have,"bought this for seeing small things like jewelry, artwork, photo details and fine printing on computer pieces, works well. Nice."
5,loop,"works very well, i'am very happy with it. very compact, easy to carry around. great loupe for the price. i would recommend this procuct."
1,Item never arrived No response from company,"I ordered the 30X mag. loupe along with another combo 10/20 x loupe. The 10/20 got here fine but the PO destroyed the second pkg. When it arrived, rather than the jewelers loupe inside, I found a CELL PHONE. I tried to contact AMAZON.com, and could not find anywhere to contact Amazon. Then tried e-mailing the company and AMAZON, also called and left a message, with the company. I have been IGNORED totally on this matter. I am out the money and have no one to even lodge a complaint with. Will NEVER use this company OR AMAZON again!! If there was a rating LOWER than 1, I would give it to both!!Sandy"
2,Instructions,"I am a novice. I need some instructions as to how to use the loupe. I have the loupe, but don't know what I am looking for with regards to gems/stones"
5,You wont be disappointed in this item.,"We only sell new items. If your not 100% satisfied, with this or any item we sell, please contact us to correct any problem."
3,well...it a good price..but??,Well its a great price for this....i mean 3 bucks includes shipping...but??..the lens is about the size of a nickle...soooooooo..keep that in mind...
4,Very Pleased!,I was very pleased with the 30x jewlers loop. It was on time and intact. It works very well for what I need.
3,5x glass magnifier,"My loupe came with a little chip in the depth of the glass near its edge. As others noted, the magnification is closer to 5x and the glass diameter is less than an inch (21 mm as stated) of which only about half an inch near the center is useful: at the edges the image is distorted/stretched out. I was able to read the ring stamp though, something I wouldn't be able to do without this inexpensive implement."
5,nice loop for the money!,"Having never used a loop before, it took a bit of experimenting to get the hang of it. It works very well for what I need it too. The loop is well made. An especially good deal for the money. Delivery was very quick too."
5,Super Loupes,"I really like how easily this product performs. Also, it was quickly delivered from the business."
1,cheap chinese garbage,"I received it and it had many defects, so I sent it back. The worst defect was that it was not 30x magnification."
2,"Good, for the price","Definitely not the 30x its sold as. But as cheap stocking stuffers for the kids, pretty good. (Their eyesite is great, so 10x, which is what these seem to be, is perfect for them.)"
4,"Just what I needed , and cheap too!","Product is exactly as shown. I use the loop for indoor gardening to spot pests etc. The loop is perfect for that. Thanks for the deal, and the super fast shipment."
1,maybe 6x,This product is cheap enough but even though its not worth the money.I have a 10x and this does not even come close to the magnification of my 10x. Its more like 6x if that.People learn by their mistakes.Next time I will buy USA rather than products made in CHINA.
3,Magnifier,"Small and compact but is a little difficult to use. Magnifying is great when you figure out how to hold it, to view coins or gem stones. received in a timely manner."
4,Good buy for the money.,"I bought this to appraise some jewelry that has been passed down in the family. I had recently bought a ring for my wife, and while at the store the sales person handed me a Loupe to look at the stone, and I was very impressed with the quality of their loupe, so much so, that when I saw this one I realized that it was the same one. So I bought it. I'm very satisfied with the product. The LED generates a very bright, white light to give you excellent quality viewing."
3,Fair,"Good for the money. Plus: clear bright LED light. Cons: The magnification info is false. It is more likely 10x insted of 30x after I compared with several other magnifiers I hvae. I am disappointed b/ I already have a good 10x. BTW, the 20x loupe made by the same company is also no better than 10x. Buyer beaware."
2,Definatley NOT 30x magnifier,"While being an ok magnifier, this is most definatley NOT a 30x magnifier, its much more like 10x, so that being said I cannot give this a good review because the item is not as described.BEWARE, if you are looking for a 30x magnifier this is not for you, however, if a 10x will do than this would be a fine buy."
4,Takes some getting used to...,"Not the best optical glass, but it works. If the glass was of better quality, I would have given it a 5."
1,Absolutely worthless,"I should have known ""you get what you pay for"". This is not worth the powder it would take to blow it up. No clarity. I bought this hoping to be able to make out marks on pottery, jewelry, etc. I couldn't make out my own signature with this. A complete disappointment and waste of money."
1,Poor images,"This loupe is pretty useless, as only the center is not blurred, and even then the definition is not very good. More like a toy than a tool."
3,Is it really 30X?,"The lens does appear to be glass. Like other reviewers, I am also wondering whether this is 30X magnification. I'm having trouble focusing through it to view my jewelry, and it seems to me that I had an easier time looking through 10X when I was in the jewelry store. As a result, I'm ordering another magnifier that is both 10X and 20X and will compare those to this one and then amend this review. On another note, I should have looked here first for the 30X because I purchased the exact item, exact supplier, on Ebay and paid twice the amount as what it is selling for here on Amazon. Live and learn."
2,Piece of *@*#,"While I wanted to give it 0 Stars, but the metal housing is pretty sturdy.Too bad the optics are ridiculously poor. Seriously. I have 20/20 vision and most of the time I can just hold the object of interest closer to my face (like one would have to anyway to use the loupe) and can see the SAME DETAIL as looking through the loupe. While the loupe will SLIGHTLY magnify it, it is not even close to 10x.I read the reviews that said that it's around 10x, and I knew it wouldn't be even close to 30x, BUT I had NO IDEA it would be far below 10x.Do not buy."
3,Reasonable Price,"Reasonable price, especially if you misplace these as often as I do. I have older versions from other manufactures which seem to have more magnification with the same rateing."
5,Antiques when YOU are old.,Second time buyer here......You can actually see the marks on jewelry you purchase. Very great customer service. Always a follow-up. My grandson wants one. Guess I'll be purchasing another.. Love it!
2,"3X, NOT 30X.","This is NOT 30X, it is 3X. I have a very good 16X for my coin collection and it magnify's about 5 X bigger than this one.I would say it is more like 3X and somebody moved the zero over one.30X is printed on the metal. This is wrong. There is no way this is 30X. I'm an engineer and know what I'm talking about. This is 3X with a metal printing stamp mistake.That said, the thing is so cheap that it's not worth returning. I would have given it 1 star, but it's a good 3X loop... so 2 stars."
2,maybe 5 times magnifier!,"It's not a 30x magnifier.maybe a 5 one.of course this is cheap but i don't know if this will be worthwhile,since u expect a 30x and comes with a 5x one."
2,Still has not arrived,"Ordered item over a month ago, still have not received it. Scheduled to arrive withing a 3 week window, which I am 1 week into at this time. No tracking info provided."
4,Wonderful for a Hobbyist,"This item is nearly perfect. It's easy to hold, has a nice lanyard hole, and swivels with the perfect amount of resistance.The only problem, and it's very slight, is that mine has a very slight chip in the glass. It's not a problem for me, however, because I'm a hobbyist and don't need a professional-grade loupe and this one is perfect for my needs."
2,Other reviewers are dead on..,"This is definitely NOT 30x. I have a cheap magnifying glass that's 2x and 5x, and in comparison, this seems to be somewhere between 7x and 10x. It works, but I wouldn't have wasted my time if I knew it definitely wasn't 30x!"
1,tiny little thing,"I just got mine today. For the price I paid for it there are others much better. It's got MAYBE a 1/2 inch view area and the magnification is about 1/3 of what they claim. I like the 3 lens Carson I got today much better. However if you're looking for a very small decent power magnifier with a strong protector this isn't bad. the casing you see in the picture to hide the lens in is metal and pretty strong but, it's open on both sides so it's still not spectacular."
5,Excellent Product,"This is an outstanding pair of binoculars for the price. They have excellent clarity, are well made, and are backed by the unbeatable Vortex warranty. I purchased these as a gift and am probably going to get a pair for myself as they are the best quality optics I have found for the money. You won't be disappointed."
4,my first set of binoculars,"Binoculars seems pretty fine, althought I havent try it on high humidity enviroment. Vortex is a well known brand so I expect no problems.Very good equipment for the price, ideal for hobbyists or birdwatchers, of solid materials and quality, a recommended purchase.There are better teams, but if this is your first computer and you don't want to spend much is good option."
5,Excellent Purchase,"I received the book a few days after ordering it. the seller had stated the book was in GOOD condition. The book was in EXCELLENT condition. I was pleasantly surprised with the condition of the book being under rated as well as the time in which I received the book and mostly the price. I once again have the favorite book of my daughter, and I've had to read it to her every night since giving it to her for her birthday. She's 35 years old. (LOL)"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The first of a spin-off series of Ludlum's, done with another writer. The protagonist here is a doctor, but he is also secretly a spy for an ultra-clandestine spook type group in the USA.The doctor's wife is involved in looking into a mysterious ebola sort of situation, and the doctor is tasked to help out, under a supposedly plausible cover, to see what is going on."
3,Not as good as the earlier stuff,"I keep looking for something like the Matlock Paper or the Gemini Contenders, but this had all the traditional Ludlum themes: beautiful women, seemingly all powerful villians, and hero who gets most of the breaks."
2,An example of the law of diminishing returns,"Ludlum has written an improbable number of books most of which range from excellent to good. This is not the case in The Hades Factor which is too predictable and bland. In addition, it does not have the minimum of plausibility needed to make a book interesting: spreading a deadly virus in order to profit by selling its cure is too horrific, impractical, ridiculous and downright stupid. You will not miss much by not reading this book."
3,my review,"An american businessman decides he wants to infect the world with a rare virus to which he is the only one to have an antidote. He just calls it ""good business""...Although this subject of virus spreading has already been taken by other authors, this time the plot centers on the objective of this businessman, that is: to make more money.The plot is entertaining throughout, and although you can guess at the ending, you cannot tell how it will evolve. The characters are also well presented and very real.In all, it is a good easy reading. And, we can see it will be the beginning of a new series by these authors?"
3,Needs more research before writing,"I have been a fan of Robert Ludlum since the Scarlatti Inheritance was published. I love the conspiracy ideas, the paranoia. I was excited to see The Hades Factor. As a physician, though, I was disappointed in the book's medical scenes and explanations: completely implausable. I did enjoy the plotting; the book is like a tornado the way it moves. It's a meaningless bit of froth, but sometimes that's what one needs. I was looking for more, though, and hopefully Ludlum and Lynds will get the details of their physician protagonist right."
4,"New to Ludlum, fan of Lynds","I enjoyed this one! The pace kept the pages turning. While the plot wasn't necessarily original, the characters were interesting (Marty with his 'Zounds!' and mild autism). I do like biological terror books and hadn't read one in a long time, so this fit the bill. Plus, she mercifully didn't throw the remaining couple together at the end. I look forward to more books in the series."
4,Is This Possible?,"I haven't listened to many of Ludlum's books yet but would buy more after this one. The basic premise of unleashing a deadly virus on humans has been done before however, when you learn how it's being done and why you'll wonder if it's a reality!"
2,Asperger syndrome ? I think not.,"I think that someone should have checked out the basic characteristics of Asperger's in DSM IV. The only characteristics they got right were the high intelligence factor and the social anxiety. Marty's ""unmedicated"" manic behavior more strongly suggests a Bi-Polar ""diagnosis"". Hos ability to perceive the feelings and viewpoints of others is quite admirable, especially since one of the things that folks with Asperger's often need is lots of help with is the ability to take another person's perspective. (Check out "" Theory of Mind"").Generally , I was very disappointed by this book. Having been an avid Ludlom reader in the 70's, I found this book to lack the seemingly authentic research and the intricately woven and believable plot twists and turns of his earlier solo work. This book ""felt"" way too contrived. Its sad that his name is on this ""Ludlom"" work."
1,Dull & offensive,"Very surprised at how dull and poorly written I found this book to be. Disappointed --- Ludlum's been entertaining in the past.Also, the constant racist stereotyping of the antagonist ""Arab"" was appalling and very offensive. For shame...Can't recommend at all."
2,Hades,"The paperback is abridged so it has alot less of the usual Ludlum detail. Character devlopment is superficial and they are predicatable. As usual, the heroes are nearly superhuman in reacting to crisis situations, as compared to the crooks who always seem to bungle. The scene in Iraq is a good example - a crew of Republic Guards with automatic weapons confront our hero in an alley and cannot take him out! Save your time and money."
2,Disappointed with poor writing.,"I should have read the review (see other reviews here in web site) by David S. Rose. I agree with him that this is a poor performance relative to what we'd expect from a pure Ludlum. After the first 24 pages, I had had enough and stopped reading! The sophomoric writing made it too painful to go on. Why would such a good author (Ludlum) allow this to be published?"
2,Flat 2.5 stars,"This is my first Ludlum book, and I'm very disappointed in it. I expected more from him, yet this was dry and unemotional. There was no real emotion over the death of a loved one and many of the characters were unnecessary for plot purposes. In fact, some plots were left dangling, and some characters, who seemed to important in the beginning, disappeared until the very end. I'm hesitant to read the next book in the Covert-One series. Maybe I should go back and try his older ones, instead."
1,Pale version of Clancy,"I have read this and it is earily similar to other tales of deliberately introduced viral plagues such as that of Tom Clancy and Robin Cook. However, the excruciatingly plodding and predictable plot and straining of credibility to the breaking point render it painful to read. Examples: Erasing all the data on one topic in all the computers in research centers around the world in 2 hours. Has not the author heard of tape or disk backup? Cutting out a page in a lab notebook to surrepticiously remove data without detection. Hello, all the lab notebooks that I am familiar with have prenumbered pages."
2,Poorly read,"This is not so much a review of the book as a review of the audio. I could not even get through the 1st CD. Mr. Campanella reads too fast and runs his words together. I could not understand much of what he was saying, so I couldn't listen to it."
1,how does something this bad get published?,"Of course the answer is having Robert Ludlum's name associated with it. I am a long time Ludlum fan but this book is poorly written. Words are misused, the dialogue is clumsy and flat, there is an obvious attempt to substitute inappropriate multisyllabic words for decent writing. Don't waste your time with this."
4,Excellent diversion.,"In Robert Ludlum's ""The Hades Factor,"" the improbably handsome, intelligent, and talented Lt. Col. Jon Smith, M.D. returns from a conference to find his similarly spectacular fiancée dying of a new, lethal virus she had been working to identify at their laboratory at USAMRIID. A warning from a friend and former FBI agent tells him to run for his life. He doesn't; he is determined to find out what killed her, and why.The story is gripping and suspenseful. Of course the bad guys are diabolical and powerful beyond reason, and the good guys resourceful beyond credulity. That's part of the deal with this kind of book. It's good entertainment, straining the limits of belief just enough to be a fun read while not crossing the line into complete silliness.The audiotape version is well-read, and I highly recommend it for listening to in the car during a trip or commute."
2,Meh,"It works, but it really hurts my bichon when I try using it on her. It isn't well made. I wouldn't recommend this."
5,dematting rake is great,"My new dematting rake works great on my long haired, mixed breed dog. I'm hoping to go to the groomer less often. Soon she will lose her winter coat. That will be the true test. It seems to be the right size and have blades to cut through mats."
2,Sorry,I don't like this. It's too big. I'm scarred to use this as I might hurt my little one. I even looked on youtube and the web for instructions. Wish someone would post a video.
5,Forget the Dogs - Think Horses,"I have Draft horses with huge very thick manes and tails, this is the only product that I have found that really works. I've spent lots of money with other combs, thinners and razors. This really thins and leaves the edges looking natural, not cut! It's easy on the horses too."
1,Stay Away,Not a very good DVD. No depth at all. I think ESPN gives you better highlights than this DVD does. What a rush job.No realtime highlights or anything. Just boring and not much thought. Very disappointed.
3,These are NOT reviews!,"First of all, could someone from Amazon PLEASE edit out the preceding posts (including mine of course). Only one even mentions the DVD as if he really saw it. I have not yet, and I came here hoping to get some insight on whether it's worth buying. Instead, I end up in a friggin sports forum that has NOTHING to do with the DVD.Secondly, would someone who has actually seen the DVD PLEASE write a decent in-depth review. I don't feel like doling out $20 for a 60-minute commercial if that's all it's going to be.Thank you for your support!"
3,"Readably formatted, but none of the text's important visual features","This is a review of the formatting of this edition rather than of Sterne's text.It would make sense to pay money for a good Kindle edition of Tristram Shandy, because the image-free public domain text lacks the features that make this novel so remarkable and fresh. Sterne played extensively with eighteenth-century bookmaking techniques, including, famously, a black page and a marbled page.You should be able to see the black page right before Book I, Chapter XIII, which should come through in any sample you send to your Kindle.But these pages are just the start: Sterne included woodcut Greek epigraphs, Gothic blackletter emphasis, and any number of typographical eccentricities the eighteenth-century pamphlet-reader would have learned to recognize and appreciate.This is a case where you are better off avoiding the 89 expenditure and looking for a handsome hardcover at your local library."
4,Nice neat package for kids game,"I bought this for my 5yr old son and he loves it. I thought the smaller size would be ideal to reduce clutter plus it's great that it zips up, so if pieces get loose they don't get lost."
3,"There are better for less,","While I have no doubt that It's a fine memory card, it's pretty much the same as any other MMC memory card in existence, lots of portable devices and cameras us mmc memory. You can find they come in sizes of up to 512megs nowadays. Either get the same thing for a much lower price or go for broke and get 2 or 3 times the bang (ammount of memory) for your buck in this same store."
1,"Look Ma...I took some photos of the ""Golden Gate"" that look like my #*#&","This book SUCKS...Thank goodness I did not pay $50.00 + for this. I am disabled with multiple scelrosis and I collect different items on the Golden Gate Bridge. My ""love affair"" with ""The Bridge"" quickly turned to BEYOND DISAPOINTMENT & RAGE!!! Here are some book titles Mr.RM should of used - 'GOLDEN GATE SKY', 'GOLDEN GATE NIGHT', GOLDEN GATE CLOUDS, GOLDEN GATE SOMETIMES NOT AT ALL...SHAME ON YOU :(."
1,Porch Photography,"What a disappointment, and what amateur uninteresting photos from the author's porch in the Oakland Hills (I presume). All you need is a wide angle lens, a tripod and some 35mm film. Take a picture every week or so, vary the time of day and then publish a book. Ca ching! He must be a layed-off dot.commer.Being born, raised and schooled in San Francisco, I feel cheated. Hopefully no tourists will see it. They may stay home."
1,Did very little for me,"This book did very little for me. More than being a study of the Golden Gate, it's a study of weather formations. If you enjoy looking at clouds, the sun and sky you may enjoy this book. I on the other hand found it sterile, repetive and somewhat pointless. Further, it's all too easy to simply set up a camera, never move it and just press the shutter release periodically. Where's the artistry in that? There's no question that Misrach had a nice view from his front porch, but does it really merit a book?The jacket text is corny and pretentious."
5,Fabulous food layouts and color photos,"It's worth buying this book just for the wonderful photographs. Not only is there a complete listing of exotic ingredients such as fruits, vegetables and spices, there is a nice assortment of recipes to choose from. This is definitely one of my favorite Caribbean books. If you like this book, you will love Angela Spenceley's latest book ""A Taste of the Caribbean"" featuring hundreds of tidbits about exotic fruits, vegetables and other tropical ingredients. This complete A-Z Caribbean cookbook is a valuable addition to any good cookbook library."
3,Not as described,"I ordered this helmet and I recieved the red color one and it did not have a dial-fit retention system nor a rear LED safety light. It didn't have rear exhaust ports either. All of the openings are on top which is fine with me but it is not as described. The plastic covering for the foam is not even well glued on. However, it's good enough for the price. I'm gonna have to send it back because there is no support for the back of my head to keep the helmet from sliding backwards. I have a pretty good size head for a woman (23in./61cm)and the helmet fits pretty well. I just need that dial-fit retention system to keep the helmet in place."
1,"When something goes wrong, you are SOL","I got one of these (an AVN 50D to be exact) with my new Toyota 4Runner. It half works -- it will show a map of where I am driving -- but all the navigation and route stuff is disabled, all the buttons gray.This was when I discovered that there is absolutely no customer support for the Eclipse products. No trouble shooting guides, and their website just sends you to various email addresses in Japan, none of which will ever respond to your questions.I would not buy an Eclipse product again after this experience."
2,Poor design,"Probably worth rather less than the low I paid for the 5 blades I bought. Handle broke on first use. Jury rigged it so that I can get some use from it.Blade is sharp, at least so far, but why not put teeth on both sides as is normal? That way you double the use of the implement.All in all, I would hesitate to buy anything else from JW Pet Company."
5,8 Simple Rules,"Great book...laughed out loud, sometimes with people staring at me like I was crazy. Very entertaining!!! More please!"
2,"""8 Simple rules"" - is it helpful","This is a good book to read on a train, but if you are looking for help in guiding you with communication help, keep searching..."
5,Three fold.,"I thought this book had three levels to it. Firstly informative for beleaguered parents. Secondly hilarious to the extent of major coughing fits. Thirdly I think it is a reassuring boost to all singletons who have felt sad at not having a familiy, that they are not missing anything.Bravo Bruce on every count, it ticks all the boxes."
4,To Walk Through Walls,"After reading the first chapter of this work, I simply HAD to get the book. Mr. Hunt draws the reader in immediately making you try to solve the mystery. Generally, novels in an historical setting are not my cup of tea, but this book hooked me from the beginning. There are several ""mysteries"" for the reader to ponder during the course of this book. A couple I was able to figure out in fairly short order, but the author did leave a couple of very good surprises for the ending. My only disappointment was the book was not longer. I look forward to more works by Mr. Hunt."
4,good treatment of modern methods,Dudewicz and Mishra provide a good treatment of mathematical statistics as it was in 1988. It is unique in its coverage of computational methods and software and the emerging area of expert systems. I was pleased to see coverage of influence functions including some of my work. This book also provides a good mix of theory and application.
2,Damaged unit,"I received the DELTA 50-760 dust collector today via UPS. When I opened the box, the main unit of the dust collector was dented. I continued the assembly to see if the dent would cause an issue. I also noted that the frame of the unit was dented and the grey paint was cracked and peeling due to impact. Then I noticed that the motor housing was smashed in and the blower fan would not turn. I was able to remove the motor housing, hammer out the dents and get the dust collector to work. It is a heavy item, but it should have been packaged and shipped more carefully. If returning it was easy (and if I didn't need this item immediately), I would return the item for an exchange. Hopefully the machine does not experience problems in the future due to the state it arrived.After getting the unit working, it ran quieter than expected and produced good suction. Will update review later after using it for a while."
5,Good Purchase!,"Does a great job at sucking the saw dust up and filtering it out. At first, it was blowing a 15-amp fuse, but I don't know if it was that or if it was because the hose was clogged with sawdust. After I cleared the clog, it seemed ti work a lot better. :)For the price, I don't think it can be beat. Zero damaged during shipment, everything went together great, and was happy I bought it."
3,Useful,"The unit I received was damaged (appears Delta's packaging is inadequate) but it a new unit was quickly provided.The unit is quiet for a dust collector and has adequate power for most of my shop tools. The 15"" planer seems to be pushing the capacity of this unit, but the tablesaw, jointer, bandsaw and various sanders are handled fine.The clear bags are nice in that it makes it simple to determine when a bag needs to be emptied. However, the bags are a little awkward to remove and install. I seem to end up with a facefull of sawdust every time I change bags.The design is, not surprisingly, a bit top-heavy. I expected this given that the motor, the heaviest part of this DC, is mounted so high. I've not had any problems with the unit tipping over or anything drastic like that, but it is top-heavy.Overall, I feel this is a good lower-cost, single-stage dust collector. There are much better dust collectors available, but not at this price."
3,Damaged but usable,"The Delta 50-760 unit was superficially damaged when received. The vacuum housing was buckled as if it had been hit with a fork lift, but not so severely that any rotating parts contacted it. Having read another reviewer's report of a similar experience, I figured I got the unit he returned. He apparently was then sent another damaged but usable unit and elected to keep it. I decided to just keep the unit I received. Aside from that the unit works fine."
1,Delta 50-760 Dust Collector Arrived Broke,"It gets 1 star because it arrived damaged and unusable. The motor cooling shroud was crushed . Poor packaging. They put plenty of padding over the bag and box containing wheels but none over the motor !Also, It appears I'm not the first as it seems to have been returned before. Shame on amazon .Otherwise it seems to be a great unit . I'll report after its all fixed.Now if I can get a part without going thru the hastle of returning the whole thing. Delta was no help. Now its Amazons turn."
2,Junk,"I've had this unit for abour 6 months now and am not particularly happy with it. When it works it's ok, but in the short time I've had it the bracket that holds the dust bag up had broke, and after getting a replacement on ($15) appears to on the verge of breaking again. Also, the dust bag does not seat well in the opening and leaks fine particles of sawdust. Most recently, the motor stalls when I attempt to power it up and it appears the starter needs to be replace. These things are not that complecated and there should be a lot of good ones out there. This just isn't one one them. I'm going to sell this one and get another brand."
1,Piece of junk out of the box,"I have many Delta tools in my shop, but was very disappointed in this one right out of box. First, the drying agent pouch has ripped open and everything was covered with white powder - what a mess. Second, the assembly instructions state that the only tools necessary are a scredriver and a 12mm wrench. The first step is to use a THIN 14mm open-end wrench. How many of Delta's customers have this tool? Give me a break - I have a $600 Craftsman set and not this tool. I had to buy a needle-nose ViseGrip just to put the casters on. CHEAP! CHEAP! CHEAP! Other instructions show the incorrect piece or are clearly written for a different tool. If the thing wasn't so heavy, I would have packed it up and returned it. I don't even know yet if it sucks sawdust, but I certainly know that Delta sucks."
4,Good Platform for Upgrades Without Compromising Space,"Length:: 2:46 MinsLike sleeping enough after working out, dust collection is often overlooked in woodworking. Mess takers are just as important as the mess makers in your shop. There are quite a few very similarly equipped dust collectors in the same category as the Delta 50-760. I chose this model for my own needs based on a combination of brand reputation, specifications and upgradability.To get 5 stars for me would be better fit (casters, stand, inlet port) and a more useful hose, all of which are detailed in the video.For more videos and information on upgrading this dust collector, please check out my profile and visit my blog. Thanks."
4,Two big bags of sawdust later...,"Before purchasing this machine, I read a magazine review which suggested a 2hp+ cyclone collector was necessary if connected to ductwork and multiple machines. In the end, I couldn't justify the expense (almost $1000) and decided to try the Delta. I'm very glad I did. I've run 4"" duct with blast gates to four machines - this machine captures ALL the dust and chips from the jointer and planer, and most from the router table. Collection from the contractor saw is only fair, but I can't blame that on the dust collector.Shipping was fast, packaging was fine, and the included 1 micron bags are great. If you're used to an industrial cyclone dust collector, this may not be enough machine for you. If you're like me and your previous dust collection system involved a dustpan and broom, you'll be very happy with this machine."
4,Good product,"Unlike some of the others here, I seem to have got lucky in the fact that the motor was not damaged (Although I can clearly see that the package design leaves a lot to be desired.)I didn't have much trouble putting this unit together, I skipped the instructions on everything but the bag attachment (a small problem for some of the reviewers here) I went with the snap ring option, instead of the metal strap, with a little finesse the ring slid in easily and will be easily repeatable.The price was right and the unit performs well. The motor, and the damage that may happen during shipping, are the only crap shoot with this product, and the reason it is missing a 5th star."
5,Great machine but packaging needs improvement.,"This is my first experience with a dust collector and I am very pleased with the performance... it's much much better than using a shop vac! I was very disapointed when I pulled the dust collector out of the box and found four dents in the main shroud! Plus the leg/wheel assembly made of tubing was bent. All probably due to inferior packaging design and careless warehouse/delivery men. I probably could have lived with the dents and the bent wheel/leg assembly but I decided to contact Amazon to get replacement parts. My hats off to Amazon, in a few days, I had a whole brand new repplacement DC! The exchange was so easy!"
5,Does a great job.,This is working great for my small shop. The one thing I didn't take into account was its height. It's too tall for me to easily move around my basement due to overhead storage and ductwork. So I'll probably use it as more of a stationary unit than a mobile one.
4,Better then expected,"I was skeptical when I ordered this dust collector because of some of the reviews I read with regards to the difficulty of assembly. I decided to take advantage of a good price on Amazon and take my chances. I was pleasantly surprised when after about 20 minutes I had the whole thing assembled and working. I found the cloth lined ring that is used for the plastic and filter bags very easy to install. It did not take 2 people to assemble it, I did it without any help. As far as the dust collector goes I have only had it a short time but am very please with it so far. As many people have written, I can't believe I waited this long to get one. The power of the unit is very good and is much quieter than my shop vac. I don't feel the need to wear headphones when using it. I would recommend this product."
2,It may suck up dust but the bag attachment is a real pain,"I read a lot about this item and it appeared that it was really the one to own. So I bought it. It all went together well, until it was time to attach the bag to catch the dust. Total pain, very frustrating. I think this will be the last Detla tool I buy. Sorry, I was I just have no patience for things that are a real pain. Everytime I have to change it, it will be a hassle. Delta you should have made this easy."
3,1 micron bag,"This top bag does not seal with the cloth covered ring good enough to stop the quote "" 1 micron"" of dust. This needs to be corrected with different way to seal this bag to the unit. Customer service did agree to send a new bag, however I doubt this will solve the problem."
3,Good Performance But Design Problems,"The performance of the unit is very good but it has one fatal flaw that I wish I had noticed before buying. Neither of the two methods provided to hold the plastic bag in place are satisfactory. The steel strap can't be adjusted so as to provide a tight seal without the use of duct tape. The felt covered spring steel hoop seals well but makes it very difficult to empty the bag without destroying it. I am not intersted in purchasing a bunch of single use heavy plastic bags. It is very difficult for one person to mount the bag by himself using either method. A helper or two, a large roll of duct tape and a few bungee cords is recommended. I am planning on replacing the plastic bag with some type of collection barrel and a sleeve made of vinyl in order to make it more convenient to use."
1,Another with a damaged one!,"Price was right and actually arrived before due date. Motor had damage that was not caused by shipping( Styrofoam was pristene)and unit was completely unusable. Amazon is shipping out a replacement, but with so many reviews complaining about damaged units, They need to communicate with Delta regarding this issue."
5,This thing SUCKS!,"and that's what it's supposed to do. Great unit. great results. little issue with the packaging. not sure if that's a Delta issue or an Amazon issue. the cage covering the motor cooling fan was dented in the first time, enough to send back as it seemed to have affected the motor. second was dented as well, but motor spun correctly so I just banged it out. in use, it's fantastic."
1,Product Damaged - box in excellent condition,"Collector arrived with damage to the motor shroud, scratches and dents were also in evidence elsewhere on the unit. The collector was advertised as new but I believe this one was returned by some other dissatisfied customer. Assembled the collector with dust intake on the bottom motor on top, motor had a noticeable clunk when stopping. Reassembled with dust intake on the top and motor on the bottom. Unit would not start and blew the circuit breaker. Delta has advised I take unit to service center - fortunately there is one nearby - hassle I should not have to have. New Product? Forced to give 1 star."
3,Good value and works as advertised,"Overall, I am satisfied with this DC. It has good suction (thru a 10 ft. 4"" hose to an enclosed table saw) and the noise level is acceptable. It does a better job with the jointer and thickness planer than the TS. It was one that arrived with minor damage from shipping/packaging. Had to reshape the fan shroud and replace the start-up capacitor (Delta supplied the part) to get it to run. The fan shroud is not an available part, or that would have been replaced as well. Running 120V on a 20 Amp circuit as start-up trips breakers on anything less than 20 Amp. Got a fair number of hours in the past three months with it, and am glad it has a 5 year warranty."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I just purchased a Delta 50-760 Dust Collector. The box looked fine but when I opened it I discovered the fan housing was bent in, preventing the fan from operating. I banged it out with a hammer so it would work. There was more damage to the machine but it doesn't interfere with the operation. When I called Delta I was advised it wasn't their problem and that I should take it up with the shipping company. I won't be buying any more Delta equipment and I hope losing a customer was worth the $5 part they could have sent me."
2,Delta 50-760,This is the second Delta 50-760 I ordered. The first one would not run ! I returned it and ordered the second one which was damaged in shipment ! The box wasn't damaged much at all but the motor cover end cap was dented in against the cooling fan and I had to remove the cover from the motor and hammer it out so it would not rub the cooling fan. The main impeller housing was also bent but did not cause any problems other than the paint peeling off next to the bent area on both the top and bottom of the housing. I would have thought Delta would have beef up the packaging by now to keep these damage problems from happening. Not very happy with Delta and their poor quality control and packaging problems. Other than that the unit seems to work as it should now. I am happy to say Amazon took care of returning the first unit so purchasing from Amazon is a good thing in case you do have problems. Their customer service was really good.
2,Works ... but quality is in question,"I ordered this having first read others' reviews. A few had mentioned dents/etc right out of the box, with no damage to box or styrofoam. I fall into this category. The motor fan cover was dented to the point where the motor would not spin freely. The metal dust shroud also had a dent... but the box was perfect. It had to have happened at the factory. I took off the fan shroud and repaired it. I must say that it was shipped incredibly fast, reasonable to assemble, and really moves some air. It is a bit louder than I expected. I expect more from a new product, but as long as nothing else goes wrong - I think it will be OK."
5,Works Perfect,"Great quality cord. Thick coating to make it last through the years, good solid heads, all the pins are strait, and the signal is good too. Great purchase"
4,The revolving door,"Just the way Murnau shoots doors -- especially the Hotel Atlantic's revolving door -- makes this film worth watching. The title in German translates as ""The Last Man"" and a revolving door is a perfect metaphor for the story of a proud worker made expendable by his old age. It is really powerful as an image of the wheel of fate, or of time passing, and could also be seen as a metaphor for the movie camera itself. There are several shots where the spinning glass creates a fragmenting, kaleidoscope effect, especially in the doorman's drunken fantasy of superhuman perfection as a porter. Later we see the dejected man hiding behind the bathroom door in his new position as a washroom attendant and, after the shame of his demotion is revealed to his family, he is unable even to gain entry through the front door of his own home without ringing the bell and waiting in disgrace. My advice: ignore the tacked-on feel-good ending and get into the visual poetry of the acting and cinematography."
3,Much Ado About Nothing,"The Last Laugh (Der Letzte Mann) is a story about an elderly man (Emil Jannings) who works at the Atlantic hotel. He is proud of his job, saluting guests at the door and hailing taxis for them. However, his manager soon realizes that the man tires easily and might be better suited for another position. He informs the man, who completely falls apart. His new job is to work as a bathroom attendant, but there is no prestige and the man is embarassed.The action in the beginning is melodramatic to the point of being laughable in some places. Why is this man so concerned over losing his position? Instead of reacting like someone who is being shifted to an easier job, he goes into a catatonic state as if he were handed a death sentence.The ending is satisfying to a degree, but it takes more than half of the film to get to that point. Until then, this is much ado about nothing."
3,Well made historical curio,"As a fossil from the silent era, this is an important film. Murnau is innovative and displays his usual poetic visual style to tell this story of a doorman who is demoted to latrine worker (and notice how so many German films are about humiliation?). Silent film lovers and film historians should not miss it. The rest of us may find it a bit creaky and dusty. Five minutes of plot are dragged out interminably. Jannings overacts, as usual. The new score on the Kino edition (which has the best film print) was distracting to me and sounded ponderous."
2,So so movie with inadequate storyline,Look people! The damn movie's about a guy getting demoted from doorman to sinkroom attendant. So what!?! This isn't Metropolis or Gone With The Wind as far as a great story. The overated camera techniques look archaic and the only impressive bit is the way the big city set is created just on a UFA studio-backlot. I bought this film on KIno DVD and felt financially ripped off upon seeing it.
1,Ineffective,"Got this bottle with my critter trail hamster cage. Never squeezed it, of course, and it drips constantly, soaking the hamster's bedding. But why wouldn't it? It's the weight of water pushing down onto an open hole, albeit small. Not good, looking to buy an alternative."
1,don't bother,"This bottle drips all the time. It came with a crittertrail home that I used for my dwarf hamster, and I bought one of the water bottles with the ball at the end, because it dripped so badly that it made my hamster's bedding soaking wet in two days. It's also really hard to take off the plastic tip to refill it."
1,Absolutely Not Worth the Money,"If you are a bowler that is average to above average, this DVD is a waste of your money. There is nothing in this DVD that you probably don't already know and nothing that will ""take you to the next level"". Every thing is very elementary and the entire DVD is poorly produced."
4,Diver Dan,What else can I say...it's Diver Dan!!!!! Great for local TV for young NYC kids in the early 60's.
2,Creepy and creaky,"Yikes, This show gave me the willies when I was a little kid and it is even worse now. It looks cheap, dark, and oppressive. The puppet fish used to give me nightmares with their flapping mouths."
2,"Good ideas, but poorly executed sf novel.","This early novel by MacDonald is chock full of great sf ideas, as much as any sf book of the early 50's. Unfortunately it is a real let-down when compared to MacDonald's great suspense novels of the same period, like ""The Brass Cupcake"" and ""Judge Me Not"". With those two novels MacDonald burst forth on the paperback original market in 1950, after his apprenticeship in the pulp magazines, as a fully developed talent, fully as great a writer from the get-go as he ever would be. Unfortunately, ""Wine of the Dreamers"", while it succeeds for its ideas, is a dud with respect to execution. It is telegraphed, some of the key scenes happen off stage, it reads like an outline for a novel that never actually got written. Read ""Judge Me Not"" if you want great early MacDonald, and read ""Bright Orange for the Shroud"" if you want MacDonald the greatest he ever got."
4,Very interesting attempt to explain turmoil in the world.,Tries to account for the things most would ordinarily attribute to the devil. Fun reading. One of only a couple science fiction works of John D. McDonald. Also see Ballroom of the Skies.
5,Great All-in-One printer!,"The new Canon was purchased for our desktop after I had trouble with our HP psc 1315v All-in-One software after a IE security update and moved it to my wifes laptop where it continues to work. The Canon is approx 1"" taller and wider and about 5"" deeper than the HP but the software features and print quality blow the HP away.This is a GREAT unit!"
5,Canon Pixma MP600 All-In-One Photo Printer.,"I am well pleased with the transactlion and the product. The Printer arrived in good shape, and it works just fine. It was a replacement for one just like it that went bad on me. It was a used printer, but was in excellent condition. I would recomment this seller to anyone."
1,Suddenly died,"This printer worked very well for a year or so, then started giving me an 'incorrect printhead' error, despite the fact that I was still using the printhead the printer arrived with. On googling this problem I encountered a suggestion that I replace the printhead, which I did at a cost of 70. On fitting the new printhead the computer has completely died and won't even give me a green 'on' light. I have tried different power supplies/changing the fuse etc. but on googling 'MP 600 dead' I realise this is a fairly standard feature of this printer. I can't even get someone to look at it because the nearest repair centre is in Surrey, hundreds of miles from where I live. Very surprised by the 4 star average review, but on reading the most recent reviews it seems that the printer racked up a lot of positives before the printers started dying."
3,Printer failed before 2 years passed.,"Hello all - just thought people would want to know that after less than 2 years, my Canon MP600 has failed. My computer stopped recognizing it suddenly and it won't reinstall. I have tested a new cable just in case that was the issue. I like Canon products, but you might want to consider an extended warranty if it looks at all affordable. I had no other problems with this printer -- it works great scanning, printing and card reader."
2,Bad Print Heads on this model,"I too own this printer and apparently there is a problem with the print head on this model. I have the same problem as many of you, it won't recognize the yellow cartridge. It only took about thirty days for this error to start popping up. I was going to get a new print head, but after reading everyone's review, I am just going to trash it and and accept it as a lesson learned.For me, it is the end of the road for Canon. I was an HP person and someone talked me into this one. I am going back to HP."
2,"Tempermental machine, but lovely when it works","Having lived with this machine for over a year I have come to love and hate it. When it prints, the output is impressive in both B&W; and color. When it prints is the catch.It has a very bad habit of not recognizing ink cartridges, even ones used just milliseconds before on a previous print job. It also has issues recognizing paper in the same peculiar fashion.If you have the patience of a Zen master, you will find the MP600 quite rewarding. If not, you're quite likely to re-enact a scene from the movie Office Space: ""PC Load Letter, WTF?!"""
5,Perfect,"It is the perfect printer i have bought ever, I got no problems since i bought it ""5 months ago"". It is great.."
1,Also getting U150 Error,"I keep getting U150 error message - the following ink tank cannot be recognized. This is the second set of cartridges, both times it was magenta, and the cartridge is 2/3 full. Once the error comes up, printer is useless."
1,U150 problem,I am having the U150 problem with the yellow ink cartridge also. Avoid this printer. What a waste of money.
2,Ink tank errors!,"I have had this printer for about 90 days now. While the functionality is nice WHEN IT'S WORKING, I find it incredibly annoying to deal with the perpetual ink tank error messages. As so many others have mentioned, there seems to be a glitch with these models with ink tanks being unrecognized which halts all printing. It's always the yellow which is not recognized. It is the original tank.I am contacting technical support and hope they will make this right."
2,Not Recommended.,"I've had this printer for 5 months. It worked fine for 3 months. Now, all it will do is tell me the Canon black cartridge cannot be recognized, even though it is almost full of ink. Canon does not even list this model on it's tech support website, and troubleshooting gives no helpful information.I have removed and re-installed the cartridge a dozen times....the light comes on momentarily, but when I try to print, scan, or copy, it goes out and again I get the ""can't recognize the cartridge"" notice. Canon charges ten bucks for support. Bad deal."
1,Will never buy another canon product agian,"I have owned this printer approx. 18 months. I use it lightly for home use. It still has the original ink tanks. The other day it said I had a paper jam. There is no paper jam. Canon suggests that I either bring it to a repair center, ( I called they want around $100.00 ) or buy a new printer at a ten percent discount. HA HA HA HA HAI would recommend staying away from canon products completely."
5,Elegant!,"I bought this to replace an Epsom printer that refused to print accurate color, and an old Canon scanner. I am very, very pleased! It looks terrific (my daughter said, ""Wow, cool new printer!""). Set up was easy. And the printing is fast and absolutely beautiful, even in draft mode. Better yet, the cartridges are much cheaper than my Epson ones. Scanning is easy and good, too. I don't use fax, so can't rate that function.Overall, I am thrilled with this printer. It was well worth the $180."
4,"Good buy, no problems","Was hoping to recieve it before the weekday but it came 2 days later than what I hoped for, but it was still delievered within the stated period so no big problems. Good buy and great price would shop here again."
2,Full Ink Cartridge not recognized by new printer,"I bought my MP600 about a month ago. For no apparent reason the printer has stopped recognizing the full yellow ink cartridge. I insert & reinsert multiple times and about 10% of the time I can get the printer to recognize the cartridge. Come on! I shouldn't have to fiddle with my printer like this after only 30 days! I'm very disappointed with this problem. However, when it does work, I do like the quality and speed. Therefore I'm torn if I would invest in a Canon in the future. Good quality printing, however unrealiable printer."
5,Great printer,"This is the best photo printer i have ever seen for under $150.00. The print quality is amazing, the scanner quality is great, and the ink usage is unbelievable. I have printed about 30 8 1/2 X 11 photos and about 75 4x6 before i had to change 2 of the colors. I printed about 25 more 4x6 before i had to change the third color. The black is still about half full after all that. It is very quiet even without the noise reduction feature. It prints a full color 8x10 in high quality in about 15-20 seconds. This is by far the best printer i have ever used."
5,Canon Printer,Excellent printer. Photo quality exceptional and speed great. Far exceeds the old Lexmark printer I was using.
1,Not worth it,"We had this printer for barely 3 years. It worked fine for most of that time, but simply stopped functioning last week. We're disgusted with Canon and will buy another brand next time."
1,worst printer ever,i bought this printer couple years agoi barely used itcouple of months ago i tried to turn it onand it wouldn't workafter i unplugged it couple of times it finally turn onbut the printer never workedit showed on the screen that there was an errori called canon to see if they could help me but they told me that the error that i was getting it was because some printers came out with some defects and that i had to return it to them if i wanted to get it fixed but since my warranty had spire i had to payi mentioned that if it was a manufactured defect they should fix it but they refusedit was almost brand new and a had to throw it in the trashi read some info online about it and i realize i wasn't the only one having this problemmy advice is buy anything but canon it's the worst printerunless you want to throw your money in the trash the way i did
5,Excellent Printer,This printer does everything it says it can do. The printer is primarily used for my business. Documents and copies print crisp and clear. It scans beautifully. Pictures print fast and the color and detail is wonderful. You can print either previously downloaded pictures through your computer or through the disk directly in the printer which will download the pictures to your computer.I would highly recommend this printer.
5,Great Printer,Great printer. Very quiet and great quality printing. Prints clean and clear photos. We love the bottom paper loading feature. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase again.
4,"so far, GREAT","I've had this printer for less than two months so I don't feel I've had it long enough to give a full picture. However, so far, this is the best printer I've ever owned. The printer it replaced was an HP deskjet 6122 which just quit on me. This Canon prints a lot faster, and the quality of printing is superior to the HP. This is the first time I've had an all in one--copy, photo, scan and print, and the quality of all is excellent. Time will tell, but I'm optimistic! The ONLY reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I haven't had it long enough."
3,not wireless,this printer will print through a MAC airport but it will NOT scan through a MAC airport. no canon product available yet that will do this. what a bummer. otherwise a great gizmo.
5,My favorite printer!,"OK, I am a complete sucker for new technology...and this printer definitely makes me happy. :) I managed to combine my all-in-one printer/scanner/copier and my photo printer, good stuff. Not to mention, the photo printer is fantastic! It is SO fast, and great quality. You can use any size photo paper. There are separate ink tanks, so if one of the CMY tanks is low, you don't have to change the whole cartridge - just the tank that you actually need to change...good stuff. Very easy to use, convenient size (not to bring with you anywhere - but certainly for underneath my computer desk), looks great (everything kind of closes up when you're not using it), and - again - the photo printing is super fast (even on highest quality setting). I highly recommend."
1,Defective,"I was impressed by the features and many positivie reviews for this printer. I ordered it and eagerly set it up. Unfortunately, I didn't even get to load any paper, because I got an error during running set up. The error message was not in the direction book, so I called customer service. Long story short, the technician could not help. He suggested I send it back to Canon at my cost and then Canon would send a refurbished one. I returned it to Amazon and, thinking I had just got unlucky, ordered the same printer again. Well, I couldn't believe it, but the second one wouldn't work either. I didn't get the same error message, but the paper would not feed through the machine. this time when I returned it, I ordered the epson r380 instead. It installed easily and works great so far.Perhaps I was just unlucky twice, but there seem to be quality control problems. Buyer beware."
5,This Canon printer is responsible for my divorce from HP,"This printer received top choice in PC World magazine (which is really the reason why I bought it) and second place in Computer Shopper magazine.You will not be disappointed, great scan quality, great photo printing quality. After using a laserjet printer for the last fews years and finally deciding I wanted the ability to print color again I expected the print time to be slow (compared to the laserjet), but after the printer is turned on and does its initializing documents and photos print quickly.Another reason I bought this printer was the cartridge costs. Seem to be a little more affordable then HP's.The only reason I would deter anyone from buying this printer is if they had limited space in which to place it."
1,Good if it works,"A good all around unit, but it stopped working after 6 months. There's a problem many others have reported with recognizing the ink cartridges. Canon won't stand by it, so off to the dump with this 6 month old printer. Very frustrating. Don't fall into the same trap that I did.paul"
3,High quality prints fast BUT.............,"Love the quality and speed of the Canon MP600 prints but the ink tanks get used up quite fast and I suffer from alot of ink tank errors where the cartrage is full of ink but the printer does not read the tank causing me to open the machine and re insert the ink cartrage before it will print again, this gets old after awhile and can be frustrating."
2,IMPRESSIVE COLOURS - POOR DURABILITY !!,"I PURCHASED THE PIXMA BASED ON QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE CANON NAME . . . AT FIRST THE UNIT PERFORMED IMPECCABLY . . . NOW, AFTER JUST 6 MONTHS, FOR ME TO GET A CLEAN REPRODUCTION I HAVE TO CLEAN THE INK HEADS BEFORE EACH USE !!! THAT IS A NUISANCE AND A WASTE OF INK !! I WROTE TO THE MANUFACTURER AND WAS TOLD THE UNIT HEAD NEEDED TO BE REPLACED !! AFTER 6 MONTHS ???? I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER CANON ALL-IN-ONE PRINTER !!"
2,Printer is Rude,"The Printer is nice, but the associated software is rude. They put links to their documents into the Word and WordPad menu. They color their entries in the program list. The point is that if everyone did this sort of thing, the computer would be irritating and unusable. They don't need to advertise themselves after the customer has installed the printer. For this reason alone, I wouldn't buy this thing."
2,Great machine that broke down unbelievably fast,"I've owned this multifunction printer for 13 months. I loved it, gave it light to moderate use, and it just broke. It's no longer in warranty. Every printer I've owned previously lasted a minimum of five years. Very disappointing."
1,Did not work out of the box !!!!!!!!!!!,"Bought this printer after reading glowing reviews and I liked how it looked. I got the printer home and followed the setup instructions carefully. When I got to the ""add paper to automatically align the print heads"" part of the setup, the paper would not even feed. It would crinkle up and jam. Seemed like one side of paper feed worked and other side did not, as it crinkled only on one side. After checking over and over for obstruction and following the trouble shooting and owners manual, I gave up and returned it for a refund. I'll never know how it printed cause it was a lemon from the start. Now I'm shopping for another printer."
5,"Canon , one great printer",So far this is one great printer. All the pictures that I have copied look like a professional has done them. The printer does what they claim and prints very clear and sharp. I like this printer alot.
1,Driver nightmare,Be careful because Canon does not update it's driver software. I have a 2 year old Canon printer and Canon will not produce Windows drivers. This means my printer will be useless if I go to Windows Vista or buy new PC. The original driver will most likely be the only driver ever made.
5,super easy,"This printer prints excellent pictures. Very high resolution. With the view screen and scroll wheel, it is so simple to use, you wont even need the manual! It is also very quiet and fast printing. Plus it looks sexy in my desk! Best all-in-one for the money!"
4,"So Far, So Good","I bought this printer for my new home office and computer set up. It came highly reccommended by two of my friends who have the next model down. I was really impressed initially on how cool looking this printer is, sleek lines and a nice modern look that matched my computer. Initial set up was very quick and easy and print quality seems great so far (Although I havent used it as a photo printer yet). The SD card reader in the front, the colorful LCD screen and the front mount USB plug are all nice features. The only reason I am giving this (4) stars is because I have only been using for about a month and it hasn't been subjected to heavy usage yet."
5,EXCELENTE...INCREIBLE,"Esta impresora es una verdadera todo en una. La tengo usando en la oficina y a la verdad es que me encanta. Me he ahorrado mucho dinero con su uso. Si volviera a comprar otra impresora, volvería a comprar una Canon."
4,"Good on the exercise, but...","I have this one from my mom. It has lots of good info on conditioning exercises & on the dance movements. What it doesn't have is enough information on the costuming for me, so I'm getting ""Costuming from the Hip."" I try to do the exercises every day, BUT double-check some with an modern exercise instructor, some movements (BOUNCING especially) are known for damaging to the muscles these days."
5,I finally found it.,"I owned this same book in the early 1970's I loved it mainly for the excerises. The book came quiet quickly and was in good shape. I would buy from them again. I was all good. Thank you,"
5,The beginning.....,"I can only add to the nostalgia shared with the rest, I remember my friend and I in our living rooms, propping this great book open and trying to bring our dream of belly dancing into fruition. For those of us from the dark ages, we begin here, one of the best books around then, until instructors were more accessible. I proudly keep this book, weathered and dog-eared, in my favorite book shelf, which I borrowed from my friend several decades ago. I cannot part with it.We felt connected to our dream, through this book, and it has come to fruition.The instruction is precise, the photography is well done in black and white. It is a great reference tool, with much that is not done in video.I am fortunate to have this book."
2,"Sweat proof, not so much","I'm a big proponent of using quality sunblock. I decided to give Solrx a try, hoping that it would be as good or better than my favorite sunblock, Aloe Gator. I applied it to my face before a bike ride last weekend, and once I started sweating it began running into my eyes. The sting was horrible. The bottle clearly states that it's sweat proof. I don't think so. I still use it for my arms, neck, legs, etc., but I'm sticking with Aloe Gator for my face. I won't buy it again."
1,Dead Man's Curve,"As a fan of Douglas Fairbanks Jr I ordersd the ""DEAD MAN'S CURVE"" DVD ,hoping for a copy of this rare 1928 silent movie,but I recieved instead a copy of the same-titled 1998 movie with Mathew Lillard.Don't trust the particular seller.Orestis"
4,Spring Break by Johanna Hurwitz,"I like this book because it is very exciting and I really wanted to know what would happen. I was tempted to read while I was in my math class..Cricket's dream was to go to Washington D.C and finally her friend, Zoe invited her to go to Washington D.C during their spring break. But something bad happened so she missed her trip to Washington D.C with her friend. But she had fun staying at home. My favorite part was when her teacher asked Cricket whether she wanted to enter the contest and so I really wanted to know whether she would win or lose. And only one way to find out is to read it!!"
1,Very slow cable,I am using this cable to transfer large files between devices. I find that we cannot even get 1 megabit through it.
4,"Chris, you've done it again!","Chris Feare wrote an excellent title on Starlings back in '78 and he's done wonders once again. Both for researchers like myself and avid bird enthusiasts, this is an excellent reference book."
3,Nostalgia for Steel,"This volume is essentially a tally of the liners in the period. The companion book to ""The First Great Ocean Liners 1897-1927"", each ship is shown in at least one photo but none have any significant coverage. A short history for each ship is also included which sometimes reveals how business ventures can go wrong. It also highlights the need for maritime regulations.Typical interior shots give you a feel for what the hoi-poloi got for their money.I would have liked line drawings. But that would escalate the level of research and cost of the book. As it is, this book may tease your interest in some specific ship and prompt you to do some digging on your own which is not a bad thing."
2,crude,"This tool as it comes proves the adage, ""You get what you pay for"". It is made in India, and though the brass seems ok, everything else about the quality is lacking. I should have taken D. Dimas's review more literally; unless, like D. Dimas, you are prepared to put a lot of time into making this ""precision"" measuring device precise, skip it."
4,Music Note Cookie Cutter,This was received days before I was told I would receive it. I am very impressed and pleased and would order from this vendor again!
1,Reliability problems with Rampage ACD94,"I too purchased at Fry's Electronics for $60 a Rampage ACD94. The first one worked OK for a whole five days before the display malfunctioned and had to be returned. The second one would not load a CD and too had to be returned. Only after the third try, do I finally have a defect free AM/FM CD/MP3 reciever. So buyers should be aware of poor customer reviews of Audiovox products and reliabily problems with their products."
1,DO not buy the DLO Shell it will ruin your Ipod!,"The Shell from DLO is poorly designed, the very act of placing it in the shell the 1st time will scratch your screen and back.Oh and if you are looking for DLO's phone # or contact info, here you go.Domain Name: DLO.COMRegistrant [61501]:Jeff Grady2335 Presidential Dr.Suite 114DurhamNC27703USAdministrative Contact [61501]:Jeff Grady jgrady@netalog.com2335 Presidential Dr.Suite 114DurhamNC27703USPhone: +1.9194057030Fax: +1.9194056196Billing Contact [61501]:Jeff Grady jgrady@netalog.com2335 Presidential Dr.Suite 114DurhamNC27703USPhone: +1.9194057030Fax: +1.9194056196Technical Contact [61501]:Jeff Grady jgrady@netalog.com2335 Presidential Dr.Suite 114DurhamNC27703USPhone: +1.9194057030Fax: +1.9194056196"
1,Don't do it man.,This doesn't fit the latest Ipod Nano. Definitely not worth the money. Recommend the Agent 18.
1,Yuck!,Can't charge with case on. Fits is too tight. Agent18 is better design.Also cannot use the toggle switch because the plastic is too think to stick a finger on the control and I am a petite woman with small hands. Unfortunately I cannot return this as I opened up the product!The only good thing is that it is clear plastic.
2,No Way To Charge Your Nano,"This is a very poorly engineered case because there is no way to access the charging doc on your nano without opening the case and taking it out. The case fits very tightly together, so getting it open every other day is stupid!Do not buy this case. Look for one with a hole in the bottom for easy charging."
2,Nice info; fake sympathy,"This book contains good information about the science behind nicotine addition. For someone sincerly trying to quit, it's useful - if you can get past the pedantic ""sure it's hard, but aren't you worth it?"" tone. Recipes are good."
3,GPS and Land Navigation,"I was very disappointed in this product. I had hoped for a instructional DVD and info to help me decide which GPS to purchase. What I got seemed to be more of an advertisement for the Garmin Etrex Vista. Watching people hiking while looking at their GPS doesn't provide much useful information. The narrator came across as a salesman rather than an instructor. At no time did he provide any useful information on the UTM grid mapping system which is rapidly replacing the old coordinate system as the preferred mapping system for GPS.Since I got this video, I have purchased a Garmin 60csx (from Amazon, BTW-best price) which I am extremely happy with. I also purchased a specific 60csx instructional video from Bennett Marine Video which does a much better job."
5,A dictionary?,"How refresing to find a dictionary that provides some good laughs (""Always do right; this will gratify some people and astonish the rest."" Or, ""I don't give a damn for a man who can spell a word only one way.""And some surprises, too. ""It is a difference of opinions that makes the horse races."" I didn't know that Twain said that one!Evelyn Horn"
3,Not for every motorcyclist...,"I purchased two of these to use as motorcycle intercoms. I figured that at $15.00 each I couldn't make too much of a mistake. Well, as far as motorcycle intercoms go, it was a BIG mistake! The headsets, even though they fit behind the head, were impossible to use under my motorcycle helmet. Granted, these might work well with a helmet that does not cover the ears, but with the full-face helmet that I use there was no way to make them work. Just too thick to fit between my ear and the helmet.The units work fine and are as inexpensive a radio as you can purchase. Just don't purchase for motorcycle use unless you have a helmet that will allow PLENTY of room for the ear-pieces to fit."
3,Decent Intro to Kayaking,"This is a decent introduction to kayaking, but spends too much time on more advanced topics such as navigation, course plotting, etc., and too little on the different strokes, self- and assisted-rescue, and enter/exit techniques for kayaking."
4,Very informative,"The book is straight forward, and gives good direction. A word of caution: you need a well equipt wood working shop."
4,JOURNEY'S BEST !!,"This is Journey's best, if you can call it to a band that was always totally radio friendly. The case is that Journey at least managed to sound convincing, in most part thanks to Steve Perry's passional singing and Neal Schon craftmanship in the guitar. ESCAPE is really well produced by Mike Stone and Keith Elson, the songs are shinning with life."
3,Journey,"My girlfriend dad has this Cd and turns it up so loud its rediculus! He was telling her that this is the best rock Cd every made. So we have been listining to it every day. I see alot of people here say its good and they remember playing it when they weere kids. So I have a question? What is a arcade? My uncle said thats where they used to get cigarrettes when they were not old enuff to smoke! And also my girlfriend step-mom said that the lead singer is the first rockstar clone? She was smiled when she says it, but what does that mean? I really like the slow songs better, like the very last one is good. But some of it is just too cheezy."
2,best left in the 80's,"having liked this back in the day i was glad to acquire another copy - until i put the CD on. Dated isn't the word for it. Every song at the same plodding, stupefying tempo, but with the same interchangeable (and innappropriately fast) guitar solo - you can tell it's a 'jazz' drummer with those 'tasteful' splash cymbals everywhere - 'Mother Father' an excuse for one chord change after another with no rhyme or reason. Sorry, I feel bad too but..."

4,IM PROUD TO BE BRITTISH!!,"okay, i forgot that showtime aint released untill the 14th in america but, i'll write the first reveiw anyway!!!if you liked boy in da corner than you will like this!! BUT!!! dont be fooled!! the beats in this one are heavyer and have more bass, there are hardly any ""tunes"" on this c.d, so, if your the kind of person who likes a song to have a nice melody on it, than, this is'nt for you!!! RAP IS ABOUT THE WORDS AND LYRICS!! NOT THE TUNE IN THE BACKGROUND!! the first single from the album ""stand up tall"" is a sure fire party starter!! other tracks that stand out are ""learn"" and ""girls"" if you like klashnekoff, ca$hino and d-black than you will LOVE this!!! GET IT NOW!!!! oh.... i forgot you cant yet.......HA HA HA HA"
4,Quality product,The only problem with this product is the height.They made it too low and it touches the food all the time.
3,good good good good good good goodgood good good good good good goodgood good good good good good good. it was good I liked it,good good good good good good goodgood good good good good good goodgood good good good good good good. it was good I liked it
3,"Pretty good, could be a little higher. Product label sticker is annoying to get off","I like that it's possible to move a ""switch"" on the top so you can let steam escape or not depending on what you are cooking. it would be helpful if the cover was a little taller. As it is, it sits on top of (touching) medium sized items like a roast chicken. I dinged this an additional star for putting on one of those annoying labels that are nearly impossible to scrape off without scratching up the item. There is no reason for it and very annoying."
3,Okely Dokely,"A great selection of songs. Some of the films/series I hadnt heard of because we dont have them in England but the majority of them I did. I also found that some of the songs wer composed on a octave too low for me to play, on the flute, so I had to alter them myself. Over all though a good buy, great value for mone"
3,Be wary of publishing info...,"I had clearly put in an order for the 3rd edition of the Disney Fake Book, but ended up receiving the 2nd edition instead (I only immediately noticed a lack of Princess and the Frog songs, but I'm OK with these content differences). For those wanting the songs included in the 3rd edition, be aware of the publishing date under ""Product Information"" - it notes it's the second edition, published in 1996. I'd recommend buying from another source for the edition you want. Otherwise, as other reviews have noted, it's a great book for any experienced musician looking for an opportunity to comp to Disney favorites, or for a beginner who just wants the melody. Can't wait to dive in!"
4,Definitely underrated by some,"i have heard many rave reviews about this album, along the lines of ""one of the best albums you've never heard."" this i find to be slightly true. the drumming is very authentic (that's the best i can come up with). the guitar is all over the place and the vocal stylings take a little to get used to, but then it all clicks. this is definitely one of those ""it just suddenly clicked"" albums, which means it may never click for some listeners. i think that is what makes some cds so great. the fact that not everyone can like them. i dig this album and i suggest it to everyone, with the highest hopes that it does click."
3,Could've been better for a Ken Andrews production.,"I bought this CD because it was produced by the brilliant Ken Andrews(of ON and Failure). The first track ""Coin Toss"" rocks, and you can hear the Failure influence. The rest of the disk is pretty standard really, these guys are a lot like Hum- the music is jamming however something is missing in the vocals. The singer reminded me of the guy from The Strokes, melodic at times and annoyingly pushed at others. I found this one in the bargain bin at a local record shop. Best bet is to attain it through Amazon here- it's worth a few listens and any Failure lover should have it in their collection, but I wouldn't pay more than six bucks for it. Warning to those who buy it; the last tune ""Catfish"" is oddly cool but the ending goes on for what seems like forever."
1,Kindle edition a waste of money,"I opted for the kindle editon because I did not want to carry the thick paperback volume around. Big mistake. The search function does not work on the kindle (it does work however if I read the book on my Mac.) The worst is the font size. None of the Chinese characters used throughout the book can be enlarged for easier or more comfortable reading, and much of the English text happens to be embedded with the hanzi, so you cannot enlarge it either. Especially in the Answer key, the fonts are so small you really need a magnyfying glass to read it at all!!!I think this is unfair. It should be clearly stated on the website so that people know what not to expect (all you excpect from a normal kindle edition: search functions that actually work, font resize functions, etc.) I would certainly have abstained from buying it or would have gone for the paperback edition instead. A ripoff."
5,Great Workbook,This is a great workbook and has helped me so much. The characters are very basic so even a beginner can use it if not they can all easily be found on nciku.
3,"a good start for begginers, great for elementary classrooms","If you are just into puppet making for fun and not really into the art of making them, this book is for you. The puppets built inside are very basic and developed sot hat anybody can make them. It's a fun book, but personaly I felt it was a little childish and didn't really touch base on some of other techniques. If you are looking to make a more muppet style puppet this book does not cover it. however his second book Puppet Planet is an excelent book that goes into more detail and more profetional style puppet making."
4,Puppet Mania,"Well,It is good for kids, and as a teaching aid, Good photo reference ,pattern samples. An ideal book for beginners and show an array of materials that can be used with construction methods. Even though i would not really use it as a propmaker I would use it to teach or make puppets with my son.p/s I would buy this before buying the foam book"
2,A nice starter for children.,I was alittle disappointed when I receieved this book. God knows the title is a bit of an exageration. If you're buying for a child who needs craft projects for a rainy day then this is the book for you.As an adult with a career in puppet building I found it a waste of money. Unless you're making a show that revolves around paper plate puppets.
4,For my needs very good,"My requirements were a sturdy, small footprint, stool since I have a small space for my electronic piano. This is perfect. Compared to the stools i've seen at stores the price was quite good as well. Others note that it is not as easy to collapse and reset, but that really is not how my use will be. However, if you plan on collapsing and resetting in a stage environment, I suggest you look for something else."
1,Amazon sent us cheep version of the On Stage bench 2 times!,"Just as another person commented, Amazon is shipping a much inferior product than it listed and picture. We got the wrong one, sent it back and they sent us another package containing the same low-end stool with little padding (I think the maker is guardian).We already own an On Stage keyboard bench (which we obviously like) and the two benches side by side are a joke. The recent bench they are sending is low quality which isn't worth the price they are charging for the On Stage. This is not user error on our part. They are shipping the wrong (yet similar) product. I will update this review if they ever send us the correct bench."
5,"Looks good, good price","This went very well with an electronic keyboard that came with it's own stand. This little bench was simple, affordable and space saving. Great solution."
4,Item different from picture but still well built,Item arrived on time . It looks to be well built but item is different from the picture. Over all is good
2,Could have been worthy!,"Even with a stellar line up and as a great standard French crime flic(k) this edition is second rate. The film is dubbed in English and has no language or sub title options. In its original French, this would be a classic to watch and enjoy but the dubbing is second rate and spoils the whole feel of the movie, so look for the French language version if you can find one."
5,"it is dubbed in English, still spectacular","Of course I would prefer the French/original language but the movie is sooo good, I still recommend it (this review is for the PAL region 2 DVD)"
3,Anandi Ma sings healing mantras,"This compact disk is of mantras in the Hindu tradition. The singer has a beautiful voice and the whole disk is nicely produced. It will be of interest to those who are committed to the Hindu way of worship. To others it may seem repetitious. Whether listening to these will or will not raise consciousness is argumentive. However, to those who like the Hindu way, and follow it, any of Anandi's recordings are worth while. Her husband's deeper voice harmonizes well."
2,"Almost, but not quite...","I've used Dryel for years, and used to be pretty happy with it, as it seemed to do a good job of freshening up my shirts, pants, & even some jackets. However, in the last couple years, it seems to have been rendered impotent. One night out with a lady friend of mine, I kept smelling a funky odor, and wondered what it was, and that it might be her.... Well, as I drove home, I realized the smell was still lingering, and finally realized it was my shirt! The normal ""freshening"" of my clothes failed to occur, and the shirt smelled just as it did after a night of playing sax, in a hot, steamy, Georgia night club! Well, that's obviously not acceptable. I've tried a couple other boxes of them, and I've found this to be the new norm, if something has been worn while in a sweaty environment, forget about any nice smelling results..."
2,Depends on what you're looking for I guess...,"If you're looking to have fresher smelling clothes then go for it. But if you're looking for a cleaning then this is not the way to go. I put a few specific dress shirts in to get the ring around the collar out and this did not do a thing for that. But the garments did come out smelling springtime fresh. I guess that counts for something. I may have missed something is the process, so if anyone has any suggestions as to what I can do to make this work please comment here. I'd be happy to try out some suggestions."
5,lasts a long time,this one bag has lasted a awful long time - and still have a lot of - it is the same thing you'd stick in a pillow
4,price is right.,"So, I was using a 2.99 pillow from walmart that i cut open and used the floss out of that, but it is clumpy and I just wasn't comfortable with it. I use this stuff now and it works as it should. very fine and easy to get a small portion. I clean mine out daily and it keeps the water nice and clear."
5,Cheap floss,"It's a nice big bag of polyester floss for a crazy low price. The floss is packed in there pretty good, too. I've taken out about 4 handfuls of it and the bag still looks full."
4,Sad News,"I was a fan and neighbor to Alzo for many years. I loved his music since I saw him live in 1973. Unfortunately Alzo passed away on February 2, 2004 after suffering a heart attack. He will be missed."
2,NO ONE CAN UNDERSTAND YOU,"Kelly McGillis who was so radiant in ""Witness"" and ""Top Gun"" looks out of place in this well-crafted but ultimately frustrating movie.What starts out as a fairly interesting, and rather puzzling who is doing it, culminates in an ending that is so out of kilter you wonder why the director allowed the screenwriter to force this ridiculous ending on an unsuspecting audience. Just when you think the killer has been identified (and the killer admits he's the killer), a coda at the end suggests otherwise, WITHOUT any resolution. Like leaving it open for a sequel? Hardly, in this 2001 New Zealand film.Overall, even though it holds your interest until the end, it's a cheap thrills movie."
5,The Toucans are the Real Deal,Quite good for a homegrown steel drum band. One has to admit that there are not lots of opportunities to learn steel drum music in the PNW so the fact that these boys can make your belly vibrate with the haunting sounds of old oil cans is amazing. Mr. Witmer's lead pan style sets the stage for wonderful renditions of carribbean classics as well as familiar covers such as Brown-eyed girl. I like the rendition of El Cumbanchero a nice branching out from traditional Antillean rhythms into the musical influences of the Latino-Caribe. A nice blend. I for one know the difference between their CD and a Loop.
3,Derivative but eminently readable...,"The debt to Bram Stoker is immediately evident but this shouldn't entirely detract from what is, in its own right, a genuinely disturbing story, set in a Carpathian castle and featuring a spinechilling and gratifying remorseless conclusion. The structure - a series of letters, journals and transcripts - obviously and unapologetically owes much to Bram Stoker. The language is unspectacular but effective; he has a spare and quite classically Gothic style which ensures that the pages keep turning over. Not an epoch-marking book, but certainly worth reading."
2,"GREAT WRITING, STORY WENT NOWHERE, DISAPPOINTING","Atmospheric, truly thrilling, just went nowhere, disappointing protagonist(s)end up no place. Nothing frightening materializes as the book jacket promises, certainly nothing ""worse than vampires"" as the book jacket again promises. Just nothing, fright, fear, but nothing behind it."
4,"A Dark, Impressive Novel","This is not a common vampire novel, but it is impressive. It is short, and the writing is vivid and spare. The ending is despairing - the triumph of evil, there are no neat solutions, no trite ""happy ending."""
1,Will there be a sequel?,"I kind of like the story, but it ends too soon. Unless there will be a sequel of it published, I do not think I will recommend this book to anyone."
1,"Nothing, it seems","Well, I rarely come across good horror books, and it seems this time I also did. Jonathan Aycliffe's The Lost is terrible. There is nothing interesting about the book. The plot is boring, the style is ridiculous, and the content is... well, nothing."
1,Extraordinarily Disappointing!,"The beginning and the middle are not that bad, actually. But the ending of the story is very bad. No conclusion, no happy ending, just cruel and meaningless intentions. If you want to read good horror books with happy ending, also with the same format (using letters and journals to tell the story), Jeanne Kalogridis' trilogy of The Diaries of the Family Dracul is a good choice."
1,Avoid reading this one,"If you want an enjoyable horror book, this one is a must avoid and definitely is not one of those books you can't put down. I suggest those by Stephen King or Robert R. McCammon if you are looking for good horror books. This book, The Lost, by Jonathan Aycliffe, is definitely a terribly poor horror book."
4,I'd recommend this book to any vampire/horror lovers.,"I really like the verse, all laid out in letters, notes, and transcripts of taped observations. It only took a few pages before I was trying to guess what ""Mihai"" was going to discover next. I felt a great deal of suspence throughout and the ending is fitting to a classic horror/vampire script. Overall, a refreshing approach to a genre that has seen too many miserable attempts"
1,Stoker would be embarrassed,"The most disappointing book I ever read. I hate it very much. If Stoker were still alive, this book would make him very embarrassed to see someone from his country wrote it. And so what if it is set up in Carpathians too?"
1,Didn't receive the merchandise,I have seen the calendar online and ordered it but the order was cancelled when the supplier could not provide the produce.In a search of many stores and online shops I found only 1 copy of the calendar between Oct 2005-Jan 2006. It was fantastic but I don't have one.
1,TIME OF THE GYPSIES,"Not up to par. If you loved the movie and its soundtrack, forget this, very off broadway production. The characters are not the same people and the story is similar but, the songs and music are quite different from the move and soundtrack of the movie. This cd is better off skipped."
4,cool game!!,"Awsome game, for ps2.analog sticks are a pain, I'd rather the directional buttons, But it's the same for nintendo wii (allthough You don't have a nunchuck for ps2) So, I guess it's about the same. Except the games are the same 4 ps2 and wii but they have different rating one teen (wii) evyone (ps2)Same graphic desighn too.Still great game!!I would recamend itNot really for kids though"
3,Eh...,"My son gets frustrated with this TMNT game. he much prefers the other one we have for the playstation. ok and maybe he'll like it when he gets a bit older, but for now he won't play it."
3,Adventure Mirror?,"It is a nice mirror for your dolls - and if you want to reenact the stories, it is a fun prop. That said, I want to reiterate that it is simply a mirror with a wooden frame and some stickers. Your doll can look in it and that is about it. Not much adventure in looking...."
3,simple but fun!,"I bought this game for my 3 year old and he absolutely loved it! It may be simple without many levels or other exciting features/graphics, but we are not into xbox or playstation, etc. I bought this knowing it would be just a fun, easy way of introducing basic concepts to pre-schoolers and that's exactly what it does."
3,"OK, but better choices out there","My son is a big Thomas fan so this is one of the first cartridges I bought for his new ClickStart.The games do feature the Thomas characters in believable settings, and the activities are generally educational. Sir Top'em Hat is the narrator and is difficult to understand at times. Also the audio instructions are frequently difficult to hear over the music.Lastly, maybe I'm expecting too much, but the player gets the same ""well done"" message even if they didn't do anything. My son quickly caught onto this.If your kid is a Thomas buff this is a good game. If you are only getting a couple for your ClickStart I think there are better choices."
5,Entertaining and Educational,"We purchased this for our Grandchildren to use and it has worked well. It is still a bit advanced for our 2 year old, but he is catching on. Our 4 year old thoroughly enjoys it. The combination of play and learning is excellent."
3,LeapFrog ClickStart,"First comment of the product is the quality of video is not for 42"" Plasma TV. The product is to be run on a smaller TV set. As when I run it on the wide screen TV, it becomes digital pixels.Secondly, the mouse is something for kid to learn how to use a mouse, but I think it is too small, and there is no way to detech the mouse.Overall, it is ok, there are still a few things my son can learn."
5,A Rembrandt for the 90's,"Although the technology used to create this mind-bending computer animated journey is a little out of date, the artistic creativity makes up for it. Ian Hammer did a fantastic job of setting the musical ambiance - which is like a Syntho-musical van Gogh. After 5 minutes of watching the animation I was totally entranced, unable to take my eyes away even for a minute. The musical video cast's some kind of techno-hypnotic spell that draws you in and keeps you engrossed to the very end. This is a must-have for any DVD enthusiast."
4,beyond the mind's eye,short video but very interesting. My father reccomended it and i didn't know what to expect. It was suprisingly alot cooler than i thought. Very intruiging film.
4,Classic Animation Video,"The image quality is not the best, the menu is not good, but you can have a classic animation video, the first in MIND'S EYE. I had it in VHS but its better in DVD for the small space, the audio and video quality could be better.if you're fan of it, buy it now ;)"
3,commercial drivel,"After reading all of the shining reviews this CD has been given here, I have to ask: are you people DRUNK? Sure, Steve Perry's voice sounds great, but it always does. And Neal Schon's guitar sounds great, but it always does. So what's missing? Go back and listen to Infinity, Evolution, Departure, Escape, Frontiers, whatever...hear those songs? That sound? THAT'S Journey. What you have with Raised on Radio is a Steve Perry solo album with Neal Schon and Jonathan Caine as backup musicians. ""Be Good to Yourself"" is the only track that even sounds like Journey...the rest, especially ""Why Can't this Night Go On Forever:...well, if you think that sounds like Journey, GOOD Journey, you obviously have a ""Foolish Heart."" Thank God ""Arrival"" sees the band back on track these days."
3,Very polished effort,If you want polished ballads then this the album for you.Lots of good ones here.Sometimes I don't know whether I want to like this album or not.Never heard the song Raised on Radio on the radio.This rocked a little harder and should have garnered more attention.Steve had some great vocals on this album and I feel Neil never had a shining moment.That hasn't happened since Escape.Everything is too polished here.Be Good to Yourself is the only real signature song here.
2,I don't like this CD,"It's the worst of journey.I like only ""Why can't this night go on forever"" and ""Girl can't help""."
3,"This is the one they should have called ""Departure""","Raised on Radio is a complete ""Departure"" from the rock and roll we came to expect from Journey up to that point. This whole album is pure lite-pop, adult contemporary drivel. Although I wanted to give it 1 star, I gave it 3 because it is really not a bad record - it's just a very disappointing JOURNEY record. It does sound similiar to Steve Perry's solo recordings so if you enjoyed the lighter style in those then you'll probably like this album as well. However, if it's the hard-driving rock and roll that made you a Journey fan, then you will be profoundly disappointed here.I won't comment on every song, I'll just tell you to listen to the second song Positive Touch. I honestly thought I was listening to the Pointer Sisters singing I'm So Excited or Billy Joel singing Tell Her About It. When Journey starts sounding more like the Pointer Sisters or Billy Joel it's time to stop the world, I need to get off."
5,Their best...,"""Raised On Radio"" suffers a fairly poor reputation amongst Journey die-hards, probably due to the time it took to release, the firing of the rhythm section partway during recording, and the fact that the band broke up soon afterwards.For those of us who love the music more than the band though this is a delightful CD from start to finish. The whole thing has a warmth and sparkle to it that is missing from much of their work (including the ludicrously overrated ""Escape""). Even the maudlin tunes make you happy.Steve Perry is at his very best vocally here, and that is saying a lot. The harmony vocals on all tracks are also breathtaking. Every tune is absolutely killer, with no ""Back Talk"" incongrously shoved in to remind you they're human...a great album that deserves a far greater reputation."
3,A decent pop album,"2000 ""The Screen Behind The Mirror"" - that is a quite decent pop album. Still good production and quality of the songs above average from that period. Unfortunately ""TSBTM"" is far below standard set up by ""The Cross Of Changes"" (in my opinion ultimate Enigma creation with superb connection of rock and chill out themes). Highlights of the album: ""Gravity of Love"", ""Smell of Desire"", ""Modern Crusaders"", ""Traces"" and title track. Nice addition was to use voice of Ruth Ann (of band Olive)."
5,It's great,"It's my first new album of this year and I suppose it will be the best one. Since January 18 I've heard it more than 50 times and it's not enough. All the songs are great, but my favourite are ""Gravity of love"" and ""Silence must be heard"". Could be longer (is about 45 minutes), but still big. Everybody who liked previous ones will love this, because it's the continuation of Enigma 3. Try it!"
4,"different, yet unique","This album is a very nice album to listen to while taking a drive through the streets of New York, but unlike their past albums, it seems that they have left out that Enigma feeling of music and, instead, have taking a different route and style. This is indeed a much mature album and deserves more attention. If you're an Enigma fan then you will respect this new style."
2,Stop recycling the same old stuff,"I first encountered Enigma in the early 1990s in France. That initial CD was amazing, and really interesting. I still listen to it. The following releases have all been more of the same, and not nearly as well-done or creative. Colour them boring. New stuff, Puhleeze...."
3,Not what I would have expected for Egnima,"After listening to Enigma's newest CD (Screen Behind the Mirror)I wasn't that impressed with the style of music delivered this time. It appears that MC Curly (Micheal Cretu) decided to use samples of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana throughout the entire CD. The first two songs ""The Gate"" and ""Push the Limit"" seem to combine nicely together, beyond that, I was looking for some more electronic excitement. Something to dazzle me with a unique sound. Enigma isn't packing the type of punch I would have expected for the new millenium."
5,Enigma's Creative Thoughts and Moods Shine Through Again,"I have been an advid listner to Enigma since my introduction to there music three years ago. The long awaited forth album is good for the soul, it is the kind of music that the fans of Enigma have been anticipating to hear. It is nice to know that Enigma stays true to form. With there tell-tale introduction and closing the core of the album is solid music, it will weave the listners thoughts and feelings through corridors of light and dark. As all of the music of Enigma has done in the past it leaves the listner craving for more. I hope there will be lots more instore for us down the road! I would recommend this album to all who want to travel from the heart, mind and soul."
1,What is this?,"To be honest, I must say that this work was a VERY BIG dissapointment to me. Contrary to what some people have said about ""Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi,"" I believe that to be one of Enigma's best works. But this one just doesn't do it. The endless repetition of Orff's ""Oh Fortuna!"" from Carmina Burana seems SO out of place with the songs. And he just inserts it EVERYWHERE! If it made the music sound good then hey, go ahead. But it's just a cacophony and an incredibly annoying thing to hear. Never got through the whole disk in one sitting. Definetly NOT a recommendation!"
3,Not quite as good as MCMXC A.D,Sometimes I wish Cretu would keep quiet - everything else works so great!
2,Enigma's Worst,"This CD lacks the warm, spiritual quality of the first 3 Enigma releases. Definitely not music to relax to. It's the same Enigma style, but without the rich, creamy filling, so to speak. I didn't feel that any of the tracks were anywhere near the quality of my favorites from previous Enigma albums: ""Rivers of Belief"", ""Return to Innocence"", and ""TNT for the Brain"". I really don't see how anyone could consider this to be their best CD ever."
1,The screen behind the mirror,This is the worst Enigma's CD.Music is repetative with no imagination...Not worth the money!
2,No Thank You,Most of the music has such a similar beat that you find it hard to tell one from the other. This group is good to fall asleep by. Get some variation please.... we need more music worthy of the New Age. I will continue to search.
2,pretty disappointing,"MCMMLVIIICIXVIX was 5 stars, cross of changes was 3 at best, le roi was 4-maybe 4.5 stars, but this one sucks. The sampling of Verdi or whoever it was is popularizing and stinkifying to high hell some incredibly gorgeous operatic music. It's shameful, and Cretu maybe should be castrated--oh, wait, He must be to hit those feminine notes he does. The female vocalist (not Cretu) is the only good singing on this record. The voice of Cretu is as usual saturated in reverb and delay, which really crapifies the sound, and makes it seem like he was desperate to somehow make this feeble attempt at music sound good. There are some good melodies here and there, but they are too broken up by garbage that the album as a whole is unlistenable and annoying. Enigma's strength is melody and weaving it into an album length song-experience, and this one entirely fails. The artwork seems to reflect the music too--choose an album based on the picture--it's about right."
5,So close to perfect.,"To put it simply, this is the second best album ever made, second only to Le Roi Est Mort, Vive le Roi. Michael Cretu is an absolute genious. His mysterious (enigmatic) lyrics, his beautiful, unique music... Words just cannot do it justice.""Gravity of Love"" is the most beautiful song ever created. ""Push the Limits,"" ""Traces (Light and Weight),"" ""Smell of Desire,"" and ""Between Mind and Heart"" are the other major standouts. The reason this album doesn't quite stand up to Le Roi Est Mort is that there are a couple songs that I could take or leave, whereas Le Roi does not have one track I don't love.Cretu, I love you."
1,i hate this album but.......,"if your a fan of this genre of music, i highly suggest prodigy ""the fat of the land""."
3,You left me hangin',In my opinion...any albums after the first will never compare...on every album released after the first...there has only been one or two good singles worth listening to...the rest of the tracks dragged on...as for the their newest.. track 3 w/ the girl from the group Olive doin vocals definately delivers...as well as the beats hittin in track two...if u notice...they use snippets from the first album in the background throughout this one....sorry guys...u left me hangin wanting a lil bit more than u delivered....
3,Nice try...,"Well, Enigma almost gets it right. I could realy do without the Carmina Burana samples, they detract from what could possibly be an excellent cd. The first sample of Orff, to my ears, is the largest flaw in the album. The cd starts off as the previous 3 enigma titles do and then explodes with ""O Fortuna"". Not only is it out of place but at the end of said sample a horrible job of fading back into the mix is made. The sample shows up in a few more places buried beneath some nice layers, unfortunately it is still there.I have to say that it is far superior to Enigma's last effort. Still, I probably won't listen to it often.Instead of buying this, buy OLIVE-EXTRA VIRGIN. Ruth-Ann is the voice featured on track 3. Buy Olive, or don't. What do I care?My advice: Trick a friend into buying Enigma 4 and copy it if it's to your liking."
2,Pretty Weak,"Enigma have done some great stuff but there's not much greatness to be had on this CD. It is all pretty much self-indulgent and repetitive. Some tracks hint at some cool melodic ideas but they are never developed or taken advantage of. The only true stand-out track on this CD is Modern Crusaders, which just happens to be BRILLIANT and is worth buying the CD alone. It's a shame, and unusual, that nothing else on this CD is recommendable. Enigma can usually be relied upon to come up with unique atmospheres and moods, but not this time."
2,Cretu gone lazy,"I have enjoyed all the previous enigma albums thus far, except this one. It is both 'unoriginal' and recycled music, which has lead me to believe that maybe enigma has gotten lazy in their old age."
3,not unusual for enigma,"This record is kinda unbearably lofty- it speaks about gravity, mars, love, future, crusaders, quest, silence, engine, heart, mind and who knows what else. Full with mantric, inventive sounds, sighs, beats and monkish chorus, the effects become a kinda experiment, although this is never unusual with enigma. Listening to it inflicts you with a mood similar to creeps. This also tries to be versatile, and its haziness gives the songs a lot of associations- they seem to be songs from sex, science, philosophy, absurdity, and to god knows what else.Once you get to know the songs, they wont be too enigmatic; they have this secret of revealing enigmas through time."
5,enigma...the long anticipated...#4...(of course 5 stars...),"Oh boy...I just listened to the Gravity of Love single...and it struck me right to the core...so powerful and emotional...as all of Michael Cretu's work. I've always liked that Micheal has changed the style for each of his albums...so much more diversified...life long fans of Michael cretu have always noticed his flare for newer, differant things...from Sandra, Cretu/Thiers, and Cretu...all amazing work that he has done with so many people...this work should be just as good as the others have been for me...he is truly and amazing artist...though...his wife Sandra, I can give her such gratitude for her voice...BUY THIS ALBUM...NOW!"
4,enigma does it again!,"What did you expect but the best? Enigma/Micheal Cretu does it like no one can! The sounds are absolutely creative and stunning..diff. mood mixings...like the other 3 albums. If you are an Enigma fan, you will have to buy this CD or you are missing out!"
5,It just transfers me to strange and interesting places!,"I love enigma! This album is great. The use of ""O Fortuna"" is something that only enigma could have ever think of! This is a CD to listen to on a peaceful night with candles and no other type of light! It just transfers me to strange, intersting and mystical places, just like the one's in Tolkien's books."
5,Absolutely Breathtaking As Usual,"The release of a new Enigma album is always a big deal for me. I can still remember my reaction when I first heard ""The Voice Of Enigma"" on their MCMXC a.D. album. Well, all the wonder and emotion is still there with this truly awesome fourth album. It combines all the elements of Enigma with a new fierce sound. Adding to this is Micheal Cretu's sampling of ""O Fortuna"", which melds beautifully in ""Modern Crusaders"" (one of the best songs on the album) and ""Camera Obscura"" (a short, chaotic segue). You have to wonder where Cretu comes up with a new sound each time. The Screen Behind The Mirror is definitely one of the best albums out there now. Definitely check it out!"
5,The screen behind this mirror is beautiful!,"In anticipation for this upcoming album, I had been listening to the single ""Gravity of Love"", which was released prior to the albums release. The ""new"" sound by Mr. Cretu had me yearning for the album more and more. When the album was finally released, my ears perked up after the sounds of the first several tracks. I had to absorb and sleep on my first listening that night. It was very unlike the other three previous albums with its beautifully ""dark"" uplifting tracks, though some of the sounds were remenisent of the prior three, nicely tieing all the albums together. The next day, and there after, the melodies have enthralled my ears and my mind (along with co-workers and my employeer)where I now have three copies of this album- one for work, home, and vehicle. If this was Enigma's last album (as I wash my hands and my mouth out with soap for saying such things), what a way to finish!"
3,"A little dissapointing, if you've heard their previous work","If you have heard Enigma's previous works, specially their second album (Return to Innocence), you might be dissapointed a little bit. I was expecting something different and original. Sure, elaborating on top of Carmina Burana is original, but the way Michael Cretu did it was not what I expected. It's as if since album #2 he has run out of structure ideas!However, if you've never heard Enigma, you might find it a very nice album."
2,Much left to be desired,"What a disappointment. To begin with, the first track takes way too long to get off the ground, and the talking accompanying this track is very annyoing. I think Enigma is trying to be too enigmatic. Most of the rest of the c.d. was rather unappealing. There are a couple of okay tunes, but nothing special."
4,Chill Sensual Groove,"I love Enigma. I really love Enigma. ""The Screen Behind The Mirror"" is another great offering from this tight, creative ensemble. Whenever I want to kick it and calm down (which I need to do because I do get easily worked up my friends say) I put on an Enigma disc and fly. I don't know why it took me so long to get around to this one but I was not let down. I especially connect with ""Silence Must Be Heard"" and ""Gravity Of Love"". And I have to say, I really love the artwork on their covers. The visuals put me in in the mood for the aural experience.One big complaint: This CD is way to short!!!!!"
3,Enigma's Bombastic Fourth,"Egads...has ""O Fortuna"" not been sampled enough already? Appears not, as Enigma tosses it in his fourth album to the point of distraction. This is the least ingenuitive of the Enigma albums, and his most obvious. I'll admit, ""Push The Limits"" and ""Modern Crusaders"" are the best songs here, but if you have the first three Enigma CD's you have them all.I have often thought Enigma to be a later day Alan Parsons, trying to make his formula fit certain ideas and themes. And like Parsons, once he got past ""Eve,"" the formula began to wear thin. The same can be said about ""The Screen Behind The Mirror."" You like the formula. you'll like the album. But to me, it's just Enigma's craftsmanship on display this time. Without heart, craftsmanship is just learning to use the tools, and without any discernable effect."
4,A Good CD With A Few Shining Moments,"The Carl Orff composition ""O-Fortuna"" is the basis and undercurrent of this latest CD by Enigma's Michael Cretu. This CD is good to listen to as a unit, a symphony if you will. Trying to break most of it up into four to six minute songs doesn't work, as they all seem to flow together in a collage of dance beats and otherworldly textures. The best three tracks on the CD are ""The Gravity Of Love"" & ""Silence Must Be Heard""--both feature the vocals of Olive's Ruth-Ann--and ""Modern Crusaders"", which features Michael Cretu's own vocals. The inclusion of the choral work gives this collection of tunes a dark, ominous feeling, but it works to the advantage, and anyone into this kind of music should give this CD a listen."
4,ALMOST AS GOOD,I'VE ENJOYED THIS LATEST RELEASE FROM ENIGMA ITS NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST RELEASE BUT STILL VERY RELAXING AND SEDATING MUSIC TO LISTEN AND UNWIND TO.
5,The music of Enigma,"I have been a fan of Enigma for a couple of years. I have the first 2 cds, which are amazing. I just got ""The Screen behind the mirror today and I just can't stop listening to it. The music is just so enchanting. Some of my favorites are ""Push the Limits"",and ""Gravity of Love"". The whole cd is incredible though. I love how each of Enigma's cds have a theme and are different. It never leaves the listener bored. Enigma's music sends you off to a mystic dreamworld where total relaxation is the main concern. I love to dim the lights, lay back and just drift with the music. I give this cd 5+ stars. Once again, I have not been disappointed with Enigma. Buy this cd and take a Journey of the Mind...."
3,Another Enigma hit CD with a twist -- not as good as most,"I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Enigma's style of music -- however, if you are looking for something unique, groundbreaking, or more fulfilling than Michael Cretu's past 3 works, this is not the CD for you. This 4th major Enigma album rehashes old music, old beats, and old themes... the only twist is a harder edge, and some powerfully-hitting choral samples, as well as the welcome introduction of a great new female vocalist. Good music as usual, but disappointing in its inferiority to Enigma 3"
5,Excellent!,"One of the best by Cretu yet...great music and experimentation. I was immediately impressed by the entire CD, its a MUST have for any music fan. The only thing I felt missing was the deep underlying sexual tones that were always part of enigma music..."
3,It's an Enigma why this album wasn't perfect,"First off, this album has its high points and low points. And each time it ascends (or descends) to one of those, it goes farther than it ever has before. Case in point, the 2-track opening salvo of ""The Gate"" and ""Push The Limits"" is a magnificent piece. The Gate softly introduces you to the world that exists on this album, and seamlessly folds into ""Push The Limits"" which surges out from the background to take you along for the ride. And then the ride these 2 songs have taken you on hits some major turbulence with absolute clunkers like ""Modern Crusaders"" (which has decent music, but with Michael Cretu's lackluster vocals, the song's quality takes a nosedive). The other gems are ""Gravity of Love"", the title track, and ""Silence Must Be Heard"".....the others fit the categories I listed above, with no middle ground to be found. As a whole, this album is good, but it could have been far better."
5,Four Words - Cretu's Got it Goin'!,"I bought this album last month. At first, I felt that the album left something to be desired. I listened to Gravity of Love and Silence Must Be Heard, and thought, ""Hmmmm. These are the only good songs on the album."" But after going through the album again. I found that each track had a very different beat and feel to it. I must have listened to this album 200 times, and I still can't get enough of it. This IS my favourite album. EVER."
3,Not the Enigma we're used to,"While the CD has good and bad, the bad seems to outweigh the good on this one. It saddens me to say this is probably the worst of the Enigma albums. There are a few bright spots, but overall I was disappointed with the new release. The first three were awesome. The forth left alot to be desired."
4,Enigma's best album,"Even though Michael Cretu always uses samples, and don't chant for himself, like he did on one of the first songs on 'Enigma 3', this is Enigma's masterpiece, that is filled with folk music of all kind, classical choir music, modern day electronic music, and lyrics about sex and unexplained mysteries of our earth, and the outer space."
4,New to Los Angeles,"I`ve heard a quite alot of Enigma stuff. This is not the best they`ve released, but never the less its still good. Listen b4u buy."
3,Michael Certu - Running Dry?,"O.K, I like Enigma to... (Who doesn't?) and the first time i heard ""Sadness"", it really turned me on... I even uses this music for trances, and meditation - it's just right Screen behind the mirror starts with new and fresh songs, but after you pass track 5, the songs start reapiting themselves... you can hear mixes from old songs (like sadness) and a lot of ""sounds"" (like wav's..) that are ripped form the old tracks and put to the new ones. After I enjoyed the first part of the Album, I got really disapointed after a while. I realy expected more from the new Disk of Enigma, but it's seems to me that Michael Certu is running dry... If it took him 3 years to come up with only 5 or so new tracks, maybe he should quite while still remebred as one of the best."
4,One of the best Enigma albums yet,"I have loved Enigma since the song ""Return to Innocence."" Having bought all of Enigma's albums, I awaited this one anxiously. Cretu has definitely hit a high note here. While I will be the first to admit that some lyrics in the albums of the past have crossed the line into hokey new-ageism, all of the content here is worthy of thinking about. The music is also great, mixing familiar Enigma sounds with exciting new samples with the voice of Olive's Ruth Ann leads to create the highlight of the album, Gravity of Love. It's a great song that makes me yearn for that often promised new album from Olive and makes me appreciate Cretu's talent to weave great music."
3,Enigma IV is here...,"Enigma 4... from the time I heard of its inception, I was compelled to see what Michael Cretu would offer us in what is now part four in his ongoing ""story."" This is a story without words, told with textures and rhythms. Sounds and samples. Heart in soul. Though not as good as ""The Cross of Changes,"" I would still recommend this to any fan of ambient music. There is a lot in this CD to be discovered. Enigma after all is a mystery"
2,"Long awaited, short lived","Not a terrible CD, but easily the worst of all four Enigma CDs. I was hoping to hear something new from Cretu, and the first three tracks really grabbed my attention with the operatic voices (in the past he used Gregorian chants). However, the remainder of the CD falls into uninspiring remixes and rehashes of the music styles and sound bytes of his previous three Enigma CDs."
3,Enigma Continues in its own Tradition,"Enigma has produced several albums over the years that combined unexpected elements like Indian chanting, Gregorian chants, and opera around a soft hip-hop beat and a whole swoosh of electronica. This CD does not see any new developments in the sound, and actually seems retro as it uses ""O FORTUNA"" from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana. That piece seemed to resurge in the 80s in movies like EXCALIBUR, GLORY, and THE DOORS. There is already an excellent dance remix of the piece floating around out there! If you like Enigma, by all means buy this CD. If you don't know Enigma then you need to start with the one with SADENESS on it. By a long shot, that is the BEST Enigma CD. This one continues a tradition, and honestly I could not tell it was new other than the inclusion of O FORTUNA. But if you liked any of the other CDS...this one is a safe bet."
3,"Good, but previous Enigma works are better","After seeing all of the glowing reviews of this CD I made sure to listen to it a few more times, but I still don't think it is as good as the Enigma's previous works. It is definitely a good CD, and has some great tracks, but some of the vocals just don't appeal to me.The liberal use of the Carmina Burana throughout the CD was a surprise. At first I thought it was a bit too much, but after a few more listens I really enjoyed it and found that it was integrated well (and interestingly in some cases) with the other music.For the diehard Enigma fan I think this is a worthwhile purchase, but new Enigma listeners should try some of their previous CDs first."
5,Athletic Body in Balnce,The book is very good.Gray Cook explain his method simply and it can help me on my job.I did really a good choice.
3,Too short,This dvd for being that old is quiet expensive and quite short as well. It only covers the screening test and progressions and a few core works. It just falls short to the content that's in the book. And Gray doesn't even really talk during video some other guy does which makes it really boring. If you have a vhs just get that one instead is cheaper.
2,Decent book,"This book was ok, but it was fairly basic in ideas. I was looking for some new functional training ideas and the ones covered here can be found easily elsewhere. Unless you can get it for a great price, I'd spend my money elsewhere."
3,Good reference,"Funny how a book needs a DVD to help demonstrate. So get the DVD too. Not much to say other than a good reference, the value is in the whole book."
1,Depressing,Lindsell appears to believe that true Christianity requires (regardless of its date or provenance) a belief in a modern doctrine of inerrancy. Perhaps of some limited use for those wondering how the biblical text could be taken in such a way (quite creative at times) but otherwise just grim stuff.
5,Reliable equipment,"I've had a set of these inexpensive 2-way radios for several years. Can't buy them retail anymore. I wanted to expand the set and this was a great, inexpensive way to do it. Great for birding with a large group!"
3,Missing some key herbs used in US,Also missing info on Chinese herbs. I bought it to look at microscopic data. Not all herbs used commercially in the US are present in the book. Not all entries have photo references...the test directs the reader to look at other texts. What is present in the book was a good and helpful reference. My issue was with the info that was missing..
1,Worst book I've bought on Amazon...,"$58 I could have given to charity or something. Buy Back to Eden if you want a good herbal book, this was, well I said it in the title of this review Worst book I've bought on Amazon. Try:HERBS THAT HEAL Rx: Prescription For Herbal Healing By Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D.; Janet A. Weiner, or MEDICINAL PLANTS OF THE DESERT AND CANYON WEST - By Michael Moore... anything but this...."
1,Fire Hazard!,"This cord is a fire hazard! My son just knocked over our shredder which forcefully unplugged it from this particular extension cord. Not a big deal but what happened was that the cord's end piece broke apart, exposing the naked contacts which subsequently caused a small firework of sparks behind my cabinet. Thanks goodness it didn't start a fire! Goes right in the trash. Don't buy this junk!"
5,Hilarious!,"It Is the real escence of the football. Fanatics life mixed with a real love that overcome differences. If you want to have a relax after a hard day, watch the movie."
2,Barely watchable,"I'm really surprised at the level of enthusiasm for this flick. I was barely able to make it the end, and instantly regretted that I bothered to do so. Pretty mundane acting all-around, especially from the muttonchopped fellow. At least it has Robert Forster in a couple of scenes, looking fairly amused by being in them.Really, this movie is not the best gangster flick since ""Scarface."" Please. It's basically just very much a B-movie, with low funding and hammed-up acting along with ludicrous premises. Expect to see this VERY late some night on the USA channel. Don't hesitate to switch to Howard Stern of the Home Shopping Network."
3,ehhh...skip it unless your an obsessed Viggo fan,This movie was okay. It had its moments...some of then lack luster some of them decent. The acting was average. The script was basically nothing special. Honestly I got it just to see Viggo who looked incredibly cute so I guess it was worth it...Best on mute.
3,B action film but good Mortensen,"This is not stretching any boundaries in action films, but a good early leading role performance by Viggo Mortensen."
5,one of my favorites,"This movie is about honor, and family. Although the director tries to show a parallel between the Italian mafia and the Japanese yakuza, one glaring difference stands out. The mafia is held together by fear, while the yakuza is held together by loyalty. Honor, family, and loyalty: Three things we all can use more of. The Japanese cultural tradition of honor leading to tragedy runs throughout. An inspiration."
2,Oversensitive mic,"Easy to use and setup, but the mic is way too sensitive. If you tone the mic down, the sound gets really muffled. Overall, I was really disappointed with the product."
5,Works good,"This was purchased for my father who has Multiple Sclerosis, and has trouble getting his voice loud enough for others he hear him on the phone. This has worked well for him, with the amplified voice.We connected it to a regular corded phone and lift the corded phones handset whenever he wants to make or answer a call. He speaks and listens through the headset.It was a little confusing to figure out how to setup at first though."
2,SUPER/ALIENS,"I haven't read the book, but it seems starnge to put Superman agianst Aliens. I like the aliens books, but i'v seen how weak they can be, plus acid isn't going to hurt Superman I meen the guy dived into volcanos for crying out loud!"
3,An okay book.,"Though a weak story line, the art in this book is great. Superman believes he may have found a beacon from krypton and goes off to find the planet it came from. Once he arrives on the planet he is attacked by an Alien and saved by some teenage girl. The girl explains how the aliens arrived ...Superman has some code of honor ... that prevents him from killing the aliens, even though they are wiping out the planet's inhabitants. Bad on many levels but still readable, buy it if you have some extra bucks."
4,Nicely done,"Superman vs. Aliens? Say what? Yep, and it works well thanks to Jurgens' competent story-telling. Clark Kent and Lois Lane, as guests of Lex Corp., witness the landing of a probe seemingly of Kryptonian origin. Supes then jets off in a hyper-craft to investigate....only to discover the probe was from a civilization *similar* to Krypton's -- and has been decimated by the Alien scourge. As Supes' power wanes, he and a girl that he has encountered must find a way off the corrupted asteroid. Neat ending which should not disappoint."
3,Superman meets his match,Superman goes to a location where he is slowly losing his super powers...who does he meet? The monster of our nightmares. An interesting story but I thought it could have been better.
3,Love Dyer not this book,"It may be the formatting as one reviewer mentioned but even the quotes in this book seem to be stretching. Not a lot to say, love the Author don't like this book very well."
3,Interesting,It was interesting but my expectations were greater. I enjoy Wayne Dwyer. There are lessons to learn in all his books.
4,A realistic gritty account of a fight already lost.,"I found this novel to be surprisingly gripping and accurate. The characters moulded by Carroll were not over the top as one so often sees in this type of tale.The story trots along and keeps your interest throughout. I did find myself getting some of the characters muddled at times, but all sorted itself out in time.Whether or not readers were 'out of nappies' during the Vietnam War, I feel they will enjoy this work a great deal."
5,It is REALLY great,"Ok, now I'm a Transformer fan who has been looking for these for a LONG time, now that I found them, I don't wanna let them go. When I saw the Beast War toys, I only wanted to get the toys from the show, with these, I want them all. He is fairly easy to transform and has pretty good durability. What I don't get is how he can fly in robot mode if his wings are his legs. Also, He has a bit of a weird side as his legs have high heels (that's something to think about). All in all, he is great and I suggest strongly that you get him"
2,So horrible it's painful.,"This was the first Maximal I bought from the Beast Machines line- and, for several months, the last. I wanted the Vehicons to win, if this is all the designers were capable of. Buzzsaw is flimsy, unstable, and a pain. The gimmick is forgettable, and it's not worth the price point it's at- if it goes down a few bucks, and you want to complete your collection, maybe you should consider it- otherwise, try some of the better Maximals, like Snarl, Night Viper, or Black Arachnia."
4,It's the orange one,"I was a bit annoyed with the spring on his upper set of arms. Also, that part of his body with the wings and tail coming off is a bit hard to manage. The thing I loved about it was the fact that the joints pop off and reattach with mildly excessive force, so between that and the screws I was able to take it apart and turn it into a non-transforming bugbot with better articulation. (imagination abounds) The joints do get a lot looser if you pop them apart too much, though. Great for posing, okay for play."
4,"Maybe not the best author, but a good read just the same.","This true story certainly does share the pain and misery with the reader. The author did a great job of getting it all out there. Many of the stories of how it was in the 50s at school, home and in small communities was fun to read and accurate as well. At the end of the book there are several resources that are interesting. Really gives you the feel of what it was like to be in direct harm of atomic fallout, but at the same time... told to believe you're just fine. Should be a good lesson for all of us."
1,STAY AWAY!,"Mind numbing laundry lists of dates and squadron losses presented in narrative format, making it incredibly boring to read and impossible to use as a reference. No maps or tables, and a lot of information is repeated through the book as though it hadn't been edited. STAY AWAY."
5,A very helpful guide to putting eating perspective.,I found this book provided practical advice for understanding the emotional content of eating and for learning to deal with these feelings more directly. It helps you to define your personal eating patterns and provides guidance in changing those patterns. Dr. Abramson does not dictate what you must do but aids you in taking control for yourself. It was pivotal to my recovery from emotional eating.
4,Tierney did it again,"This coloring book presents 29 fashion illustrations from 1863 to 1910, including wedding and coronation fashions of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, bathing outfits, women's undergarments, ""Aesthetic Look"" of Oscar Wilde, six outfits for children and many other.The pages are thick enough for gentle watercoloring. Coloring Tierney's fashion illustrations is always a pleasure.I enjoyed this book, but unlike many other Tierney's coloring books with 45 illustrations, this book offers only 29 illustrations for the same price.However, if you are into this period and love coloring, I guess you wouldn't regret this purchase."
4,Exactly what I'd hoped,"After purchasing a number of adult coloring books, this book finally gave me the coloring experience I was looking for. The drawings are very well done, and they give a wide representation of styles available during the age. Will probably purchase again. The reason I gave four stars instead of five is that if you use markers, it bleeds through the pages, making the other side impossible (or messy) to color. Otherwise, it's an excellent purchase."
3,Covers Fashions Only Through 1910,"I expected more of this coloring book of Late Victorian and Edwardian Fashions from Dover Fashion Coloring Books. I need all the illustrations I can get from the time period 1915-1919 --- during the First World War. Though this isn't strictly Edwardian since it's after 1910 and is in effect during the reign of King George V, it's still considered to be Late Edwardian. It comes right before the fashions of the Roaring Twenties when skirts got dramatically shorter. I'm disappointed that only 9 pictures are Edwardian at all and the very last one is called ""Dressed for the Tango 1910"". That's five whole years before the fashions I'm looking for. I went through the inventory Amazon has in the same series and couldn't find one later in time than this coloring book. I think Dover needs to do fashions throughout the Twentieth Century."
3,Late Vicotrian...Fashion coloring book,This book is a bit too simplistic for the adult. Probably more for a teenager or maybe an adult who is just starting to color again. I am really interested in fashion coloring and wish there more books out there. I've gone through what is available.
1,This album must go.,"To be quite frank, this album was a huge dissappointment. It had no furious guitar riffs, nor any smoldering sets of funk. This album really has no potential and will not hit the charts."
1,yawn,"I don't know much about the history of this band, nor do I care to learn after listening to some of this record. Terribly boring and uninspired. Obvious and tired chord progressions and musicianship. Vocal melodies are the type that come off the very top of your head without putting an ounce of thought into it; the type that are probably the perfect average of every single vocal melody you've ever heard throughout your entire life."
3,i guess its okay,"i used to like this cd a whole lot better. it hasnt aged too well. i dont like the production very much. one good thing: now that james doesnt have to sing richey's impenatrable lyrics, it sounds like he actually has a clue what he's singing. one bad thing: richey's lyrics were, taken apart from the songs, quite devastatingly good. its about half great, half eehhhh."
5,Their Masterpiece,"""Everything Must Go"" is the closest the Manics ever got to their dream of making a real masterpiece. While their earlier Sex Pistols/Clash sound was fantastic, they have struck gold here. Ít took me a while to fully get into this album, but it was worth the effort. Listening to ""The Holy Bible"", it is hard to believe that the same group was capable of this. The real standout tracks here are ""A Design For Life"", ""Kevin Carter"", and ""Interiors (Song for Willem De Kooning)"". Lavish, orchestral at times, and more grandiose than anything they have done before. Not for everybody, but a treat for those who can understand it."
4,Excellent product for the price,Purchased this product for my mothers cell phone to replace her broken charger. Order this and delivered fairly quick. It charged the phone pretty fast too. No complaints. Great product for the price.
5,The AC charger for Motorola V170 cell phone worked great,Prodect came within 5 days and has operated as it should. I am pleased with this product as well as the price.
5,Works Just Fine,"It charges the phone just like it should. :). A lot cheaper than buying it locally.It arrived on time, actually earlier than I thought it would"
4,Great customer service,"The product I ordered was not compatible with my phone, but I did contact the company to let them know the issue and they sent me a refund ASAP. Great service!"
3,Not again...,What to say? What do I say..except Oh My Lord and I think I'm starting to hate FearlessGaia is still keeping Sam a scret from Ed because she knows Ed may be in danger if he knows.Ed and Gaia are drifting slowly apart. And Ed's getting sick and tired of it...Tataina is now the FOH's new leader (it was hilarious seeing her drunk and now I want her dead)Heather is truely a new person...And Jake is still cofusing me...I want to slowly and painfully kill Sam again and again. I burst into tears when I read Ed's final commentary. He can't hate her. They are meant for each other. I know it. What can I say except I'll just have to wait and see what Shock has in store for us.
3,what is up with sam coming back?,"i love the fearless books. there supenseful and more. but i hate that sam came back. i was sad that he ""died"" but gaia finally got over him. i love that ed and gaia got together and everything was going pretty good for. sam ruined all that. gaia also has to learn how to trust gaia. i though that 24 betryed was the best book of the series."
2,Not good for quick reference.,Found this book unhelpful for quick reference to specific problems that needed to be solved. Recommend the Quickstart publisher book for better reference while building. I will still keep it for lingo references in back. Comes with a CD.
2,Not for newbies,"Want to know how to stop a movie from looping? Not here. How about getting transitions to run smoothly? Nah.If you haven't a clue what Director is about - walk away; this book will not help you. It assumes much too much of the reader. On the other hand, once you have some idea of the Director paradigm and have made a movie or two, then I would add this to your bookshelf."
5,Agatha Christie An Autobiography,Absolutely fascinating book about one of the world's most famous authors. It includes a cd of Agatha Christie's voice which is a great bonus.
5,My Favorite Book,"As an avid fan of Agatha Christie, I wanted to read her autobiography. I couldn't find it on Amazon.com or at the local public library. Finally, I found an old, tattered copy in one of the Rutgers University libraries.This book can change your life! Not only does Christie recount her life in an interesting and exciting way, but she also comments on a wide variety of comments -- friendship, parties, poetry, marriage, etc. Many times, I find myself quoting the wisdom Christie has included within her book.This is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it. I could not put it down; it was very interesting, especially because of the aforemention edinclusion of her comments on every imaginable topic."
2,A Review of the Format . . .,"I just downloaded this ebook offered by HarperCollins and was dismayed to find that there were absolutely NO pictures included!!!!!!!! I was extremely disappointed that in this day and age a complete version of this work would not be offered by a major publisher. I checked a copy of the original book published by Dodd, Mead in 1977 and available for FREE from my public library - and found that it included 26 photos . . . sooooo . . . where's the pics??? Just another example of the greed by major publishers to rush a product in an e-format and think that no one would notice . . . what a ripoff!!!!!!!! Beware of what is offered in ebooks . . I do love having the accessibility . . . but not at the cost of content."
5,A window to another life,"I randomly picked this book in a library - I was looking for something to read and this seemed interesting enough. I had no idea how captive this would be. Agatha Christie doesn't write, she paints beautiful portraits with her words. From the moment I picked up this book it was impossible to put down. The way she talks of her life (and of course, her life itself) is truly enchanting. I don't think I could ever do this book justice, but I assure you - time spent on reading this book will be time well spent."
3,My review,"I thought this was interesting, however I felt way too much time was spent on her childhood. It got pretty tedious."
3,A good conventional story,An Autobiography.A lot of historical interest. Conventional autobiography. Of interest for Christie-fans. A good story about victorian up-bringing and the values pertinent then.
2,Boring!,"The book is soooo very boring one might think she only wrote it to annoy her first husband, it goes on and on about her second husband Max and his excavations. There are some funny bits but the book is truely redundant and says very little about her actual detective stories. Try Cecil Beaton's biography so interesting and alive."
4,Simply Beautiful!,"Until I read this work of AC, I never knew someone can make you interested in their life so deeply. As most of her fictions, this book wins with one virute. Its simplicity. It is clean, down-to-earth and so so wonderful. Isn't she beautiful? So full of LIFE."
4,What an interesting life!,"We selected this autobiography as our book club read - and were a bit disheartened about the number of pages. But once I started I got captured by the language and what an interesting life Agatha Christie has led. Travelling all over the world and so critical about her own writing. She also has comments about life that I found profound and interesting, I would recommend this book to my friends."
4,Geat watch - Tiny Date,"I have had this watch about a month and I wear it about twice a week. I bought it because it met my criteria of a white face, visible at night, and had a date. (The chronogragh was just a bonus for me.) It is a fine watch and well crafted, but I was disappointed with three things. First, the width of the bezel really takes away from the size of the face. Second, the luminescent markers are not as bright as the Luminox website led me to believe they were. And third the date is teeny weeny. The things I liked were the overgrown case it came in, the knobs and locking push buttons are super smooth and well made, and finally the leather band is first rate."
4,sheep family,"not sure why this family should cost so much more than others but my little one likes shawn the sheep and this is ""his"" family"
2,looks great but does not do the job,"Hello, I was a student at LCTI for carpentryWhen our class got this package in, we had put this base molding along the bottom 90 degree joint where the floor and walls meet in the newly built closet that had been sheetrocked and spackled then painted. Before we started my class, I, and my teacher figured this would be a faulty product, because the present base molding was cut in 4 foot sections. Well wouldnt you know it the darn stuff dont stick where and when it's suppose to."
2,You get what you pay for,Cheap product and you get pay for easy to use but vary thin that is why its easy to work with put after I was done it looked bad and won't use this co again
3,"Useful, practical, and fun","This is a great book! I found it engaging, entertaining, and very practical. The writing exercises suggested by the author are very powerful and really do work! Following the guidelines in the book resulted for me in the release of endorphins and an overall feeling of well-being. The only trouble with this book, is that you must never lend it out, because, your friends will never return it. This is the third copy that I have bought. I would recommend it to persons suffering from chronic illness. It is also very helpful and instructive for any health care professional."
4,Awesome for looks. Fast shipping,I love this windscreen. Looks great and you can really get down and look through it. Also does really well when at higher speeds as it diverts the wind right over your head. The only down side is if you park your bike in the sun to long it will start to melt the gauges from the angle the bubble comes up. Other than that i love the double bubble. zero gravity.
3,Okay,"These volumes are okay, not as good as the earlier volumes but still great MXC fun. Volume 4 is better than Volume 5 because they change the format of the show, I recommend Volumes 1 through 3 very highly. Every time I run across that Wipeout I get in the mood for MXC and recommend this over that any day."
5,MXC,"ITs great watching asians from the 80s fall and do other odd things while being dubbed over, its great tv"
3,I had a problem with a few scratched discs but everything turned out fine.,"I had to return the first set back to Amazon because a few disc was scratchedThey sent me out a new boxset and everything was fine, Amazon stood by their word and took care of the problem."
5,I'm an MXC Addict.,"The humor gets funnier every time I watch it. There's just nothing like some quick-witted quips to accompany people bailing out into big mud puddles. It's a great season, just like all of them. I hope to own all of the MXC seasons soon. It is more adult jokes than anything, but that's because it's shown on SpikeTV here. But everyone can enjoy the fantastic attempts that people hurl every few minutes. Very fast-paced show, so pay attention and you'll be laughing the whole time!"
5,One of the funniest shows out there.,"Great show, I love the voiceover actors on this show. The show is hilarious and I believe it was the basis for wipeout. I would definitely check this out."
3,What's up with the DVD? Help!,"Has anyone but I had trouble with accessing the Langue section of the Menu on Media Asia DVDs? I returned one, thinking it was defective. However, any DVD I own from Media Asia is the same: It seems as if it's entering the menu and then just ""bounces"" me back to the main menu! The rest of the menus are fine; only the Language is this way. Thanks. Scangemi@ohpny.com"
4,"funny, but needs more action","The quintessential ""hopping vampire"" movie. The plot revolves around an undertaker and his assistants, who are called in to deal with a corpse that is in danger of turning into a ""vampire"" - it was buried with a bad feng-shui. I thought the flim was very funny. While it has great and unique fight sequences, I wish it had more. Silly but fun."
4,Hilarious,"This was one of the funniest movies i have ever seen. The only downside were the white subtitles which were difficult to read at times, but even those couldn't keep me from laughing through the entire movie. I had never seen a Hong Kong style movie before this one but now i am hooked. SEE THIS DVD! Invite some friends and have a great laugh."
3,Usefull Game-Masters reference,A good adition to any serious Gamers reference library. A must for game organizers.
3,If only sound quality was better,"This headset phone is exactly what I need for my home office. I do not understand why the sound quality on this is so poor compared to a normal cheap handset phone (and yes, I've tested with cheap handset on the same line). This phone adds a fair amount of noise (more of a hum/buzz). With volume & tone control (a nice plus), it is usable but still annoying. If they improve this phone to have normal basic handset type sound quality, I would give this product a 5."
4,bigwhoop,"I have been taking them but honestly I don't know if is working..I'd recommend it either way, can't go wrong with vitamins right"
4,"Solid, w/a few drawbacks","Coach Wade's book is a very good starting point for organizing a program. It has a wonderful collection of materials from which he has drawn his knowledge, and he willingly shares these. The book also is a wonderful tool for organizing practices and for thinking about your coaching philosophies.The main drawback is the cockiness. Many times Wade uses humor to mask the arrogance, but it still slips through unmasked in many cases. For many dyed in the wool coaches, his style will be little noticed. But, for the sideline-dad-thrust into the action, the style may overshadow the substance if not forewarned.Of course, the book rightly has no offensive or defensive strategies. Instead, it is devoted wholly to how to organize a youth football program. Overall, it is a wonderful asset, and if not for the style, a perfect 5. As is, it stands as a solid 4."
2,Not very helpful,"If you are looking for a book to help with football fundementals - such as offensive and defensive lines; running your drills, etc., keep searching. This book spends too much time (first 200 pages) on extraneous information."
5,nicer than expected,"These are a little larger than a typical ""keychain size"" that I was expecting. They are really cute and well made."
5,Brazilian caress,"This is an album for a sunny warm afternoon, a hot summer evening, or a rainy day when dreams are needed. Gilberto's voice is smooth as silk, and the songs on this CD are gentle and relaxing, while at the same time hot & exciting. It is like a trip to the beaches of Brasil. Ahhhh, Brasil!"
5,Yes completely amazing!,Astrud Gilberto is a important legend of brazilian Bossa Nova and she is still singing faboulus with her cool voice!
5,Awesome,Great Music from the anime if you watched the English dub might be unhappy with it since its the original language but the basic music that you love is still intact so buy it all ready
1,Garbage,"I have never in my life struggled so much to operate a digital camera. I have some experience in hooking digicams up, but this was the absolute worst. The instruction manual is terrible, this thing has horrible battery life, and the picture quality is unacceptable. Spare yourself the trouble and don't get this camera. This was just another corporate screw-up."
5,Wonderful Manga!,"This is a great shoujo manga for any girl. I loved it! All though it lacks a little bit of action, it is still good. Both romantic and adventurous, I recommend this to anyone who likes a good shoujo."
3,Love comes in different ways,"This book is about a girl (miaka)with an strict mother. She runs away to a library and is sucked into a magical book. She meets a male hero named xong giu-sui (Tamahome) She turns out to be the priestess of a mysterious land, and loves Tamahome as her hero. He, on the other hand, is destined to protect her, and loves her like a little sister. But when a mysterious and mean woman comes to the palace to help miaka with a royal quest, she falls for the emporer. The whole story is romantic, yet strange. :S It's not that great, but I read it twice.-Mangafreak"
4,Cool!,I just started liking Fushigi Yuugi. Now I'm obsessed.I have almost all of the DVD's. They worked really hard on this so BUY IT! *Cries* I can't make you. This show is really interesting. I reccomend the other books and DVD's. I also reccomend InuYasha. It's alot like FY.
5,"Exquisite artwork, and a captivating story","Yu Watase has to be my favorite manga artist of all time because her illustrations are beautifully detailed. This series is a mythical tale of the adventures of Miaka (aka Suzaku no Miko)and her gorgeous (**drools** ^_~) seishi as they try to summon the god Suzaku. In this installment Miaka and Yui are drawn into the Universe of Four Gods, and are saved by a handsome stranger (with a lust for money ^_~). After returing to the modern day world, Miaka re-enters the book, to find her hansome stranger, and so the adventure begins. If you are looking for a manga with beautiful pictures, romance, humour, plenty of bishonen, war, frienship and betrayal (in other words a GREAT story) get this series. You won't regret it."
5,What can I say? AWESOME!,"I loved this book! And for what reasons? Well, I loved the characters... either you hate them or love them.. but they're so wonderfully detailed and complex that I loved them all! And soon as you read the first two pages you're immediately hooked... You can indentify with Miaka, and so you're transported along with her in her journeys. Her situations you can indentify with... and so you feel a connection not only to her but to the entire story as well. You find yourself falling in love with the characters. When you put the book down after finishing...well, in my experience... you yell out, ""I WANT MORE! "" (that's why there is the Oracle handy...) Believe me.. Fushigi Yuugi is worth every single penny that you paid for it"
5,"Fushigi Yugi: The Mysterious Play, Vol. 1","I am a fan of the Fushigi Yugi series since, well forever! The story is just awesome! It`s romance, action, adventure, and excitement all jam packd into one story. If you love the great artwork of Yu Watase, you'll love this!"
5,Warning if you buy this book you will want more.,This book is about a girl name Miaka she is a chipper junior-high-school glutton who is trying to get into the exclsive jonan high school to please her mother. when she gose to the library she gose to a room that says do not enter she entered it because she saw a fire bird. Right in the middle of the room was a book name the univers of the four gods. She started reading it and it said if you read this book you shall be sucked in to the book and after the book is done you will get to get a wish. So Miaka and her freind yui started reading it. So they got sucked in the story. When they opend there eyes there were outside and these people got there and started hurting them when this boys with a sigh on his forhead that red demond saved them then all the sudden the girls teloported back to the library. But when they returend they opend there eyes and there were 2 fighures and they said.....................
4,Don't like putting America into it,"i liked this manga. the story is a little different than the anime, which is cool. for instance miaka and yui get sucked into the novel, but come out together!!! miaka goes back into the book later without yui's knowledge. what i didn't like was putting american things into it. like ""denny's"" and ""jesse the body ventura"" i would rather have the original japanese things, and if we don't know what they're saying, putting a little editor's note at the bottom. it was set in japan afterall. but otherwise it was cool. if you liked the anime you should read the manga to see the differences in the stories."
5,A Chinese/Japanese NeverEnding Story,"Wonderful story full of magic. It can most easily be compared with The NeverEnding Story by Michael Ende, complete with a magic book, joining the story, and friends and foes. The manga illustration is wonderful, though a bit 'busy' at times. Recommened for anyone who loves a good fantasy tale with magic and mystery."
4,Romantic,"This book was very romantic and entertaining! I really liked the action parts, since there was usually a lot of romance mixed in with them. I do think that some parts were unnessecary and simply used to add some inappropriate content to the book. Being that I love romance, this was one of the best Japanese comics I've ever read! For me to truly enjoy romance manga (and I know I've said this before) the main boy has to be someone that I would like if I was a manga character. Tamahome reminded me of Darien from ""Sailor Moon"", risking his life to save the main girl! It was those parts that I enjoyed most.Overall, if you love romance and Japanese comics, I recommend this to you! It is very absorbing and enjoyable! But keep in mind that there IS unnessecary content such as Tamahome walking in on Miaka when she's shirtless."
5,Definitely a recommended manga!,"If you are interested in manga, I would definitely recommend Fushigi Yuugi; in a lot of ways, it reminds me of Sailor Moon, but only because the main character is a young girl studying for her entrance exams. Other than that, the storylines are very different. This manga (Priestess) is the first in the series, and it introduces Miaka and her friends, so this is definitely the one to get if you are interested. I'm pretty sure that you won't be disappointed in this manga; it's very funny and entertaining and the artwork is beautiful!"
3,Not Tilt's best work,"After listening to 'Til it Kills, I was hooked on Tilt. Cinder's vocals were great and musical variety on that CD really held your ear. By comparison, Viewers Like You was dissapointing. There is definitly a historical theme in the lyrics, which is a bit different... but gets old really fast. The songs seem uninspired, the lyrics too straight forward for my taste (they don't make you think) and the music nothing new or noteworthy. Maybe it's one of those albums that'll grow on you, but buy at your own risk."
1,Poor DVD Treatment,"Why Cant They Just Make One DVD Of this And Stick With it and do it Correctly for Example The One I Have is Called Count Dracula and his Vampire Brides ""The American Title"" But on the Movie it self It Says Dracula and His Vampire Brides ????"
4,"Fun, Energetic, DMB Struts its Stuff!","In Listener Supported Dave Matthews Band has once again released a fine Live recording. The sound quality is fabulous, and the band is in good form on this album. Exceptional songs are Jimi Thing (with the phenomenal sax work by Leroi Moore), Two Step (the extended version gives a feel of earlier DMB concerts when the band was so comfortable at Jammin'), and The Stone. The songs off BTCS are welcomed on this album, and complement the older songs such as Warehouse, and Rhyme & Reason. Moore clearly steals the album on the sax, but solo performances by Carter Beauford (on the drums), and Boyd Tinsley (on violin) are borderline esctasy. Only reason this album isn't five stars is the setlist. Such favorites as Lie in are Graves, Dancing nancies, and Crush are missing from the album, but give DMB credit for playing lesser known songs such as #36, and True Reflections, both of these songs rock."
5,Find myself coming for more..,"I found this DVD to be excellent, although this was an indoor concert. It seems to be a mellower concert, but a great deal of energy is still there. The camera views are absolutely excellent, and the crowd is going nuts through the whole DVD. I would definately recommend this, great show."
4,Not the Best Effort but Good Nonetheless,"At first I enjoyed this a lot, but once I listened to it enough times it got boring, it has all their slow songs, and it really doesn't sound like they're doing their best. The jams are still fun though.The DVD is much more enjoyable. The new ""Live at Chicago"" has to be their best live album. ""Live at Luther College"" a close second.So my opinion is to get the DVD and not waste your money on a double CD with less content and the same price. I give ""Listener Supported"" four stars."
2,Could Have Done Better,"After seeing this concert on PBS I was a little disappointed with what PBS showed and I was hoping the entire show would be better than what PBS decided to air. Unfortunately it wasn't. After listening to this show it sounded to me like the band was tired and the energy most fans are use to just wasn't there. They did however play some songs I was excited to hear but on these songs (granny, #36, and true reflections) they had the ""stay girls"" sing with them. Now I don't really have anything against these girls but they just don't sound good with band on any song with maybe ""stay"" being the exception. I love hearing the band live and perfer live albums over studio albums. I have a lot of taped shows ranging from 92-99 and there are so many other shows they could have released that would show there true talent and energy on stage. So to sum it up it's not that bad but they could have done a lot better."
2,good concert- but not anything to get excited about,"The songs sound somewhat different than what many have heard and thats good. WAREHOUSE>CRASH>RAPUNZEL>TOO MUCH>GRANNY are the best songs on here. Other than that its just like the other two live albums. the crowd gets into it, but that doesnt make up for putting this concert onto a CD. Dave needs to wait a few years before putting out another live album. Get in the studio and get some NEW SONGS first. I'm sure it was a good show, but save your money and go see the concert yourself. If you want a good live album, buy PHISH: HAMPTON COMES ALIVE. No 2 Phish shows are alike and you get much more bang for your buck. DMB is very talented and is worth seeing, but don't let that force you to buy this album. However; if you are a diehard fan and have to have this, to each his own."
1,Off the scale,"Dude, One star means excellent, right? Not only is he amazing but you have to respect his talent. I learned that from subliminal messages on all of his CDs. If you listen to Crash, Dave says: ""Dude, I am so talented; you have to respect me. Buy all my albums and get the Dave Matthews check book cover from ebay, dude.""P.S. In reality, Dave, much like his music is highly overrated. Instead of buying this CD, I recommend a ""good CD."""
2,Insipid,Absolutely skip this CD if you were one of the fortunate ones who got to see DMB perform before 1995. What they've done to #36 is depressing. Apologies to Chris Hani for having been sold out on this particular album.
5,Dave Rocks!,"This is one of the best DMB CD's I've heard. I highly recommened getting this if you haven't. If not just get all their CD's because they are the best. It has other songs that you haven't heard before which are exceptionally good, and songs you've know since their first CD which are really good to. I rate this CD high and all their other live CD's (Red Rocks and Dave & Tim)."
5,Screams Classic DMB,"One of the better live albums, Listener Supported is a brilliant portrayal of work to sum up DMB and their miraculous year. Although it isn't as great as Live At Red Rocks, it's still up there..And it's lookin' down at all the other bands of today. I wish the setlist was a little stronger, but it all came together with me, for the cover of ""All Along The Watchtower."""
1,Nice but for Kenny G audience,Very big disappointment. DMB can do that much better. Strictly commercial
4,IT WONT LET YOU DOWN,"I was mislead at first because I was told that this was a new album and when I first realized that it was yet another live album I was a little upset. However, DMB never fails to produce a great sound and great appeal. While the live Red Rocks CD is hard to beat, Listener Supported puts out some great competition. I have enjoyed this creative mix of wonderful songs and talented music."
4,"Great, same old dave","This is a fantastic album--it is the expected Dave Mathews performance. Though it is good, we have heard the same songs many times before. I have all of Dave's official CD's and I am hearing nearly 50% repeats. While it is a good CD, I think you should spend you money elsewhere. Listen to you other Dave CD's."
5,WOW...the only word that can describe this CD...,"After I heard the first track I knew it. This CD would be worth it. The musical harmony on the opening jam catches your ear, and you're hooked for the next 2 hours. Many critics will come after the dMb, saying that releasing the same songs over again is just a money making ploy. But anyone who has heard all the dave CD's knows...it's the blending, the transitions, and the different version of classic tunes that keeps the albums on top of the charts. Listener Supported does feature some fan faves, like Crash into Me (which happens to be the Dixie Chicken version.) But more importantly it showcases rarities like #40 and True Reflections. Not to mention the cover of the Johhny Cash song Long Black Veil. All in all, this is a small price to pay for the caliber of entertainment recieved in these 2 CD's. Buy it, and go home happy."
2,It's time for something new Dave,"I have every CD Dave Matthews has put out. I was eager to listen to this when it came out. I played it once and put it away, I may give it away. He does do justice to The Long Black Veil, but that is about it. Watchtower is much better on Redrocks that it is here. Warehouse, Jimi Thing, and Rhyme and Reason AGAIN! I surprised Ants isn't on this CD. Go back to the studio and work your magic a couple more times before you ""bless"" us with yet another live CD. And when you do, don't record in New Jersey for crying out loud. He has put out more live CD's than studio CD's. It is also very clear why he does covers of Veil and Watchtower, it's because he doesn't have enough of his own material. If you have Red Rocks that is all you need."
5,Impressive live cd,"After listening to this cd a couple of times I realized why I like the DMB so much. They are really talented. This cd, much like there other two live recordings shows that they can improvise and create music on the go. I don't think this is quite as good as 'live at red rocks' but it does hold its own very well. I don't understand how all the reviewers for the magazines can review music and not include the DMB as one of the great bands of the decade. This album speaks for itself and anyone who likes music that sounds awesome should pick it up. Some songs that are great are 'crash into me,' 'all along the watchtower,' and '#40.'"
5,A completely different sound,"Once again Dave Matthews and his band have reinvented themselves, and their sound. This new album, while containing almost all old material that has been previously released, has a completely fresh sound. I attended a concert during the same tour, and bringing in Butch Taylor on keyboard was a great decision. The band has a full and rich sound on this album, and it sounds completely different than their other live offerings. I would highly recommend it to all DMB fans, and especially to those who don't have the appreciation for the band yet."
2,Just what the world needed...,"OK, first off let me say that I have always been a fan of the DMB and have seen them numerous times in concert, but I just have to ask, was this album really necessary? I have to wonder why musicians this creative and talented want to keep reprocessing old material in lieu of--gasp!--an actual new album that includes no previously recorded songs. Of course, DMB fans will run out and purchase this and they will all love it, so if you are a DMB disciple then go for it. But if you want to get excited about the DMB again, this is not the album that'll do it for you."
3,"Not bad, but much of the same thing....","If you are a big fan of Dave Matthews live albums, then this album is a must-have. If you simply wish to have one Dave Matthews live album in your collection, then this is not the album for you. In general, this is an awesome concert, but every song sounds much like its studio album counterpart except that it might be a few minutes longer. There are quite a few songs that the album would be better off without: Too Much, The Stone, Rhyme & Reason, for example. But there are a some incredible moments on this album that make you realize just how talented the Dave Matthews Band is, for example, #41, Rapunzel, Two Step, and Watchtower. These moments make up for the mediocre ones. If you are a hardcore fan, buy this album."
2,Enough Live Albums of the Same Stuff Already,I think Dave Mathews has been hanging out with Yanni or something. Both of these artists seem to put out an abundance of the same songs on different albums. This is Dave Mathews 3rd Live album and it is about time he came up with something new already.
2,A major let down from a band with lots of talent,As a long time fan of DMB I must say that this release was not their most successful endeavor. The music lacks the passion and energy that the band normally projects during their shows. The show was so pitiful that after hearing the first few songs I was literally brought to tears wanting to reach into my speakers and give Dave a good slapping. The band sounds tired and the songs drag. I would not recommend this CD to people that are not familiar with the band's work. This release will turn you away from the band for good. The show's few highlights would be the dixie chicken version of crash and #40 though it isn't really Captain of My Ship. I would only recommend this CD to avid fans of the band that just can't live with themselves if they don't own every one of DMB's albums.
5,Jazzy,"This is my favorite Live Dave cd because of how jazzy it is. I have never heard Leroi so good in any other live cd. Every song is so instrumental and huge solos from many instruments. The jazzy solos from the flute, saxaphone, clarinet, piano, and violin are out of this world. Not to mention Carter and Dave busting out in a couple songs. Sure Red Rocks was the first which to some people automatically makes it the best live cd but instrumentally which is why I love DMB this is the best live album."
4,A Softer Side of Matthews,"If one were to match the live albums of DMB to their studio albums, this is definitely the live answer to Under the Table and Dreaming. Accordingly, just like UtTaD, some people like the different, more mysterious and less driving feel of Matthews, some don't. This album have no really week spots in my opinion although the backup vocals did not impress me. This Album does have some cool rundowns: Two Step is very nice, and Long Black Veil also adds some flavor to the recording. I just didn't like the different flavor as much, and if I had a choice on live albums, although they are both good, sadly I would take Live at Red Rocks over this one."
3,"Get ""Red Rocks"" instead","OK, I love Dave Matthews Band as much as the next person. Actually, the fact that I'm such a big fan is probably why I don't like this one all that much. First, Dave slurs his speech so much it sounds like the dentist left the cotton balls in. Second, a lot of the versions of the songs aren't exactly spectacular (why is ""Rapunzel"" so slow?). Finally, how about some variety? We already have live versions of ""Crash into Me,"" ""Two Step,"" and ""Rhyme and Reason,"" (in some cases multiple times) but, there are no official live recordings of ""So Much to Say,"" ""The Last Stop"" or ""Crush."" And then they wonder why bootleggers do so well."
5,Another great CD from DMB,Truly captures the essence of Dave in concert. These guys just cannot make a bad CD. Over two hours of great music including some rare songs: this would make a great gift.
3,Dave-Always Awesome-But Why the Same stuff?,"Ok,a Dave fan, I am. Pictures adorn my dorn room and numerous bootleggs and sold cds fill my cd holder. I love attending concerts and listening to the groove of the band and the sexy voice of Matthews. Live music is definately the best. But why the same songs? Don't get me wrong, I love All Along the Watchtower, Crash, #41,etc. But I need to hear some new stuff! The Dave Matthews Band is a unique blend of rock, jazz, and world-beat rythms. A melting pot of music uncomparable to anyone else. But it's time to put out another hit cd!"
4,Buy this only if you cant get the DVD!,"While this is spectacular in its recording, and the songs played, it is just not a CD that fits into heavy rotation in your listening. The DVD is absolutely wonderful, a definate favorite in my collection. But being spoiled by actually seeing the show on the DVD as opposed to listening makes this CD less than a ""must have"" in my book. Dont get me wrong... if you can afford both, go for it. But if you have the choice, the DVD is the way to go."
4,Worth the money,"This is a very good cd. And has a very different sound than many of the others. The funk laced version of ""too much"" is the best I have ever heard, and it is a treat to hear rare songs like #40 and ""true reflections"" the latter shows that boyd could front any band. if ""seek up"" and ""ants marching"" were present it would be perfect. Great work DMB."
4,"Pretty darn good, if you ask me","I always get pumped when DMB put out an album, especially a live one. So I ran out and got this during it's first week of release. Truth be told, I was a little dissapointed with the setlist, but I reasoned that the newer songs deserved to be on it and that this album couldn't be another Red Rocks. And admittedly it is not the band's best, but I have enjoyed it very much and would recommened it to anyone who enjoys the band, especially the songs of Crash and BTCS"
5,Simply Amazed . . . .,"I recently got both the album and video versions of Listener Supported and I am simply amazed by both. Both are outstanding. The set was varied and entertaining - I love the fact that there are songs from each album, along with songs that have not been released. Hearing a DMB song in a new way is always enjoyable - I love hearing the keys and the backup singers on so many songs. Outstanding! I recommend this CD highly. Now, about some of the reviews after mine. The fickleness of DMB fans simplay amazes me. Someone complaining about Boyd singing? I saw Boyd sing John Prine's ""Angel From Montgomery"" a few years ago and it was fantastic. Complaints about the ""Lovely Ladies""? My goodness - they have three fantastic voices. The end of ""Long Black Veil"" gives me shivers. Quit complaining and just listen! This CD belongs in your collection!"
4,Dave Matthews just keeps satisfying,"Although i have over 50 Concerts on CD of Dave Mathews with Tim, and with the Band, I still had no problem paying the $17.99 for this new disc. I watched the concert the night it aired on PBS, and i couldnt wait to get ahold of it. Even though i have every song on it in 4 or 5 different forms, its still a new concert. And for those of you who dont trade concerts, you should def. purchase this concert. I thought LBV was a nice change of pace, as well as it was nice to see Ants didnt make the cut. I'm Looking forward to Dave's new music which is supposed to be recorded in January."
3,Half-rate DMB CD,"I'm a fan of Dave; I own all but Recently, and Listener Supported is a subpar album. Having recently listened to several bootleg recordings of concerts I finally discovered what a good concert sounds like, and this concert was not good; it is more like a studio album on stage, and the songs are no different. I really love the bootleg recording I have of #40 (not sure from what concert), but the recording on this album is too short and doesn't compare to the other. In conclusion, while this is not a terrible album, it is so-so for DBM. Buy it if you have no other DMB CD to buy, but I prefer the studio albums and Luther."
4,I'm listening,"At first I was rather skeptical, because of a lot of previously released songs. But I couldn't hold out any longer. I bought this at the begining of the summer and I'm glad I did. It's got a great Granny with the lovely ladies, an awesome Watchtower, Two-Step, a funky Too Much, I'm glad I got it, it is good but like everyone else am eagerly waiting for the next studio release...."
4,Good.. only good,"This CD is good, but not as good as previously released DMB cd's. I really enjoyed DMB's version of "" All Along The Watchtower"" but I feel several of the songs were made longer through jam sessions, several of these jam sessions were good but others were just a long waist of space. DMB is an excellant live band but i feel it is time they release a new studio cd rather than just live material."
3,too much audience noise,"A nice compilation of tunes, but so much crowd noise, that the intro (song 1) is not even heard. Spend your money an another live CD by DMB. The annoying applause and screaming crowd are heard throughout the 2-CD set."
3,PERFECT FOR ALMOST EVERYONE,"Being a huge dave matthews band fan, i have come to expect only the best from this amazing group. And althought this album isn't their best, it is still quite amazing. I strongly recommend it to all those people who like the band but aren't huge fans. If you haven't heard dave matthews band before, this is the perfect cd to start listening to them with. As soon as you finish the third song, you'll be dying to see them live."
5,Listener Supported: I Wish I was There,"I have heard some negative points on this cd;comlaints that have been about no new songs, same old stuff. You shouldn't call urself a dave fan if that is how you feel. The jimi thing jam session is some of their best work."
5,"Dave couldent have been better, he was great","He is great in GRANNY, I love the hom ha who hom ha who mmm daba mmm daba mmm daba mmm... I love it how he has so much to say but he spends his time repeating it. When he invites the lovley ladys on stage hes so cute when he yells THANK GOD. Well it couldent have been any better. I am glad I bought it it is totly worth it."
3,"great, but not as great","Dave Matthews Band is without a doubt one of the most amazing and underrated musical entities in history. Us Dave heads, we know whats up, but many just hear them on the radio and forget about it. How many artists can really make you FEEL the music? Dave can. Anyway, the new live album was a really good listen. Long Black Veil being a stand out. I would give it five stars, but when I listen to red rocks, wow. Its just not as good. Excellent choice, buy it anyway, but if you don't have red rocks you will be missing out."
3,Snoozing,"I love the Dave Matthews Band and I feel that this CD was not really much of a great album. This CD is full of long jams, which are really only enjoyalbe at a live concert, not in the car or your room. The setlist is mediocre and the songs are slow and seemed to drag on forever. They are missing some really good songs like Dancing Nancies, Halloween, and Typical Situation. All Along the Watchtower is on there but Dave seems to hold back, not really getting emotional in the song, which he is best when he does. This CD is needs a better setlists, less jams, and more emotion. If your a Dave Matthews Band fan, try buying Live at Red Rocks and Live at Luther first"
2,"If you have Other Live DMB, this one's a rerun","I am a huge DMB fan from way, way back and typically love their live stuff. If you have red rocks and luther, you will not find much new here and in fact, may be disappointed with some of the arrangements.Let's do something new guys!"
3,Not as good as it could have been...,"I'll admit it: I wanted to see them perform more of their hits. The set chosen for this video is boring, when viewed as a whole. The music is different, in that it lacks the structure of formula pop-rock hits, but these songs just drag on and on. The audience seemed very subdued, in much the same way as when I saw the band in Tampa last year. At least then, I got to see them perform some decent material. This video is definitely for the hard core DMB fan."
2,I'm Questioning Dave,"While I am a huge fan of Dave, I am so dissatisfied with this CD. Its the same songs that I have on SEVEN other CDs. Enough already. I originally liked Dave becuase of his unique style and creativity- how many more live albums are you going to put out Dave? Granted, there are a few good songs. In my opinion- even if you are a HUGE Dave fan, dont waste your money."
4,Not too bad,"In my opinion this cd had the potential to be just another live album, nothing special. I currently have a collection of 46 full dave shows ranging from 3.4.91 to now 9.11.99. So i didn't expect much when i first heard of the possibility of a new live album release. However I was plesently surprised to see a decent rendition of #40 followed by LBV. I think a better show could have been chosen but i can't really complain. The jam at the end of #41 is amazing as usual. Good version of #36. Dissapointed to see don't drink the water. Overall a good show, but also nothing to be all to excited about."
5,"From God, To Dave, To my Speakers","Dave Mathews again masters the performance of another live performance in his latest CD Listerner Supported. Being a rather large fan, I'm biased, but the music is superb even without the phenomenal Tim Reynolds (not to knock the other incredible musicians...but hey - it's Tim). A GREAT collaboration of songs from many of his CD's performed in the ambience of an enthralled crowd. I'd give it more than 5 stars - definitely my favorite CD(s) right now."
5,The Best of What's Around!,Back in the summer when I heard that the DMB was coming out with a live album sometime soon I was just counting down the days til it came out. In my opinion this one is better than Live at Red Rocks. When I heard Long Black Veil I knew this was going to be the only cd I would be listening to for awhile.
3,Why this show?,"I'm an ardent fan of tDMB, but once again Red Light has chosen to release an average show as a live release. Why do they choose a show with gospel singers diminishing two songs (Granny and #36), with a sub-par setlist and performances that are nowhere near as good as the band is capable of (ie: Dave's raspy voice on a few tracks, and weak soloing on a few numbers). Most of the shows the DMB did this summer and last year are better, and shows such as 5/30/98, 8/9/98, 11/21/98, 6/26/99, 8/1/99 would be welcome live releases. Alas, the best shows remain in the vaults or in the hands of bootleggers. Here's to the day when Red Light releases a show where the band lets loose, plays a unique setlist, and they actually play songs off of Remember Two Things! Til then, i'll stick to bootleggin'. I'm not whining here, just disappointed because they could do much better."

5,Need a map when you don't have GPS,"Need a map if you don't have GPS - and sometimes if you do. GPS is not always correct. Visited Baltimore area for extended time. Loved having a map book in the car - especially when stuck in traffic and needed an alternative route. Book fits into pocket on back of seat. Spiral bound book means no maps to unfold and then try to refold. Also means the print is large enough you can read the street names - and ALL of the streets are present, not just major ones."
5,"Breathtakingly cool stylings, Never dull or predictable","I had this on vinyl when it first came out. You cannot not like this album. Morgana's covers of the then newer songs are wonderful interpretations. The original ""Jennifer Had"" is lovingly sad. This is a great intro to anyone who is just now getting to know Morgana. For us old fans, that soft voice is caressing our ears over and over again. Here she moved away from the classic songs and it worked in grand fashion."
4,20 pages!,"I have no regrets about having ordered this ""book,"" thinking it an unfinished novel, but others might be well notified that it's only a short story, ""The Middle Years,"" from an unfinished volume to have carried the same name. At least this is what I've been able to discover from glancing online references.The best James is beyond price, and at $12.00 this was worth it to me, a semi-autobiographical sketch of an author at the end of his life, full of insights into the subjective mind of the author and containing perhaps the most widely quoted and passionate definition of art in our culture. But others may want to know in advance: this is a short story of a mere 20 pages, and not even the eponymous unfinished volume, which included other stories as well."

5,Great product--Great price!,Got the leather dog collar in 2 days! Sized right-leather soft. Color as pictured.
5,These guys wrote the book on early 70's Progressive Music!!!,"Things to Come is a fairly great album. A catchy beat here, a concept there, and you have a fine, but quirky album. The <<BIG>> Surprise is Psi-Fi. I was in a hippie underground record store checking the newest releases in '74. I spot that green xrayed eyeglass wearing skull cover art. Best album cover I'd seen. The tastiest is in the sound from your speakers. Quirky rock and vast Moog sythesizer sound valleys all coming together in a MiNd bLOw3nG Suite that rises to the top of a dense cacophony. Good sense of fun and night time mind wandering. ""Turn up the incense"" KABoooOOOO00000MMmm. ...better than the Shaggs, even today!"
2,It sucks,"I bought it this sunday for my father. And the remote control started out of work yesterday. The display color is so poor, it is definitely not true color. When using zoom in, the picture is really blur. Keep away from this product!"
3,Pretty good yarn,"Slocum encounters an old priest who knows the whereabout of a hidden treasure. At the priest's request, Slocum goes for a young nun whom the priest raised years earler. On the return, their paths collide with two different gangs, both out for no good.Fairly decent suspense and action."
2,wheres the hits we were waitin for?,"this album is a total disappointment. d'angelo is capable of so much more. ive been waitin forever for this and i only find 3 or 4 ""classic"" songs.....maybe i'm judgin him a little hard cuz i expect so much but if u liked his last album you'l still probably like this one but it'll leave you wondering where he hid the best cuts! haha"
5,An Awakening for R&B Music,"This is not just another R&B album folks. D'Angleo has truly come through with a very powerful and spiritually conscious album.There is jazz,hip-hop,soul,love,hate, God, and upliftment throughout this album.Aspiring artists and entertainers, please learn from this album. It is what music it to be about. D'Angelo has filled a soulful void with Voodoo. I think no one can argue that this album will be one that will be loved and admired by the world for years to come. Thank you D'Angleo."
3,D'Angelo does his best Prince imitation,"I have trouble listening to the album all the way through because I get annoyed at his blatant attempts to sound like Prnce/The Artist. The little speech in the album jacket suggests that Prince should be inspired by this album. What an ego! It's obviously the other way around. I know it's customary for recording artists to draw on their personal favorites for inspiration, but there is a fine line between inspiration and imitation. The songs are good but they are good ""Prince"" songs. One would think that in five years between albums, one could find his own voice/style."
4,D'Angelo is back!,"For all you music lovers out there who are receptive to an array of music, than D'Angelo's cd, Voodoo should be in your music collection. Let me first say that I was taken back when I first listened to Vodoo because I thought it was different from his first alblum, Brown Sugar. Vodoo is a concotion of R&B, JAZZ, BLUES, LATIN and just pure FUNK. Although all of the song on this cd are part of the ingredients for D'Angelo's spell, there is one song that I believe makes this cd complete, Spanish Joint. You can hear the DRUMS, GUITAR, CONGAS, and every other instrument that makes you want to get out of your chair to dance. Take it from me, If you haven't purchased this cd you are truly missing out"
3,different is not always good,"D'Angelo dares to be different, his freshman album, with Brown Sugar was EXCELLENT. Unfortunately I expected something that would far exceed that album. This album makes me think he is a Prince Prodigy. Many of his songs have that Prince- do me baby feel to them."
5,D'Angelo What a Man,"I am just in love with D'Angelo's new CD. I am really sorry that I missed his concert in New York this past weekend. He really knows how to sooth a woman with his music. I am just overly thrilled with this new CD. I just can't wait for something else from him. All of my friends know just how much I love his music. The owner of the neighborhood record shop always laughes when he sees me because I have been asking for a lifesize poster of D""Angelo ever since this Untitled has been released. I just really love his music. I would be so greatful if you don't use my name because my man might think that I love D'Angelo more than I love him."
2,Uh?,"The songs don't really begin or end, they sort of drift into the room and drift out. The vocals are extremely undermixed. Too much bass and drums. Too many slow songs, no energy, all pothead music, people just too stoned to do anything and laying around staring at the TV type music. Unmotivated, unmotivating, dull, sleepy. Listless. The rap bit in the second song is annoying but fortunately it's undermixed, like all the rest of the vocals, so you can barely hear it. And this goes on for almost AN HOUR AND A HALF.Some advice for D'Angelo: (1) CD's usually have songs on them, try to write some next time. (2) Stop smoking so much pot, it's affecting your music in a bad way. (3) Mix down the bass and drums, or if not, try to get them to play on the beat. (4) BUY A SHIRT ALREADY, OK!?"
4,D's back,Finally the new D'Angelo CD long awaited and well worth the wait. This Album is a funky mellow blend and is true D'Angelo style. A must have.
5,A album worth waiting for..simplicity of rhythm is essential,I love the vibe truly a music lover's dream...D'angelo is an artist who has the knowledge and the talent to become the artist of the decade...i hope that he keeps up the good work..
3,You do this voodoo,"3 1/2D'ange strives for a smooth but gritty, instrumentally-stressed, eclectic neo-soul masterwork and comes just short of lofty ambitions."
5,That Voodoo that he do!,"I bought this CD when it first came out and it has stayed in my stereo ever since. I had to listen to it a few times before I was really feeling it. I already loved Untitled (and not just because of the video!) and Playa, Playa was too infectious not to like, but after a while, I was digging the entire CD. Heck, I even starting digging Devil's Pie, which I didn't like when it first came out on the Belly soundtrack. Listening to those lyrics gave me a whole new appreciation for this man's artistry. Spanish Rain, featuring Roy Hargrove, is another of my favorites.D'Angelo has a masterful ear and isn't afraid to explore and meld various genres. This CD has something for everyone, Jazz, funk, Hip Hop. Voodoo is a classic. And I'm not loaning it to anyone."
2,Not really worth the money,"To start off, this CD does not display any of his real talent. If you want to actually listen to D'Angelo, purchase his first CD. This CD sounds [voodoo] sounds as though he didn't take enough time and energy to it. It sounds like it was rushed. Yeah, it did take him five years to come out with something new, but out of that five years, how long was he writing on this one, about 3 weeks? Anyways, what I am trying to say is, is that D'Angelo could have done much better than what he did on this CD. And to make matters even more worse, all the damn music sounds the same."
2,Elevator Music,"It's not a bad cd, but i wish he would project his voice more. It just sounded like gibberish all the way through the cd. I like R&B artists that when you hear them, you have to stop and go ""Whoa, who was that?"" whereas I could hear him on a closed elevator in the dead of night and wouldn't pay much attention."
4,D'Angelo continues his steady climb to greatness with Voodoo,"I really looked forward to this LP, and for the most part, I was not disappointed. This is a very, very good LP. D'Angelo accomplishes the goal for any rising artist: to develop range and maturity while at the same time maintaining a signature ""sound."" However, some great jams like ""Playa Playa"" and ""One Mo'Gin,"" fall prey to the same problems with Brown Sugar: they go . . . on . . . too . . . long. And in my opinion, the album is a tad too-bass driven, and the intricacies of the production are lost in the deep grooves.That being said, there are several outstanding tracks on Voodoo, including the aforementioned ""Playa Playa,"" ""Spanish Joint,"" ""Chicken Grease"" and ""Untitled."" D'Angelo makes another tight joint, and I look forward to stronger efforts in the future."
4,Very Solid,"Now that Outkast has the stage, it may be worthwhile to examine this record once again, four years later. I'm listening to it right now, and must confess that this is an excellent R&B/Soul album, with excellent compositions, gorgeous singing, and infectious hooks. It also explores a broad tapestry of R&B styles, which keeps things mixed up and flowing.D'Angelo takes time in between albums, but there's obviously a reason. This is a high quality SOUL ( I never did get what ""neo-soul"" was ever about) album, one that would please D'Angelo's influences as much as his audience."
5,nobody does it better,"Voodoo is a masterpiece. D'Angelo is obviously a disciple of the ""less is more"" school of musicmaking. He strips away all unnecessary noise, flourishes, solos, and other distractions until all that's left is simple, tight beats, throbbing, buzzing bass, and funky vocalising that manages to be both hot and cool at the same time. Almost every track is good, with a few standouts like The Root and How Does It Feel. This is a super, super CD and I just can't seem to take it off my CD player. Very worthwhile."
4,"Classic, smooth retro soul and motown","It's as if Marvin Gaye and Al Green were still pumping out new music in their prime. D'Angelo has the best male voice in popular music today. His voice has that rich horn-like quality that Marvin and Al had and he can hit the high notes at will. There's one great track after another and surprisely there's more of a breezy jazzy feel to the album than a modern hip hop groove, even with guest appearances by Redman and Method Man. D'Angelo lets the songs take their time to develop so nothing seems rushed which, you will see, is a nice change from most music which is designed for 3 minute play so as not to upset the radio commercial schedule. Given all the above, it's the rare album that gets better and better with each listen.Only criticism I have is that the first few tracks are the only weak ones on the album and lead to a slower start than I would like. Oh well, just hit ""random play"" on your CD to take care of this."
4,D'Angelo is back!,"For all you music lovers out there who are receptive to an array of music, than D'Angelo cd, Voodoo should be in your music collection. Let me say that I was taken back when I first listened to Voodoo because I thought this cd was very different from D'Angelo first cd, Brown Sugar. Voodoo is a concoction of R&B, JAZZ, BLUES, LATIN and pure FUNK. Although all of his songs on this cd are part of the ingredients for his spell, there is one song that I believe makes this cd complete, SPANISH JOINT. You can hear the DRUMS, GUITAR, CONGAS, HORN and every other instrument that makes you want to get out from your seat to dance. Take it from me, you are truly missing out if you haven't bought this cd"
4,"funky, smooth and cool","great, soulful album from the first song to the last it flows with funky styled hip-hop to smoldering soul this is what i call a soul album not a classic, but satisfying remy shand fans this is real r&b and it meets my standard for what was set by sly and the family stone's stand in 1969."
4,a great cd,"Love the sound of this mans voice, it just oozes....like warm honey, now if i can get it back from my cousin, who loves his music i would be even happier!"
2,"TOO LONG,NO POINT","With all this talk of critics calling D'Angelo a genius,I wasexpecting ""Voodoo"" to be one of the year's best.A blend of fearless funk and top-drawer lyrics.And what did I get? Anoverlong,boring,and quawky sounding album.D'Angelo's falsettois beginning to sound like a cat yawning,in other words' he needs a new singing style.Now I have to say that ""Chicken Grease""and ""The Root"" may be good,but other than that ""Voodoo"" isbasically just one,long,redundant 78-minute track."
4,( Look Closer at ) The American ( R & B ) Beauty,"Yes, it' s the title of my Voodoo review.Look closer through the veneer, deep down to the core, then you' ll find his genuine talents just right there. DON'T let his rough, macho, street look that best fits the G-rap category turn you off.Or you' ll miss a thang, very essential thang for any R&B music fan.Voodoo obviously showcases D' Angelo' s promising career and amazing talents through his crooning vocals and ably instrumental skills, and proudly put him into the bright light mainstream once again.If you like the way he temptingly croons in "" I Found My Smile Again, "" then you will love this album.D' is here to stay for quite long, and we all know that. Let' s just hope 05 years from now he' s not gonna change his show name to somethang like TAFKAD ( The Artist Formerly Known As D' Angelo ) !"
5,"IT'S ABOUT TIME! DAMN! ""D""","THIS ALBUM MOS DEF PUT THE ROOTS ON ME, IT MADE ME FORGET THAT IT TOOK YEARS TO COME OUT! ON THE REAL THE ALBUM IS BANGIN'! WORTH THE WAIT. ONE OF THE HOTTEST ALBUMS SINCE LAURYN ~> MOS DEF ~> ANGIE STONE ~> ROOTS ~> JAZZYFATNASTEES.... THE FACT THAT D HOOKED UP WITH THE BADDEST DRUMMER ON THE EARTH qUESTLOVE AKA AHMIR SHOWS YOU HE PUT HIS FOOT IN THIS JOINT. i WISH HE BLESSED US WITH A DUET WITH LUARYN MARLEY, BUT THAT'S WHAT REMIX' R 4. (SHE OWES HIM ONE DEFINITELY) THE COMPARISONS TO PRINCE ARE COMPLIMENTS TO HIS GREATNESS. ARTIST & D'ANGELO DUET IN THE FUTURE? SOUND LIKE SOME GOOD SHI.....! ON THE REAL VOODOO IS THE BOMB! GET THIS ONE IT'S A BROWN SUGAR GROWN'D UP! DESPITE THAT WACK SHI.... BY MEF & RED THE JOINT IS PHAT! PEACE, Q CHECK OUT MY NEW BOOK/CD/VIDEO OF WORDS: ""LIQUID LOVE"" COMING IN MARCH! PEACE FREE MUMIA IN 2000!"
3,I must be missing something,"This CD is on more year-end 10 best lists than any other, so far as I can tell (ok, maybe U2 is up there as well). I don't know why. I love Prince, his most obvious influence, and Marvin Gaye, his other glaring influence. And I was prepared to love this record. But I don't. Marvin Gaye and Prince are/were able to maintain high energy and interest even in the most languid groove. To me, this one just falls flat. After repeated listenings, I just don't get what the fuss is about."
4,Classic but not perfect,"""Voodoo"" is satisfying for true D'angelo heads and almost every song is a gem, especially Untitled and Greatdayindamorning. But The Line is boring and Left and Right is really week, flawing what would be a perfect album from the new godfather of soul"
2,Could have felt you,"I am critized for this statment, bout' D's flow in his last creation. It's like he knows he is the bomb and nobody can touch him so he just kinda did what ever. He tries to sound like Prince on a few tracks. Now maybe I'm not in tune with my sixth sense like I think I am. After one week strait of trying to feel Voodoo...I thought it was doo doo and sold it to a neighbor. Now try to get his first one out of me, you'll have better luck trying to get me to believe Tupac is alive. You can play his first piece at any given moment, you can even catch an elder head bopping to the funky tune. I understand an artist must grow to challenge the audience as well as self. If it wasn't for Devil's Pie he'd woulda gotz no luv from the devine1. Let's just say he grew backwards, maybe he'll catch me next time."
3,LOVESEXYNESS 2000,"I REALLY LIKE THE WAY D'ANGELO FLEXES HIS CREATIVE MUSCLES ON VOODOO. I LOVED BROWN SUGAR MORE THAN VOODOO BUT THIS CD IS A GREAT COP! SPANISH JOINT IS ONE OF MY VERY FAVES CUZ IT IS LIGHT & AIRY. IT REMINDS ME OF HAVING BRUNCH AT A LATIN JAZZ CLUB ON A DRIZZLY, MID JUNE SUNDAY. I ALSO DIG ""I FEEL LIKE MAKING LOVE."" ONCE AGAIN, HIS RE-MAKE OUT-SHINES THE ORIGINAL! THAT SONG JUST SCREAMS ""SPRINGTIME!"" IF YOU DONT HAVE IT, GET IT & MAKE SURE YOU COP ANGIE STONE'S BLACK DIAMOND,TOO! THEY MAKE GOOD MUSIC TOGETHER!"
3,Almost a great album,"This is the kind of album you have to sit with for awhile. Dangelo has really taken to infusing his work with far more musicality and thought than on the last record (although it, too, rocked), but has made his songs more exercises in his ability to show off his ability than to simply entertain. Some good tracks, a couple of great tracks, but I won't be listening to it in 6 months. Strong ballads."
2,Strangely Disappointed,"I have listened to the CD over and over - it is missing something. I like Devil's Pie, Untitled and Africa cuts, but the rest of the CD loses me. I was prepared to love this CD - Brown Sugar and his live import are wonderful - but I'm afraid I can't."
5,Butta,"The man, the leader of neo soul has raised the bar ever so higher. While it took forever to get released, it was well worth the wait. I cant even begin to explain how awesome this CD is. If you dont have it get it. Straight Butta!"
5,Caught...,"This is the exact feeling I got when I popped this CD in the player. I could barely wait for January 25 to come and I must say that I enjoyed every agonizing minute when I heard this album. I have D'Angelo's first album, Brown Sugar, and was hooked from then on. This album is so different, but every song will have you bopping your head to the beats. I find myself rushing back home to listen to it over and over again. If you get this cd I promise you won't be disappointed. With songs like Send It On, One Mo'Gin, The Root, Spanish Joint and Untitled you can't go wrong. :)"
4,LOVELY,"I am incredibly pleased to own D'angelo's Voodoo-while it won't make music history it does give me something to look forward to after a long day at work. On the other hand I do wish that his songs weren't so heavily entrenched in organ music. While this is D'angelo's trademark, it makes some songs sound repetitious. Overall-still a great and worthwhile buy."
5,A Star is born,"Voodoo will undoubtedly go down as an R&B classic. Backed by an amazing bunch of musicians (Pino Palladino, ?uestlove), D'Angelo channels Marvin Gaye and Prince while coming into his own. I love the beginning of ""Devil's Pie"" and the groove of ""Chicken Grease"". Having seen him twice on this tour, ""Untitled"" is even better live. One by one the musicians leave the stage, leaving just D'Angelo at the keyboards."
1,"Melody, anyone?","After hearing all of the comparisons to Marvin Gaye and Jimi Hendrix, et al., I thought I would give this a listen. I can sum up my feeling in one word: boring. Don't believe the hype. There is not a single song on this CD that even begins to have something close to a melody. Not a single ""song"" on the whole mess. Cluttered, confused-maybe. Soul? I don't think so. Want something soulful with good music, strong songs-buy Macy Gray and steer claer of this amateur wanna-be."
1,SHOCKINGLY BAD,"heres a man with all the talent in the world, yet he disappears for FIVE years and all he comes up with is this poorly written, produced and performed mess. What does that tell you?this album is unlistenable. its NOT ""brown sugar"". not even close. the songs are all the same, they're all dull, they're all too long, they all feature d'angelo mumbling all over them. not an enjoyable listening experience.BUY BROWN SUGAR AND STEER CLEAR OF VOODOO."
1,Double disappointment,"I bought the Voodoo CD the first week it was released. I had been checking and waiting for it's release. It has been a long time since I was this disappointed with any music purchase. I failed to screen the purchase in advance because I had heard 'Chicken Grease' on the Chris Rock show and I am a huge DeAngelo fan. I have tried to sell this CD to two different people, however after they hear Voodoo they refused the ... price tag. I warning you save your money."
4,Gee_ Money,I think this album is quite exceptional. It definitely was worth the 4+ year wait. D'Angelo's striking falsetto has matured greatly during his hiatus. This album is a must for any hardcore R&B fan!
3,Not Quite What I Was Hoping For,"I'm obviously in the minority in finding Voodoo to be a bit of a disappointment. I loved the intimacy of Brown Sugar, the way he made it sound as though he was singing just to me, and that is clearly absent from this album. D'angelo has instead gone for a very produced sound with plenty of layers. He obviously wants the sounds to wash over the listener instead of engaging them. There are few tracks that really stand out, but that is intentional. I admire D'angelo's experimentation and sheer talent but I miss the sexy, more personal sounds of Brown Sugar."
3,Untitled (How does it feel),This song is the best on the cd.I love the slow easy listening mood setting tone.
3,It's Alright,"This is a pretty average cd. It doesn't compare to Brown Sugar, but it's something I would listen to. I thing D'Angelo could have done better considering the amount of time he had."
5,Excellent product,"I stopped using regular (chlorine-bleached) tampons maybe 5 years ago after learning about the possible adverse health effects. These tampons are great. There is absolutely no difference regarding quality with any major brand-name tampons, and I feel much safer. They are a great buy, especially when you figure out the amount spent for these vs. similar organic tampons at a local health-food store. I like to support local business, but I am not wealthy and have a hard time paying $8-$9 for a box of 16 tampons. Give me a break! I just wish that Amazon would carry these in the ""with applicator"" version, which Seventh Generation makes. I like to have both on hand. Buy them."
5,Chemical free cotton,It's incredible to me why any woman would want to buy the standard store tampons with all the chemicals added to them. Why use other products with their bleach whitened chlorine when this is a perfectly natural eco-friendly alternative? My wife uses these and she swears by them.Seventh Generation is a very good company and they offer three absorbency sizes. There are a lot of tampons in the box (240) but you will not have to buy them again for a while or just split a box with a friend.
4,Good for the Earth and Your Hooha,"It doesn't make sense to me to stick pesticide doused blobs up my lady parts. I hate pads more than most. And as possibly the only hippie child that theDiva Cup Model 1 Pre-Childbirthsoooo did not work for, organic tampons are where it's at for me. I can by them at Whole Foods for seven dollars a pop or I can buy a year's worth here and save thirty-something. No question what I do.I love that the tampons are small and discreet, both in box and as small shrink-wrapped white objects floating around your purse.They are comfortable to use, and have a secure string. My only con is that I sometimes feel that they start to leak a smidgen before more conventional tampons, but that may just be in my head. I recommendImse Vimse Sanitary pads 3 pcs, Organic Panty Linerto protect your lacies should anything untoward occur.Overall, if organic matters, these are your best option, at the best price."
3,Product review,"Without the applicator, this product is extremely difficult to use. I love seventh generation and the idea of a healthier tampon alternative, but I bought a mega pack of these and now I can't use them. I wish they would design them with a biodegradable applicator. Until then, I will be going with another brand."
4,Eco friendly but no applicator,I know it is not as environmentally conscious but I just have to have a tampon with an applicator. They are individually wrapped in plastic for ease to carry in your purse and work as much as you would expect - although maybe just a bit on the light side compared to Tampax. Seventh Generation is a top-notch company and for that fact I bought the product and give it 4 stars I just wish Amazon carried the organic cotton tampons that include the applicator that I can buy at my local Whole Foods.
3,sally rock,I have no clue why the band is called Sally. That's gotta be the uncoolest name ever. The music is just your typical hard rock that you've heard a million times. I don't listen to rock and roll like this anymore so you mine as well judge for yourself if the disc is worth picking up. The music is like AC/DC and Stone Temple Pilots combined. Sound good?
4,Strategies That Work: Teaching Comprehension to Enhance Understanding,"This is a helpful book with excellent information. However, it is written with an elementary school focus and you will have to adapt the information for your own needs if you work with older students as I do. However, I've found it to be a good resource."
5,Best comprehension book on the market,This is an insightful book with regards to teaching reading comprehension. I believe it truly focuses on the differences between comprehension skills needed during reading and comprehension skills students use for application. I would recommend this book to anyone.
5,Great Practical Resource,This book provides lesson plans to use with specific trade books to model comprehension strategies with your students. The authors are staff developers who model the gradual release of responsibility format with students of different grade levels. I definately recommend the appendix which sorts books by topic and strategy.
4,Great Product,"Strategies That Work: Teaching Comprehension for Understanding and EngagementBook came fast and secure. Almost new, but did have some hightlighting.Would buy again!"
2,Some will find this useful,"Those who are engaged in the old 19th century assembly-line ""teachers pour knowledge into kids' heads"" education model may get some use out of this book. It actually does have a few nuggets of insight, but you have to wade through a lot of eye-glazing jargon and BS to get to them. But I have to wonder at the big picture here.It's no wonder, that kids who have their reading material chosen for them, who have to read the material using a filter prepared for them by the teacher from the latest edu-fads, who are to put sticky yellow notes through the text and regurgitate what the teacher apparently wants to hear... it's no wonder the stereotypical exclamation of a graduating teenager is, ""I'll never crack a book again!"" One suspects the great authors of the world never were subjected to ""strategies that work"" when they were children.I feel sorry for these kids."
1,outdated misinterpretations,"Hamer's findings are neither as groundbreaking nor as scientifically faultless as he wanted them to be. In fact, most of his results seem to be misinterpretations. A much better book about this topic is ""Reinventing the Male Homosexual: The Rhetoric and Power of the Gay Gene"" by Robert Alan Brookey."
2,Not what I expected!,"I got this toy for Christmas, and was so excited to open it. When I first did it, I discovered that I needed to close one eye to do it.The reflection sheet(or whatever you call it) breaks off all the time. This toy will make people very frustrated, unless you're a ""pro""."
4,Digi-Draw RULES,"My mother told me a month before Christmas that she purchased the Digi-Draw for my 4 year old daughter. I read the reviews and became very nervous. Well, on my daughter's first attempt, she had some difficulties and gave up right away. We brought it back out the next day and she did really well. I didn't have any problems putting it together, took about 10 seconds, and as long as you're in good lighting, it works great. She uses it everyday and loves it now. I think it's a great way for kids to learn to never give up, and have better coordination and concentration."
1,Waste of Money.,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas. She tried it butit didn't work very well. It was hard to keep open; the plasticlook-through page kept falling out and she couldn't hold it all still enough to actually trace the hard to see images. It's August and it's sitting on her shelf in ""like-new"" condition. What a waste of money."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought ""2"" of these, as we had a very long flight to Japan ahead of us and I needed something to occupy my 5 and 6 year olds. What a huge mistake! We got very frustrated trying to assemble them and even more frustrated trying to trace the images. If I could of opened the plane door, I would of thrown them out at 30,000 feet! What's really annoying is that I can't even return them as I bought them in L.A. and we live in Japan!"
1,Disappointed in Maryland,"My daughter saw this advertised on television quite sometime ago, and asked for it several times. We finally decided to buy it online, received it today (after much anticipation!), and she is completely disappointed. To begin with, the reflection plates don't actually snap in, as the directions say they do. Next, the reflection, while visible, is very difficult to trace. In fact, I had trouble, too! Last, after trying many different images (and thinking that the next one would be easier!), my daughter tried tracing an animated cartoon. I decided to line it up for her, thinking that would help get her started, and it was impossible to do! She is ten, and is quite artistic. This toy, however, has been nothing but a letdown! She feels taken advantage by the television advertisement, and doesn't want to try it again! We are sending it back tomorrow!!I only wish I had been smart enough to read these online reviews before we purchased Digi Draw!"
1,disappointing and deceiving,"My daughter, age 9, purchased this product after seeing on tv the many ways she could create images on paper as well clothing, backpacks etc. Upon opening and struggling to assemble it, we realized that it was useless. It is very difficult to use on paper and I can not imagine using it on an item such as a jacket. I emailed the company to complain and after 5 months they responded with a standard - return it to the store you bought it at (an option I did not feel we had since it had been opened and used). They should have just said ""tough luck (...)"". Save your money, avoid this company and get a bunch of stencils instead."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I agree with the previous reviews! It is very hard to do even though the commercial makes it seem easy. I got this for my 8 year old son, who loves to draw, and he was very disappointed. He was excited when he got it for Christmas because he had seen the commercials, and after a short time was very frustrated. I tried it myself and could not do it. Please don't waste your money!"
2,I've had this for ages!,"I got this when I was maybe 8 I lost it eventually, then I found it when I was packing up to move and it was broken from the weight of the books on top of it. I was gonna buy another one...but I had no idea how expensive it was. I don't remember it being so amazing because I don't remember ever going to look for it. But judging from the pictures I found with it, I sucked at drawing (still do) I do remember it being A bit hard to see the reflection and see what I was drawing. If it was at most 25 dollars I would consider to buy it. Neat idea though."
2,"once you get it together, it's workable, but...","The easy part was learning how to draw the reflection. Even then, it takes some practice, like perspective, but once you get it, it's pretty good.The bad part? The stupid plates do not snap into place easily at all. I am very glad other people have said this, I thought it was just me. I'm afraid to force them in because I just know I'll break it; I kind of have to get them to stay and then not move the board around too much to dislodge them. I went to the official website to see if there were instructions on how to insert the plates into the guides, I figured there was some trick to it, but on the site it just says ""snap the plates in place"" like it's the easiest thing in the world. WTH, company?Great idea, terrible execution. I'd ask for my money back but I got mine for a dollar at a garage sale. Even then, don't know if it was worth it."
3,Surprise! It really does snap in!,"Just wanted to review this toy on Christmas night after trying all day to get these plastic pieces in so they would stay, and searching the internet to find out what I was doing wrong, that they do in fact snap in. It took all day, but we finally did it! You have to put it on a hard surface, such as the kitchen table, and we had one person hold the thing while another applied quite a bit of force to snap the things in. It takes effort! Good luck with yours. My kids haven't even got to use it yet to rate it, but I was so excited we got them in that I thought I would share with other frustrated parents who may be searching for help this Christmas. Happy Holidays!"
1,I can't draw Dig-I- Draw,"This was a gift for my 13 birthday and I only used it once. It was hard to put together and now it will not stay together at all. I am very disapointed in the toy. I would not recomend this toy to anyone. My mom always tells me the best way to advertise is word of mouth well, I will give Dig-I-Draw alot of asvertisement not to buy it."
2,Toy breaks after second use,"This toy did keep my child's attention for a while, however it broke on the second use. One of the blue panels snapped and then the next day the other side did as well. I was able to return it to JCPenneys without a problem, but we did not buy another one."
1,NOT as seen on TV!,My 7 year old saw the ads for DigiDraw and drove me absolutely crazy until Christmas rolled around last year. The look of excitement and happiness on his face as he unwrapped this toy was short-lived.It was nearly impossible to assemble. The time and patience it required to 'trace' just a straight line was too much for an adult let alone a 7 year old. The only useable item from this entire toy were the colored pencils.
2,small bottles with poor packaging,"The item arrived seemingly intact, but one of the fragrance bottles was completely dry (not a hint of any perfume being there), which means that either there are quality control problems with their manufacturing and the fragrance was not even put in the bottle, or the packaging is faulty (and it does look flimsy at best). Since Amazon does not let you return items for such reasons, you are stuck with an empty bottle.In my case at least I had three others, but you might not be so lucky."
1,Did they not test these things????,"As with some other reviewers, my radios worked well at first, then died. The LED on the charger won't glow, so my problem may not be in the radios themselves (they BOTH quit, identically!) Can both adaptors be bad? (yes, I tested the outlets)"
1,Audiovox = Audiosux,Same problem as the others noted below. The batteries are of outrageously poor quality and it's difficult at best to find a replacement battery anywhere other than from Audiovox. They want more for the battery than I paid for the radio itself!
1,Battery dies and won't recharge and can't be replaced,"The battery died after about two days of use; it would not recharge. I emailed Audivox and Powtek (the battery manufacturer) and got nothing back from either. It's a shame because the transceiver device itself worked great, but the batteries are lemons, can't be replaced, and there is apparently no support.BUYER BEWARE!!"
2,so so,"The radios worked for two weeks and they were ok, though reception was a little staticy. But after two weeks one battery failed."
5,The essence of a man.,"This book is a poignant look at one man's search for his heritage, who his father was and what his father stood for. In doing so, Jamling seems to learn who he is as a man. The book is amazing as it weaves the son's story with that of his father's almost fifty years ago. It is refreshing to see that something as pure as a man's relationship to his father and our relationship to nature and faith still exists in at least one culture in a remote corner of the world. I am humbled by Jamling's deference to his father, heritage, and faith. My children will read this book when they are old enough to understand. I can only hope to leave half the legacy and example that Jamling's father has left and that Jamling will leave to his children."
3,Touching My Father's Soul,"Nor what I expected and rather a disappointment, this books seems to be a local writer and a son cashing in on the family name. There is little excitement or depth of character exhibited here and the work seems unlikely to be that of a man Himalayan born and bred. Who actually wrote these words ? Whose thoughts are they ? Not Sherpa thoughts I think.Far better is another book I have just read - Tenzing and the Sherpas of Everest by Tenzing's grandson, Tashi - an uplifting and honourable book about the Sherpas. It is simple and seems to me to truly represent the Sherpa viewpoint. This guy seems to be a true climber and talks like one. A far better book than Jamling's."
2,More offensive than informative,"While the information and comparisons to his father's climb were insightful and interesting, I was put off by the author's comments on Americans and the spirituality of America. This book was more about Buddism and its practice than a climbing adventure. The descriptions of Buddhist customs are informative, but this reader did not appreciate the tone which came across in these sections. As both a Jew and an American, I felt like I was being disrespected when I read it."
3,Jamling Norgay's book on Everest,"I have seen Jamling's public presentations and wonder how he wrote this book. No reviews recognise that Broughton Coburn actually wrote it and that he is an already acclaimed writer and Himalayan expert. It seems to me that this is HIS book - not Jamlings. The thoughts/feelings expressed are obviously not from the mouth of Jamling. Be aware of this when you read this book - this is not a true Sherpa story - this is a western (overspiritualised) version of a Sherpas story. It is good reading but pretty much rehashes what Tenzing Norgay's ""Man of Everest"" and Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air "" did. Not a lot new.Jamling himself does not seem to have a great deal to say personally. I had hoped to hear the real story of the Sherpas."
4,"Great product, but too small!","This is a fabulous product that allows you to not worry about having a blanket handy when there is a breeze or the air conditioning is too cold. The only negative about the Bundle Me product is that it is far too small. We were unable to zip it after my son was two months old. Fortunately, it was summer so we just tucked it around him. It should be redesigned so that infants can use it until they exceed 27 or 28 inches, which is the limit for most infant carriers."
1,This case makes the T9 player un-useable! Garbage !!,I found the samsung T9 to be qa fantastic player and decided I needed a case.This is pretty much the only one made for it so I purchased...I received it today having visions of going to the gym with my new player on my arm...I put the case on the player. It fits the player really tight...TOO TIGHT. It presses in all the buttons on the side together and it makes the player either constantly turn on and off or makes the player unresponsive to all button presses because all the buttons are pressed at once! You also cant cut out the part of the case that fits over the buttons because it holds the case together! What a piece of s*** this is. Does anyone at Belkin test anything before it goes out the door or are they paying 10 year olds 5 cents an hour overseas to make these ? Absolute useless garbage. I intend to return immediately. Get a clue Belkin.
4,"Works as described, but not exceptional","The T9 armband and MP3 player case works as described, I use the case on a regular basis, with my only complaint is that, even with before mentioned modifications to the case, the USB connection does not work well with the player in the case. It is no big deal and now I just remove the player from the case each night while updating and charging. I do like the magnetic clasp and I am able to use all controls w/o any difficulty. I also use a Sennheiser CX300 pair of earbuds with a sideways plug w/o any issues.The arm band does its job and I find it is especially nice when working out in the yard. Overall the quality of both the case and armband seem pretty good, I've only used it for a few weeks, I guess I'll know more about the durability over time.For me, I felt the price is about average for this type of accessory and believe it is worth the cost."
2,Very disappointed...,"I bought this product hoping it would be an excellent addition to my purchase of the Samsung T-9. Boy was I wrong. Let me begin by saying the neoprene armband uses way too much material. I use my T-9 while I am working out, so I need to be able to work out while I am wearing my player. The armband is so bulky I find it very difficult to do this. I have tried positioning it up high or down low on my arm to no avail. I purchased a similar product from Sansa. Their armband uses a cheaper and less bulky set-up but it is less obtrusive and allows you to workout w/the player in any position on your arm. So no, I would not recommmend this product."
3,Armband Size Limitations,"A well made case with a lot of nice features. The problem with the side of the case pushing the buttons disappears after some modest finger stretching of the case side. The connector issue can be overcome as previously suggested, by forcing and turning the connector through the port or removing the T9 for docking.Unfortunately, for anyone with an arm circumference between approximately 11 and 14 inches, this unit may not work at all as an armband. My 13 inch arm completely frustrates the adaptability of the unit. If your arm is not between 11 and 14 inches, you should have no problems - up to about 17.5 inches. I still like the case and the fact that it unclips from the armband allows it to still be useable as a belt clip."
4,Works well for me,"The case works well for me. Unlike the experience reported by another user, the one I have does not push the buttons. In fact, I like the design: it makes it easy to get to all the features and see the screen.I found the armband a bit snug and uncomfortable but that might be personal taste; people who wear armbands more often might find it normal. But nicely, the front part that holds the T9 slips off and can be used separately as a belt clip, which is how I have mostly been using mine."
1,Junk,Couldn't make it work at all. I even set up a test on the bench to no avail. I finally threw it in the trash can where it belongs.
5,Easy to install and works!,I installed this in a 2006 jeep wrangler that I had the worst luck with the plug cigarette lighter variety. It took about half an hour to get in and I am extremely impressed with the sound and usability. Now the jeep is a loud car to begin with so it's not ideal listening for subtle details in music but I just plug in my iPhone flip the switch and I'm good to go. It works! Extremely happy with this product.
2,Not as described,"There were a number of questions asked about which make/model of car this would be used in so that the ""proper"" style would be delivered. This was to fit a 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan but when it arrived the antenna fittings were completely wrong and could not be installed. I had to make a second purchase(not from this supplier) for the proper patch cord. When I asked about the issue I was pretty much blown off."
3,Highly Unimpressed,I thought this would provide better sound than my wireless Bluetooth FM Modulator from Satechi. But it doesn't. I've wasted not just money but also time installing it.
3,Not his best by far,"I do not how any true Michael Penn fan can say that this is his best album. This effort was supposed to be the one that would launch him into the mainstream with its fancy producer and all but it did not. For this reason, this is not his best work. It was trying too hard to breakthrough.Though it is still good, it does not have the replay value as his other works. Furthermore, many of the songs on this album, I did not like, which is rare since every other penn cd I can listen to the whole album through.In my opinion, March and MP4 are his true accolades...and I can say this with confidence because I have been a Penn fan since I was in the 7th grade and March had first been released.I would admonish anyone proclaiming to be a MP fan to carefully consider his other work before rating this one as his very best."
4,Penn's best record,"I have all of Penn's records, including the first two originals (not the combined amalgamated evil) and as a whole, this is most likely his best. There is nothing on here that engenders in me any reason to skip a track. His arrangements are excellent for pop, his voice is beautiful, his harmonies enticing...this is his best record. Best place to start with Michael Penn."
5,His finest hour (or 40 - 50 minutes)!,"By far his most emotionally honest release to date. The album's production value is admittedly not as strong as some of his others, but the sound quality is very good, and the raw edge adds something to the emotional impact of his songs. For me, his best album, and an absolutely essential purchase."
5,An exquisite collection,"This collection of David Bowie's instrumental pieces makes a lot more sense than most such compilations. It's good to have them all on one CD, and the tracks go so well together that you could almost imagine it is a 'proper' album in its own right.While the opening tracks ""A New Career in a New Town"" and ""V-2 Schneider"" are relatively up-tempo, some could be called 'ambient', while others are beyond classification. However you describe them, thay are by turns beautiful, exhilarating, meditative, or even, occasionally, slightly disturbing.""All Saints"" is a great chance to own, in one handy package, a body of work by Bowie (not forgetting his collaborations here with Brian Eno) that has been immensly influential and also helped to expand the boundaries of popular music."
5,Bowie sort of does Eno,"I didn't know what this album was. I just came across it and downloaded as an mp3 album for my Zune player. If you like the early Brian Eno ambient stuff, you should really like this. I always like Bowie's instrumental stuff and I guess this is a collection of those. Its like he went over to Eno's house and played with his toys in an Eno like fashion with a good amount of his own Bowie-ness thrown in for good measure. Since I tend to like sonic sounding stuff, this is like finding a diamond in the dust."
5,Rare Collection,"This is Bowie's only instrumental collection and some may argue that there is a reason. However, most of these cuts are from ""Low"" and ""Heroes"" with a smattering of new material and some old from Philip Glass. Brian Eno was the main collaborator here, which sums it all up.It was written that only 1,000 copies were made, but I find that difficult to believe if it's available here at Amazon. It is neither for the completist or occasional fan.This collection is an oddity that needs careful listening to (best with great headphones). If you're looking for something other than subtlety, you'll not care for this. If you like Eno and layered (if not obtuse) music that's beyond avant-garde, this is a good listen for you."
4,A good compilation,"Until Buddha of Suburbia (am I mispelling that?) is re-released, this is the one place to find some of the tracks from said album. Other highlights include the Scary Monsters outtake, Crystal Japan, and the early Bowie-Eno composition, Abdulmajid (mixed much later).Those tracks alone justify purchasing a comp. that otherwise includes songs available on albums you probably already have."
3,At least it exists...,This album is worth it only to have. It is not memorable.Burn a friend's copy.
1,The worst ever shopping experience !,"Pls dont buy any thing from Amazon again..They may sell u a Tuxedo if u r in a need of UnderWear..They wrongly catagorize the products and fake the customers..They have just one policy ""FAKE IT AND SELL IT""and the worst customer service..Not dynamic at all..It seems u will be getting a response from Robot !"
3,A practical manual on futures & options,"Well, what can I say. Hull's solutions manual is practical but not entirely useful book. I need more professional solved cases, specially of the real life. The exercises are very simple. Any way, it's a good manual for beginners in derivatives instruments."
1,An Embarassment for Electronic Musicians and Fans,This album serves about as good an introduction to techno and electronic music as Vanilla Ice does to rap.
1,ehh wtf is the fuss about?,"I dont see why there are so many good reveiws. I like electronic music, so I borrowed this from a friend and returned it the very next day. I really tried to give them a chance, but it's just not that good."
1,Number one album of all time,I borrowed this album from a friend based on all the good reviews here. And I forced myself to listen to the entire CD.Fuel My Fire is the best track of the album. But even that doesn't have any musical qualities to speak of. Listening to it seems like a chore. This is the number one album of all time on my list of worst albums.This is not music...this is garbage. Don't waste your money...or your mind.
5,The Prodigy's Classic,"Fat of the Land is the best album from eletronic music of all time. Perhaps, it's more than a eletronic music album because Prodigy got a real punk metal style. Smack my bitch up, Breathe, Firestarter, Diesel Power and Mindfields are a wonderful mix of metal, punk, atmospheric music and eletronica together. Prodigy hit the world with Fat of the Land."
5,PLEASING A VASTER CROWD !!!,"The addition of hardcore/thrash metal guitar god Gizz Butt proved the best idea this dance band ever had,creating a dense (dance ?) and heavy music plagued with killer,hypnotic heavy riffs even an old harcore punker like me (43) can relate to.Everything about this record,the drummining,the synth loops,the bass playing,transpires sheer agression giving you the adrenalin rush of your life !!! I can't but help getting up and shake my hips every time I listen to this record,which,by the way,is incredibly well recorded."
4,Excellent Dark Techno....,"However, I sagged the star rating a bit because there a few songs where the singing turns into rapping, and I hate rap. But I really like Techno. The beats and hard hitting and groovy, they force you to get up and move. They are very fast as well. The bass, keys and all that other good stuff is excellent. Well constructed, well placed, dark stuff all around. Great rave techno stuff. The technometal songs are pretty good, considering I am not the biggest metal fan in the world. The singing/chanting/talking is interesting, with a few quests sprinkled here and there. All the songs are pretty good, but the best one's would have to be Smack my B!tch Up, Serial Thrilla and without a doubt, the head-bobing 'Firestarter' - the catchies song here. Prodigy have held up after some great albums, and this is another good album. Must have for all ye techno fans."
2,doesn't age well,when this album came out i listened to it a million times. Recently i listened to it again and discovered how corny the lyrics really are. I also discovered the music itself isnt much better then average-bad. I can't believe i liked this so much when it came out. It isn't very good at all.
3,Most famous album but not the best,"""Fat of the land"" was the album that made Prodigy the most popular dance group of it's time, equal to teen idols Take That. On this album they had changed alot of their previous style. Heavier drums, more guitars, more vocals, a rougher sound in general. Keith Flint become somehow the frontman singing the lyrics on songs like ""Firestarter"" and ""Breathe"" the 2 most famous Prodigy songs you'll find. Liam Howlett was still the mastermind though but the sound had been changed alot. Only songs like ""Narayan"" ""Climatized"" abd ""Mindfields"" reminds me of the old prodigy, they are rather slow instrumentals. ""Smack my B*tch up"" is a decent dance song even if it got a offensive title. ""Serial Thrilla"" ""Diesel power"" ""Fuel my fire"" and ""Funky sh*t"" are just awful. The reason i'll only give 3 is that it's too uneven, a few good songs are not enough for a top album. ""Music for the gilted generation"" is a master piece compared to this."
2,they can do better,"Compared to the Prodigy's first 2 albums, especially ""Music for the Gilted Genration,"" this album is mediocre. Tracks 5 and 10 are not good at all. The rest is alright but it is not something you will want to listen to again and again. Even tracks like Firestarter and Smack... are nothing compared to songs like Voodoo people, Hyperspeed, Poison, etc. from their previous albums. on the plus side, even this mediocre album does show that they have a lot of potential, so I am eagerly awaiting their next CD. Instead of buying this Cd, get Risotto by Fluke or Journey to the Infinite by Juno Reactor. Those albums represent what all techno should be like."
2,Not worth the wait,"Well, with this release, it's become apparent that Liam and co certainly aren't geniuses, instead they've just been fortunate to tap into something at the correct time - ie big-beat-techno-rock. There are so many better electonica albums than this effort, it's kind of sad The Prodge get so much attention. From an excellent start, the album falls away into a rapid succession of ho-hum tracks. Firestarter is brilliant primarily because of the Cockney-vocal - the music itself is quite lame - check out the Empirion remix on the single for a 300% overhaul!! And what the hell was that last track? Ah well, The Prodge certainly deserve acclaim for pushing boundaries, and this album certainly has a distinctive sound quite like nothing before it - it's a worry though that the band at the forefront of crossover-techno-pop-rock have turned out to be Metallica-wannabes."
5,Punk+Techno=Prodigy,These guys put the punk that was missing in techno and the techno that was missing in punk. They are the new Sex Pistols.
5,Upbeat techno with hard rocking beats!,"This album demonstrates the power of rhythms and drum beats. Their lyrics are sparse but very fitting... just enough to allow you to tell how much of the song is left. As a matter of fact, track four is based off of a line from the Beastie Boy's Album Ill Communication. Another side note, for you gamers out there, it is an excellent music CD for Quake and Quake II. The songs fit the general mood of the game, and Track 7 Narayan, plays during the boss levels... a fitting track. When track 2 Breathe plays, your adrenaline starts pumping and you really get a rush. Overall a must buy if you are interested in understanding our current realm of music."
5,It's the best yet,"The Fat of the Land is really great. All you old Prodigy-fans, who think that Liam should still make rave music, don't bother buying this one. Rave is dead and it's never coming back the way it was. All the songs on FOTL are absolutely fabulous. It's a mix of rock, punk, hip-hop, dance and techno. FOTL definetly kicks some serious butt. If you like Prodigy's new stuff buy this now! If you don't like Prodigy's new stuff, then buy it anyway!"
4,Prodigy has a great new cd,"Fat of the Land was the first cd I had bought after i had gotten my cd player. It had the beat and it always makes me tap my feet, but the songs like Narayan is a little boring so I'd still rate it great but not ecellent"
5,Smack My B**** Up,This album pretty much helped redefine REAL techno. I first heard Breathe when it hit the local rock station and LOVED IT!!! Then I heard Smack My B**** Up when I borrowed it from a friend and I told him I had to make a copy of it. I could not stop listening to it for the longest time. Anyone who loves rock and/or techno will absolutely love this album!!!
3,decent effort,"Fat of the Land is a decent album. There are goos songs like firestarter and diesal power. However, the album gets really repetive quickly. After listening to the album a few times, it's very easy to get tired of it."
3,too much pop,"I am a pretty big prodigy fan, but this latest album is too much pop for me to handle. If you want classic prodigy, get the singles from the ""experience"" album, especially ""charly"". I remember reading somewhere that the next prodigy album will be a lot more drum an bass, so I can only pray. If you want my opinion of the best techno, get a cd by orbital, juno reactor, boards of canada, or aphex twin. Good techno sounds better with age (BOC and aphex twin)"
4,Quite Possibly The Soundtrack From Hell,"Yes, this came out almost four years ago, but it's still a frightening album. From start to finish, the beats don't stop, and the band continues to prove how it can take techno music to new heights. The vocals generally don't add much, but the beat--oh my God, the beat. In my mind, tracks 5, 6 and 7 are some of the scariest music ever recorded. If you get into techno, you probably already own this--if you don't, this is an excellent place to start."
4,"good d**dy, but too much hate. The first 2 were better","I love The Prodigy, but with the release of this alblum, its apparent that they have become far too Americanized. Experience and Music for the Jilted generation were far better than this, which seems to target fans of more hate-oriented music such as Nine Inch Nails. CAN'T WE ALL JUST LIVE TOGETHER??!??!??!??"
5,The best of Prodigy.,This is the best music I have ever heard. It has great beat. Nothing could beat it. And this isn't there peak. I can't wait until there next album comes out. I'll tell you this is better than Micheal Jackson at his peak.
3,the crab,"I rated this three, because despite the fact that Breathe is an excellent tune half of the tunes on this album are poor compared to what the Prodigy can accomplish. If you know the prodigy you know that poor songs are still good ones, just good songs are excellent!!!"
1,"Worst of the 90s, the end of culture","When ""Fat of the Land"" came out, I predicted that Prodigy would set an all-time record: In five years, everyone would be embarrassed they even bought the album. Well, it hasn't even been two years, and the prediction is coming true. This isn't music, it's product, and everyone involved, from the artist to the fans, should be well ashamed of themselves. Aren't we, collectively as a society, a lot smarter than falling for all these calculated rock groups?"
1,I wish I could give this album zero stars or less!,"Despite being vulgar and mesogynistic, Prodigy lack musical talent. What else can I say? Do not waste your money!"
1,Highly Inappropriate,"Albums like these make me sick, The lyrics make no sense at all and The Prodigy I have to say are utterly talentless"
5,Classic.,"This CD will make for the trippiest listen of your life. Note that this is not just for techno lovers. Fans of every genre WILL find something they like on this cd. Trust me, by the end of your listen, you WILL be dancing.Normally I can't stick dance music, but I have fallen in love with this CD."
3,it's alright...,"I am a big Prodigy fan. I love their first two albums, ""Experience"" and ""Music For The Jilted Generation,"" but this album is their worst. It is block-rockin', you got that right, but it is missing substance and some tracks are too hip-hopy for me (""Diesel Power,"" etc.). I suggest if you are a new Prodigy fan to go with ""Music For The Jilted Generation,"" as it is the best."
4,Firestarter,"may i point out two things...actually three...1. firestarter is very catchythat is if you're into this kind of music.2.it was also used in Charlie's angels full throttle...but it was not on the soundtrack...bummer...and #3 this particular song (if you wanted to know) was the main tune used in Wipeout XL for Paystation and nintendo 64. and to close on a final note, i have yet to hear the rest of the album...but i tink it is absolutely 4 star material."
1,utter crap,"Since when is ""infiltrating pop"" music a good thing for an electronic band to do? i'd rather reminisce prodigy's first album where it was just liam howlett and a bunch of dancers smokin' joints than listen to fat of the land's wave after wave of liquid fecal matter"
2,"Not so bad, but...","This Cd has two or three great songs, but it isn't really good (I am not a friend of electronic music). Only for Profigy 's fans."
5,This CD Kicks [butt],"It's ashame that Prodigy hasn't come out with anything that can equal this titanic, energized cd. I mean just listen to Breathe or Serial Thrilla, or even Disel Power! You are blown away by the raw base and hype cords. If you haven't heard Prodigy yet, you definitely want to pick up this cd! I am listening to it right now!"
4,"Their peak, and that's saying something.","Their previous album ""Music For The Jilted Generation"" is incredible. I didn't think it could be topped. ""Fat Of The Land"" does it, barely. It's an excellent mesh of electronica, metal and pop, that's just heavy enough to sound almost industrial on some tracks. This had three huge singles from it, but could have had three more I'd say. ""Smack My Bitch Up"", ""Breathe"" and ""Firestarter"" still sound impressive even in 2011. They all made the Singles collection and rightly so, but the remaining tracks alone make this disc essential. Not many albums in any genre are solid front to back. This is, and it somehow gets better as the years pass."
4,What can you expect from The Prodigy?,"Good songs! In my opinion, this album and ""Invaders must die"" are the best from The Prodigy so far.If you like The Prodigy, this is a must in your collection!"
5,"Once you start listening to it, you don't want to stop","I listen to different bands in spurts - & Prodigy is one where once I pull the CD out & listen to it once, I'm stuck on it for months. This is such an excellent CD that I can listen to it @ least twice a day for months before I finally get tired of it. I've had it for over a year now & I'm still listening to it @ least once a day. It's great music that keeps you moving - no matter where you are, @ work or in your car."
3,"Original, if one dimensional","The Prodigy's sound evloved in this album from previous efforts. This was the first of their albums to receive sustained critical acclamation. The music- or should that be, sound- is occasionally thrilling, as on Firestarter, Breathe and Serial thrilla. But other efforts such as Diesel power and smack my bitch up now sound dated and are rather one dimensional in their construction and lyrical message. Granted, this is an album intended for the dancefloor, but it contains tracks which transcend the dance genre and still provoke interest. As an album, The Fat of the Land is of mixed quality, however and there are tracks on there I won't listen to again."
4,good stuff,"I like this CD for two main reasons. ""Breathe""and ""Firestarter."" I'm always looking for a CD with heavy bass so I can beat the rap-fans when they play rap in their cars. When I crank up Breathe or Firestarter you can hear me a mile away! Rap-fans watch out!"
3,I like Prodigy but this is by far the worst album,"Fat Of The Land is good. But not great. And darned if it ain't trendy people. To anyone who bought this Cd and thought it was cool, or to anyone who bought this Cd and hated it, try the 2nd Prodigy Album, ""Music For The Jilted Generation"", it will blow your mind."
1,Too old to be useful,This set of books dates from 1983. It is so out of date that it is practically useless. Your money would be better spent contacting the publisher and ordering the newest set.
5,Like he said,"I would just like to echo what Mr. R. D. Murphy wrote in his review. I too have studied Qabalah (or ""Kabbalah"" as the author spells it) for quite awhile now and have gained much deeper insights into it thanks to the Qabalistic rendition given in this book. Very insightful indeed! I have also been using the system of the Cycles for about 5 months now, and have no quibbles with it. As far as I can tell, it is very accurate and has helped me in some important matters in my life. Because of this and the author's free cycles calculator that is on his website, I give it five stars. There is a lot out there today that talks a good talk but never delivers what all that talk is about. This book does and I intend to continue using it."
1,Did NOT work for me!,"I'm sorry to say that this didn't work for me. I read the book thoroughly, downloaded the sunrise and sunset times as indicated and proceeded with the mathematics which is instructive in working out the hours the system is based on. I synchronised my watch to the exact time so that there could be no mistake. I chose an hour and a day that were supposedly extremely favourable to the outcome I wanted. Guess what!? It didn't work. For all the hyperbole and example after useless padded out example that this book provides, the system is little better than basically relying on chance. The author has no website and has no contact details so one cannot even question him about the things he states in the book. So, in a nutshell, the 'system' DOES NOT WORK and the book is extremely incorrent with lots of verbiage and repetition. Shakespeare this book is NOT!"
1,Throwing all my Lisiewski books in the trash,"I own 2 other books by this author, both of which I feel had some value, if the bombastic, hypocritical attitude he takes towards his New Age bogeyman does wear thin fast.Nonetheless, after the utterly shameless promotional attempts made here by all of the fake ""reviewers"", not only will I be getting rid of the 2 of his books I already own, but I'll be looking over again with a critical eye my entire NF collection.Sure, some of the positive reviews seem legit, but when so many are posted by people who have reviewed no other books, and when any critical comment gets ""dugg"" down, something just smells fishy.Ironically it's exactly the kind of trick you would expect from the New Age shucksters Lisiewski so clearly wants to distinguish himself from.Caveat emptor."
2,"Sounds neat, but doesn't work!","Joseph Lisiewski has made it his personal mission to make life seem so very straightforward and easy. This book does contain some decent information on basic Kabbalah, though he uses the somewhat flawed Western Tree rather than the 13th century Hebrew Tree which is symbolically and magically much more coherent. In the midst of lengthy and authoritative-sounding dogmatizing, Lisiewski presents a system of self-mastery and personal empowerment that flies one skyward to the heights of self-confidence and then!... doesn't work. At all. I lived this system for about six months because I didn't want to throw it out without having given it a fair shake. Fair shake given, it's little more than a money trap. Buy it if you hate that heavy feeling you get in your wallet."
4,John Rocks!,"I am an old-school Petra fan and I must say that I was nervous when I heard that this album existed. (I didn't want the band to break up!) But this album is AWESOME! John Schlitt just wanted to break out and do something different, which is just what he has accomplished with this album. I must say, this album is better than *anything* that Petra has put out in a decade. It has the driving rock sound that Petra has somehow lost as they try to turn *mainstream* with their new alternative sound.Go for it, John! This is what Petra fans want!!! (When is the next one coming out?) :-)"
4,good set,this Disc combines AD's first two Album's&Speech's Solo Album.there first Album unto itself was a Greatest Hits Package.alot of Cool Songs that fit really well on that Album.but sadly they never recovered on any follow up&neither did Speech as a Solo Artist but I heard they are getting back together time will tell if they can even half-way Recapture there early Magic?
5,CD was good,"The cd was awesome, I gave it a five because it was what I expected. I barely knew the group until a friend played it for me. I heard at least one or two songs on it, and I knew I had to have it."
4,"Clear, Concise, Graphically accurate, and user-friendly.","We borrowed this book from a friend and used it on our trip with great success. The unique graphics (Aerial Photos and simplified rock face topos) make deciphering approaches easy and route finding pretty simple. The star ratings were dead on and we enjoyed the climbs immensely. I was able to hand the book to a novice and ask them to tell me where we needed to go, what we needed to take, and they were quickly able to answer. All bolt counts for our routes were spot on as well."
3,Damaged product,"No problems with Rochas as I have not been able to even use it. When I received the package the cap was broken and when i tried to return it the next day i found out you can't because it's considered hazardous waste or something like that. Anyway, just be aware that you may get damaged products from Amazon."
1,"Great Cologne, Poor Shipping","Rochas Man is amazing cologne: Sweet, sexy + unique. I've bought it many times + received tons of compliments from random strangers. But, my big issues with this seller is that I ordered my cologne 19 days ago + I've STILL not received it yet + according to Amazon's delivery estimate, it should have arrived almost 10 days ago. Considering I had no choice but to pay seven dollars in shipping + handling, I'm still trying to figure out what exactly I paid for, because it was definitely not for standard mail rates. So, in review: AMAZING COLOGNE, LAME SELLER"
1,SMELLS LIKE GIRLS PERFUME - TOO SWEET (COTTON CANDY),"This is a sweet smelling cologne. It reminds me of the Britney Spears ""Fantasy"" perfume. Rochas man would be comparable to cotton candy. It's a bit OVERWHELMING at first, and the scent does change a bit, according to your pH balance. It smells different on different people after a while. I don't think this belongs in the men's section, and that's because I like sweet colognes, but not THIS sweet. I mean look at it, it comes in a pink box, and looks like a girls perfume."
2,WAY TOO SWEET!!,It didn't work with my body chemistry and it smells way too sweet on me. It reminds of cotton candy. Smells like JOOP! Not for me.
5,Fantastic!,"This album is so fantastic! Especially the first three songs! I heard no. 1, ""Not an Addict"" and i fell in love with it. It was my soul reason for buyin the CD, but the other songs were great aswell! I think you should buy this album!"
5,One of the greatest vocal sounds ever put down.,I saw them in concert on a Friday night and they totally shocked me at how good they were. The next day I bought the cd and it is one of the better sounding groups i have heard in awhile. Sarah Bettens has such a terrific voice. A definite buy.
4,very good album,"I was always a fan of ""not an addict"" but never had this album. This is a great album, Sarah Bettens has an amazing voice. I was little disappointed in the condition it arrived (the jewel case had some minor damage) but i thought it would be a hassle to return it. Other then that the cd was fine and Im glad i bought it."
4,It's a very good album but...,"Comparing with the last ""Cocoon crash""... This is more ""heavy"" , Cocoon crash is more pop. You can find a kind of punk song ""Old woman"" that's one of my favourites. ""Not an addict"" (the first one) it's the most known song and very good too. Although for me the best songs of this cd are ""Mr Freeze"", ""Paradise in me"" the heaviest one, ""Iron flower"" and the last one ""Something's wrong"" (recorded alive, very funny). All of them sung by the warm voice of Sarah. A great cd."
2,I'm not addicted to this,"If you love ""Not and Addict"" that doesn't mean you'll like this. This CD is filled with bland songs that are totally devoid of melody. The production is pretty good, but at some point a band just needs good material and K's choice doesn't have it."
1,First Kiss,"Being photographed in what appears to be but is not a compromising position with a married man makes Kiki Sonntag a pariah. Within a day's time, she's dropped from her publicist's list of clients and so harrassed that she is forced to check into a hotel called the Affair under an assumed name, Jennifer Anniston. Immediately, she runs into the hotel's owner, Fab Tomba, a playboy who pushes all her buttons. Sparring sessions turn into something more, but things like cell phones, kid sisters, and life in general continually get between them and passion. When not trying to figure out how to get together with Fab, Kiki worries about how to get her life back on track and rescue her friends from themselves.* The book as well as its heroine are shallow and, at times, a bit crass. While it may get points for clever product placement and a potentially good idea for the plot, it comes off as completely tawdry. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
1,Don't Bother,"If you started ""The Bridesmaid Chronicles"" with the Karen Kendall books and expect this one to stay true to the quality and spirit--not to mention the PLOT--of them, you're in for a disappointment. This book has almost nothing to do with the actual series. It's barely even a romance; more ""chick-lit"" than anything. As most of the other reviewers have noted, Kiki, the main character, is unbelievably shallow and she doesn't ever improve. It's like spending a few hours in Paris Hilton's head. As for the hero, you never get any real sense of him at all. Basically, he comes across as a guy with a stupid name--Fab Tomba--who's only appeal, other than being ""hot"" is he listens to Kiki blather on about incredibly inane stuff and somehow manages to be charmed by her.This is the first book I've read by this author and I won't be seeking her out for a follow up."
2,Dissapointing and disconnected,"I really liked the tone and attitude of the Bridesmaid Chronicles. But this book just doesn't fit, and Kiki is anything but a heroine. I couldn't identify with her at all, and in fact was constantly waiting for the moment when somebody would teach her a real lesson about her interferring ways. But no one ever does, even ""Fab"" (whose name bothered me immensly) ends up chuckling and going ""Oh, Kiki..."" instead of telling her to stick her nose elsewhere.The other books in this series are fantastic, and you don't need to read this one completly to understand those, so I suggest reading a plot summary and skipping it. Unless you want to laugh at an unsympathetic character."
3,It was ok,"I really kept waiting for Kiki to do an about face on her shallowness but she didn't. Otherwise, I did read through this book quickly just to see what would happen. I was disappointed with the lack of interaction between Kiki and the other bridesmaids.I have read the 1st 3 of this series so far and the first (""First Date"") has been the best. I really felt like I got to know those characters. ""First Dance"" would get my vote for the 2nd best.I would have read this book regardless of the reviews just because I wanted to read the whole series. It was a fine book. A quick beach read. Nothing you have to think much about. I wouldn't skip over it but I wouldn't expect it to be fantastic."
1,piece of junk,bought this item.... played two movies and the screen went out. what a disappointment! will not buy Audiovox again!
1,Failed when called upon,"Uplugged the battery from the charger, packed in the carry on, went to use in in the 3rd hour of 6 hour flight to entertain my 3 year old girl, DVD loaded, hit the power switch, nothing happened, doublechecked everthing, but had to explain to a 3 year old why she couldn't see Pocahontas because the new DVD player was broke. (still works with AC though)"
4,This one works,"I received this unit as a replacement for a D1830 which I received that did not work. The replacement D1830 works great plays just about every type of dvd or cd. The screen is very good as well as the ease of use.The speakers wihout headphones are not that good, however for a portable dvd unit it may be as good as you could expect. It does not have as fastforward or rewind, which makes it unhandy when you switch off the unit. It has all the necessary accesories which make it handy for all types of veiwing. I recommend the Audivox D1830."
5,jarrow formula opc 95 100 grape seed extract,This is a great product. My cardiologist recommends this supplement. The value is good and Jarrow is a reputable label.
3,Best for very delicate metals,Works great if using to bend very soft or fine gauge metals and you do not want to scratch the finish. I am using it for wire sculpting and 12g coated soft steel wire is my medium. The soft foam gives too much for wire that stiff so it makes it more difficult to bend. It works good with aluminum and other fine wire that I use. I do not see the foam holding up for very long though being as soft as it is.
2,Pliers,These pliers did not hold up to my expectations. The nylon tips spin around and after only three uses the nylon has split and the tips have come off. They do however have a strong grip but the reason for which I purchased the product to protect my wire failed.
5,Perfect!!,"They work perfect for fixing my wire just right and not ruining it. Also, instead of using my hands to straighten wire I can use my nylon pliers and it works like a charm."
1,Poor Product,I bought this spreader last fall and have used it twice. The control lever broke the first time I used it so I contacted the company who promptly sent me a replacement. I used it again and the lever broke again. I would not recommend buying this product. Spend the extra money and buy a Scott's brand.
1,not too pleased,This just came and it is pretty much all plastic. The instructions are not complete or easy. Not sure I will even bother trying to figure it out.
5,The best c.d. I own,"You definitely have to be a lover of music to enjoy this album. If you are, it is the sweetest, softest, coolest album you will ever listen to. I had never heard of these guys until recommended from a friend. It is for sure the coolest c.d. I own. It's on the mellow side, but sooooo enjoyable. My taste for music varies from one end of the spectrum to the other end. This album sits perfectly right in the middle. Own it."
2,Bland Is the New Spicy,"Or whatever the vigorous opposite of 'bland' is. I've tried listening to this but it's not possible to take more than 1 tracks at a sitting. I just marvel at such obvious talent and sincerity ending up as such a non-event. I guess those scandiwegian nights are long n chilly and there's not much else to do but wear the tread off yr fave 'Chad n Garfunkel sing the Best of Nina and Drake' CDs, hone yr guitar technique ... and buff up the old English. When daylight returns - voilà! - you're both *technically* too good to ignore. They're clearly hells nice blokes in an endearingly fey n whimsical way and what I can make out of the chick looks cute in a bjrkish way. I play this album with the port and cheese and make everyone ""Spot the Influence"". Hey - astute reviews by everyone - *including* the usually abrasive Amazon critic. I guess the homey album photo precludes reaching for the usual bovver boots. Bless 'em, I say - and it sounds like a nice project to have put together."
5,The sound of silence,"Imagine Norway. A distant fjord. The blue water. The chilling wind. You see a wooden cabin. You open the door and it's not a Sauna.... It's a wonderful CD playing in ""repeat"". Kings of convenience look so young you wonder how come they already make such great music? Where at all did they hear of Simon and Garfunkel, The Everly Brothers and Nick Drake. And who taught them to mix it all into something so fresh. Well, maybe there is something in those pickled Herring. It's not dead fish. It's magic."
5,"Beautiful melodies, beautiful lyrics","This album is one the best albums I own, (second only to Boy With the Arab Strap by Belle and Sebastian), and I think more people need to hear it. The music is reminiscent of late '60s, early '70s bands like Simon and Garfunkel, Nick Drake and Love. Their lyrics range from the simplistic, (The Girl From Back Then), to the metaphorical, (Parallel Lines).The singing is soft and intimate and the guitar work is precise, meticulous and always excellent. If you listen carefully to some of the songs, a downtuned acoustic guitar provides the bass line.""Quiet is the New Loud"" is a gorgeous, sparse and extremely beautiful album and is an essential addition to any folkie's record collection."
4,"Pleasantly funny,","I recently purchased/watched this movie,I actually really liked it alot. The picture quality of my dvd was good and clear. For this movie to be low budget,I thought it was very funny/tastefully done. It's nice to get an uncensored male prospective(s) on love,sex and relationships. I recommend that people purchase this movie, especially if you're looking for some good laughs !"
5,Saved my life,"So I titled my review....'Saved my life' because I surreptitiously picked up this book when I had almost a whole day to kill while I was staying at a hostel in Levanto, Italy. It was one of the only books there that was written in English and not Italian.I'm not a fast or well versed reader by any means. But I loved this book. I continued to read it for weeks afterwards and I enjoyed it immensely. I would even go so far as to say that it could be in my top 5 favorite books. I really did feel like it saved me because of the subject - the priest during WWII - and the complete happiness I received while reading it. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
2,Ralphie May,"I like Ralphie May , but I don't think this was one of his best, I have seen much better then this..I was not too happy with this"
4,Good Experience,"No problems in the ordering process, DVD arrived within given time period. Pleasant experience overall, would order again without hesitation."
4,If you're easily offended ...,"2011NR: Rock it Ralphie. ""White, black, and brown against a new kind of brown"". If you're easily offended, watch the big man anyway. We could all use a little offending in our perpetually apologetic, ""everyone is special"", oversensitive culture. One of the best (smartest) comedians I've see in the vein of Carlin & Rock. MFJLabs 4x"
2,Disappointing,"Ralphie is a funny man, and an intelligent speaker, but seems to have his priorities confused in this DVD. People go to a stand-up show, or buy a comedy DVD to laugh, not get self help or a motivational speech. The middle 50% of this DVD would have gone over GREAT at a college orientation. It was honest, insightful, and all-round good advice. It did not belong in a comedy routine though, and seriously killed the tempo of the show. You could have heard a pin drop in my living room for a solid 30 minutes there."
3,mediocre and not that informative,"Obviously she hates Barbara... What other truly juicy news is there except that about his ignoring his family, cheating on his wife and drinking too much ??? Not much. I'd rather read Kitty Kelley's book --"
1,SPOILED SINATRA BRAT LOOKING FOR DOUGH!,"Well, the finest exponent of the American Popular Song has been gone for 2 years now and I am frankly surprised it has taken this long for one of his money and attention hungry children to publish a mud slinger! At least Tina has the good common sense NOT to sling the mud Daddy's way! (I suspect THAT one will come from Junior!) I sat and read this one in a few hours @ the bookstore. Do the same if you MUST, just don't send a damn dime her way!"
4,A real page turner...,"Not a big fan of Sinatra's, however this book was highly recommended so went online and rolled the die. VERY impressed. A big fan of biographies in general, however I've certainly plowed through my share of mind-numbing tributes with clear issues of partiality. Was a bit wary with Tina (daughter) doing the narrative, however was favorably impressed. She's clearly a ""daddy's girl"", yet at the same time gave a brutally honest depiction of her father and his relationships. Wish she would've devoted a few more pages on his fall-out with the Kennedy's, however. Overall one of the best books I've read in quite a few years. I'm a fan."
5,An Excellent Book,"I have been exposed to Frank Sinatra's music all my life, and been a fan of his since I was 9. However, after reading this book, I feel I know him in a way like never before, in a more detailed, intimate way. I truly understand the kind of man and person he was. Tina does an outstanding and thorough job explaining the man her father was, from all points. She describes what he was like as a father, husband, friend, performer, etc. She leaves nothing out, nor does she sugar-coat the story. She tells the truth, in an honest, loving, respectful way. I am proud to say I own this book, and have enjoyed it very much. It's a must for all fellow Sinatra fans. My hats off to her- great job, Tina!"
4,You can feel the love...,"The end of this book left me bawling my eyes out. You can just FEEL the love Tina had for her father. Very well written!! I believe I wouldn't elaborated as much about Barbara, however. After all, it was his wife and maybe he loved her? But I certainly can understand how Tina felt. It's tough to lose your Dad...believe me, I know. I lost my Dad in 1991 so I can certainly relate. I highly recommend this book to any Sinatra fan. He was the GREATEST!! There will never be anyone to compare with him. He did it 'his way' and I've always admired him for that."
4,I believed every word of it!,"I have been a cop in Houston Texas for 15 yrs, so I am pretty seasoned when it comes to hearing stories that are embellished or just plain out false. I could not put this book down. I felt like I was sitting down at a kitchen table with this woman as she poured out her heart. So much of what she said I understood, because I too have a stepmother that used her cunning and ingenious mind to divide my family and drive a wedge between me and the father I adored. When she spoke of not seeing any photos of her or her siblings, I nearly fell out of my chair! I had felt those same things but never acknowleged them. I felt Tina's pain when she spoke of her love and devotion to her father. I pray it brought her the healing she needed. And as for Barbara Sinatra, shame on her. She is why step-mothers have such bad reputations. Don't worry Tina, her day will come."
4,A review of the very good(and bad) years,"I picked this book up a week ago, and really enjoyed reading it. While it doesn't give the reader a good idea of his childhood or pre 1950's career(that's the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars), it is a great portrayal of Frank Sinatra as a father, a husband and a friend. It's sad t read how full of life and vigor he was up until the last 20 years of his life. By the 1980's, his wife and her cronies had him him doped up, and made him flying around the world like a dancing bear for far too many years(You must take the last 150 pages with a grain of salt. Frank's daughter is the author of this book, and she was never a fan of her father's fourth and final wife). If you want to learn about swinging singer, read something else. However, if you want to learn about the person behind all the glitz, read this."
1,Really!,Sorry but this book sounds like a jealous daughter who wanted her father back with her mother . You can't tell me Frank Sinatra could not get rid of this woman if he wanted to. He had the best lawyers money could afford for that matter he could have walked away like he did with his other wifes. The part that caught my attention was when she said you had to earn being a Sinatra you couldn't adopt one . Sorry but I haven't seen any of his children do anything to earn the name of Sinatra it was just an accident of birth for them. This was a Barbara bashing book instead of loving memories I thought it would be.
4,My Father's Daughter,"An interesting book. She doesn't have much nice to say about Barbara Sinatra, but she does reveal a lot about how Frank Sinatra always took care of his family and friends."
4,You're Let in on Family Secrets,"For true Sinatra fans, this book offers probably the best report on the final months of the Chairman from an inside perspective. It's not altogether a pretty picture. In fact, it's sad to read of Sinatra's depression pills, loss of hearing, cancer, and heart attacks, all amidst a family fight to gain control of financial assets. FS stumbled on stage and off, threatening his own legacy of image and performance. Daughter Tina makes no bones about detesting the ""wicked stepmother"" in this saga. This is a pretty good book, especially for Sinatra fans who can use it to fill in missing holes in the Sinatra story. For those of us who have read a lot about FS, there's no apparent reason not to believe most of this account. It's an easy read, too."
3,my father's daughter,"If tina wrote this book as part of her healng process, so be it. There has never been another singer like FS and I just love him no matter what negative books are written about him"
2,something for reflection,This is an interesting yet tragically true story of a disfunctional family's inability to relate to each other. None of them ever succeed receiving the love they need from one another. A famously familiar family whose story is worth reflecting on.
5,Very Solid,i couldn't wait to get this Book after i saw Tina Sinatra on 60 minutes.this book is very detailed&full of insight into Frank Sinatra the Man on&off the stage.alot of eye opening material.i have read alot of books on Old Blue Eye's but Family knows best.Tina Sinatra gives up the goods here.a must read.
4,A LOW BLOW,"This book is a good read. I came away feeling so sorry for Mrs. Sinatra. If you read between the lines you see that she was married to FS for over 20 years, and had his children biting at her heels the whole time. I am sure FS would not appreciate what his daughter revealed so callously. She came away with nothing of her father's but his robe? I have a bridge to sell you! I agree with two other reviews here! Tina, get a life, a job & some respect for your family. I would not have bought it had I known."
3,Interesting look behind the myth of Ol' Blue Eyes,"No doubt about it, Tina Sinatra doesn't hold back any punches in this memoir of her father. Definitely some interesting behind the scenes looks at Frank Sinatra and well worth reading. However, one gets the idea that this is a 300 page editorial against Barbara Sinatra. Often it is difficult to tell what is pure fact and what is written out of pure anger and revenge."
3,From the heart,"A sincere, thoughtful story of a daughter's love for her father. I think anyone who has a strong relationship with a parent can relate to this book. Contrary to some ...., I don't think Tina Sinatra needs either the money or attention. I think she just felt it was important that readers gain new insight into her father's life."
3,EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT!,"This book almost has a ""town-cryer"" effect in its tell all format, yet it is touching to read about a father as seen through the eyes of his youngest child. It reveals the snappy snazzy Frank Sinatra, the crooner we are all familiar with, and the ""other Frank""- a loving father, soft, sensitive, vulnerable. He lived his life, his way- and his daughter now tells us all about it-- her way.The portion about Frank's last wife is caustic and sharp. The other ladies in his life receive kinder coverage. The book is well- written and should hold the interest of any reader. It is a compelling look at this famous entertainer and his family."
4,A must read for any sinatra fan,"I read this book after reading Lady Blue Eyes, by Barbara Sinatra. I had many questions after reading Barbara's book but Tina set me straight."
3,Thoughts On the Book,"Gale Christianson's biography on Edwin Hubble is the story of possibly the greatest astronomer of our time. The book includes interesting nuances about Hubble's life as well as all of his discoveries in his work. It was obvious that the author had a great amount of respect for Hubble's discoveries as well as a lot of fascination over his life. The book is extremely informative, sharing all of the details of Hubble's life as well as those of the people important to Hubble. The book is quite recommendable both as a biography, and also as an astronomy book. It teaches a significant amount on the basic terms and ideas of astronomy as well as touching on some of the more advanced concepts. The book is a wonderful account of the life of a great astronomer and the history of astronomy."
5,"Beauty, brains, personality, and a great voice","I had the pleasure of meeting Libby this week on Amelia Island, FL. What a WONDERFUL woman. We chatted a lot about music. I had no idea how good she really was until I checked her songs out on the internet. And I must say that she is a HIT ! Cute and sincere vocals. Strong melodic songwriting. Highly recommended. Now, let's see, how do I go about getting a Libby Floyd screensaver that plays her songs while I'm surfing the web? hmmmm."
4,A Real Classic RTS,"Although this game is very old, it is the best Westwood game ever made! It's fun to play online and fun to play newbies and advanced people alike. The gameplay is far better than Tiberian Sun and Starcraft and has pretty good music for an old comp game. You can play me on WW Online, my nick is SSJ4G0KU"
5,Great Book,This textbook is the only reason I passed my Computer Organization class. The chapters can be read out of order or just for reference as I have been doing recently while taking a Computer Architecture class.I highly recommend this book to anyone in Computer Engineering
3,"Good information, poor organization","Book had all the information you would need in the subject, but it was poorly organized and had many errors"
3,Review,Questions at the end of chapter are hard to understand sometimes. Wording is a bit confusing.
5,"Good Reference, Easy Reading","I like the layout of the book, it works great as a reference, but since I am just beginning my education of computer architecture, I'm actually just reading through it.The first chapter is bland, covering basic computer knowledge topics, such as how mice work. After that, the book's depth increases dramatically. It give through explanations of compilers and assemblers with ample examples in C and assembly language. There are hints of Java-based examples, but I haven't read far enough to find them yet.In lab the MIP instruction reference was very handy."
4,Pretty good.,"This was used for my computer architecture class. Some topics are complicated no matter how you slice it, but the book does a good job at being detailed enough so that the reader understands the concept. Some other topics could be better. But then again, the book would be huge."
5,"Simple, clear introduction","For anyone who wants to know how simple processing and memory works. IO devices chapter was so thin as to be useless, but the main parts of the book were comprehensive.Used as a textbook in class, but I will keep it as a reference due to high quality and readability."
4,older version is better,well organize content. however some materials had moved to the CD ROM which is not convenience for study.recommend getting the older version if possible.
3,Remaster does not stand up to the others,"Although a great CD from a great band, this remaster does not stand up from a sound quality aspect compared to the others I have recently listened to. Example, Force it, Phenomenon, and Lights Out sound great - this one does not have anywhere near the punch and clarity. I'd buy the others and avoid this one until a better version is available."
5,Great tank top,The package arrived promptly. The fabric is very comfortable and light. Deep arm cut allows for extra freedom during workout. Love it.
1,/Poor Quality,"When the product came it was a few days until I opened the package. When I opened the bottle, there was literally no scent. I had already thrown out the packing slip and did not bother with a return. I have used the product many times over the years, but will not order it again. I presumed it had been on the shelf far to long.Thank you"
2,Not what it use to be!,"I have used Royall Lyme for many years, and my most recent bottle left me with deep disappointment. The product is almost all water. I will need to find a new after shave."
5,One of a kind fragrance,"I rarely write reviews of products I've purchased on Amazon. But the Royall Lyme cologne is so special I made an exception. I cannot use colognes or aftershaves with a perfume fragrance due to my severe allergies to all perfumes. But Royall Lyme has such a wonderful,genuine lime smell that it does not bother me at all. And the pure lime smell it has really cannot be described accurately in words,you have to experience it. But be warned,it has a significant alcohol content and stings a little if you use it right after shaving. In my opinion,this item is absolutely unique and superb.Really worth the rather steep price tag. Please try it."
2,Messed up order,"I ordered this item as a gift, checked the ""GIFT"" option, and included a free greeting card.When the order arrived, there was no gift card, and the receipt was included with the price shown... So much for the gift!"
1,Smells like DEET,This cannot be the after shave everyone is talking about. After buying it I threw it away! It's that bad! I returned to check tthe dates of the good reviews and they are pretty old. The formula can not be the same stay away. I can not recommend Royal Lyme period.
2,Surprised!,"Given the overwhelmingly postive reviews for this product, I was very surprised when I opened the bottle and smelled the scent. It was, well... not very pleasant might be a nice way of saying it. When I put a bit on and had my wife and kids smell it (thinking that perhaps it was my uneducated sniffer) they confirmed that it was not a pleasant smell at all... it was almost as if the product had gone bad, if indeed aftershave can go bad. Setting aside the aroma which to my taste was not at all appealing, the bottle was fantastic and the clever sealed paper packaging was great! I have tried a few other bay rums (my wife is pushing me to get a scent) and all have been pretty pleasant but this particular product did not come close, unless the bottle is more important to you than the scent inside, I would probably try another brand or perhaps try the company's sampler set which provides the buyer with more options!"
3,A little disappointed,"It is not like me to write a rather negative review, but I was a bit disappointed with my recent purchase of Royall Lyme, a product that I have been using for over 40 years. This time - it takes me awhile to go through the last bottle - when I re-ordered, I noticed that the product is now manufactured under franchise to some company in the 'States, rather than in Bermuda. And there is quality difference. The new USA-made lotion is thinner in scent, watery and less , oh, zesty than the Bermuda-made original.Did I purchase the wrong product? I mean, its more like the old Old Spice Lime after shave, the star of the local drug store after shaves than the original quality Royall Lyme.Not bad - I'll continue to use it - but a bit disappointing. So, its only 3 stars from me."
4,about royall lyme after shave and cologne,"when i opened the bottle,Royall Bayrhum Of Bermuda By Royall Fragrances For Men. All Purpose Lotion 8.0 Oz.it didn't smell as great until i splashed it on my palm and put it on my skin.it smelled real good.i like it as much as other designer brands.i think its a good buy for the buck."
5,Royall Lyme ... since 1963,I was introduced to Royall Lyme in 1964 when I visited Bermuda with the U.S. Navy. It's refreshing to the skin and has a unique scent of lime. A truly outstanding after shave cologne. I was delighted to locate it from Amazon.
1,Royall Scam !!!,Thanks to the other reviewers who confirmed my worst fear that this once great formula has been compromised and cheapened. I have used the Royall Lyme and Royall Bhay Rum for over 20 years.It was the finest aftershave available. Recent shipments are not from Bermuda And a mere watered down shadow of there former selves. What a let down! Please fire the imbecile who ruined this formerly great product. Bring the original quality formulas back. Until then find something else to use.
2,Made under license in USA <> Made in Bermuda,"It is with sad regret that I must post this ""I don't like it"" review of Royall Lyme.I've been wearing Royall Lyme, Bay Rhum, and Spyce for over 20 years but over the past few years I noticed that quality was ... lacking. When I began to notice the ""Made under license in USA"" on the labels, I could tell that something had changed ... unfortunately for the worse.What used to be an invigorating & refreshing cologne has now been reduced to the fragrance of isopropyl alcohol and lime juice. It's time to revoke the license - it's only damaging the reputation that Royall Lyme had worked so hard to achieve.I can only hope that the owners of Royall Lyme will cancel the US manufacturing licenses and return production back to Bermuda."
2,A cheap perfume poured in a 7-UP bottle,This product has so many raving reviews that i ordered it.This may be appealing to a particular taste but it is very different from contemporarydescent aftershaves.It was returned because my female coworkers were offended by the smell of lime.So please dont use it on Date.
5,Royall Lyme,Excellent value for the money. Product was received in fine condition and smells very good.
1,Junk,this thing is a piece of junk in a waste of money. Don't waste your time.I was expecting it to behave more along the lines of hallmark but no.
5,Cute accessories,"I bought a set of these mod flowers on sale from Amazon for my daughter's room. After I got them, I liked them so much I bought another set. They are bigger than what you would think and are super cute. They come with little ribbons to hang from on the wall, but since I don't want to see the nails, I am going to come up with another way to put them up so they look like they just pop out of the wall. Super cute addition to the whole Mod Flowers decorating set."
4,Great replacements,"These are 2 1/8"" x 1 3/4"" (unstretched) oval pads. With a little effort they fit my 2 3/8"" x 2"" oval Phillips headphones nicely. They are thinner than the original pads. As the package contained four replacement pads, I wound up using all four, putting a pad over a pad. The second pad actually went on even easier as it would not spring back when stretched because it adhered to the pad below. These pads were very inexpensive and I do not consider it wasteful to have used all four. They have brought new life into my favorite headphones which are now more comfortable than when they were new. Recommended."
4,Headphone Pads,"I gave this item 4 stars, not 5, for the following reasons. It was a perfect fit for my Lab Tech headphones, except that I felt the foam material was a bit thin and would wear out sooner. I don't know this for a fact, but time will tell. Other than that I am happy with the pads. I would recommend them to other Lab Tech users."
4,Fits my Labtec headset with mic fine,"It would be nice if the cushions Labtec made were better and lasted longer. Seem to only last a few years - but this is a GENUINE Labtec product - such as it is. Since it is genuine, and cheap, I give it a 4. As far as I know it is the only thing that you can replace them with."
5,Great Headphone covers,Exactly as advertised. Fit perfectly. Nicely made. Replaced badly torn older covers that had been around for about five years.
3,Those are pads. They go on your headphones.,"There really isn't much that I can say about them -- I happen to have Labtec headphones, and the pads on them aren't supposed to last long, so it would be a problem if replacement ones weren't available.Of course, I would rather prefer if pads were more durable in the first place, but those headphones are built to be cheap and easy to wear, so there isn't really much of a reason to complain."
4,Perfect for my Plantronics DSP 400 headset,"My ear pads on the DSP-400 were totally shot ... they disintegrated over the last 2 years. I bought these replacements and they were the perfect size. All you have to do is pry off the plastic holders on the outside of the earpiece, remove the rags of the old pads, put on the new ones, and replace the holders. These come 4 to a pack so I'm set for a few year.These are very fragile though ... I cut one with my fingernail when I tried to replace the holders! So please be careful."
3,More oval than they look in the pic,"I bought these as replacement covers for some Koss headphones. I thought the covers I was buying were round, but they are actually very oval, and are bigger than I realized - they have a hard time staying on the average sized earpieces of my Koss headphones. I wouldn't buy these again."
3,Could have been better but we'll see,The First problem was one of the pads was flawed... it had a couple of holes in it coming out of the package. The ones that were not damaged have been great so far... We'll have to see how long they last before they come apart...
4,very good book - could use less fawning,"This book does an excellent job of describing the plots, settings, and characters of the stories of all Shakespeare's plays. The author also provides good background detail of the time, relevant facts from Shakespeare's life, and some not-excessively-detailed analysis where appropriate. My one small complaint with the book is that the author is so deeply in love with the works and the very idea of Shakespeare that she rarely lets an opportunity pass to tell us how wonderful he is. (The level of fawning and gushing is sometimes reminiscent of listening to a fourteen year old girl talk about Justin Timberlake.) But apart from this minor complaint, I heartily recommend the book -- it's quite readable and the overall scholarship is outstanding."
2,Needs more thoughtful design.,"The photo transfer program that comes with the camera is very rigid and does not allow many variations on the save options like other camera systems do. I like to set up different folders for each day that i download the pics and i haven't figured a way to do this using only a couple of key strokes. I use windows xp and the resident file transfer programs will not recognise the camera using the USB connection. I have been using a card reader to download my pictures. This works very well except the memory card is under the same cap as the batteries and every time i pull the card out, the date on the camera has to be reset. This is a pain especcially if you like to use the date stamp. I do hope that someone at sipix reads this and makes some changes."
1,I wish I could give this book less stars.,"Honestly, the animorphs is getting old. Same introduction, same villians, etc. So what if they get new morphs? They're getting predictable. There's no more secrets to reveal...anyway, I think K.A. Applegate should start a new series."
5,Great Book!,"The Hidden is a really good book! All real Animorphs fans will love it. K.A. Applegate really has a way of not letting people get tired of her series, Animorphs. I think Animorphs is a lot better than Everworld. Sorry, but Everworld is getting really kind of boring. It's not the greatest series in the world."
3,A Fairly Decent Book,"People often dislike books that focus on ethics rather than action; I usually beg to differ. The Hidden, however, was one of those books that has a lot of action and some plot holes to go with it. I think the writer should have put more effort into this book. It seemed very rushed. I disagreed with the morality issue because logically, it's incorrect. I still recommend this book because it makes you think, and come to your own conclusion about sentience. The ending was interesting, although slightly unrealistic, and it was a fairly decent book. I definitely recommend all Cassie books because her qualms are, at the very least, nearly on-target. The ethical questions are my favorite part of this series.Also recommended: #7, #19, #23, #26, #33, #41, #43, #48, #49"
2,Baadddd,"This book was so wierd, it creeped me out. A)The whole thing with the morphing buffalo? Come On! B)Cassie's moral thing is getting old. She shouldn't care so much about every little thing.They're fighting to save the world, not every tiny animal that might get hurt. C)I never liked the Helmacron thing at all."
1,Horrible,"Personally, I hated this book, all because of the blue box horrible things occur, and it is a horrible experience for them all, inlcuding Cassie."
3,For Disney Fans....,"This really is not a toy thus the rating ""as a toy"".It is a well made and visually colorful desk accessory for Mickey Mouse enthusiasts.I purchased on sale as a gift. Not sure I would have paid over 20.00 for it.The recipient loved it."
5,"A sweet book, thoughtful and learned too","I bought this book primarily for the bestiality chapters, but found it mouch more than just that. Insightful and fun. It was a great read. Thanks!"
1,Tasteless and uninspiring,"_Dog Love_ reads like a dry PhD dissertation; as a former college instructor, I can appreciate the research involved in this text. That said, the chapter entitled ""Sex and the Single Dog"" contained a litany of references to bestiality in literature. My concerns are for readers, especially the young and their guardians, who expect to read stories of inspiration but are instead inducted into a perverse exploitation of dogs. Kudos to Amazon.com for warning readers through reviews such as this [unlike one of your competitors who has now lost my business]."
2,Black faded at first wash...Disappointing!!!,"I thought Ultra Force is a good company with quality products, but now i know and i am not going to buy another Ultra Force product in my life.These pants were not available in any other european online shop...so i had to choose an american online retailer who can ship to Eastern Europe.I paid a 35$ postage fee for a 35$ cargo pant...can't wear anymore, the black colour looks 15 years older just after 5 washes.I am definitely going to post pictures...to warn others"
4,Haunting,The movie kept me interested throughout. I sat wanting to know more of what was going to happen with the characters of the movie.
2,Bogus Production and Publication of this Book!,"I have read this book, Lady Chatterly's Lover, several times, but was really surprised by the format and publication of this copy. There were several things that I was suspicious about that made me feel like this was definitely a bogus copy. The format of the writing and pages were terrible with lots of spacing within the paragraphs and sentences. When I looked for a copyright , publication or date published there was nothing on the tittle page, on the book or in the back of the book. There was nothing! How can Amazon sell or have a seller send out a bogus book ? Aren't there certain copyrights on books that have already been published and if some one produces a copy of that book, shouldn't there be some identification as the the who, what and where it was published??? Don't have my shipping information and can't pull it up on my account, but would like to identify the seller and report them to the Amazon police!!!!!"
5,Just as fun now as when I was a child!,"I read this in 5th grade, about 1980, and loved it then. I just finished reading it to my own kids (8 & 6) and they loved it just as much as I did."
1,No Good,"Uhg! What junk! When I was a kid 40 years ago, the walkie-talkies we played with were better than this junk. My son got this as a gift from the g-parents if I recall right, some 4 years ago. The charger is poor to say the least, and the unit is very difficult for a kid to understand how to use it properly. When you can get it to charge, it always takes awhile to figure the thing out again. Do not buy this junk."
5,One of my favourite parenting books!,"This is one of my favourite parenting books, along with other books by the same authors. What I really like about it is that the book focuses on prevention and on how to raise children, not just what to do when there are problems. I highly recommend this book!"
4,Beware of the moon,"What can I actually, say about this film? See it and you will love it! I guess I can tell you the story, but I'm not going to tell what happens in the end. First of all, these two amrecain boys, are in England, While in England, a wareworlf attacks them and kills one of then (grossem i know!) But leaves a scar on the other boy. Because of that scar, every full moon he will turn into a WEARWOLF! (ahh!) Now the boy has to chosse to kill himself (how deppressing!) or kill lot's of people as a wearwolf. Watch it to find out."
4,BUY IT!,THIS IS THE MOVIE THAT ONE AN OSCAR IN SCIFI HISTORY.IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF SPECIAL EFFECTS OF TODAY.
2,Not that great,"Based on the other reviews I expected some great things from this movie. I was very disappointed. It was more of a comedy version of a horror flick. It was just so unreal. The gory parts were realistic, but that was it. I would not recommend."
3,great film,"El sonido castellano que lleva incluído es el utilizado en la última versión (remasterizado) y después de unos minutos de sorpresa, te acostumbras al mismo. Los efectos en el sonido han recogido los del idioma original inglés y son muy,muy buenos (atención a los rugidos y aullidos del hombre lobo, no aptos para corazones sensibles, así como las imágenes de Griffin Dune como se va descomponiendo a lo largo del metraje de la película) . La imagen no es espectacular y conserva suciedad del metraje original (sobretodo al principio) pero globalmente la pelicula no desmerece en absoluto. Podrían haberse esmerado un poco más en la confección de esta película (al fin y al cabo, el Blu Ray representa una máxima calidad en imagen y sonido, aunque esta vez creo que han optado por ""el camino de enmedio"" y no se han esforzado demasiado).A destacar los extras, interesantes y variados; todos subtitulados."
4,Excellent werewolf flick,"what makes this movie so good,is the ability to get to know the man BEHIND the wolf. Phenominal special FX really keep your eyes popped and your mouth dropped....you really feel for naughton"
4,A true comedy horror.,"This is the original comedy-horror movie. The movie is a comedy, and it's funny, but it isn't silly the way most comedy-horrors are. The movie is also somewhat scary, too, and the excellent ending has to be seen to be believed! The only problem with this movie was that it was remade into the craptastic An American Werewolf in Paris."
3,After all these years still enjoy watching this movie,"HD-DVD reviewed in 1080iI am not going to review the movie wich has been done many times before, instead i am reviewing the HD-DVD DVD combo version.Picture quality is sharp and detailed, but the filmstock is very grainy wich distracts from the movie at some points.The audio is a 2.1 soundtrack wich is not very spacial.The audio commentary with 2 of the main actors is interesting but i wouldhave preferred a commentary with the director and filmcrew.The special features are on the Flip(DVD)side and are at best average.I wish they would have restored the movie in a quality that would made it worth buying this on HD-DVD even if you had the dvd version.Hence only the 3/5 stars."
5,mother of werewolf movies.,Two amercian kids attacked on the morse out side the slaughtered lamb in london.One dies one is cursed.The cursed one learns from his dead freind-he's a monster.And there goes the neighborhood.the fx is very good forthe time.the transfomation sequence has yet too be topped.not even the sequal in wwinparis comes close(general makeup should of stuck too this one too).As a kid this actually gave me chils(abit).As an adult well its still a great movie.
3,Nice try -- but not quite.,"There's a lot to like about American Werewolf in London -- and just as much that's aggravating and disappointing. Apart from David Naughton's thin performance in the lead role, the acting is solid, with Jenny Agutter the standout as a pretty young nurse who's a sucker for animal magnetism.The film snaps from comedy (some of which works, some of which doesn't) to fairly realistic gore -- with nightmare scenes that give the entire story a sense of the surreal which is fairly unusual in a mainstream film.The story is short and highly simplistic -- with little depth; the twists and turns, such as they are, simply don't engage.I like American Werewolf for its tone, its sense of freshness. It's a flawed film, but likely John Landis' best work."
4,The unresisting pressure of being a werewolf,"If you saw An American Werewolf in Paris, I am sure you didn't like it at all. Because it was a very bad version of An American Werewolf in London which is one of my childhood favourites. I always claim that old movies are more succesful than today's computer supported releases. This movie is a very good example to this. There are hundreds of werewolf movies but the only great transformation scene is in this movie which lasts at least five minutes. And then finally you really see a creature that resembles a wolf rather than a guy wearing a mask and fur. But my favouite scenes are the ones in which the disgusting faced victoms gives him advices for the ways of suicide. Maybe it's the joke of author or director, but you really enjoy it."
5,american werewolf in london dvd,Best horror movie ever plus pioneered the realistic special effect.no CGI can match old school efx.Proud to own this classic
5,"Over 20 years, and it's still scary!!","This movie is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen!! Makeup Artist Rick Baker is a genius who was ahead of his time. It's scary and funny at times, and you genuinely do care what happens to these characters. DVD has lots of extras to enjoy ."
4,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * * *,"Who would like this? : horror, cult classic buffsWorth seeing?...-buy it : yes-rent it : yesCast:David NaughtonJenny AgutterGriffin DunneJohn Woodvine___________________John LandisDirector* a classic horror with a little black comedy, suspense and Jenny Agutter. A must have for any horror fan."
4,"Wonderful fun, and scary!","This is a wonderful movie that has one sole aim: to entertain. Two American lads in Britain are attacked one dark night by a werewolf, and the fun is on! Great scenery and atmosphere, very very good special effects, and decent acting all come together with a brisk storyline to really keep this movie going. There are some cool shock scenes too, but that would be telling. Some cute English girls don't do this movie one bit of harm, either!This is a highly entertaining horror/comedy flick that elicits both chills and laughs. Great fun."
4,Beware of the moon!!!,"Excellent movie! The beginning of the film is downright scary. As the 2 characters wonder through the moors at night, and the werewolf is howling in the distance, then gradually gets closer and closer, scary stuff.Another awesome scene is in the subway. This movie still stands the test of time."
2,Meh,"heres my review on the movie which can also be found on rotten tomatoeslet me start off by saying: BOOOO! when i rented this i thought i was going to be seeing the one i remember so well, but turns out thats the sequel probably and not this movie, an hour and a half of mostly dissapointment, i mean the first transforation i guess you could call it happens about an hour into it, now i know its 1981 but cmon, could do better, as a die hard werewolf fan i was dissapointed in this film because some of it didnt even make sense, the sex bits that were here and there were nice but not needed in a werewolf film, im sorry to say that i do not reccomend this to any werewolf fan like me.your thoughts\opinions may differ"
1,Passing off inferior product,"I purchased this blu ray new, but the one I was shipped is clearly USED. The product had been re-shrink wraped; evidence of the original wrapping was stuck to the plastic case. There were fingerprints all over the disk. I haven't tried to play it yet, so don't know if it's scratched. Too bad, I was looking forward to this one.WAY TO GO AMAZON--Passing off inferior product at premium prices!!"
3,"GOOD MOVIE, BAD DVD RELEASE","This movie is a classic, First time when i saw it during the 80s it was so scary and the make-up effect was so impressive. However, this DVD release by Universal Studios is dissappointing.The picture is so soft similar to a VCD/VHS transfer and the audio, though originally recorded in MONO and upgraded to 5.1 and DTS surround, the effect is poor and soft. The movie needs a better treatment absolutely. Video : 3/5 (the picture is so bad when watching in widescreen format), Sound : 3/5 Movie :4/5.Other movie like Omen, Jaws 1, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, The Howling, I find the DVD picture are better than this one."
5,Really scary,"This movie is one of my all-time favorites!!! WHen I really want to watch a good scary movie, this is the one I watch. Jack's friend who is killed by the werewolf is actually funny while at the same time, he is gory. The werewolf transformation is good in a period of time when they didn't have all the incredible special effects that we have now. What better setting than London and the moors for a full-moon, werewolf movie!!!"
3,classic,"award winning movie for the wolf transition , done before digital effects , a landmark film of sorts , stars the dr.pepper guy ""I`m a pepper"" , his victims [ corpses ] haunt him through the movie [ see American Werewolf in Paris ] good if you are a fan of classic horror.. but ,not as scary as :The Thing"
1,Worst werewolf movie,"I know a lot of people out there love American Werewolf in London but hate American Werewolf in Paris which i don't understand. American Werewolf in London is the worst werewolf movie i have seen if you want to see a proper good werewolf movie you should see the Howling not this. Also they say the movie is funny its not i only got a laugh out of it because of the thought the main female character had had sex with a werewolf besides that its boring. Seriously i love werewolf movies don't get me wrong but the werewolf in this film more looks like an over inflated hairy balloon with legs and a dog mask, it's nearly as bad as the bald, over sized annerixic hampster of a werewolf from Harry Potter 3. In short don't see this film other wise you'll want to watch something else remotely tasteful to wash out the bad taste"
2,2 stars for the good for special effects,"I guess I have grown out of horror films. Amazon had the Blu-Ray on sale for $9, so I thought I'd like to see this one again after 3 decades, and while I still liked the special effects as I did when I saw them originally, the rest of the movie just didn't do anything for me. I should have passed on this one."
4,Werewolf,"The package was received with the product inside.This item was given out for Xmas, so I have NO real idea if the product works or not."
4,Still holds up,"This movie was originally lauded for Rick Baker's special effects makeup. Although when compared directly to today's CGI it is klunky, the transformation scene is nonetheless startling.But this movie is about more than special effects. It is directed and edited in a way that keeps you off-balance. You find yourself laughing at talking, decaying corpses. You find yourself on the edge of your seat while following a businessman through the narrow passages of the London tube. You find yourself pulling for a protagonist who ultimately can only have one solution to his problem.It is among my favorite of the monster genre."
3,More stupid than good,"An American Werewolf in London disappointed me. There was too much humor, too many living-dead people, and the werewolf was too small. The turning scene was pretty good, but not as good as THE HOWLING."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,i know of course that this is a classic without saying but come on this blu ray was a joke. the color was in and out and there were only a couple of seens in general that were quality. i have 50 blu ray all of which are older movies as i dont watch most of new hollywood. and this is by far the worst i have. compare to CREEPSHOW for example this blu ray is what its all about a stunning disc to say the least. so if you already own this dis on dvd i would not waste my money like i did.
4,American Werewolf in London,"Good old movie. Grandchildren, seeing it for the first time, were not nearly as frighten as I was the first time I saw it."
4,Killer movie,"I can't compare the blu-ray quality to that of a dvd since this is the only copy I've owned. The blu-ray only cost me $12 or something though so that's a great deal to me! In terms of the movie, this is one of the best werewolf movies of all time and hands down, has the best werewolf transformation scene of any other movie. There are certain aspects of the movie that can really creep the viewer out, and then there are some scenes that are purposefully cheesy. Eitherway you love it or don't. I love it!"
3,The movie is very nice. Good to review it and remember good times.,"The movie is very nice and it's good to review it and remember the good times. But, as a Brazilian, and considering that the blu-ray region refers from North America to South America, I thought the subtitles would be in Portuguese fom Brazil, not from Portugal. There is a significant difference between both."
4,Horror comedy that's actually scary and funny,"John Landis movies usually have a strange blend of subtlety and low-brow, and this is no exception. The scary moments are memorable, and the black comedy of the frequent visits by the deceased is funny, grisly and even a little haunting. But I still don't understand that weird dream sequence where David Naughton's family is killed by demonic Nazis..."
5,"FORGET THE HOWLING, THIS IS THE REAL WOLF DEAL!!!!!!!","I love the fact that this movie was directed by John Landis. John's directed Animal House, Trading Places, Oscar and Coming to America. Seeing as how his buisness is Comedy, he shares this horror/comedy film which is without any doubt THE greatest werewolfer of all time. The only other werewolf pic I really liked was Silver Bullet, and American Werewolf just kicked that one aside. I love this movie. I loved the bitter sweetness of it. I loved the characters. I loved the music(even though I listen to Korn And Deftones). This is a wicked a** movie that kicks a** in every way. I loved the ending which was absolutely perfect(no fuss no muss). A really beautiful movie. See it!"
5,This was fantastic!,"This is a great film, and the special effects are crazy. The movie is scary, funny, and sad all at the same time. Highly recommended!"
2,Great movie...not the greatest blu ray transfer.,Love this movie so I had to get it on blu ray. The video quality was avg to sub par and the audio was even worse. Save yourself the bucks and by the regular DVD and if you have a blu ray player that up-scales you'll probably like it better. Not worth the investment.
1,Avoid!,"This game is built on the Steam engine, so my advice is steer clear. What this means is that the DVD you buy doesn't have the game on it -- it has Steam, which is a nasty spyware-like lurker that sits on your PC running continuously. So first you install Steam, then you let it update itself. THEN you can type in your serial number and download the game, for which you have to be online of course -- my connection is poor, so this took about 4 hours. THEN you can finally play the game. Except that Steam crashed, then wouldn't start, then wouldn't run without an active Internet connection (as it's supposed to). After several reboots, I finally got the game to go -- for a few minutes, then it crashed. That seems to be as far as I can get. I've had this kind of problem with every other Steam game I've tried -- never again."
5,Superbly arranged melodic rock,"This is a tremendous up-beat album. Even if you have never heard of Cliff Richard you'll enjoy this album--it's so well-crafted and sung and a little edgier than many of his releases. Cliff had been in the business for 20 years when he released this, and he certainly knew what he was doing (thank-you Bruce Welch). Now it's 20 years later, and the man is still releasing albums. The next one will be out in November 2001. Rock on, Cliff!"
2,Stuck with a nice item that will not work as offered.,Nicely constructed item but it doesn't work as expected. Compression stockings do not fit properly and setting up for inserting ones foot just cannot happen. I called the company and they refuse to accept a return stating that I must contact the shipper. I cannot find that information so it appears that I may be stuck with a bad product. Help please!!
5,Finding threads...,"Amazing what a little time and effort will do to help uncover a phalanx of fiery talent in yet another genre. Not knowingly listened to Goth per se, though alternative could describe the trend lately, I was enthralled with the pounding anger and raw emotional bursts of Kidneythieves' Zerospace. I know how this will sound but it invoked at times images of Pat Benatar in her raging early days, but then becomes it's own tasty dish in songs like Timebomb. I'm only afraid I'm going to wear it out mentally by listening to it so many times!"
5,One of my most favorite bands now,"A unique new sound along with the amazing vocals of Free Dominguez. If you goto their site you will see that they had a great inspiration from Nine Inch Nails, and even had one of their members help them with the album. Not only would I HIGHLY reccomend this album, but get their other album, or even BETTER, their CD/DVD combo which has all the songs of their older album, but added tracks along with the DVD having live concert footage, and the videos for Zerospace and Taxicab Messiah. With a little more publicity, I see KidneyThieves being the next big thing."
1,Music is great - enhanced CD is crap! Installs itself like a virus,"This CD is pretty decent - I agree with the consensus here. I give the CD 4.5 stars overall.However, I'm just here to warn you about the enhanced CD - don't play it on your computer. It tries to install something on your hard drive like a virus, and connect to their web site.I denied it internet access, and denied permission to install (I'm running XP). But it continued to try to install itself, and search for an internet connection. So I just ejected it and played it on my regular CD player.But now, two days later, it's still trying to install itself. It's crashed my computer about 5 times, and every time I reboot, it looks for this stupid program. I've run Crap Cleaner's uninstall function, Spyware Search & Destroy, AdAware... it even tried to set it's own permission settings on Zone Alarm! I have to treat this thing like a regular virus.So don't try to play this on your PC."
5,KidneyThieves Kick A**,"It is hard to find a cd where you can listen to every track and actually like every song. This is one of those rare bands that can put out just enough to fill you up and leave you wanting more. I HIGHLY recommend this cd, this band, thier first cd Trickster and their single Phi in the Sky that was remixed by some amazing talent including KMFDM."
4,Zerospace,"Kidneythieves and Earshot were the only bands I liked on the Queen of the Damned soundtrack. I bought them both and I like ""Zerospace"" a lot more than Earshot's ""Let Go"". Their music is incredible. A must have!"
5,Killer Album,"I have never heard of the Kidneythieves until I saw them opening for Tommy Lee. This band rocks!! Kidneythieves put on a great show. Free's voice is awesome. If you are a fan of industrial, ""Zerospace"" is the album for you. BUY THE CD!! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!"
3,Nothing special,"Over the summer, I saw KidneyThieves as one of the opening acts to my favorite industrial band KMFDM. I wasn't too terribly impressed with what I heard. I didn't think that they were bad but definitely not a good representation of the genres of goth and industrial music. Their music is more metal than goth and industrial. I really didn't care for their version of ""Crazy"". When I saw a copy of ""Zerospace"" in the used cd bins this past weekend, I thought I would give KidneyThieves another chance. After listening to the cd a few times, I can't say that there is anything to write home about other than this band is neither industrial or goth. Their music certainly has elements of industrial and goth music but their sound definitely is neither. I would say that they are more metal."
3,"Zero space, zero creativity","Yeah, trust Yoshiki to have produced a band like this, it's part of his obsession with America. Honestly, Taxicab Messiah was their only good song and hey, it's not even on this album. The vocals are alright but they sound the same across each song. If you want a good side though, Zerospace beats a lot of other Industrial artists in America."
5,One of the best albums of the 2000's,"Comments about a few of the tracks:Before I'm Dead - great song, great message. The acoustic version off Tricksterreprocess might be even better.Zerospace - so much energy (and venom).Arsenal - great overall sound, very unique.Black Bullet - another high energy track.Dyskrasia - an all time fav song of mine. Worth the price of the album alone.Serene Dream - this song took a while to grow on me, now I love it. So beautiful.Crazy - not generally a fan of covers, but this one is damn good. A great angry love song.Overall this is a really strong rock album, one of the best I have ever heard. I've listened to this for nearly 10 years now and it still sounds fresh. My favorite album from one of my favorite bands."
5,Very Much Worth It,"This is a wonderful collection of songs ranging from the morbidly poetic to some of the catchiest tunes. I bought it on a recommendation from a friend of mine and I was definitely not disappointed. The lead singer has an amazing voice that is both seductive and charged with spite (which can only be accompanied by the skilled band that has to be behind her).Reference Point (Other music I listen to): System of a Down, Rasputina, Meg Lee Chin, Static X, Tool, VAST...Kidney Thieves goes beautifully in a playlist of all of these."
4,Pretty Good,"MY best friend told me about Kidney Thieves, probably 9-12 months ago. I really liked the songs I had heard and when I just happened to glance down at the shelf while I was at a cd store with a friend, and saw the Zerospace CD, I had to buy it. Although, I must say, I was sorta disappointed. I only liked the songs that I had already heard, such as: Zerospace, Before I'm Dead, Glittergirl, Serene Dream, Crazy, and maybe one or two others. And besides those songs, I only liked 'Spank'. But, the good songs...are REALLY good, if that helps at all. I would recommend this cd, but I wouldn't stress to someone to buy it."
5,"HYPER HEAVY, SEXY AND AGRESSIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",I FOUND SOME PRETTY DAMN F***ING ULTRA HEAVY SONGS ON THAT ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE TRACK #2 WAS (AND IS) MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Hard if you like Britney,"I bought this album after reading all the great reviews, having followed links from similar music. This is about as boring a disc as i've ever heard, and definitely doesn't meet my expectations for this genre. get Luxt's Chromasex Monkeydrive or something from Assemblage 23 instead."
1,booksUneed4college&cheap,"I bought Grammar in Context 3, Fourth Edition (Student Book) (Bk. 3), but I received Grammar in Context 3, Fourth Edition (teacher's annotated edition Book) (Bk. 3), and I send a mail to booksUneed4college&cheap if I can return the book and get the right one, but didn't receive an answer"
5,Very true to the flavor of Shelley's novel,I found this to be an excellent play. It was obviously well researched and very true to the flavor of the original novel. This is not Hollywood's version of Frankenstein but a much more full bodied study of man's arrogance. I highly recommend performing it as well as reading it.
4,Fela - documentary,It presents Fela's career and life as a moving force against oppression with an old but effective battle weapon: music. A good documentary for a base understanding of a monumental artist.
4,A wonderful array of patriotric songs by two cute voices!,"What a wonderful CD... these children not only brought tears to my eyes with their version of Amazing Grace, I was deeply moved by their spirit and support of our American Troops.This CD is truly a work of love and is highly recommended."
5,Great,"It`s second hand one, but cheap.It`s second hand one, but cheap.It`s second hand one, but cheap.It`s second hand one, but cheap."
5,Beginner's Spanish,This book is easy to learn for those who have never had Spanish. It goes from the very basic to some intermediate level later in the book (we use the same book for intermediate Spanish). Includes pictures and conversations which are also very helpful.
2,Not in the condition I expected.,"While the book itself is correct, the condition of the book was less than satisfactory. More than half the pages were completed, several in pen.To me, that is not excellent condition, nor is it even very good."
4,Very fast shipping,Book ordered on Saturday afternoon. I received email Tuesday morning that the book had shipped. Wednesday morning it was in my mailbox. I love Amazon.com and their associate sellers!!
5,A good foundation builder for beginning Spanish,"I was introduced to this book as part of an adult/community education course on conversational Spanish that I took just after moving to San Antonio, Texas. This text does live up to its title by making the Spanish learning experience fun (and painless), even for students -- older as well as young -- with little or no prior exposure to Spanish. Although I have several other lesson books, I keep returning to this one for self-study and review. The lessons follow a clear and logical sequence that builds on the lessons before it. The cultural capsules are interesting, and the sections on conversation and dialog are useful tools for practice. The practical exercises help reinforce each lesson.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning Spanish and who wants a solid starting place to begin. Spanish Is Fun is a great foundation builder and a ""keeper"" for later review."
4,Caution . . .,I purchased Spanish is Fun and the workbook.I was looking for a home study course in Spanish and this is not it. I think if you're in a classroom situation the book would be wonderful.You need a Teacher's Manual and Key to get the answers for all quizzes and unit tests to make this useful as a home study course.
4,Lots of activities to practice,"I had taken 2 years of Spanish previously. It has been many years and I decided to take a local Spanish course. This book was broken in half for Spanish I & II. There are many activities after each lesson. There are also cultural notes which help in understanding the language a little better.The book progresses in an easy-to-follow format. It introduces many verbs and their usage. I wouldn't be comfortable enough writing this review in Spanish, it would take me a rather long time. But I have gotten to a point where I can make out what is being said on Telemundo and Univision."
5,Spanish book,Product was excellent and as advertised. It was shipped promptly and in suitable packaging. I would deal with this company again.
2,"more then half of the book have writing in the home work pages in pen, which means CAN NOT be erised.","more then half of the book have writing in the home work pages in pen, which means CAN NOT be erised."
5,Philips Keyring key019,"I am really satisfied with this amazing portable device, I have come to know about this product long back ago, about one and half year ago, this product have won so many awards in its categories.I was eagerly waiting for this product but was not able to purchase as it was not available where I was living.I really was impressed by picture quality, well not truly amazed but satisfactory. Some time pictures washout from the corner I don't know why? The movies capturing also good but some time washout!But overall I am happy, I would be happy if 256MB or 512 MB storage would be there, 128MB is nothing, and maybe Philips will update it soon or come out with new model. In my opinion Philips should have expand memory at least 512MB, and i guess that would be sufficient, and flash would be good inclusion and if they can add optical zoom not digital but optical would be great.Good product, full marks to the Philips for amazing product, I love it, it is very small and handy!,"
5,great item,the camcorder is a great item. i've had it for a few days now. it has a nice viewfinder to adjust the picture taking. it comes with an external battery pack for more power. the camera and camcorder quality was better than i expected. the sound quality was great for mp3's. i definitely recommend this.
1,Amateurish dabble at writing. Waste of time and money.,"This ""novel"" is so ill researched and so full of cliches that I dumped it after the fift chapter. Expensive even at the $2.99 price. Sometimes you can find a gold nugget or even a diamond among the pebbles. Rest assured this is not one. If you have nothing to read go download an old classic from the many freebies available. This one is not...a) A Thriller. Boring on the contrary.b) Well written. It's repetitive, full of clichés, feeble plotted and utterly predictable.c) Researched. The depth of the author's knowledge about the subject reeks of being limited to watching some bollywood films.It doesn't deserve even one star but there's no option for zero. Fair warning!"
4,Great classic Bluegrass,"This CD has a wonderful collection of bluegrass stand-bys -- by artists who are all well known for producing great bluegrass sounds. From the original bluegrass man himself, Bill Monroe, to the more modern Marty Stewart and Ricky Scaggs -- each track is simply lovely!Great instrumentals, and even better vocals."
3,"Good, but hardly comprehensive","This is a useful book in times such as ours if you find yourself in need of a short, pithy statement on nonviolence. It is a sort of ""wit and wisdom"" collection, with no passage longer than a few sentences. While that certainly doesn't allow the reader any in-depth study of Gandhi's philosophy, it is useful for readers already familiar with that philosophy who are seeking simple and quick access to essential statements."
2,I,"I would also have to say that the book is ""lacking"" because though the quotes are interesting and give you some insight about his thought process and a bit about his feelings, if you are unfamiliar with his teachings, or know little of him in general you will find it difficult to identify with and understand why he thinks and says the things he does. Thus, for the uninitiated it may seem a bit too dry."
5,Oldie but goodie,This is an older movie but IMO a real good movie. I would like to see a remake on dvd to add to my dvd collection.
2,Get a proper compilation and avoid this ugly retread --,"In this 1979 video, Granny looks for a toon to play the bunny in her easter production. Bugs and his pals audition for Granny with clips of their classic shows; the easter plot is just an excuse to revisit the same old cartoons. And as in most retrospectives, the older material is much better than the filler: in this case it's funnier, more vibrant, and has vastly superior voice acting and animation. Shamefully, the glorious classics are cut into the newer junk with such butchery their genius is nearly ruined, and my friend and I decided we'd prefer them in their original state."
4,"Good, but entry level",It can get people headed in the right direction but is not the be all to end all on the subject. Recommended if you are just starting to venture into this topic.
5,For all fans!,"This incredible CD is one all r&b fans should get their hands on! The song topics span from depression, trying to understand what lovers want, to uplifting songs that are ""our song""! In ""I Don't Ever Want To See You Again,"" Uncle Sam gets some wonderful backup help from Boyz II Men. It also features other great hits like Can You Feel It"" ""Without Lovin' You"" and ""Think About Me"". Uncle Sam has used his entrancing voice and rhythm sense to make a CD to listen to all night, over and over......."
4,Twistedly interesting,"An unusual retelling of Snow White, I think Tracy Lynn did I good job. The climax was interesting, and she made it neat because even though many people have read the story Snow White over and over, it's really hard to predict the ending of this story.Like the usual story of Snow White, Jessica grows up motherless, but in this story her father is still alive and he is the Duke of the land. Jessica's father remarries finally, to a beautiful--gorgeous--and well educated woman who thus becomes the duchess. Instead of being a witch, Jessica's stepmother is more of a mad scientist, and that's where the story of Jessica ends, and the story of Snow begins.I really don't want to tell the climax or the ending, because it's fun to let readers imagine what might happen. It makes you wonder what other twists Tracy Lynn has in store for the reader.What a page turner, I finished this book in about a day."
4,Snow,"I am a great lover of fairy tales and Snow White was always my favorite when I was little, so I couldn't wait to pick up this book. I have to admit to being a little disappointed though. I absolutly loved the beginning and everything that led up to Snow becoming a slave in her own house. Her friend Alan was one of my favorite charaters; he was such a loving, friendly person who Snow could always count on to be there for her. The only part I really did not enjoy was the idea of the Lonely Ones. While I liked the idea of them being outlaws and not dwarfs, this idea of the Queen creating these outcasts was just too bizarre. Especialy since Snow doesnt even end up with a prince, or even with a regular person (you'll know what I mean if you actually do decide to read this). While I throughly enjoyed all the rest of the twists in this classic fairy tale, it would have been much more enjoyable if the Lonley Ones weren't who they were."
5,A Must-Read For All Fairy-Tale Lovers,"This book is the most beautiful retelling of the classic story of snow white. I normally am not a fan of the story of snow white, but this book definitley showed me the magic of the story. Tracy Lynn took a completley different angle. The vain queen is a scientist (this is how she achieves her ""powers""), the magic mirror is the fiddle boy, charmed to tell the truth, and the ""seven dwarfs"" are actually a group of half-humans, half-animals that call themselves the Lonely Ones. I know this all sounds very strange, but it is much cooler than it sounds. The Lonely Ones are sad creatures that take in Snow as one of their own and grow to love her and protect her from her evil stepmother. Cat, Raven, Chauncey, The Mouser, and Sparrow are all great characters and Jessica (Snow) is also pretty deep. This story has the greatest love twist i have ever read in a book. This book is a must-read for all fairy tale lovers! its so beautiful."
3,"Interesting, Not The Best","This was a really strange retelling of the classic story 'Snow White'. It was the first book I read from the 'Once Upon a Time series' and I found it not as exciting as another book in the series such as Spirited. This book was just really weird. It kind of went out of whack and went into a really weird version that I didn't find very much related to the original story of Snow White. I don't like when the characters are to naive, it just makes you want to not read anymore if it gets to cheesy. I didn't find the romance was very romantic because Snow's romance was with a deformed strange creature. Not to be mean or anything but I find books a lot more romantic when there are handsome characters and not such a weird story line."
5,Compltely Unexpeted,"When I first bought this book I had no expectations. I fact, I didn't follow the cardinal rule and I bought it for the cover. A crime, I know. I was bored one day when I noticed it lying on my bedside table. Upon picking it up I found I couldn't put it down. This is a Snow white type story since I was little and the babysitter made us watch Snow White until we screamed. I still can't watch the movie, 10 years later. But this book brought my interests back to life. With it's own twist to the story, and no dwarves in sight this story is wonderful. That isn't to say that something doesn't take the place of the beloved dwarves. This book has in-depth characters that you can really have fun getting to no, and the villain is one of the best in any book I've read. If you love fantasy books, there is definitely something hidden in this book for you!"
1,Just go watch the movie,"I really don't understand why anyone would want to read a movie tie-in version of this story. A movie tie-in book is created when someone throws the script at an author and says ""Turn that into a book so we can make some more cash."" Absolutely nothing new is added, no background, nothing...and it is true here. If you want background on how the story came about, go read the original book on which this movie and the original movie is based: Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle which can be found right here on Amazon. It was written in the 50s (or 60s), and is COMPLETELY different than Tim Burton's movie or this tie-in novel. But that's not a bad thing because it is infinately more cerebral...and it's simply a better story."
4,Very nice marker,It comes empty but is a great market for all your needsyou have to use a ink that is not to thin because it will leak too muchmarsh ink or t-grade ink will work!
5,GREAT HOLIDAY ALBUM,"A definate must have for any Kenny Rankin fan. This was done only a few years before Kenny passed away, and has his two daughters singing back up vocals on it...beautiful."
5,Manga Blast,"The fifth graphic novel in Clamp's X manga series is nothing short than stunning. The complex storyline continues to unfold as more characters are introduced into the scene and as the Seven Seals are almost complete establishing their ranks. This book shows how far Clamp has come in terms of art, and the stroyline continues to be as gripping as it was if not more. If you want to get into the X/1999 scene and don't feel like buying the other novels, this is a good place to start."
5,Manga at its best,"Overall, X/1999 is an increadible series. CLAMP is knownfor its breathtaking pictures. The story is semi-gothic. There ishumor, and some romance, and a lot of action/battle scenes, and somegore. Even though it is a ""save the world"" type story, it is much darker than other mangas, such as Sailor Moon. It is a bit more mature,and gruesome. An added bonus is the side story that concentrates on one character, at the end of the book.This book introduces two dragons of heaven-Karen (who looks like she stepped out of a Victoria's Secrets catalogue, and Yuzuriha Nekoi, a chipper 14 year old girl who slightly resembles Hikaru from ""Magic Knights Rayearth"" (in personality.)Overall, this is one of the best manga's I've ever read. While the story may at first appear to go too slowly, there is a slew of interesting characters that are developing, and the most beautiful artwork of ANY manga. END"
3,Weird religious pictures,"The artwork in this book is very enjoyable, but the text just seems flat to me. I'd look at the picture on each page and smile, then read the words and feel bored. I also don't care for the witch climbing in through the window - it's odd and feels out of place, and may be scary for young children who are already concerned about things under the bed and in the closet; mostly it's just unoriginal. I'd rather not know why the transformation occurred (as in Imogene's Antlers, she just wakes up that way). And has anyone else noticed the very religious pictures decorating the walls of the house? Is that a picture of Lazarus walking out of the tomb? A Roman soldier asleep in front of Jesus's tomb? On pages where Mom is holding Nicholas, there are pictures of Mary holding Jesus. It's weird, and a little creepy, like subliminal messages.Overall, an interesting idea, worth looking at once, not a must have."
1,Disappointing...,"Being a strong believer of Cranial Work, I was very excited to see a new book on the topic. However, I was disappointed that this book is basically just Sutherland's Cranial Osteopathy and Upledger's CranioSacral Therapy repackaged. It's very disappointing that as Cranial work is getting more and more accepted, so many authors are simply reinventing the wheel and calling it their own. The initial work of Sutherland and the subsequent developments of Upledger have yet to be substantially changed or enhanced by any other authors in the cranial field that I have found. Until then, my recomendation is to stick with works by Sutherland and Upledger."
3,Underlining in orange and yellow,"The book arrived very promptly. It was listed as having a little wear on the cover which was true. However, pages 3-18 were heavily underlined in yellow and orange. The orange bled through to the opposite pages. I felt the seller had not been honest. I would never have bought the book if I had known this."
3,A Good Start,"This is a very simple book. Overly simplistic, but it is a good book to get comfortable with marketing your art. I think that may be its greatest value. Marketing is often times over whelming and this book does a good job making hte beginner feel comfortable with the process."
3,Not enough color pieces...,"Although the full-color paintings were VERY good, there just weren't enough to make this a satisfying book. I buy painting books to see full color paintings, and if the book lacks in that department I'm going to be disappointed."
3,"Careful, the other reviews are a little deceptive.","I was under the impression that this was a novel based off the original graphic novel's storyline, but it is simply a version of the screenplay from the movie. Caveat Empor, I guess."
3,An O.K. film novelization,"I saw the film a few years ago and thought it was O.K., with the exception of Sean Connery, who does a spectacular job in all his roles. The novel, which of course includes parts cut from the film and surprisingly cut the ending from the film out. Overall, Anderson does a good job converting the screenplay into a novel. He follows the path until he cut that ending.This is a good novel for some one looking for a quick read.PARTY ON, DUDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,This is the movie's screenplay,"If you want to read Alan Moore's work, do not get this! The screenplay has a storyline that is very different than Moore's original graphic novel. Reasons to get this version1) You want to relive the movie2) You are a big fan of Dorian Gray (who is not in Moore's original)3) You like Siberia depicted in comic books.4) You are not interested in edgy mature graphic novels like Moore's.Personally, I found the storyline of Moore's original much more interesting and have no plans to want to relive the movie."
5,A book that authors could be proud of,"I have to admit that the first time that I met the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was on the big screen. It wasn't until I did further research that I found out about the series of comic books. However, after reading this movie novelisation I thought it wouldn't have done justice as a comic book. As a novel Kevin J Anderson brought out the actors who played the characters on the big screen as well as the characters from their corresponding classics. It was that that made the book worth reading.A great book turned out from a great movie. Absolutely brilliant."
4,A Pocket for Corduroy by Don Freeman,"At the laundromat, Corduroy gets out of the chair that Lisa had told him to stay in while she was helping her mom put her clothes in the washer. He looks around the laundromat for a pocket. He found towels and washcloths. Then he found a laundromat bag that had just come out of the washer. He got into the bag and as the artist was putting the clothes into the dryer, Corduroy tumbled out. He was all damp. The artist dried Corduroy's overalls and left him on top of a washer because he didn't know who he belonged to. That night, Corduroy stayed in the laundromat alone. He looked for a pocket again. He pours out a box of detergent chips that he thinks is snow and he thinks he is skiing but he is really sliding into a basket. He thinks that he's in a cage which he doesn't want to be in. He falls asleep...I would recommend this book to anyone who has read other books done by this author. If you liked his other books, you will love this one. I loved it!"
4,A Pocket Full Of Fun............,"Teddy bears and kids go together like peanut butter and jelly. This classic children's story sticks well together,and the kids are sure to be stuck too.This little bear is a bit shy. He is almost childlike going through the various motions of his adventure. Being of a child's view point is a huge plus with young children. He is faced with obstacles a toddler may have to deal with."
3,Meh.,"In many ways, this is just a reprisal of the original book.Corduroy is out and about, he hears a comment that makes him think is outfit is lacking in some way (this time, he doesn't have a pocket), he goes looking for it, he gets lost and stays the night away from his friend Lisa, he makes a number of naive comments about his situation, he gets found, Lisa helps him with his outfit.It's not a bad book, it's just not very original."
2,Not at all what you'd think,"Yes, it's subtitled ""a romance of the Dark Ages,"" but everyone neglected to mention that its main theme is homosexual romance. From the reviews, I expected the history and historical figures of the time, not an unrelieved series of sexual invitations, genital explorations, and young boys offering themselves for such service. The first few chapters were enough to make me want a refund. Mr. Massie's style is well-suited to story-telling, and that's why I gave the book two stars, but if you want more story than sexual adventures, read Gillian Bradshaw. This book is going in the trash."
1,Eco or Massie?,"How many of the ""boy-encounters-everyone/everything-in-his-time"" books are going to be published? This one is as bad as ""Baudalino,"" a novel I have no idea why Eco published. This incoherent book is simply awful. Don't bother. If you want a really good evocation of Honorian times read Breem's ""Eagle in the Snow."""
4,Cool Product Super Fast Shipment!,I purchased this as a last minute gift for a co worker. The sellers communication was great! Shipping was super fast.Very cute Knight Light. :)ThanksJanet
2,Bad INTEL SATA,"Same problem as others noted with Intel SATA on RAID mirror. Had to pay Best-Buy to debug it for me, and they just said that the Intel SATA was no good and to use the promise controller. After that it worked OK for a long time. I still had to replace a cable once."
1,USB problem with P4C800-E,"I spent a couple of weeks building a computer based on this board. When it came time to use it, all USBs on the board blew the first time I plugged in my MP3 player. It's clear from the web that many other people have had the same experience. I'm livid. I wouldn't advise touching this board with a bargepole."
1,Junk cable,This brand of very poory made.It failed after 9 months.Just after the 6 month warranty ended.Stay away this brand!It has potmetal mount that attachs to the firewall.The cable rub though intershielding and the pedal is stiff.
2,my review,"The title of this book is an oxymoron.Randle proves nothing here. Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.Another thing, Randle's writing is too repetitive. Thin on facts, long on conjecture."
5,"Great, simple game","I'm pretty big into board games, and this is one of the best I've come across for being fun and simple. The rule book is only 8 pages long, including tables and pictures. Can't wait to get my hands on the expansion deck and some other boards."
4,Power Grid boardgame - a great balance of planning and interaction,"My family and I have played dozens of different boardgames over the past 20 years, mostly the euro-style games (e.g., Carcassone, Puerto Rico, Dominion, Race for the Galaxy.) We found this game to be a solid and fun addition to our collection. It's not a short game; and remembering all the rules takes a few plays. The anticipation of ""what power plants are going to be available?"" and ""what are my opponents going to do?"" makes the game absorbing and interesting. Definitely recommended!Power Grid"
5,Very pleased with Power Grid,"This game is awesome! I had never heard of it before and purchased it as a gift for my friend, now it's all we do. The product was immaculate, new and factory sealed as described. I was very pleased with my purchase and I look forward to future business."
4,Game box was crushed...,I got the game and its fun BUT the box was crushed on two of the corners and I couldn't even open it initially. I had to force it open and try to bend it back into shape and it just kind of looks trashy now. Other than that everything was good.
2,Lackluster strategy,"I love board games and am a huge fan of the Eurogames that have made the rounds on the circuit. I don't know why this game has gotten the buzz that it has. Each round is designed to equalize the playing field so that regardless of strategy, each player is always on roughly the same level. Personally, I like a game where your strategy can pull you ahead of the others, or where you can mass a power play and trump the other players, but that is impossible in this game. Those who fall behind one round are brought up the next round so that even players who haven't been paying attention have a shot to win at the end. What's the point to a strategy game if you don't actually need a strategy to win?"
3,Too complicated to be fun,"The game looked really cool online, so my husband and I bought it because it had so many great reviews. The game is kind of like ticket to ride meets monopoly, and it takes about two hours to play. I'm sure it'll be fun once we learn the rules more thorougly, but right now the game is so complicated, it's almost a chore. The game has all the fun of ticket to ride -- buying powerplants, connecting them, powering them, etc., with the long drawn-outedness of Monopoly. If you're patient, it has the potential to be a great game."
1,Many better options,"We bought Powergrid on the recommendation of friends, but disliked it. It basically seems like you head in one direction as fast as you can, and if you get ahead, it helps you get even further ahead. No real trade-offs. Eventually gave it away. Much prefer Wildlife (with modifications; otherwise the croc always wins), Tigris and Euphrates, Puerto Rico, and the like."
4,"Fun game, confusing instructions","Love the idea of the game, but it takes several triess to fully understand all of the rules. Very enjoyable and competitive once you understand how to actually play it."
3,Its Allright,I thought the book was pretty good all things considered. It may not have been his best but it does keep you wondering until the end. It was worth reading and over all was a good book
4,"A quick, cool novel...","This excellent novel is fast-paced and interesting until the very end. With unrelenting action that keeps you wanting to turn to the next page, or read the next chapter.I believe that this is the best Covert-one novel (although I haven't read the Altman Code just yet).If the synopsis of the story at the back of the book makes you think this book is unoriginal, think again. I thought the same thing and in the end I loved it!"
3,"Ok, not Ludlum","I believe that this book was published after Ludlam was dead, that doesn't make it awful I just don't think his name should be attached to itBasically the premise is the same as in the Hades Factor, except this time the autistic computer hacker has been replace with some Russian kid. Smith and his buddies must stop an international conspiracy before it kills a significant part of the population(I read this somewhere before didn't I?). The only reason this book is getting 3 stars is because of Peter Hoyle the British spy it was his activities in this book that, in my opinion pervented this from being a really bad book. It is still not up to snuf with the stuff that Ludlam was putting out when he was alive but it is not horribly awful.To sum it all up: The delivery system is different some of the names and faces have changed but if you didn't like the Hades Factor your not going to like this one."
4,Second part of the covert one series,"Almost as good as the firt one, the hades factor.Jon Smith is at his best again!great read!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The second of the Cover One series, again featuring the doctor-spook Jon Smith. He, and a group of allies must stop an opposing group of crazies doing bad things with a version of smallpox.The tiny ultra-clandestine agency again tasks Smith to look into this and stop it."
4,A Gripping Read,"Having never read the reviews before buying the book, I had no idea that so many people had negative views about it. I read it on a long flight and found it very entertaining. Yes, I agree there times when perhaps too much is required of your imagination and tolerance, but the story held me throughout right through to its fantastic (in its original meaning) end."
3,Chess revisiter,"I haven't played chess for a long time, so I picked up a few chess books from the library to refresh my memory.This is a good book for those more advanced than I am right now. I need to know more about strategy, tactics, and openings first.Silman explains various endings move-by-move, with frequent board illustrations.Unfortunately, these illustrations don't have the abc,123 notation (used in the text) on them, making following the moves difficult to follow for someone from the P to K3 era. I finally resolved this shortcoming by cutting an illustration-sized square out of a card, and labelling two of its sides with a-h and 1-8, to hold against each illustration.I'll return to this book when advanced enough to benefit more from it."
5,ANA,"NOT ONLY THE DELIVERY WAS EXTREMELY FAST BUT THE PRODUCT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY. PRODUCT IS DIFFERENT, LESS GREASY, NOT TO HARD TO CHEW AND FUN TO OFFER IN PARTY TRAYS. I LOVE IT."
2,Some bags were stale.,"I liked the taste of the bags that were sealed good, but probably about half of the bags were not sealed properly. The ones that were not sealed correctly tasted stale, so I was really disappointed with these. I have had this brand in a larger bag, and really liked them, so I don't know what happened, but I do know that I won't be buying these smaller size bags anymore! There were openings in a couple of the bags on the end, but most of them just did not have the air tight seal in the bag."
3,Amazon product not up to date,"While we love veggie stix, the product sold on Amazon does not reflect the company's most recent recipe. We bought these in the grocery store and they are fortified with lots of vitamins and minerals. The box we bought on Amazon is not. It's the same product, but it is older. The box we received also has an expiration date of just 2 months from now. We won't be able to eat all of them by that time so we're disappointed. I would not recommend buying these on Amazon until the company updates the product it is shipping."
1,Veggie chips,I did not like this product because the chips did not taste good. They also were very soggy when tring to eat them
4,Goood Snack,"These are really good but, I feel, a bit pricey. I've not seen these anywhere else, but then I haven't been looking. Good snack but not as healthy, I believe, as one might think, Still very good!"
5,Best Deal in Town,"I'm so happy with this purchase! Not only are the Veggie Stix great, but the portion control is so easy this way. AND the price is right, too. Adefinite win-win!"
2,Nope,"These contain more oil than they do any of those vegetables, besides the ""whole potato flour,"" which means these chips are made from dehydrated potato puree.They turn turn out tasting like those awful off-brand chips sold by crappy gas stations. Only a slight hint of spinach or tomato. Not much closer to a ""veggie chip"" than a McDonald's french fry. These chips also contain more fat per 28oz serving than McDonald's french fries.Also, their logo uses Comic Sans. Beware."
1,Expires too soon,I just got this product and the expire date is for March 2012! That's crazy. Not to mention how long the product took to get to me. I ordered several other things on the same day and this order came more than a week after everything else. Will not buy again!
2,greasy,"I chose these to have as a light snack being that they are only 130cal/package, which is 1 oz. They do the job and they are quite filling but they are soo greasy. It feels as though they just sit in my stomach and make me feel icky!"
1,Was a good idea for school lunches...BUT!,"So, so not fresh; they were stale. Stale. Stale. Stale, so stale. Disappointingly stale. Stale! And oh yeah, all the bags were stale."
3,Contains Vegetables,"Ten bags were consumed in eight days. If you are worried about not eating enough vegetables, this product is GOOD. The taste is great and as a snack or with soup or dip your guests will enjoy this vegetarian product. There are other Vegetable Chips that contain more nutrients but they are more expensive."
3,Too Oily/Greasy,"I got these, thinking that they'd be a good healthy snack, and they do indeed taste pretty good. But they are way too oily. I expected them to be more like Veggie Chips, which I really like. But they aren't.Hey, they might be healthy but it doesn't matter. They leave a greasy residue in your mouth/throat after eating just a handful of them. Just as bad as french fries."
1,No nutritional information,I would not buy this from Amazon because they have not provided the nutritional information on the package. I find it ironic that they provide disclaimers about reading the labels when they don't provide the information needed to make an informed choice.
2,You can't go home again,"I bought the original LP of this artist way, way back, at Val's Halla, a record store in Oak Park, IL, probably around 1970. Soup produced and marketed it themselves and I knew little about them except that they were from Appleton, WI and were a blues trio. Back then, I was 17 and they sounded great. Bluesy, rich with lived experience. Oh, how I wish I could say that this stood the test of time. Did I change so much or were they always this pathetic--and by that, I mean ""filled with pathos,"" emotions without connection. Oh, they are competent enough for a bar-based blues band, but despite the guitarist's life-challenges so richly detailed in these release notes, this CD more than most bears out Thomas Wolfe's warning that you can't go home again. Things are not what you thought they were."
4,Does the kind of meat matter?,"What can I say but ummm, that's good! I know it says Beef Marinade, I use it for pork baby backs. Give the ribs a 48 hour marinade and then smoke for 8 - 12 hours using Apple chips occasionally, toss on your favorite BBQ sauce and caramelize on the barbie - best ribs ever!"
5,The best marinade for meat!,"This is the only marinade we use on steaks. You can let the meat soak for hours without fear of too much salt flavor. In fact, the longer you marinade, the better the flavor.It is also the base of my 'secret' marinade for beef and chicken jerky.As said before, try it once and you will be a believer.Now I have a craving for a grilled Stubb's steak! It beats any restaurant steak."
5,Carrie really slays'em,"There's nothing very sinister or scary about this movie but it's searing portrayals of human animals and what they're capable of doing is brilliant. this is really a character study with a scattering doses of fantasy. piper laurie, as the lunatic mother of carrie white, should definitely have won the Oscar for best supporting actress just as Sissy Spacek should have been the best actress winner. i shudder to think that now that carrie II has been released and received only fair criticism, the floodgates will open and we'll soon have to suffer through increasingly inferior rip-offs like carrie III, carrie IV and so on until its drained dry. the beautiful musical score by pino dognacio is worth buying and listening to."
1,Still Not in Widescreen,"The 1 star is not for the movie. I love the movie. It is for this incomplete DVD presentation. If the film is only 1:85:1 why do are the opening credits cut off on both sides of the screen. Carrie was shot in classic Brian DePalma widescreen, and we still can't see it. Why? The Criterion Laser Disc jipped us and now this? What's with the conspiracy to keep DePalma's true vision from us? I just don't get. it."
