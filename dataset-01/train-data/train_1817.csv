3,WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHORT TITLE..,"War, Boy, Zooropa, Pop, Achtung Baby -- all delectable delights from U2. If the subsequent debacles in the form of ""All that.."" and ""How to dismantle.."" are any indication, U2 should stick to short-title cuts.If you've heard the pounding sonic boom of ""Vertigo"" and have your knickers in knots over the oh-so-hip iPod commercial, boy are you in for a gyp. The album is not half as crunchy as its lead song.Even if the monotony of music grows on you (at slug pace, if you are lucky) this is surely not Bono's lyrical peak. Give ""A Man and a Woman"" or ""Yahweh"" a peak if you wish to get a flavour of the most mawkish depths this band has fallen.I'd be the first to cheerfully recommend anything by U2 but this one's a tossup if not an outright dud."
3,Dismantle A Failing Relationship Perhaps?,"Fan of U2 for 21 years. I've listened to HTDAAB at least 24 times. One theme keeps popping up. Separation (or divorce), lots of kneeling or ""on my knees"" stuff going on (forgiveness, etc.). Which makes me think the CD Title (How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb) perhaps overlays with this. Maybe someone in the band is going through a spousal rough patch.(The Bomb being the failing marriage and how to stop it--again, seperation, a major blow-up, or disagreement and forgiveness repeats over and over as a common theme).Also it just really reeks of ""Abbey Road"" sentiments. Not that it sounds like the Beatles. Just very ""closure"" likeness...Could this be the Winter CD of U2? I hope not!Vertigo is the only ripping loud song on the CD. You really need to read the lyrics and dig-in to listening to this one. It's a thinker's CD. Yes, buy it."
1,a plague,U2 are a plague on music and their latest should have been dismantled before it was launched. There are no words to describe how bad this CD is without getting vulgar. None of the songs should have been released to the public to destroy what was left of our auditory nerves. Vertigo is like a plague that has spread across the land due to its use in those idiotic commercials and so all the sheep went and bought the CD just to spread this noise even more. We need to innoculate ourselves so we don't get the disease so similar to radiation poisoning that is HTDAAB. DOWN WITH U2 AND THIS CD!!!!!
2,Nothing New Here,"More U2. If you like this band, you'll like this CD. If your're looking for innovation, creativity, or surprises, they won't be found here, despite the spectacular prime time advertising. Too bad these guys can't break their own mold."
1,not a good album from U2,"first, i would to say this is a terrible, terrible, terrible album ever! U2 always shout like mad ppl in some of their song, i hate it much! They should not get 5 grammy this year b'coz there's a lot of quite good album and song deserves to get the awards. I think some who give five-stars to this album are the same person! This is not a great album although they had a lot of great song in the past. But i'm sure this is not a good album. U should not purchase it coz u'll regret."
3,Outstanding album...but not by U2 standards,"If just about any other band had recorded How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, it would be the best album in their career, without question. But when it comes to U2, it just doesn't quite measure up. It slows down way too much in the second half of the album, and it feels a bit too artificial. This is still a great piece of music, but in comparing to the most recent album from my other favourite band/artist, Matthew Good (any of you Americans who haven't heard of Matt Good...it's not a surprise, he has made little in the way of inroads into the States, but he has been quite possibly the best in Canada for 6 or 7 years now...check him out, I urge you), there's nothing on this album that stands out and leaves me wanting to hear it over and over again.U2 is still really good...but maybe slipping just a little."
1,I HATE THIS ALBUM!!!,'Nuff said. I don't think there's much left for me to say about this album that I haven't already said.
2,Problematic: Steer Clear!,"Nice design, but poorly made (cheap light-weight plastic, molded seams don't fit together). The dawn timing system stopped functioning 2 weeks after the one month return policy deadline! While it still turns on at the selected hour, it does not come on gradually. Instead it comes on abruptly which defeats the entire premise and purpose of being a dawn simulator (to mimic the sun's gradual rise). At this point, I might as well use a light timer for 10$ rather than what I paid for this system!!. Disappointed, and feeling ripped off! As an aside, I had the more expensive ""SunUp - Dawn Simulator"" which I loved but was destroyed in a house fire."
1,UGH...WAS I DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!,PROBABLY THE MOST BORING AND SLUGGISH LIVE CD'S I HAVE EVER HEARD. I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD( THIS BAND NORMALLY ROCKS LIVE ) DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS CD. IF YOU GET A LIVE CD FROM THIS BAND GET ONCE AND FOR ALL LIVE. MZA
5,"good cd, good lyrics","dennis lyxzen is able to move people with his words and music. and these five songs are more proof to that. I enjoy this more than international and i wonder why this wasnt released sooner. oh well, its out now. buy it."
3,Needs to be re-proofread,"It needs to be re-proofread, as the grammatical errors were numerous and distracting from the message. Otherwise, I thought the book had a refreshing standpoint on AA and long term sobriety."
2,little insight,an amature evaluation that takes too many words to make her point... rather tedious to read but makes some valid points
3,Good movie with a little cursing,"The plot is good, the acting is good and the scenery is good. The only fault I can find with this movie is the language. The cursing is mild with only a few uses of three different expletives. I have decided to rate (the many) movies I watch myself from the perspective of a Christian man looking for entertainment that won't teach my child to use curse words before her 3rd birthday. I deduct 1 star for 1 or 2 expletives and automatically deduct another star for 3. If I hear 4 or more or if any words are really offensive I stop it and it is rated 1 star regardless of any other considerations. There is no nudity or blasphemous content. This is one of those movies which makes no reference to God at all so it can't really be called Christian. The rating systems in place are not adequate so I write my own reviews; I hope to help others like myself who would like to be forewarned if a movie is not acceptable viewing for the entire family. This movie is not rated."
2,Okay movie....but,"It was an evening's entertainment. If you like the adventure of violent storm, graphic injury, with an aggressive bear on the chase, it could hold your attention. The story is of a step-mother and teen coming together, with the father actually paying attention to the teen. I see how it is the teen could say her step-mother was a know-it-all. She was a bit too well informed, even in my opinion. The teen does rise to expectation, but the wrap-up scene of a very pregnant mother, with a very revealing neckline was a very unexpected scene. It is not a movie I would choose to watch again, nor recommend to others."
2,it was ok.,"It turned out that I got the wrong movie. I was very dissapointed and want to return it for something else. Sincerely, Kathleen Cadigan"
3,its aiight,"Courage was overly dramatic and somewhat unrealistic! The movies soundtrack always indicated what was going to happen by the minute and therefore this ruined the suspense element. Overall, the movie had a great message surrounding around family, trust, faith n fate, and the power of courage and intuition. This movie is not the best but it's worth the thrill if your looking for a ""Anaconda"", ""Cast away"", or Perfect Storm knock off."
4,Great book for R90S enthusiasts,"For those who want to know details about this bike, this is the ultimate source of information. It has very nice pictures too."
5,All little fairies should own this cd,"While I'm sure it wasn't the artist's intent, he has created a favored children's cd.We needed fairy music for a fairy themed birthday party and this was better than we hoped to find. We used several of the songs in different fairy themed musical games. Dance of the Wild Faeries - the unsettling tension in this song was perfect for musical chairs.The music is both haunting and soothing. The girls couldn't help but sway and prance like Faeries in their dollar store wings. It successfully quieted 15 screaming 7 year old little girls on a sugar high (on multiple occasions). My daughter continues to listen to the songs when she's in a fairy or princess mood.It's also become a favorite lullabye cd. A wonderful treasure in her collection."
3,Disappointed,"I was hoping for more of an ethereal sound. The CD isn't bad, just not what I expected."
4,"Passion, Mystic, and great CD","A great CD filled with great songs, an angelic voice of Wendy Rule, and great overall music. What else would you ever need?I bought this CD several years ago and I still find it filled, from beginning to end, with great songs, one after another. Today a CD rarely comes out with so much in one CD. Maybe two or three songs on a CD actually are good or great songs. But not in this case, all songs are great.Listen to it for yourself and decide. It will be worth your while to listen and be convinced for yourself."
2,I Love The Hampsters But This Is Costy,"Ok, this may not be as costy as when you get it, but if I ordered it now, it would be alot of money. Now don't get me wrong I love the hampsters but this is just wrong.1) Hampsterdance song (radio edit) The most famous song of the hampsters, and the most commonly used version of it. Very cute, but you'll have trouble not getting hooked.2) Hampsterdance song (Extended Version) One of the longest of their remixes of this song, it's pretty much the same as the other one, but with a different intro.Overall, this isn't a very good deal because it donsn't have that many songs and all of them are practically the same. I would recommend one of the other hampster hits CDs. This is a good gift for collector of hampsterdance products, but if you're looking for more (and better) music, I think you should try one of their other CDs."
4,Good book,"This is a very good book for medicine students. I'm in the second year and has been very usefull. But this book dont justify changing your 5 edition on it. Almost all the chapters are equal, with just some boxes with clinical cases, and there is no answers to the questions of the end of the chapters, although the answers are clearly in the text, the old one, or at least the one that i saw in the library, had all the answers whith some complement to the text."
3,OF COURSE THERE ARE DEFECTS,"Reading Murrays Microbiology prooved to be harder than i thoughtI will focus my review in one ""setback"" because the previous reviewers seem to eagerly praised all the good points :Of course the how-do-diseases-look-like pictures are extremly helpful but there are only few of them .On the top of that there is the total absence of illustrations for visual learning(so visual learners stay away!)The very plus of this book is the summary boxes.Microbiology is a tough field with millions os info a student needs to know.At least that way the writters point out the basic that definately must be learned first.Otherwise it may be very easily to get lost in tones of information.Furthermore i would like to mention the fine artwork and especially the front cover.It may sound dump but its a ""psycological triggering"".It worked for me!"
5,Excellent,"This product arrived in perfect timing. It was exactly as the sender said it would be with no marks, etc. It was in great conditions and Ive been using since"
3,Strong filter but LOUD,I've taken to running it at night only. Keeps my golfish 50 gallon pretty clean just running 12 hrs/day.NOT quiet though.
4,Huh?! What?!?! Speak up!!,"Talk loud cause I'm standing near my new Whisper filter. All kidding aside, it kicks butt it's just loud. Really loud. I spent the first few days trying to figure out if there was something I could do to help quiet it down. No luck. But the filter works really well. I really circulates water very well.It's an excellent filter, but it's not a quiet filter."
3,The name whisper needs to be rethought!,"This filter seems to do what it is supposed to do fairly well, which is filter! But it does make a fairly audible whirring noise. I have it sitting right next to a marineland penguin, which is supposed to also filter 330 gph. I notice the penguin creates more water movement on the top of the water(desired) and the only noise I hear from it is the water flowing in. (also desired) Overall I probably would not recommend it. If you need to save $$$$ and don't mind a little noise then this one will do the job for you. I would suggest going with the marineland a little more $$ but worth it. I intend to order a marineland soon and save this one just for a backup."
2,not happy,i was happy when i 1st startd using this but about 8months to a yr later it stopped working. i contecetd seller who never responded back to me then i read the back of the whisper book and it said to send product to the company w 5.00 for return shipping. well they sent back my 5.00 and kept my filter. no note saying they were going to fix it or not. i would not buy this product from the seller that sold it to me then again i wouldnt by it at all because all of my fish have died and im out the money i spent on the filter plus shipping cost to send it 2 company to be fixed
2,"Loud, loud, loud","I would love to give this filter a higher rating. I will not make any comments about the effectiveness of this filter since I did not have it long enough to see how well it keeps my aquarium clean. However, after running it for 4 days, I had to do something different. My aquarium sits in my front room and the noise of this filter was simply unbearable. In the end, the filter's name was a complete contradiction. I ended up going with a Fluval 406 upon installation alone, I am MUCH more satified. There is a very, VERY slight humming noise, but not really noticable.The Tetra Whisper Power filter may be inexpensive, but just remember that sometimes, you really do get what you pay for!"
5,Great Filter!,I love this filter; I got this as a second filter to put on my 55 gallon tank and it works great! Would definitely recommend!
3,A Little too Loud!!,"I replaced my real old filter which was amazingly quiet with this new one. It seems to work great but just a bit too loud. My tank is on the second level in the living room so the noise does not bother me at all. I will use the noise to my advantage. My old filter was so quiet that I could not know if it wasn't working or had stopped unless I walked to the tank. Now when this one stops, I will know immediately that something is wrong. From what I have noticed, If you have an aquarium in an area where you need some quiet, this is not for you."
2,Works but sucked up my fish,"I've been using this filter for about 6 months. I got it with a tank that I bought used. It seems to be a decent filter for my 55 gallon tank, but I like having lots of small fish (from tetras to swordtails) and it sucked up dozens of them. Needless to say all of the fish and about 5 frogs were killed. I tried making a screen for the intake with both fabric and metal, but they got really messy and I gave up. I also tried adjusting the flow to a very low setting, but then my tank didn't get clean enough. I'm currently looking for a different filter with a built in screen."
5,"Solid filter, reliable performance","For the price, you probably can't find a better filter. I have used whisper filters for years, and they have more been very reliable. Whisper PF 60 is priced at 27 dollars, while competitors of the same class are at least 10 dollars more expensive. It does make a low, humming noise. So if you absolutely cannot tolerate any noise, this filter is not for you. The water level of your tank also needs to be couple inches above the motor in order for it to work properly, otherwise the filter will start sounding like a lawnmower. If you have small fish be aware of the filter intake sucking them in, since this filter easily pumps out 300+ gallon per hour. To avoid that, you can get some pre-filter sponge and just simply put it over the intake. Overall, a very nice filter."
2,Effective but LOUD,"Although this filter is very effective at keeping my tank clean, it is NOISY. My previous filter was essentially silent, while this one is audible in other rooms. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who values a quiet tank."
2,Loud and Inconsistent,"Honestly I'm rarely sure why I keep this filter.I purchased it as a secondary filter for my 55g to supplement my fluval. This thing is very loud and stops often. I often find myself taking it apart so that I can attempt to get it silent. Interestingly enough, the 30g version of this filter is really quite."
2,Nothing Whisper about it.,"I purchased 2 of these. I have 2 75 gallon tanks. I wanted to add these along with my Marineland Penguin 350. They are very noisy. Spend the few extra bucks and go with the Marineland. If you don't want the bio wheel, leave it out. I should have spent the extra few bucks and went with all 350's. I tried everything to quiet them down. They are just loud and obnoxious. But, if loud means nothing to you, the large bio bags they come with are really nice. It allows you to remove the charcoal media and either insert something else or leave it out. It also comes with extra pieces of down tube to reach the bottom of those tall tanks. If it was quiet, 5 stars. But the noise kills it for me."
3,Disappointed at first...,"Well at first when I hot the filter there was a giant leak in it, because apparently on the assembly line they used the wrong o rings. They will replace it if it's broken, I fixed mine myself with putty tape and it works beautiful. I have owned these filters before, about 6 of them different types from terra, and they all still work, first time tetra has done me wrong, but I'm still sticking with them. Especially for the price."
1,MISLED - RIPPED OFF & NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT,"I was completely stunned by the stock compression aid that I was sent. It was NOT the one depicted in the photograph.First of all, it came with a sticker that read something like ""this product cannot be returned for any reason -- even if theplastic bag enclosing it is intact and the product is unopened."" That was a paraphrase. I have purchased literally hundreds of products (mostly books) on Amazon and pay a fee for the annual free shipping, like a ""Prime"" user or something. I'll stick with Amazon but I want to warn you about this vendor."
5,Simply Inspiring!,"Leeza uses her own personal stories to showcase her scrapbooking layouts. Her ""idea starters"" are terrific for stimulating our thoughts for journaling. The large colorful layouts allow us to read Leeza's personal narrative. Scrapbooking 101 sections summarize different issues important to the novice scrapbooker. Leeza's simple but beautiful layouts inspire us to honor our time with others."
4,mistake in the description of product,"""Jaco's short 26 year life..."" Jaco's life was indeed short, but he was 35 when he died. Born 1951, died 1987."
4,"JAAAAAACO! (the last lyric from Victor Bailey's cover of ""Continuum"")",For the first-time Jaco listener. Any Jaco-phile worth his or her salt should have the albums these tracks were taken from.
5,killer bass,"this is must have collection , most of the stuff here is going to make you explore other artists-there is a good collection of stuff with others like herbie hancock, joni mitchell and pat metheny-not a bad or unintersting cut here"
5,Cure For digestive Woes,"When I was in sixth grade, I had a terible case of food poinsoing. Since that time, my digestive system has been super sensitive. These activated charcoal capsules are amazing. Taken at the first sign of upset, the charcoal binds any toxins and draws them out. They work quickly and have no side effects. Follow up with a few tablespoons of yougurt, and you're as good as new.I read that hospitals use activated charcoal in overdose cases. Don't know if that is true, but I do know that these capsules are safe and effective. If you are on medication or take vitamins or supplements, time hyour dosage so that you don't take them with these capsules since the charcoal will draw out the medicine.It is nice to know that there is a remdy for digestive distress that is natural, safe, easy, inexpensive and effective. I always have a bottle on hand."
4,It works.,"This is good when you are having temporary stomach problems. Charcoal is a natural sponge. It absorbs toxins and other harmful substances. If you are gassy, try it and you may find that it works for you. Be aware that it also absorbs..., meaning reduce the effects of other drugs if you are on medication.If it also happen that you are the type of person who can clear the room with your flatulence, a couple of these capsules can do some miracles. Not that it will turn your chimney into an air freshener, but at least neutralize it. Don't ask me for the proof, I...just heard about it.Disclaimer: Always consult your doctor first before taking any health products."
1,It has gelatin,I wish it were mentioned in the description that it contains gelatin. Now I have a bottle of product I cannot use and the return process is difficult and cumbersome. Just get it from your local health store
1,Not Vegan,"I bought this product for a vegan friend. When it arrived, the bottle states that the capsules are made of gelatin, which of course is made from animal skin and bones. The on-line description says nothing about this. So be warned, if you are trying to eat only plants, you may want to skip buying this product. Alternatively, you can try eating the charcoal contents of the capsule without the capsule itself. Good luck getting that down."
1,Not a stool stabilizer; did not reduce gas,"Nature's Way Activated Charcoal is not marketed as a stool stabilizer for those suffering from IBS. Nor is it marketed as a treatment for gas. However, so many people have stated that it has worked wonders for IBS sufferers and have given it 5 stars, that I countered with 1 star because it definitely did not help me, even in the slightest. I do not recommend this product for treating the symptoms of IBS."
4,Pretty good stuff,I use it when needed to assist with gut help; also use it once or twice a week for teeth whitening. So far so good.
3,Smaller than it seems.,"I got this for my chinchillas. It came in an ugly, nasty baby-barf green color (ew) and is a little bit bigger than the size of my smallest chinchilla. Would recommend for rats or animals of the like. Not for guinea pigs & up.It seems to be made well, and makes a nice crinkly sound when touched.3/5"
2,straps were chewed off in less than 24hrs!!!,I had high hopes for this. I have 2 female rats and when I saw this on Amazon I thought it looked perfect for them. After receiving it and examining it --it did look pretty sturdy and made well. I put it in their cage and right away they both went right in it. By the next morning though it was laying on the bottom of the cage with both straps chewed completely off. I couldn't believe the rats did that. They like to chew but I thought the nylon straps looked pretty strong. Oh well--back to looking!
4,"Rats enjoy it, but...","My 2 female rats really enjoyed sleeping in this hammock. At first they were wary of it and had to test it out a few times before it became their permanent home, but eventually they learned to love it.The problem I had was that the rats ripped the inside to shreds and ate right through the thing. They pulled all of it's guts out and spread it all over their cage in an act of defiance or something. They continued to use it after, but I was dismayed with how easily they were able to rip it apart. And yes, I do have plenty of things in their cage for them to chew it.Overall, it was nice while it lasted, but it's short life span has caused me to have to reorder one after only a month. It's a good thing that they are really cheap so it's not that big of a deal."
2,eh,"It was ok for temporary use. I find it better to find sleeper from smaller websites that have the metal links, not just fabric like this one, so it isn't chewed to pieces by pets. The straps were chewed to bits and made the sleeper useless. I won't buy this again."
2,Not a good item for chinchillas,"It is not double sided with fleece, I don't want my chinchillas eating nylon. Not a good item, I broke it apart, and tool the fleece out and added it to my own stuff and made a real tunnel, going to try to post a picture."
2,Did not last,"Not sure if it was just my guy or poor quality, but had the inside fur ripping up in a few days. Great idea, but had to throw it away."
2,Not the same product...,"The item description says Double Fleece. The item I received has vinyl on the inside, not fleece. Looks like I may be returning."
1,Little by Little !,"I ordered this book and read most of it in the hope that I would learn something about Familiars . In the interval between ordering and receiving my sixth sense made me begin to have doubts about Ms Little . Had she flown about the battlements of an old castle in the form of an Owl? Had she entertained A Hyrax or a Feral Cat as a house guest ? Had she ever had a pet Bat living behind a picture in the living room ? Was she acquainted with the properties of Henbane and twylight sleep and did she number Hecate among her close friends? The kindest thing , I thought was to suggest that Ms Little Knew as much about Familiars as I know about Conveyancing or Futures Trading , and let it go at that !"
2,lalayai,"I got these stars for my 18months old daughter. she was happy to see them but the dont glow much. they are very dim, infact very little. Its a disappointment for me but the baby is happy to see them during the day."
2,not that great,"When I bought it, I was pretty excited, but for the price the number of stars are too less. I don't think its worth buying this item."
4,Lights up at night.,"I bought this for my son, he installed it on the ceiling. They do glow at night and it seems you can stare at them all night. I will purchase more for my entertainment room."
3,Not as bright,"The colored stars are not as bright. They look better with the lights on, but don't glow as well in the dark."
4,glor in the dark stars,"The glue that was in this package...is not the best. Also, the stars, for some reason no matter how much light they receive do not shine as bright as I would had expected."
3,NOT IMPRESS,"IF I HAD THOUGHT OF IT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN SOME DISCO DUST GLUE THEM SUCKERS TO A PLAIN PLASTIC AND GLUE THE PLASTIC TO MY DAUGHTERS CEILING, WALLAH, LIKE DIAMONDS THESE SUCKER SHOULD GLITTER, JUST NOT IMPRESS, JUST NOT IMPRESS EVERY TIME I LOOK UP IT MAKES ME [...] DEPRESS."
2,Don't glow much at all,"I am so glad we didn't stick these stars on the ceiling. They hardly glow at all. Instead we cut out a large star shape out of cardboard, painted it and then affixed the stars to that. Don't bother putting them on the wall."
3,Very little glow,"I brought these stars expecting they would have enough glow, but they dont glow much especially the color once. The rating 3 is because, the colored once looks good during the day."
1,Pretty colors but they don't glow,"I bought these for my kids at Christmas. At first glance I thought the colors were great. However, once I got them on the ceiling my kids and I were very disappointed that these don't glow. The day after I gave these to my kids they ended up getting another brand of these stars from their grandparents. Those stars, unlike these, actually worked well. Very disappointed with purchase."
2,Colors not glow well in night,"Has colorful stars, but those colors are good in daylight at night you can hardly observe them, so set of above two is a best bet"
4,great quality,This item seems to be very high quality. I wish the angle of the end that attaches to the shower head would have bent downwards just a little more. I love not having to duck under the shower head anymore. Very good product and good price.
4,does the trick,"Does exactly what it says. I was even surprised to see they had some Teflon tape in the package(I fought with it awhile then used my own)As other reviews noted, the angle leaves the shower head a little high but most shower heads can pivot. So, no problem."
5,Gave the shower head the angle that was needed,I had some problems getting to the existing pipe but thankfully for the flange I was able to cover up the gap.
4,Shower arm increases the shower head height,"I like how the S shower arm increases the height of the shower head to a more comfortable height for a 6 foot tall person.The S could be slightly more curved so the water does not spray so far toward the back ofthe bath tub .But it is still very useful,much less expensive than redoing the plumbing.Easy to install."
4,Good quality but make sure the angle will work for your shower,"For my shower, the angle this left my showerhead was too shallow. I ended up buying a 45-degree connector to compensate."
2,Refinement Needed,"Construction is good, the escutcheon could be deeper, but the main issues with this shower arm are two fold, first, the length of the shower arm before the 90 degree bend is shorter than one would desire, so if your shower is a true mud shower, with a deep hookup, you're going to have to get a short extension piece to get it to hook up, second, and most problematic is the angle of the shower arm, which in a 36"" shower, will leave the water hitting towards the bottom of the wall at best, there is no chance with even the best swivel head to clean off the floor of the shower with the spray. I uninstalled this shower arm after one use."
4,Good for tall people,My boyfriend is 6'8 and I've listened to his daily gripes for 12+ years about how short shower heads are. I finally bought this for him and he loves it. Now he is happy with his shower and I'm happy that I no longer have to hear complaints. Ahhhhhhhh.........
4,Great Quality **NOTE -- Angle is higher than normal --**,"The Shower Arm is Great Quality Heavy Duty Brass with Chrome finish! It does exactly what it claims, raises the height by 6 inches...BUTIT FAILS TO MENTION A VERY IMPORTANT FACT... (reason for 4 stars)the Angle Is Higher than traditional shower arms. Instead of your water ""hitting somewhat"" near the wall with the controls at the lowest angle possible, it now hits in the CENTER of the tub, leaving no room for sudsing, etc.Also, if your shower head has a wide spray, the extra height will make the spread much wider and less effective.In the end, I took it off after one shower realizing tilting my head a little is well worth it."
3,Shower are extender,"I was not able to use this item as it was difficult to install. Required a plumber to install in my home, so i passed on it."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in this cd, especially since I was really looking forward to it. Queensryche is one of my favorite bands, even though most of their quality stuff is in the 80's and the rest is...lackluster. When I heard that they were going to be releasing a live cd of both Mindcrime albums, I was really pumped, especially since Mindcrime 2 is their best album since Promised Land. However, the sound is terrible. There is no energy. The Mindcrime performance on Operation:Livecrime is much better. Better sound, better production and much more interesting to listen to. Geoff Tate's voice is not as strong as it used to be and there is a lot of straining heard here. I am glad I did not pay full price for this cd. You should not, either."
2,A good soundtrack to a phemonal film,This is the soundtrack to the theatrical production of the DVD release of Mindcrime At The Moore. The sound quality is decent. The reason why I only give this album 2 stars is because there are parts of this recording that only makes sense if you are watching the DVD. People who own the DVD know what I'm talking about.Only buy this album if you want to complete your Operation Mindcrime collection (just as I did) or if your a die hard Queensryche fan (which I'm not.)
3,rogers' and hammerstein collection,"It'a good collection, but I thought it was the Lesley Ann Warren Cinderella, so that was a little disappointing. It's in great shape."
3,Loudness does the '70's,"With On the Prowl in '91, their last album with Hollywood gutter-boy Mike Vescera, Loudness went retro with re-recorded tunes from the early days and hard-rockin' blues a la AC/DC. With their self-titled album from '92 they ""progressed"" to a more progressive '70's feel in the vein of Bill Steer's Firebird or Michael Amott's Spiritual Beggars. Better than you might think."
2,not so warm,"I was skeptical when I got this bag b/c there was no loft. I'm guessing it was probably packed in the stuff sack for over a yr at Amazon since the tag said it was made in 2006. Anyways, I got it in the summer and I was definitely sweating in it in Sept but I tried using it in my basement apt recently and though it was about 50 degrees, I was freezing. I ended up trying my fleece liner and that by itself was warmer than this bag."
3,bush wacked,There was no specified bed size it just asked if this would fit a chevy silverado so i received a set that fits a 8 foot bed not a 6 1/2 foot bed oh well get out the roto zip
4,Well acted indie,"I read about this film on a camcorder website years ago. Apparently this was shot on a Sony Z1U or one of those early Sony HDV cameras. When I saw it on Amazon, I bought it immediately. This is one of the very few places you can see the film.I was very happy with my purchase. The film looks fantastic for HDV, really blew me away how great the image quality was. The filmmakers are top notch and they made a wonderful film."
5,Esbilac 2nd Step,I ordered Esbilac 2nd step to supplement my (6) puppies feeding and to begin the weaning process off the mother. The pups enjoyed the Esbilac. It was easy to prepare (I used water) and I could warm it easily.
3,"OK beginner and Dean is great, but...","Why not step up to Dean Edge 10a with active electronics?! You will get two pick-ups and way more tone options for $149!!! The 09 is ok for a throw in the trunk type bass but for a few bucks more you can get so much more. BTW, my son has a black 09 and a black 10a so we have played/heard both side by side. To put it in perspective we bought a beater 09 of CL for $25 and are in the process of defretting it as a first time experiment. The 09 is a great candidate for something like that where a mistake won't hurt too bad. You should be able to pick up a black 09 for around $100 new. Maybe the natural look is worth the extra to you."
4,"Great Bass for the money. Looks good, feels better.",Highly recommend for beginers or a second standby ax for more advanced players. You cant go wrong. Go for it!!!
5,Looney Tunes,These dvds brought me back to my childhood and Saturday mornings. I watch these with my 7 yr old son. He loves them. They don't make cartoons like this anymore.
3,Looney Tunes Spotlight Colection Volume 5,If your buying the looney Tunes Spotlight Collection Volume 5 your really missing out. The Spotlight Collection only has the Bugs and Daffy and the Fairy Tales Disc. The Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 5 has an entire disc devoted to Bob Clampett and an entire disc of black and white cartoons including the two discs that are included in the Spotlight Collection.
2,Could have been so much better,"I've bought either the Spotlight or Golden collections right along and noticed the quality going down each year and this last volume is the thinnest yet. You know Warner Brothers Co is dragging this series out so they can max out their profits, but this is an exceptionally weak line up when you consider the library they can draw from.I know if the next installment isn't any better I'm cutting things off here. If you haven't bought this yet - take a closer look at what's in here and you may pass. I know I should have."
1,"go back and listen to 1,2,fairwarning diver down,1984,women&","Van Halen 3 is not a worthwhile lp. it sounded as though there were three guys in the studio at different times, different planets! who are these people? the other guy-singer-should have stayed home and watched hee haw reruns.yuck!"
1,"Pure Crap. I can't, unfortunately give it a lower rating","If this is the best Eddie can do sober, Good God man, get some booze into your body. This CD is just awful. I am beginning to suspect that Eddie has used up his bag full of tricks, which is why he has to rely more on gimmics like the power drill on ""Carnal Knowlege,"" and the Sitar Effect Box ""VH III"". In his solo on the live album he repeated a phrase from ""Spanish Fly"" no fewer than six times. If he has creatively run out of gas, he should have the class to call it quits. The Dave years were good mean rock. The Sammy were definately more Top 40ish, but this new stuff is unredeemable. Van Halen RIP."
1,Van Halen?,"When I first heard the album, I thought I was missing something. So ...another listen. OK, maybe this is VH's Zeppelin III. Another listen... No, this really sucks. It's not a hidden masterpiece. It's a lame attempt to bilk another million dollars (???) from the faithful. Well, no more blind buys for me. I'll have to hear the next album before I buy. Come on Eddie...I'm tired of defending you...get with it!!!"
1,Where are the songs ?,"I'm not too bothered about whether Gary is better than either Sammy or Dave. What struck me is that there were no songs here. Since Eddie co-produced, it appears noone else had the strength or will to tell him was good and what was crap. I'm afraid this is well and truly the beginning of the end for VH. I'm really sorry I bought this CD."
1,They shouldn't even be called Van Halen anymore!,"I bought this CD because I really like all of Van Halen's music. I was very disappointed! It all sounded the same and it seemed slow and depressing compared to their previous albums. I liked Sammy, but I think they should bring Diamond Dave back and make another album. I feel I wasted my $14 and the CD sits in the case on the shelf. I wish I could send it back to them and make them pay me back!! I definitely don't recommend buying this one. Listen to it first if you can."
2,Van Halen's worst CD to date!!!,"There is very little that I can say that is good about this CD. I bought it thinking to myself ""it's Van Halen, it should be good even without Sammy Hagar"". Boy was I ever wrong! In fact I am really suprised the band went on to record this CD with this lead vocalist. The band surely could have found a better lead vocalist than this guy. I was extremely disappointed with this CD. Do yourself a big favor and save your money for something better."
3,Not Bad,"Van Halen's 3rd incarnation gives some good results.1. From Afar - Great music and lyrics, a bit Queenish2. Once - A beautiful song, slighty cliche lyrics but well done3. How Many Say I - Great, it's finally good to hear Eddie break from the party imageThe music is good, the problem with this album lay in its timing. Cherone at the time was overcoming a throat problem and was not at his top. Anyone should agree to this who saw them live after the albums release.Whether Van Halen will continue on at this point will have to be seen"
3,Not nearly as bad...,"VH3 is not nearly as bad as many say it is. Cherone takes a back seat on his debut and lets Eddie take over. So while it doesn't contain a stellar track like 'Jump' or 'Right Now,' there's no bomb like 'Amsterdam' either! I mean, How Many Say I is poorly done, but at least it's a good song to have a laugh to."
2,THIS IS SAD,"It is really very sad to hear such an album from Van Halen. I think they are one of the best hard rock bands ever, but this album is very dissapointing. There is one thing I want to say to Eddie and Alex; ""Please take David Lee Roth back to the band"""
2,Still not sure,"There are moment's were I would like Gary Cherone but not very many..... Even Eddie did'nt do it for me on every song and he alway's has before. This record makes me feel sad, very dark album. Where are all the boogie tune's HELP EDWARD!!!!!"
2,Gary Cherone needs to explore his less thoughtful side.,"I certainly believe VH can can be great again with Gary Cherone, but they have to lose the rather saturnine mood of the III album if this is to happen. When you think of VH music, you think of care-free love and hot cars, not morbid days and cold wars--that's the bottom line!"
2,"No offense, Gary...BRING SAMMY BACK!!!","I don't think Gary Cherone is to blame for the failure of VHIII. It's the loss of Sammy Hagar. No, I'm not one of those ""immature"" VH fans who boycotted the new disk. I bought it the day it came out, and I still own it. But, it severely lacks the 'musical fullness' we experienced when the ""Red Rocker"" was still on vox. Hagar was a great writer as well as singer and musician. I don't think Cherone took part in a whole lot of writing on the new CD. Gary is a great singer, but that's all he is. Sammy was a great singer, guitar player, AND writer; a more well-rounded asset to the band. I listened to 'Balance' the other day and wanted to cry. You can clearly hear the difference. I am excited for the next release. Hopefully it will be a case of freshman jitters and sophmore success. I wish VH the best of luck. One star? Maybe not. But, most definitely not five."
2,One to forget,"Comparing to the the other VH's CDs I got, this is the worse ot then. I don't know if it's because of the new singer or something else, the true is: They need better Songs. Buy this CD just if you are a dye-hard fan."
1,Swallow your pride guys and get Sammy back,"I was keen to hear VH MkIII and wondered how Sammy could ever be topped. After one listen, I didn't think I would ever play it again! Gary Cherone's vocals are very different to Dave or Sammy. It seems they've changed their writing style to accomodate this. And it just doesn't work. Cherone's voice really grates. The album grows on you after a few plays (Tracks 2, 3 and 4 are reasonable), but it is a very ordinary album. VH Mk III is doomed. Swallow your pride and get Sammy back."
1,Why Can't This Be Van Halen?,"I have been into Van Halen since VHI! I loved Dave with the band and I love Sammy with the band. Gary's vocals just get on my nerves!! This is the first VH CD I have not played like 50 million times. I played it once, was shocked! I played it again, I just wanted to lose my lunch. SO on my CD rack it sits. All I can say is WHY?"
1,Cow Dung at its Worst,"What a piece of garbage this is. Of the the 700 CD's I own, this is the absolute worst. Eddie owes me fifteen bucks. I really liked Gary with Extreme, but he was not a real party guy. Van Halen music (when at its best) was always upbeat, have a blast, party music. You could hear the fun the group was having, regardless of what Eddie has said in print about David Lee and Sammy. Eddie is not going to pull a Carlos Santana at this rate. His work has gotten worse and worse since ""1984"", and most of the stuff since David Lee left sounds forced and unrealistic. The early stuff sounded like they didn't have a care in the world - just loved making music. Eddie's read too many of his clippings about being a guitar God. Although Stevie Ray Vaughan died early, he could teach Eddie a thing or two about being dedicated to the music, not his own conceited ego. Eric Clapton this guy will never be. After risking money on this guys last 7 CD's, I will not be suckered again."
2,"""Different Direction"" or not, this album reaks","I liked this album at first because I really wanted to like it. But upon recent re-listening, I have found that not only is this album a disappointment for VH standards, it's a pretty lousy album by ANY standard. The only songs with any long-lasting appeal are ""Josephina"" and ""Once,"" possibly ""From Afar."" The opening riff to ""Fire In The Hole"" is reminiscent of older VH, but by the time the chorus kicks in it's pretty much downhill. And I don't know WHAT they were thinking releasing ""Without You"" as the first single, when it's probably one of the three worst songs on the album. Everything on this album is lacking, including the production. Overall an utterly boring album."
3,Not as bad as some people think,"This wasn't that bad of an album. It was in my opinion the worst Van Halen Albums. I hate Gary Cherone and i think his lead singing for this sucks. Most of the songs on it don't have that Van Halen sound to it. Eddie doesn't do his crazy guitar riffs and some of the songs are only piano. It is only worth getting to hear ""Fire in the Hole"", ""Without You"", ""Dirty Water Dog"" and the new sound of VH. If i could i would give this album 2 1/2. This wasn't to bad but had it's DOWNSIDE!!!!"
3,Drums lack energy because of bad production,"I've been a huge Van Halen fan, so I believe I gave this album a fair chance. I accept Gary's inclusion in the band, and his singing ability fits the music well enough. My gripes are, for one thing, the lyrics; although Van Halen has never impressed me with their lyrics, the words from V3 are laughable. ""Ballot or the Bullet?"" please. Furthermore, the production value is simply inadequate. While Ed's guitar still sounds great, Alex's drums don't have the power, the pulverizing yet fluid rhythms, that made the other albums so energetic. This problem, alone, undermines the power of the music entirely. It's so unfortunate that a fair album was marred by poor production. I do have faith, however, that future albums could be great. Hopefully the band won't rush things this time; another mistake like this could be too costly to recover from."
1,Was Me Wise Magic the last of their magic?,"Was Gary on a Karaoke machine? He sounds like he's singing at the music rather than with it. It comes across way to busy...The ""effect"" ruins some promising tracks like Fire in the Hole and Ballot or the Bullet."
1,New singer relaced because he SOUNDS like Sammy.,"The new VH singer has one speed: pained, scratch-the-blackboard-with-your-nails alto. It is unfortunate that VH wants the same good music that they enoyed with Sammy by replacing someone who sounds like him. The fact is that Sammy CAN sing. His inflection in his voice makes you want to sing along.The new singer, however, CANNOT sing.VH has no concern, according to Eddie, if they sell CD's or not. I don't care if Sammy wanted his own dressing room, or if Eddie kicked him out because he was not a 'team player'; VH should take a lesson from Roth and understand it is up to the fans to say if they should play another note.I am a VH fan and hope that I will not live 'with out you'. Call Sammy and fly 'higher and higher straight up you'll climb."
2,Curious about this CD,"CD came in great shape and was a real value. I was curious about this CD that was described as a train-wreck. It is far from anything that VH has done in the past. The music is OK, but know that it is not a rockin' VH album."
1,Can it really be that bad? Yep.,"Poor production values, toxic vocals. This album would be an embarrassment for a garage band, let alone a band with VH's talents."
4,A Good Album that got overlooked,"VHIII is actually a really good album! I bought it when it first came out and i thought to myself how in the hell can u follow up Hagar and Roth? Well the answer is Gary Cherone.I know alot of fans downplay this as not a good album or an addition to the VH Catalog but you may want to give it a second listen.""Without You"" was the radio hit off this and it plays perfectly into the Classic Halen Songs in my opinion.I dont think radio or fans stood behind this enough and i understand its Extremely (no pun intended) hard to follow up the 2 Legends but i always perferred Hagar over Roth myself yet this has some really sweet guitar laced rock jams.""One I Want"" has a cool groove and ""From Afar"" is a haunting melody courtesy of Mr Cherone.I wish they would have made a follow up to this just to see where they could have taken it.""Fire in the Hole"" is a heavier track that was featured in the Lethal Weapon 4 movie and i dig that one too."
4,Not a bad album at all.,"I have just listened to Van Halen III after a ten year hiatus, and I have to admit that I really enjoyed it! I don't think it deserves the bad reviews that it has gotten over the years, and definitely deserves another listen to those who wrote it off. I consider myself a Van Halen fan, usually the DLR years, and I do agree that this album is considerably different from the rest, but I can appreciate the experimental feel which it exhibits. It is most certainly NOT the worst album ever made as other posts have stated. I think Gary Cherone vocals are good, although they do sound similar to Sammy Hagar at times. As a matter of fact, I am inclined to give Extreme a listen to hear more of his work."
1,"Ted Templeman, HELP!!!!!!!!","it's been well over a year since I bought this thing. tried again to listen, but sorry, it still [is bad]. this is the worst van halen album, and the future looks mighty dim. to all of those who reviewed this, and liked it, i say ""I don't understand."" there is almost nothing good here. the lyrics are bombastic. must have spent a lot of time with a thesarus. obviously, the band must realize this because they played atlantic city last year. is vegas next? ted templeman help!!!!! vh's best albums are those with ted at the helm. maybe he can straighten this mess out. otherwise, bye bye warner bros, and hello k-tel records. july 1999 and i still can not believe how bad this cd was and still is. maybe i'll try hanging it from my rear view mirror. maybe that will improve it. or maybe i'll nuke it. lead guitarist disease. red voodoo rocks. buy that instead."
1,"This is, by far, the worst music VH has ever produced!","I have listened to this piece of Sh!# CD many times trying to understand what the FU*! Gary is doing in this band in the first place.The defining sounds of Van Halen have been silenced by a weak and shallow singer. Gary is not (and never will be), VH quality and should never have been considered for the position.The previous two singers, Sammy and David Lee have both moved on (and up), showing that the real power in the vocals for Van Halen came from these two great singers.It doesn't really matter who the singer is but, it does matter that the singer is as powerful as the music that Van Halen is capable of. Gary falls way short of this requirement and I feel sorry for the rest of the band."
1,Not to good :(,"It is sad that the band is trying to sound like Van Hagar, but the words are not there. The sound is not there. I will miss VH."
3,"Decent rock album, not Van Halen though.","I think this is a decent rock album if you consider it ""not really"" a Van Halen album. If you consider it a Van Halen cd then it's probably not that great, if this makes sense. It's pretty good but not great, especially compared to previous Van Halen albums."
3,It just ain't the same since Dave left.,"VH3 kinda grew on me, but only about 3 or 4 songs. I miss Dave"
1,A COMPLETE BOMB!,This was the biggest mistake of Van Halen's career. Gary Cherone is trying too hard to sound like Sammy Hagar. Van Halen's greedy manager lost it when he got Sammy kicked out of Van Halen so he could get a bigger percentage of the profits. Lets hope Eddie loses the EGO and lets a real frontman back in the band named....DAVID LEE ROTH!
1,AWFUL,"THis is the lowest-selling record ever by Van Halen. Simple as that. Of course the are some gems around that were never top sellers. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. This album didn't sell just because it's so bad."
1,DANGER-STAY AWAY,"This CD is full of negative energy-nothing to do with VH, Cherone doesn't sing, he screams. Almost all of the songs suck-there is an overall feeling of angst beneath the album. Eddie's guitar sounds like George Harrison (no offense, but this is the 21st century where is the brown sound???). If you, like me, loved VH then listen to Tropic of Capricorn from Sammy Hagar's 10-13 new CD. Then you'll see that Sammy is VH as we know them. VHIII is a curse-stay away. I hope I lose this CD again."
1,Terrible,"I paid a $1 for this CD. Bought it not knowing who the singer was......he sounded a little like Sammy to me. This CD pretty much is bad. I feel a little ripped off, even at the price paid. Nuff said!!"
1,Van Halen Should Have Sued Themselves For This One!,"Just total crap, from start to finish. It's got a slightly curious electronically manipulated guitar experiment from Eddie, and a couple faintly recognizable moments from that once dominant rhythm section, but mostly it's just totally lame. Ed can make extraordinary sounds at will, and Alex could be as monumental and heavy as an avalanche, but there's absolutely no inspiration driving 'em here. They're on auto-pilot as Sammy Hagar imitator Gary Cherone claws and scratches his way through leaden, dismal social consciousness and even more dismal heartaches. The joy of the original Van Halen was their remarkable harnessing of raw, molten energy into profoundly original rock songs. All these tunes on III are profoundly cliched duds. It's so bad, I'm sure it's committing a dozen crimes against nature."
1,THE TRUE DREAM WAS OVER IN 1984...BUT REVISITED IN 2007!!,"I'm so glad the true VAN HALEN lead singer DAVID LEE ROTH is back!!No more VAN HAGAR, The mighty VAN HALEN has waken up andbrought ROTH back for the final chapter!!DAVID LEE ROTH + VAN HALEN = THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDSI rate this CD a 1 of 5 stars!!"
1,Come back David or Sammy!,I was so dissapointed in this cd...I can't believe how much I disliked it. I never even heard it all the way through it's so bad. I think I tossed it out the window of my car. Oh well...don't make the same mistake I did...
1,Absoultely Horrible...,"Well where do I begin? How could they let this happen? The David Lee Roth era was classic, and the Sammy Hagar era was continuing a great tradition and making it better. The Gary Cherone era, which has now past, was a complete mistake. It reminds of one of those terrible jobs you leave off your resume. VHIII was just plan bad. Gary was a Sammy/Dave wanna be. Live he was worse. Eddie's guitar genius could not save this project from hitting bottom. Sure it sold over a million, but more than half were exchanged for something else. Take my advice don't walk away from this cd...RUN! Bring back Sammy..."
3,good album and a good singer(that didn't mix),"Let me start off by saying Vna Halen III is a very good CD, at least compared to anybody out there today, yet not so good when set against other VH albums. Cherone did what Eddie told him to do on this album and didn't sing like he did when he was with Extreme(check out III sides to every story). I am sorry that VH let him go, since they are once again without a singer. Us VH fans can only hope and prey that Sammy, Dave or both make a return and restore the MIGHTY VAN HALEN to the place in rock which they deserve. I guess we'll see soon enough since they are to be inducted into the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2003, maybe then they'll set aside their differences and make the great record all us fans know they can make."
4,better than what ya'll think,"Y'know what ?...maybe you VH fans should stop thinking about the band for a minute and actually listen to just the album. I mean c'mon, a band changes after time. Look at all the other great bands out there. there's always something taken away or added. this music is great. VH has broken new ground with ""once"" and ""how many say i"". And how can you you not like songs like ""without you"" or ""fire in the hole"" ? VH has changed for the time and I think they've changed for the better. They've matured and grown in music. and Eddie shall remain the greatest guitarist in my mind..."
1,Just a question,"At what point did Van Halen transform into complete dorks? This album is incredibly terrible for numerous reasons. First and foremost, we must start with Eddie Van Halen. At one time, this ego-driven ignoramus was hailed as a modern-day guitar-toting Rembrandt. Well guess what, he ain't so special anymore. His sanctimonious songwriting reeks of immaturity and idiocy. This CD, however, does have a purpose: it's a mighty fine coaster. While this album couldn't even elicit emotion out of a four-year-old on a sugar binge, it does prevent cold beverages from leaving rings on oak coffee tables. Trust me, I've tried it."
1,Click the 'BACK' button on your browser NOW!!!,"Run! Run away. Do NOT even think about this one. I'm mailing my copy of this CD directly to Eddie asking for my money back. If this Van Halen trend continues?? The next CD may feature numerous bassoon solos, with your neighbor on vocals. Change therapies Ed.....this ones broke. And I may be the biggest VH fan I've ever met. Yes--I paid more money to see the show 1 week after my purchase. Gone! Dave??????"
1,What was he thinking?,"Ok, the worst thing about this project is the songwriting. The lyrics are so whipped up, it proves that sammy was a better songwriter. Theres songs about going to the dentist (fire in the hole), and getting girls (dirty dog water) Not to mention the horrible how many say I, Eddie got too much control and showed just how goofy he really is. This is VH's much forgotten cd,"
1,OUCH!!!,"'Without You' is the only ""good"" song on this album. A couple of tracks approach ""decent"", and the rest are horrible. This album was a lesson in disaster and should be discarded in the nearest dumpster. Eddie needs to swallow his pride and move on. Gary Cherone was not his soulmate, and was a terrible pick for a lead singer. (So is Eddie as evidenced by 'How Many Say I?') Cherone tried to sound like Sammy, but failed miserably. I heard that Hagar was let go in part because of his work ethic. Sammy has since been working his butt off in the studio, releasing quality material, while Van Halen has stagnated. I haven't heard any info on Van Halen's status, but it appears they might be done for good. Too bad they didn't end on a good note.Avoid this at all cost."
1,Surprisingly Bad,"I recently listened to the ""III"" album and have finally understood what all the bad reviews were about. At first I just thought that people were just upset about having a new singer in the group and maybe they were Sammy Hagar or David Lee Roth fans who couldn't (or wouldn't) have an open mind towards the ex-""Extreme"" Singer, but now I realize that this is very much a terrible CD. I don't think that Cherone is completely to blame here, because the song lyrics and arrangements are pretty awful but it would have been better for VH to have at least hired a singer that didn't sound like a poor imitation of Hagar. Anyhow, that's all history now. If DLR doesn't work out in the reunion, may I suggest Joan Jett (for a change of pace) as the new lead singer or if a female won't cut it for longtime fans, how about Mike Patton (of Faith No More)?"
1,FUTILE EFFORT,"Eddie dropped the ball in this one. It is an arrogant album, which gave almost no liberty to Cherone sing in his own way, and the compositions are so bad, that Eddie should have reserved them for a solo album. It's a shame how band members Anthony and Alex didn't interfere, because I can't believe they liked the final result of Eddie's ideas for this album. But someone had to be the scape goat, and singer CHerone is gone for sure. Without doubt, the next CD will be better, because it is impossible to get worst than this one."
1,"Eddie says he wrote it on the toilet, and it's crap . . .","Okay, first understand, I am a HUGE Van Halen fan from the release of the first album. I am also a professional guitarist and spent many years copying Eddie and have one of his signature Wolfgang series guitars. I never liked Sammy Hagar, but he said he quit because Eddie just had riffs and boring ones at that and no songs for Van Halen III. Sammy says it all. This record is an embarassment to one of the greatest guitar players of all time. Eddie said in an interview that he composes on the toilet, I guess that is why this album is crap. So Eddie if you read these, please either get back with Roth and bring back the glory days or go and create and instrumental band and let yourself fly like you did on Fair Warning. So Fair Warning, stay away from this stinker."
2,Another cheating band strikes again,"Take the voice away and you have a sound track to ""Face Off"" If you cant get along or if you have diffrences, what do you do. Go out and find someone who sounds like you did 4 years ago. Rememeber The sounds alikes, they did Beatles songs and sold to unexpect consumers thinking they were getting something worth wild. The VH3 does the same. With no mistake that this isnt Sammy Hagar, your ears seam to stray off and hear the great ""old"" guitar riffs from Eddie. For the CD, if you liked 'For Unlawfull Carnial Knowledge' you wont be dissapointed with this CD. Just waiting for Mike Hutcheson to make a return to INXS. Via tape or a sound alike"
2,Dead ducks on the highway...,"I once had the misfortune of watching a woodland duck being run over by a large Lincoln Continental. The sound that issued forth from this poor, dying creature is strangely reminiscent of the garbled wailing coming from Cherone's gaping hole."
1,Somebody Get Me A Doctor!,"It was hard to imagine a worse singer than Sammy Hagar. His voice sucked and his lyrics were simplistic drivle. But leave it to Eddie Van Halen (not winning any prizes in the brains department himself) to come up with someone even worse. Gary Cherone is possibly the worse singer to ever hit a stage. His voice in it's screaming mode -- 99% of the record in this case --rarely changes pitch and breaks apart in a way that grinds on the ear. It's really hard to explain until you hear it yourself, but fortunately there are still samples above. ""From Afar"" and ""Fire In The Hole"" are the only tunes where the band clicks, and low points like ""Once"" and ""Ballot For The Bullet"" will have you writing this group off."
2,SAMMY/DAVID COME BACK!!!,"Only Eddie saves this cd from getting a lower rating. Put a fork in 'em, the band is done. Thanks for the memories, guys."
2,"Ed, you don't have to play a solo everytime!!!","This album has some great rhythms on it which is the true Eddie Van Halen comming out. Somewhere along the line, Ed starting feeling that he has to put a ""mind blowing"" solo in each song. Ed's solo's on this album are very intricate sounding but do nothing for the song and/or for the listener. What ever happened to the ""if it sounds good, then it is good"" way of thinking? I guess this is what happens when guitar players start producing their own albums. Bands need someone to tell them when a song is crap and when a song is good enough to go on an album. Most of these songs are crap. The fans want and deserve more Ed,come on, come over to this side for the big win. Sammy and Dave are laughing at you!!!!!!"
2,"Decent lyrics, s**tty guitars","Ok, not all is lost, for these guys. Gary Cherone isn't that bad of a vocalist, and will do in this case, for Van Halen. What I'm wondering is, WHAT HAPPENED TO EDDIE???!! There isn't one decent solo in this cd. Just a lot of feedback. I think, that they should keep Gary, but Eddie, put the power back into your playing. Also, the production of this CD was pretty bad, too, which isn't their fault. But Gary can rock, if you've seen him live, you will know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. Old fans shouldn't worry, because their next disc should be WORLDS better than this. Van Halen has learned a lesson, and will move on, to do what they've always done. ROCK!!!"
2,Adjusting to changes,"I feel this album was not their best work but it had some very strong points. Some of the songs are excellent while some seem to lack. One thing is for sure and that's that the album is very different from their other music. However, it has some good originality in it. I believe that Once is truly a beautiful song with great lyrics. Other strong songs are Without You with New World, Josephina and A Year to the Day. I think there is some genius in a lot of the music, I just don't believe it is a very well finished album. I think they messed around too much with effects on the vocals and sometimes they had a good thing going and messed it up with other parts of the song. It's not full of the catchy pop tunes that they once had. It lacks a little of that happy go lucky stuff that Van Halen fans have always loved. But it also has some very good stuff. I think they can do better."
2,"It's not bad, but...","I was huge fan of Extreme, also of ""Hager's VH"", went to their shows when I lived in Japan. So, my expectation for this material was very high enough. Well, it's not bad, but..I should wait for another one, 'til things really settled. 'Til then, I will cherish my memories."
2,"Because it's Van Halen, two stars...","...but otherwise a terrible album. Being a huge VH and Extreme fan, I was extremely disappointed with Gary Cherone's vocals here. I thought that his voice, along with Eddie's blazing guitars that it would be great, but boy was I wrong.Let's be serious, people. If you are going to own one Van Halen album, I can guarantee you 1998's 'Van Halen III' will not be at the top of your list. 'Neworld,' an instrumental piece is the only halfway decent song on the album.Overall, this is a very poor album. Cherone's vocals are great with Extreme, but his vocal style just doesn't fit Van Halen.I can't recommend this release to anyone except collectors. A very disappointing release."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I had some actual expectations for this one, but my hopes were dashed. I absolutely hated every track on it.It sounded nothing at all like Van Halen. The guitar was all classical instead of the usual wicked licks that Eddie delivers. I forced myself to listen to the entire album because I paid a lot for it. I wanted to give up half way, but I made a point of it. I hated every single song. It was bland garbage. ""Me Wise Magic"" (with David Lee Roth) was better than any song on this album. Completely worthless from top to bottom. I expected a WHOLE lot more from Van Halen. What a disappointment. I haven't listened to it since.And yes, that really is Van Halen. Big fat suckfest of an album."
4,VH 3 is sansRoth and sansHager but still pretty good,"Pretty good. Eddie is still a great guitar player and Alex and Mike still rock out. ""From afar"" is probably not one their greatest songs but sounds like a good example of song writing experimentation. ""How many say I"" is a weirdsong. I keep hearing the piano chords to ""Right now,and 1984 in that song. Eddie sounds like Roger waters at beginning on ""H.M.S.I"". The best songs are ""Once, Fire in the hole, Dirty water Dog, One i want, without you, Primary, and Ballot or the bullet"". ""Year to the day"" is good but a bit too long. ""Neworld"" is alright. ""Josephina"" is too quiet compaired to the old (Roth/Hager)Van Halen. This CD did not sell as well as their other ones when it first came out, but it does have some good musicianship and songwriting."
4,Give'em A Break Damnit,"Hey, this band has in my opinon never been about the singers, even though the press and radio makes it seem that way. The band all about the musicianship and harmonies that Micheal, Eddie and Alex bestow upon us every couple of years.This album was ofcourse the only one with Gary Cherrone but as with Exterme he showed me at least that he is one of the best Rock-N-Roll singers out there and he didn't even begin to sing like I know he can. This album has a heavy infux of Micheal, both on bass and backing vocals. Alex is ofcourse the Driving force again and Eddie if not for the last song on which he sings is, well, his normal rockgod self.Someday this will be known as a classic album even though the press panned it. Hey the press panned Aerosmith for years and just how good have they turned out"
1,"Time to pack it in, guys","The music is unlistenable, and Cherone, who was better with his old band Extreme, comes off here like a Hagar clone. And Eddie, keep playing guitar and don't SING! By the way, Gary just quit VH so it's official: VH is history!"
1,this album is a van halen cover band,This is horrible...i am a huge VH fan and i hope they bring back the real force behind this group .. DAVID LEE ROTH!!!!!! If you like real VH then i suggest you pass on this one.
1,"How Many More Pieces of Crap, Say I??","No one is a bigger fan of VH than I. If Ed Van Halen thinks people are going to continue to fork out 16.99 to hear him experiment with crap in his solitary studio, then he is a jazz singer. Ed was my hero for years but no more is Ed cool! Every interview he gives is actualy repeated over and over and over just like his latest guitar solos on the last three albums. He hasn't changed the sound of his guitar for 10 years now, and I gotta tell you it's just nerve racking now. I wish he would stop pretending to be the second coming of Beethoven or something and just put out some damn Rock and Roll. What a shame. Sammys solo album and the new DLR make Ed look like he's still in re-hab. Don't even buy it!"
1,veloc@ronsm.com,"Van Halen, R. I. P.The Van Halens are formidable musicians, but have squandered their talent on this drivel. They have abandoned -- selfishly -- the best aspects of their music.David Lee Roth, on the other hand, has miracuously rejuvinated himself and his sound on his new album the DLR Band. He is now the embodient of the old, vintage, potent Van Halen.David Lee Roth, on the other hand"
1,Inconsistent recording. VH is scattered all other the place.,"I was pretty disappointed with VH 3. A great album is consistently, and VH3 is very inconsistent. One song rocks, the next is a ballad, the next is an experimental piece. What made early VH so great was that it was consistently great, guitar rock. Eddie is now all over the map."
3,Over Looked Gem,"First off let me say this... the first 4 VH albums are the best after that it's kind of hit and miss. I never cared much for the Hagar years. most people hate this album But it has some good stuff on it. I think Eddie's solo in The One I want is KILLER! Dirty Water Dog, Fire In The Hole, Both great songs. How many say I is useless filler but then again so was some of the stuff on the older albums Big Bad Bill, One Foot out the Door etc. The production sucks. thats the main problem here. I like having this Van Halen disc in my collection and while it is not their best It's not so bad that it need to be ignored Eddies playing is great as always."
2,too bad....could have been awesome:(,"Back when Gary was picked as the new lead singer, I was thrilled. He was an awesome singer with Extreme. Great showmanship.But when I heard this album, it sounded as though the band didn't even try. You can tell they were going for the ""raw"" 90's sound but the album sounds like it was produced in the garage of an amature. The songwriting is almost nonexistant. no hooks no melody. Please don't judge gary by this album. Listen to Extreme's music and you'll get a sense of the potential that was lost here."
3,"Underated in most books, solid van halen sound, not the best vocals and lyrics.","I picked up this collectors tin edition on sale at one of the local shops because it seemed neet. Contains a VH guitar pick and a book in a cool little tin. But, it didn't make up for the Vocal of Gary Cherone. Yes, he was good with Extreme, but just seemed rushed into Van Halen, and seems to have been forced to almost sound like Sammy. At times I thought I was listening to Sammy sing, but it just wasn't right, off tone many times. The lyrics seemed rushed. But, the band and music was solid van Halen, and could have been Great if done with Sammy. I do enjoy the song ""without you"", never did care for ""fire in the hole"", just a cheesy song. Anyhow, Good for a die hard Van Halen fan just for the music, but not like for the masses. I overall like it, its a good piece of history on how to self destruct a band and level a fan basis, but it is decent."
3,Not vintage Van Halen,"At first when you hear this cd you may not like it as I did. But being a diehard Halen fan I kept listening to it and it does rock with songs like Without You and Fire in the hole. Not the best album to date, and they need to go back to what made them great which is having the greatest guitar player ever!!!!! play a little more solos, and wouldn't it be great to see a world tour for 2000 with David Lee Roth!"
4,Van Halen Can Still Hack It!!,"This album may have been their best, but that doesn't mean they can't do better. It has good songs on it like ""One I Want"" and ""Fire Down Below."" I personaly think it was a good album!!!"
2,"go back and listen to 1,2,fairwarning diver down,1984,women&",Van Halen should have re-considered there contract before allowing such clamour to be put on cd. this is not a easy cd to take. If you want to hear Van Halen-go back and listen to the first 6..even 5150.
3,"Different, but still a great album.","I don't know why everyone thinks that this album is so bad. Sure, it's not the same Van Halen as in the past, but who stays the same for 20 years? Van Halen is not in it for the money, they are in it to have fun. There isn't one song on the new album that I think sucks, and contrary to what some may think, Eddie still blows everyone away. If you don't think so, you should have gone to a show during the 3 tour. It was insane, and Gary Cherone did as good a job singing the old and new songs as anyone else. It will take time for a new singer to get used to being in a different band. I guarantee the next album will be awesome. I don't think I wasted a penny buying this album."
4,Van Halen lives on!,"While I agree with some other critics that this album lacks the excitement and freshness of the band's earlier releases with David Lee Roth, I enjoy this album with Gary Cherone much more than I ever enjoyed any of VH's releases with Sammy Hagar. Gary brings a youthful feel to the band. He's not afraid to try new things and neither are Van Halen. I applaud Ed for the song ""How Many Say I"" because it's such a different step from where he's gone in the past. My personal favorites from ""3"" are From Afar, Dirty Water Dog, Once and Year to the Day. The fans who didn't catch VH on the 3 tour missed out on a terrific show! To me, Gary Cherone encompasses all the best parts of both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar."
3,Gary Cherrone,"This 1998 album by Van Halen has Gary Cherrone from Extreme on vocals. It has been the last album they recorded since they did this in 1998. Key tracks are: Without You, From Afar and Ballot or the Bullet. Overall I feel this is a very generic album and wouldn't recommend it to any but diehard Van Halen fans or those curious as to Cherrone's appearance."
2,Extreme Van Halen? No!,Why? If they stayed as a three piece with the great Michael Anthony singing lead (like he did on this tour for a few old numbers) it would still have been a more inspired effort than this. There is a reason why this album is rarely heard on rock radio. It's bad.
3,"""Exremely"" average?","The problem with the album isn't as much with the music as it is with the packaging. IE..You don't put Coca Cola in a Sprite bottle!That's precisely what happened here.I also think another thing that happened is that too many people were jaded by Cherones previous work which is just out and out total garbage.With the benefit of 10 years worth of hindsight, I would say that this album is pretty good. It's one of those albums that gets better as you listen to it and understand what they were shooting for.It has moments of subsantive songwriting with good melodies and hooks. There are times, however, where the album gets really heady and pays less attention to the structure.If you're looking for the flavor of Van Halen...III is definitely not the album to capture it but it's pretty descent nonetheless."
3,You people make me sick,"Best record... NO Best Production...NO Best guitar, singer,etc... ARGUABLE I don't think it is their best try either, but you all whine like babies. Grow the hell up... all of you morons. ""I won't buy another VH album again...and I've been a ""DIE-HARD"" fan for 20 years."" You all make me want to toss my cookies,how stupid you sound. Notice I only gave it 3 satrs, because yeah, it needs some work. Gary will work in the band and they will all get more comfortable with eachother in time. You jagoffs don't know what a fan is. Go to hell."
2,not impressed!,"As far as I'm concerned, this is the worst VH album I've heard. When 5150 came out, ( the first cd w/Hagar,) the band sounded different, Hagar was Hagar, He did't try to be Roth. Whether Cherone was trying to be like Hagar I'm not sure, but that is what it sounded like. Also, Eddie's gutiar drounds out the rest of the band at times through out the album. The tour was not much better either! Not Impressed at all - and I have been a loyal Van Halen fan for years."
1,Quite an Achievement,"This is the worst album by a major band in the history of recorded music. There is no logic to the form of these ""songs."""
2,EXTREME-ly disappointing,"Van Halen rocks; hands down. Im a huge fan of David Lee Roth. Sammy had some great music as well. This album was a crap slap to the face! I remember hearing ""Without You"" on the radio for the first time and being at a loss for words. The song just...fell flat. The whole album fell flat. I tried to warm up to the new sound but failed. Gary Cherone was a bad fit for Van Halen. As Im writing this review, Van Halen is set to release a new album later this year with David Lee Roth on Vocals. Ive been waiting thirteen years for some Great VH music. I hope the guys can redeem themselves. Avoid III like the plague."
2,seriously what was vh they thinking,"album actually starts off pretty good, without you and one i want are great from far, ok. its a downward spiral from there on and never picks up, no not even fire in the hole, there's something wrong when the verse sounds better than the chorus. The biggest mistake was scrapping the track 'thats why I love you' for the most un-van halen song I've ever heard 'josephina' so weird...and crap too.Finally How Many Say I is the crapest gayest song I ever heard in my entire life! Seriously what the hell were they thinking???'to know something is true....AND THEN DENEY IT!!!' Go Eddie! frkn sad. Serves as the icing on the crapest cake ever made.I will never listen to Van Halen the same way again.And the 2004 best of package doesnt redeem them. It was incredible [...] too. Best of Volume 1 was 100 times better, accept for the ultra-[...] song, dance the night away, Eddies least favourite vh song of all time, so how did it make it on there."
3,It's still Eddie!,"This is pretty bad with one of the most over rated horrible singers ever - Gary Cherone (He has proven this by his in-ability to go beyond one hit album, not to mention this is VH's wrost selling album and the only thing that changed was the singer - things that make you say hmmmmmm?). However, if you take the vocals out it's still good ole VH with Eddie experimenting and wowing as usual."
1,HEY! I EVEN WENT TO THE CONCERT OF THIS THING!,"Lord have Mercy.... I really promised myself I wasn't even going to waste time in typing a review for this abomination. But, just for the sake of collective support in this sad times for hard rockers in general. It is really, really bad.... it's not even an attempt of an album.... And guess what... I even felt in the trap and paid $35 to see this Concert in Hawaii (the VH3 tour)... Guys, if you think that VH3 is a disgrace, you should have seen (and heard) this ""Gary"" guy destroying ""When it's Love"", ""Why Can't this be Love"", ""And the Craddle Will Rock"", and to close the act, a repulsive, incredibly insulting ""rap-alternative"" version of the immortal ""Right Now"". What did Eddie have in his mind when he hired this guy???. Please, I beg you...DO NOT BUY THIS THING.... I'LL RATHER BUY THE RE-MASTERED EXTENDED VERSION OF ""THE SOUND OF MUSIC"" AND WATCH IT EVERY DAY FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK. By the way, we need a lower rating than one star......"
2,It is a pretty good album actually,"I owned it originally on CD and was witness to the tour. Gary Cherone really was awful even live. The music on this album, however, is excellent! If you can get past the terrible vocals you will find a great work from Van Halen. I would pay five dollars to have a copy but NOT 9.99!!"
3,Not a very consistent album,"This album is odd. It has no comparison with any other Van Halen release. With David Lee Roth, Van Halen was a wild party band, with Sammy Hagar, they sounded more like arena rockers with some mature lyrics. With Cherone, there are some minor highlights, specially ""Without you"" sound very Van Halenish, and Once has a very unique sound, eventhough no one can tell that's Van Halen. Anyone familiar with Extreme's work might say ""What happened to Gary's voice? "" Instead of sounding like him, Gary tries to sound more like Sammy Hagar. Cherone is great with Extreme, but he is not for Van Halen. The chemistry fails in this record.This album doesn't work as a good introduction to Van Halen for those young ones who don't know about the band. Best of Vol. 1, Van Halen, 1984 is my recommendation for those who want to start exploring Van Halen, and Pornografitti is the album for those who want to know who is Cherone.This album is not too bad, but it's not so good either."
1,Can you say,"This album is horrible. It's sole purpose is to prevent the formation of water marks on my coffee table - otherwise it is completely useless. I don't know what Eddie Van Halen was thinking, having kicked Roth out of the band a second time, and replacing him with this [...] singer.I tried listening to the album - really I did, but it was no use. This album is garbage, and not even the fact that ""Fire in the Hole"" was used in the Lethal Weapon movie could save this [...]. Don't buy this album."
1,What A Mess,"This album is a mess. Don't waste your money. When Eddie canned Sammy, he goofed big time."
1,Warning! Warning! Massive ego on the loose!,"I'll never forget the childhood ecstasy of playing ""Runnin With the Devil,"" over and over and over again on my first stereo. Now I want to forget the agony of listening to this new Van Halen record. Eddie suffers from complete lack of control on every front: the solos are boring and repetetive, the songs are all too long, the ""new"" noises are not interesting (even annoying!), and for God sake, could no one put a stop to ""How Many Say I?"" I don't see Cherone as a problem--in fact, he's mixed so low I can't tell if it's really Sammy. Worse still, fans of all things Van Halen are hard pressed to find any signs of Michael Anthony's trademark vocal, which after all is the only reason we accepted Sammy so quickly. Next time, perhaps a producer who will make Ed sit down, shut up and play guitar. And even if so, I'll still want to hear it before I shell out one penny. If you haven't bought VH3, SAVE YOURSELF!!!"
1,The greatest BOMB ever!!!,"I have given this album plenty of time, but it's got to be the greatest bomb ever by a big name rock band. The album is pathetic, and there wasn't one song that made me want to keep this out of loyalty. VH3 makes CCR's ""Mardi Gras"" (another famous bomb) look like a masterpiece.The only band to change lead singers three times successfully was Deep Purple.Van Halen III ~ Van Halen: 0 stars"
1,Eddie's Downfall,"I pulled out this CD and shook off the dust after listening to Sammy Hagar's latest CD (Ten 13). Yes, Van Halen 3 is actually worse than I remember. Not only is the music bad, but the production is awful. It sounds like Eddie found his Mr. Microphone from pre-pubescent years and called it his recording studio. Do yourself a favor and follow Sammy's career, he's obviously the brains behind the music. His ""Ten 13"" sounds better than anything Van Halen put out (even with him)."
3,not as bad as you think,"This CD isn't as bad as a lot of people say. This is some of the best guitar work I've heard out of EVH since ""Fair Warning,"" -- most especially on ""Without You,"" ""One I Want,"" and ""Year To The Day,"" and Gary Cherone's lyrics were a comfortable departure from DLR, who had good lyrics for drinking, dancing, and doing it, as well as from Sammy Hagar, who I've always found to be as lyrically one-dimensional as everyone responsible for all of today's bubble-gum pop. The only things I didn't like about the album were that a) ""How Many Say I"" and b) overall, Gary was pushed way too hard -- in some cases he oversang. Still, these guys are musicians first, rock stars second, and 'III' was another step in their respective musical evolutions."
3,it's still van halen,"So this wasn't Van Halen I, it was still Van Halen. I don't think it's fair to expect Gary to be the end-all/be-all on his first album with the band. However, since I understand he is now gone,I guess that's what we all expected and he couldn't live up to it. I have no doubt though that Ed, Alex, Mike and whoever they choose to replace Gary will be back in top VH form very soon. And remember ...Even bad Van Halen is better than most other music being sold today....."
1,Gotcha!!!,"Hi...My name is Ed Van Halen and my band is terrible.We sound like middle age bores and although our writing has never been good,at least it was fun.BUT YOU BOUGHT THIS GARBAGE CD.More money for me...GOTCHA!!!"
1,Bring Back Sammy or Dave!,"I got into VH when Sammy was the lead singer, but the best era is the Roth era by far. And judging from Dave's solo stuff, he can still hold his own vocally. This album is awful and is a sorry tribute to the name of a former great band. They struck gold by continuing their success with a new singer after Roth...they haven't struck gold this time. They went to the well one too many times."
4,One of the most UNDERATED vh albums !!!!!,"Van Halen has been put down way too much!!!! This disc has some amazing songs! Eddie really tried everything on this one.I love the Dave and Sammy stuff,and I think this one rates up there with everything else they've done! For me,the highlight is the song ""Year to the Day"".it contains a very long bluesy solo,in the middle,which was just AMAZING!!!!Just give it a chance !!!! David S."
1,Why did van halen even record this album????,"VH III The Worst Van Halen album ever realesed, first off let me say i am a big van halen fan and have almost all of there albums anyways this album though isnt van halen, its some cheap imitation of a good band. This guy just dosent fit with the band, i mean its a good thing they finaly reunited with David Lee Roth the bands meant to be lead singer. But this album deserves to be thrown away, van halen rules but this album most certanily does not. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!such a waste of moneyVAN HALEN RULESTHIS ALBUM DOESNT"
2,who wanted the guy from Extreme?,"Van Halen hired Gary Cherone to replace Sammy Hagar as lead vocalist in 1998. The one and only album to feature the former Extreme frontman more or less bombed! Not to say that Van Halen III is terrible, it certaintly isn't any worse than the last two Van Halen albums with Hagar. Heck Fire in the Hole is actually a pretty decent song. So, Van Halen III is fair, probably about equal to Women and Children First, Fair Warning, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, and Balance, if you liked any of those albums you'd probably like this one."
3,Really good rockers,"Even if Gary Cherone's voice does not match Hagar's or Roth's quality, the album has really good rockers, one of them even was used in the soundtrack of a movie. Great guitar riffs. The bad thing about this album are several of the ballads which maybe are the worst songs ever recorded by Van Halen (like the one with Eddie on the vocal duties). Anyway is a powerful Van Halen and that what really matters."
1,"This Sucks, Say I","Wow! This album has to be one of the worst ever created. I'd rather dunk my head in an unflushed toilet than be subjected to this filth again. Please Eddie, wrap it up!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"Van Halen got rid of Hagar & Roth to end up with this. This cd belongs in the garbage. If they were smart, they would settle their differences & bring back David Lee Roth, just give him a different dressing room. Please don't waste your money on this."
1,Very Disappointing.,Unfortunately I think the band has had it. Eddie sounds like garbage and the new singer is not all that. The best song on the album has to be Without You but that ain't sayin' much. I can't believe I spent money getting this album.
2,Very disappointing,"I was very excited that Cherone was the new lead singer. Extreme (Cherone's previous) was one of the best groups ever, as well as one of the most misunderstood and underrated. I bought this album the first day it was released in hopes of a great album, I was quite disappointed. It's not any one area that's so disappointing, in fact there are some high points, it's just that the album fails as a whole. I don't share the other reviewer's enthusiasm and intrigue with VH's lead singer soap opera (in fact, this is a turn-off for me). If you want a really good VH album, buy the Greatest Hits, it's an excellent album.I'm still hopeful that VH can turn it around with Cherone (consider purchasing Extreme II and III, III is one of the most ambitious albums ever recorded) because Cherone and Eddie VH are both so talented. Pass on this one and get Extreme and VH's greatest hits -- you'll be much happier a week and a year from now."
4,Different isn't bad...,"Though 3 is a departure from what most would term ""typical"" VH fare, it is one of their better albums, in my opinion. They experiment musically on this album like they have not done in a long time, and some great songs come from it (i.e. Once). Though this album isn't perfect, it's a great start for the third incarnation of the band. Even if the album doesn't do it for you, check out Gary and the boys live; they put on one heck of a show, whether you're a Dave, Sammy, or Gary fan."
1,NEW LEAD SINGER'S FAULT,"The music is OK - Eddie...you are OK - so what were you thinking???? What kills this CD is the lead singer. C'mon Eddie - DO THE RIGHT THING. Swallow your pride, get on your knees and ask (beg if you must) Mr. Hagar to return. You had a great thing going - BE A PROFESSIONAL - tell him you are sorry and ask him to rejoin Van Halen. IT'S NOT TOO LATE - DO IT FOR YOUR FANS - WE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE GIVEN YOU THE MONEY TO BUILD YOUR STUDIO -SO JUST DO IT. YOU OWE US!!!!"
1,This deserves zero stars.,"Terrible, horrible, awful album. Time for Van Halen to just retire...Eddie could just be a studio musician or something, but this kind of crap will just taint the Van Halen legacy."
1,"Hey Edward, this is your cure for Lead Singer Disease?","Yes Edward, the question has been posed to you. Its a shame that you, Michael, Alex,and now Gary Cherone instead of taking the opportunity to take the band to the next level, offer the fans a musical can of Spam. Pieces of different types of music slapped together in an seriously toned manner. What happened to the music being fun again? Ask DLR or Sammy."
1,Van Halen..... RIP,"All I can say is good bye Van Halen. I have been the BIGGEST VH fan with Dave and even Sammy. I have met them except Eddie. VH is VH with Dave, but Sammy entered the band at a perfect time when Ed's music writing style was changing. You can hear it in 1984.When I bought VH3 on the first day, I put it in the CD player. I had already heard ""The one I want"" which I thought stunk, but I listened to the first 4 songs, I cried ( not really)! I guess the album would have been OK or pretty good if Sammy wrote the lyrics and sang on the album. Ed needs to stop interfering with lyrics, get Dave or Sammy back and PICK UP ALOT OF HEINIKEN's and start pounding! If these things don't happen Van Halen will RIP because Warner Bros. will drop them just like they did to Ted Templeman."
1,DECLINE DID NOT BEGIN HERE...,"Of course chosing Cherone to sing could only lead to such a distateful album like this one, but VH decline began before, in BALANCE. I hope they take their time and choose the right path to follow: that of retirement."
1,very very bad,who thought of the idea of Gary Cherone joing Van Halen? he sounds like a bad Karoke 3rd tier Sammy Hager.the songs are formula and don't spark an ounce of feeling.the cut with Eddie singing isn't to bad maybe he should do it more? anything but the wackness of Cherone's vocals.i'm glad they let him go.he was straining to much.he should go back to Extreme and give Savage Garden a run for it's money with sappy pop.
1,Rejoice! Gary Is Leaving Van Halen!,"This has got to be the most reviewed album I have seen on Amazon, with good reason. No one can express just how amazingly bad it is. But fear not! Gary is leaving VH! They'll probably still release the next LP which they finished with Gary, but this is a step in the right direction. I doubt Sam and Dave will be included in the next line up, but I wonder what Axl Rose is up to..... Anyway, I guess Ed got the point, and I hope he decides to start making ROCK music again. Who knows. I did buy this album, and most of the other post-Roth records, just hoping with all hope, that the man that gave us Fair Warning and 1984, and to a lesser extent, OU812, would deliver again. So far, I've been dissapointed. But with this news, I will hope that the VH flag is still flying high. To Sam, Dave and Gary, a suggestion: Start a band!"
2,Van Halen???,"I did not care for this album, and it seems neither did many Van Halen fans, either of the Hagar or Roth variety. Probably why it is harder to find...nobody bought it! If you really like VH, do not purchase this album expecting it to fall in line with all the others. Almost sounds like more of a tribute album."
1,One of the greatest mistakes ever in rock n roll.,"This has got to be one of the greatest bombs in rock history. And it will go down in time as a serious mistake by a legendary band. The songs just plain suck, and Eddie just sounds as he's trying to do his best without delivering the goods. I hope the 2004 reunion will bring Sammy back to the studio for a comeback album."
1,Perhaps the worst rock album of all time,"After hearing this album, I seriously considered returning it to the store for a refund. Ending up being the only album that I ever threw out due to content."
1,Enough of this bilious swill!,"The Van Halen of the Hagar era sounded like Journey. This sounds like a bad tribute band version of the disappointing devolution of Van Halen into Van Hagar. The majority of the remaining fans of a once exhilarating band want the return of the David Lee Roth (DLR) - fronted version. Although Van Hagar had more number 1 albums the DLR fronted Van Halen sold far more units - by a nearly 2 to 1 margin and remain the calssic Van Halen played on classic rock stations today. I would rhetorically ask Ed Van Halen - is it so wrong to give the fans who've made you rich what they want? Don't you think Steven Tyler or Mick Jagger give their guitarists a migraine from time to time? Yet they, like David Lee Roth, front a band like you play guitar - as only a handful of charismatic lead singers can. And doesn't Van Halen's legacy, like its fans, deserve better than unflattering comparisons to Journey?"
1,Van Halen owes me $15.95 + tax,"I am one of the 500,000 die hard Van Halen fans that was ripped off by buying this album when it first came out. The bottom line on this one is that while Gary Cherone has a good voice, the song writing is just total crap. There is not one memorable tune. Gary never had a chance. You might read a few reviews that say the poor album performance is because fans revolted against a new front man, etc. Not true. You might find a few pretentious music snobs saying Van Halen's fan base just didn't understand that album. Also not true. Bad song writing and production = a crappy album and that is what you get when you buy Van Halen III. When Van Halen refunds my $15.95 + tax I may buy another album, but not while this steaming hunk of garbage remains in my cd collection."
2,Worth getting for Without You......used.,"This isn't a great Van Halen album, but the song Without You has grown on me, so at least listen to it once, it's VERY cheap used, so how can you go wrong??A career encompassing compilation must include that song!P.S. catch up with Sammy and Michael Anthony:Chickenfoot"
1,The only Van Halen album I ever got rid of.,"Okay, everyone says the guitar work on this record is great. So what? It's been good, if not better on previous records. Gary Cherone, formerly of Van Halen rip-off band, Extreme, sounds like a Hagar clone at best. The lyrics are worse than even the worst crap Sammy came up with. And need I mention 'How Many Say I'? I almost cried when I heard that, not because it was ""deep"", but because it was so forkin' awful! (Sorry, Ed.) I was never a fan of the Van Hagar line-up, but this crap sent me running back to 5150. Here's my barometer. When I sold this album, along with Dave's DLR Band release(better than III, but still not very good)Dave's album brought back more than VHIII. There's some vindication for ya Dave.(Don't worry, Dave, I may have sold your album, but new Van Halen out-sucks you ten to one. You never see many Roth-Era records in the used bin.)"
1,VAN HALEN IS DEAD!!!-you better find Sammy or Dave-dont buy,"dont buy this one it sucks bad ,thats what happens when you dog out 2 of the best singers for this bands style.sorry Ed,you need to think back to VH-1&2--Fair Warning--Ed with crap like this even die hards will drop your boring attempts at the good old days.for your own good find Sammy!!!!-or hang it up.ex fan from Texas-and Calif. I HATE THIS CD"
2,Bad,I bought this cd the first day it came out and was disapointed with it immediatly. Ballot or the Bullet being the only good song that has any meaning the rest of the album dissapoints.
3,Im not sure about VHIII.,Im not sure about VHIII. I wish you could bring back the past and David Lee Roth back in the group but you can't. I didn't like the album the first time I listened to it. But I like it a little bit more each time I listen to it. Its like they recorded a album and just needed a body in the group for lead singer. You can hardly understand Gary. He does sound alot like Sammy. I not sure if this is on purpose or not. Best song is FIRE IN THE HOLE. It does ROCK. Maybe the next album will be better after they have a chance to work with Gary. Remember 5150 CD.Im a die hard Van Halen Fan and I will give them a chance. I hope Ed and Gary get better with time. Van Halen fans don't give up. We all have bad days. And this album not bad. Its just not thier greatest work.
2,Down and out instead of down and dirty,"I am a die hard Van Halen fan. To me this just isn't it. In previous albums the music would jump out at you and grab you. This time it just kind of stood there in a blank stare. The new singer had a good voice, there just isn't anything backing him. Maybe next time....."
4,I don't understand why people hate this so much,"Its in my opinion that this isn't so bad of an album. Its not among their best, but I particularly like the songsFrom AfarFire in the HoleA Year to the DayI find those to be, should you choose to ignore the lyrics of Fire in., to be pretty classic songs. This album really isn't so bad. Just don't think of it as much of a step forward from Hagar. Me, I'm a DLR fan, and honestly, I think they should just get him back."
4,"A good, But not great album","How can you dis this album, though VH3 does not come close to 1984 or For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, but this a good album. There are some good songs, some average, some terrible songs.I think the way Gary Cherone sounded on this album, Sammy Hagar should of been around a little longer. Eddie Van Halen plays some excellent licks on this album.In my opinion, the solo in the song Year To The Day beats the hit single off this album(Without You. Even though this album got mixed reviews from fans and critics Van Halen should come out with another album i think they still have some magic left they just need to work things out.All In All, VAN HALEN still ROCKS the World!"
4,"Different era of the band, but Great Album!","Although Sammy and Dave no longer front the band, this album is definately worth a listen for Van Halen fans and rock fans in general. Gary Cherone does great in his debut performance (and, sadly, also his final performance) with the Might Van Halen and there are plenty of gems on this recording. ""Without You"", ""One I Want"", ""Dirty Water Dog"" and ""Fire in the Hole"" are excellent songs. ""Year to the Day"" and ""Ballot or the Bullet"" are also noteworthy efforts. The biggest downside with this album is the production by Mike Post, who could have helped package this set of songs into a more cohesive album. His biggest mistake was leaving the song ""That's Why I Love You"" OFF this album. This was the best song that Cherone recorded with VH and would have really set a different tone to the whole album if it was included. Sadly, most people will never hear this song. That aside, Van Halen 3 remains a very strong effort and is definately worth a listen!"
1,:-( Ex Van Halen Fan ! Can I put Less Than 1 Star??,"Man ! I have got to say that, as a fan of Van Halen for half of my life (over 15 years), this has got to be THE absolute WORST album I think I have ever heard from this once fantastic group. The music is .... The lyrics are .... The vocals are .... C'Mon Eddie - are you trying to tell me that this is the best you and the boys could do? Look - do the right thing by everyone and bring back Sammy. Yeah yeah.... some of the Roth songs were good but Sammy brought out the best in Van Halen - for 10 straight years. To all those people out there who love great rock 'n roll by a great band - do not pick up this album - it will make you want to turn to techno music !!"
5,An Under-rated Album,"Don't get me wrong, I loved the David Lee Roth era but I think that Sammy Hagar destroyed Van Halen. Van Halen III is probably the best VH album since 1984. Songs like ""Without You,"" ""One I Want,"" ""Once,"" Dirty Water Dog,"" and ""Fire in the Hole,"" make this album great. It is definately a good album to pick up, especially if you can find it used."
5,Cool book to read to slightly older kids.,"The amount of text in this book makes it look like an early reader, but the basic questions it poses can make an adult stop and think. It covers the essential questions that plague humans since we became aware of our own existence within the world. Why are we here? It does not really answer that question, but it poses it in such a way that you just feel good."
4,A Very Fruitful Book,"Fruitful because I picked up the book some 35 years ago when I had no idea of what theology was; I read the book and something told me - a neophyte - that I could think about these things too as I sensed he arrived at some wrong conclusions. Thus, began my formal endeavors in higher education in theology. I have long since lost the book and can't remember a thing about any specifics in it. I am still doing theology and trying to understand - maybe time to get the book again!"
2,wish they were better,"I wish these were better. The cd labels go onto the cd quite nicely, but after a week, they start coming off and warping. The pack should come with a burnishing tool, or the adhesive needs to be stronger. Also, the template is not that great to use. It's a word doc and wasn't easy to use. I had to turn it into a pdf and then bring it into Illustrator in order to make it more usable."
4,Genesis ReAct Pro In-Line Console Dive Computer,"The compass is great, I'm not sure if the thermometer is working on this unit. The temp always seems to be at 78-82 degrees and I have done some pretty deep dives that should have made it move more than that and I've seen it against buddies thermometers. The ReAct Pro is pretty nice. After you play with it for a while and figure out how it works it gets the job done. One of my dive buddies has a unit that is half the price, has one button and in addition to all this does also logs the dive temperatures. I do like it though, I just don't love it for the price. $329.00"
5,A must for a proper install!,"I bought this kit along with Grant's 967 steering wheel for my 1995 Buick Roadmaster. There are no official kits for my car because it came with airbags and you aren't really supposed to get rid of them, but mine was malfunctioning and I decided to go with a different look.This is probably the closest kit for my car as everything works perfect except for the trim bezel which wasn't large enough in diameter to match the column and was too tall as well so it rubbed without spacers. I made a new trim bezel out of solid aluminum and it all works and looks perfect. I painted my trim bezel to match the interior color and the trim bezel in the kit is primed black and ready for paint as well."
4,"si fumamos el tapete es porque se acabo el tabacco, buey","i heard of this band on my recent trip to mexico and i bought all their cds. i also recomend ""donde juegan las ninas"". molotov continues to improve and their latest cd continues to impress. although some of the songs are not as earpleasing as their previous efforts, their lyrics continue to make the listener replay the disk over and over. a lot of listeners will not understand the essence of the lyrics, but for a descendant of mexico, it really hits ""home."" people who speak ""spanglish""- a slang for bilingual - will find this disk enjoyable as well. i wish that english radio stations and other forms of media take notice and promote this band; i would like to see them live. for all the media outlets out there who haven't taken notice ""chingo yo, chinga tu, chigen a su madre!"""
3,"Not as good as ""Donde jugaran las ninas""","Like the title said, donde jugaran las ninas was way better than this one. Lyrics and music just seemed to be random and the whole style was more of rap than anything else, not worth being called rock en espanol, so if that's what you are looking for don't get this album."
2,No Es Lo Que Esperabas De Molotov,"Este album es totalmente desepcionante para los grandes fans de molotov como yo. Este album carece de calidad lirica, las unicas buenas rolas de este CD son Hit Me y Frijolero las demas son burdas y estupidas. Si apenas vas conociendo a molotov y quieres comprar uno de sus albums mejor compra Donde Jugaran las Niñas? es mucho mejor que este..."
4,Rocked my world.,"This cd rocks from the first song, and when I thought it couldn't get better it did. Consistently. Do yourself a favor, buy this music. Hit Me (Gimme Tha Power II) is awesome."
5,Super music,"political, danceable! First heard this in Turkey and then saw the video on LINKTV. Great music"
2,Bad,"Love of ""Mouse on Mars"" may tempt you to buy this...My advice? Don't. It sucks. It's pointless---juststray percussive elements that go absolutely nowhereexcept to annoy the listener waiting in vain for some creative spark.If you desire excellent other-wordly percussive electronica,explore the genius CDS of the Autechre, but leave thispiece of crap CD alone. It's really bad. The only reasonI gave it two stars instead of one is that there are novocals and I appreciate that, but otherwise this CD shouldbe hurled directly into an incinerator. It's b-a-d bad."
5,The Sweet Smell of Almonds......,Just simply a great smelling and soothing oil; It's just the best. I can not stand to be without it.
5,any woman will apreciate this!,"i got this to do something special for my wife,i gave her a nice massage the oil quality is absolutely great and the smell is quite seductive. this is an entrancing product so use with caution ;)"
4,Great massage oil,"I have always read that almond oil is the best massage oil, and from my experience it sure is. There is not much of a smell to it unless you get your nose right on the skin and you only need a palm full to create a good 30 minute back massage. It is a bit messy but that comes with any oil. Store it in a bag to prevent leaking while in storage.,"
3,"Works well, but slightly medicinal fragrance","This oil works well. It lasts a long time, but doesn't leave skin feeling greasy. The fragrance isn't great, though. I can't really describe it, but it is kind of bitter or medicinal. It isn't overpowering, so the oil is still usable, but I don't think that I would buy it again."
3,good but...,"The ""feeling"" of the oil was very good; however, it left a residue on sheets that I did not experience with other oils used which worked as well."
4,Another excelent book if you wonder what daily life was like in Egypt over 2000 years ago!,"What fascinated me about this book is that it explains several aspects of daily life in an Egypt, not only dominated by the Macedonian Lagides, but in a land where Greek settlers and Egyptian natives coexisted. It is quite interesting to learn how the two groups related to each other in their city life, rural space, property, bodies of law, religious beliefs, national identity, and of course family ties by marriage and blood. The translation is quite good (not that I've read the original French version to compare both, but it reads smoothly in English). However, I only give it 4 stars as the book (which is very interesting at first) became a little tiresome for me at the end.Nefertiti: Unlocking the Mystery Surrounding Egypt's Most Famous and Beautiful Queen"
5,THE ROMANTICS RULE!!!!!!!!,"These songs kick some serious butt! GREAT songwriting, (a few standouts upon my first listen are the leadoff track ""Devil in Me"", Out of my mind(into my head), New Kinda Pain, love the Kinks cover ""I need you""), and I LOVE the production...all this delicious analog...gorgeous warm and fuzzy guitar sounds, phenomenal vocals, what more can a person ask for??? This is what a record is supposed to sound like...digital sucks. Kudos to The Romantics!"
5,"Gritty, real, and overdue","Congratulations to the Romantics for reuniting and issuing a CD that is not only excellent, but relevant."
2,Not the Romantics you remember,"A lone voice in the wilderness here. The Romantics apparently lost their ability to write decent songs once Jimmy Marinos left the band in 1985. If you like their first four albums, classics one and all, AVOID THIS ALBUM. It will lead only to disappointment, much like it's predecessor, ""Rhythm Romance,"" the first album they made without Mr. Marinos. Skip this; you're not missing a thing."
1,Laughably bad in every way,"Do you want to see just how bad a bad movie can be? Rent this one and see for yourself. The acting is horrible, the script is trying to be Twilight, the music is just okay, and the effects are beyond cheap and cheesy. How on earth do these movies get made?"
2,A worthwhile book but with a few errors,As a self defense instructor I am always looking for new sources of information on effective methods. Defending Ourselves teaches methods that I feel are more appropriate in the dojo than on the street. The section on firearms contains many errors and over simplifications. The author should have made an effort to consult an expert on the topic or eliminated the section altogether. The book encourages women to take responsiblity for their own safety and well being. Something I agree with completely.
2,Some scenes well written,"Overall, the story line addressed the issues attempted, but not as well as it could have been carried out. The characters were believable and you even felt involvement. I'm just not into this sort of novel, but I did believe that some of the scenes in the story were very well written."
1,Marware Sportsuit Convertible for iPod Nano,"This casing is totally useless! Not only did I have to replace it 2 weeks after its purchase as it tore and stretched from regular use as many other Marware casings. The replacement was no better but by then the Toronto Apple store would no longer give me a replacement. I contacted Marware who were happy to have me ship them the defective casing AT MY OWN COST and when sending me a replacement, being in Canada I was slapped with a nice $21.87 CAD import charge! Ridiculous! I wish I read the reviews for other such Marware products and never had to go through all these hassles. DON'T BUY THIS CASING! It's a good design but TERRIBLE choice of materials offering no protection for your iPod since it's soft and easily torn."
4,MMMMM,"They were a little stale when they arrived, but they are perfect for Banana Pudding, which is what I bought them for."
2,mwoah...,"I bought this cd because I'm a great fan of Cox, but I was a bit disappointed when I heard it. It's the kind of easy listening that even my parents don't play anymore. Of course, there are a few tracks that I do like, but I prefer the technomusic Carl Cox plays most of the time... In my opinion, the cd isn't really one piece of music, as I am used to with mixed albums. It's just a compilation of tracks put on a cd to make money in an easy way!"
5,My son loves it,I have read this to my son every night since I bought it. It is well written and has nice drawings. My son is 2 and he sits patiently the entire time I read it.
3,Good Book,This was a very good book! Thomas works very hard and is very thoughtful. He proves that he is a very useful engine and earns a note in his stocking from FatherChristmas.
5,A nice Christmas story for kids who love Thomas,"My son loves all things trains and Thomas, so we got this to read to him throughout the past holiday season. It's a nice story with attractive artwork. I would recommend it for all the little boys and girls who love their Thomas."
3,Thomas,"I think I am done buying Thomas items. The pictures are beautiful, but the story is a bit lame. My grandson may have outgrown Thomas, but he lost interest in the story half way through."
4,excellent book poor condition,"up on initially receiving this used book, I immediately questioned whether it was listed in good fair or poor condition. My conclusion is that the seller misled the purchaser on the condition of the cover but the inside was near perfect. Content wise this came across as more of a collegiate book but I have no regrets and truly enjoyed everything from basic water and plant chemistry, to use of plants for aquascaping and some very informative information by species of some of the more common plants of which i will use many in my new aquarium. without this book i would have made many mistakes but by now i have adapted my aquarium plans."
4,aquarium plants,The book is an excellen read on the topic. I particularly liked the detailed diagarams and the general section explaining in detail how to prepare a planted aquarium. The section on the specific plant types could have been more detailed and including more plant types and information.
1,What a waste of money,Don't purchase this book unless you are a botanist. It is very difficult to understand and the layout impossible to follow.
4,great but somewhat disappointing,This a great introduction piece to plant aquarium and all should read it. Beginners will benefit immensely with many tips on starting a plant aquarium. Also the photos on the plants were excellent.However on a critical note the author has given us a limited range of plants as compared to other books. So to claim the book as an encyclopedia is a misnomer. Secondly as an academic it would be nice to admit that one has changed one's opinion in the search for truth. In his previous book[I forgot the title..I've given it away]it was stated dogmatically that snails must be removed indiscriminately but in this book this animal retains some redemptive value as an algae eater. And there are a few more examples where the author apparently has been converted to another view....perhaps of Diana Walstad?But overall this is still an important contribution to the plant aquarist hobby.
4,Wonderful book for beginners,"This book is clearly written, easy to understand and beautifully illustrated with photos. It includes loads of information on how to setup a planted tank, choose plants that will survive in the conditions you can provide, and how to provide proper nutrition and lighting. There is only one omission I think should be in the book - there is no specific mention of Flourite as a substrate, which perhaps would be included in the ""nutrient rich substrate"" category Hiscock discusses."
4,Ideal for beginners.,"The reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that water parameters were not detailed for each plant (i.e. kH & pH). These are very important factors to consider in planting a tank, and were shortsightedly omitted by the author.However, this book contains a very good guide as to the planting location, care, maintenance, nutrition, and life cycles of plants in general. Everything from plant selection to disease/deficiency symptom troubleshooting are included in this book and I would highly recommend this book as a starting point for beginning aquarists."
5,Great overview of aquarium plants,I am starting my first planted tank and I bought this book to give me an idea what to plant. Its just what I needed and very well done book with great pictures and descriptions. It is organized very well.
1,Defects happen. Poor customer service doesn't have to.,"I purchased this filter for a 30 gallon freshwater tank. It was to replace my Tetra Whisper 60 which had run faithfully and quietly for 10 years. The Tetra Whisper 40 was very noisy from the start. I tried dismantling and cleaning the impeller and chamber with no improvement. I gave it a couple weeks thinking it may work itself out but it only got worse. I called Tetra customer service and heard the ""we are experiencing high call volumes...."" message, so I opted to send an email to customer service requesting assistance. That was over a week ago and I have not had a response yet. In the mean time, I had to replace the filter since it was very noisy and sounding on the brink of failure. I can't recommend any Tetra products after this experience!"
1,WHAT LOUD NOISE?,"WHEN YOU GUYS SAY IT IS LOUD AND NOISY, IS IT DUE TO THE MOTOR OR WATER FALL FROM THE FILTER PLEASE MAKE SURE YOUR STATEMENT ARE CLEAR BECAUSE YOU CAN CONFUSE BUYER.HAVING THE FLOW OF WATER FALLING IN YOUR FISH TANK WILL MAKE A WATERFALL NOISE WHICH IS TO ME VERY CALMING, BUT IF YOUR REFERRING TO THE FILTER MOTOR MAKING A LOUD NOISE THEN THAT'S AN ISSUE. I'M NOT HERE TO CORRECT ANYBODY JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WHAT THE HELL YA TALKING ABOUT LOUD NOISE AND THAT."
5,Great Product,This product has great water movement and I love the adjustable flow as I am able to adjust for times when I have fry in the tank versus strong adults. I really like the clear tubing as it blend nicely in my tank and doesn't stick out in sales photos. I will be ordering more for the rest of my tanks.
1,NOISY,I had an old Whisper filter that was gradually failing. The new filter has a different impeller design and it looks like there is no way to tighten up the impeller to get rid of the vibration. The filter is so loud I have to turn it off when I get a phone call. Shopping for a new filter now.
3,"Not like my older ""Whisper"" Power Filter!!!!","The other reviewers were absolutely correct! This isn't the ""Whisper""Power Filter of old. It is noisy! I have two aquariums, one with an older Whisper Power Filter that works great with little fuss & isn't noisy at all. I purchased this new 40 Gal. Whisper Power Filter to replace an AQUA-Tech Power Filter that was TOTAL JUNK!! The new Whisper does an awsome job of filtering & cleaned my 30gal. cichlid tank to crystal clear in a heartbeat.But it is very noisy. I'm always adjusting the cover as that seems to vibrate a lot."
2,"Too noisy, indeed!","I did not listen to the reviews noting excess noise with this ""WHISPER"" model. I have it running and the rattling is REALLY loud enough to be distracting. I would return it but it will cost $6 in shipping since it's not directly from Amazon. I can put that money towards the new filter I'm going to have to buy so will count this a total $20 loss. I've have many filters over the past 40 years and never encountered one this loud. Listen to those reviews!!! Buy another model."
2,Kills Frogs,"Like others have stated, the filter is a bit noisy but that's not why I hate this thing so much. I started adding frogs to the tank a month after using it and it has killed all of them! Putting a dwarf frog in the tank was probably stupid on my part, but it doesn't make any since that it even kills the larger ones. The first one got its legs caught and suffocated and the second one was in the top, severed in half. Even when I'm just adjusting the knob to feed the fish, the power from the filter slams them into the glass! I will never buy anything by this brand again.7/29 update: It is possible to duct tape the cover, to keep them from hopping in. Why I up'd the rating on this... I have no idea."
3,"Loud, but gets job done","I love my Whipser 10, so I thought this Whisper 40 would be great. Well, it wasn't great. It's loud, it makes a humming noise. It vibrates too much I think, and that causes the humming/rattling noise to occur. I have to turn my filter off at night just so I can sleep (the tank is in the bedroom). It works well otherwise, but the noise is just a shame. Too bad. I don't recommend this filter, spend your money on something that is actually ""whispering"""
4,Good filter: not quite as quiet as I would have liked.,The filter keeps the tank nice and clean (when I remember to change the Bio-Bag). it is in my daughters room and it does bother her some nights. I was hoping for a silent filter but it is audible. It has gotten to the point of white noise in the house now. It is much quieter than the filter I had when I was a kid.
2,Noisy but gets the job done,"It does a great job of cycling the water even in my 55 gallon tank. However the motor does not ""whisper"". It is quite a loud and constant buzzy sort of hum. I would probably buy this again since it is such a good filter. But it's not necessarily for a living room where you'll constantly be competing with the tv during quiet scenes for what you hear."
1,Not the Whisper of old...,"I have used the Tetra Whisper filters on many different tanks for many years. I was quite sad to see themapparently go away for a while. Seeing the filters available once again and I immediately bought a couple,actually three now. Two have been returned and I am using the current one till I find a replacement.The Whisper filters of old I thought were quite aptly named since were it not being able to see the water movementacross the surface of the tank you would never even know they were running.NOT the case now... the first one was so noisy I thought for sure there has to be some kind of defect. Returningit and buyihng another. Well.. once again, incredibly noisy. Thinking third time was a charm I decided to tryone more. I don't know what Tetra has done to these filters but whatever it was, please UNDO it. Unless you meantWhisper to be completely sarcastic."
2,Junk junk junk....,I had a good experience with the whisper 60 and the whispser 20. but for some reason the whisper 40 is so loud.... it started off quiet for about a month and i was happy(not to mention i could save some money) . but as soon as i took it out to clean the tubes and impeller. booom louder and louder it got(i went thru 3 of these) . i cleaned them up and returned them all. DO NOT BUY THE 40 FOR SOME REASON THEY CANT GET IT RIGHT... I purchased the marineland emperor 280 power filter(it was 15 dollars more)but well spent and well made. its so quiet i only hear my air pump. sorry whisper. but u should revamp the 40 gallon powerfilter. its junk...
2,Noisy aquarium filter,"Normally the Whisper filters are very quiet for me, but this one is so noisy with vibration, we decided to not use it."
2,"Stay clear of this filter, unless you like noise!","Just received the Tetra Whisper Power Filter. I have never heard such a NOISY filter in my life! Lots of humming and clunking!! I talked to my local pet store, to see if this was normal. She said to check the for any blockages. I thought maybe something got shifted in shipping. Nothing looked out of line. I am consideriing sending it back, as I have noticed from other customers reviews, that this is common for this filter. Not sure if Amazon will take it back or not? But I AM going to try!!"
4,northstar potential,"This album was quite the present suprise. I didnt know what to expext from northstar on their own full length, and they delivered an almost masterpiece. The only drawbacks are the skits, which are in no way related to the album. There are only 12 tracks but each is awesome. The production from the rza is outstanding, his best in a couple of years. So go out and purchase this album and support the wu. Wu-Tang Forever."
4,good wu fam cd,get this cd its pretty good compare to most wu fam cd's and rza just spreads is love to the west coast. WU-TANG FOREVER
5,WU SOUND FOR THE YEAR 3000,"THIS CD WAS A BIG SURPRISE, I HEARD THESE CATS ON KILLA BEES THE STING AND THOUGHT THAT THEY STOOD OUT, SO I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS RELEASE. I HOW EVER DID NOT EXPECT THIS CD TO BE AS GOOD AS IT IS.ARMAND VAN HELDEN DELIVERS 2 AMAZING BEATS AND I HOPE RZA USES HIM FOR FUTURE PROJECTS, THE REST OF THE BEATS ARE HANDLED BY RZA AND MATHEMATICS SO YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS TRULY RARE. THERE IS REALY NO SONG TO SKIP HERE EXCEPT THE SKITS. NOTEWORTHY IS TRACK 11 SO SO SERIOUS, THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST EXPLOSIVE BEATS IN A VERY LONG TIME AND IF THIS DOESNT GET YOUPUMPED NOTING WILL. TRULY WORTH GETTING.- G23 SOUTH AFRICA"
2,Weak,"On the wu tang killa bees compilation the swarm,the weakest group was called black knights of the northstar,2 of the emcees were tolerable,and 2 sucked, the really bad ones meko and christbearer decided to make a group consisting of them,what you get is a weak unit who can't pump a solid album,save your money and buy shabazz's album instead."
2,"This is garbage compared to real Wu affiliates (Killarmy, Sunz of man, Gravediggaz)","I ordered this only because I am collecting the whole wu-tang catalog. but basically, The production all sounds the same and overusing the helium sounding high pitch voice. even tho Rza and matahamatics have a couple productions on this. These are Sub par Wu-production. Black knights like Doc doom,and Monk were tolerable but Northstar is Terrible I dont know why RZA decided to try to expose these guys. Sounds like they did too much Ketamine and cant talk or pronounciate words. I can understand Slang and all that but I dont get WTF they are trying to say on the skits either. I Think RZA was smokin too much Dust when he put this out. I have a hard time inducting it into my Wu-catalog. Id rather sell it."
4,It's pretty good...,"They remind me of the Alkaholiks, which of course is great... Northstar might not be as good, but they definitly lazed it... Rza didn't produce all the tracks, it wouldve been a little better if that was the case but this still manage to entertain.They diss 50 Cent in one skit which is always fun..."
4,Andy Williams Christmas DVD,Great DVD of the OLD Andy Williams Christmas TV Shows.FUN to re-live their Holiday Spirit...FUN to see themany guests! A HOLIDAY MUST for those that remember!!
5,Great Christmas DVD for everyone,"I saw this program first air on PBS a few years ago. It took me a while to find it, but it was worth the wait. The DVD shows many clips from the Andy Williams Christmas Shows while also talking with his son, wife, Donny Osmond, and Andy himself as they reminisce about the show and what it meant to them. If there's one TV show that shows us the importance of family during the holiday season, this is it. It's only an hour long, but it's well worth owning so you can share with family and friends for years to come. I make it a point to watch this at least once every year around Christmas. I used to have to watch it on an old VHS tape that we used to record the show when it aired. Now, I have it to own on DVD and it looks fantastic. For such a reasonable price, this is a must own for anyone who enjoys Andy Williams' Christmas music or the Christmas season in general."
5,Great music,We went to Branson in Nov. 2011 and Andy wasn't performing because of illness. This is the next best thing. Classic Christmas music sung by a great singer. The backgrounds and visual effects are top notch.
2,Not really enjoyable,"I ordered this video while looking for some Christmas concert, but I'm sorry to say I don't like this one. I think it may be appealing to those who are nostalgic of a bygone period, but to me it's a bit weak and tacky."
3,Muffled intros to each number.,"Sorry, but the ""Best of Christmas"" DVD of Andy's intros to each number are so muffled I couldn't understand anything at all."
4,If you are a fan of 60's and 70's Christmas Television...,"...this will make you very, very happy. I wish there had been a little more time devoted to the sketches I remember from the Andy Williams specials (especially the bear who always wanted a cookie) and a little less time devoted to just plain singing, but overall I was pleased with this DVD. Heck, the matchy-matchy costumes on the Williams Brothers alone (even down to the shoes...in one segment each of the brothers wears a different color slacks-and-sweater combination--red, green, yellow, etc.--and their suede shoes are the same color as the rest of the outfit; it's a dizzying display of fabulous late 60's kitsch) are worth the purchase price, although fans of the original SNL may giggle at the heavy screentime devoted to Williams' ex-wife, Claudine Longet. In general, though, I recommend it."
2,"Just a Nearly Identical Copy Of The ""Art Of Orgasm""","You can do ALOT better than this title... all rehashed material that you can easily get on this site for HALF the price from a different and BETTTER Productionn Company with about *101* more techniques.,.. =-) If Dr. Buckley wants to ""Help"" people, then perhaps she may wish to consider including some genuine SUBSTANCE in these videos, instead of simply going for fast and easy big bucks."
4,Good primer to survey research,This survey kit has valuable information that will be useful in creating my survey for my dissertation.
5,michelle breaks new ground!,"if you have known of michelle malone for a while, this cd is probably going to shock you (in a good way). this isn't homegrown, beneath the devil moon, or even hello out there. this is different. as always, malone's powerful voice is the centerpiece. her superb songwriting just keeps on getting better. but this time, accompanying her is a full band (the lowdown georgia revue). as usual, she has some very special guest vocals (and mandolin) by none other than amy ray and emily saliers (indigo girls). basically, this is a different, more rockin' michelle malone. but what makes michelle malone, well, michelle malone, is still there -- the amazing and inspiring lyrics and of course *that* voice. this is also michelle's first album on daemon since her band de soleil days.linda bolley, michelle's drummer is the BEST drummer out there. seriously.watch for michelle's tour to come to a town near you. you MUST hear her live!"
4,Good flick,Such a great price for this box set couldn't pass it up! A must have for your collection!
5,Eddie Murphie's BEST!,"Three of the funniest action movies ever made...and all together for one GREAT price! Fast paced storylines keep you perked while Eddie Murphy goofs on the Beverly Hills Police all the way! BHC II has a hilarious cameo by Gilbert Godfreid that shouldn't be missed! Bronson Pinchot as ""Serge"" (pronounced Sairge not Surge) in the 1st and 3rd installments provides some of the most quotable lines of the movies. All three are action packed and the only negative is that with all three in the same box, it's hard to choose which one to watch!"
5,Beverly Hills Cop,"A Dream come true, I always wanted this box set the dvd's have all the behind the scene stuff, directors takes etc.just greati am an eddie murphy fan anyways"
4,"Beverly Hills Cop Collection (Beverly Hills Cop / Beverly Hills Cop II, Beverly Hills Cop III) DVDs","THE classic Eddie Murphy movies. I know - number 2 wasn't as good as number 1, and number 3 was pretty silly in a lot of ways, but all showcase the humor of Eddie Murphy. If you only want the best one, then buy a single disc with the original movie only.These discs have a good picture and good sound, especially important for the fabulous music."
1,comedy,"murphy is not bad in some of his films, but should have stuck to comedy. some commercials are more entertaining."
2,egh,these films simply don't stand the test of time. watching the first one i was stunned it made the amount of money at the box office that it did. im a huge tony scott fan and found the sequel almost unwatchable. i enjoyed the third film most and that was pretty bad. 48 hrs and its sequel are much better than this franchise.
5,Beverly Hills Cop Collection,I have loved these Eddie Murphy movies and the movie soundtrack ever since the very first time I saw them and even owned them on VHS but since VHS movies are a thing of the past I had to buy these in the DVD and/or Blue Ray format which I did and still love this collection today and always will.
5,Love it,We love watching these movies at home. They never get old and I can't wait to watch them over and over again.
5,Biscuit,"I recently watched the Beverly Hills Cop series and realized how funny it was. I just had to add these movies to my collection. Eddie Murphy plays a smart-ass cop from Detroit who ends up in Beverly Hills, California trying to capture the criminals who murdered his friend. Even though he's a pain-in-the-butt police officer, who ends up getting the help from two other cops that ends in the capture of the bad guys and developing friendship amoung the officers. If you want pure entertainment and laughs, this collection is for you!Beverly Hills Cop Collection (Beverly Hills Cop / Beverly Hills Cop II / Beverly Hills Cop III)"
3,Good series,Beverly hills cop is one of my favorite movies. The first and second followed threw with the theme. But the third was a disappointment.
5,"Exactly as advertised, worked great","My boss does Karaoke, and needed a train whistle for one of the songs he does regularly. I got him this one, and it works perfectly. Good quality, on key, and sounds the way it should."
4,I like it,"Good quality, but rather difficult for my 2 1/2 yr old grandson.It's well made, but bulkier than I anticipated. Am thinking that it's really geared for children older than five.Sure does sound like a train!!!"
5,A whistle to love,I purchased this whistle for my 3-year old grandson's birthday. He is quite a fan of trains and was thrilled that it sounded like a real train. (His parents were thrilled that the sound was not loud and has a pleasant low tone!) It is very well made and I highly recommend it.
4,Tactical Gloves,"I've used the gloves for everything from weightlifting to shooting to boxing. They have a very good fit and feel. They are not designed for weightlifting due to the padding being on the outside. However, I needed a single glove for many activities and these work. The stitching on the little finger and padding over the metacarpals began to loosen. It was easy to fix with a leather needle and some black sinew which doubles the strength. In all fairness, the gloves have been saturated in perspiration and rain many times. Additionally, I applied a leather conditioner daily and over-softened the material. For my next pair, I will spray on a waterproofing agent, double sew the places with most wear, and cut back on the leather conditioner."
4,good enough,This shovel is a little bit small.Not near as large as a regular grain scoop.Its well made and perfect for my intended use.I think it will be very handy around the yard.
1,Boring,"Boring!!!! gratuitous sex. waste of time. and waste of energy. even writing this,is,waste of time...why do i need,to write so much?one word...boring..was enough."
2,"Dynamic writing style, lousy characters and plot","The first third of this book was innovative and a fun read. Then it began a downward spiral of ridiculous plot and unlikeable characters. Yes, Claire was self-aborbed, grieving, etc., but then she just became rather sick and stupid. I finished it hoping for some change which never appeared. The author had a good storyline, jauntily descriptive writing style, but the characters kidnapped her story and took it for a sorry joy ride."
2,Terrible!,"The only reason I did not give this book one star is because the beginning of it was very well-written. Had the tone and pacing remained the same, it could have been great. However, the middle and end of the book were atrocious! The author was attempting to wax philosophic in a gritty, detatched voice, but merely succeeded in writing a story completely devoid of plot or purpose. I agree with the reviewer who said that mothers who had lost a child would find this book insulting. Yes, everyone deals with loss in different ways, but bedding a teenager AND his father as a means to heal the pain is just disturbing. I kept hoping there was a padded room and a straight jacket waiting for her at the end of the book. I would have been satisfied if she'd ended up with a prescription for Xanax; after reading this book I feel like I need one!"
2,Breast seller?,"First Elizabeth Wurtzel's BITCH, now this. If there's a topless woman on the cover, it must be good, right? Anyway, Zeidner is too talented to wholly dismiss; there are many fine passages of physical description (credit cards, room service trays), particularly in the opening pages. But finally we're left with a contrived tale, spun out for far too long, whose point almost seems to be: how naughty can Clare be and still get away with it? She stops seeming ""transgressive"" (or ""newly bold,"" yes we get the joke about the name) and just comes off as a selfish deadbeat. Don't believe me? What if I take my shirt off?"
1,"Boring, implausible plot, revolting characters.","Zeidner spins a yawn: this book is really boring. Also, the characters are so repellent that I don't care what happens to them, but I wish them the worst. Is there anyone else out there who found the plot implausible? So many empty rooms! Such an empty book!"
1,"Want good or great ""chick lit""? Stick with Jane Austen.","This was my first look into the increasingly popular ""chick lit"" fiction arena. It's also become my last, because this was one terrible book. Words fail to describe, and I can't bring myself to recall the dull, lifeless, insipid text.Should I allow one bad reading experience to keep me from the genre? Perhaps, if you consider the praise heaped on this clunker! Instead, if you're into semi-fictional accounts of women, adolescent or otherwise, stick with Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott. They are referred to as ""classics"" for all the best reasons."
1,Makes human sex less exciting than plant intercourse,"The book would have you think that the death of a child exonerates the promiscuity of the mother. I can interpret the logic of ""Layover"" in no other way. I would prefer honest porn that pretends to be nothing more than it is to this tawdry tale that attempts to surround human vileness with an aura of profundity. ""Layover"" has depth that is only virtual. Dive into this book's ""deep"" end and you risk hurting yourself. It is much more likely, however, that the reader will discover this book on the floor in the morning and have no recollection of how it got there."
2,Don't let the sexy cover fool you.,"A friend recommended this, and when I saw the sexy cover, I thought, excellent -- I'm in for a wild ride. But this is high-brow chick-lit, without many surprises, and left me unsatisfied. It's a tale of self-discovery, sure, but at the end I felt it was a weak discovery. I wish I could get away from my life of material comfort, job prosperity, and surgeon spouse, only to realize that, hey, maybe my life ain't so bad afterall. Still, it's well written and moves quickly. I finished it in a couple of nights. But I wish it had gone deeper into the darkside of grief. I wouldn't call this self-destructive behavior. I mean, how bad can things get when you're staying at the Four Seasons (as this character does for most of the book)?"
2,Big disappointment,The book was a big disappointment. It has some good writing but some boring sections too. I couldn't believe in the character. I didn't like her either. What mother who loses a young child waits 5 years and then goes off sneaking into hotels and sleeping with perfect strangers? Didn't ring true.
2,Average at best.,"Sorry, but this has all the trappings of the Erica Jong School of Fiction: a marriage in trouble, a wife on the edge, overprecious description, reconciliation at the end with a too-stable but lovable husband..been there, done that."
5,Hole Up in Your Apartment,"This is the kind of book you read when you've gotten to a point of loneliness that you can't seem to reconcile. It's not sad, really. But it does speak to that part of ourselves that wants to be on the edge, without going completely overboard. It details that point in your life when you know that you're just about to lose it--or you'd really like to be able to--but somehow you know, somewhere deep down, that although things will eventually be okay, you want to be able to explore just what ""losing it"" really means. Just for a little while, anyway. And then you can go back to being your presentable self."
2,Major disappointment,"Although the quality of the writing at the beginning of this book was sufficient for me to buy it, I was left cold. It is a story of a middle-aged woman feeling despondent about the loss of a child (it's not clear how long in the past) and susequent one-time infidelity of her husband, who acts out by remaining away from home and engaging sexually with just about anybody in sight. Yes, some might be titillated by the frequent use of sexual terms, and I will admit that I like the author's style, but the book failed to go anywhere--It has no beginning, no crisis and a highly predictable outcome. If it were much longer than 268 pages, I'm certain I would not have finished this book. There are MANY books more worthy of one's time."
1,it takes precious little,"it seems, to get a book published these days. My guess is that 50% of the people who purchased this book did so because of the partly exposed boob on the cover. I know that there are books that are meant to be taken to the beach or the mountains for summer vacation and then left at the rental house because to bring it home would mean more weight in the car and lower gas mileage. But if the reader struggles to get through the first 30 pages of truly uninspired writing more than once, something is seriously wrong. At least if Ms. Zeidner could write, it might redeem the ridiculous ""plot"" line. Even the sex, which presumably enticed a number of people to buy the book is unexciting. The dust jacket says that the author is a professor of English at a respected university; one can only hope that she is a much better teacher than she is a writer."
2,Waste of money,The board is small and overpriced. Too lazy to send it back. The kid can barely put the whole alphabet on it. So its frustrating to the child and parent. Hardly worth 10.00 bucks!
1,My HP dv9230us is in the shop for repair,"I ordered my new dv9230us with high hopes from Amazon on 2/7/07, received it on 2/9/07 and put it in an official HP authorized repair shop at Circuit City on 02/11/07 where it has been to date! The problem is that the Intel PRO wireless LAN 3945ABG works intermittently. The repair shop replaced the Wi-Fi card and the computer still does the same thing. The repair shop repairman advised me that the motherboard interface with the Wi-Fi card is defective and he will now ship the computer to an official HP repair facility. I requested a new computer or my money back but HP has not responded. I can't find out Amazon's return policy for returning a defective computer on their website and a telephone contact number is also elusive? So here I sit with my new computer in the shop and my money gone and have no idea when or what the outcome will be."
1,Faulty Motherboard biting many,"I purchased the DV9230US in March 2007 shortly after it was introduced. My first intro to Vista, which I do not like, but otherwise great. Until!!! May 2008 when the motherboard went out. Cost more to replace than it is worth. Spent $500 on data recovery, and told no problem. Google DV9230 recall and see what you find. Hundreds of the same problem. Last HP I'll ever buy."
1,"Great until it dies, from what I see they all do.","This was a great machine when it ran. Do yourself a favor and do some research on this and the DV series laptops. For starters look up DV9000 hinge crack problem. A lot of these laptops crack on the left hand side and the display becomes very difficult to open. In fact many pieces of broken plastic will come out every time you open the lid once it starts. The best part is that this should happen after your warranty is out and HP is not acknowledging that it is a problem. However it is a problem, yours. But thats not even the best part. The video cards and motherboards are going out on a lot of these and they have a recall out on many of them. But guess what? Not this model and thats what happened to me. HP customer service has been terrible and there lack of taking responsibility for these is terrible. But don't take my word for it, do some research on these laptops and HP's service and make your own choice."
3,Great computer until it breaks ...,"I have had a mixed result with this machine. After a year the hinge mechanism broke, destroying my display and apparently a portion of the motherboard. HP, though I had to massage the situation, replaced the defective parts. After another year the exact ... same ... issue has come around again. Display is artifacting and works sometimes but on very rare occassions. In case this resembles your situation it'll cost $350 to repair this issue.I chalk it up to poor hinge engineering. Overall HP product was pretty nice until it broke and then broke again."
3,Shows great; problems with discs,"The DVDs that work are great. This is a 4 disc set and we had a problem with disk 2 & 4 of our original set. Amazon was wonderful and processed our exchange request. We never received the replacement that was ordered but Amazon was very quick to overnight another replacement which we received. Their return process worked very well. However, I think there may be a production/manufacturing error with disks 2 & 4. Both our original discs 2 & 4 and the replacement discs 2 & 4 had unusual markings and sometimes the video freezes. But we are keeping them anyway."
5,good price,"very fast sharpening stone,faster than water stones, it was my first DMT stone and I'm thinking about getting the extra fine, also I got it at a very good price"
1,"Awful Scratches, No Support from Manufacturer!","I received this ""sharpening plate"" without anything included in it like rubber pads for stability or any use or preparation instructions. The plate is supposed to be extra extra fine. The plate put very ugly 60 grit type scratches in a nice plane iron of mine. I sent a message to DMT Company to see if there was some sharpening plate preparation or anything I had needed to do before using the tool. That was a week ago. I have been completely ignored by DMT Corp. I now have a damaged Lie-Nielsen plane iron and a useless $60 DMT diamond plate. I suggest buyers stay away from DMT products. The plates damage tools and DMT apparently does not support their products!"
1,bad quality :(,"BAD QUALITY, the leather from inside hurts me + the leather from outside is like a plastic!!"
5,Surprisingly comfortable,"I bought the shoes for New Years and they arrrived in plenty of time. My wife and I had decided to ""dress up"" since whe had not done so since our wedding in 1983. We danced the night away and the shoes were surprisely comfortable. The only drawback was that my wife for some reason kept calling me ""the penquin""."
1,broken merchandise,"This telephone cover was DOA--dead on arrival, that is, it is broken. The piece doesn't stay on the phone and it is cracked. It cost too little to worry with returning it but yet I feel had."
3,Sweet&Sour,"Here we are agin with aother volume of The Looney Tunes Golden Collection it's not bad, but it could be better the advantages of it are it has TV specials which I had never seen before up untill now and it allso has the cartoons which feature the early(and funny) Daffy Duck when he was silly rarther then the nasty, greedy Daffy we all know today. The disadvantage is the fact that we again have the FBI like disclamer on the start of every single disc saying these cartoons refelcet the time in which they were made and so on ok WB you said it, we get the point and it's enough there's no need to have it on every single disc!Some of the things I hope to see on future volumea is more Tex Avery(including the cartoons he did at MGM which of course will be on a seperate disc set) Foghorn leghorn and Robert Mckimsons work including the cartoon 'Wild Wife"" among other things.I know Warner Brothers is trying their best to make their fans happy and I will be paitent!"
4,Fun,I got this for my brother for Christmas. I wasn't sure which volume to get so I took a stab in the dark. Hope he likes it!
1,and the Theme of this set is (drumroll please),"Old and Boring. 'nuff said.We really enjoyed the first four collections, but this one felt like Warner was intentionally trying to rip off consumers. They could have tried to include a few funny ones on discs 3 and 4. The first two discs were just kinda funny, but, for the price, not worth our time. Next time I'll believe other negative reviews and pass, if I see the word old or boring."
2,Less Porky pig,I like the color cartoons better. There is a lot of black and white Porky pig in this volume. I should've read the year better I guess.
2,A big disappointment,"Wow - the first two discs were very good. Not fantastic, but very good. The last two discs feature very old plots without the usual characters. The 4th disc out of 4 was ancient - completely black and white.My 6 year-old son laughed at many of the cartoons on the first two discs. I had seen many of these growing up on weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings in the 70's and 80's.The last two discs must be of interest to history buffs, but they are not funny at all to me. I'm only 42, so I guess I am too young to enjoy a lot of that really early stuff.No Foghorn Leghorn, no Wile E, no Road Runner. I received it as a gift from my mother for Christmas, but I am sure she would be disappointed, thinking it had more that I'd like to see on it.Guess I'll look at the spotlight collection. Perhaps it isn't so archaic."
4,"Classic cartoons, you can't beat them.","This classic lonney tunes cartoon that featured Bugs Bunny and others is without a doubt some of the best cartoons of all time. Weather it was Bugs outsmarting Elmer Fudd by his opening trademark line ""Whats up Doc?"" or watching Foghorn Legghorn hit that dog with a piece of plywood all of them are really funny, a must have."
1,Stop Trying to fool us Warners.....,"Do not let the tag lines fool you, These DVDs have been going down in quality since about volume 2, the extras are really lame and recycle interviews already seen, and the price alone will make your wallet hurt.Boycott this."
5,LOONEY TUNES SATISFACTION,"Item was as advertised and was shipped promptly and arrived in time for Christmas, as it was a gift to my grandchildren. The price was the the lowest that I found anywhere and with the free shipping.....how can you beat it. And the best part is, my grandchildren love it and it is something from my youth that I get to share with them and to enrich their lives. Our favorite and the reason I purchased this particular collection was for the cartoon the ""Bashful Buzzard"". I could not be more pleased."
3,Very quick overview of Washington History,"My husband and I bought this book thinking we would learn more about Washington State. Having lived here 6 years, we thought we should at least know the history of the place. While it does cover historical occurences, they are far too brief and there is very little detail. Chronologically ordered, the stories jump back and forth all over the state, so you get no coherent idea of development within a certain region. It is a very thin book and a very quick read, so if you're simply looking for an overview of events in Washington State, this is your book. If you were hoping for in depth, you'll have to look elsewhere."
3,Great overview but few Russian sources,"Mitcham does a far better job on the obvious areas of the Ostfront, and actually covers some issues that carry into 1945. His sources are far more German oriented than Russian, and that always brings balance issues into the picture. He pays little attention to Hitler's dismissal of von Manstein and teh underlying reasons for that strange decision. The real annoyance is that a book about East Front that was published in 2001 used mostly German sources when more and more Soviet era sources are available."
3,what about Soviet side?,"Although I enjoyed reading Professor Mitcham's book .I couldn't get rid of the assmution that Pr.Mitcham actually favors German Army while I was reading the book . There aren't any doubt that German Army was one of the most effctive war machines in Entire military history and German Landser's bravery was undoubtable but Final victors were Russian's and I doubt that Russians victory was completey derived from their babarity,ruthlessness and sheer numbers.moreover Pr Mitcham didn't even use Pr. Erickson's""Road to Berlin ""as his book's sources ..there aren't any resources about soviet side in Bibilography.It's quite dissapointing to read the book which is biased"
2,Crumbling Empire...Crumbled History,"Mr Mitcham omits facts and misleads his readers.One example is the number of soldiers in a Russian Division in 1944 and their quality. Crumbling Empire is almost a carbon copy of the title put out by former Nazi's who assert that they would have won except the Russians out-numbered us and we had Hitler. To Simplistic and biased. The author is not a Nazi, but a serious Russian Hater, ""The Reds"". Mr Mitcham says that a large number of German POWs were were turned over to the Partisans and put to death in horrible ways. Paul Adair says something of the same thing except he says it was German officers who said this. There is no mention of the Germam Army's complicity in millions of deaths of Jews, Russian POWs, alledged partisans, men women & children, deliberately murdered directly in the case of the Jews and indirectly buy the German Army stealing their food, and putting them out of their houses in the dead of Winter. Misleading,and Biased, not good history"
2,"No Detail, Anti-German Bias","If you are looking for a book that goes into any detail at all of the German East Front disasters of 1944, look elsewhere. This book is primarily a series of long slams of the German commanders of various sections of the front, followed by the briefest of sketchy descriptions of the fighting in their areas."
2,not bad sheets,"There is a reason why there are Italian thread count and these are not. Not bad sheets, but should not be rated at 420tc."
2,Comparatively Disappointing,"I am a big fan of almost all ""String Quartet Tribute to -"" 's, but this one is an exception. The arrangements are rather poor and on some tracks, the instruments are slightly out of tune - which is really distracting. They add a set of bongos / congos into the mix, and it feels really foreign and out of place. As much as I love this genre and Iron Maiden, this tribute really does justice to neither."
1,mixed review,"I'm calling this a mixed review because if you have ANY musical taste, sense, feel or respect this CD is a complete joke.However, if you are looking for a gag gift or a white elephant present for Christmas, it doesn't get much better than this!"
5,DMT Rocks! (no pun intended),"Typical outstanding DMT product. Cut's very fast. DMT is a no BS company. As usual, you get what you pay for.The D8C even made my less expensive Norton's useable for straight razor's. IMO, that say's something-- Norton's are an reliable stone but they certainly DO NOT ship smooth and flat."
2,Would not recommend.,Bought the 3-piece set recently. The surface has a few spots that are high and my chisels keep catching on them ruining the edge. Expected more for so much money.
4,I use it to flatten my water stones,"I bought this DMT D8C on the purpose to flatten my water stones. Own a few DMT's stones, like the fine and extra fine whetstone, and I feel I still like to sharpen my plane iron and chisels on water stone vs diamond plate.With the water stone, I need something to flatten them, I found the D8C's continuous surface leaves smoother suface on my 8000 grit water store. The other type tend to leave stripes, guess that because the diamonds are separated by those plastic circles.Oh, this one is so much heavier than I thought (at 2.7lbs), feels like a whole piece of steel."
3,Not in the same league as Wusthof,"I have a Wusthof 7"" Santoku and love it so I thought I'd save a few bucks and get a 5"" Calphalon. What a mistake! It can't be made to be as sharp as the Wusthof and it rusts! I recommend you save up your pennies and get a good Wusthof instead of this mediocre knife."
4,Very nice...,"We have the longer 7"" Santoku by Wustoff and we decided to try this smaller version. It is a great knife with a good edge. We love using it. It is also well made and nicely balanced."
1,Dangerously Defective product,"This was an okay, not too impressive knife for about 1 year. Then one day the handle simply snapped off near the base of the blade as I was chopping celery, sending the blade flying up at me and bouncing off my chest. I've had other knives last years and years of much heavier use than this knife ever saw and have never had a knife simply snap in normal daily use like this did. (I never abused this knife, so improper use is not the culprit here.)"
1,Handle Snapped!,"My wife and I received this exact same knife from Calphalon for registering for their products. After one year, the handle snapped while my wife was slicing food, and she wasn't even pushing down very hard at all. Luckily, she was not harmed. Calphalon does offer a warranty for this item, but we are not interested in a replacement and will no longer be purchasing their products.This knife is extremely unsafe. DO NOT PURCHASE!!!"
2,Rotten Ending,"We were excited for this newest Veggie Tales movie because it's geared toward girls. We've really enjoyed ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything"" and had similar expectations for ""Princess and the Pop Star."" Unfortunately, the story just wasn't very cohesive -- they really tried to fit too much into a short time -- and the ending in particular left something to be desired with one girl (named Princess) failing to realize the error of her ways until her little brother found his wee vegetable self in a perilous situation that she rescued him from. The jokes weren't there, the religious subtext was overly preachy, and the songs weren't as catchy as those in Pirates. Even my little girl didn't care for this video."
4,Fun and Valuable Lesson,"We love VeggieTales and is always exciting to see what they come out with next. Having two daughters it is great to have a girlie episode every once in a while. The Princess and the Popstar is a great colorful story with fun new music. A ""freaky friday"", ""grass is always greener..."", and ""the prince and the paulper"" story to show these two girls that they are better in their own lives just as God created them. Already my toddler has requested we watch it multiple times. So glad she enjoys something of worth."
1,Title is misleading!It doesn't teach phrases as used by Deaf,"If you are expecting to sign phrases as the Deaf use (i.e. American Sign Language), this book is NOT for you. Some places in the book did not list the approiate sign for that context. This reviewer would recomend staying away from this book as it presents Pidgen Sign English but too often with the wrong sign."
1,very disappointing,I make puppets myself and want to learn more how to make them come alive. As I live abroad I was impatient to start reading the book. As it finally arrived and read it I can only say how disappointed I was at the low level of ideas that are described in the first 120 p of the book. I guess nothing 'new' only logical. Pity. I don't enjoy writing a negative review. I only wish it had given me 'more'.
3,I would when or if it arrives!,"The book probably is very informative but as I have been waitingsince I ordered this book on the 6th October 2011 and Amazon did not dispatch it until the 26th October 2011 10 days later, I have yet still to receive it, so at present I cannot comment!So this is a review of Amazon's service!Why does it take so long for Amazon to dispatch goods after you have ordered it?How come I can order goods from around the other side of the world at the same time I order from Amazon and receive it weeks before I receive my Amazon order? Maybe Amazon needs to look at their customer service quality"
1,Don't waste your money....terrible customer service,Don't waste your money on this watch by Invicta....quit working after 1 month and then was at the repair facility for 3 months and it still doesn't work.
4,if you like tori amos you will like minnie,this is the second time I bought this album. I lost the original in a house fire and I like it so much I had to replace it.
4,Very Impressive...,"Very impressive, but I'm not surprised, since she started off in music. So this is a return to her roots. I heard ""Deeper Water"" on Sirius TV Satellite Smooth Electronica/Chill station, and was very impressed with her singing skills along with her lyrics she sings. I have since heard it in whole at a listening station (still need to buy it), and she belongs in the ranks of female musicians like Tori Amos, Bjork, Cat Power, Jolie Holland, etc. Another reason I'm not surprised, is that she is a fine actress as well. So if you're a fan of singer/songwriting females, pick this cd up, it's in the top of the ranks. - DJ Dakini-NYC aka Savannah Skye..."
5,I am not good at reviews but here goes...,"Pleasent, slow paced, and good for relaxing. All songs save one were written by Minnie. I wonder if she wrote the excellent acoustic/electric arrangements. I love Minnie's voice and her songs. This CD will replace my all time favorite romance CD--James Galway's Nocturne."
3,"Great Voice, Pallid Songs","I've always loved good ole Minnie as an actress, and it's really lovely to hear her voice. I just hope this album does well enough to merit a return to the studio, where Minnie then can select songs on which to hang her vocal talents. This album is, frankly, too bland (of course, you never know -- that might just attract a wide audience!) ... but based on her voice, Minnie deserves another try for musical success.Kinda like her movie career: likeable in so many roles, but not compelling enough to grab top billing except in minor films like (the wonderfully-romantic) ""Return to Me."""
3,I shoulda listened better . . .,"I should have paid better attention to the reviewers who said this was only a so-so album. Over-produced for my taste (I want to hear the singer, not the musicians). This happens way too often--why can't these guys just let the girls sing? Minnie has potential but should choose her songs and support staff more carefully. The Springsteen cover is without energy."
4,She has a lot in her POCKET!!!!,"When I first heard that Minnie Driver was going to be recording an album, I was hesitant. So many movie stars are starting to turn to singing........but when I heard clips her album, I was highly impressed by her smoky lounge type voice. I dissagree completely with the reviewer who stated that the songs are forgettable and just pleasant. Pleasant is what Ms. Driver was going for and she succeeded! She wanted an album that flowed well together with great lyrics and vocals and she did just that. It is an album that is great to drive home to after a long day or to listen to while curled up at home....it is an impressive debut by a very promising artist! 10 songs she wrote and 1 song is a remake of Bruce Springsteen's HUNGRY HEART which is simple and gorgeous!"
4,Finally someone breaks the actress/singer stereotype,I heard a song in a restaurant and liked it so much I asked the waitress. She didn't know and finally someone told us it was Minnie Driver. Nobody believed her. Then I went home and listened to a few songs on iTunes and they were all good. So I bought the album and have been very surprised. She's a good actress; she's a great singer.
5,Love it!,"I bought this CD on a whim and I could not have been happier with the result. I listen to it on a daily basis almost and even my 13 year old requests it, so is must not be untolerable. I hope Ms.Driver will be able to grace us with another release in the future."
4,Everything I've got in my pocket,"A pretty good CD. I really enjoy the title song as well as a few others, but I was not impressed with some songs including the bruce springsteen remake. I would recommend it for the listener trying to find a voice that is enchanting and different than what is currently available in music today"
4,The bag is OK.,I cannot tell how good a bag is. This bag can just satisfy my requirement so I think it is good. I need to carry my book to the campus and sometimes the laptop. It can hold my mp3 too. I think the design of it is good enough for me.
3,Good.,"Lots of great material packed in this study...also, lots of questions and not agreeing with author on some subjects. Overall, though, can be terrific for a group of Christians that are willing to study, question the text and then study further."
3,No MyWritingLab :(,The book was fine and everything but I needed the MyWritingLab code as well which I didnt get.
3,Harsh industrial akin to Suicide Commando/Android Lust,"Novakill is harsh-industrial using distorted vocals. The music is purely electronic...usually with a slow, hard pounding bass-line through most of the songs. Most of the lyrics on Hard Tech For A Hard World tend to be typical for this type of band as well, with futuristic themes about rampant technology, ect. Truthfully, there's really nothing that sets them apart from the more well known bands in the genre, but that could be their key to success. Fans of Suicide Commando, Android Lust, and Decoded Feedback will eat this one up. The only real flaws with the album are the low-quality sound and their tendency to use annoying samples (I'm getting tired of hearing lines from The Matrix already). Ultimately though, this is a decent debut album for the band, and a good choice for industrial/ebm fans looking for something cold and angry."
2,Only die-hard fans.....,".... of Miss Stafford need apply. As is hinted in another review, Scots may take exception to the liberties taken with the words: I do. Burns wrote them (""John Anderson"", ""A red, red rose"") the way he did - leave them alone. And ""Auld Lang Zyne"" (sic) always grates. The whole thing is too lush and schmaltzy and apt to turn ex-pat Scots into blubbering wrecks."
1,Puhleeese!,"This is a more or less verbatim rendering of her diary and a deadly boring read. All her visits to friends are detailed. This might be nice in a letter to mutual friends but the fact that the Grahams were moving from Ghost Ranch to Durango or that ""Barbara and her husband were contemplating a divorce"" is not of interest to me.And then there are the teasers that turn out to be dead ends, for example, ""I had never been to Crested Butte and just loved the name. Sure enough, the road was marked. We headed down a hill and past an interesting guest ranch. About three blocks later, the pavement ended. Nothing but gravel. I wasn't sure Tessie (the nickname of her vehicle) was ready for 20 miles of mountainous gravel road, nor did I feel I was ready to tackle it either. We turned around and went back to Route 133 which led us north through beautiful country. The weather was great..."" ..."
3,Slow cooling,"I am using this seat cover now for more than three weeks in recently very hot South Alabama, but the cooling effect is very marginal at best. When my car is parked in the hot sun all day it takes 15 or more minutes to feel any very minimal cooling at all.I also installed a 12V timing relay that turns on the seat cover automatically about 15 minutes before I leave work in the afternoon (my working hours are very regular) but the cooling is barely noticible.So when it's very hot and you need the cooling most you will not get much.The item itself is functioning so far and seems to be reasonably well made.All in all a good cloth regular seat cover will probably work just as well to cover burning hot leather seats in the suumer."
1,Cooling Function Does Not Work Well,"We have never tried the heating partion of this product, but I purchased it for my hot-natured husband who was spending long periods of time in an un-air conditioned truck. The product provided no relief. I now understand why there are plent of these labeled as 'gently used' on auction sites. This was a total waste of money for us."
4,"Nice, Built Solid.","I have been using these extentions for a couple jobs now and I think they are great, I have the 6"" and 12"" extentions and both are very durable, and seem like they will last a long time. They are extremely quick-loading, you just stick the bit in the end and it locks in automatically. The only thing that I have found to be a problem is the way you unlock the bits, you have to pull back the ""Head"" of the extention, and when you are drilling through material you might accidentally hit the head and unlock the bit. I wish there was a way to better lock the bit in."
5,good extension,I bought the 6 and 12 inch extensions and the both work great. They lock down nicely. The heads are a little large but a small price to pay for a tool that should last a lifetime. It feels solid and spins smoothly in my drill.
1,Garbage,"I work in sheet metal hvac and I use these all the time.. they come in handy. So I decided to purchase this one and the first day I used it the end where shanks insert just blew apart, I do use an impact gun on all my shanks and this never happened. The way they made this is not very good. The very top is not secured down well enough, you can easily take a hammer and tap the thing apart. I would recommend finding a different brand. Never had a problem with Irwin."
2,Not worth it,We received this as a gift and didn't like it at all. My two year old used it for about a day. But it doesn't go very far with the remote (you can't just have it move across the floor) and it's VERY noisy! If it is walked away from you can hear it in the other room still making an annoying noise. I'd go with something else if you're looking for a first remote control car
1,Worst Toy Ever!,I purchased this car for my 2 year old son for Christmas. Shame on me for not taking it out of the box and testing it out prior to Christmas morning. The car lights up and makes sounds (very annoying) but didn't move an inch. I replaced all batteries - still no movement. The manufacturer was of no help. Thank god someone else also got him the Chicco remote control car - because it works!Steer clear of this stinker.
1,Works for 2 days and then breaks,"My son received this as a Christmas gift last year. It was fun while it was working, which was 2 days. It makes a bunch of noise but doesn't move an inch. I replaced all the batteries and still the same result. This toy is probably the worst built toy I have ever encountered."
1,Horrible noisy car,"This car should not be given to little kids. It is too noisy when turned on and it has to be left on in order to use the remote control... which means that the child has to hear the horrible buzzing sound the whole time he is playing with it. My son hates the sound. It has to be turned on and off with a little switch at the bottom. At 14 months my son is not able to do that because the switch is almost invisible to a little child.The remote control is also poorly designed. There is one button that does everything... it moves the car forward and turn it around in all directions. It is extremely sensitive. Even my husband and I were not able to move the car in the direction we wanted... I can't even imagine a little child doing that.I am returning it to Target. The only reason I bought it because it said ""Award Winner"" on the box. I don't know what award they are talking of. I wonder who in their right mind would give this toy an award."
3,Cute but loud,"My son got this when he was a year old. He was scared of it at first because it's really loud. It makes constant engine sounds and beeping when it's turning. My husband put clear packing tape over the speaker and it was still fairly loud, especially on hard floors. It worked well on our carpet though and was slighly quieter.I wish it had an automatic shutoff though, because the engine sounds go on forever if you don't shut it off, and a one year old doesn't do that on his own when he's done playing with it.He didn't figure out the button very well to make it go where he wanted on his own, but he still enjoyed it anyway."
4,Best R/C Car,"My son got this for his first birthday. As he is the youngest son, we'd tried all kinds of remote control vehicles and hadn't had much luck with any of them. He is now four and a half and this car is still going strong.This car requires the push of one button: push once and the car goes forward; push twice and the car spins in a circle. Thus making it easy for toddlers to send it where they want. The batteries don't run down really fast, so that's a bonus.But. It is loud. So if you or your child are sensitive to loud, high-pitched noises, this isn't for you.All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone in the market for an R/C car and I would purchase another one if this thing broke tomorrow."
4,Noisy but fun!,"My son got this last Christmas when he was 10 months old. He was too young then to use the remote but enjoyed chasing it around the room while we moved it. By the time he was 1, he figured out that he could move it by pushing the button. Now he's 21 months old and still loves this car!We never had any problems with the remote or the car not working. Major con though: THE SOUND! Oh my god the noise!!! LOL After 2 days, my husband took it apart and cut the speaker wires. Problem solved! :-)"
4,Great toy!,"My almost 1 year old is obsessed with this car. ""Ca"" is his first word because he loves it so much. When he first got it for Christmas he was afraid of it, but after a week or so, he conquered his fear and now it is his absolute favorite. Nothing keeps him entertained longer. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the annoying loud noise. A little tape helps tone it down."
1,Bummer,"This was a Christmas gift for our 18 month old son and we were excited about it. As other reviews have stated, there was no battery for the remote included, so we couldn't use it until we went out and purchased one. It worked great for a few hours, then the car barely moved forward or back and didn't spin anymore. We changed out all the batteries with no success. It didn't suffer any damage - no dropping or crashing, so we are at a loss as to what happened. It's a bummer because despite being annoyingly loud (we postage taped a folded tissue to the speaker which greatly helped with the noise) our son and 3 year old daughter really enjoyed playing with this toy. From previous reviews, I'm guessing that contacting Battat will be to no avail."
2,Way too loud!!,This car is so loud! It actually scares my son. He cries whenever he sees it. We put tape over the speaker holes and that helped a little but seriously save your money and don't buy this toy.
2,"For Pete's sake, what's all that racket?","This is a very durable, very easy to use car - perfect for a toddler. Good size, and easy to hold remote control. Sounds great, right? Sure, if you can stomach the noise, which is AWFUL and cannot be turned down or off. Save yourselves, run far, run fast - don't buy this product."
2,It's missing a feature,"We got this as a Christmas present. I figured it would be perfect for an 18 month old - one button and that's it. Well, he has fun with it, and the range is decent, but there is one major feature missing. It doesn't automatically turn itself off, unlike most toys made today.It really is quite an annoying thing for it not to turn itself off. It wouldn't be so bad, if when the car was ""idling"" it didn't make noise, but it makes the exact same noise as it does when you push the little test button on the top of the car. Total bummer. Besides that, my son loves his little car."
2,Worthless,"Very disappointing. Purchased for Christmas a year ago. Worked ok short range (i.e., less than 5 feet), and easy for 2-year-old to use, but then RC seemed to stop functioning altogether. Replaced all batteries but to no avail."
3,Seems okay for a 2 year old,"The car makes noise starting from the time you turn the switch on. It's not as loud as some of the reviews would have you believe, but it's probably too much for a 1 year old, or even an 18 month old. We just got one as a gift for my son, who is 26 months old. It seems okay for him at his current age. If he had received it only 6 months ago, he might have been afraid of it. It definitely would not work for a child with sensory hearing issues. The sound is not a bad feature, because I can find it and turn it off when he's done playing if he's hidden it somewhere, as he likes to do. We'll see how it wears over time, but I don't expect it to have a very long life."
2,Nope,"If you're looking for the old fashioned, scrapbook look, look elsewhere.This looks like black duct tape across the corner of your photo.You may like it. We did not."
5,Who's playing along with him? - no info on your albums??,Who's playing along with him? - no info on your albums?
1,not happy,"disappointed. the picture makes it seem that my xbox 360 aracade would be covered seamlessly...but it's not. wanted to add a little interesting flare to my old console, now i think i've gone and made a mistake...don't buy this item."
4,Geography Illuminates Scripture,"It's been a pleasant surprise to see how a knowledge of the geography of Palestine can illuminate the biblical text. There is context here about why certain events in the Bible happened where they did, and how biblical locations correspond to the modern map of the world. Some history too.Downside is that quality of the pictures isn't that great--not very clear."
3,Kindle Version,"I am a Bible school teacher in Johannesburg, South Africa and when I read the reviews on this book I just had to have it. Since I live in South Africa and am a Kindle for Mac user, I bought the Kindle version as it is easier and quicker to get a hold of.I am very happy and impressed with my purchase except for one important fact: this book is based mostly on visual material, and I'm sure it is wonderful in the paperback format, but the Kindle version shows very small images which are difficult to read. When one zooms in on the images, almost all resolution is lost and the text cannot be read at all.Please let me know how I can acquire higher resolution versions of these images or is it possible to get a refund for this Kindle book or have the paperback mailed to me in South Africa?"
4,scholarly but fundamentalist,Great reasource with easy to read maps and cultural references. Approach at times was more fundamentalist than the way I interpret the Bible but I found it interesting to read certain passages from that perspective. Should be considered for any complete Bible bookshelf.
2,not worth it,"I've been unimpressed with these. First of all, they are SUPER stiff and scratchy. Maybe it's because we're used to the Pure and Naturals (which are AMAZING!) but they just seem uncomfortable. Even when they're full they seem pretty inflexible. And we've had multiple leaks with them. What worked better for us was buying the Pure and Naturals in the next size up. They seemed to hold just as much liquid, and are softer and more flexible to boot."
2,Don't Work for Us,These leak about 60-70% of the time for us. Most mornings my son wakes up with wet pajamas from leaks. I'm going to have to find some new overnight diapers.
3,Mind stretching concepts.,"Although one of Les Brown's comments has been disproved in recent years regarding the pyramids holding the graves of the Egyptian kings, the rest of the book is awesome. Has anybody besides Les tried this greenhouse style? His observation that he could not make compost in the pyramid (it would not de-compose), and the egg drying/reconstituting experiment are almost spooky. I have to build one of these!"
2,What you really need to keep the notebook cool is ventilation,"I bought this because I believed all the crap about the gel dissipating the heat better. However, the bottom of the pad cannot dissipate any heat because of its thickness. The top of the pad is where the laptop is so there is nowhere for the heat to escape. It will only prevent your lap/thighs from getting hot.In my experience using it with my macbook pro 15 inch, the laptop temperatures were not affected at all!Also, the white surface where the laptop is supposed to go, is extremely slippery. So the laptop will slide off the mat, which is a huge downside.So believe me, and do not buy this 'notebook cooler'"
3,Good for those with interest in math to start,"I thought this a good book that showed how math is valuable in the real world. The author tries to avoid reading like a text book to try and make math come alive. He is moderately successful, but it is hard not to have some mathy jargon and notation, which I think will discourage those who don't have some motivation to think about math to start with. Overall a good book and I will try to read his first book if I get a chance."
5,good book,"Peter liked to draw. He wanted to keep his pictures but they always got thrown away, wiped away, washed away.... until his father comes up with the perfect solution.This is the favorite book of my two-year-old son. I remember loving it as a child too. It is heartwarming to see the parents listening to their son's concerns and helping him with his frustration. A sweet story; not a classic and not filled with underlying meaning, but just a nice simple story."
5,Almost too good.,"This book explains so many amazing techniques, I want to hide every copy that I can find at the bookstores. The only thing I don't get is Scott Kelby's misunderstanding of how things reflect. Scott needs to take some photographs of actual reflected objects and take some notes. Other than that, this is my absolute favorite Photoshop book out of 3 that I own. By the way, Photoshop 7 Down & Dirty Tricks has almost all new tricks. Seriously worth a look."
4,Follow the bouncing ball,"Scott Kelby is no doubt a well rounded expert in the graphic arts, and photoshop. Whether your interest lies in advertising, photography, web publication, or design, Scott's got it covered here in this book. Nifty little tricks you've already seen in media and wondered ""How did they do that"" are covered here. Step by step it's easy to follow, making each step very clear. Some knowledge of Photoshop may be required, but only just to understand ""why"" these little niffty tricks work. Think you've seen it all? What to be amused by what you can do with Photoshop? Scott's book is for you then. Get it!"
1,VERY shallow and basic - not worth the money,"It's a funny thing - you see all these incredibly good reviews for this book, and then you are confronted with the absolutely useless stuff that parades as ""techniques"" within. This is one of the weakest Photoshop books I've EVER seen - all of the contents of this book are old hat (with the exception of the Photoshop 6 coverage, which is no better than that which comes with the actual program). Worse, I read the Amazon interview with the author, Scott Kelby - this guys admits to basically not having read a single real book in his life. It shows in his writing style, which is grating and adolescent...."
2,Disappointing,"Although you can find some interesting techniques in this book, there's nothing that will absolutely knock your socks off...contrary to what the title indicates. In addition, most of the exercises aren't fully explained, so even an intermediate user has to figure out the extra steps needed to move forward.For the money, this book doesn't even come close to a book like Photoshop 6 Web Magic in terms of the 'Wow' factor and in explicating the steps necessary to complete each project."
1,MAC Lovers Book by a real MAC nerd,"Disappointing is what this book turned out to be. Useless with a PC. The author obviously is a MAC user who understands a few key strokes in the PC but not the interface provided by the software. These are old, basic tricks for anyone who has ever used Photoshop, Photo Paint by Corel or other graphics programs.Definitely a disappointing book. Returned it same day we received it. ..."
1,Public Domain Tricks Recycled,"As a longtime Photoshop user (version 2.0), I remember seeing thefirst issue of Kelby's Photoshop magazine and the birth of hisNational Association of Photoshop Users. Unfortunately, this bookrecycles much content from the magazine's history, and offers littlenew work. Worse, as is common knowledge among most NAPP members, mostof these ""tricks"" have long been available for free on theWeb at various Photoshop tutorial sites built both as a public serviceby designers and those looking to sell banner ad space. Couple thiswith the generally poor printing of the book's color plates, and youshould seriously question purchasing this self-published book,particularly if you're a professional designer. If you've got anInternet connection, save yourself some money and find this stuff forfree with a good search engine."
5,worked great,Used for my Daughter's under the sea themed birthday party. I was able to make really cute lollipops. I used vanilla and chocolate to make a light brown shell look.
1,"Already rusted, missing pieces","We ordered this item, but it was delivered in a box that had obviously been opened before. A few parts were already a little rusted and pieces were missing. We were unable to put it together as instructed. BUT the company was more than willing to accept the item for return and processed our refund quickly. We are happy with the service we received, but the item just wasn't something we could use."
3,"Cute whale, but not a pillow-","This large-size beanie baby is darling, but it is NOT what I would call a ""pillow"" pal...if you order, don't expect to be anywhere near as large or pillow-y as a Pillow Pet."
2,Not really a pillow pal,This is just a run-of-the-mill stuffed toy...not really big enough to be a pillow pal. Too boring for DS to play with or smoosh into.
3,Stay with it,"Frequently fascinating but at the same time tedious and repetitive. There is no question this is a thorough in-depth history of the Troubles from the mid 60s to early 90s. Fascinating in history of terrorism in Ireland and its complete ruthlessness to gain political advantage. But also bogs down in places and becomes confusing in describing the numerous political factions and leaders involved which I guess is inevitable with the Troubles. Bell also tends to be overly dramatic by continually ending paragraphs in threes, e.g.,page 93 ""It was a right that must be exercised to be effective, a right to be seen, to be dominant"" or page 758 ""What did 1989 have to offer but horror, no political progress, the decay of hope in the agreement"" and countless other similar endings throughout. Overall, a fairly good read but you have to stay with it."
4,Shiney,"I'm happy to say that the book was still in very good condition when I ordered it; no writing in the margins, torn covers, or anything else. I'm perfectly happy with my purchase."
2,Barbie size hooks,"I got these for a dress up station I'm building for my daughter. I thought they were so pretty. I wanted to use them for her to hang dress up clothes and necklaces on. However, they are so small and could maybe fit in necklace per hook! They are still pretty but...not practical!"
5,This book was hysterical!,"I read this back when I was in junior high school & found it to be hysterical! My grandmother was visiting, taking care of us after my mom had surgery, she found it & told my mother that we were reading TRASH! (I guess to them back in the day, it was.) My mom & grandmother got it from our hiding place & threw it away! I'm going to throw it up in my mom's face about it now that I see used versions going for $25 freakin' dollars! LOL It was a great book & made you appreciate what you had, I've hated that the parental units threw it out to this day! :)"
5,being one's own grandpa,"Worth reading, if only for the explanation of how a person can be their own grandpa. As well, passage after passage reveals why traveling the longest distance between two points is worth doing."
2,seems like its not real sterling silver,"this ring is very pretty, fit and sizing was excellent, shipping speed was great, however, after a few weeks of wearing, the metal has a grainy texture and is turning dull. it appears that it is not real silver. i am also allergic to many other metals besides silver and i cannot wear the ring because my finger breaks out in hives. maybe the silver coat is wearing off? i am disappointed in the product and wish i would have invested in a more quality ring."
3,NonStick Coating Chipped Off,"I used this pan for the third time today. Before using it today, I noticed that there was a little chip (abou 1/4 inch)in the nonstick coating along the rim. After using it today, even more of the coating has chipped off. Now the coating is chipped off about 3/4 inch in two spots. I own probably 15 Nordicware pans and this has never happened. I purchased this item less than a year ago from Amazon but was unimpressed by their return policy. So I called Nordicware and was astonished by their prompt and satisfactory response. They promise to send me a replacement. I would give the product a one-star rating except after speaking to Nordicware customer service, I am hopeful that the replacement will be up to the standards of the other Nordicware products that I own."
2,TSTL,"tstl = too stupid to livethat is how I'd describe the characters in this book. The heroine had me cringing with her idiotic rants and the hero pushes things because he just decides to. snap. he decided it, therefore it must be good.If you like the insta-marriage, waiting to get it on until married, and marriage before love... perhaps you'd like this book.For me? While Lucy Monroe has a way with words, I kept cringing and swearing at the idiotic antics of this couple."
3,good hero,"The thing I liked most about this book was the strong male lead, from the beginning he was honest & focused on her well being, when he messed up, after thinking about it, he always chose to do what was best for her, he was strong alpha male that treated her like gold and was so sweet to her that you can't help but like him."
2,Not a good read,"Come Up and See Me Sometime was not a good book. The story chugged along with a minimum of plot. The timetable of the story is very fast and the hero is not a modern one. His beliefs struck me as sexist and the heroine for all of her touted business success, was anything but. The premise was a good one, but not enough substance to make it a great read."
5,WoW,"i LOVED THIS BOOK. iSABEL AND aLEX ARE A GREAT MATCH. yES, HE'S AN ALPHA AND CAN BE HARDHEADED BUT ISABEL JUST GIVE IT RIGHT BACK TO HIM. sHE DOESN'T TAKE ANY OF HIS BULL AND STANDS RIGHT UP TO HIM. pROVING TO ALEX THAT SHE IS AS DIFFERNT FROM HER FATHER AS NIGHT AND DAY. AS THE BOOK MOVES ALONG ALEX BEGINS TO RELAIZE THAT IN ORDER TO LOVE SOMEONE, REALLY LOVE SOMEONE YOU HAVE TO TRUST THEM COPLETLY AND AT THE END HE REALIZES THAT HE NEEDS TO LET GO OF HIS BITERNESS IN ORDER TO BE FREE AND LIVE HAPPLY WITH ISABEL ONCE AND FOR ALL"
2,Not as good as the other reviews would have you believe,"I've previously enjoyed Lucy Monroe's writing, but I'd advise you to pass this one up. The heroine doesn't know her own mind and the hero is a bully. Also, some of the writing is over the top. I ended up skimming the last 1/3 because I just couldn't stand it anymore."
4,hmm,"All in all it was a good book and I enjoyed it. It was a light read and the hero was an ultimate alpha male. I just couldn't help but roll my eyes at how naive, sweet, and innocent the heroine was! So forgiving! I was numb with disbelief at how patient she was. How understanding! My tooth hurt at how sweet she was. She forgave all his transgressions right away! Ugh I wished she bashed him over the head. I enjoy a good fight between heros and heroines.All in all still a good read!"
4,Sexy contemporary romance,"This is the first book I have read by Ms. Monroe and I thought it was very enjoyable. I was a bit surprised that others here rated it so low. I suppose I can see how some people might find Alex too overbearing, but I love a good alpha hero and he's the perfect example of one. And Isabel is a sweet heroine that the reader can identify with. If you are a fan of hot love scenes and attraction at first sight, then I would say this is the book for you."
1,Please buy something else,"Prior to buying these CDs, my husband and I used the 2-CD set, ""Speaking French with Michel Thomas."" We learned a lot quickly from those CDs, but wanted to learn more. So, we purchased the Instant Immersion French set. This has to be one of the worst purchases I have ever made! It is very difficult to determine what the people on the CD are saying, and the tasks are unclear. There is no guide book to help you along.I'm going to purchase the full Michel Thomas set now, and highly recommend his method of teaching over this set of CDs."
5,Just a review,"This book is very interresting. I would recommend the Image series to people who love: action, fighting, romance & suspense. Afterimage is about Drago, a vampire enforcer who must make sure that the other vampires obey the rules set forth by the Directorate (The vampire council.) Drago finds out that someone is trying to destroy him & that someone is named Marya Jaks. However, Marya is just a pawn used by Drago's real foe. Will Drago, now teamed up w/ Marya; discover who the real enemy is before it is too late & will his new teammate (Marya) give him something that he has been longing for, a companion.Buy the book & find out. You WILL NOT be disappointed.Sincerely,JenJayLynn"
4,Dark Romance,"Marya Jaks is a danger to the Undead. And yet, Drago, the vampire enforcer, grants her life. Then someone, using his name, tries to reverse his order and Drago realizes that someone, besides Marya, wants him dead. He must find out who and why, and quickly, for both his and Marya's sakes.After Image is a fast paced, rather dark tale of intrigue and betrayal, with one surprise twist after another. Ms. Roycraft's vampires are a bit more human than the traditional stereotypes but no less dangerous. Drago is not your typical hero as he is brooding, powerful and totally ruthless. Definitely not the knight in shining armor type. I was immediately enamored with him. Marya is a smart, gutsy woman who has a lot to deal with. The very real threat to her life and her growing feelings towards a being she had been brought up to hate.I always enjoy a book I can get involved in. I was able to put this one down occasionnally, but just barely."
4,Wireless headphones,"I think they are great,now I can hear what is being said on TV. Only complaint, on off and volume buttons should be on top because they change setting when touching back of sofa. I liked them so much I bought a pair for my sister."
1,what can I say?,What is there to say about a book that I put on a very high shelf about a quarter of the way through?Confusing and unfunny.
3,"rude humor, not as good as other Robert Ludlum books","some parts are funny, but it just didn't hold my interest like his newer books do. I couldn't put the Scorpio Illusion down. This one I struggled through. It just didn't move along like his other intense novels do. and there was quite a bit of off-color humor I couldn't appreciate."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,I may be the one guy out there that does not like his books. What makes me mad is that I have gone through about three of them because he gets so much good press. I find the writing wooden and he just does not hold my attention. Maybe I just have a mental block with him and the movies will be better.
5,Prepare yourself well,"Yes, this book is hilarious too. Ludlum does it again! Sam is still completely incompetent at anything but law and the Hawk is still ridiculously a genius. You can't help but feel for Sam, and the added characters of Aaron Pinkus and Sam's mom are just wonderfully done! This is one that can't be missed! Read it."
2,Not exactly good,"Road to Omaha could have been a really funny and enjoyable book if the author had just gone a little softer with off the wall ""coincidences"" and having 98% of the conversations being disjointed screaming matches. As it is I bought 10 books for $1.00 at a yard sale and this books wasn't even worth the .10 cents it cost me."
1,Poorly written attempt from a fine author,"Usually a terrific author, Ludlum makes it clear that he should leave comedy to those that write comedy. The attempts at humor are so stretched that they loose any chance of being funny. Finishing the book was challenging. Ludlum should be embarrassed by his effort."
1,This Book is Awful!!!,I'm mad at myself for having bought this book. I'm even madder at myself for having read it all the way through. I just thought it had to get better. It didn't.
4,absolute must,Sam and Mac are introduced in Gandolfo. Sam is still the same inept character but incredible lawyer. Mac finally explodes larger than life in Omaha. I picture Mac the same as Col. Kilgore from Apocalypse Now with the smell of napalm in the morning speech. The two Dezi's are a perfect compliment to Mac. This is not for the spy thriller crowd. This book is for those who love the crazy antics of a larger than life hero
2,Definately not the expected Ludlum,"I also could not finish this book, and I was captive on a coast to coast flight. The comedy in this book is strained and it is obvious that Ludlum was trying way too hard to be funny. I had to read and re-read passages just to make sense of what was written. The Road to Omaha is very bumpy indeed."
1,Not Great for Ludlum,"I'm sorry I bought it. Even though I read about it first, it was quite different from what I expected. In comparison to other Ludlum books,this one is just awful. Didn't even finish it."
1,It's a shocker,"I have never read such drivel. How on earth anyone would read and recommend this book, or even finish it, is beyond me. It's typical of an author cashing in on previous books. It must have taken 2 weeks to write and 20 bottles of Tequilla"
5,Excellent overview,This is an excellent overview of the subject of business etiquette in the new millennium. Chock full of advice and tips. Look forward to more from these authors.
2,numbing spray,Tried this greatly anticipating a wonderful product. Was greatly disappointed especially with the price of the product for such a small container and then did not feel like it made much difference when it came time for waxing. Disapointed.
5,takes the Edge off,Won't numb completely but definitely takes the Edge off. It really helps with the bikini area. If your looking for something pain free then stick to shaving. :) will keep using!
2,Doesn't work to well,"Bought this to use with a home laser hair removal system. It doesn't really numb the skin very well. So I have to use the laser system on the lowest setting, resulting in more sessions."
2,Did Not Work,"This stuff didn't work at all, I haven't even bothered finishing it. I just use my epilator without anything now. I'd rather use nothing than use something that doesn't work. It feels a little greasy too, which don't like."
1,Waste of money,This product did not wrk at all. I had to spray nearly half the bottle but my skin even started to get numb. Definite waste of money.
1,"seriously terrible, made waxing WORSE!","I picked this up at Sally's and used it liberally for my brazilian wax. I've had them twice before and they're excruciatingly painful for me. The third time I used this spray 15 minutes before and it was twice as bad as the first two times!! I actually CRIED. No kidding.This stuff not only is completely useless, it actually made it worse."
3,It works a good 75%...but the SMELL ughh,This is a good product it takes away some of the pain from my Brazilian but it smells really bad. Sometimes I just don't use it I'm going to try the no scream cream.
1,I'll take the razor bumps...,I would rather have razor bumps from shaving than use this product. Does not give any pain relief or numbing sensations to areas used. Instead of numbing and relief I was left with pain and irritated skin. Spend the extra bucks and go with 'No Scream Cream'. You'll be much happier.
1,NEED SOMETHING TO NUMB WAXING PAIN? NOT THIS SPRAY!!,"This spray does not work! I go in to get Brazilian Waxes... OUCH! The pain is worth the results, but anything to ease it would help! I bought ""no scream cream"" from [...] and it actually DOES minimize the pain. It costs a little more than this little spray, however it has more than 1.5 ounces and it does help a loT!!!!!!"
1,Terrible...,"I too was preparing for a wax and it did absoutely nothing and I even waited about 3 minutes just to make sure it set it...still nothing. There is a stinging pain after you spray it on, it was very uncomfortable. Save yourself $8."
1,it doesn't numb!,"i was preparing for a brazillian wax. i sprayed it on, let it sit (like it said to do) then i waxed. it was super painful. it didn't even dull the pain! i tested it on my hand, it didn't numb either! this product isn't worth the $8 i paid for it, plus it was way smaller than i thought it was going to be. the end"
5,"it works very well, but you will still not be 100% numb","this is not the same degree of numbing that you would get with a local injection, but as far as a topical spray goes, it is very good. i use it for tattooing and it takes the edge off and does not interfere with the ink/color. i have tried many different things but this one is the most effective (i don't really know why but it seems to absorb into the skin while others do not)."
1,useless,"completely useless, waste of time and money, doesnt work at all. i have never given out a review before but i didnt want others to be disappointed like me, reviews help alot, so take my advice and dont go for this."
2,numbing spray,"I bought this before i went to get a bikini wax i sprayed it on about 5 minutes before the waxing began and let me tell you i didn't think it really worked. i guess i was hoping it would lesson the pain considerably but it didn't, just very and i mean very slightly."
2,Ouchy! It made it worse!,"I bought this spray to use with my epilator on my bikini line. This spray smells really, really bad and it stings the skin. I applied it by spraying onto a cotton swab first so I could avoid certain delicate areas, but no matter how careful I was it still dripped all over the place. It didn't seem to numb the areas I targeted for hair removal, but all of the delicate areas it dripped on were numb for almost 24 hours. AND the unappealing smell lingered long after I had showered. Oh, and I used the whole entire bottle in one go. The hair removal was just as painful and the overall experience was terrible. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
3,Don't expect too much,"First of all, let me say this is great for temporary relief of cold sores. (Note: this isn't the ""correct"" usage, I am not a doctor) That being said, I didn't find that it relieved much of my pain from waxing. It is topical (as the product states) and it doesn't sink much farther than superficial into your skin. It's great for facial waxing on fuzz, but not really anywhere else on your body that has deeply rooted hair."
1,Doesn't numb,"It doesn't work - yes your skin feels a little numb when you're not doing anything, but it still feels exactly the same when you pull the hair out. Yikes!"
2,Meh,It doesn't really work other that to trick my brain into thinking it's working and doesn't hurt as bad. Not really worth it.
1,Doesn't work at all,I bought this to help with the discomfort of waxing my legs. Absolutely no difference in feeling. It smells bad and leaves a slightly oily residue.
1,Save your money,"Waste of money doesn't work, i tried using this product several different times & it just doesn't work at all. I wouldn't recommend wasting 8$ on it"
2,Advice from a waxing addict,"I wax everything! I have used this on my bikini line and it does take a little bit of the sting out of the waxing process, but not enough to warrant buying the product. For a first timer getting waxed, I would go ahead and buy this to use in addition to either taking tylenol or motrin one hour before you go to the salon. For first timers, it is good to have all the help you can get for the ""pain"" part of waxing. It is not that bad though!"
1,GET A NUMBING CREAM FROM YOUR GYNO!!!!,I used to try any over the counter numbing treatment for my brazilian waxes! I finally asked my gyno and she gave me a numbing cream called Emla... IT WORKS!!!
5,It Works,This product is excellent for what I need it for. I recently had a spinal operation. I have much pain all over my back. I found this product for numbing the area. It works for me and it helps me through out the day. I wish it came in a bigger size.
1,DOES NOT WORK,"The spray did NOTHING!!! I put it on before and after I waxed and I still turned red; my eyes still got teary and I still screamed with every pull of the strip. Ice works better, buying this is a complete waste of money. Those who may agree that it works are probably using their mind to numb the pain. I was beyond disappointed with this product. If this is the best they got for numbing then waxing will always be a PaInFuLlY rewarding experience."
1,This product did not work for me.,"I rated this one star because I didn't have a choice of negative three stars. The only reason I'm writing a review is to warn others. I followed the instructions, and I wasn't even numb a little bit. I'm disappointed."
1,Still very painful,I used this to wax cheast and back before trip did not make skin numb at all. I would look for something else the pain was still awful!!
4,Great Anthology,"I always liked John McLaughlin, but only sort-of. This album is a great overview of his career, and some of the other musicians and the interplay gives the album variety. Good for ""sort-of"" fans. The hard-cores will already own most of this. My favorites are Doxy and the extended Miles & John jam."
4,Fresh and Original.,"On, A HANGOVER YOU DON'T DESERVE, Bowling For Soup has a style reminscent of 80s pop bands they seem to be parodying. The cd has a lot of twisted, bizarre, and quirky songs. I purchased this album solely because of the song ""1985"". It's such a catchy little ditty. But, many of the song on the album also are. In fact, besides ""1985"" its hard to decide which songs deserve special mention. I guess I particularly liked:""Almost""""Trucker Hat""""Ohio (Come Back to Texas)""""Ridiculous""""Last Call Casualty""""Smoothie King""Bowling For Soup's songs aren't going to be enjoyed by everyone. However, on this ablum they provided me a little bit of 80s nostaligia which has introduced me to their clever and original style that is so fresh in today's popular music scene."
1,A Record Contract We Don't Deserve,That's the name they wanted to give this album but their record company advised against it. At least they were being honest. Too bad their music isn't.
2,shallow lyrics,"yeah they're posers, yeah, the songs are funny ""its really hard for ME to laugh at them"", yeah its ""fun"" music for people who don't want to actully listen to their music, the real problem is a lack of depth yeah a joke song is cool now and then but don't predicate yourselves on music you don't feel attached to. I mean i can wirte a deeper song about how my pencil broke today"
1,This sucks,"I can't believe everyone but 1 person reviewing this liked it, it sucks, simple as that. the songs aren't catchy, they're annoying as hell, mostly cause the singer's balls haven't droped yet so he sounds like Muffy from the show Arthur. what a wanker! oh, and it's not punk, or ""punk-pop"" as you like to call it, it's pop. them along with simple plan they are the new backstreet boys. listen to some real music, like Benny Goodman or Glenn Miller, or, um, the Dead Kennedys."
1,what the hell?,this is the worst cd i have ever heard. 1985? is this band serious? it's not even original!... and for the other songs... they just suck
1,i nearly got drunk and bought this album,i said nEARLY because i've never liked this pop band called bowling for soup too mainstream for me and the question are they really that stupid that they hasve to rely on humour to get anywhere in the music come on..there's loads of bands out there who write polictal and meaningful lyrics then music lovers go no we don't want meaningful lyrics we want fun and happy..well if you want fun and happy listen to bowling for soup blink 182 offspring and all these other pop bands that are crawling out of the woodwork with their laughable lyricshere's some real rock/metal/folk/bluesmark lanegan [bubblegum the winding sheet]leadbelly[blues genius]black sabbath[heavy metal]cream[blues hero's]jimi hendrix-guitarist best]eliott smith[singer/songwriter genius]nick drake[singer/songwriter genius]rage against the machine [polictal metal hero'sDO YOU GET IT YOU BUNCH OF POP WANNABESNO MORE
1,r u kidding??,these guys are terrible. 1985 is the worst song since that stupid new found glory song. its not even original and what is the lead singer like 50 now?
1,i once respected bowling for soup....,"but now that i've heard 1985, i think they're the biggest losers who ever hit the face of the earth. i mean...come on! YOU CANT JUST RIP OFF ""1985"" FROM ANOTHER BAND AND GET POPULAR FOR IT! wanna see what i'm talking about? check out the band ""SR-71."" they've been out for a while, they just released their 3rd album in japan in may of 2004. and if you can, listen to their song ""1985."" that's right, i said it, ""1985."" the same title from bowling for soup's album. same everything! except some lyricall changes. this is a joke."
4,Running Outta Gas...,"Lets face it, theres only so many ""Catchy Tunes"" a band can produce before it all starts to sound the same. Bowling For Soup has maybe one or two good albums left in them before they totally fall apart. That being said, ""A Hangover You Don't Deserve"" is still a fine album. Songs like ""Almost"", ""1985"", ""Ohio"" and ""Smoothie King"" stand out far beyond any other. Heres a run down of all the songs...1. Almost...9/102. Trucker Hat...8/103. 1985...10/104. Get Happy...7/105. Ohio...9/106. Ridiculous...7/107. Shut-up and Smile...5/108. Last Call Casualty...8/109. Next Ex-Girlfriend...7/1010. A-Hole...8/1011. My Hometown...7/1012. Smoothie King...10/10 (Best On Album)13. Sad Sad Situation...7/1014. Really Might Be Gone...7/1015. Down For The Count...5/1016. Two-Seater...8/1017. Friends O' Mine...6/10Overall: 3 1/2 Stars"
3,SR-71 is Better!,"I'm not really a big fan of BFS but they are ok. However, If you like 1985 then you owe it to yourself to check out SR-71 because they actually wrote that song. It's true, look inside the cd cover. And while your checking out bands go ahead and check out Marvelous 3 as the lead singer is the one who wrote ""Girl all the bad guys want"" and ""Live after Lisa"". Basically, all the good songs this band puts out are wrote by somebody else...but they are good to see live."
3,Was looking forward to this....,"cd for some time. Glad to see these guys have a ""hit"" on their hands in ""1985"", but overall, this band has frustrated me again. The first half of their previous cd, ""Drunk Enough To Dance"" is absolutely great. In fact, ""Surf Colorado"" is one of the greatest pop-punk tunes I've heard. But right after that tune is done, I need to turn off the cd because every single tune sounds exactly like the one preceding it. Bummer! Anyway, I was hoping for something a little new from BFS this time out and I've only listened to it once and it sounds like same old, same old."
4,"For everyone who says ""1985"" was ripped off SR-71","Taken from SR-71's official fansite.(Sep 23, 2004) If you haven't heard about the song 1985 yet, here's the info. Mitch and the band wrote the song and recorded it on their latest CD, Here We Go Again. Bowling for Soup heard the song and asked if they could record the song for their CD. Mitch basically gave them the song and let them record and release it. The Bowling for Soup version is doing pretty good and there's even a video available at the Bowling for Soup website. It's a pretty funny video and even has Mitch in it as a cameo. Check it out if you haven't already.So please do me the favor of checking your plagiarist mentality at the door. Apparently, the word ""cover"" has never come to mind."
5,A Strike,"Witty, funny, with a Sense of humor BFS does it with driving rhythm guitar and big sound.'A Hangover You Don't Deserve' is a great example of how to perfectly blend humor and music.They are one of the best at it.....Listen to the lyrics and the melodies from this CD and it will be one of your favorites. LOL"
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this cd for Almost and 1985. It was worth it for those. The other songs aren't all bad, but they aren't all great either. I will listen to it while working on stuff, but if I want something to sing along to, I don't think the songs other than Almost and 1985 will work for me.That's just my personal preference, though, and I'm sure there are many people who will enjoy the entire cd, or at least most of it."
3,Disappointing,"I heard the song ""1985"" on the radio a few times and fell in love with it! I always like hearing new music so I thought what the heck I'll go ahead and by the cd. Of course the song ""1985"" is the best one on the whole album. All the rest of the songs sounded pretty much the same and the lead singer seems to always be singing in the same key! I was pretty bored with it not even half way through. However, the lyrics are very clever and well put together! Great rhymes in many of the songs. Not much diversity though on this cd and I found it overall to be very disappointing."
4,Tons of fun!,"Bowling For Soup has vaulted to the top of the Punk/Pop genre with this album. Filled with songs about getting dumped and messing up relationships, I've seldom had this much fun hearing such sad luck stories. The lyrics, though, can be just plain hilarious at times. The tunes are bright, poppy numbers that require you to sing along. Butch Walker is again at the helm here, and its mixed by the great Tom Lord-Alge."
5,Very Well Done BFS,"First and foremost Amazon should prevent retarded kids putting their ""I hate this and this, waaahhhh"" stuff. That is just blatantly annoying. Secondly, if you like the pop-punk genre, but like a lil more structure or some better lyrics then usual, take a listen to this album. While it is nothing above and beyond, its pop-punk done to it's very best. Every song is catchy, lyrically fun or easy to relate to, and the whole album is just something you could listen to over and over. Nothing extraodinary maybe, but if you want something fun and still done musically perfectly and with tight unision in the music listen to this."
5,Brilliant,"Bowling for Soup has always been one of my favourite bands, and I think they really outdid theirselves with this new album. Every song is unique and catchy, and you'll be able to listen to it for hours on end without getting bored. Perhaps the actual music isn't the most technically challenging, but the songs are really well written and performed. Even if you're not a fan, go ahead and buy this album - you'll cherish every song, from the explicit but funny ""My Hometown"", to the less noisy ballad ""Ridiculous"".One of the best buys of the year."
3,Great follow up but not as catchy,"ok first of all that kid talking about 1985 being a ripoff, is very wrong, they didnt just rip the song off, sr-71 and bowling for soup are actually good friends and sr 71 told bowling for soup to record the song and use it for their single cus sr 71 didnt plan on using it as a single and thought the song deserved to be a single. this is evidenced by the fact that the singer from sr 71 makes a cameo in the video for 1985. anyways the album is good and has alot of fun songs, although I dont think they needed to pack 18 songs on it, I'm glad they did I like when bands put all the songs they write on the record instead of just picking 10 or so and makin us pay 20 bucks. this cd is a good follow up and i'm sure it will be well received as long as you dont mistake them for ""ripoffs"" but at the end of the day the songs arent as memorable and catchy as the classics like emilee, punk rock 101, and girl all the bad guys want."
3,overplayed,"I gotta give them props, they are pretty good at making catchy tunes, and so forth. the first time i heard ""1985"" i thought it was okay. the secondtime i heard it, i instantly fell in love with it. but it got so overplayed i couldn't bear hearing the ooh hoo hoo. but then ""almost"" came and i fell in love with that. then, i got it as a Christmas present. The first couple of songs are pretty good until it gradually starts to become worse and sound exactly the same. overall, if u like any of the singles they released, whether you're a fan or a starter you still should get the album despite the cons."
2,"""Eggs Sizzling in a Skillet""","An extremely slow subtitled film, with time-consuming scenes of people staring, a man masturbating, neighbors crying, a man driving and eggs sizzling in a skillet. Minimal dialogue adds to the tediousness. The context of the traumatic Chilean political upheaval and counterrevolution of 1973 is pretty interesting, as are the scenes pertaining to the ethics of mortuary science in wartime. Unfortunately, these get limited play in the overall narrative scheme. Unless you are particularly interested in movies that are more ""art"" than ""drama"", you probably won't care for this one."
4,An upgrade from PCC.,"Although they have a reoccuring track ""Cupid's Chokehold"" the rest of the CD is playful and fun. Clothes off is a good track to listen to and dance. Not bad. Get it you won't be disappointed."
5,Gym Class Heroes...listen to the future of hip-hop,"A truly amazing CD, when I first discovered this band after hearing just one track, I rushed out to buy the album the very same day. They really are that good, and they have their own unique style, I can't think of any other bands that are remotely like them. The style of some songs may sound similar to other bands, but the voice of Travis McCoy (Schleprok) really sets this band apart from the rest. Their melodic tones and true and honest words puts the Gym Class Heroes into an individual genre all their own. I have been streaming some of thier new tunes online for a while and pre-ordered the album. I would have to give this album 10 out of 10, you really should give them a listen and find out. While your at it, have a listen to The Papercut Chronicles as well. It is the first album that was released by Fueled by Ramen/Decaydance. You will NOT be disappointed AT ALL !!!!!"
5,Better than before,"Most groups have a sophmore slump when they come out with their 'big' second cd. This is not the case with Gym Class Heroes. The riffs and melodies are far smoother than on ""The Paper Cut Chronicles"". One difference is that lead singer Travis McCoy does not rap over the music as much as he did on ""chronicles"", but rather ""sings"". Highly recommended songs-scandalous scholastics, on my own time (write on), shoot down the stars, and of course the already popular new friend request and the queen and I."
2,$13 not well spent,"this is my first Gym Class Heroes album and I'm dissapointed. I heard good things, but I was still wary for awhile until I finally convinced myself to give it a try. The album sounds very mainstream and should never ever be considered hip-hop. The music is good, if by itself. I'll admit, I was into the album for about a week, but then the songs just started to sound repetitive and boring. Travis has some good lyrics, but nothing that makes you think he's something special. If you're looking for hip-hop, run in the other direction. If you're into mainstream music, you may like it."
2,Why?,"Alright, their first two full-lengths ""For The Kids"" and ""The Papercut Chronicles"" were amazingly original. The live instruments backing Travis' lyrics broke up the monotony of today's hip hop.Now with this latest release has kept me wishing they had never signed with Fall Out Boy's label.They have replaced the primarily instrument driven music with samples. Travis lyrics still are very good, but nothing special in the world of conscious hip hop.So, the more I listen to As Cruel As... the more upset I get that they threw away something incredibly special for a more mainstream-pop sound.Maybe they will pull it together for a follow-up.COME BACK OLD GYM CLASS HEROES."
2,"CD is ok, Amazon's track list is WRONG","I haven't listened to the entire CD yet, but it's only OK from what I have heard. Of course I bought this CD wanting to get not only ""The Queen and I"" but also ""Cupid's Chokehold.""Just a quick note, if your are looking for ""CUPID'S CHOKEHOLD,"" DO NOT buy this CD. That song is not on here. I know the track list says it is, but it's not. I have contacted Amazon about the wrong track listing; it remains to be seen if they'll do anything about it.This is the actual track list:1. 1st Period: The Queen and I2. 2nd Period: Shoot Down the Stars3. 3rd Period: New Friend Request4. 4th Period: Clothes Off!5. Lunch: Sloppy Love Jingle, Pt. 16. 6th Period: Viva La White Girl7. 7th Period: 7 Weeks8. 8th Period: It's OK, But Just This Once!9. Study Hall: Sloppy Love Jingle, Pt. 210. 10th Period: Biters Block11. Yearbook Club: Boys in Bands Interlude12. 12th Period: Scandalous Scholastics13. 13th Period: On My Own Time (Write On!)14. Detention: Sloppy Love Jingle, Pt. 3"
3,Loved this song from Supertramp,"Cupid's Chokehold was a great song when it was called ""Breakfast in America"" by Supertramp. That was a great band. Whatever happened to them?"
4,Great story.,"This is a lovely little story about a boy who wants to take home to his apartment every animal he meets. He finds what he thinks are fish eggs and finally convinces his mother to let him keep them. When he returns home from summer vacation, what does he find he has? 103 frogs instead!It's accessible and interesting pictures tell most of the story. A lovely book, and a shame it is out of print."
4,pretty good,"no words just jeff's music.still good though.the music alone is great but c'mon the song's nothing without jeff's voice.the cd would seem like a classical type cd but i could listen to it anytime, like a backround music."
1,Wish I could rate this DISGRACE with zero stars.,I agree with mzannetou and Michael Davison. This is an absolute disgrace to Jeff's memory.
3,A good account of the times...,"However, his writing style was a bit too loaded with un-needed color. It was a bit too ""dime novel"" for me. I appreciated ""We Pointed Them North"" far more for its true to actual life account of the times than I did this here author. Nonetheless, it is an account of the times that is still interesting to read."
2,Enough already,"Enough of the Harajuku Girls, enough of the ripped off riffs, enough of the failed attempt to reinvent herself by regurgitating stuff we heard 20 years ago... Does no one care that this album was overhyped, over developed, over engineered and over all disappointing!? I don't see it, don't get it and don't understand what the hype is about. You'd be better off getting some of the original New Wave music from the '80s than hearing this tired attempt to hide it under the thin veil that is Stefani's voice."
4,Just one Flaw,"I'VE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR THIS AWSOME ALBUM FOR A LONG TIME NOW1.WHAT YOU WAITING FOR?10/10 AWSOME DANCE SONG2.RICH GRIL 10/10 ANOTHER EVE/GWEN/DRE MASTERPIECE3.HOLLABACK GIRL 9/10 FUN CHEERLEADING TYPE SONG4.COOL 8/10 GREAT SONG BUT TO SLOW FOR THIS ALBUM5.BUBBLE POP ELECTRIC 8/10 FUN SOMETIMES CHEESY BUT FUN6.LUXURIOUS 5/10 TOO R&B; FOR THIS ALBUM7.HARAJUKU GIRLS 9/10 WEIRD BUT OK8.CRASH 10/10 REALLY FUN9.THE REAL THING 9/10 GOOD SONG BUT KINDA SLOW10.SERIOUS 10/10 NICE WELL DONE SONG11.DANGER ZONE 10/10 HOT TRACK12.LONG WAY TO GO -100/10 THIS SONG IS AWFUL ""WHAT WAS SHE THINKING"" MOSTLY EVERYONE HATES THIS SONG TOO. DOESENT REALLY GO WITH THE REST OF THE ALBUM, IT WOULD OF FIT MUCH BETTER IN AN OUTCAST ALBUM. WELL THATS JUST MY OPINION ."
5,Hollaback Girrrll!!!!!,"This is the best album from a female i have heard in 10 years. It is catchy, unpredictable, and smoldering. I am a product of the 80's, so much of the sound is from that era. The song writing is strong as is her vocals. My favorite song is Danger Zone. its how madonna used to be.britney may have the crown, but Gwen Stefani has the throne."
1,What was Gwen thinking? Really?!,"I am one of Gwen's & No Doubts biggest fans. This does not sound like a dance album which she keeps claming it is. Why is she jocking harajuku girls through the whole cd? I don't get it. Mentioning it in one song is enough isn't it? I agree with deeper 83's review. This was a huge disappointment. All those collaborations were horrible. Andre 3000, come on! Why did she use the rhythm to a Notorious BIG song for luxurious? Borrow a friends's cd don't buy it. The photos are great of her but the artwork looks like a 5 year old in Tokyo did it. Sorry Gwen love ya but not this album."
3,THIS ISN'T WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR...,"Big Deception i had when i heard this album...Gwen is now a kind of diva pop, but her first solo cd is just not good enough.""What you waiting for"" ""Rich Girl"" ""Bubble pop Electric"" and maybe ""Harajuku Girls"" are goods tracks, but the rest sounds very repetitive and at the end this could be more boring than been waiting for hours to someone. Buy it under your own risk."
1,L.A.M.E.,"Wow this album is a complete train wreck. If you are buying this album expecting to hear No Doubt , you will be scornfully disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I`m a No Doubt fan just like you, although it did take me awhile to warm up to RockSteady. Almost every song on this album straight out sucks, expect for the now overplayed single, which now frankly I'm sick of. I gave this album about two listens and now I'm through with it, completely unsalvageable. I know this review is a bit more scathing than it should be, but I feel that the wool (LAMB, wool, get it) has been pulled over my ears. If I have to say something positive I will say that the CD holder and special packaging is cool; this album is kind of like a sandwich with premium bread and rancid meat. Be wary or any overzealous review, they are probably on Interscope's payroll."
1,......How horrific,"....I can't believe that fumbling, bumbling, crumbling, piece of steaming cat crap single Hollaback Girl made no. 1. That is just....obscene. That is shameful. That is disgraceful. And I thought the UK had low musical standards, Good God. We live in an age where trashy, horrible, HORRIBLE hip hop crap like Candy Shop and this garbage make number one. Somewhere, a group of real artists are sobbing."
5,Not a No Doubt Album!,"For those No Doubt fans looking for a new No Doubt album, this is not it. I've always been a fan of No Doubt, and have been waiting for Gwen's solo release. This is an 80's dance album, with a modern day flair included. It's great to hear Gwen's distinct voice with a different music style. But if you buy this album and expect to hear No Doubt's music style, you may be left scratching your head. I love this album....top score from me!"
4,Nice volumn for ESV 2012 update,"...needed to have a concordance for the 2012 ESV revision, since I'm partial to this translation - the ESV having room for several improvements yet but much more accurate than the NIV and much less wooden than the NASV (in fact, in numerous instances, more literal/accurate than the NASV). It is a bare bones concordance, which was obvious when ordering it. Nevertheless, one will need other tools such as a lexicon, etc. The quality of the book itself seems very good. The type is very small and compact and you'll have to sort of pry it out of the gutter for the inside columns; Crossway could've published it in a larger size. However, it's a necessary accoutrement for study. So, there you are, it is what it is."
5,Well Done Comprehensive ESV Concordance,"As I'm now starting to use ESV translation more and more, needed a comprehensive concordance and this does the job nicely. Not too oversized a format and print yet one can read.Don't understand the criticisms given it not being an exhaustive, as usually as in my case, those of us who work in the original languages have concordances in Hebrew and Greek.Nice price and Biblical tool."
2,shortsighted,"this Esv concordance is useless, in long run, without greek/hebrew references, which is only reason i use one..otherwise dictionaries serve better..perhaps it was rush job..but in order for ESV to be The Bible, which would be good, follow up with helps has to be exhaustive..esp. if one wants to build commentary etc..I'm thankful for work done but believe the above.."
3,it far out there and not all true,have read the book before and after it was printed and be writing about in the book i for one feel that my father writing is seltive and not after the truth but after selling more book. He is and always will be out there. He doses not write about the life he gave me or how he would screw up everything i got involes with by his talk. I have told him to re right the book and tell the truth and to find out what the truth is how he squarder the money and thing my grandparent gave him and how it not all true and he need to to write about the truth
1,Save your money - these are useless!,"Don't rely on these to pass the bar! They don't give you nearly enough information to prepare you for the multistate, and some of the information they do give is wrong!"
1,"Rating is not for item, but for Amazon","This might have been a good product, but because of either the fault of the post office, or the fault of Amazon,I never received it. I was given such a run-around between Amazon and my local post office that eventually the item was sent back apparently because of an ""insufficient address"" even though the first message I received about its attempted delivery noted that delivery was attempted but nobody was around for signature (even though I had it sent to my government work address, where someone is ALWAYS available to sign). After a lot of back-and-forth and waiting, the item was ultimately sent back and when I called Amazon to ask if they could ship it back to me, expedited, they said they could not -- I would have to wait until the item was processed in their returns departments and then put back on stock, and then somebody would call me to tell me it was back in inventory so I could reorder. I never received such a call. I am extremely fed up with Amazon."
1,wrong law!,"I'd give this even less than one star if i could -- just a cursory glance at some of the subject in my first few weeks of bar review, and I could see the mistakes in the cards -- the law is wrong on a lot of the flashcards. dont rely on these cards for bar prep!"
2,"Burning and Texturing... PICTURES, not METHODS","The reader of this book will learn at least one thing from it; the author is a very good carver! It's pages are full of fine (but black & white) pictures of various aspects and stages of carving a decorative decoy.Unfortunately that's basically it -- pictures. There is little commentary to go with them. A detailed, step-by-step explanation of how to achieve what one sees in the pictures would've made this book very valuable, but no such explanations are there.To sum it up, if you think you can figure out how to woodburn a carving by looking at pictures, this book may be for you."
1,The poorest craft methods book I've read,"Although the author claims this book is for beginners, only an expert could benefit from it. The author simply had someone photograph while he carved and burned a single duck, then labeled the pictures. No background, explanation, or discussions were given. A more desciptive title, emphasizing an expert interested only in ducks, would be very helpful to the reader."
2,Good referance photos,This book is a good referance for the craftsman who already knows how to use a woodburner and is looking for photos of how the feather groups are burned. This book is heavy on photos and light on instruction.
2,Lots of pictures.,"Not enough explicit info about burning and testuring, just a lot of pictures out of any productive sequence, not much about technique or specific equipment."
5,Veasey - Detailing techniques,Another Veasey classic. He shows the techniques for the higher elements of fine decoy carving...it's a treasure. Bill is a master carver but more importantly a masterful artist who after all these years is still at the top.
2,My least favorite J.D. book (so far?),"I've read all but 5 of Jude Deveraux's books. This was, by far, my least favorite. It was a complete waste of time.The first half is all about how Emily can't believe Michael is an angel. We get it - you don't buy it - move on! The entire story is absurdly superficial; I can summarize the plot in 2 sentences. No real romance. And somehow, in the end, Emily ends up with a perfect life and no recollection of how she really got there. Too bad my memory can't be erased of this awful experience, too."
5,i really like this book,"i don't know why everyone is saying this book is not good, but i sure did enjoy this. I mean Micheal is just the type of angel i wouldn't mind have right? He's love for Emily was so great he rather live a happy life then being an angel. If i had an angel like Micheal, i wouldn't mind... I recommand this this book who believes in a hansome,sexy, and great sense of humor angel."
1,Fairly-packaged load of nothingness,"I was very disappointed by this new book by Deveraux. Like most other reviewers, I have read most of her books. I used to look forward to the Montgomery or Taggert sagas she so eloquently portrayed. But THIS? The heroine is too simple, too flat. The hero, too cute, too perfect. It seems to me there lacks a sense of characterization in the novel. So the plot IS predictible. But with some real characters, that wouldn't have been so bad. The whole ensemble, though, was a snore.Besides, can anyone really feel sexual towards an angel, especially one that stresses so often his non-human qualities? Or is it just me???"
2,Not up to her usual standard,"A disappointing silly plot, with characters of less interest than usual. Some of the lesser characters were interesting but the hero and heroine just didn't seem to gel."
3,It was different!,"This book held my interest from page 1 which is saying something. I hoped for a more believeable conclusion. It was an adventure in fantasy, had to keep saying to myself, this is just fiction. I will read more of her books just out of curiousity. Rated the book a six because it was intrigueing and did hold my interest, just a ""different"" story line."
3,"Another historical romance, please?","Wonderful book, if you are into angels and such. I had a very hard time readiing this book. The characters are not as memorable as her Montgomery's or Taggarts. Plot was missing something. Overall, it was okay. Not spectacular."
5,Another good book from my favourite author,"An Angel For Emily is one of the best books of Ms.Deveraux. The story is simple, entertaining and funny and makes me wish for a guardian angel of my own. Maybe Emily's passion for sex is not as hot as others might have expected but her feelings towards Michael is unmistakable. And I love the humor about Archangel Michael, Adrian and other assumptions of angelic behaviour that are in this book. Definitely my favourite author since I was 14. Can't wait for the next book!! PS: By the way, if anyone knows how I can contact Ms.Deveraux, please email me."
4,a wonderful lighthearted angelic romance,"I have read several of jude's books. This wasn't my favorite but for some light-hearted, uplifting, rainy day reading it was great."
3,Characters weren't that appealing,"Not one of Jude's best efforts. The story is light and can be humourous at times, yet the characters weren't covered in depth. They failed to appeal and didn't walk off the pages like some of Jude's other characters (eg Liana & Rogan fr ""The Taming) But I haven't lost faith in Jude yet, and I'm anxiously awaiting her next book...."
2,A disappointment,"I usually enjoy Jude Deveraux's books, but this one lacked something, or several somethings. Passion, for one-- Michael is an endearing character in some ways, but his love for Emily's pure soul is not the stuff of romantic fiction. Emily comes across as a bit of a twit, and the novel's climax is nothing short of ridiculous. Emily is jeaporadized by a poorly thought out and unintentionally hilarious ""evil"" so thinly plotted it is obviously nothing more than the barest excuse for having this angel come to earth. Skip it."
1,YAWN!,"This was a huge disappointment from my favorite author. I have read all of Jude Deveraux's books and I can say that this one read like the Dick and Jane books we grew up with. The characters were uninspiring and the chemistry was nil between the two. The only reason I finished it was because I actually paid money for the book rather than waiting for it at the library. Jude, take your time with your next book. Give us another Knight or Duchess."
5,A book you can't put down,"It's was the first Deveraux book I have read and I could not put it down - it was so interesting, romantic and funny. I finished it in 1 1/2 days - great book. If you don't believe in angels you will after you have read the book"
5,Fantastic Fantasy,"I've read the other reviews and each to their own, but I must say - if you catergorize this book where it should be - as an entertaining, fun, fantasy tale - it deserves no less than 5 stars!I found this to be very enjoyable - I love the idea of finally meeting your very own guardian angel and romantically speaking - why not have one who is such a gorgeous hunk of manhood?!? I could deal with that! The dialog was outrageously funny - trademark Deveraux flippancy! - I read this while on vacation and enjoyed it immensely - it is a keeper - Like all of Deveraux's books!"
1,Not worth 1 star,"Don't waste your time and money. The humor was not funny, the editing was poor, and the fantasy didn't work. I started skimming the book about halfway through and wanted to trash it."
1,Sorry Jude!!,I couldn't make it through the first 4 chapters and trust me I tried so hard. This is the only book from Jude Deveraux I had to put down and couldn't pick back up. Boring a real snoozing book. Jude I love you babe but can't help you on this book. All the others were wonderful. I started with the Velvet Series and just worked my way down the list the rest are a must read but skip this book.
1,Actually deserves zero stars,"This makes the second and the last book I've brought by Jude Deveraux. My main regret is that I purchased this piece of garbage for $7.00 from a store. I definitely will not be risking my money on any of her other novels. I could not believe that Michael could possibly love this shrew of a woman. She didn't seem to have one redeeming characteristic. Not only was she a witch, she was also a gullible fool. I would warn other readers to stay away from this one."
1,Not your Classic Jude Book,"""Knight in Shining Armor"" was a masterpiece; ""Wishes"" was a riot. This is so disappointing; even the title is trite. It was surprising that this new book was on the shelf at the library, usually Jude's books have waiting lists. But after reading it, I understand why. It has no pizazz at all."
1,What happened to my favorite author????,"I hate to admit it, but I have to say I was very disappointed with this one. Usually, when I see a new one from Ms. Deveraux, I don't even read the synopsis, I just purchase it right then and there. Lately her novels have been very tired. The characters lack depth and personality. Her sharp wit and sense of humor are gone. I long for her books like the Montgomery annals. Those were great reading. What happened? It seems that she's lost the interest in writing."
3,It was okay,"An Angel for Emily was a nice read. It wasn't an intense or passionate romance novel. It was more quite and sweet. The concept of a guardian angel falling in love with his charge was different. In addition, to the romance the book had a hint of a thriller; a creep mysterious house, bad guys, and an unsolved historical murder. I agree with one reviewer when she wrote that the book seemed hurrried espically at the end. It was wrappped up a little too neatly. Besides the poor ending and the editing mistakes; first Emily has brown eyes then five pages later they are blue! There was the problem with the subplot involving the villians. It just didn't make much sense. Their part of the story seemed an after thought. The connnection to Emily was never hinted at all throughout the novel. It was like reading a who done it and finding out at the end that it was a character added at the last ten pages. Overall it was an easy pass the time novel."
3,Not highly recommended but acceptable.,"While Ms. Deveraux has never failed to amuse me, this book has made my opinion of my idol's writing drop a little lower. Sad to say, the usual hard and fast way of writing was dropped altogether and I believe that several parts of this book is still missing like pieces from an unfinished jigsaw. Read it, but don't expect too much from it."
3,"Entertaining but lacked the Jude Deveraux ""magic.""","I found the story enjoyable to read but, not as entertaining as I had hoped. The story line was different and interesting to read. But, I was disappointed because it didn't seem to be written by Ms. Deveraux and her ""magic touch"" she seems to have. The entertaining and humorous dialouge wasn't there like in many of her other novels like the Velvet Saga and THE PRINCESS.I hope to see another novel of hers soon. Maybe it will be about the Taggert or the Montgomery families."
3,Well....,"Just to say, it certainly wasn't the best book Ms. Deveraux has written. It had good beginning though, but lacked all the humor and romance in her other books. I'm glad that I didn't buy the book but checked it out at the library instead. I suppose if one is looking for some different plots An Angel for Emily is the one. Did anyone else think that Emily was a bit....well, spineless?"
1,Not up to her usual standards.,"I always look forward to a new Jude Deveraux book on the shelf. This one was such a disappointment. Too cute. Too sugary. All cotton candy fluff and no substance. I will still be looking forward to the new Jude Deveraux book when it comes out but I'm hoping it is more in line with the quality, suspence, feeling, etc. that I expect from her."
5,Wonderful warm and uplifting,"Jude Deveraux has never failed me, her books are always full of heart, this one is no exception. If I ever had a doubt about angles I have none now. Micheal was one of her best, the way he loved her touched me to the very depths of my soul. I was left laughing and crying the whole book, and those fellings stayed with me for days after I had finished reading. It may not have been ""A Knight in Shining Armor"", or ""Sweet Liar"", but it is absolutly on my best sellers list."
1,The gong show goes angelic,"This was the first book that I have read by Jude Deveraux. I thought by the jacket it would be a cute, funny book. Well it tries to be funny and really doesn't make it. It tries to be romantic, but unless one has never heard of or doesn't believe in God, it doesn't stand as plausable. It tries to be a drama and comes up weak. Emily is a grown woman who has no idea what she wants or can get out of life. What seemed like a nice book in the beginning,finished with me still wanting to find some thread to believe in. I'm sure with all the books that Deveraux has written this must have been a ""bad page day""."
3,The Librarian and the Angel,"Emily is a librarian who gets stood up by her reporter fiancee, and in her distress, hits the angel, Michael.Michael has been her guardian angel for centuries and he is on a special assignment to see who is out to harm her.You may like this, though it may be disturbing, the part we're they have sex."
1,I could not finish this book it was so bad,"I really loved a ""Knight in Shining Armor"" and then went on to read as many Montgomery/Taggert books as I could find. I cannot believe that Ms. Deveraux actually wrote this book...it was so bad. The characters were unsympathetic. There was a distinct lack of wit and humor. I could not finish it although I really tried."
4,As always - Jude wins!,I've read over many of the reviews that others have given and was dissapointed with the over all outcome. Jude Deveraux is my absolute favorite authors and I always look forward to her new releases - Although An Angel for Emily was not the best she has done - It was definitly an uplifting and light story that made you smile when the book was over. Way to go Jude!
4,The Story is Great!,"I love this story. Such a fresh new idea. I haven't read a novel by Ms. Deveraux that I didn't love! Her books make you fall in love with the hero. I wish I had a guardian angle like Michael. Everyone who loves Romance, would enjoy this one."
1,Too silly for words,"It seems as though there are two Jude Deveraux's. There is one who writes really good books like ""Knight in Shining Armor"" and one who writes real nonsense like ""An Angel for Emily"". Let us hope that the one who writes well returns soon, for this book is just plain silly. It has no continuity. Sentences don't make sense and there is no follow through of ideas. I have enjoyed many of Deveraux's books-but this is not one of them."
5,X-Com Enemy Unkown Remake,"I've been playing X-Com Enemy Unknown (UFO Defense) since I was 12 years old. UFO: Extraterrestrials is absolutely, 100%, without a doubt in my mind, the remake we have all been waiting for. There are very few bugs, it was professional developed and deserves the ""funds"" of every true X-Com fan."
2,Over-rated,"As a x-com series fan I was disappointed at this release. Yes the graphics are better BUT a lot of the x-com physics are missing. For example throwing grenades now is hit and miss whereas with the original you could hit walls and have the grenade bounce back. Also missing are a good variety of aliens, UFOs and a poor variety of maps which seem lifeless anyway. You'll find yourself doing missions which look almost exactly the same each time and you'll get bored of it very easily. Another thing is you only really have one operation base the rest can only be used for interceptors and the whole base management thing is a dumbed down version of the original.There are user mods around which make it a lot better but still it's a mediocre game. I wouldn't play it without the mods! Quite frankly you're better off with UFO: Alien Invasion which is still under development but is free and more true to the original (and fun as well)."
2,to many annoyances to make it playable,The biggest turn-off of this game is not being able to recruit new units. If you only get 1-2 units injured per mission you will soon have no one left to do anything.
5,UFO 1993 returns with 2007 graphics,"since ufo 1993 became obsolete, by computers becoming more and more powerful, it finally happened!! they re-made the game that was so popular to millions!its the same basic game, with new graphics, and new aliens to fight."
5,So far so good....,"I've only had these for 1 season, but after many hours of use and bouncing around in the ocean, they work and sound great!!!"
4,I'm a fan!,"This mix is much more representative of his live sets than some of his studio mixes. What separates DJ Dan from the other house DJ's is that he doesn't play the obvious house tracks/labels that circulate the house charts. Instead, DJ Dan distinguishes his sound by throwing down high powered tracks with catchy hooks which are often produced by the lesser-knowns. Furthermore, he's got a great feel for keeping the energy level up without going over the deep end.I was at Ruby Skye when he recorded the session. The DVD's features, which include live footage and a slide show of photos taken from the event, captured the atmosphere of the event and brought back a lot of great memories for me. This is probably the best DJ Dan cd out there. Of course, no cd will ever match the excitement of his live shows. Nonetheless, if you've got a good soundsystem and home entertainment center, this CD/DVD package aint' bad either."
4,Great Dog Pack,My dog would walk with me 3 miles and not be tired in the least. After purchasing this pack and walking her for the same 3 miles; she now comes home and rests. It actually makes her work a little harder during the walk and tires her. She's a lot happier and I am as well.
1,Cra*. Don't bother unless you're bored.,"In the prelude/introduction, the author states herself that she made the system up. It's not authentic by any stretch of the word. True egyptian astrology was entirely different- go look it up instead.It's an amusing read, though, and you can tell the author did put effort into making it, but seriously... not worth buying. I got it as a gift."
5,"Warm, Insightful Book!!!","This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves dogs, especially people who understand the true beauty of older dogs. Asher's photographs are emotion provoking as they seem to capture the essence of the dogs' personalities. I bought this book as a present for someone and one for myself. I am going to buy at least 2 more as gifts. :)"
1,dry,"sorry, but this is a very boring book. you can try it but I sure wouldn't recommend it. Even the pictures weren't that engaging."
1,Don't waste your money,"I'm a dog lover, and an old dog lover, but this book has little substance to make it worth your time or money. It is nothing more than snapshot quality black and white photographs of about fifty older dogs with some 'cutesy' made-up ""Longevity Secret"" phrase on the page opposing each photograph. The thirty or so people that gave this book five stars must all be friends of the author. Look for it at the library,.. that's where I got rid of my copy."
2,Not so good,"Basically, I would not recommend this product. It is over-priced for what it does. There are problems with the Russian letters too. I am disappointed with this product."
5,Excellent service,"Thank you for the timely and excellent service you provided. The CD's were in great shape. I would order from you again anytime!Thanks,Linda"
1,defective DVD,I have always been happy with the many DVDs I have purchased from you and from other places. But this VDV has distorted images in it. I tried to find a telephone number for you but could not so did not know how to return the product. Am reluctant to order anything else. Gloria Henderson
5,Tom Clancy Fan,"I liked Tom Clancy's work. The Movies were even better. Baldwin did ok in Hunt for Red October. In my opinion Harrison Ford made a better Jack Ryan in the end even though the rumors of some not getting along with him on the set. Movies were done very realistic in a sense, except I didn't like the new one at all ""The Sum of all Fears"". Sorry."
5,Bangin Double Disc Album!,"Mr Criminal has great respect for the legend 2pac Shakur. This album is like All Eyes on Me. Both discs are great! If you like listening to real rappers and real music pick this cd up. As soon as you hear this album you'll say ""man! what other albums does he have?"" When you hear what he's about, his music becomes addictive. Mr Criminal is taking over the rap game for sure with his beats and lyrics. Most rappers run out of stuff to rap about so they flop out the game. Others see the money and quit. But Criminal keeps coming harder and harder with each album he makes. Trust me you wont be dissapointed. His vision that he has on life is very powerfull and deadly. Go on youtube.com if you don't belive me."
3,THIS LAND IS YOUR LAND,GOOD WORLD WAR 2 FILM ABOUT THE EVERYDAY PEOPLE WHO WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL WEAPONS OF WAR FIGHT THE NAZI WAR MACHINE WITH COURAGE AND THE WILL EMBELLISH FAITH IN ONE'S BELIEF TO OVERCOME THE TERROR OF A GOLIATH TERRORIZING THE UNARMED AND LITTLE PEOPLES CAUGHT IN THE DEVIL'S WEB.
4,I like it,"It has some prejudice favoring the working class/socialists while neglecting to acknowledge the socialists bad deeds. Also, the Nazi party used socialist policies. But the speech in the court room is inspiring."
3,e-selling overview,"An easy read. Definitely worth the money, for the websites I might never have found otherwise, & the interviews w. ebayerswho've found success combining ebay w. other e-selling methods"
4,Good value,"I got this book on Amazon for very little $, and has some good ideas for marketing products on line as well as branching out to different sales channels and what is involved. For the small amount I paid, I am very happy with the level of information in the book to help grow my sales."
1,"POOR. NOTHING REVEALED BEYOND EBAY,","I BOUGHT THIS BOOK AS THE TITLE PROMISES NEW VENUES, BUT THERE IS REALLY NOTHING THEY REVEAL EXCEPT AN EUROPEAN SITE WHICH TURNS OUT TO BE A BRANCH OF AMAZON, AND WHICH IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE FOR AMERICAN SELLERS TO USE. A WASTE OF MONEY"
5,Best for storage of down bags,This storage sack is a good size and shape for storage of down sleeping bags. The sleeping bag is not compressed and the cotton sack is breathable. Easier to store a sleeping bag in the sack on a closet top shelf than loosing closet hanging space
4,Good Book,"Customer service is so lacking in today's society. I think these books would help all people, regardless of their profession. It would be nice for people to treat people!"
5,Dewalt Impactor,So far an excellent impact driver. I used it to drill 1/2 inch holes thru 6x6's with a paddle bit. It did a better and faster job than a plug in hammer drill and did not once bog down. I recommend it highly.
4,dewalt impact driver,"This impact driver is a big improvement over the regular drill drivers. No more stripped out screws or driver bits, it really performs as described."
2,This had a greater impact on my wallet than the job,"This had a greater impact on my wallet than the job. When I saw this item I thought it could be the solution to several projects on the horizon so I ordered it. I had to put up a metal building and had countless bolts and screws to install and I was also preparing to change a bunch of tires for the winter season. On the metal building the tool was good for the small screws and up to 1/2"" bolts but that's it. It was useless for anything larger. So as I learned from the 1st experience on the building the only good it served in changing tires was to get the lug nuts started and snug and I had to use my 4 way to tighten the lugs. Not what I expected from an impact wrench. Just not enough torque."
5,Excellent product!,Purchased the DeWalt inpact for myself and co-worker. Absolutely love it. Should have purchased a long time ago. Recommend the drill chuck if you plan on drilling through any metal or use larger spade bit in wood. Eliminates torque on wrist when bit grabs like a standard drill causes.Only down side (if you call this a down side) is it is too powerfull and when putting in screws it is easy to strip them out.
5,awsome tool,great for cabinets decking and really the most useful tool that i own. I already own the the dw056b but i had to get another one so that i could have two going at once for my work.
5,Yay,"I actually bought this book (and the 4 after it) in France, and it's such a great story (even in french) I'm so glad they translated it and released it over here in America, so more people can enjoy it."
2,"I LOVE THIS SHOW, BUT...",I've been a longtime fan of the show and just purchased the box set on Friday. My problem with this DVD collection is they took out the narration. This may not seem like a big deal but the narration is a huge part of the show. It sets up everything and watching the show without the narration takes something away. Unfortunately this wasn't released directly by The Discovery Channel. I can't think of the name of the company that put it out but they need to recall the DVDs and rerelease them WITH the narration. I can't honestly say I'd recommend people buy this.
1,"I LOVE THIS TV SHOW,BUT!","I HAVE ALWAYS WATCHED THIS SHOW!!!! I DIDNT THINK IT WAS OUT ON DVD UNTIL ABOUT A WEEK AGO. I ORDERED IT AND I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET IT. WELL, I GOT IT AND TO MAKE ALONG STORY SHORT,""WERE IS THE NARRATION?"" THE SHOW IS AWESOME,BUT THE NARRATION MAKES IT EVEN BETTER!"
3,DEFECTED DVDS,"I received this DVD set yesterday from Amazon and it is definitely defected. The narration is missing from these. Obviously the company that released these hasn't corrected the problem. I will be sending my set back. Hopefully, Amazon will get the new corrected version soon. Update: I ordered these directly from the company that released these and the new set is just fine. You have to be careful when ordering used copies of these because you might end up with the first batch which were missing the narration. Otherwise it's a great series."
2,you can watch for free,"The DVD does not tell the whole story without the narrator..After buying the set I discovered most all the episodes are posted on you tube complete with narration, with the exception of a few of them on a later season, but the best ones are there. I would skip buying the dvd and watch them there, or you can record them from tv (they are on every day at 2pm EST)."
1,Uhm...,Where is the narration at? These episodes (16 total spanning seasons 1 and 2) are missing the narration completely! Bare bones DVD set that is MISSING THE NARRATION!!! This is unwatchable! NEGATIVE 5 STARS!I love this show so you can imagine how frustrated I am! Do not buy this rip-off!
3,eccepted what you get on this dvd,"I just got this dvd and i was so excited to watch it. I got the man telling me each storys while watching the show. but the dvd was made poorly. very poorly. maybe because each epidsode is 49min. and there 5 to 6 epidsode on each disc's. it feel like the dvds are dvd-r's? If you are entrested on A Haunting season one and two. eccepted the picture you get,because it look like they download the epidsodes and then burn it on the three disc's. I don't think they will remastered the season one and two.eccepted what you get."
4,Recall on A Haunting,"The audio narration track is missing from this series. The company offers a 100% money back guarantee on your purchase.I called TMZ and they told me they are aware of the problem and are getting new batches with the narration in it.So, for anyone upset the narration ( a key feature) is missing, call:1-800-547-6014 and they will send you a new set and you send yours back to them."
1,Disappointed,"DVD isn't narrated like it is on the television series, clearly a defect. First purchase was replaced, will send the replacement back as well."
2,"Good production value, can't say much about the rest","We purchased this locally for about $10. The quality of the box set isn't great. The outer box/sleeve is thin and too small - the three disk boxes have to be crammed in and I expect that it will be damaged by the time we finish watching the season.. The boxes and disks are not numbered - how hard is it? I looked up the episodes and numbered the inserts and disks. Like the title says, the production value is high - the actors are good and all the little details add to the experience. Beyond that, I have to admit that I fall asleep almost every time we watch an episode. I'm one of those skeptics that likes ghost stories, and these stories are repetitive and predictable. For good reason, based on the subject matter, but I was really hoping for more."
3,interesting!,"i have never really paid attention to this show when it was on tv but when i got the dvd as a gift, i was hooked!!! despite the terrible bad acting in the reenactments it was a pretty good show with a lot of chilling stories!"
3,"THE PROGRAM, NOT THE DVD","I've read the reviews about the problems with this version of A Haunting so I went on line at The Discovery Channel and found they have now released A Haunting, Season 1&2 on DVD! I ordered it and love it. All 5 discs are just as they are shown on TV but without the commercials. The narrator is the same man and the picture quality is really good.The price is higher than the version shown here."
2,Exorcisms R Us,"On the good side, these shows are very well done, with surprisingly good actors re-enacting the stories. The effects are sufficiently spooky too. My only problem - do the hauntings all have to be evil and demonic? And they all start out the same - oblivious families moving into abandoned homes and finding out that they are haunted. Even though they are terrified out of their minds, they insist on staying in these demon-infested dwellings. I love a good ghost story as much as most do, but it's like they purposely showcased homes that have evil and demonic entities. If I had known that, I would not have bought these DVD's. So maybe my purpose here is just to warn some that if you would rather avoid viewing strictly demonic and evil spirited hauntings, don't buy this. Stick with Ghost Hunters. For those of you who get their thrill from watching exorcisms and people being terrified out of their minds, buy this and have a party.Oh, by the way, mine had narration. :)"
5,perfect,"...fits perfect for my 3 yr olds ""first car""..the size is great and he loves it...thanks pops!"
3,disappointed,"I bought this for my 31/2 yr old, and really wondered if they had sent the wrong one. I bought this because I thought that it could fit 2 children. The seat is big enough for him, but the leg room is no good. His knees are really at his chest, and he could not use this for more than another 6 months. I was disappointed, but I guess when you don't try it out (in a store) this is what happens. Otherwise, it's fine but for a younger/smaller child."
2,room for two?,"This looked real appealing at first glance. Then after I read some 'reviews', I took a closer look. If it's so roomy inside- (for two kids?! - I always wonder if the extra glowing reviews aren't left by employees or paid reviewers - this kind of confirms my thinking...) -then how come the LITTLE boy's knee is sticking up near his chest? And he's probably not even three! Look down where his feet should be - there's no room; the wheel well looks awfully spacious for 'lots of room' inside the vehicle. Then I poked around some more, and on one of the alternate images (do people really click on these?), I noticed how teeny (flimsy/cheesy/not strong) the front 'axle' was. Since the questionable reviewers love it so much, I say let them have it. I'm still loooking.New GrandmaNanette Ward"
4,"Very good value for a 19"" wide screen monitor","I was looking for a moderate sized and priced widescreen and there were several choices available. I checked out several monitors - Samsung, Viewsonic, Acer among others - at various stores. The BrightView screen of the HP w19b, its 5 ms response time and overall compact look were significant factors that won me over, plus the immediate availability by mail order! The brightness, colors and crispness of images are all very good. The clear screen (as opposed to matte) has not been a problem - very nice indeed. I have no complaints about the visual aspects of the monitor.The negatives (1/2 star deduction each) are the tilt (some advertisements claim that it can do so but I have not been able to figure it out) and the speakers (they work and the volume control is nice, but are tiny and sound tinny - for real audio get better quality speakers!)I think it is a very good buy for a basic 19"" widescreen LCD."
1,This Is Funny?,"If this is Gen Y humor, it helps explain why SNL is still on the air. ""My New Filing System"" takes the art technique invented by Tom Tomorrow, adds a pointless storyline, stirs in an average of two cuss words per panel, and lets fly. If you subscribe to the school that 10,000 bad jokes might produce 1 laugh, this might be for you. For those who like their humor to be a little more, um, funny, skip this and go watch the chimps throw s**t at the zoo."
5,Astonishing,"It is difficult to understand how such an extraordinary book can be published for such a good price. The production values for this volume put to shame nearly every other book on evolutionary history I own. It is hard to imagine how the authors secured this level of support for publishing a relatively narrow-interest book. I assume significant grants must have been involved.I can only hope that future books by different authors on the evolutionary history of different organisms (chordates, molluscs, etc.) will be afforded this level of support.[Later Edit] Since I initially reviewed this book, it has nearly doubled in price. Evidently the publisher realized he was giving away the store with this one, and increased it to match the market. Still a fabulous book, but no longer highway robbery in terms of its price."
3,"Five Stars Music, 2 Stars for Sound....","You certainly cannot fault the performances and material. After all, this is Patsy Cline and her classic ""Greatest Hits"" LP.For all the hype that this is remastered with state of the art technology (32bit/96k), in most cases the sound quality doesn't quite match that of the limited edition GOLD CD edition or the wonderful Patsy Cline box set from the 1990s - that is unless you enjoy a compressed heavily processed sound.Aside for that, just hearing Patsy sing ""Why Can't He Be You"" is like standing just outside of the ""Pearly Gates"" listening to an angel...."
1,patsy Clines Greatest Hits,This product has never arrived.. I tried contacting this company and they would never respond. They are not a company anyone wants to buy anything from.
1,buyer beware,"I bought this album and was led to believe the songs were song by Patsy Cline. When I opened the ablum I found a notice that all songs were song by various singers, none by Patsy."
1,Patsy Cline's Greatest Hits,"ITEM NEVER ARRIVED, EVEN AFTER 27 DAYS...COMPANY DOES NOT EVEN READ THE QUESTIONS OF THE CUSTOMER...LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE...WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN.."
2,too short.,Not enough cuts and definitely not the best quality sound. Bummed about this purchase. I'd love to get a better greatest hits album for Patsy.
5,Oh that Voice!,"If there is one musical genere I dislike, its Country. Give me some Bluegrass, yet Country music just doesnt reach me. But then there is Patsy Cline, whos voice alone is absolutly breath-taking. Even though these tracks were mostly recorded in the 1960s, I still think that she is one of the best Country singers of all time. Some of the material is a bit dated, as evidence with a little doo-wop thrown in, yet these are a great collection of songs. I encourage people to see to put down thier Britney Spears, Christine Agularia, and Jo-LO CD's, and try on some Patsy Cline for a real amazing voice. No, this isnt going to want to make you groove, but its a voice that has to be heard. This one is a true classic in any music genere."
5,Crazy for Patsy,"I love this cd. Patsy Cline is still amazing after all these years. The recording is so clear. It's like she's right in your living room. I love it, and you will too. Order the cd, you wont regret it. I know I didn't"
5,happy heart,We loved the CD since it has her best songs on it! I am very glad I purchased it as we love Patsy Cline's voice and her songs. What a voice she had!
3,Um...,"To give the book its due, it is a great place to start for beginners; especially if you know absolutely nothing and would like a place to start. The content is excellent as it goes into a variety of areas and explains them relatively well. Quite a bit better than some beginner books that I have read.I prefer books that tend not to lean toward a particular path and this one seemed to lean heavily toward Wiccanism. I was disappointed to find that there was nothing in there that I did not already know, but again it's great for beginners. Considering that depth and substance are lacking, I would not go so far as to say that it's ""The Essential Witch's Grimoire"". Books by Raven Grimassi would be a better bet if you're looking for something that has substance you can get into."
4,A very sweet film,"This movie was made in the 60s, but wears well. It is the true story of the first killer whale ever captured. Better than the Free Willy movies. And if your kids ever saw Shamu at SeaWorld and wondered what Shamu means, it means ""friend of Namu"" -- yes, this Namu in the movie."
1,Don't buy this charger!,It's a POS and stopped working after 2.5 months of use. Pay the extra money and get a quality charger.
5,inspirational,"David is an amazing writer and an even more amazing performer!! Hes an excellent poet and knows what he's doing. He took his personal stories, wrote it down and wrote a top seller =) Even if your not into poetry you'll love this book! I know I dont really read poetry but I swear I could not put this book down!! Its amazing and inspiring and its definatly worth the money to go out and buy this book!!"
3,Works great but very bad packing,When I received this it was just in a box without any packing material. I am sure it got thrown around in the box. This person needs to know how to pack something as fragile as this. Im glad it worked when I plugged it in
2,wimpy,this is good if you have never seen a real laser. Childish geometric patterns only. weak laser strength also. should be $30
3,NOT EXCITING,It's simply a reading of the book. There is no acting involved. I would only recommend it if books on tape is what you want.
4,Weller PTA8 Soldering tip,Good temperature control in a reasonably priced tip. Easy to replace. Expect to replace the tip about every three to six hours of soldering.
2,A rather cheap Army car set,"a cheap army set which clearly takes the regular cars and paints them camoflage. There is a camaflage sports car. a regular truck body with a plastic box on the back to be an ambulance. The plastic bottom is crudly attached to a cheap casted metal top, which I highly doubt will hold up to any child who plays with their cars vigerously. The little floor mat it comes with is a ceap plastic sort of like the one time use table cloths, with a city lands scape on it. I really don't think it's appropirate for small children since it has many small pieces which don't hold up well under any abuse. A rather poor toy, but ok for shadow boxes, and other display like function assuming acturatecy isn't something your looking for."
4,Sometimes working out your issues gets ... messy.,"A depraved, gory, misogynistic cartoon of a film with some giddy performances and increasingly outrageous developments. I think it would have been improved occasionally by attending a bit more to credibility in the villainous behavior as there were times when alleged practice and experience were not born out by competence on screen, but I suppose there was an supply of fake blood that needed to be used up. The focus on interpersonal relationships in their various forms definitely lent additional tension to the proceedings."
3,Raw and Putrid,"Cold Fish features Taeko ( Megumi ) the young second wife of Shamoto ( Mitsuro Fukikoshi) and step mother to his hateful daughter Mitsuko ( Hikari Kajiwara) Mitsuko finds himself lured in to the life of Murata ( Denden), the owner of a fish store.The date and time stamps at the bottom of the screen suggest the decline of Shamoto's balance as he is drawn in to a web of perversion, cruelty and murder in a world created by his rival.During his decline, his family life collapses.A lot of gore in this film, there are times when one is revolted. It is 2.5 hours long but very funny, strange and funny at times. It is a voyage in to perversion via tragedy, comedy but not a dull moment. three stars 12/23/2011"
5,Natalie who? Victor is the Macmaster,"This is an amazing disc, with a good showing by all. I love Celtic music, I love new grass, any disc with Edgar Meyer, Bela Fleck, Victor Wooten, and Jerry Douglas on it is worth buying, even if they were playing with Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson (Uhmm...like I thought a Dobro was like an extinct bird or something....). However, despite the I-just-escaped-from-a-Mary-Kay-convention look of the cover, Macmaster is amazing. The tone is sweet and the speed is amazing. As a side note, Victor Wooten steals the show, he emulates a bhouran (Irish Frame Drum) and also plays a duet with Natalie. Amazing. I would have to agree that the ""master's hand"" is at best dopey, and after wading through the grating lyrics I was disappointed not to hear some kind of killer violin solo. This is the exception though and is easily solved by hitting the skip track button. Awesome album...definitely worthwhile"
3,Powerex AA 2700 Rechargeable Batteries,"I am recharging these with the solar charger.. maybe I'm doing something wrong, they don't seem to hold a very long charge."
2,Doesn't last as long as lower-rated batteries,"I suspect the ""2700 mAh"" rating on these batteries. I've been using these now in identical LED lamps (with similar usage patterns) and other batteries with lower mAh ratings outlast them. Older batteries."
3,Not 2700 MAH as advertised,"When I received the batteries I immediately placed them in my brand new Maha MH-C9000 charger and charged it in the ""break-in"" mode. After the batteries were completely charged it averaged about 2510 mah per cell. That's 7% below the stated 2700 mah. Yes, the label says 2500 mah minimum capacity but for brand new batteries and using a state-of-the-art charger I was expecting it to be very close to the 2700 mah rating. It was a bit surprising considering the many positive reviews and that's the main reason I bought these instead of the Sanyos.Powerex should be more honest in their labeling because the packaging boldly says 27000 mah but on the battery itself it says 2500 mah minimum capacity.Maybe these will improve with further use.After about 2 months and about 3 cycles the capacity has dropped further to 2450 mah average."
1,Not pleased at all,These cells had very short life before they began not holding a charge for any respectable time. I will avoid this brand in the future.
5,A huge step forward in battery technology,Powerex batteries are a next generation product. No longer do you have to sacrifice battery life because this is a 2700mHA battery (which is very powerfull for a AA). I'm using them in a high-amperage device and they last a very long time. These batteries are heavier than Alkaline batteries. The increased weight must be necessary to provide the long battery lifeThese batteries replace alkaline batteries while providing more power and the ability to recharge them up to 1500 times (according to Powerex).We're all trying to go green so buy a few rechargeable batteries instead of 100s of alkalines and save some money while doing the planet a favor.
5,Excellent rechargeable batteries. Well worth the price.,These batteries last longer than any rechargeable I have ever used. I think they are an excellent buy. I use them with a portable bluetooth speaker. With my duracell rechargeable batteries I was recharging every evening. With the powerex batteries it is 3 or 4 days before they need to be recharged. I would not hesitate to recommend Powerex 2700mAh batteries to a friend.
5,These are the best I've tried,"These Powerex AA rechargeables are the best I've tried.I've tried several different brands of NiMH AA batteries (Delkin @ 2900 mAH, Power2000 @ 2500 mAH, La Crosse @ 2600 mAH, Duracell @ 2650 mAH, and DigiCam @ 1800 mAH). I use the La Crosse BC-900U charger on all of them so that I can see to what capacity they can be charged to, and even the La Crosse batteries that came with it can't be charged up to their own stated capacity. Duracell and Delkin both had a dud in each 4-pack of AA batteries. For all five manufacturers, the fully charged capacities of their AA batteries never exceeded about 80% of their stated capacities. None ever came close to a ""full charge'. There was always at least one in each pack (excluding the dud in each pack) that would only charge up to about 50-60% of capacity, which would lead to a premature ""Low Battery' shutdown of my camera.The Powerex on the other hand, all charged to 95%+ of their rated 2700 mAH capacities and really last!."
5,Best Batteries I have ever owned hands down,I shot an entire wedding using over a thousand flash shots with these batteries and they were still going strong.Best batteries I have ever owned!I highly recommend!
3,"They charge, they power","Bought these to use with my Magic Flight Launch Box, which recommends these batteries on their site: [...] Unfortunately, these batteries use a glued label, which has to be removed before use in the MFLB. Lots of rubbing alcohol was required to remove the glue residue.On the up side, the batteries seem to hold a charge longer and don't seem to ""fall off"" as quickly.If it wasn't for the glue, I would recommend these batteries to anyone with a MFLB."
1,PowerEx 2700 - worst NiMH I've ever owned,"I switched to NiMH a few years ago with PowerEx 2300 MAH batteries. Loved them. Since then I have tried Energizer, Duracell, and Rayovac ""Hybrid"" - no problems. But PowerEx was still special to me because it was my first, so I upgraded to a set of their 2700 MAH AA's (directly from Thomas Distributing). Worst batteries I've ever owned. They discharge the fastest of all my NiMH, with or without use. I stopped using the 2700's in less than a year (while my original 2300's are still going strong). Personally I think there is at least one defective battery amongst them that screws up the entire set, but I didn't feel I could prove that for a refund (in hindsight, I should have tried). Will never go back to PowerEx."
2,Inflated specifications,"With a dozen of these, the best I am able to achieve is 2590 maH which is 4% below marked specifications. The poorest was 2460 maH, being 9% low. The average was 2513.I used a LaCrosse BC900 on the refresh cycle which constantly discharges and recharges until the batteries achieve maximum results.By comparison, a set of Duracells purchased 4 years ago were in the range of 2570-2610 when new and they were rated at 2650."
1,rechargeable that will not recharge,"I owned two packs of these batteries. These batteries have amazingly short life time for charge. The charge will only hold for less than two weeks or even one. If you really want a nice long lasting battery, get the enelopes."
2,POWER X BATTERIES,"I PURCHASE THE POWER X CHARGER AND 8 BATTERIES I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE THE NUTS, FOR MY RC CONTROLER. BUT TO MY SURPRISE THE BATTERIES DO NOT HOLD THEIR CHARGE VERY LONG I DO LIKE THE CHARGER.I HAVE HAD THEM FOR 4 MONTHS."
3,Buy better batteries,I have recently experienced failures in several of my Powerex batteries while my Eneloops are still going strong. I no longer buy Powerex and only use Eneloops and recently purchased Energizer rechargeable. The powerex batteries that failer were only about 2 years old and were charged and discharged about 10 times.
2,short life,I bought 12 Powerex AA 2700mAh about 9 months ago. They worked well for a few months but started to hold less charge. I have a quality Maha charger and have cycled them a few times hoping for an improvement. No luck. I take a decent amount of digital photos so recharge batteries maybe twice a month for a set of 4. I have gone back to using my old batteries which are poor but better than Powerex. I can take maybe 20 photos if I fully charge the Powerex batteries immediately before use. I have had many different makes of batteries and started using them when 1600mAh was the best available and all lasted longer than these 12. Not too happy with Powerex! They have been recharged maybe 30 times and were not good after about 20 times.
2,Beware of Micro-Tools,"I purchased two of these items from Micro-Tools on Amazon. One of the retail packs had been opened and re-taped with 4 inches of scotch tape. Is Micro-Tools selling open-box Powerex batteries as new? These should not be listed as ""new""."
2,"Good when new, but lifetime is short.","I've purchased 4 Powerex batteries and a Maha charger, and as part of this package also got a free bonus pack of 4 AA Kodak batteries. The Powerex batteries worked well at first, but after about a year of moderate use, the batteries would not hold charge and were pretty much useless. I've tried using them in a camera and a mouse, but they either didn't work at all (camera), or just lasted for a few days (mouse). As a last resort I tried using them for backup memory in a land line phone. This is a very benign application with a very low current requirement, and yet the batteries would only last a week before completely discharging. The free Kodak batteries, interestingly enough are still going strong, in all applications, and in fact have been used in the same land line phone now for at least two months without a need for a single recharge cycle."
4,For all bird watchers and those interested in evolution,"Very well written tale about the possible ancestor of birds. I should think that even casual bird watchers would enjoy learning the theories of evolution of their favorite creatures. Well researched theories, their plausbility, and their potential flaws are discussed in fabulous and convincing detail."
5,Taking Wing Soars,"This is a splendid book. Shipman has a clear, entertaining writing style but does not sacrifice detail to ""dumb things down"" for the reader. The book covers not only Archaeopteryx but flight in general, looking at the development of flight in organisms ranging from bats and pterodactyls to the Wright Brothers. She does not avoid controversial topics such as the accusation that the best-known Archaeopteryx fossil is a forgery; instead she explains in detail how we know this is not the case. I would recommend Shipman's book not only to paleontology fans but to anyone interested in flight or modern birds."
3,Detailed but inconclusive,"This is a rapidly evolving subject and things have moved on since the book was written.The author has researched very intensively and the book is heavy on facts, arguments and counter arguments. There is however, little to take home with you.I've read extreme versions of the tale including the work by Danish ornithologist Heilmann (birds are proto dinosaurs) and accounts by Robert Bakker (birds are derived dinosaurs). I tend to prefer the dinosaurs are birds argument which is gaining more momentum with every new fossil unearthed, but this book tries hard to be impartial and creates too much doubt. The author does not say what she thinks and why which would have been useful.It is balanced and a good addition summarising our knowledge but there are probably far better works now available."
3,Enjoy The Pics-Forget The Text!,"I wholeheartedly agree with the previous review! The book is LOADED with glaring errors! 3 that come to mind: North By Northwest's famous cropdusting scene was set in Illinois, not Texas, which he mentions more than once. Grace Kelly did not die in 1979 and there is a great picture, elsewhere, of GK and ""Hitch"" at the function this author uses for a reference point of Hitch's dead friends and sad end of life, and he refers to Patricia Collinge as Joseph Cottens mother in ""Shadow Of A Doubt"": She was his loving sister. He also misquotes Psycho and several of the biggest films in AH career. Didnt this guy have a fact checker to help him? He is also very coarse in his descriptions of people in Hitchcocks life: Anthony Perkins looked like a retarded child? I only gave it 3 stars for the rare pics that are included. Buy it when its in the remainder bin or used on Ebay!"
3,Buy it used,"I bought this book despite a couple of bad reviews. I wholeheartedly agree that the writing/translation is not very good. In addition to factual errors, there are sentence structure problems and schizophrenic writing. I am glad I bought the book because there is enough here (photos mainly) for it to be useful to me for my purposes, but this is not a book for the casual or very unintentional. This could have been an amazing book because I think this is a very good conceptual approach to Hitchcock's work. I cannot recommend this book for everyone."
5,Great Value!,"This is the same down blanket minus the satin binding that is featured on a popular tv shopping channel. I know because I ordered it and sent it back when I saw this on Amazon. less and no shipping charge. It is perfect for our Florida winters and as a coverlet the rest of the year. Very pretty and best of all, it's washable."
4,Veggie shapes!,How do you get a child to eat his vegetables? How about these vegetable cutters! This is a great idea to help kids have fun eating their veggies! I would recommend that the cutter have a little wider end for the hands to push down to cut though. Otherwise great idea and works great! Here come the Veggies!
4,"Smaller Than Expected, But Functioning","There stainless steel vegetable cutters aren't much smaller than I expected, but they're certainly not large. I'd say they are about the size of an American golden dollar in diameter and a little over an inch long. They are functioning, nonetheless and I am satisfied with my purchase. So happy to finally have cut carrots to put inside my bento!"
4,Cute little helpers!,"These are small- do not think that they will be very large but in Japan and in the world of bento small=cute and you want them to be small so they can fit into the designs of a bento and any other ideas you many have for it. They stand about 2 inches tall. As some have said on here they are not the sharpest tools on here. Had they had more of a blade like- end they would cut VERY well but at the same time it's good that the ends are a bit duller because your children can help use these tools as well. Regardless, they are a decent price for these cute little things that can help you from anything like creating a cute lunch for your sweetie to making a lunch that even the pickiest child will enjoy eating : )"
5,So Cool!,"These cutters are even better than I thought they'd be! I bought them for my daughter's tea party bithday party, and the carrots and seedless cucumbers I cut with these were a huge hit! The shipping was exceptionally fast, too!"
4,great for making cute childrens lunch items,"I really enjoy these cutters. I use them weekly to cut out cute shapes of cheese and vegtables to entice my picky eater to eat. I was suprized when I got them and realized how small the cutters really are - but I have had lots of fun using them. I even used the star shap cutter over the 4th of july weekend to make stars on my apple pie. If they come in different shapes, I would purchase more. They are easier to use and handle than mini cookie cutters."
2,Bad customer service,"Bad customer service with bad shipmentOnly received 3 of the 4 cutters, but like the productsWarning beware,they will try to make you pay extra for the shipment after your payment.BAD BAD Customer Service BAD BAD"
3,"cute, and perfect for making small dog cookies and crackers","I like the size of these, but I am concerned they will bend with extended use. Aside from that concern, I am happy."
1,Very disappointed,"My vegetable cutters arrived on time but the package had been previously opened. Whoever opened them stapled the package back together. When I say package opened, I'm saying the vegetable cutters look as if they were used. GROSS!!! I threw them in the garbage because I was creeped out."
2,hmmmm...,"let me tell you, the quality is great! but...dont get fooled...they are so tinny! i mean....REALLY TINY!, i though they were more bigger than that :/"
2,Veggie Cutters,The cutters are very small so if you think these are cookie size cutters think again. They are cute but very small for what I was looking for.
4,great cutters,"These are just what I wanted. These vegetable cutters have been easy to use to cut carrot slices into shapes; also, cheese, meat, etc. It has made my kids lunch more fun."
4,a little small,I think they are really cute cutters but they are a little small and may require a lot more work than I expectec :-)
5,The perfect touch!,"This really puts the sparkle in your bento! Worth every cent, and they work great. They cut right through carrot slices without any trouble whatsoever!"
1,Absolute Rubbish,"I don't know how these people get away with making these DVD's. They are not affiliated with Pink Floyd, and really have no idea who Pink Floyd are."
1,false advertising,"I returned this because it was not as expected- The information led me to believe that this was a dvd of the CONCERT- not a review of the band. Would love to find the concert, as it was a gift to a fan..."
4,VL MAXIS gets the job done,"I really like the look of this gun, and the grip. I used it on a woods paintball outing, and let me tell you the gun is solid. It is pretty darn accurate and I had no paintballs explode in my barrel. I also had the VL Quantum electric hopper come with the gun, I thought I was getting the all black but it was actually clear. That was sort of a bummer, but I recommend this gun especially to new players. I took out alot of people the day I used it."
5,Best of Roger Whittaker,Excellent CD. I used to listen to Canadian Radio when I was growing up in Michigan near Sarnia. Hearing these songs after almost 30 years is truly awesome. This is a wonderful disk. His voice is very deep and the songs are very nice.
4,Long time ago,"I'm so glad with this CD of Roger Whittaker. It containts most of the songs I loved so much in the '70-'80. A wonderful warm voice, beautiful songs, a dream of a CD !"
5,Roger Whitaker,I am enjoying his CD's every day. He is one of my most favorite singers. Hope many more purchase his wonderful songs.Marilyn Scott
3,Button is hard for toddlers under 3 to press,"I bought this toy for my son's 1st birthday. He is now 22 months and it is still hard for him to steer it and press the""go"" button. He still has fun with it and I am glad that I bought it, but even though the age said 12 months and over, I should've waited and bought him a bigger one once he got older."
1,Steering is serious problem,Bought this for son when he turned 1 year. He was able able to push the button by 1.5 but the steering does not work. We have taken it apart and put it back together thinking that may be the problem and even put oil on the moving parts. It just doesn't seem to turn well. The mechanism for the steering is flimsy at best -a rod with a hook on the end and its quite frustrating for our little boy. It also gets stuck easy in grass which is frustrating for all. I would just wait till they can drive a bigger version. We are looking at purchasing a 12V vehicle now at age 2.
3,age group,The age group for this toy is not four and up. On the box is says for 12-36 months and up to forty pounds. My son will be two soon and he doesn't fit in it and he's not very big so if you want a power wheels pay the extra hundred or hundred and fifty dollars and get a bigger one that they can use longer.
2,Leaves quite a bit to be desired...,"We bought this toy for our 1 1/2 year old. He didn't get much used out of it before it tore up. It is very small and has hardly any legroom. The wheels do not keep traction on grass so I spent most of the time pushing him. It was fun while it lasted, but anytime my son had other options of something to ride (such as his friends small jeep) he would race for something else. The steering is not the easiest to turn either... a bit easier than a circular steering wheel, but still not easy for a 1 1/2-2y/o."
5,Great fun for my 20 month old boy,"It's a great way for a younger brother to get a Power Wheel to keep up with his older sister. Beware the website suggests the battery and charger as accessories when in fact they are included with the go-kart, which makes it an even better buy!"
4,My Own Car!,My son started riding his go cart by himself at approximately 14 months old. It is super simple for toddlers because there are no pedals- a simple push of the button on the steering wheel will get them moving. The only con I have is that is it small..they will grow out of this quickly. It is hard for them to get in and out due to the steering wheel. I don't forsee any four year old being able to ride in this. The perfect age would be 14 months to 2 1/2 at the most. My son is almost two now - he still enjoys it.. but he will ride the bigger jeep power wheels more often than this one.
1,Yawn,"That's why my 2 year old nephew does when he sees it now.It's slow (2mph) and dull. Only goes 2mph or 0, no in between.Initially he loved it, then the second day came.Currently I'm researching a motor upgrade so that my money would not have gone to waste.Unless you're an uptight overly protective mother don't buy this."
4,"Same Tale, Different Culture","This is a different version of an old folktale. We enjoyed it, though, and the illustrations are nice. There are strong references to God, so if you are offended by that, skip this book. It has a happy ending. :)"
4,"Beautiful images, disappointing text","I agree with the previous poster that the definitive book on this subject has yet to be written. The printing is first-rate, so the images are gorgeously presented, although I wish some of them were larger.The down side is that the text does not go into nearly enough depth on the subject. The introductory essay is just that, a good introduction to the topic, but each chapter (chapters are each devoted to an alternative process) has a short essay which only devotes a paragraph or two to each artist, followed by pages and pages of images which left me wanting to know more.The essay by Chuck Close and the interview with Sally Mann are fascinating, but only serve to illustrate the potential this subject has to offer, but the book doesn't quite live up to.Four stars on the strength of the images."
3,Needs Updating,"This is a lovely little book with a great concept, but it's four years old and sadly out of date. I hope there will be a new edition soon."
2,new version is no good,old version of this product with the packaging shown in the picture was good. the new brown crosshatch pattern package (3 oz bags) version is no good. seems they sold out and went for cheaper beef and/or processing. really bummed out.
2,Mold,"Sadly, I love this jerky and have ordered it before. This time, several packages were very moldy!!! And there are no returns of refunds..I may not order this again."
4,Great taste,"I've just gone through my first box of this beef jerky, and it tastes really good. My whole family likes it. It's spicy, but not unbearable. The sweetness tend to balance out the spiciness. The only problem I had with my first order was that one of the bags was moldy. Must be faulty packaging."
1,7g of sugar???,Great jerky doesn't need to be doctored up with sugar. I really get frustrated with brands that tout 'organic' and still cram in the sugar.
3,Better than Gas Station Jerky; Not as Good as Your Local Meat Market,"Jerky is expensive, but it's a great snack. My wife and I are striving to eat grass-fed, natural beef, and this is the best option we have found to have a handy snack nearby. The jerky is very good, but not great. It's better than Jack's Links or Oberto, but this pales in comparison to the jerky you can get at most meat markets. This is probably the best option unless you can make the jerky yourself."
2,"Way, way, way too sweet","It's my fault. I should've read the nutrition facts and saw how much sugar is in this jerky. It was an expensive mistake. I now have $40 worth of beef jerky that tastes like candy. At first I thought they sent me teriyaki by mistake, but no, it's the original recipe. To me, if the organic beef is so great, you don't need to cover it up with a bunch of sweetness. I want to taste the meat, not the evaporated cane juice. I hate to give this product a bad review as it's just my personal taste. It's not a bad product--it's completely organic with no nitrites. It's tender. It just tastes like a meat lollipop."
3,"decent, not great","This jerky is very moist, so moist in fact that I might not even call it jerky. It has the texture kind of like those beef-flavored dog treats you get. Flavor is OK, but nothing special. I could almost go so far as to call it ""bland"", but that would only be in comparison to other jerkies I have eaten. I prefer a drier, more flavorful jerky -- the kind you have to chew for a while and exercise your jaw muscles. This jerky requires minimal effort to chew before it disintegrates. I like the organic-ness of it, and the ingredient list is devoid of anything scary. All-in-all, it's decent, but I might not buy this particular flavor again."
3,organic beef jerky,"Our family loves beef jerky, and although the flavor is good, the texture was really tough and difficult to chew."
1,Poor quality!!!,"I get it on time, but when i count the total number of them i found one which was full of green hair on it!!!!, cant eat . I am pretty sure that it has gone bad at LEAST few weeks!"
1,Rubbery,"Based on the positive reviews and the organic certification I gave this a try. The taste is very sweet, which from the reviews, I expected. The texture is rubbery or plastic like, not at all like the real jerky I used to get in the south out of the jars in the truck stops. It may be organic, but it tastes like organic rubber to me."
4,Good Sweet Jerky,"This is jerky in a sweet and soft style. It's not tough, or very chewy. Still tasty, though."
3,3 oz package,The product is good but this is 3 oz package.which is much smaller than the package in grocery store.price is not cheaper than local store.
4,"Delicious, but small quantity","I would have given this product a 5 star for the taste and quality, but I gave it a 4 star because it is a very small amount in each pack."
3,Good Quality... When it's not moldy,"First shipment was great. This product is priced really well and tastes great. However, when opening one of the bags I saw that the jerky had some mold on it. When I looked inside all of the meat was covered in mold. The date on the packaging for expiration was mid December 2012, no where near the date. Good thing I didn't eat a piece!"
2,Way too sweet and reconstituted texture,"I would give this really a 1.5 star, but I was generous. It is way too sweet. Others have said the same in their reviews, but I ignored them to my chagrin. It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed. Because it is so thin, there are never any big lumps of gristle, but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces. The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor, the second problem is the texture and meat quality. This is not a very good jerky. Their Buffalo, while also too sweet, is much better as is their Turkey. They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America, so it is a toss up. For the price, I may re-order the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo, but I will never order this Beef again."
4,"Good, but not excellent","Good beef jerky, but not outstanding. Still a slight hint of plastic or waxy texture compared to really fresh homemade jerky. Good deal on pack of 8 compared to buying locally at the store."
5,ORGANIC BEEF JERKY,"Very, very pleased with this product! So much so, I get it on Autoship. It is healthy and has excellent taste. The adults in our family eat it as well as our 3-year-old grandson. A great ""meal replacement""!"
1,Yuck!,I love beef jerky and I've tried almost every brand on the market. I just went to my local grocery that specializes in Organic and All Natural foods and picked up a package of Golden Valley Natural Beef Jerky black pepper. It is without a doubt the nastiest food I've ever put in my mouth....Save your $ buy something else! I'm taking it back to the store and demanding my money back.
1,Stuck to my natural teeth then disintegrated,"I was really looking forward to this purchase because this was a childhood favorite of mine. My how things change. The taste was spot-on but it the gum inside seemed to be, literally, a drop of gum then it fell apart before it could form into gum. This happened no matter how many I ate back-to-back. Please try again and get this one right. Then send me a free bag because I paid $30 (with S&H) for gum!"
3,Slightly Disappointed,"I've wanted this dictionary for quite a long while as most of my fellow classmates were using it last year. Finally I decided to order it at Amazon because my local Barnes & Noble book store did not have it in stock. It arrived in time for my first class this semester. Happily I got it out of my bag and placed it on my desk but then realized that everyone else in the class had a more recent edition. The edition I received was the 4th; everyone else who was in class with me last year already had the 5th edition. Thus the reason for the 3*s--because Amazon did not send me the most current edition. Otherwise, this is an excellent dictionary and I strongly recommend it to those studying Italian."
5,"L""Oreal Couleur Experte 8.3",I was very sad to know they will no longer be making this color. I love the way it looks. Best color I ever used.
3,Nikon Action 10-22X50 Dual Action Zoom XL Binocular with Case,"Not what I expected from NIKON.. The Zoom only works good to about 3 to 4 hundred yards, after that it is blurry & hard to focus. also the zoom lever is not what you would expect from Nikon, it has a very fragil feelin to it. I would have been better to buy it without the ZOOM. If not for the Zoom it is a good binocular, for the price."
5,I Almost Died...,"GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT GREAT... (study,study,study...) :D . I almost died of too much laughing. A MUST HAVE. VERY VERY SEXY and FUNNY"
5,I love my phone,"I really do love my phone/gps/pda. I bought it so I would use my pda (i would never take it anywhere with my phone, I wanted one device). Super easy to use. Sometimes when many programs are running can be somewhat slow, only has Mobile 5.0, and HP GPS software only included trial version."
1,Item received is not the item pictured,"Received the ""upgraded/newer"" model for this tongue scraper, but the newer version is not as good as the original. I received the 3-blade scraper instead of the original triangle scraper with 1 edge. The picture for this item shows the original. It does NOT work as well as the original. Seller offered refund but apparently the SKU number is the same between the original and newer versions, the manufacturer simply decided to change the design without changing the item ID."
1,Avoid - new three scraper design is bad,"Item shipped is new three scraper design not one scraper design as shown, doesnt work well bends too easy. Too bad the one scraper model isn't available because that one worked much better."
1,worst tongue cleaner out there!,"whoever fabricated this junk product shoulde be crucified to death.i bought two of them and used one.it is flimsy and just waste of money and time.i threw them away,including the unused one.i just dont have the time to return it ,wait in line etc.i was robbed by the manufacturer in broad daylight and they have the audacity to keep selling this defective products and duping consumers.how conscienceless are these people!"
2,Too easily destroyable,"I gave this to my lab, turned my back and walked across the yard . . . and by the time I got back she had torn a hole in the canvas and was unraveling the woven rope! It ended up lasting for a couple of days before it was *completely* destroyed, but it was a big waste of money -- especially compared to her other frisbees by Ruff Wear and Bamboo. (She's had the Ruff Wear one for almost two years and it's just fine.)I gave the disc 2 stars because she did like the squeaker inside it (although that probably hastened its destruction); plus, not all dogs are as destructive as mine, so this would probably be okay for a mellow dog. But for a reasonably priced, durable frisbee, go for the Bamboo Combat flying cow toy."
3,LOST THEIR TOUCH,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I PURCHASED THE CD,ONLY TO EAGERLY SPEED HOME TO LISTEN TO THE NEW KLUTE.WHAT DID I FIND?A TOTAL DIFFERENT BAND!KLUTE,BEING HEAVY INDUSTRIAL TO ALL OF A SUDDEN TECHNO!WHAT HAPPEND TO THE KINGS OF INDUSTRIAL.ARE THEY TRYING TO WIN NEW FANS?ALL IN ALL, CASUAL BODIES ISN'T THAT BAD."
2,This cd is NOT Claus Larsen's klute,"I bought this cd assuming that it was the industrial band klute. However, when i played it I found it was horrible, horrible raver music. I am not much of a techno fan, but this cd does have it's high points, however there arent very many. This is not a cd that you'll listen to over and over."
3,Get's the job done,What can I say? Just a cable that gets the job done. Worked for me and I am happy. No complaints here. Company delivers fast.
4,Fantastic First CD - Pretty Darn Good CD2 & CD3,"I very Nice Housey , Dancy Mix. Very smooth and well managed transitions. Great track selection by the DJ.The First Track is amazing and grabs you right away. All throughout the first CD there are some amazing tracks. I only discovered this collection THIS YEAR but it's still great. My fave track is ""Real Love"" Round 50:05 on CD1 and I play it repeatedly. Actually I'm sure the other 2 Cds are great also but I just haven't stopped playing CD1 yet."
1,WHAY TOO FULL OF HIM SELF,THIS GUY IS WAY TOO FULL OF HIMSELF TO TEACH YOU ANYTHING BUT HOW GREAT HE IS THE WAS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF INFO WHEN HE WAS NOT SUCKING HIMSELF OFF TELLING YOU HOW GREAT HE IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A Passion for Desserts,"We love this book! The recipes are easy to follow and they taste delicious. We have impressed our friends at weekly church meetings with our newly found, amazing, baking abilities. We have turned them all on to this cookbook.The recipes are much more interesting than your typical everyday desserts and easy to make. Some of our favorites are berry creme fraiche cake and pumpkin upside-down cake.The last thing we thought we needed was another cookbook but we couldn't pass this one up because we loved the beautiful pictures. Now it's our favorite dessert cookbook and we pull it off the shelf first.With the holidays coming it is going to make a wonderful gift."
2,Disappointing,"I am a CCA student in San Francisco. I needed a dessert for my Plated Desserts class so tried the citrus cake, recommended by another reviewer. It took the better part of a Saturday to make. The crumb of the cake was very coarse and the glaze was thick and would in no way pour, even after I added double the amounts of the liquids specified. It left a distinct powdery, almost dirty, taste in my mouth. I did not use this cake in class. Our class desserts are served in the Bistro restaurant on the 1st floor school's south campus. Additionally I was intrigued by the cookies pictured on the back of the dust jacket. It appears that the recipe for those cookies is not in this book. There were not enough pictures in this book either. At this point, I am reluctant to try another recipe and would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,least favorite Luchetti cookbook,"Her other cookbooks are better,[ I love her Stars cookbooks!]. This was a little disappointing. Her choice of recipes wasn't as interesting, and the selection was small."
2,music did not live up to my expectations....,"a very early album of the band.... and would greatly appreciate samples of the music, as provided on some other cds....."
5,Great Honest Rock,"I was turned on to these guys by early MTV vids.I went out and bought this album and never put it down....time passed//alot of time...and it still moves me,now on cd.Just a well rounded rock band.I hate dating music...becuase its too vague of a label to say this is 80's rock.To me its just good solid rock with good players...well written songs with solid messages,good vocals and harmonies.If I heard it today for the first time,I would buy it.As someone else said...these guys deserved more back then."
5,Kickass rock from start to finish,"I'm sure I'm not the only one who came across this incredible band through hearing ""Last Chance"". That song is an absolute classic and probably one of the greatest songs ever written. So many bands that made it big have nothing on Shooting Star. This band is so under-rated it's ridiculous.""You've Got What I need"", ""Higher"", ""Bring It On"", oh no need to list specifics the entire album is incredible. You won't find any fillers on this one. Much better than any album with one hit and about 5 or 6 fillers and 2 or 3 average songs. Incredible vocals, guitar work, everything...I couldn't praise this masterpiece enough. What's wrong with the world where a band like this could slip through the cracks?"
3,Shooting Star's Debut,"The debut 1980 album from Shooting Star. The first single was ""You Got What I Need"". Shooting Star also shot a rare MTV video for this song. ""You Got What I Need"" got alot of air play on local rock radio stations. AOR stations played ""Last Chance"" which is without a doubt one of the best, if not the best track Shooting Star ever recorded. If your an early 80's rocker, this album is a must have!"
2,Disapointing,"After reading this book, I had to check the photo on the jacket to make sure it was the same Anne Perry who writes such wonderful Victorian mysteries. I found the main character annoying and I didn't really care about what happened to any of them. I'm a big fan of Anne Perry, but this book was a major disapointment. If you are looking for a character like the Pitt or the Monk books, you won't find that here."
2,Left Cold,"This was my first Anne Perry book. It may be my last.My impressions:1) The story plays too many head games with it's characters for a story less than 75 pages. I can't imagine what her longer stories might be like.2) I never felt comfortable with Celie, the main character. Then again, I don't feel comfortable being around unstable people in the 'real world'.3) This story could have taken place during any time in history. The back drop simply made a [bad] story, [a bad] story with a morbid setting."
3,decent,I bought these to defeat a fix it ticket and the material ripped when I installed them because the screw went in too far.Mud flaps are lame anyway but it got me past my fixit ticket.
5,Can't beat the price.,Perfect length and width for my needs. They need a bit of stiffening to keep from 'floating' at high speeds but other than that work great.
3,New Leaf,"I'm giving this 3 stars because I'm not a fan of meat puppets, but New Leaf is my favorite song of 2007"
5,Worth the wait,"""Rise to your knees"" was well worth the wait. There isn't a song on this album to skip. From the first song to the last, this album is complete gold. The Kirkwoods are still at their best, and new drummer Ted Marcus fits perfectly as a puppet. Buy this album now, you won't regret it. I would go as far as to name it ""Best album of 2007""."
3,Instrumental orchestral pieces,"This album sounds like a symphony's pop concert, except without much ""POP"" to go with it. I'm a vocal connoisseur so 1) I miss Cole Porter's witty lyrics, 2) I can't really judge the playing. The instrumentalists sounds perfectly fine for the most part (the bongos in Begin the Beguine are a bit much). There's a 1970s feel to the orchestration; like a blend of soft jazz and orchestral. I can't really explain it - maybe the whah-whah trumpet, the emphasis on flute backup, the similarities to some of Henry Mancini's orchestrations... The actual musical tone isn't as bright as newer orchestral recordings, sound a bit dampened. Maybe someday I'll try to take out the strings and use it as a backup singing track."
5,sheek the great,"I think sheek's album is hot and the lyrics are hardcore. His beats are on point and who he had on his album made this album sound even better. Me personally, I love sheek and I think he is the best rapper/freestyler in the ""L.O.X."""
3,Small and light but optically not up to Nikon's standards,"I was attracted by the power (10X), size and weight. The NASCAR cache didn't hurt either - I think they may become collectable. However, these are neither the sharpest nor the brightest (even at high noon) binoculars I have ever owned. I expected much more from the Nikon name. They come with lens caps and a decent soft pouch so they didn't scripm on the accessories, but the image quality is definitely not as good as a similarly priced pair of 8X Nikon binoculars I bought a few years back. What may have really spoiled me is a pair of Leica 8X's I tried at a local camera store. The pair was significantly more expensive and not waterproof but the image quality was many times better; sharper and with higher overall contrast. For the price, this pair represents fair value but don't expect to get that legendary Nikon image quality. If these will become your only binoculars, I suggest you keep shopping."
1,Macally Optimicro fails miserably,"As a graphic designer with over 25 years experience creating on a Mac, I must say this has got to be the worst mouse I've had save that of the ones Mac supplies stock with their computers. And even they last longer. The Macally OptiMicro is horrible. I've gone through two in the past 5 months. I've normally been content with Macally products. But this mouse has made me decide never to buy Macally products again. Not worth the risk of having a mouse go bad during crucial deadlines."
2,"Nice design, but didn't last long...","Pros: This mouse has a great design, and I love how the casing is clear so that the red optical light shines though and brightens when the mouse is moved. The length of the cord is good; I plug it into the USB on the opposite side I use it on with my Powerbook, and there's plenty of length leftover. The size is small and portable, but still easy to use with your fingertips.Cons: The scroll-wheel on this mouse barely lasted out of the box. It broke almost immediately, and now only works in fleeting moments, like the sensor connects for only a second and then its gone. It would be really nice to scroll through web pages and documents with the scroll-wheel, and its why I rated this mouse so poorly. I would only buy this mouse if you aren't too concerned about having the scroll part work."
1,Mistakes make-believe for True Belief.,"This book is a confusing recipe for turning the clock back to a time that never existed because it couldn't. And if you don't agree with this prescription, Muslims are supposed to destroy you (=murder you?), otherwise the world will remain corrupt. The murderous and repressive Taliban in Afghanistan, sponsored by the author's homeland of Pakistan, exemplify the problems that arise when make-believe thinking like the author's is used as a cover for grabbing power."
3,worth buying,"Glad I purchased this, it was a great price and just about what I expected. 11 episodes of the tv series kind of a cross between the lost boys,goonies,and bat man. It is brings to mind Charmed also although I feel Charmed is quite a bit better. I would think eight to twelve year olds would enjoy it. Good harmless fun and a great introduction to Dracula which hopefully would inspire further interest in the genre for the uninitiated."
5,Good product,For the price this tofu is great. My advice is to get the firmest you can if you plan on blackening or grilling. The softer types simply fall apart too easily.
3,Trampoline,I use this as a jogging trampoline. I prefer the trampolines that use springs rather than this one which uses elastic (rubber) type straps to absorb the shock. But I must add the trampolines with the springs do not last very long for me before wearing out. I have not used this one long enough to see if it lasts longer.
3,strong people needed!,"This trampoline comes unassembled. It takes 3 very strong people to snap the frame into place.The spring rebound when jumping on it, is quite tight."
4,"Bounce, bounce, bounce...","I bought this for my 5 year old son. He loves it so far. It hasn't kept him from jumping on the bed however, but we're working on that. I'm planning on using it for exercise as well. It's small enough to keep inside and fits nicely under the bed. It's lightweight and can be moved easily so you can put it outside in the yard as well. My only con is that I was injured while putting it together. Even though we followed the directions perfectly when putting the two sides together the bar missed the hole and hit me in the shin. Thank goodness it only left a bruise, but two days later it is still a little sore. Do not allow children to help you put it together. You will need 3 adults in ""good"" physical condition to put it together as the directions state."
1,DO NOT BUY,Horrible horrible! A pain to put together and the metal actually bent in half at the joint the same day! What a waste of money and time. I couldn't take it apart because of the way it broke to return it so it was a total loss. Spend your money on a better one!
1,Junk!,"This thing is an absolute piece of junk. Not sturdy at all. You can't move it at all with out it wanting to twist back up and be crooked, meaning you really can't use it for it's intended purpose, which is to jump on it. I read and reread the instructions, I know I have it together correctly, so maybe I just got a defective one, as all of the reviews were good for this. I read them to be sure. Really think I'll be returning this."
2,Very poor quality,"Hard to put together and keep it from bowing. My 4 and almost 2 year old love it, however the plastic blue cover for the springs is awful. It started ripping immediately and never fit right. We bought this for them so I am a little concerned about just taking it off and throwing it away. This is the second one I have gotten. Although I plan on keeping it because it is a hassle to send back, I am not happy with the purchase."
4,springless trampoline,It is sewed together instead of using springs. I wasn't sure if it would hold up but it works well.
1,Be Careful,Perhaps I got a defective product but I ended up in the emergency room trying to set up this trampoline. We followed instructions and were very careful but after putting the main pieces together and wrestling the two sides down flat - it sprang up and hit me in the face with a lot of force causing a laceration on my face and a lot of bruising. The instructions do not indicate that this is a possibility. No product this dangerous should require assembly. Be Careful.
4,Decent product for the price,"I bought this for my two special needs boys (4.5 and 2.5) and waffled between this trampoline and the Galt red trampoline with the handle bar. I decided to get this one because it's a few inches larger than the Galt one although it doesn't have the handle bar which would have been ideal for my 2.5 year old.Pros: Both boys love it. The 4.5 yr old is getting his much needed sensory fix. The 2.5 yr old loves to get on it but because he doesn't know how to jump with both feet off the ground, he just plays or hangs out on it for now.Cons: My husband and I put this together in roughly 20 minutes (it probably would have taken less time but my engineering husband was trying to figure out why the holes to bolt together the trampoline weren't aligned perfectly on one side). The directions weren't that clear and while they had b&w; photos, it would have been nice if the photos were close-ups."
1,Don't buy this...falls apart,"We didn't have problems putting this together, but after only 6 months of use, one band is snapped, two others are hanging on by one thread, and the blue mat is ripped. The heaviest child using this trampoline is 135 lbs., well below the 200 lb. limit. My children loved it before it broke, but what a waste of money..."
1,Did not last a year,"We bought this trampoline last Christmas for our kids. Assembly did not seem to be an issue. The blue cover started ripping after about 4 months. 11 months later, all of a sudden, the frame bent, and the trampoline became unusable. It has only been used by a 3 and a 12-year-old kids (not overweight). Have to find a different model now. My friend has had a 36 inch Gold's Gym Circuit Trainer Mini Trampoline, which lasted so far for two years and has seen a number of teenagers. I guess, I'd go with that one."
2,wouldnt buy again,Have had it less than a month & the legs are bent & one fell off. It is used by my underweight 6 year old.
1,It was Hard To Put Together,"It was so hard to put together, i hard a shoulder pain from assembling this mini trampoline. I find it hard to put together so I'm getting a new one that would be easier to assembly. This is going to the Garbage."
2,Wannabe Trampoline - Easy To Assemble Though,"THE GOOD: Contrary to what many reviewers are saying about how hard it is to assemble this trampoline, I fond that part to be effortless. My guess is the manufacturer made some changes, because I assembled it all by myself without ANY difficulty. It required no strength.THE BAD: It's not a real trampoline. The first thing my 6 year old son said after trying it was ""how come it's not bouncy?"". He wasn't kidding. When you jump on it, it gives a little bit, then you hit the bottom VERY noticeably (the bounce stops and it feels like you're hitting the floor), which after about 20 jumps gave me a headache. It lacks that fun, bouncy, weightless feeling every true trampoline has. I suppose I should have known better, seeing that this trampoline does not have springs. I'll be returning this for a mini trampoline with springs."
5,"Almost entirely what was expected. (previous spring-based product, from long ago, wore out).","Due to the plethora of similar items online, this one was one-of-many. I somewhat expected it to be spring-based, but it is springy-fabric-loop based, instead. Almost as much bounce ( One should maybe stay in the center to compensate.) The directions say 3 persons needed, but are a little terse (unclear) as to assembly. Looking at the pictures, guessing what the captions should be, I was without difficulty able to assemble it unassisted. (Very doable but not recommended--takes concentration, stamina, etc.)Works so well I would hesitate to try out a genuine spring-based item (which I maybe wanted) until this one break irrepairably, if ever.One should air it out, maybe in the garage, for a day or two after assembly... plasticky fumes from the cover, probably. I used a box fan to speed that process up; after a few days it is not discernible any longer."
2,One of the legs for the trampoline is stripped.,"Product is defective. The town I live in doesn't have a store, so I need to return this product as soon as I am able to make a trip to Sandusky. One of the legs for the trampoline is stripped. I'm not very happy about this because the legs are the last thing you do to assemble it."
2,Not a very good buy,I bought this product for my 2 year old son thinking that he would enjoy jumping on it but quite to my dismay after we assemble it we noticed that its not properly balanced.Two of its base legs are not resting on ground which make it unsafe for little ones.I wish I have bought some better trampoline for my kid:(
3,okay trampoline,"I liked the size of the trampoline, wasn't too big and fit on my back porch very well, kids love it and still use it. Only complaint was the outside blue outer covering was not very strong, (plastic, I think) and once it had a small hole in it, that was it. With three kids using it we finally just took it off completely as it made the trampoline look very ratty and dingy."
3,okay trampoline,it only took two of us to get it together. The first time it was warped after we put it together so we took it apart and did it again. On the second try it was fine. Not sure what the issue was. Went together pretty easily....smells something fierce of gasoline which is annoying. It's really just the blue rubber/plastic/foam that goes around the edge that stinks. The entire room where the trampoline is smells of it....hopefully it will be gone in a few more days as it off gasses. Kids don't rebound as high as they did on their kids trampoline but that's okay.
4,The kids love it,"This mini trampoline was bought as a christmas present for our three boys, who have used it extensively since then. As a toy for kids, it works very well. The suspension is elastic bands instead of springs like I was expecting, which makes me wonder about the durability, and I couldn't find a maximum weight limit on it, so my wife and I try to stay off it so as not to stretch out the elastic, but it works great for what we bought it for.Assembly instructions were easy to follow, and hilarious, almost worth the purchase just for those."
5,Quality item!,After receiving the first trampoline with a product defect Amazon quickly sent a replacement. My husband and I put it together fairly quickly and simply. My grandson and I use it all the time!
1,Legs bend easily,"The design on these things is horrible. This was bought for and used by a 2 year old so we're not talking about a lot of weight. First, the circular frame is actually two half circles that are bolted together. The bolt doesn't hold the circle frame flat, so it causes some legs to hit the floor while others are not. When the legs are not flat on the floor, the angled pressure cause them to bend and bending them back risks breaking them right off."
1,Impossible,Unless you have at least three people to help you put this thing together .... you aren't going to. I bought it as a Christmas present for my daughter. Unfortunately I have a disability in one arm and between my daughter and I we are unable to put this thing together. For others it might not be a problem but for us it is very frustrating. We have no strong male family members to rely on and no friends who are able to come over and help us out. The delivery was super fast and I do appreciate that part of it... but I truly cannot say what it is like to use this product. Perhaps they should consider making it easier to put together ... or maybe let people purchase it already assembled.
3,Flimsy,"Purchased this for my 35lb almost 3 year old son to burn off some energy in our tiny apartment when the weather is bad. One of the legs has fallen off already and does not screw back on (but we can still prop it up). The frame is not very sturdy and we're constantly having to straighten it out. It's not very bouncy either as some other reviewers have said. Having said that, my son still loves jumping on it so I think we have gotten our money's worth. I probably would not buy it again."
3,Great product but smells horrible!,"love this trampoline, except for the horrible chemical smell! Kept it in the garage for the first few days and some time outsde on the porch but it still stinks. I have to put it away everytime I'm done which is not what I like to do."
1,It falls apart every time my boys jump on it!!,I am very dissapointed in this product. The last one I bought I purchased from Sears and this one is a mess. My 3 boys are thin and jump on this on the inside and it not even usuable. The washers have fallen out and it falls apart easily!! Not a happy camper!!
2,Not sturdy,The frame bent and cover ripped within one week of opening. My kids are 5 and 7 and rarely break anything. I'd go with a better product and I may try to return this one...
1,Not good,"First let me assure everyone that, yes we did put this together correctly.within a week it looks like it is warped. 2 sides are coming up so much that those 2 legs don't even touch the ground anymore.The remaining 4 legs appear to be starting to buckle in.Obviously the trampoline is completely unstable and unsafe at this point.It's disappointing. My son loved it and is not happy that his mama is taking it apart and sending it away.I am going to try and attach a photo also to show you what I mean...20 minutes later...I can't figure out how to attach an image.Sorry.If anyone knows how and is interested in seeing the pic, let me know (I have a mac)"
5,We LOVE LOVE LOVE this Trampoline!!! :) :) :),"We got this as a gift from my parents. It's such a fun trampoline, my 4 year old son just LOVES jumping on it. We just got it and he already has so much fun on it, my 16 month old son likes jumping on it too with me holding him. It's a little hard to put together, took both my husband and myself to do it. As my husband was putting it together he ended up hurting himself and got a little cut on his finger so be careful. I would definitely recommend this trampoline for others to purchase. It's a must have, you'll have so much fun on it you wouldn't want to come off!! :) :)"
1,Disappointed,"not bouncy at all!!! So disappointed, I was actually looking forward to using this. Also started to tear on the edges. Very difficult to assemble, definitely need more than 1 person. Wish I hadnt spent the money on this."
2,poor quality,Didn't get around to using this much because the frame started to twist right away. Tried to tighten the bolts but it wouldn't stay flat. Finally the joint that connects the two half circles that make up the frame has started to bend....very dangerous. The frame is under a lot of pressure from the trampoline pulling on it....don't want to be anywhere near it if it snaps. Poorly made frame.
2,too flimsy,When I got the trampoline I was surprised that it said that you need three people to put it together. Myself and my little sister put it together. I will say that it is very easy to put together. I came into problems when you went to move the tramoline because the trampoline base will move and fold so when you go to sit it back down it is not level or even with the floor. So each and everythime the trampoline gets moved you have to manipulate it tyo get it to sit straight. It is a hassel since it is moved alot because I bought it for my 2 and half yr old.
5,We love the trampoline!,"Santa brought this trampoline specifically for my 4 year old daughter who is jumping all the time. We figured this would save our couches. So far, it has served it's purpose well and she uses it often and absolutely loves it!It was easy to put together and it's lightweight enough that my daughter can roll it around to a different location.It has been a lot of fun!"
1,Poorly engineered.,"This trampoline is not well made. I purchased one and tried to put it together and couldn't, so I purchased another to see if maybe it was just a fluke. Neither of them went together in a way that they could be used safely. This is one of very few Amazon purchases that have truly disappointed."
4,Springs break often on trampoline,The trampoline is very good for muscle tone and for a low impact workout. However I have purchased 6-7 over the last two years and the springs break at the ends if used often and it is almost as easy to purchase another and cannalbilize the springs from the old one as to purchase new springs
1,Impossible to assemble!,"This product is garbage! My husband spent hours trying to put it together, and he is a very handy guy. He has worked in the construction industry and can usually put things together without instructions. He was ready to throw this trampoline right in the garbage! He said that even if he could get it together, he would never let our kids play on it. It's that bad!!!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Wow, what a let down.No instructions were included. Near impossible assembly. The metal parts were typical Chinese junk. Precision and tolerance are apparently not something in the Mandarin vocabulary.This junk is going back. I'm getting a Needak."
2,THREE PEOPLE REQUIRED TO ASSEMBLE!,"I just received this and was not aware that it would require THREE people to assemble it. I have no problem assembling furniture, I actually enjoy it. But I live alone and it is impossible and unsafe to attempt to assemble it by myself. I have no idea how I'm going to ever get it put together unless I hire someone. I wish I had known the assembly required before I bought it. I would not have gotten it! For now, it sits unassembled on my living room floor."
1,Horrible Purchase,"I was NOT happy with this trampoline. It was impossible to put together safely...and I stopped half way through because I was worried me or my friend would loose an eye. Once I boxed it back up, I called Dick's Sporting Good and they had the same one for the same price and they would assemble it. SOOOOO much easier. It squeeks a little, but seems to be holding up pretty good. But if I couldn't get someone else to put it together I would have gone with a different kind all together. It really is a horrible design if you have to assemble it yourself."
1,EXTREMELY UNSAFE!!,"This product is extremely unsafe to put together. And after the fact, we had only been using the trampoline for 1 week, when the tension began to bend/bow the frame. I am scared that it will snap in half from the tension. It recommends up to 200 lbs. We aren't close to that. Do not buy this product."
4,cheer jumps ;),"Great trampoline for my daughter in youth cheer. It clearly states a low weight limit, so adults should pay attention before purchase."
3,OK for the price- watch out for the SMELL,"First, I am shocked that no one mentioned the horrible smell of the plastic edge liner....three days of letting it it 'out-gas' and it is at least better, but a little dissapointing for a 'fitness' product. Second, the assembly was easy, BUT, you are advised to read the other reviewers feedback. Third, for the price, it's not bad, but the jump mat seems un-even and not as tight and springy as it should be, but over-all, for the price, or for little kids, I would say it was a good enough deal."
4,Value for money.,"I bought this for my son's fifth birthday. He's been bouncing on it for at least three weeks now and it's held up perfectly. I was a little hesitant because it's inexpensive so I thought it might fall apart right away, but I'm glad I got it. It can definitely handle adult use too. I'd rate it as good value for money. All of the legs don't look completely straight, which worried me at first, but they seem sturdy. If they looked straight I'd give it five stars. A good purchase."
5,so fun,I don't know what everyone is talking about when they say it's hard to put together. I put it together by myself and I'm not strong by any means. I love this trampoline. I have hard wood floors and it doesn't leave any marks. It doesn't have springs so it is quite and seems pretty durable to me. I jump around on it while I'm watching tv so it's a good alternative to just being a couch potato.
5,Trampoline,"The trampoline is great for the price. It's not as hard to put together as it seems. My 5-year-old grandson and I got it together in about 15 minutes. He loves it to play on and I love it for exercise. I wish it was a little lower to the ground so I could fit it under my bed when not in use, but it rolls on its side into the corner, so it's no big deal."
1,Bad Idea,"We were very disappointed in this item. It was very difficult to put together. In fact, it even broke during assembly. I am very hesitant to use this name brand again. This was supposed to be a Santa gift for my daughter. She couldn't even play with it and we had to think of some other ""reason"" for her not to open it on Christmas Day. Not at all what we pictured for Chrismas morning."
1,Don't buy this,Do not buy this item. Trying to assemble this was impossible. There were three grown men and weren't even close to getting this together. I'm sending it back.
2,Nearly Impossible to Assemble!,"Three of us, two competent adult women and a 17 year old teenager - looking like a sweaty game of Twister - couldn't put this together. A month later it's still in the back seat of my car, awaiting the simultaneous availability of at least two tall friends with substantial girth, and very long arms... I suspect it will be very sturdy once it's finally completed, but there's got to be a better, injury free way, to ship this to customers."
4,Good tramp,Great for exercise. The bands do not have the same feel as a tramp with springs but they are much safer if having kids play with the tramp. The frame does have a tendency to bend a little at the joint causing it to not sit quite flat.
2,Not what I expected,"Bought this for me, for working out and what not. It doesn't have springs, just stretchy bands. My kids love it, and for the $, I'm happy to let them use it, but I was pretty bummed. I can barely jump on it. It just doesn't have enough spring for an adult. I assembled it myself, though."
2,only lasted two years,"For a product that cost over $100, i would have expected this tramp to last longer than 2 years. The tabs holding the black trampoline floor have started to pull out and i can no longer use it at all."
3,good for the price,after a year & a half of near daily use the webbing is showing signs of splitting - but otherwise has worked well
4,"Tricky assembly, not too shabby otherwise","I suppose it's a little premature for me to review this; we've only had it for a day. But... why not?I bought this for my two young kids, since I don't plan on ever getting a full-sized outdoor trampoline. Safety factors aside, those things do terrible damage to one's lawn.So, I got them this one. And they love it. As mentioned in other reviews, it is tricky to assemble; the instructions recommend three adults. I managed to do it solo, but with difficulty and an element of physical risk. I'm not sure if users are expected to disassemble the trampoline for transport, but I have no intention of disassembling it for any reason.Considering the price, and the free shipping that was in effect when I purchased it, I'd say this is a nice trampoline - especially for kids."
1,Couldn't assemble,"After an hour of trying, could not get the frame to assemble. It may have been bent or misaligned, but it would not go together. The directions call for three adults to assemble. Even with that much help, it seemed like something would break before fitting together. Ended up sending it back."
5,Best purchase ever!,"This has gotta be the best 30 bucks I've spent in a long time. The assembly was way easier than everyone made it out to be and the product works great! A couple things I've noticed:1. It's really hard to be upset about anything when you're jumping on a trampoline.2. If you're a single dude and a girl comes over... she's gonna jump on the trampoline.3. This thing is great for your health. I wear aFitbit Wireless Activity/Sleep Tracker, Black/Blueand I've been racking up points on it like crazy.Get this thing. Jump on it instead of being idle. It will change your life."
2,jump with caution!,"This was a Christmas purchase for my active toddler, so the weight on it is about forty pounds. The construction is such that the legs are inclined to move inward, from the pressure of completed assembly maybe? To ignore the legs moving inward would ultimately result in one of them getting tucked inward, eventually breaking, and well, you try hopping on something that has one less support leg. If there were more weight on it the situation would be ore severe. Would not purchase again, would recommend you not to purchase at all"
3,Review of Airzone Mini Trampoline,This trampoline was difficult to put together. I had to hire someone to do this for me who had to have 2 large people stand on one end in order to get bars to slide in to place. However once it's together it's a nice sturdy trampoline and a very good price.
5,great product,the product was delivered in perfect condition and was delivered on timei'm very happy with the seller.
4,Quiet when in use,This is our third trampoline. The first two had springs which broke quite often. My wife uses this every day and I appreciate how quiet it is and that I won't need to replace any springs. We found it easy to assemble but it does take two people. The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the blue cover did not have holes in it for the legs.
3,Pretty good,"I got this for my children who are 6 and 8. They really love it, but it took a long time to arrive."
3,it broke after 5 months.,"My girls had been given a bigger trampoline and used it so much that it broke after 5 months. We bought this one and the quality/price is awesome! However, my girls don't use it as much as the other one - probably because it is smaller?"
1,No Good,"After jumping on it for 20 minutes by my 6 year old, the outer bars became crooked and the legs are not on the ground anymore. And the threads of the legs are no longer tightening.... sending it back."
1,Not goo,I was not happy with this item. The leg was not steady and keep falling apart. I was looking forward to excersice with this item but it really disappointed me.
2,Poor Product Quality,"Was very hopeful my children could enjoy this trampoline inside during the hot, hot summer afternoons. Unfortunately the trampoline was very difficult to put together. Several of the legs did not want to attach and it seemed warped from the beginning. After just one week of use one of the legs completely folded and bent in on itself. The entire trampoline was completely unsafe for use. However Amazon was excellent and their return system worked perfectly, very fast and efficient.I would not recommend this item to anyone."
3,disappointed,"I just received this product today and I am disappointed. This is exactly the same product that we bought from Academy for $15 less and returned, hoping that amazon will carry a better-quality one.The assembly was not too bad, just remember to hold one half down tight while lining up the other half and insert it. It took about 10 minutes overall.I noticed there are some little holes on the net, hopefully they don't become bigger holes once we start using it."
4,excellent trampoline,This is a great trampoline. We had owned an different one and it didn't compare at all. It fell apart in a couple of months. I'm sure we'll get lots of exercise using this one.
5,SUPER PRODUCT,"I have a 2 year old with low muscle tone and her physical therapist suggested that we get her a trampoline - this one was perfect!! I am sure that some are ""bouncier"" or go higher, but this one is still springy and SAFE!! It is the perfect size to fit inside. My 4 year old loves jumping on it too. I've even used it for jogging in place - a little exercise for mom too."
3,Hard to put together and very loud.,This is a cheap mini trampoline. You get what you pay for. That being said this is great for older kids. I got this to exercise on and I have a hard time because when you jump even lightly the legs bonce of the ground slightly. I feel like if you were going to exercise regularly on on a trampoline I would get a better quality one.
1,poor manufacturing quality,"Bolts and sockets misaligned, sockets already stripped. Tiny, sharp shards of metal coming off everything. Couldn't be assembled. Had to return."
3,wobbly,"I bought this for my 2 year old son. When it arrived I put it together myself. I could have probably waited and got some help. Is very hard to put together. I ordered it because it didn't have springs. I would NEVER disassemble to store. Way to hard to put together and it looked even worse to take apart. Every time I lay it flat for him to jump on I have to get on it to flatten it, and it still seems a little wobbly and uneven. Maybe I put it together wrong!! Otherwise it is great. Has a nice spring to it!"
2,.....Not sturdy and hard to set up!,"We got the package opened it up and read the directions it was VERY hard to set up. On top of that about the 4th time i whent to use it i noticed it was all crooked. I showed my dad and he tightened it to try to see if that worked and it did for about 2 more uses then it started folding up like taco kind of. It's whole frame pops in and out, we tried to take it apart and rebuild it that did not work either i belive that i got a BUM frame or it is just not well built if i even try to jump on it now it bends the upper frame... Not happy about this we are purchasing a new mini tramp!"
2,All pertinent information not up front,There was no information that indicated I needed two to three people to put it together. I had to send it back and I did purchase one already assembled from another company.
2,I expected a better product,"The trampoline doesn't lay flat, I have to pull all the legs out each time I want to use it and make sure it's flat so the legs don't bend. Even then the legs don't all touch the ground at the same time. The screws need continual tightening. I would not get this item again."
1,Why? Why? Why?,Why is amazon selling something that like this that so many people say is very dangerous to assemble??? Look at the one-star reviews - they'll scare the applesauce outa you!
1,mini trampoline short life span!!!,My son ordered this product so that he and his friends could jump before slam dunking his baskestball into the hoop. He used it for about three days staight and then the legs one by one bent back until all that was left was a blue ring on my pavement. I think the quality is very low but for $30 I guess you get what you pay for....
1,Dangerous!!!!,"This trampoline is VERY dangerous to put together. It snapped shut several times while I was trying to assemble it. After finally getting it together the holes where the screws go didn't even line up!! It works fine after you get it together, but the worst trampoline ever to put together!!!"
4,This is fun!,"I bought this because 1) I need to exercise to lose weight and feel better mentally; 2) it looked like it could be fun; 3) It's cheaper, hopefully more fun, and takes less space than a treadmill!About assemby issue: I received it today. I was home alone. I read somewhere on web someone drove on one side with their car, another used couch (not this trampoline, but same difference). Car too dangerous, couch too light, however, I have a decently heavy Hope Chest... I used that as my ""2 people holding it down"" while I pushed down to snap the circle together. TA-DAH! Piece of cake!Read assembly instructions carefully, esp. Step 2 and Step 3. Re-read it. Lightbulb will go on! It's not hard to do. Everything lined up well. Seems very sturdy. Easy to place against wall when not in use."
2,i dont like it,its a good thing to do exercise but is kind of broke already thats y i dont like it n i would love to get a new
4,neatnix,extremely difficult to put together (like the directions state). Once together it is much better than the coiled spring version I've had in the past. Best price on the Net for this item. Larger bounce area than others of comparable size. Like the blue cover.
4,Great entertainment for a preschooler,"We gave this to our son for his 3rd birthday. He's already enjoyed it, but I think it will come in even more handy this winter when he's stuck inside. His 10 month old sister loves it as well. She climbs up on it and sits and bounces."
1,Disappointing,"This product had no value to me and I had to ship it back. Very disappointing. A poor imitation of a genuine rebounder, it has no elasticity whatsoever and of course, no springs (I knew that part). The picture makes the center of the product appear elastic, belying the truth. Don't but it unless you like the hassles of shipping stuff around and losing a few dollars in the process. Spend more and get the real thing."
1,Horrible,"This was a Christmas gift and before the day was through, the frame was completely bent. My kids are fairly small and should not have made a huge impact on it. Also one of the legs was stripped by the end of the day. Poor quality."
2,Falling apart after one day,"After one day of being out together, and only being jumped on by our 40 lbs 5 year old, the legs on this are already bending. Poor quality."
2,Very HARD to assemble,"Very inconvenient to assemble. No way one person can do it. This item comes as a kit, not together like other mini trampolines on market. I would not recommend this for use."
5,Excellent,"My 6 year old loves this trampoline. She bounces throughout the day. It is sturdy, and perfect to keep a kid busy. They also say it stimulates their brain in a positive way- play therapists often have them. I am grateful. Love it!"
5,Great mini tramp for small children,My granddaughter (aged 3) fell in love with her great grandmothers exercise trampoline and spent hours jumping. This made a perfect gift for her birthday that she really loves to play on.
5,Clown Fish (Under the Sea),My niece LOVED it ! Very simple and colorful pictures. This will help her father with picking out a new fish for his reef tank
4,Classic Ellis Paul,Don't ask me why but 'm at the point where I long for the older style Ells music. The collaboration here with Vance Gilbert is very enjoyable. Hopefully one of these years they'll see fit to travel around together for awhile and delight the audiences.
2,poor quality,This tug toy feels like it's made more of plastic than rubber. My dogs had it broke into pieces within seconds.
4,interesting stories,"quite interesting book, mostly liked Jack London's autobiography and Hawaiian lifestyle of old times. Recommended to read for those who are interested in Polynesian culture."
4,Tales of fascinating characters from old Hawaii,I thoroughly enjoyed this series of short stories about many characters of old Hawaii. It's a glimpse into life in the early 20th century in a place that many call paradise but which also contains some of the most interesting people and stories. Jack London lived in Hawaii for a time and his perspective through the eyes of Hawaii's people is unique.
3,Stanley's Mad Arrogance,"The author does a decent job here, but I kept asking to what extent it was worth doing. Stanley proves to be a self serving, vain, even repellent character. It was hard to enjoy a journey with such a companion and hard to see that his journey, difficult as it was, could be said to be of importance.This book is paired with The River of Doubt, which is far superior. In fact, I noticed in the 25 similar books list several candidates that I've read recently that were more enjoyable books, among them Blood and Thunder and Mayflower."
3,Get the newly revised and updated 2011 version instead!,"Please be aware that this is an old 1999 edition of SMART MEDICINE FOR YOUR EYES. There is now a totally updated and fully revised version published by Square One Publishers. The 2011 edition is now ""the"" best and most up-to-date version of Dr. Anshel's work on behalf of alternative eye care. Go ""look"" for it . . ."
4,Tithe review,"I liked this book because it has a lot of different things that I like. The book had mystery, adventure, and surprise. The book flowed really well from the start to the finish. The genre of the book is a fantasy fiction. I love the books that are true but have some stuff that are make-believe.Some stuff that is make-believe in the book is the faerie things. Like her imagination, everyone thought she was crazy. But, she might be telling the truth. In this book you found out a lot of things about Kaye. She finds out a lot of things that are life changing. Some of those things are major and some are minor changes.The moral of the story was to live life as it goes by, but don't screw it up. Kaye is a really big alcoholic and ""chain smoker"". There was a lot of drinking, smoking, sexual contact, and violence.So the over-all review of the book is that it was good. But the things I didn't like were the violence and the sexual contact. So I recommend this book to other people."
5,Clap for these faeries and they might bite you,"In this dark faerie tale, Kaye Fierch, a teenager who has always believed in faeries, discovers that she herself is one, and that she is the sacrifice chosen for the tithe, a blood ceremony made every seven years to bind the solitary fey to the Unseelie Court. Kaye learns to control her glamour, gets help from her fey and human friends, encounters some nasty beasties, and finds romance with a dark knight of the Unseelie Court. If you like Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series, Tam Lin tales, or any story where the teenagers are fierce and the faeries are fiercer, pick up this book."
4,A Wonderful and Well Written Book,I thought this book was a great book. I would recommend it to any fantasy lover in sixth grade or older. This book gave me goosebumps and gave some great ideas for a new story. I hope that when I grow up I write a book as good as this one.
5,A fabulous book for adult and young adult readers alike.,"Tithe is an exciting book, particularly from a new author, and I was so absorbed in the plot I finished it in under a day. Black has a highly detailed touch when it comes to description, particularly when describing the differences in human and faery senses. Her dialogue sounds real, and the actions and reactions of her characters ring true. I eagerly await her next book."
1,dull and occasionally incoherent,"The book has no spark of life, and limited originality. Characters act without reason - stumbling from one mess to the next, creating little blobs of action rather than a narrative arc that spans the whole book.A lot of the reviews say this book is very ""dark"" and the world of the fey is terrifying as well as beautiful. I was disappointed to find that while there is a fair amount of vividly dark description, Holly's fairies essentially think and act like humans. They aren't convincingly different or other. This pretty much negated any impact that all of the dark and dangerous trappings might have had.The character of Roiben disappointed me as well. He's a lynchpin of the book - it's his sexual energy that is meant to charge the book, and he is also Kaye's primary liaison with the world of faerie. He's a make-or-break character, so when he became just as dull and human as the other fey in the book, I really lost interest."
2,Overrated,"I found this book total and complete fluff. While it is readable, and fairly easy to get through, the plot, characters and themes irritated me. The characters were either unbelievably angsty or unbelievably dumb, the main character holding both these qualities in great abundance. The writing itself was poor at best and most of the plot was taken from other stories and/or predictable. Those people who don't mind large amounts of angst or ""why is she being so stupid?"" moments won't mind this book, but if you are looking for a quality book, this isn't it.I give it two stars because it is readable (I was able to finish it easily), but there is not much else positive about it."
1,Disappointed,"I read this book in one afternoon. Doing research into the UnSeelie Court I thought it'd be interesting to see how they fare in the modern world. I was disappointed because there still is that lack of ""faerie evolution"" that results in the fey NOT being bothered by iron, church bells, etc.As to the story itself - interesting but not unforgettable. Would like to have seen a little more development between Corny and the UnSeelie Prince other than a seeming reference to sado-masochism. Oh well . . .that's life."
3,Something is missing...,"This is definitely not the typical type of book I pick up. It tells the story of Kaye (a realistic teen...up to a point) who discovers upon moving back home that she is actually a faerie. Her ""make-believe"" childhood friends fill her in, because, surprise, they are faeries as well! She unwittingly finds herself involved in the middle of a faerie war between the two courts- the Unseelie and Seelie. She also is strangely attracted to a mysterious knight named Roiben. The whole story was very dark, and while I didn't outright dislike the book, I felt like there were way too many loose ends that needed to be tied up."
3,Its entertaining - but not the fantastic book I expected,"I enjoyed the story and the characters, there was humor and fantasy, both good and bad. However, parts of the book read as if the story was written for a teen, and than other parts were for a more mature audiance - this was a little annoying for me, I am 50 so I would have prefered the book being written for more of the a mature audiance. If there was a second book with the same characters, I would read it, however it appears that the other books are totally different stories and characters.I would recommend the book, but not give it the 5 stars the other reviewers did."
2,Part of it was good......I guess,"I was pretty excited for ths book after reading the reviews, it was presented as a gritty somewhat reaslistic portrail of a teenagers life with dark fantasy added in. A very cool concept that was just poorly executed. The story was interesting for sure, but it took almost the entire book to get it going, and then you just dont care anymore. It sets up the 2nd book to be the actual starting point while pretty much just wasting this book as filler. I would ignore this one, but thats just me. I finished it simply because I paid for it not because I enjoyed it. I did like all the people in the book though. They were well defined and very fleshed out. One of there strongpoints"
3,Not a children's book,"Alright, this was a generally good book. It has the basis for a great story with a decent plot; however, after reading and buying this, I felt that it could have been better developed. There seemed to be a strong lack of imagery; the reader couldn't really imagine it that well. Not enough description. There were also several times when the book became very confusing due to the general style of the piece and for the lack of background information.I would also like to emphasis the lanuage in the book. While it is listed as a young adult book, and is deffinate not for adults, it is NOT for young kids. I was shocked by the use of cursing in this young adult book; cursing that would get a movie an R rating.I would recommend this book, but not for purchase. Check it out from the library, but again, beware of the lanuage."
2,This book sucks,"Anyone looking to read this book should reconsider. It's a dry, overly detailed piece of fiction that sounds like almost any other work of faerie fiction--and when you take that into consideration, the others are MUCH more worth your time. Simply, this novel is trash about a stupid girl who gets tricked into helping the wrong people, abuses drugs and alcohol, and wants to sleep with a ""knight""-type faerie.Other, more interesting books to try are: The Moorchild, The Forgotten Beasts of Eld, Artemis Fowl, and/or The Blue Girl."
2,Blah,"Oh god. This book is for emo kids who think their lives suck, is what this book is for.The story was unreal. I was just not at all interested in it. I am sorry if I rather like a happy life that a sulky, whiny one. O:<This was one of the books I got mad at myself for buying before reading the first chapter. This is one of the books that I will never finish reading.The main character is like some dumb smoker dirty girl. And then she's going to somehow save us all from a dark faerie. Excuse me, but I'd rather be saved by Michael Jackson.Okay. And it must take SOMETHING for an editorial review to mark it's faults. Out of all the books I've seen, I've only seen maybe two that had the editorial review straightforwardly tell the faults of a book, even when it was a book that didn't get many good reviews from other people.OBVIOUSLY that must count for something.And oops. I gave it 2 stars when I only wanted to give it 1. ):"
1,Trash,"This book is total trash. Warning! It does not belong in your childs hands. I could not finish reading it, because it was totally not what I would want my students in high school to read. Lots of bad language. Even the name of the band that the main character's mother was in was filth. Of course I know this will excite some people. A total waist of money. This book doesn't even warrant the star I had to give it."
1,"discussing, disturbing, dreadful trash","My daughter thought this book was about fairies. Page 1, Kaye took another drag on her cigarette and dropped it into her mother's beer bottle. She figured that would be a good test for how drunk Ellen was-see if she would swallow a butt whole. Page 9, ""You know what the sun looks like?"" Kaye asked. There was only a little more than a slice of red where the sea met the sky. ""No, what?"" Janet said, holding the lipgloss out to Kaye. ""Like he slit his wrists in a bathtub and the blood is all over the water."" My 13 year stopped reading this trash at this point and apologized for having wasted my money."
5,~*Tithe*~,"Sixteen year old Kaye thinks that she is a normal girl, who just had weird things go on around her sometimes. She travels from town to town with her mom's rock band. After an incident with her mom's, now ex-boyfriend, they have to move back in with Kayes grandmother. As a child Kaye played with faeries, whom now that Kaye has gotten older just thought were her imaginary friends. But now that Kaye is home she sees that they are very real. Kaye uncovers alot of things about herself. This book really is a modern faerie tale! It was great and not just your typical plot either. It is a must read! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
5,A True Fairie Tale Indeed!,"Being a big lover of fantasy stories, I am always on the lookout for a good story about fairie-folk that isn't too girly. This is an intriguing, edgy, and dark journey into the world of fairies. It's like the movie ""The Lost Boys"" meets a classic Brothers Grimm tale. It's sexy and it's smart, I can't wait for the sequel!"
3,Fun read,"I really enjoyed this story, though I thought that the author could have put more thought into making her characters likable-it's not good when you don't care about the fate of anyone involved. I love old Fae lore and this rings true as a fun spin on the old stories. I hate the new cover the old one was sooo much better!"
2,"Dark, cold faery story - not for those looking for a fluffy tale","Short & Sweet Review, by Michelle:I don't know what it is about Ms. Black's writing that didn't appeal to me. I guess, if I had to put a word on it, I'd say that her writing style is very ""cold"" as is this alternative version of reality/the world of the fae, that she has created. While I have read multiple books by Ms. Black and enjoyed them, looking back, they just are ""okay"". I appreciate that the faery world can be a cold and dangerous place, but I like my main characters to have a little more warmth than Ms. Black's characters provide."
5,Tithe : A Modern Faerie Tale,This is one of my favorite books ever! The teens aren't tamed little children and that is what makes it modern. The faeries are wild and cool. I just love this book and can't get enough of it! It is definitely worth the buy.
1,A little RACY for our teenager! Not recommended,"We understand that kids need to be able to ""read up"", but this is just a bit much. Explicit to the point of annoyance. The main character is 16, but this is not even something I would want a 16 year old to read. We have watched movies with the kids that are rated ""R"" with sexual content, but if this were a movie, We would would not be sharing this with them. I will be sure to read more of books that have received similar notoriety before I buy it for a young adult."
5,One of the best books I've read in a while!,"I completely loved this book. Holly Black is a genious. While I was reading I felt like I was there, like I was the main character. If you like romance-fantasy or vise versa I highly sugest this book. It's full of imagination and creativity beyond belief. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. You can read it in one sitting, you wont be able to put it down even if you try. When I read it my eyes were glued to each page."
4,Further Tales,"It is important to note that this book is not a continuation of the previous story. There are new characters and a new story. Yet, the story is still interesting.Also, this is a more mature story than Spiderwick. The experiences are darker, as is the world she creates.A wonderful read."
2,"Compelling Story, Poorly Written","I found the story itself to be fascinating. I actually wanted to see where it was going. However, the writing was not particularly good. In fact, there are many gaps where you have to just piece the story together. (And not in the clever way- it just felt disjointed and thoughtless.) There was nothing special in the way it was written- in fact, I happened to like the story despite the way it was written. However, I won't be reading more by this author.I was also disappointed with the foul language. If you are a parent, know this book contains underage drinking & smoking. It also deals with homosexuality and teen sexuality (in a very, very small capacity). The main character is also a high school drop out, though that seems neither condemned nor condoned in the book."
2,Not really about faerie,"Though the book is intriguing in itself, I found myself let down on many occasions within this book. The plot line is actually rather depressing, and if you're not an emo hate-my-life distraught teenager, than i think all you'll get from this book is a bad memory.Though the author writes this beautifully, with great voice and nice prose, the plot lacked anything to make it engaging and I found that i was forcing myself to finish it just so i could get it over with and done. The characters are thin, with bad personalities, and even the vivid and embellished settings don't make up for worst thing about this book. A lack of grandness.In the end, though the plot is resolved, i felt like saying, ""Great job everyone, but everything that you did was done within an area of about one square mile, and even then it was kind of cheesy and weak. I bet that there's something even worse just in the next square mile.""It just let me down."
2,so not what i was expecting,"After reading Valiant by Black, i was really excited to read this. I was highly disappointed. Writing is bad, characters are not believable or well formed, storyline is not engaging or believable i know its fantasy, but the way the story plays out is just not very believable. She could not suspend my disbelief and draw me into this world). The whole time i was wondering how she could write such drivel after a stunner like valiant. Even if i had not read valiant, i would of disliked it.A good idea for a story, but written and executed oh so badly.don't bother. Read valiant."
2,Wasn't all that great.,This book really got me bored. I would read like twenty pages and then forgot what I just read and would have to reread it. I was expecting it to be a great book from all the reviews I read and was sadly disappointed. I don't think it's the worst book ever but it's certainly not the best I've ever read. I didn't even bother reading the rest of the series.
2,WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME,"I love Faery Folklore and I expected so much more from this book. I am disappointed with the characters. They are dull, shallow and mundane. I couldn't connect with any of them. Kaye, the main character is supposed to be special, but nothing in her character is special. In the end she's a hero but she's not heroic. It's about a trashy disfunctional group of people, drinking, smoking and to be completely honest, disturbing. I also felt lost many times as to what was going on, thinking I might have missed something but it was just badly explained. The author has a great imagination but I think it could have been so much better.I was really shocked to find out also that this is a book for young adults. I don't think it carries any good message to the youth and I think it makes it sound like doing stupid things is cool."
3,"Interesting story, but not for the kiddies...","While I found the story and characters interesting, I think the author, publisher and most of the reviewers should be ashamed to promote this as a book for young readers. It just isn't. There are lots of rather adult themes in this and it's ""sequel,"" Valiant, primarily underage sex and casual drug use. These simply aren't subjects that are appropriate for kids ""12 and up"" when they're presented as being without implications or consequences as they are here. In addition, the language is rather adult. These are better suited to an audience perhaps not quite so malleable or impressionable who can discern what's right vs. wrong. These are adult books.With that said, it should also be stated that the author needs a better editor -- the writing here needs a lot more polishing. Some of the prose will just make you choke on its immature attempt to be clever and adult. Interesting, perhaps good, but could be a lot better."
3,Good idea....but ended up ehhh,"When I read the premise of the book, I thought I would thoroughly enjoy the book, and initially I did. As the book started to get more into the fantasy aspects, I found the writing to get more and more choppy. Additionally, the level of depths to the characters was pretty poor. Everyone seemed kind of flat. The book did seem to have a lot of ""adult themes/language"" it isn't anything different from what a kid sees/hears at school. Overall, I was really disappointed with this book, maybe my expectations were too high."
2,It was just ok,"I was so excited to read this book since I love fairies, and mystical creatures but I felt this story was kinda confusing, and boring..... It got better towards the end, but I did not feel I connected with the characters at all.. Finished the book last week, and I already forgot most of it....... Just my 2 cents"
2,"Good idea, bad execution",I picked this up as a starter book in a book club I started with my girl freinds.... I was disappointed. The story idea was cute and could have worked.... but it just didn't. I can't really love a book when I find typos or even worse... when they say at the end of one chapter that she fell asleep with her clothes on and the next chapter she wakes up in her pajamas.... :(
1,confusing and too many loose ends,"The story started off well, and I enjoyed some of the imagry descriptions Black used to describe the heroine's world. But then it just got too confusing. The story started moving without a clear reason why some things happen, and the story ended with me being really unsatisfied b/c there were wayyy too many loose ends.**spoiler warning**Like, the whole *quote* Solitary Fey had became free for 7 years and are causing chaos to the human world *end quote* issue did NOT get resolved. So Roiben became the King of the Unseele, so what? Janet dies for seemingly no reason other than to get a funeral at the end. Is Kaye going into the faerie world or stay with her mom? What happened to her mom?! Who killed the Unseelie Queen?**spoiler over**Overall, I was really disappointed with this story b/c I feel Black seems to be trying too hard to make this story an anti-faerie tale that the story was in shatters."
1,Don't waste your time...the book is as foul as the language in it !,"Foul language, sexual content, drugs, drinking....this is an adult book written about a teenager, not a YA book. It should'nt be in the YA section at all. There is hardly a paragraph without the 'F' word in it. The author seems to be completely going for shock value, rather than real dialogue. The characters seem to have no redeeming qualities to make me like them whatsoever. Don't waste your time....trash"
2,Dissapointing...,"Being an avid reader of fantasy, this novel was very lacking. The plot was good, but the style of writing could have come from an eitgh-grader. What was missing was better writing skills, which discreetly completes a book. If you have ever read an anime novel, this is very much like it. Not good quality whatsoever. I suggest Eragon, or The City of Ember."
3,A Good Start into the Faerie World,"This was the first faerie book that really dealt into the realm that I've actually read. Tithe is a good book to use as an introduction into the faerie world. There was great creativity going into setting up the imaginary world and the people who reside in it. Kaye is a very intersting girl to get caught up with since she is an intriguing individual portrayed outside of the faerie world. My only wish would be for there to have been even more development of the characters. We got to understand what they are about (Kaye, Corny and Roiben), but I felt myself wanting to know more about them; such as, their backgrounds and emotions."
1,NOT What I excpected,"I chose this book looking for somthing similar to Libba Bray's A Great and Terrible Beauty, and discovered this book. It was not what I was expecting. It was a little to graphic, too many swear words, and all together an embarrasment to be reading. As I read, I felt completely disgusted and couldn't even finish the whole thing. I suggest that if your looking for a book similar to A Great and Terrible Beauty, try something like Blue is for Nightmares. But DONT read this book."
3,Tithe: A Modern Faerie Tale,"This book could have been better. It has a good plot, but I just didn't like how it was written. It seemed like it went by too fast. Certain important things weren't described enough, and when something dramatic happened I didn't feel like anything special was happening, because it was all written the same way.Still, the story was good. I might read the sequels, but I think that depends on whether or not I get to them."
1,YUCK! I hate the foul language!,I honestly didn't get very far into the book due to foul language. Just though other potential readers might want to be aware.
2,Other people have done this better,"I was honestly rather disappointed by this book. Yes, it had its moments, but the shallow characterization and objectionable elements overwhelmed them for me. I won't get into the storyline, so as not to spoil it, but any book that has strong hints of sadomasochism doesn't belong under teen fiction, in my opinion. If you want to read a great novel that comes under the heading modern fantasy then pick up Emma Bull's War for the Oaks, a much superior example."
1,Really bad...and not for younger teens,This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever spent money on. The plot was a rip off and has been done better many times. The characters were shallow and I felt at times I was listening to some lame stoner talking about how messed up he got last night. The language and some of the sexual references make this a book not for young teens. But the fact that that book is just plain awful makes this a waste of time.Beware.... bad bad writing.
3,Err...why?...,"Ok, I don't understand why everyone liked this book so much. I didn't finish it, but I had no motivation too. The book just doesn't flow. It goes from scene to another, ignoring important details. The storyline is somewhat interesting, but the author really needs to improve her writing skills, because the book is very hard to follow. It also kind of annoyed me how sleazy all of the characters are. I'm not saying they should be perfect little rolemodels, but...really. For me to say a book is immoral, it has to be pretty bad, cause I don't usually say things like that. Well since everyone seemed to like this book soo much, maybe I will finish it...=/ Maybe I'll come back and write a better review once I have...maybe not. =/"
3,It's an OK quick read,This is an enjoyable read if you do not feel like reading a deep thought provoking novel. Not too many brain cells are required to get through it. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I was 15 not 26.
5,"Amazing book, one of my favorites!","I absolutely love this book. I've read it about 4398403 bajillion times. I think that it is very well written, Holly Black is so creative. I have to admit that I fell in love with Roiben. I strongly recommend reading this book!"
5,Very dark and suprising,"This series is among one of my favorites and even though i dont like the idea of fairies, i was very interested in this book. 'Kill you dead' fairies, is what this book had and i loved every page. I will agree it may have gotten alittle over the top with the gore and horror but it worked for this book and thats what the theme was. It is not a book for everyone, it shows the darker side of life, which most people like to hide away."
2,Entertaining but unsatisfying.,"While I did indeed enjoy Holly Black's Tithe, it was as a brainless read. I found her inconsistent and choppy style of writing very unsatisfying. Things in her novel happen without reason and are entirely irrelevant to the plot, the main character seems distant and rather dumb in that the reader never gets to truly understand her thinking, her reasoning, her actions, anything, and everytime something happens, Black describes the event quickly and we never really learn the aftermath of the event. The book skips from scene to scene without explanation. I wish Black could elaborate more. Characters are killed off randomly for no reason, and the ones that weren't killed off, I couldn't connect or empathize with. Overall, a good read, but not one that I would recommend."
2,struggling to get through this one,"I hate when you pick up a new book and within a few pages you realize it is becoming a chore to get through each paragraph- I am trying to get through to where the fairies become more prevalent, but it is slow going. I guess for a young teen this might be an 'amazing' book, perhaps I am just old- but being that I have been immersed in some great vamp novels recently, I thought a foray into the fairy world might be good- so far, not so good. Many of the passages so far are trite and not intriguing at all- I care not a scrap for the main character or anyone in her world... I will press on through at least another few chapters, but it won't be easy. (I have to comment on another reviewer's crack at Disney- those saccharin sweet fairies, like Tinkerbell, were created for the enjoyment of 5 year olds- try to keep it in perspective. Remember- these are fantasy characters, so if some prefer them blonde & cute with a touch of sparkly lime satin- to each his own!)"
3,Coming of age tale getting stale....,"The theme is common: hard-bitten young girl on the edge of society, in this case a 16 year old daughter of a rock musician who smokes her breakfast named Kaye, who discovers who's not really human. In fact, she's a pixie. And, she's pivotal in the next war between the Seelie and Unseelie Court. Emma Bull did a much more original rendition in ""War for the Oaks"" and I think it may be more appropriate for the younger audiences recommended than ""Tithe"""
4,"Really good, easy to read, I wish there were a second!",At first when I started to read this it shocked me because it talks about smoking drinking and has a lot of swearing. After reading a chapter I was hooked and read it in less than a day. I loved the story line and the ending made me want more but I would advise parents to make sure their child is over 15 or 16 because it was intense to me and Im 22.
2,Good concept....poor execution,"I really wanted to like this book. The concept was very interesting....entering the world of scary, evil fairies. The book started off good, with some interesting characters, but then it just got lost along the way. I could barely finish it."
3,"It's okay, but ...","Opens like a grungy, depressing War for the Oaks (Emma Bull). Much of the book continues to echo Bull, given the younger protagonist and differences in a few plot points. Death of a character seems more gratuitous, less integral, than in War for the Oaks."
1,Awful,"If I could I would give this no stars!! As I started reading Tithe I had to do a double take. Was this really a book for young adults? The language, the content and lack of imagination worthless. It was shocking to me that it received a YALSA best book for young adults. Shame on the Young Adult Library Services Association. This is just trash.I am an adult and read youth and young adult fantasy/scifi because I don't have to worry about the content being offensive. I believe in reading to elevate ones creativity, not throw it in the muck and mire. Parents be warned this is not appropriate for young adults."
1,Yuck,"I was appalled. My 11 year old daughter read this after reading the Spiderwick books. What a horror... I had no idea. Why is this in the YA section? It should be in the trash. She said, ""This book is a piece of garbage and no grownup should even read it. It doesn't belong in the library. No one wants to see images that I got to see in that book. They'll stick in my mind forever. They are dark and an evil casting shadow. Stick with the books that aren't dirty."""
3,"Not bad, very readable","I like this series although it is by no means ""classic"". I find the main character believable simply because he makes such bonehead decisions. The guy goes from one dangerous move to the next, follows a lot of blind hunches, and generally gets his but kicked once per book for his ignorance. He is far from the slick, LA/NY private eye that so many authors use. He really isn't all that intuitive. In this book he doesn't figure out the real deal until the final chapter and then what does this 49 year old do about it? Something else dumb of course, he gets in a bar fight with two guys.But I find the books very readable, a stretch in the believable department, but quick and entertaining reads.If you want a whodunit full of slick reasoning PI intuition then this isn't for you. It's more about the character than anything else.And yes I agree with some of the others, his self pity gets pretty annoying. But that makes him more real in my book. Sounds just like some people I know."
4,A Review from Nowhere,"I live in Nowhere, Michigan...just south of where Steve Hamilton sets this novel. I enjoyed the novel, as I have enjoyed all of Hamilton's Alex McKnight novels, not only because of the setting, but also because Hamilton is a darn good writer! You don't have to be from Nowhere to understand the need to isolate yourself in the beauty of Northern Michigan, and to fear and resent the greed which drives men to murder each other and despoil the environment. These are the themes of Steve Hamilton's books: weave them through an engrossing plot line filled with action and intelligence and you have this latest in the Alex McKnight series--and perhaps the best."
2,Enough already,"Get the man some Paxil and a good job. It gets to be too much. There is a great deal of difference between skillfully crafted noir-ish pain and sheer wallowing self pity which some seem to think means ""They are senstive"".Same complaints. Stereotypical characters, dull unwilling PI who really needs to find a good meat packing plant to work at. Keeps on just missing with a plot that could have been great as a vehicle for a good noir or Hardboiled PI. Poor Alex. Undercooked."
5,north of nowhere:,"i thought it was a very good mystery novel. having lived in the Soo, it was fun metally visualizing the businesses and locations of his crime scenes and other places in the book. cant wait to read his second novel."
3,A Real Hit !,"Alex McKnight is off again on another adventure in the Northwest parts of Uppper Michigan and Canada. As with all of his mystery writings Steve Hamilton gets the reader involved quickly and keeps the reader turning pages with additional intrigue. The story has a number of twists but really starts rolling after the first hundred or so pages. The action and questions continue to mount until the last fifty pages where the plot becomes clear, but the who done it is not revealed until the last five or so pages. The book is an easy read and a clear story to follow. However the reader needs to get half way into the book before the real story starts. Up until then it is mostly background setting for the real plot to come and the reader can become bored reading through the material. However once the story does develop the reader is in for a real treat in reading."
2,Thirsty?,"The song ""Never Would Have Made It"" is a song of towering meaning and strength. I simply love it; however, the rest of the songs on Marvin's CD are sort of ""off."" I can't quite explain it, but I can say that there is absolutely no way I would have purchased this CD had, ""Never Would Have Made It"" been on there. The other songs on the CD were not musically interesting. It's really bothersome when you purchase a CD and find only a couple of songs out of 10-12 worth really listening too. It appears to me as if Marvin needs someone else to write his songs. He has a beautiful voice and I expected so much more from him than what was delivered via this CD. Maybe it's just me, but I only enjoy listening to the one major hit."
5,Awesome and Encouraging,"This cd is a must have. I have shared this cd with family and friends. If you dont have it, you have to get it today. You will be awesomely blessed. Pastor Sapp showed up and showed out on this one. It is definitely a worship cd. He preached at my local church last week and was talking about how he lost 3 important people in his life within a 90 day time period and his faith was truly tested. We can all relate to test in our lives especially unexpected ones and that is when we really need to draw closer to God. Well I have really been extremely blessed by the cd so I think it would definitely be worth the investment towards your future. Thanks."
3,It was alright,"This isn't the best Marvin has put out but it wasn't that bad either. Through half of the CD, I really enjoyed the songs and it puts you in praise and worship. Tracks 7 thru 11 were dreadfully boring and I found myself using the skip button. Towards the end of the CD it got better with ""Never Would Have Made It"" and ""Rivers Flow"". This was an okay effort done by Mr. Sapp."
2,I'm still thirsty!,"This cd has some good songs on it. But in general, it is rather mediocre. I am a great fan of Rev. Sapp's past work. This was my first Marvin Sapp purchase. I am sure I will probably buy something in the future. But this cd was a disappointment.Also, this is simply a personal choice, but the minister's attire on the cd cover makes him look like a pimp. When the body of Christ begins to understand our purpose in being in the world, not of the world, will we be the force that God intends us to be in this world."
5,"Magnificent, Awesome and Diverse Project","I have been a Marvin Sapp listener for years and while I enjoyed all his CDs, this one has been the most powerful one for me. I love the lyrics and his diverse music style is great. He uses violins and all other types of musical instruments in his arrangements and makes you feel like you are at a live concert. There is something for everyone whether you are a praise lover or worship lover or BOTH. It's all here on this CD. I would highly reccomend it! Great job Marvin Sapp. You are a blessing."
4,"""Thirsty""",ThirstyIf you a fan of good praise and worship please add this CD to your collection. Pastor Sapp has a style like none other. He bridges the gap between modern gospel and traditional-type gospel well. You won't be disappointed with this one.
4,Thirsty,I have bought all of Marvin Sapp CD's to date and this is another good effort. I have to admit that it took me a little while to appreciate all of the other songs on the CD and can undertsand why people might find them a little bland. 'Never would have made it' has obviously BLOWN UP BIG TIME in the states and has created a big hype for the CD here in the UK. My favourite is 'Let the Rivers Flow'. but the CD is definately anointed and a good buy... don't get it twisted...God Bless
4,get ready,"since i have nothing to compare this with i think this is a pretty good cd. i wanted a ""rare earth"" cd and this one is satifactory. has pretty much everything i wanted to hear. easy to order, easy to pay and fast delivery (tho i do live in the same state as ""amazon"" )"
1,Dont buy,"Easy install, easy uninstall. Opened window on freeway and it blew off. Lucky it did not cause an accident behind me.Piece of CRAP."
5,ONE OF THE BEST FORMS OF MAGIC,THE BOOK IS THE BEST SORCE OF EVIL INCANTATIONS AVABLE TO THE PUBLIC TODAY BUT I CAUTION THAT YOU DONT SHOW HATERED FOR THE EVIL IN THE BOOK EVEN WHEN NOT USING IT FOR THEY KNOW ALL AND ALL THE PROCTION COULDNT STOP THERE RATH
1,Bear did not work,"The toy I received was defective and did not work. I thought perhaps the batteries were just old from sitting on the shelf, so I changed the batteries in both the bear and the remote, but still nothing. I don't know if this is indicative of a widespread problem with the bear or just a fluke defect that should have been caught by the shipper. Either way, I sent it back and did not order another one."
2,funky eyes,I ordered A little stinker bear and when I recieved it the eyes were not lined up correctly. One eye was in the correct place the other was on it's nose.
1,broke within 5 hours,bought it for my nieces for christmas and they cracked up for a few hours. then it stopped working. replacd the batteries but it was broke. junk. made 2 little girls sad on xmas day. and i wasted $20. shame on you!
3,"Funny, But poor remote","It has the feel of a good quality, soft Teddy Bear. The recipient commented on it immediately. It is also quite amusing and the light-up cheeks of embearassment definitely add to it. However, the remote is too cheaply made and the bear must have a direct line-of-site for the remote to work and also must be very close to the bear."
1,Not satisfied at all,"The product we received was not working at all. We went to supermarket to buy new batteries, and it still did not work. It has been 3 weeks and I had not received the credit yet."
4,Double the use,I ordered this overlay as an afterthought when I saw a picture of it on the website paired with the lyrical skirt. I love it! I wear it on top of the lyrical skirt and it looks as good in person as it does in the picture. But I also wear it with a leotard/tights/catsuit WITHOUT the lyrical skirt and just the overlay and it looks just as good!! Two looks for the money. Well worth the price!!
1,Didn't work with my Treo 300,"I figured it would work with my Treo 300 since most accessories seem to work with all Treo flavors. However, it would charge, but the hotsync did not work."
4,It is still good.,"This is a classical textbook in Econometrics.Other reviewers have talked about its content, so I will express my opinion only.Its audience is primarily for undergraduate students taking the first course in Econometrics. For this audience, it is difficult to find a competitor, because the book has everything you need to run a regression in a very straighforward way. That's why sometimes the book gets dry. However, it's fair to say that it is perfectly feasible to learn from it.Yes, the matrix notation make the things difficult, but there is no other way if you want to learn well Econometrics.The sequence of tests are presented very well.Although overall the 4th. edition is better than the 3rd., I think the authors should have left the chapter on matrix in the body of the book and not in the appendix.I'd say that this book is even better than Greene, and the next book to be read is Ruud."
3,a bit dense,This is a good textbook for a graduate level student but if you're not familiar with Econometrics it might be a little hard to catch up.
5,Love this DVD -,Your DVD saved me over the holidays!!!! Just love it.Planning on starting each day with the 10 minute session. Perfecto!
5,my bain de soleil,i thank God I found this sun tan lotion they dont make it anymore. I remember back in the 80's when this came out the model in the commercial was pitch dark and that is how i get with this lotion. the orange gel of this attracts the sun plus im olive skin and european so we tan easily. Im so glad i found this lotion. i wish they never did away with this lotion.
3,Same quality as Finger Paint set,"Decent tub paints. Wish they came in the 5 colors that the finger paint set has. They ""paint"" so so, but are easy to clean and my son enjoys them."
2,not so great,soap has a consistancy that makes it difficult to work with. gooey and clumpy. I will not buy this item again.
5,Must for all guitarist,"It's a must have for all the guitarist, new or old. Though you can survive without it, still it's better to have one to maintain your guitar..."
3,"Good, but there is a better value",These are great products but for the same price you can get the same three products plus a fretboard cleaner and conditioner and cloths. Just look for the Dunlop maintenance guitar kit
5,Still the Bayou Ruler!!,"I was attending my 16th Festival Acadienne in Lafayette, LA, in September, 2003, when I heard each song on this album performed live at Grant Street Dance Hall. The audiance went wild after each selection. He said this CD can't be bought anywhere near here tonight, so if you want it you must buy it here. Knowing I had to have it I chose instead to not stop watching the show and wait until later. He was right, I couldn't find it in the weeks to come."
1,"LOONEY TUNES: GOLDEN COLLECTION, VOL. 1-5","I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE ABOVE ITEM - YET! AFTER CONTACTING THE SELLER, I WAS TOLD HE SENT IT ON DECEMBER 1, 2010 (I ORDERED THE ITEM ON 11/30/2010)AND IT STILL HAS NOT ARRIVED. I ASKED HIM TO SEND THE ITEM TO MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW SINCE IT WAS HER CHRISTMAS GIFT AND I HAD PLANNED TO TAKE IT WITH ME TO HER IN CHARLESTON, S.C. ON DECEMBER 27, 2010. THE SELLER SAID HE WOULD SEND IT TO SOUTH CAROLINA. WE'LL SEE!"
1,so awesome,"SUPER LAME.product pictured isnt exactly what you get.... it was heavily used.... infact, still has dirt on it from last weeks pay session.arrived inside a dirty pizza box with the greasy cardboard that comes usually wrapped with the pizza. all wrapped in a brown sack. figure included.... lol code name : chunky pizza bitz"
5,classic unknown western,"lance henricksen shines in his performance as an outlaw who comes back into town to help his one and only true love.he finds out that he is the father of a 15 year old girl,and decides to save the day for her and her mother.the love intrest is played by kay lenz who was in the movie house and married to david cassidy for a while in real life.excellent movie that tugs at your heart."
2,Did I Fire Five Shots or Only Fifteen?,"I love Westerns, and I bought this movie because I also like Lance Henriksen's acting, but this movie could have used a consultant or an editor. In the scene where his daughter eggs him on to show her how fast he can shoot, he is so good that he actually accomplishes the impossible and fires fifteen shots at a tree branch from a revolver that only holds six shots. Why not have him shoot a laser gun? Or ride a pink horse with wings?"
5,THE WAY IT SHOULD BE,"This is one of the few action flicks, western or modern, where the hero doesn't hesitate to kill a bad guy. Too many movies show the good guy trying to give the opponent a chance to back down when they don't deserve it. Of course, the opening gunfight is an exception as the younger brother is being goaded to his death by the older one.All in all, a great Western with a great hero.BY THE WAY, WHO'S THE MORON SELLING THIS DVD NEW FOR $623.00? IS HE CRAZY OR WHAT?????????"
5,Gunfighter's Moon,"This movie is my favorite western movie of all time! Frank Morgan is a legendary gunfighter who is called to help his old love who is in trouble. Frank follows his heart and is detertermend to help his old flame and his daughter. What follows is what adds to his legendary reputation. What happens at the end of the movie is a very moving moment when his daughter, who thinks her father died in the cival war, realizes that her father is still alive and is as much a hero as her mother said he was and is proud to have him as her father! This movie is a must for a western fan!"
1,Most overpriced DVD ever!!!!,Great movie. Saw it on cable. Most overpriced DVD ever!!!! $99 used! $150 new! Are you kidding me?!?!
3,The other America,"I wasn't blown away by this book. Very well known book , but I was expecting more. I would have to judge it as just all right."
5,last true album,"been an atmosphere fan for a long time. its all sunshine ,ford 1 ford2 blah blah blah . i feel this is the last true album slug has made, not that all others are not good.but there is a frustration on this album thats not on the others .I read he didnt want to use people and others situations on you cant imagine and stuff like that.but listening to this again just made me...blah blah blah .forget it this is the best atmosphere album. buy and play it over and over.thank you."
4,Withstands the test of time,"Seven's travels is one of those albums that is more than the sum of it's parts. A lot of the songs have an interesting sound, and it takes a little bit to get used to it.Songs like ""History, Reflections, Los Angeles, Denvemolorado"" all are unique hiphop."
3,"Hmm, The Wrong Comparison....","These comments show your somewhat limited exposure to the vast, expansive world of underground hip-hop. Go pick up these other albums first so you have other underground albums to compare seven's travels to...binary star - masters of the universej-live - all of the abovezion i - mind over matterreflection eternal - train of thoughtgang starr - moment of truthcommon - like water for chocolatethe roots - illadelph halflifeyou'll see what i mean. seven's travels is fun. it's entertaining. it's a good listen. it's not on par with these other masterpieces. please do it, it's for your own good, and you shall soon see the light"
3,Nothing like expected,"i have every atmosphere cd to date. and seven's travels was the most disappointing. slugs lyrics are up to par, but some of ant's beats are too commercial sounding. if your a true atmosphere fan you'll still pick it up, but i don't think it compares to the other cds."
2,nothing spectacular,"unlike his other albums, he dips his feet into the murky waters of the mainstream; he gets overly emotional and his raps go awry on tracks such as ""trying to find a balance.""an overated album that showcases a rapper who is always crying about something"
3,"I won't bad mouth this album, but","if you want to hear Slug's best work, you should pick up the Dynospectrum album (Gene Pool raps his a$$ off as well) and Overcast. God Love's Ugly has some ill tracks (i.e. Give Me and Shrapnel). Seven's Travels is 50 % buttcrack (I mean, half-a$$)."
2,Atmosphere turns mainstream,If you're a an Overcast! fan or slug's real underground old group Headshots you won't appreciate the album that much. Seven's Travel is for people who are just getting started to listen to Atmosphere. Seven's Travel is mostly for Atmosphere posers who think they know real underground hip-hop. By the way Slug is half white half black not full white he's a mullato.
2,sad release bad dub,"i have been a long time fan of slug and in my opinion the only decent release he has had since lucy ford was the felt album he done with murs.atmosphere is becoming a group for little suburbanites and mtv heads..no doubt, slug is probably one of the best lyircist of our time but the production on sevens travels seems to have been created half heartedly.overall, i was dissapointed. and what even dissapointed me more was seeing a commercial on t.v. for sevens travels...slug mys well go on tour with eminem. i hope epitaph don't ruin sage."
1,Please No.........,"Dont buy this album, please, its for your own good. If you like atmosphere, buy one of their two classics: Overcast or Lucy ford. If you're new to hip-hop and dont like hip-hop that offends you or makes you think about white privilege or other such uncomfortable subjects of this inherently political movement, there are many other much better groups out there. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this album and this hiphop-turning-punk ""movement"" that slug's got going on. there are worlds and worlds of great non-offensive underground hip-hop out there that blow this album out of the water. If you're not afraid to have your horizons pushed a little, i would suggest such older groups like Boogiemonsters, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, A Tribe Called Quest and newer groups like Black Star, Cannibal Ox, and Binary Star. thank you"
2,not good,"this is definately not atmospheres best. it is his worst actually. godlovesugly is much better. lucy ford and overcast! are the best though. headshots:se7en i have not heard yet. dynospectrum is sum of slugs best work too. best songs on seven's travels are:trying to find a balance,birds sings why the caged i know, gotta lotta walls, key to life vs. 15 min, and always coming back home to u is probly slugs best song yet.check out sage francis, his new one is good but his older stuff is better too"
1,Definitive Faux-Hip-Hop,"Essentially, this is ""Hip-Hop"" for people who normally would never listen to Hip-Hop. This is the kind of album, which as a hip-hop fan, is recommended to you by your friend who normally listens to fall out boy because he knows you're into hip-hop.This is a very feminine, wannabe-poetic attempt at ""intelligent rap"". The lyrics are mostly Slug's complaints about girls.The beats can be almost decent on some songs, but are generally diluted by some kinda of ""artsy"" elements.If you want hip-hop that isn't about money and violence, please don't think this junk is your only option.Atmosphere and the whole rhymesayer's posse are making underground hip-hop look bad. Yes, I said it."
1,Downhill since the start,"Hey, if your just commin around to atmosphere, dont connect to this album. If you just found out about him, check out LUCY FORD EP. Even tho Slug isnt that great of a rapper, lucy ford is a good album. I recommend you at least check it out."
1,hip-hop for rock fans...,"unfortunately, regardless of any musical merit this album might have, it does not qualify as hip-hop. trying to find a connection between slug's personal anecdotes catering to suburban caucasian adolescents and the origins of hip-hop in the boogie down bronx is nearly impossible. this is cultural appropriation at its finest, taking an art form from another culture and making it one's own by changing and altering the art. it is personally sad to me that the history and basis of urban struggle upon which hip-hop is based in being lost in this fake punk-hop. you want hip-hop? go pick up liquid swords, daily operation, illmatic, return of the boom bap, resurrection, or one of the other thousands of classic albums that reflect urban struggle and racial oppression, elements of the inherently political hip-hop movement that are nowhere to be found in this well-intentioned rapper's album. listen to something that makes you feel uncomfortable, push the race card, dont run from it."
4,Solid Album but...,"Seven's Travels is a solid album, no doubt. Much better than most of the releases today. But it's my least favorite of the Atmosphere albums. Maybe its a personal bias, but I prefer the dark and sad 'atmosphere' of their previous releases. It's really a joyful and happy 'atmosphere' in Seven's Travels. If you don't mind this, then by all means cop this album.Basically if you are an Atmosphere fan since the beginning, you might be disappointed with this album. But nevertheless, it's an essential album for the Atmosphere hardcore fans.I personally believe Overcast to be the greatest Atmosphere album followed by Lucy Ford, God Loves Ugly and then this album."
4,Mediocre Atmosphere...,"...but still better than top-40.Anybody who's listened to any Atmosphere knows what they're about. They have something deep to offer the serious music listener (even if he isn't usually a rap listener... myself included), but something different from what he's used to. Slug is on the same intellectual plane as Andre3000 of OutKast (sorry Big Boi...) but Atmosphere's beats aren't as catchy, so these songs require a more active listener to truly appreciate them.Sadly, though, on this album, the reward isn't always as great as you'd hope for. ""Shoes"" is deceptively deep, as is ""bird,"" and ""Reflections"" stares at the same blurred lines the aforementioned Andre references repeatedly on The Love Below. However, as anti-mainstream as you'd like to feel listening to this album, you can't help but hear occasional echoes of both Everlast and Eminem in Slug's voice. That disappointment aside, this disc will still save you from the radio for a good while."
5,Minneapolis,"Yo, This CD is hella tight, and the song always coming back to you is one of the best from Atmosphere of all time. If you like atmosphere, or anything like Atmosphere then you should definetly check out the Unknown Prophets. I am not kidding, if you dont believe me, download the song never featuring no other than slug himself and it will make you a believer. The best hip hop is coming from Minneapolis these days."
3,"not the best, but still a good listen","I got into Atmosphere with the ""God Loves Ugly"" album, and then got hooked on their eariler stuff. ""Seven's Travels"" is not as good as those. While I really LOVE some of the songs, the rest are hard to listen to. I definitely can't listen to the CD straight through. If you're a fan of Atmosphere, check it out. If not, check some some early stuff first."
4,mpls hip-hop kickin it,"Atmosphere does it again! Maybe not quite as good as God Loves..., but worth picking up. Haters from the coasts need to realize that some damn good hip-hop is being made here. These guys, Brother Ali, Heiruspecs, Mel Gibson & the Pants, etc. Definitely some good *#$@ goin on here..."
4,"Not as good as earlier albums, but still on target","Atmosphere have once again put together a spectacular collection of songs that any true fan of hip-hop can appreciate. It's a bit of a shame that most of the songs on this album will never see radio airtime, but word-of-mouth is plenty to keep them afloat. The fist track and single, ""Trying to Find a Balance,"" sets the tone for the entire album; playful at times, serious at others, with touches of philosophy and self-examination to fill in the rest. As many reviewers have already stated, one of the best songs is actually the hidden track, ""Shhh!"" Anyone who grew up in a small town will instantly connect with it as much as someone who grew up in Slug's neighborhood. The final track on the album, ""Always Coming Back Home to You,"" is by far my favorite; taking a more serious look at life and love. Do yourself a favor and give ""Seven's Travels"" a listen, and while you're at it, check out the rest of the Rhymesayers catalogue."
3,Falling Off the Radar Screen,"Atmosphere is a talented hip hop duo, as illustrated by previous works like ""Overcast!"" and ""Lucy Ford."" With an emphasis on not just beats, but lyrics as well, Slug and ANT have turned many people on to the underground genre. But this dismal CD just does not sit right. The production is far different from their old albums and Slug's style doesn't accompany the songs very well. I understand that they are trying to make a name for themselves by signing with a punk label and experimenting with a new sound, but for god's sake, go with what works. I have listened to Atmosphere for years and cannot get enough of their older CD's, but it is sad to see that this sub-par album gets more attention then past albums on which they really shine."
5,Classic,This book is a classic. Cohen does a wonderful job in revealing the evolution of Dominican and Franciscan theology concerning God's chosen people--the Jews. It documents the ignorance and ugliness essential for to the advancement of replacement theology.
2,not what I thought,"I thought this was new material from the upcoming series or something to do with the movie. But, this is a collection of previous cartoon appearances. Was I decieve into thinking this was new material by the advertisement? Or was I overeager to get the newest DC comics cartoon?"
1,Piece of Junk!,"Although advertised as new, this battery drastically lost its capacity after only one month of light use. Initially capable of sustaining charge for about 72 hours, now it has to be energized every day. One of the worst batteries I've ever used."
5,Huge Hugh!!!,Beautiful live album with a sparkling Masekela and terrific performers. The music of Hugh bring the listener in the heart of Africa; the recording is very high to rate and let us catch the breath of music. Excellent product!
5,Let us continue the fun!,"The second volume has 10 episodes just as good as the first. Many of the guest stars would pop up later on in the 90's as main characters in their own movies and TV shows. Geordie Johnson does a great job as Dracula, bringing out both his humor and powerful intelligence.Sad to say, the series came to an end, right when it seems to be developing a future. Episode Klaus Encounter of the Interred Kind, with its interesting development and focus on Dracula's hidden powers suggest that the show had more promise and if left to continue...Oh well, what is NOT to be is NOT to be.Enjoy!"
5,Great portable dog crate!,"This Midwest soft crate is very easy to set up and easy to carry to wherever with its carrying case. I bought this for my agility dog to take to trials so she would have a cool comfortable place to stay while I walk the course or am just relaxing. I love the roll up window flaps for ventilation and the ability to close them so my dog has privacy. I would recommend this to anyone traveling with a dog that is crate friendly and it would also look good set-up in the home. I give this crate an ""A""."
5,"This pendant looks, feels and is worth more than I spent",I love this panda pendant watch. It is beautiful. The watch has an elegant and easy to read face which to me is the most important thing about a watch. I would never sacrifice style for readability. The design of the panda is eyecatching and so simple and sweet. I was so impressed about how comfortable and substantial the chain is that comes with the watch.
1,Save Your Money,"I got this and some other Hellmuth videos shipped by mistake. The seller, when told of the mix-up, sent the correct merchandise and said that I could keep the Hellmuth DVDs as compensation for my trouble.This whole series is just terrible. If you want a series of DVDs that cover the fundamentals, I can suggest the Ultimate Poker series with Vince Van Patton. They're pretty good.Avoid these like the plague."
5,Like a welcoming hug.,"I must say this was one of my wiser of consumer investments so far. After a long day this down blanket feels as though I am slipping into a warm hug without a weighty feel. It seems to adjust itself to the temperature one's body needs as well, never leaving one not to warm or to cold, just perfect, snuggly and secure. It is very well made to last for a many years to come, soft but sturdy reinforced seams with much thought put out in its design as it appears to be tailored for one's bed. This blanket has been a welcomed delight to our household since the day of it's arrival."
1,Bad Battery,I have had nothing but problems with the battery used on this laptop. HP gave me the run around about it until I was no longer able to return it for a replacement.
4,"More, please...","When I finished this (much too short) story of murder and sex and greed and...well, it's got just about everything in it, I wanted more, more, more! More stories about the cavalier O'Hara and his colorful plotmates. More stories about other characters O'Hara met when he was doing his ""time"" at the country club lock-up. And more of the same juice that kept me turning page after page after page to see what ugly heads would arise next and just how O'Hara would handle situations that almost guaranteed he'd end up ""sleeping with the fish."" It's obvious that Author Jim Ryan knows his way around the judicial system, big government and the underbelly of life, and understands just how tight to weave the tension to keep his readers intrigued throughout. More, please!"
2,Not So Good,"This jerky sounded pretty promising.It has a great price, and they use quality beef and no chemicals.When I got it, however, I was very underwhelmed by the flavor. It was too sweet, and not spicy enough. Also, when I got done chewing on a bunch of it, I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit out.Pros:-They use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibiotics-None of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerky-Texture was good, but not great-Good priceCons:-Not very spicy-Sugar is the second ingredient, making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could be.-Beef cuts a little too fatty.I would definitely not buy this flavor again, and I would probably keep looking before considering another bag of Golden Valley Jerky."
3,"Good quality, low taste","I'm a big fan of almost any mammal jerky, and also of not going to the store. I ordered this based on the description and it arrived very quickly. The Good: It's excellent quality and well packaged. The Bad: For me, it was seriously lacking in flavor, and I'd say nearly tasteless. It had a slightly sweet flavor, but very little salt, brine, or much else in the way of seasonings. Conclusion: It's high quality and a decent value. I'll try a different flavor based on this, but I will not order this flavor again."
2,"started well, ended poorly","I'm not a jerky connoisseur (and can't afford to be). I think the Golden Valley peppered beef jerky strikes a good balance of quality and value. The product looks, smells, and tastes pretty much like beef with some black pepper added to it. No MSG, no artificial flavors. Hours after you've eaten it, you won't feel like something is polluting you. The package has only a small amount of crumbs and small fragments, so it's finger food all the way to the bottom of the bag, not fingers-in-your-mouth food.UPDATE: After a long period of subscribing to the Golden Valley Original 16-ounce packages, I've given up. The quality declined gradually, with pieces becoming smaller and tougher with not much flavor. But the final blow was a sudden decrease to a 12-ounce package -- at the same price. I'll have to find something else."
3,Way too sweet,"I'm glad this is processed without all the additives of other brands, but it is too sweet and not spicy enough for me. It may be okay for other folks, but I won't buy it again."
3,"High quality, but too sweet","High quality cuts of meat that can often require putting a little jerking into the eating of your jerky. Extremely sweet for ""original flavor""."
1,poor quality beef jerky,"The meat was poor quality. It was very chewy--not tender at all--and many pieces were gristly, so we'd wind up having to spit wads out since no matter how much you chewed, they'd never break up. The taste was okay, but a bit too sweet for our liking."
3,Dry,"My pack was very dry. The flavor was ok, pretty bland. Overall I would rate as a below average jerky. Wouldn't buy again."
2,Okay jerky,"I buy this jerky because it's all-natural. The taste is great but the quality of the meat is just okay. Half the pieces contain what seems like cartilage or tendons or some stringy thing I'd rather not eat and some pieces are ridiculously tough. For the price, it's not really worth it."
5,Don't hesitate to buy this one: you won't be sorry!!,"This book is a must have. It uses the dragon book (Compilers: principles, techniques and tools by Aho et.al) as a model but goes a great deal further in its use of examples when explaining the theory. Whenever I had a little trouble understanding the dragon book or wished that more examples were used I turned to Holub's book. The book is extremely well organized. If you want the theory its all there and if you want to just look at code its all there too: thousands of lines of it! After explaining everything you actually get to see how lex and yacc are built (from the ground up) and finally a C compiler. BUY IT NOW!!"
5,Warmrails Heatra Classic Towel Warmer,"I am very pleased with the quality of the product, especially with the price it was purchased for. The chrome plating is excellent and it works very well at providing a warm, dry towel at the beginning of each day. I initially used it as a floor standing unit in order to make use of an available outlet but then switched it to a wall mounted unit to save on space. Although the unit comes with brackets and hardware for mounting it to the wall, I made my own bottom support brackets out of oak in order to utilize the existing screw lugs on the bottom rail that were used for the floor standing feet. I then put one of the provided brackets at the top at the extreme end of the rail so as not to interfere with towel placement. My wife and I are very pleased with the unit and doubling up on the towels works even better."
1,Broke after 5 months,"This towel warmer worked fine for a little while, then suddenly stopped warming towels after 5 months of use. Needless to say, I would have expected a slightly longer life-span. Maybe a year or two? Buyer beware."
1,I'd give it a zero if I could!,"After reading all of the mostly positive reviews, I was sure this would be just the thing for us. We just got a hot tub, so we always have a couple of towels that need warming and (I thought) a cool way to dry the bathing suits a little sooner than just letting them drip dry or throwing them in the dryer. This thing is useless. Actually, I forgot and left the towels on overnight. Well, they weren't dry (and they weren't soaking wet to begin with either). So, I decided to give it another try. I put the dry towels on and left them (overnight) -- I am not exaggerating, they were NOT warm. This product is not hotel quality. Don't waste your money. They don't work. Seriously. Fortunately, Amazon has an awesome return policy."
3,beware of plastic parts!,This is the second towel warmer that I have used. The first one was also a warmrails product and it worked great for the first three months I had it but after that the plastic inserts that is used in between the metal pieces broke so I had to buy another one. I have had the Heatra model for a month and so far so good it works great to dry my towels and keeps them warm. Unfortunately there are two large plastic spacers in between the body and the curved legs and they appear to be flimsy. I am hoping that the unit will hold up this time around. I think that this Heatra warmer is greater for people who have a small budget and want the option to have a free standing model.
1,Great disappointment! Look further before you buy,"This product seemed, at purchase to be a good choice. It was well rated by others, and moderately priced. It was neither the least, nor most expensive, and was rated well above average. To my dismay, I find it very disappointing. It does not warm my towel more than a bare minimum over the ambient room temperature, and that warmth is confined to the inner surfaces of the towel, which were in direct contact with the rack itself. Although all joints are fitted snug and fasteners tight, the rack itself is NOT a ""rock-solid"" unit, although for now it does not appear it will topple. I recommend anyone thinking about this, or any other similar device should ""test-drive"" one, or seek a quality unit with which they have experience at a hotel or resort PRIOR to committing funds!"
4,Great for the price,"Bought this to use while our fancy Runtal towel warmer is being repaired. This unit is highly function particularly if, as others suggest, you cover it with towels rather than trying to hang them on neatly and keep the unit on all the time. Easily worth the very reasonable price."
3,Toasty?,"While I love the concept of this product it was a bit disappointing to know that it doesn't warm the towels in a quick amount of time. It takes a while, like you have to leave it on all the time. Other than the amount of time it takes, we are happy with the product."
1,Does not wrm much...,"The rack itself gets pretty hot, but essentially none of the heat is transferred to the towel...we used this for 2 days and then put it in the basement where we now hang our laundry on it."
3,It could be warmer...,"Don't expect a fully toasty towel from this warmer. Better off buying the more expensive version if you want your towels to feel like it just came out of the dryer. However, with a reasonable price, it does its job good. Wish it could be a bit warmer all around and you would have to leave it on all day & night."
4,Nice !,"works very well. Towels are dry and don't get musty between uses. While it consumes about a light bulb worth of energy through heat, it saves water and washer/dryer cycles. Have it free standing and is stable. I will attempt to wall mount in the near future"
4,Good functionality - long life,"We received a Heatra Classic Warmrail as a wedding gift over 6 years ago and installed it right away. The unit never gave me any problems (except for breaking a wall mount clamp - but customer service sells those parts directly from their warehouse - they were great to work with), until this year; the heater unit gave out after being on (per their instructions) non stop for over 6 years! We just replaced it and the model is very much the same. We used the wall mount option over the floor stand, and were happy to find that the old wall clamps still worked for the new unit. This unit warms towels great in Colorado where we have little humidity and lots of cold air. My wife and baby use it every night."
2,Not for drying towels,"I returned this item after the first day I tried it. I needed something to dry the bath towels. First of all there is not space enough to dry 2 bath towels. Second, after a whole night the towels were not dried or I better say they were dried only on the parts that the railing touched the towels. Even it was a cheap product it doesn't do the job so I returned it. Do not buy it if you want dry towels."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased 4 of these. One for me and 3 others for Christmas presents. Once they arrived my husband hung ours on the wall and we started it up. The towel didnt warm at all. Now all 4 are going back.
4,Great warming rack for the money,"Rack works well, heating towels to just the right temperature. No more soggy towels! I also like that it's wall-mountable or freestanding. I have it freestanding so I can move it right by the shower door when I take a shower! Worth it just for drying towels quickly and not having to deal with mildewy, damp towels, especially in winter. Other models look a bit nicer but this one's a good buy."
4,Warmrails,Great new product! I traveled to England several years ago and fell in love with the towel warmer in the Bed and Breakfast I stayed in. When I saw this product at Amazon.com I just had to have one. Keep in mind they are not meant to transfer massive heat to the towel. If you waive the towel in and out of the coils you should get a nice warm even temperature on the towel. Nothing is better on a cold winter morning. Enjoy
3,Warmrails Heatra Classic Freestanding Towel Warmer and Drying Rack...,"It does not warm near what early models do. I am not sure what I will do with it, maybe a secondary bathroom would suffice."
3,Meh....not overly impressed,"It doesnt get very warm, so it does not really warm up the towel all the way through. It's not great for clothes either. It is just a little to weak.I would not recommend if you really want warm clothes to jump into, in the morning."
2,Towel Warmer,"I like the design of the product as it does allow for putting the towels on the warmer easily; however, the design does not allow for a good heat distribution. The towels do not get warm. Assembly was easy and delivery timing was fine. I would not purchase a product from this manufacturer again."
2,Did not deliver as expected.,"This did not warm the complete towel as I expected. The bars got warm and the towel did, also, where it contacted the bars, but not the rest of the towel. I ordered 2 of them and they both operated the same way, so I do not think they were defective. Everyone was very congenial to deal with over this issue, but I was VERY disappointed with it. I am trying a different brand to see if they do better."
4,Warm towels,"Warm towels are always a luxury. The warmer dries the towels efficiently between uses and makes them more absorbent but doesn't warm them to the degree I was hoping. Accidently touching the metal parts does not burn a person, which is good. Great value for the money."
3,TOO HOT!,"I read the other reviews and couldn't believe it! I have two of these because the first one was so hot it was charring the towels. The second one is only slightly cooler. I put our outdoor thermometer on it and it came out at 203 degrees! (I put two towels then the thermometer then two more towels). It's been unplugged now that we know that. They must have poor thermometers if some are cold and some are hot! My friend has an oil one, but they don't seem to make that anymore. I'll miss my hot, hot towels, but I need something now that I'm hooked."
3,Enjoying the warmer,Bought this warmer as a replacement for the exact same one I recvd as a gift 2 years ago. This one doesn't seem to warm the towels as well as the 1st one did. It works great in the summer the kids can put wet swim suits on top of the towels and they both dry fairly quickly. It is great hanging can put two towels on it to dry.
1,Do not buy this towel warmer!!!,"Caveat emptor, gentle reader! This towel warmer is a disaster of a product, at the low end of the scale even by Chinese manufacturing standards. The packaging was subpar. The directions for assembly are nearly indecipherable. The screws do not even fit the holes! There was a piece rattling around inside the warmer. Who knows what else is wrong with this thing?There's a reason they have a towel hanging over the product in the picture: it's to conceal the towel warmer underneath! That they are asking upwards of $80.00 for this product is deplorable."
2,Waiting for a replacement,"I'm hoping that the replacement will be better.The screws that came with the unit were too long and it was extremely difficult to attach the legs. I have had the unit for approx one month and now the legs are loose and wobble. I called this morning for a replacement.The unit dries our towels sufficiently, so I'm hoping the new one will be better."
1,Not So Warm Rails,"I was very disappointed with the Warm Rails. The only thing that was warm was the 1 inch space of the towel on the top of the rail. I left it warming overnight, no improvement. I would not recomend this product to anyone who desires warm towels."
4,Better than not having one...,"It dries towels quickly, and makes them toasty warm. I've used two giant bathsheets from Pottery Barn, which are thick, extremely large towels, folded over several times, and they only become warm in certain places, but they dry much faster than they normally would on their own. When it's two regular or large bath towels, it works even better.The warm rails become a bit hot, so you need to be careful, especially if you have pets that can get close to it. It also warms up the bathroom (being in the North East, that's a plus to me!). Definitely better than not having it. They do require a bit of floor space. We have two - one in the City and one in weekend house in the mountains; it's a lifesaver up there."
1,Towel Warmer doesn't really warm. . .,"I bought this towel warmer as a gift for my husband and was horribly disappointed with it as was he. The bar got very warm while the towel stayed nice and cool. We even tried the suggestions of putting several towels on it at a time, this too failed. This product may be okay if you're looking for a drying rack but don't be fooled in to thinking that it will warm your towels."
3,Not bad for $50.,"I read the rather variable reviews on the towel rail, and was initially hesitant, but decided to go for it and see how well the towel rail worked for myself.It does its job reasonably well - the rail gets surprisingly very warm/hot (although not uncomfortably so to the touch). Where it contacts the towel, yes the towel is warm. Where there is no contact, a thick towel really doesn't warm up much. The best idea is to bunch up the towel around one or two of the rails.I've put mine on the wall, and it's very stable with heavy towels loaded on it.Essentially, if you want your entire towel to be cosy warm for after the shower, then this won't work for you - you need an airing cupboard with a water boiler/tank inside. If you want the towels to be a few degrees higher than room temperature, or dry some clothes quickly, then this probably will work for you."
3,Dries the towels,Like other reviews have stated. This towel warmer does not produce the hot towels you might want. I bought it knowing that. This does a great job drying the towels that keeps them fresher and helps reduce the dampness in the bathroom
4,Warm towels anyone?,Found that the rack does just what the info said it would do.We have had no problems- we turn it on and off when we plan to use it.
3,Warmrails,"The item is ok. This was a gift for my partner who does massage. I thought it would be nice for my partner to hand clients a nice warm towel when done to get off any excess oil. According to my partner, the towel rack works ok. The towels are warm only around the areas that are directly on the rack. The preference would have been for the towels to be warmer (hot even). However, with it being summer, I wonder if you would feel the difference more in the winter time."
3,Does the job,Good for small/ regular-sized towels. I find that it's best to hang two towels at most (hang them from the first two rungs only). I don't like folding the towels because the inner part doesn't get warm. I suggest just putting them over the rack for maximum drying.
1,I returned this item,"This rack barely got the first layer of a towel warm, even after being plugged in for days. I don't like having to keep it on all the time. I bought this because of good reviews and it was priced HUNDREDS less than other towel racks. The manual says you can use it to dry items also---I don't see how. I guess you do get what you pay for. In this instance, as another reviewer said, an expensive towel rack."
2,"Not much ""warming""","We were excited to add this to our new bathroom but, sadly, it doesn't really warm our towels very much. We followed all directions and even left the towels on the rack for hours - but only part of the towel every got lukewarm..."
4,Nice towel warmer,I lived in the UK for 33 years and always used one of these so I got used to them. I found one here in the USA about 8 years ago and this is my second one - the first one died (different brand). It is so nice to have warm towels in the morning but the best thing is that you never have damp towels lying around. This one works very well.
1,heated towel rack and dryer,"Since I do not have a window in my bathroom, I thought a heated towel rack would dry my towels as well as heat them for showering. Unless the unit I purchased was defective, it did not do the job. I was really disappointed. I followed the instructions to let it heat up for 24 hours but still only luke warm. It was the perfect size and color but that's all I can say about it. On the other hand, returns to Amazon are amazing. No fuss, no effort, no problems. Will always deal with Amazon. Thanks for the great service, Amazon."
1,Don't Bother,I'm sorry to have to say that this product just doesn't work as a towel warmer. I was worried because of the low price and I was right to worry.
3,Amazon Sucks & Doesn't Price Match,"I bought a Warm Rails & within 2 weeks it was listed $3.50 cheaper by Amazon. I requested a credit for this & Amazon Refused. Amazon has lost customers by their refusal. Were these losses worht the 3.50? I wouldn't think so, but apparently they did. There are plenty of others who would gladly take business. Your Loss Amazon. You Suck!"
2,Not for the uninitated,If you're trying to find the origin of various religious practices and differences this is not the book. Green assumes that reader knows what various terms are and often I did not (and I'm studying to be a Baptist Preacher). Why does the Catholic Bible have extra books from the protestant? Couldn't find it in here. How did the Baptists rise to dominance in the U.S.? Who knows? It's not here. The text is dry and unenlightening. I believe there are many better books for the uninitiated and even the fairly well initiated.
3,Very Good player; absolutely appalling software,"The sound quality is excellent, the player works beautifully and it's easy to use. BUT getting your music onto the memory card is painful. You can ONLY do it with RealOne's software - you can't drag and drop an mp3 file to the card. The RealOne software is buggy, slow and takes over your PC. It took a good deal of time to reset my PC back to how it should work with the music file associations as I like it and adverts removed.Using RealOne is a pain. It frequently fails to transfer the music, giving unhelpful error messages so you have to keep clicking the ""transfer"" button until eventually it succeeds in transferring the music over. And when you get a new memory card, formatting it takes forever because RealOne keeps failing. You have to click ""format"" over and over until eventually it works.At first, I thought it was a problem with my PC but if you check out the online forums, you'll find the problems I mention are common."
4,Pretty Good Product!!,"I received this as a Christmas gift and had doubts about its claims. I did have problems with the installation of RealOne. It seemed to have seriously slowed down my system initially but 8 hrs later I had it working like a charm. It automatically converts your CD WAV files into AAC format but I especially like the WMA format at 128kbps. Sound quality is great! It looks great and above all is easy to use. The only downside is the neon transcolored looking neck strap. I'm a bit embarrassed to wear this thing to the gym. So I'll have to buy an aftermarket arm strapped case. It comes with 64MB SD media. The larger sized disks are pricing so I'll wait until the price drops. Overall, it is definitely a good value I recommend it."
5,Highly recommed!,"My husband bought me the Panasonic SV-SD50 awhile ago. I love it! First of all, it is extremely small so I can easily put it in my pocket when I work out. Sound quality is excellent and the headphones that come with it are really good. Most headphones that come with products are not worth anything, but these are pretty good. Do not know anything about customer service on this product - have not had to use it. I have had no problems with it at all. The Panasonic SV-SD50 is a good mp3 player in my opinion."
1,not alot of storage!,This item is not worth over $100. there is only 64 mbs on it that fits like 10 songs on there I advise you not to buy
3,Some of you are younger than this dictionary,"Buried on the copyright page is the most fascinating fact in this book: that a major publishing house has the gall to keep the words ""entirely new"" on the dust-jacket of a dictionary it hasn't revised in twenty-seven years.It's so old that the entry for the word ""microwave"" doesn't mention ovens. This is a fine dictionary as far as it goes. Unfortunately, as far as it goes is the Carter administration.If you're a professional translator who needs a shelf full of lexicons, it's a useful volume. But if you're only going to get one French-English / English-French dictionary, this emphatically should *not* be it."
2,There are better ones out there,"This book is a good dictionary to get an idea of meanings of words, but doesn't give clear definitions, and needs to be revised severely. Until they come out with a new edition or re-do this one, I would NOT recommend it."
1,Dictionnaire viter,"Ce dictionnaire est de mauvaise qualité. Trop souvent, les definitions sont obsoletes, le vocabulaire caduc. Le livre semble tout droit sorti du XIXeme siecle, sans aucune réactualisation pendant le XXeme (la rentabilité du produit doit tre exemplaire, un case study pour les business schools). Exemple de traduction: all the world over = par toute la terre...A eviter absolument"
5,Very detailed and inspiring,"There seem to be so many books on the techniques of the old Masters, but it's very difficult to find books on actual painting techniques of the Impressionists. This book discusses this topic in extreme detail. Small sections of paintings are magnified with arrows pointing to specific areas, describing how they were probably done and with which paint colors.As a context to the primary subject matter, you also get a fair amount of art history. This part I found interesting as well.I read this book for hours at a time and was thoroughly fascinated and inspired. If you love the Impressionists and (especially) if you are a painter yourself, you will really appreciate this book."
4,Very Helpful,"I have read the reviews of Mason Dixon and ""A Customer"" (both from 2004) and I agree with them. What they wrote is basically what I think (and I won't repeat here what they have said). I do add the following explanation of why I rate the book at ""only"" 4 stars--which of course is a high recommendation.While the book is very helpful and well done, its reproduction of paintings is rather mediocre (not horrible, not great). Nevertheless, it IS sufficient to illustrate points made in the text and to give a decent idea of the paintings' beauty. Overall, a very nice book."
3,Unoriginal Fun,"The title of my review says it all. MBR are a good band, even great, when you don't think about the fact that 235345 other bands have already put out basically this same record. Does that mean its bad? Not at all. Unlike other clone bands like Story of the Year (horrible), MBR manages to incorporate some clever lyrics. My only complaint is that this album is a little over-produced. (See new version of The Greatest Fall for the best example of that). My favorite songs are Your Stories, My Alibis, Playing for Keeps (best one on here), and Tiger Lily which is a sweet acoustic number. Good, harmless fun."
2,nothing you probably havn't heard before,"matchbook romance is more of the same. sure, they're not a bad band, its just i have heard it before. its not that they suck. its just there are many other bands out there that are way better (the used, static lullaby). but hey if you're into pop punk with a little scream here and there, pick it up. whatever floats your boat."
2,Its just way too emo,"I really regret buying this cd...the songs are just really annoying and sound all the same. The majority of them arent even that catchy either.....it seems like they used the first ideas that came to their heads in most of the songs.A couple of songs are pretty good though: promise, the greatest fall(old version is better though), playing for keeps, etc.Even as a person who listens to music that is often considered emo (motion city soundtrack, fall out boy, panic! at the disco, the starting line, underoath) this cd is way too emo even for me.....now i am starting to see why so many people hate emo...its because of bands like matchbook romance."
5,Excellent.,"I rarely write reviews for CDs I listen to constantly. I usually go on this site to see if a CD is worth buying and to see what others are listening to these days. I picked this CD up after a friend of mine suggested it and thought they were AWESOME. They are a very talented band who only has more great things coming for them. The songs are very catchy and they are on my top 3 list now up there with Yellowcard and Story of the Year. There is not one bad song on the whole CD. I know it sounds like all the other reviews on here, but I wanted to do my little part in supporting the band. They sound like Yellowcard / TheUsed / Taking Back Sunday / All-American Rejects. A little bit of each band and with there own unique sound on top. Can't wait for them to drop another CD."
5,awesome,"this is by far the best cd ive bought in a long time. its one of those cds that you can listen to a thousand times over without getting bored. it goes from sweet, melodic emo to powerful rock, and its an incredible album. even my friends who cringe at the word 'emo' went crazy over this band. buy this cd, itll become one of your favorite bands."
1,just awful,"i saw these guys open for fall out boy (who are amazing) and these guys bored the life out of me quickly. i just don't understand how anybody can like this crap. this is totally cliched. i've heard it all before. i could compare this to the used, finch, story of the year, taking back sunday, etc... but that wouldn't really make a difference. as a matter of fact, all of you stupid kids would probably buy this record based solely on that. and what a shame that is, when in this world, you can get some friends together, pick up instruments and totally imitated note-for-note some of your favorite bands, and be LOVED for it?!?!?!?!""no talent or imagination required"" was probably this band's headline in a magazine or something when they were looking for a member. ha. it's really not that funny."
2,ehh,"this cd is very generic for it's genre. there isn't anything stand-out about this album. it has some catchy stuff that's rather meloncholy and delightful at times, but otherwise, unless you're heavy into the genre of teen-pop-punk-emo, don't bother. it isn't fair to say this album is bad, it's just not for me personally. i was looking for something more My Chemical Romance/A.F.I. intensity, and this album went in the other direction. this is more for the preppy high school ""pink-shirt punk rock princess with spazzle dazzle"" which isn't to say it's a bad thing, but it's not for me. overall, this album is ok, i guess. it has some ""pretty"" sounds, his vocals are generic, the lyrics are pretty cool. everything else is...generic. buy Senses Fail..."
4,Great CD,"this cd is def worth looking into. i wouldnt go by the clips they give u on this site cuz its a tad missleading but its still a great cd. it has a little bit of everything (rock-ish, punk-ish, some screaming but not a lot maybe like screaming a word) but this cd has somthing to it that stands out from the rest. the best songs on it are ""stories and alibi's"" (prob didnt spell it right"" and ""Shadows like statues"" those songs pump me up and they are verry ketchy. i find my self humming those songs at work. so ya def buy this cd"
4,Still a good Buy,When i firsted listened to it i put it away and didn't both with putting it on again untill i ripped it to a mp3 cd for the car and now that it has grown on me it has become one regular tunes for my ears. looiking at there other cd's it's still not the best but if you do like some of there Songs then it's still a good buy.
3,"Some decent songs, but overall average","First, this is the worst CD production I've ever listened to. There are roughly 70 blank 4 second long tracks to ""hide"" the last track. This makes the original CD annoying to play in any real CD player. I had to burn a copy without the blank tracks just to not annoy myself.#1 seems just like filler.#2 is the best by far, you can listen to that from amazon, so I won't say more.There are a few good tracks, the rest are certainly nothing too special.#4, #5, #7 are on the top. The lyrics are pretty decent and are in line with typical emo.Most of the other songs, in my view are just a little annoying.The 'hidden' track is more filler."
2,So-So CD....Terrible Band,"As a well-educated rock music,especially emo-punk,person,I was sickened every time i tried to listen to this CD all the way through.Why? It's definitely one of the less-than-great emo albums ever (not completely horrible,though)and the fact that this band is led by a singer who shouldn't be bragging about his ""musical genius"" when he should first realize how disgusting his voice sounds compared to most other emo singers,isn't sweetening the deal.When i bought this album,it had a sticker on it that read:""If you like Taking Back Sunday,Brand New and The Used,you'll love Matchbook Romance!""I should have known how desperate they were when i read that.But more disturbing is the fact that they dared compared themselves to Taking Back Sunday? TBS is actually an emo band that doesn't sound recicled.And Brand New?Have they heard Deja Entendu?That album is not only the best emo album,but definitely one of the best albums of all time-in any genre."
1,Emo? Ooooooooh crap................................,"Damn. I've just realised how emo this CD is. Next time I buy a CD, I'm gona make sure I don't just listen to the first couple of samples. Not being an emo fan, I realy hated this CD. The only track that was sort of ok-ish was ""Playing for keeps"" My advice that no-one here will want? Go get some good old ska-punk like Losing streak by Less Than Jake.Boy is this review gona get ""0 people out of 20 found this helpful""."
