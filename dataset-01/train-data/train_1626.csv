5,the best book out there for race car design topics,"I am a mechanical engineer. I am very into my hobby of race cars. I have a stack of books on chassis, suspnsion and overall race car design. This book is by far the best and most comprehensive of them all. I have benefited more from this book than any of the others. I will def be purchasing the work book to go along with this."
2,Title is really misleading,"It has a great title and hardcover, but this is hardly an engineering book on vehicle dynamics. Maybe it classifies as a good reading book with interesting stories and some basic explanations, but not what you expect from serious mechanical and aerodynamic engineering (I'm sorry, but having basic equations doesn't make it an engineering book!). It might be a good fit for the technical race-car enthusiast. This is dissapointing, perhaps they should let you have a peek inside the book to help you decide whether you want to buy it or not."
4,Race Engineers bible,"I think i've bought this book a bit too early in my learning curve!This is a book intended for the Professional Race Engineer, or an extremely motivated amateur.It contains a wealth of mathematics for vehicle dynamics.Very exciting, i expect to have years of fun with the various chapters in this book."
4,A good reference work,"A very informative book on the engineering fundementals, it would be good if a second edition with more mordern race vehicles was in the works."
3,a little too much philosophy for me,The exercises are performed by a master.They range from quite easy to very difficult. Between each demonstration is a Hindu story with pictures. I was looking for an exercise video so it wasn't that suitable. I find the philosophical/religious stuff distracting.
1,"Boring, bad camera work","I was very dissapointed in this video, very poor camera work, ugly background, too much talk. If one is going to exercise to a video every day it would help to have an attractive picture to look at. This features an ugly background, poor lighting and an unattractive man."
3,relatively disappointed!,The following is just a personal opinion and has nothing to do with a professionals point of view.The quality of the underwater part is not the best I have ever seen.(That is the technical part).Somehow I have missed the essence of Tai Chi the way is done originally. (the moments of stillness and the calmness while the exercises are performed. - Or Maybe I am just too European.....It plays good on my Mac but there is a difficulty to deal with a PC - microsoft software....
2,Disappointed,I'm sorry but I was really disappointed with the video. I didn't think the models looked comfortable or natural.
3,BLACC BALLED,"THE CD IS GOOD, BUT MY MAIN REASON FOR PURCHASING THIS ITEM WAS TRACK NUMBER 7 & 12. ALSO, I JUST LOVE THAT WEST COAST SOUND. YOU KNOW, THAT G FUNK."
1,Poor product,Got this for one of my video projectors. The cable was defective when I hooked it up. It only showed black and white. The other problem was I was getting a lot of interference from it(lines scrolling across the screen). Other than that...It looks good.
3,Get closer to Percy Grainger & Morton Feldman,"Charles Amirkhanian's ""Walking Tune"" is an extended spoken-word portrait of late American composer Morton Feldman incorporating his recorded speeches and conversations. It's also an homage to Australian-American composer Percy Grainger where haunting violin melodies and fragments of Bach are combines with out-of-doors sounds like geese honks and swarms of hummingbirds to convey Grainger's own praise of nature, using ""memory triggers"" to create the presence of a person. Stimulating."
2,casts a bad light on blended families,"My 5 year old adores Polly Pocket so of course this was a must have for us. I was pretty disgusted to watch and see that an evil stepmother to be plays a key role in the plot. Aren't blended families hard enough without reinforcing this stereotype in another movie? I'm not sure how the drama with Polly's dad getting remarried made the movie better and in fact really made my daughter question what would happen if her father got a ""new wife.""The rest of the movie is fun and has lots of shopping, sugary sweet pop music and all the other girly stuff...just be aware of the weird dark cloud hanging over the plot ~ we could have done without the drama and seeing my daughter worry about a stepmother was a little uncomfortable - too much for a 5 year old."
2,Not recommended for the younger crowd,"Although this movie is not bad, I think they missed with their target market. This movie would be appropriate for the 9+ market. It has been my observation that the biggest Polly fans are in the 4-7 age range.My daughter (almost 5) LOVES Polly Pockets, so this was a must have for her. After watching it with her today, I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing it.The plot of the movie centers around Polly's father's fiancee wanting to get Polly off to boarding school so the fiancee can have the dad all to herself. The second theme is the competition between the good Polly and the bad Beth.The subject is just above the comprehension of most young kids."
5,Pollyworld,Couldn't find this movie anywhere in the stores. Glad I have Amazon to help me. My daughter loves this one. Thanks.
5,PollyWorld - When is the next movie coming out?,"I've watched this several times with my daughter. The songs are cool, the dialogue is girl-friendly and it's all good, clean fun! There is another DVD called ""2 Cool at the Pocket Plaza"" that is also enjoyable. It was part of a toy set. 2 thumbs up to Mattel for a hip alternative to Barbie and the Bratz! When is the next movie coming out?"
2,Really dingy,This movie is suitable for children but only if you can handle airheadedness. Will drive parents nuts if watched too many times. Can only handle small doses.
1,The book of Perfumes,"I haven't bought the book, because by simply searching inside it I encounter the greatest deterrant.Going through the index and finding Chapter IX being titled ""Uncivilized Nations"" took any further interest away from me.An author who considers himself a knowledgable person should have a richer vocabulary to define diverse ethnias from New Zealand, South America and so forth.Condemnably shameful."
3,Nice atmosphere..,"Great transfer and superb quality on this sinister cinema dvd! This traditional but quite interesting, early sixties, horror movie is shot in gorgeous color and wonderful settings that creates a tense atmosphere, together with fine acting from the leads, aspecially Pierre Brice and Scilla Gabel. Highly recommended to fans of the genre!"
1,not a good bag,"After I use 3 week it carried 3 book for school everyday, it broke. It is easy break bag. zippy has smell."
3,"Well, it works.","I LOVED this bag. Until the zipper broke. I always see it in my weekender bag pile and go to it, and then remember the zipper broke. I wish it hadn't. I didn't over use it, and wear it out. I used it maybe 4 or 5 times before it crapped out on me. Its a shame. maybe I'll have it fixed one day. Upsetting cause I dont want to spend anymore money on it."
1,Terrible bag.,"Zipper does not work well. It arrived with a pink stain that runs across the entire zipper area. Very poor bag, would not recommend this to anyone."
2,poor quality,This bag looks nice in theory but the zipper doesn't move smoothly and the bag itself is pretty flimsy. I was looking for an overnight bag and this is turned out to be more inconvenient then it's worth... and it broke within a few months.
2,Disappointment*,"I bought this bag, and to my dismay, the pink color stains were present, the discoloration in the red also present.Not only did this suffice 1* weekend to spend $40 and have the zipper fall off hinge with one use is not practical. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. Another bag that is useless in the closet right now. May use the fabric for something later. Strongly urge you not to buy this product."
4,Great for crafts!,"This little book contains six precut designs of fish on sturdy paper. Each fish is made with a few parts, suitable for use in all kinds of crafts. I used these designs (along with the ""Sea Creatures"" book from the same series) to etch fish onto a bathroom mirror. (I traced them onto contact paper first and cut them out.) But there's only about a thousand other things you can do with them. I'm going to make a giant poster with all the sea creatures and fish stencils, next. These little books are indeed fun. This one contains an angelfish, a salmon, a goldfish, a flounder, a swordfish, and a shark."
5,Great book for historical facts,This book is about Lucretia Motts life. Much of the book is taken from her diary or historical documents. The book allowed the reader to experience her life of hardships and struggles to give women more rights. The book would be a good selection for upper elementary teachers to use as a read aloud.
2,too much talk,"i dont like how its full of so much written information, most of which is opinion and somewhat offensive. seems like he wants you to read more than play"
2,a chance to see the other point of view about Newman,"as near as I can tell, Newman has lots of theory but has never given real proof of output power (with no input power) for the last 30 years. Many people have lost big money on this."
2,Being Perfect and a short guide to a happy life.,This audio CD would make a great gift for a graduating student. Buy too elementary for one who as live a long life. Author didn't have anything new to add to my life.Would recommend for a graduate and maybe they will take some of her good advise.
1,Beautiful sounds until the 4th number. The rest is a mess .,With many of my recent orders (which I have had to return) the reproduction is tragic! The quality control is NON EXISTANT.. How disappointing to await one of the great bands and even be able to enjoy it !
4,Better than the first in this series,"I was more pleased with this than the first in the Life's Story series. (You may see my review posted for number 1 in the series.)Life's Story: The One That Hasn't Been ToldIt was not slow like the first one and the information and footage was much more interesting. I don't think both need to be viewed so if you have a choice, go for this one."
3,The History of Penn State review.,I was expecting to know more of the coach Joe Paterno and the team.The video review the history of one of the most successful program on the history of the college footall. I recommend the purchase of this product to any fan on football.
2,The Future Sound of Boring,"I bought this because of a good Tosca song (Ocean Beat) that I'd heard on-line. I expected more of the same, but in 2 CDs there are only about 4 good songs and a few more that are ok. For the most part this is atmospheric fluff, which will put you to sleep -- and it will be a sleep with boring, depressing dreams. And for the record, nothing on this record has the remotest connection to the future of jazz."
5,A beautiful ring,"The dolphin is one of my favorite animals and the amethyst is my favorite gemstone, so I love this ring. I got it in a size 5.5, which fits my right second finger. It's a perfect size for my tiny hands. It's slender, unobtrusive, and very very shiny. The gemstone always sparkles."
5,Beautiful Ring!,This ring is so beautiful..It looks great on your finger...I want to get it in different stones..Fun to wear..you will find your self sharing at it alot!! Do buy this ring!! You won't regret it....
5,Nice product.,"I was debating purchasing a more expensive item, but it seems I am more captivated by the more reasonably priced jewelry.This product is very nice, and the delivery and service was excellent. Do recommend for animal lovers."
4,Great colors wet or dry,"Estee Lauder is my favorite make-up brand, so I usually try to get every new product they have. This eyeshadow I got for Christmas and it was a very good present (considering it was from a guy), the color was seashell which I loved. Later I went to Estee Lauder to get some more colors and I was surprised to see how many different colors they offered. The eyeshadow stays on for a very long time, and it doesn't matter how you apply it, wet or dry, it still looks good. You can even use it as an eyeliner. It's so great!"
3,The city affected by the world of assassins,"The title and the synopsis had me interested in reading this story because of CJ Cherryh's assassins guild and my sons' fascination with ""Assassins Creed"". But a world of assassins would probably not make an interesting story. What I got instead was a slum on a backwater world that had an assassin problem.The detective story was nicely done. And the ""humans as immigrant laborers"" theme worked well.Not what I expected but a good read over all."
5,Excellent Meditation or Relaxation music,"This Cd is very, very good.... It is meditative, yet not airy-fairy. Otherwords it has guts... I try not to play it too ofter to maintain the great effect this CD has... Very otherworldly to say the very least......You can't go wrong on this CD."
5,very good album,"This is Cock Sparrer's last album, and it is pretty damn good. It has not only punk, but also a straight-foward rock-n-roll song(Bats out), and has a song with some Spanish favor in it(I live in Marbella). There are some slower ones here as well as anthems such as ""Before the flame dies."" Cock Sparrer definately went out with a bang with this one."
5,A Masterpiece of Mystery,"The music of Myst III perfectly captures the mysterious essence of the game. Some pieces are a slowly flowing vision of dark beauty while others are metallic and ominous. Jack Wall, the composer, masterfully mixes Arab, African, Chinese, and Western themes and then adds the final cavernous echo with synthesizers and other sound effects in the background. The result is an impressive collection of atmospheres that gives life to the meticulously crafted worlds of Myst. Jack Wall's score is complex and intriguing. Its use of multiple instruments and styles makes it difficult to classify into any one genre. The music simply is Myst; haunting, serene, silken, and lonely."
1,I would rather die then watch this movie...,This movie is so bad! I couldn't even watch it! If there is one thing you should do before you die it is not to watch this movie! This movie is a disgrace to the Ator series.
4,Poor sound quality,"I own every CD Blondie ever made, and the sound quality on this is noticably BAD. Buy the two-volume collection which came out a couple of years ago. There is certainly nothing wrong with the selections on this -- other than sound quality -- but Blondie had WAY more great material than appears here. Actually, ""Parallel Lines"" is a better album than this."
4,almost all songs enjoyable,"Many good songs and then a couple that make you wonder - best of, but then again their catalog was not too extensive on hits and more fun songs."
3,Avoid,"This CD has been replaced by ""Greatest Hits"" which contains all the songs on ""Best of Blondie"" plus more, all in much better sound quality."
4,"""One Way Or Another"", get some Blondie.","This is actually a near-perfect ""vinyl era"" collection. It's 12 of their best, and all the obvious choices are here. Included is ""Heart Of Glass"", ""The Tide Is High"", ""Call Me"", and ""Rapture"", among many others. However I find I enjoy the lesser hits even more. Tracks like ""Dreaming"", ""Hanging On The Telephone"", ""Sunday Girl"", and ""Atomic"" are all great songs. The one thing about ""Blondie"", is that whether they were doing punk, disco, new wave, or almost rap, they excelled at it, and at the time, ""Debbie Harry"" was HOT! Truth be known though, I'd actually get the ""Greatest Hits"" over this. It's remastered, and has 7 more tracks, including ""Maria""."
3,There are much better Blondie overviews out there,"When it came out this album was the only overview of Blondie availible and worth it. However, with the release of Blonde and Beyond and the Platinum Collection must better sets are out there. Best of concentrates too heavily on their dance hits and ignores a lot of quality tunes from their early albums and their B-sides. Also, their last album (until February, yeah) came out after Best of. Blonde and Beyond, with the classic B-side Susie and Jeffrey (read Debbie's book to get the whole story on this one) and some great unreleased items, like the earlier, slower version of Heart Of Glass, is a much better buy."
4,Very Old Bill,"This is a detailed look at the life of a fictional but realistic policemen in Victorian London. Written with restrained humour, the book leads the reader through a typical day. Period illustrations show us the places, people and things of a policeman's lot.There is a plot to this book and the reader is drawn along as Police Constable Arnold Pipkin pulls together a few loose ends to solve a small mystery involving an escaped villian and a fire in a clothing factory.The second half of the book provides a non-fiction overview of law, crime and punishment in Victorian times. There is a short index and bibliography. Excellent material for anybody wanting to research the atmosphere of the period."
2,"If you're reading this, know what you're in for.","If you must, I suggest finding and watching individual episodes of this series online. The only ones which I found reasonably acceptable was episode #10, ""Binding"". #2 ""Sacred Girl"" has a fairly good story and character design if you can stomach the incestuous themes. Not to mention the infamous #7 ""Yellow Star"" sequence, an early work of Yasuomi Umetsu, who later went on to direct two fairly good anime OAVs in Kite and Mezzo Forte.Would not recommend watching the rest unless you're an extreme S&M; fan. Hardcore content all the way through, be warned."
1,Do NOT waste your money,"These videos are just mean and the animation is very cheap and jumpy ... do NOT waste your money. 4 DVDs are only 4 times the ""mean""."
3,thought he wanted it,"one of those ""gotta have"" toy's that didn't pan out-wore the battery out getting that thing air-borne-if it had worked it would have been great, but------"
1,NO ENOUGH TIME,"please this battery doesn't work at all, less than 5 minutes and let me tell you if the battery gets discharged in the middle of a lake you will need a real boat to get your storm launcher back, i wouldn't mind to pay a few plus dollars just to have more time to enjoy my storm launcher."
5,Nice!,I got this as a replacement for my grandson's air hog and luckily it powers up 2 more air hogs that he has now. I was happy to find it on Amazon. Thanks Amazon!
5,Exactly what I needed!,"This charger is exactly what I needed and it works fantastic. I have been looking for one of these for awhile because they do not make them anymore, so glad I found it!"
1,Don't be fooled: this ain't Jewish,"Don't be fooled: this ain't JewishThis guy has got some talent, no doubt...but don't be fooled. Jewish wrapping paper, Christian guts.Jews, stay away."
4,Good... but then not..,"This program is very good for what it does. It has to be one of the better Microsoft products. But considering the FREE or cheaper products available for the same use. It seems like its not worth it. And really its not, but if you buy it in the suite of products (Office XP Pro) its more worth the money. And you'll find that its a common requirement in Schools and knowledge that is more and more being required.In this case i was lucky and got it at a KILLER discount (Free from a friend who couldnt use it) but it is a good solid program."
3,Photo Displayed is not what you receive.,What's shown in the picture is actually the 60 gram bottle. So just be sure to imagine 1/10 of what you see for what you will actually be receiving.
5,timeless and brilliant,"As we move into the 21st Century it is essential to remember what our true responsibilities, as educators are. This book gets right down to it."
1,Unfortunately written by John Weal,"The subject is cool, but like other books written by John Weal is very boring."
3,"Danger, Danger","Leona has put together some amazing songs for this album, such as the first 3 tracks, ""home"", ""yes, it's called desire"", or ""one kind of love"". Yet, her first two cds had more of a particulary style to them: they mixed folk with electronic arragements, killer pop tunes with Fiona Apple-esque dramatizations.This time around everything is more simple and slowed down. Like I said, some fab songs come out of it (this shows that Leona is indeed a powerful artist), but personality is lost and can be easily confused for an Aimee Mann type of record.The mellow way suits her well; the folk one as well; but maybe for an artist of her measure a little bit more risk (like mixing this with trip hop beats, or jazzy like tunes) would have improved Leona Naess a great deal. As for the record title..."
1,some people shouldnt get record contracts,"this cd is pretty awful,you wonder why leona even got the chance to record a cd, one of the worst songs ever is Calling,, it sounds like taunting from elementary school kids on the playground, na na na na , na na na na, i agree with the reviewer who said she is a very weak edie brickell sounding singer........."
3,The best of the three.,I thought this was the best of the three in the series. I especially liked how he told the story from several points of view.
2,"For RR fans, pass this up.","I've read a majority of Rudy Ruckers fiction, and this is without a doubt the most disappointing. Most of his work has a cerebral taste, but this work comes off as a cerebral distaste. This book is for those who have read Wetware & Software and must continue - otherwise pass it up."
2,"nice story, sci-fi this is not","Science fiction needs the integral component of science. Rucker's universe leaves a bad taste in my mouth of breaking most of the laws of physics, without much more than babbly pseudo-future-science jargon, hand waving.It's a nice enough story but file under fantasy. Two notches below masters like Sterling, Di Filipo, Stephenson.Oh did I mention most of the book is in annoying future-surfer speak, and obsessed with sex?Like not quite gnarly enough dude...."
4,Comparisons? Try Heinlein X Egan.,"Comparisons never quite seem to work. The closest I can get, however, is Heinlein's ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" and Greg Egan's ""Quarantine"". Why? Well, the book <feels> like a prepubescent Heinleinesque make-love-not-war-on-the-moon jaunt, but has a <mind> reminiscent of Greg Egan's heavy physics sci-fi. It seems like a neat synthesis of the two, in fact. On the other hand, it's just a damn good read."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Evolution continues rapidly in Rudy Rucker's freeware. From bops, big bops, little bops through meatbops we have yet another life form appearing in freeware, and it is sentient mold.These moldies, being more organic, can interact with humans differently, and in some cases very closely.More of the burned out beach bum and borg style can be found here."
2,Not Rudy's finest hour,"With all the predictions and future strangeness this comes off as Sodom andGomorrah: the characters are mostly seriously morally challenged ( bright like Molly).It comes off with the feeling that it was written by a person on pot having a dream that turns rapidly into a nightmare.The ideas of usingaperiodic tiles as computers has so far not had anything but virtual fruit like this.Written before the current quantum computing doctrines came inand AI went out of fashion, this novel has a genealogy of humans and moldiesand some sexual content that might be too much for a lot of people.The two other novels I've read by Rudy Rucker were much better than this one."
3,freeware review,"In this novel Rudy Rucker creates an original, twisted world where moldies (artificial life forms) and humans live amongst each other. Rudy creates a surfer/stoner dialect that could quite plausibly be a future lingo, like our generic, hip, MTV influenced lingo. Although I love Rudy's world and writing style I must admit this book was somewhat of a letdown. It was very captivating at times but those times were often followed by idle narrative. Plus the novel jumped around. It's like when you're watching a captivating sitcom, and right at the climax ""to be continued"" appears; tune in next week. The plot would then start a new chapter with a new character's story. Rudy would be careful to work in each character into the overall theme of the book though. I think if Rudy cut out all the idle, boring parts (that would be about half of the book) it would be a good novel. Some of Rudy Rucker's other books got better reviews so I would recommend you read those books."
1,"Smells ok,but it's not CUBA...","These are labeled as being from Champs,but it clearly states on the package:""Made in USA,Sasoon & Amanda Dow Inc."".It's false advertising on the part of the seller.Again,it's not at all affiliated with the CUBA you're probably looking for,which is made in France by Parfums des Champs.Cuba Variety By Cuba For Men.

4,Definately worth reading.,One of the more interesting books dealing with Mcveigh. Gives a feel for what type of person Mcveigh really was while taking a look at the inner workings of federal death row. I only wish it had a better publisher because it was filled with spelling errors and bad editing which slightly butchered the work of these two authors. And the price is a little steep. But the information is worth the price... Another piece of the puzzle.
4,Parts of the puzzle,To those who have studied the story of the Oklahoma City bombing this book answers at least a couple of key questions.
1,Not worth it.,"The authors use the majority of the book to tell their own stories and are using McVeigh, along with the victims of the OKC Bombing to make a name for themselves. They say that 95% of the book has been verified, and as a Historian working on this subject I can put that rumor to rest right now. They sensationalize McVeigh and try to make him appear humane; when the truth of the matter is bombed a federal building killing 168 people, including 19 children, and injured more than 500. Humane?? I believe not, especially considering if you have read his AUTHORIZED bibliography American Terrorist by Lou Michel and Dan Herbeck which gives a much more accurate portrayal of who this monster really was."
2,mine didnt stink,the stink bombs I got didnt stink at all..abut it is what it is. some work some dont.. Have had them in the past and they were good.
3,Meh...,"The smell is not very potent, i broke one outside my house and i couldn't even smell it :-/ i did one inside my house and i could smell it for a couple minutes, still not very strong though.I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Stink Bombs,I got this with a fart machine so it would stink when in used it but i guess ishould have just gotten the fart spray because these things have a horrible make you gag smell like rotten garbege but they are in really thick glass bottles so its kinda dangerous and hard to open. I do think they smell really bad though but it evaporates after about 10 mins. I threw one in someones car from beside them and it hit the front windshield and shattered in stinky-ness.8/10 Hard to open and broken glass on your fingers afterwards -1*.Evaporates after 10 mins -1*Other then that they served they're purpose i bought them for.
1,No stink,These stink bombs have absolutely no smell what so ever. Do not buy this product! It is a pure waste of your money from your pocket.
1,GARBAGE!!!!,"Yes it is cheap but I was expecting a stink! I broke these ""stink"" bombs at work and, NO SMELL WHATSOEVER! Don't even waste your money or time on this product! Total BULLS***!"
2,i have no idea,how to use this thing. they come i little glass bottles with no dierections. i could not figure out how to use this at all.i think maybe you throw them on the ground
4,Great escape tool,"This thing is amazing!!! I brought these to school when i had a major test that i didnt study for and let me tell you, we had to evacuate the class room! And my teacher looked like she was about to throw up!!! So if your looking for a good school prank this is your item! :D"
3,"Its kinda dumb lol, but yehh it works,","i was expecting some stupid crappy product, but these are fine, kind of dumb tho. but cheap, and worth it. no complaints."
1,IT Sucks,I got this thinking I was about to make some ones day miserable all it did was make me want my money back this product does not stink it should be called the odor less bombs...
5,Great medical information as well as personally encouraging,"Excellent writing, lists, charts & more help this book remain not only interesting but also easy to read & informative from the first chapter to the last. Sheehan helps those who suffer from all forms of anxiety & panic disorders as well as those who live with them, to understand the biological basis of their disease & to find ways to obtain relief. Far from a stale medical book, The Anxiety Disease not only contains excellent background information but also symptom lists, information about medications & their side affects, suggestions about treatment & encouragement for each step of the process. First recommended to me by a Psychiatrist friend, I now recommend it myself & use this book in on-line workshop groups for those with anxiety & phobias under the auspices of the The Life Challenges Empowerment Action Project (LEAP)"
5,THE ANXIETY DISEASE,"I am the person around whom this book was written. ( I suspect a few others got some air time)--- I will never forget the words Dr Sheehan spoke to me early into our first interview: ""It's chemical. And there is a drug."" And in short order I went from a person whose life was dictated by panic attacks of skull-cracking intensity, to a jolly and productive phobia free optimist. Really, just like that. And I am thankful that the patent on Xanax expired. So, from a life of panic starting in early infancy to an age where, if I told you, I would have to kill us both, anxiety free, I am NOT GOING BACK THERE TO DRUGLESS ANXIETY! All HAIL DR. DAVID SHEEHAN! Darn, I wished he had used my real name! I said, ""I want to be famous like Freud's Dora"" and he said, ""do you think DORA was HER real name?"""
1,Does not work with Canon SD 600,"It was listed on the Amazon site as working for the Canon SD 600. I bought it when I bought the camera. It does not light up the Canon SD 600. Seems to be the right shape, but maybe the amperage is wrong. I guess you have to pay the exorbitant Canon price for a spare battery."
2,Leonard Cohen,"I will review this album, but, as yet, it has NOT arrived! When, or if, it does arrive I will try again."
3,Wish I could have picked the tracks for this one...,"Whoever did the choosing, Leonard or a label executive, concentrated on too many gloomy songs for my taste. I have been a Cohen fan since before he made his first album (he came to public attention first with a novel) and saw him in concert around 1971. How could ""Joan of Arc"" be left off an ""essential"" collection? How could ""The Captain"" from his ""Various Positions"" album? There were other songs from that release included here, but none as good as the one I like. Leonard has not created a slew of happy songs, true, but the ones that exist are just as worthy as his lengthy, poetic, dirge-like compositions. Too many of those on here, in my view. Still, especially on Disc One, there are lots of good things. I found my copy of this at a bargain price, so I am happy...but it could have been much better with a different mix of songs from his 45-year career."
4,Solid collection,"The Essential Leonard Cohen 3.0 is a collection of music from unique Canadian musician Leonard Cohen. From his early works like Suzanne to his middle of the road favorites like Hallelujah, and I'm Your Man favorites like Everybody Knows, Tower of Song, First We Take Manhattan, and the album's title track,this is a solid collection.The 3.0 version contains a third disc not included on the original album package. What is missing here that I would've enjoyed hearing is Light as the Breeze, the Leonard Cohen song that Billy Joel covered in 1997. Hearing the Cohen original would've been a good inclusion, but other than that this is a solid package."
5,"Leonard, a genius","I love this album, as well as all others by Mr. Cohen. I'm a late fan, but have purchased almost all of his music. Riding around in my mini-cooper with Leonard singing to me.....ahhh! that says it all."
5,A poet and musician,"As another reviewer noted, you clearly hear the words. Not only great music but great poetry. Listening to this now. A treat to mind and soul."
2,Remastered?,"And what for? I'd have expected some noise reduction in the songs of the first CD (for example, try The Partisan). The original recordings were noisy. This remastered version keeps all the noise, but now the sound is even poorer than in previous releases.All in all, the selected songs are a good representation of Cohen's musical career."
4,Learn Something New,"I did not know who Leonard Cohen was until XM radio - then I heard a program of his music ---- he really was amazing and I love the ""gruff"" kind of voice - just adds to his music -- somehow even songs you know from other more well-known people sound better when he sings his own music."
5,A different listening experience,"I don't normally buy a CD but a friend insisted. I love every song-so unusual. The words are different, the beats, the content, all good."
1,HACK,Leonard Cohen is a hack. If you want to hear how Hallelujah should be done go buy Grace by Jeff Buckley. Leonards voice reeks of death. (and hes a hack)
5,A Superb Compilation of His Finest Work,"I had the privilege of meeting Leonard in his 20's (I was in my late teens) and while he was recognized as a poet of some note he was not yet regarded as a musical genius. Listening to his music now takes me back to those days and reminds me that in today's modern era they do not compose music of this complexity or deeply moving beauty. If you are not in a reflective and somber mood when you start listening, you will be in short order. To put it another and less elegant way; this ain't dance party music. It's music for the ages."
2,to bad about the arrangements,"I love his voice, and I think his words are profoundly moving, but i find the the background 'noise' fack strings and washes annoying (to be kind) - it's like jazz musicians who must have a 'strings' album which only dilutes the strength of their voice on the instrument. Leonard's voice has enough 'depth and mood' to save humanity and the arrangements just make it sentimental."
3,Non-essential Leonard Cohen,"I have every album Leonard Cohen ever recorded, and think that he is a brilliant but somewhat uneven composer. This collection should have contained his absolute best material, to introduce non-fans to the full range ofg his talent. Yet, there are several negligible songs included here, while some of his best known and most beloved are omitted. Where are Joan of Arc and So Long Marianne, or the trenchant Field Commander Cohen, the brilliant Dress Rehearsal Rag and the mesmerising Iodine?Still, you have to start someplace I guess. If I were you, I'd start at the beginning and work my way through, but if you have no Leonard Cohen in your collecyion, this will do, I guess."
5,it keeps getting better,"The songs just keep getting better and better. I play it at work, I play it at home and in the car. Everyone who comes into the store wants to know whos voice it is.proudly I say ""Leonard Cohen"""
1,Cohen cd,Was not what I expected guess ordered wrong cd with wrong songs that I do not like and should have returned it
4,Discovering Leonard Cohen,"This compilation shows the range of Cohens' songwriting, from somber philosophic meditations to light little riffs. Well recorded, but the releasing company (Columbia) sure isn't doing the fans any favors."
5,Cody Russell,The Essential in deffinetly an essential. this is Leonard at his best. when i sit and listen to him i feel new world opening before my eyes this album is a must. its an eleven on my 10 point scale
2,Disappointed,"My first exposure to Leonard Cohen was hearing Allison Crowe singing ""Hallelujah."" I was awestruck so I decided to get the Essential Leonard Cohen. Bad decision! The man barely breaks out of a monotone and sounds like he's terrified that someone will hear him above the accompaniment.He's another artist who should continue writing but let others perform his works."
2,"Very Disappointed ...Thoughts from a Cohen ""First Timer""","I had never heard Leonard Cohen's music but saw references to it frequently when looking at other singers/songwriters. Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed. I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable. Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best. Specific example that speaks volumes: listen to Cohen's singing of his ""Hallelujah"" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on ""Grace"" which was recorded in 1994. Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song. It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy. ""Tant pis, vers le bonheur."""
5,Awesome,"Don't know how I haven't known about this man for so many years of my life but this is without a doubt one of the best CD's I own. Would also recommend ""Songs From the Road."
4,Leonard Cohen,"I was a little bit uncertain of buying this CD because it was so long I had listened to Leonard Cohen. But it was a pleasant surprise, a very good CD."
5,Leonard Cohen,I've practically worn out these CD's. Wasn't familiar with Mr. Cohen until I heard him singing Halleluiah at the doctors office. I had to have it.
5,Where It All Began,"Polly Murray presents an incredibly well-documented, detailed account of her family's bizarre cluster of symptoms which began in the 1970s. Her style is factual and direct. A great read for any one interested in Lyme, particularly it's origins - surfacing in and around Lyme, Connecticut in the 1970s. Once you've read this book, I highly recommendLab 257: The Disturbing Story of the Government's Secret Germ Laboratoryto complete the picture."
3,Good Fragrance Bad Bottle,I bought this to it out and it smelled great. The prayer did spill it all over my gym-bag though that's why its getting 3/5 stars from me.
5,Review of Does your House have Lions,This is a great book for any age. This book is not to difficult to read. It is great for a little short reading each day. SHe has little short poems on each day that give you depth and insight without being to hard to understand. She also gives you something to think about through out the day. This is a good book.
4,Cool album!,"This album spawned more hits than its predecessor,HASTEN DOWN THE WIND. Memorable tunes include a cover of the Everly Brothers' hit IT'S SO EASY,a cover of the late Warren Zevon's personally penned POOR POOR PITIFUL ME,a cover of BLUE BAYOU,first recorded by the late Roy Orbison and the Jagger-Richards classic TUMBLING DICE. Linda Ronstadt must be a fan of the Everly Brothers since she previously covered WHEN WILL I BE LOVED which was first recorded by the EB. The follow-up album,LIVING IN THE USA would become a hit."
3,Great voice,"I love her voice, but I could only get into about half of the songs on this album. Her rendition of ""Blue Bayou"", and ""Its so Easy"", made this album a worthwhile purchase."
4,Classic from a classy lady,"This is easily the best Linda Ronstadt CD and I would have given it five stars if it was digitally re-mastered. Although I have to put up with the time and cost incurred in ordering from USA, it's still worthwhile for any collector because of the far superior cover design and packaging vis a vis the Australian version."
1,"Very ""Bad"" TV","Nice TV design ,BUT it starts off with a humming noise, then it gets louder and louder, also after about 4ms it's starts to crack and make loud noises when you turn it off, and these are problems no one has a fix for. do some reseach on this TV before you buy it, NOT GOOD."
5,Sharp & fast one-handed opening,"I had a few criteria when buying a knife: must have a pocket clip, must be able to be opened quickly with one had, and sturdy enough to stand up to being a utility knife. This has held up wonderfully for over a year and is still going strong.The spring assisted assembly can get clogged up with lint, but you can keep it clean with some compressed air. I've disassembled to clean, but that's definitely not for the faint of heart."
2,"buck , not in a rush","small knife , slippery in the hand, weak opening springs. i was a litte dissapointed. doesn't hold an edge well."
2,Not Good for the Money,"The knife is less than decent quality, and the price tag doesn't fit it. The steel could use some improving, and the lock isn't the best. As for the factory edge, it is nice, but doesn't hold. I gave mine a coarse micro-serration. It is only good for light use, and I do not trust the lock. The only thing good that I can say about the knife is that it looks great."
4,Innovative Featured EDC,"Buck offers a lot of choices in folding knives. For the money, I think this is one of their better offerings. The drop point blade came sharp and appears capable of holding its edge. The size is reasonable for an EDC. The safety lock takes a bit of learning (rock back as opposed to slide back), but it is easily mastered. The assisted opening feature brings the blade fully open with authority (some assisted openers seem to wimp out on occasion). One of the features that I like is the orientation of the belt/pocket clip. When you remove the knife from its clipped status, the blade upon opening will be pointed away from you. The vast majority of folding knives I own are (unfortunately) just the reverse, i.e., you have to re-orient them by 180 degrees before opening them."
5,perfect,"Bought this knife as a replacement for a knife my husband lost. He is very happy with the size and quality...a perfect ""pocket"" knife."
3,One of many parts,The shank was a good length. I still had to go get the nipple for the end but it works nicely in the new keezer.
2,physics for the first time,"My son said for a beginner in physics, this book is not at it's simplest form. So I found myself disappointed , but the chemistry is better."
5,GREAT BAG!,I love this bag...it is the perfect size. GREAT QUALITY AND PRICE!! I look forward to purchasing more Nvie products! Amazingly fast shipping! AND it is sooo cute!
5,haven't heard this one yet but...,"The last one ""Turn the Dark off"" was f*cking amazing super jamy jam jams."
4,Klezmer-Jazz ...Fusion?,"While I dig the Jewish standards and vibist Terry Gibbs compositions presented here,I'm not so sure about the arrangements/collaboration with his brother and drummer Sol Gage.For me,if this was intended to be Jazz-Klezmer fusion-it just doesn't entirely fuse and as an experiment,I think the balance is a little off,beginning with the first track 'Bi Mir Bis Du Shoen'('To Me You're Beautiful' in Yiddish)which begins and ends with short riffs by Sol Gage's Klezmer- 'Jewish-style group-withGibbs' jazz quartet taking over everything else;I think pianist Alice McCord(who later married John Coltrane)steals the show."
3,"BEWARE, BEWARE!","Just because it has 4MB doesn't make this a great buy (you'll use less than 1MB unless you do a lot of drawing). Royal's customer service is among the worst in the industry and there are no downloadable applications for this. Royal is still working out some bugs with the hardware and software (keep a current backup and check your battery levels regularly), but this works as a decent organizer.... If that's all you're after, then this might be the buy for you, but if you want more (games, additional applications, etc.), you'd be better off with a Casio (PV400) or one of the... Palm models (M100, M105). The keyboard is cute, but hardly functional. The synchronizing software is adequate, but buggy. But hey, this thing isn't all bad. After all, I do own one, and I still use it."
1,STAY AWAY!,"I received this as a Christmas gift. I have replaced the batteries 4 times already, the last time was one week after new batteries were put in. That brings me to the big problem, everytime I have replaced the batteries I have had to reset the unit. The screen went blank, the print was half gone and now there's a big black spot at the bottom of the screen. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Excercise DVD,I got this DVD while I was going through radiation from breat cancer. A friend recommended it to me and I'm glad she did. I didn't have a lot of energy and needed something that I could work out with slowly and build up as my energy level came back over time. This was a good way to get me moving again without going overboard. As my energy level came back I was able to move to the more advanced workouts.
1,"Sorry dudes, but nah not really. Don't buy!!!!!!!!!","Having all their other albums up till the point this one came out, with Ass Cobra as a clear fav, I had some expectations. Ah, but no. The sound is so incredibly bad, that it makes Ass Cobra sound polished, which I'm sorry to say is not a good thing, their version of ""I got Erection"" lame beyond belief and quite frankly, if you're there and @##%ed up on various stimuli, then it is rather cool to listen to the moronic stage patter, but dead sober it is just right down embarrising listening to Hertis (the lead singer) shouting the Norwegian word for, you know the pleasure center of women, for 5 minutes. Ah well they can't all be as good as Ramones' Its Alive, but this bad??? Come on!!!!"
2,"""Ripp Tha Game Bloody"" Review","Average album from West Coast veteran, RBX, released from Daz Dillinger's independent imprint, Gangsta Advisory. RBX, who came up with Snoop & Tha Dogg Pound during the Death Row era of the early 90's, never really had a breakthrough solo effort despite a ghastly flow and an ominous voice. ""Ripp Tha Game Bloody"" has a few decent tracks but is far too guest-heavy to be considered a solo album. All-star appearances by Snoop on ""Tell It! (The Remix)"" and Daz on ""Jus... Murda"" are pretty underwhelming but his collabo with former Doggystyle artist, E. White on ""They Run"" is the highlight here. There are some other worthwhile tracks like ""Summer In The City"", ""Crime"", ""RBX"", and ""Picasso"", but for the most part, the album is nothing special. Another problem I had with the album is that it has no production credits, thus all of its young unknowns continue to go unknown. ""Ripp The Game Bloody"" should have been more."
3,Not too bad,This product is ok. It's not quite as good as I thought it would be though. I usually use the GNC Super Digestive Enzymes. They are awesome. I wanted to try something a little different. I have to say that I will go back to the GNC product
5,GREAT!,"If you are an amotour of German tanks of WWII, this book is made for you!I'm an italian student and I find the language not very difficult, so it's accesible for everyone. And there is the greatest list of tanks, self-propellede guns, semi-tracked vehicles I've ever seen!"
4,Mile wide and a foot deep,The book gives a great account of all AFV in the German inventory. The short comings of the book are evident in the lack of color photographs and information regarding how the unit was used/performed in battle.
3,CORRECTO,"Buena coleccion de fotos, clara separacion de los distintos modelos de tanques y cañones de asalto ademas de las distintas variantes ""raras"" de blindados que los alemanes utilizaron en la segunda guerra mundial. La informacion tecnica esta claramente estructurada en las mismas secciones, blindaje, armamento, velocidad, etc, en todos los modelos se indica en tres breves secciones la historia de su desarrollo, su fabricacion y su papel en combate aunque en mi opinion se quedan algo escasos y podrian haberse extendido con algo mas de informacion."
4,Otimo Livro....,"Estou escrevendo essas linha pois é uma forma de de facilitar o acessoa a informao que representa esse livro...É um livro bem técnico de informaes reduzidas mas bem específicas. É um livro realmente muito bom, vale a pena..."
4,It rocks!,"I bought this for Children's church for the title track, Shout to the Lord. I was pleasantly surprised by the rock beat and the utter joy of the music. My 10 year old puts this music on to dance to. Some songs are better than others, but overall, this is an enjoyable praise CD for kids, especially older kids who might not like the ""little kid voice"" music that so many Sunday School music tapes have."
5,Parent of 3 1/2 yr old and 2 year old,This CD is great. My wife bought it at a Hearts at Home conference. Our children refuse to listen to any of there other tapes while traveling in the car. They absolutely love the music and are quickly learning the lyrics. We find ourselves singing along. This is not just a tape for children. Adults can enjoy this music to.
2,Kids album? Misleading at best,"Working in children's music ministry, I picked up this album with much anticipation... however, that was short-lived. The Integrity Music/Hillsongs marketing machine can't seem to get enough distance out of the ""Shout to the Lord"" brand, so they slap a kids title on an album that features very little of the namesake. (Maybe they have learned from the ""Left Behind"" brand ... sigh)While there are some great tracks with kids on the album (""Every Move I Make"", ""Worship You Forever""), this is mostly an adult album, with a token assortment of kids sprinkled in. Christian record labels still don't seem to ""get it"" when it comes to kids and worship. The pacing of the middle tracks make it hard to sing-along in a larger group setting. Also, the length on the tracks tend to be a little on the long side for a young child's attention level.I'll take last year's ""Kids in Worship"" release from Sparrow Records over this album anyday..."
2,plastic colors,"All I can say is the plastic pieces were colorful, the octopus squirted about 3"", the canon watergun shot about 1/2"" after it was throughly submerged in water. the whole thing was about as amusing as the washcloth in the tub with our grandson. Don't waste your time with this, get an old plastic milk bottle if you want some great reactions. This was boring and sat at the end of the tub, unplayed with. Maybe the pirate should take the porcelin bowl tour for better adventures."
1,Glad I didn't pay for it,"My son received this as a gift and it's just awful. Yes, I submerged it but it still doesn't float properly. The canon has never worked and the octopus barely squirts at all. This is just a lame duck toy, period."
2,not worth it,"This toy was a waste of $$ for our little one, I do not recommend it to anyone. The squirting parts do not work well on ours, and it is big and bulky. Just not worth buying in my opinion."
2,Bowl for soy source,"I tried to buy a rice bowl. So, I bought this bowl. However, this was so small. I should buy another ones. This was good for some sauces such as soy sauce, etc."
5,"transcending ""-isms""","The word ""postminimalist"" gets thrown about frequently when Paul Dresher's name is mentioned. Though certainly inspired by Reich, Glass, Riley, et al, Dresher's music consistently transcends the neat little boxes that critics and scholars alike use to tie music to one historically-based tradition or another. This collection of four works provides an excellent introduction to Dresher's vibrant and versatile musical world. Though frequently relying on electronics in combination with acoustic instruments, his music never falls into the ""gee whiz, look what this machine can do"" trap that has caught so many other composers. I find the two completely electronic works, ""Underground"" and ""Water Dreams,"" to be particularly beautiful soundscapes. His theater works, though markedly different in style from the pieces on this disc, are also highly recommended for anyone seeking a respite from bland, cookie-cutter Euro-American academic music."
3,"Do I promise to watch this DVD again and again? I do, I do!","This volume contains two episodes: ""Matrimony Mania,"" and the 12th season $100,000 winning episode special - each approximately 40 minutes in length.The main attraction includes clips of wedding day mishaps such as a fainting groom, a teetering bride, best men, altar boys, ministers and a bride's maid who all topple over respectively, bratty ring bearers and chaotic animals. Also featured are the $100,000 winning ""Hallelujah Breakdown,"" and $10,000 winning ""Mystery Kisser"" clips. The ""Tight Jacket"" clip, however, will always be one of my personal favorites.Tom Bergeron hosts both shows."
5,Perfect for seniors battling dementia.,I bought this for my father who has dementia. He laughed and laughed. He can watch it over and over and keep laughing. We love it!
1,America's Funniest Home Videos - Love and Marriage,"Very disappointed with the video, the title shows you are buying a video of weddings now more than half of it, is not of weddings. The clips are good, but very, very old so the quality. I WAS FORCE TO GIVE A STAR for the rating it should be ""0"" out of 5"
4,Hamilton Park Book,"After much research and hard work this documentary of the Hamilton Park Community is as accurate as we can remember and shows how a community can work together to foster change and solidarity. If you want to know how a community was a real village to its homeowners, the educational system and inclused the local governments in their planning and their decision making, this is the book for you. All community leaders in this country can become inspired by seeing how the civic leadership of Hamilton Park in Dallas, Texas helped to be a gatekeeper for city, county, school board, parks and recreation. flood plain, entry and exit road construction and much more.Dr. Thelma Wells, President, A Woman of God Ministries, speaker/author/mentor and former president of the Hamilton Park Civic League. [...]"
1,The product was never received for the supplier...,I cannot comment on the product --- I placed this order one month ago and have yet to receive the book or a reply from the supplier.
2,Disappointed did NOT work.,"This product is great, except it did NOT fit my application!'92 BuickDieHard batteryI compared this bolt to the original, it IS 1 MM shorter in length! Will just BARELY grab the battery threads. Won't even tighten down. With the original positive battery cable, and even a after-market NAPA battery cable terminal, this bolt is simply too short, even for the short GM bolts. :("
1,Do not recommend this,"I got this carrier at my shower and was excited to use it.And my excitement plummeted in a second when I found that it was nearly impossible to place my baby by myself.I tried laying her and sliding her in, picking her up and placing her while I am in upright position. Very difficult.It was much easier if I unsnap the sides and the bottom, making more room within the carrier, but then it became such a hassel to snap them back on to make it snug for my baby.Then I tried Baby Bjorn, and oh boy, what a difference!!I found that you can adjust the Bjorn while I have my baby inside. But with the infantino carrier it was really hard due to a poor quality of buckles and straps (the kind you'll find on a cheap backpack).This also primarily uses snaps to adjust the size of the carrier and this is inconvenient.The price is affordable, but better to invest some $ and buy Bjorn or Ergo, or buy a moby wrap with just about the same price."
1,Piece of Crap,Got as shower gift and used all of 5 minutes. Directions non existant. Such a mess. Took is over an hour to figure out and just plain sucks. Waste of money
3,Read this years ago,"I read this novel years ago when I was about 12 and I have never forgotten it.I think the book terrified me partially because of the morbidity and yuck factor, but also due to the very real description of someone having a breakdown.As far as I remember, the novel highlighted how vunerable teenagers are, and how the ""Adult"" can make decisions that ultimately destroy the innocence of a child or teenager."
4,It took 30 years because...,Sly's contactual entanglements were a mess. Credit to Sony for getting it done in fewer than 40 years.
1,this is not resmastered or very badly so,"The music is first rate and deserves 5 stars. But fans of sly were waiting for a remastered version of his classics. They are not, or so badly that you can hardly hear the difference with the old cd's. Come on, this dude deserves the same treatment as james brown, the beach boys (very good remasters) or the rolling stones. This is a miss opportunity."
1,Great Artist - Lousy Compilation,"This compilation is a real disappointment. The 1st CD includes all the hits one would expect, but the 2nd CD doesn't expand on the fertile time period when these hits occurred, instead, it includes newer tunes, probably done with different personnel, that are just not much good. And remastered? It doesn't sound any better than my existing, worn out greatest hits CD. Take a pass on this one or, if you have the energy, write EPIC and let them know how badly they missed the target."
1,sly& family stone,i was looking at songs i notice some songs like hot fun in summer time is a single version maybe its me is there a full version of this song if there is where is it ? until i see the full version of this song and others not buying this cd sorry what a rip off
5,Comfort yourself with Sly and the Family Stone,"Ah, Sly and the Family Stone, and this album offers The Essentials. Beautiful, fun, upbeat songs, still as fresh now as they were then. ""Thank You"", ""Hot Fun In the Summertime"", ""You Can Make It If You Try"", ""Stand"" and ""Everyday People"" and all the others are here. If you came of age around 1970, these songs were most likely a part of the fabric of your life, and still just as sweet and comforting now as they were then."
4,Cornerstone of 70s Soul/Funk music... A must-have for collectors!,"No complete story of American Black Music, can be written without recognizing the contribution of Sly & The Family Stone to Soul and Funk.Wanna know why? Just listen to ""Everyday People"", ""Thank You Falletin Be Mice Elf Agin"", or the superhit ""Family Affair"". All three -and much more- are included in this double CD album.Considering the low recording standards at the beginnings of the 1970s, Epic Records has made a fair job in remastering all the best hits of S&TFS; to issue this ""Essential"" collection."
4,Childhood memories...,"My stepmom..now my mother, played 60's/70's soul, funk, just good fun music...nothing complicated about it!PS...thanks Mom...for exposing me to various types of music!"
4,A devious little treasure,"_Nightmare's Disciple_ is a delightful piece of suspense building off the premise that the Cthulhu Mythos is real and its cultists are active here and now. That being the case, how might the creatures of the Mythos manifest themselves in the modern world?Like with many of Lovecraft's own stories, we are left unsure how much of this nightmare is a product of the characters' own madness and how much is ""really"" there. Especially striking are the characters who own the horror shop, who gradually come to realize that their hobby is more than just fun and games.I don't want to say too much more, lest I give any spoilers. Mr. Pulver's novel doesn't perhaps have the *cosmic* feel of Lovecraft's best mythos stories, but it is an admirable (and I think successful) attempt to suggest how near terror may be to what we naively think of as our everyday life."
2,Almost a total loss,"The idea might have been good, but the execution is staggeringly inept. The entire ""novel"" consists of conversations between uninteresting characters, and the conversation consists almost entirely of recitations of lists. These lists, which can go on for pages, are lists of mythos- influenced authors and artists (some fictitious), imaginary mythos books, imaginary artworks,etc., etc. And when the author runs out of mythos steam the characters endlessly list pop music groups and their compositions (some fictitious), obscure horror movies (some fictitious), obscure classical works (mainly fictitious), and so on... you get the idea. The author, Pulver, has apparently been a music critic for most of his professional life, and he never leaves the day job far behind. With no characters one can give a dump about, no action, really no plot, and a text consisting almost entirely of irrelevant padding, this is one of the most unrewarding reads I have ever suffered through."
1,Hot Air,"I cannot truly express how let down I was by this book. While the idea behind it sounded quite interesting, the execution was terrible. This story could EASILY have been about 200 pages shorter and the story wouldn't have suffered, instead the reader does. The book is stuffed with volumes of dialog that just seems to be Mr.Pulver showing off how many obscure bands(movies,books,etc.)he can name. The whole thing comes off as an amatuerish vanity piece, with no sympathetic characters at all. Poor editing, poor writing, this book has it all. Save your money and buy ANY of the other fine books in this series. This ""Nightmare"" is one you'll wish you never had."
5,A refreshing read,"I have not read a horror book in 18 years, but this was highly recommended by my wife, Ris. I tepidly aproached the idea, but the first few pages caught me. Mr. Pulver, if you read this, PLEASE make more horror stories! You have a gift. I now read horror stories whenever I can and would greatly appreciate if you would continue producing. Thank you."
3,A solid modern Mythos thriller,"Pulver's very modern take on H.P. Lovecraft's sprawling myth-cycle isn't just a reheat of the same old shoggoths. Both diehard Lovecraft readers and _Call of Cthulhu_ gamers will find a lot to like here. Imagine a fast-paced serial killer thriller combined with solidly researched Lovecraft . . . and set to a driving, streetwise cultural beat. A novel for fans, by a fan -- one that delivers what we read the Mythos for."
1,"Had hopes, was disappointed","I love Lovecraft, but this book was such a disappointment that I threw it away immediately after reading it."
2,Flimsy,Not a real heavy duty wiper blade. I never installed it because it looked so flimsy. Would pay a little more for a heavy duty arm that will hold up in the elements.
4,Wha?,"The title of this review was my reaction as I listened to this CD. To appreciate this album it may help to be unfamiliar with Mr. McLean's work. Perhaps I will grow to love it as much as I like every other Jackie McLean album except ""4,5, and 6"". However, this is still a better album than the great majority of jazz albums, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Mr. McLean plays unadventurously (which is, of course, highly uncharacteristic), but I did not get the feeling I often get when I listen to other players that he was just running scales. The other players are also excellent, which would be expected. I particularly liked Cedar Walton. This is a fine album even though it may leave long-time McLean fans dumbfounded for a while."
3,Not McLean's best setting,"Jackie McLean is a master...but as the amazon reviewer rightly said, he's at his best when he's blowing his guts out on hard-bop and things of that nature...when he really could play with some edge. And while he and the rest of the band are still good (Cedar Walton is a superb pianist) this setting really isn't the best for him, as it's mostly ballads. It's not bad, but it's not all that inspired either. A pretty typical selection of standards too. Jazz is often hit and miss, and unfortunately, this leans more toward the miss."
4,This is what employers want.,"We've all seen the lists on job finder websites of skills you need to succeed, but this book goes into excellent detail of exactly what, for example, a good communicator is, or what it means to have a strong work ethic. The author has done extensive research on the topic and has helped thousands of students get jobs."
3,"It's a bit dated and there's lots of graphic ""filler""...","The framework of this book would make a good syllabus for a ""career success"" course at the college level but somehow it falls short. The full-page graphics with historical quotes don't seem to match the layout of the information - which keeps it from being a higher rated effort. I bought it used and cheap on Amazon and it was useful for what I needed - to show my students some of the critical skills employers value - that they seem to think are just ""filler"" courses at the college level...The Ben Franklin quotes don't add any value or meaning to the text and a better organization and update of this information would make it a much more useful and practical selection - I donated my copy to the school's career center... Prof. Mike E."
5,A No-Nonsense Approach,"I took this book out of the library to assess what I actually learned in college. According to this book I fall way short of the mark. I should be angry for having spent around $51,000 for a mediocre education which not only didn't prepare me for the job-market but also didn't help me to learn any job skills which would have been useful. They were either taught haphazardly by my professors and/or were completely non-existant in my classes.(AND I went to what is considered a good school).I'm not angry and I am glad I did the assessment so that I can work on attaining those skills in graduate school. To a new student on their way to college and smart enough to be preparing for the work world I advise you to follow the advice since it will be helpful for you to secure a half decent job offer. The world is so complex that if you don't teach yourself what is missing then you will find yourself out of the loop. Good luck with your education. It is what you make of it."
5,An Enlightening Read,"Turner's book is insightful. He lays out perspicacious arguments for why even far-left theories of indigenous rights fail in their ability to account for the real needs and wants of aboriginal peoples. If you are genuinely interested in understanding the reality of indigenous politics as practiced by non-native peoples, and how government policies affect indigenous populations against their will, this book will be eye-opening, especially if you are already someone who considers oneself empathetic towards others and objective in one's judgements about social and political policy. Right-wingers and left-wingers will get a lot out of this book. A helpful exercise in this regard: imagine oneself in the indigenous position (the ""golden rule"" is Morality 101)."
1,Another lousy Christian self-help book...,"My entire church was forced to read this book last fall as part of its teaching series. In a church of 1000+ people, I have not found one person who liked the book.The author makes it seem as if we are all cripped by some common phobias and that we are paralyzed by fear. While some of his premises are fine, most of them are just generalizations and pure grabbing at straws.Maybe this has some applicability for those who live in the Bible belt and who aren't too worldly, but for those of us who have been around the block, it's just another feeble Christian self-help book."
5,"Excellent follow-up to ""Not Necessarily Acoustic""","Steve Howe spent two years in the early/mid 90's touring as a solo act. The ""Not Necessarily Acoustic"" CD was a snapshot of the first tour and ""Pulling Strings"" documents what went on in the second tour. The first album was universally hailed as a ""must"" for any guitar player. This album just echoes those feelings. The songs were taken from performances in Chicago & Minneapolis, and are flawless. In the liner notes, Steve gives ""Special thanks to everyone who came to the 'Pulling Strings' and 'Not Necessarily Acoustic' tour dates, 1993-1995"". My response is ""YOU'RE WELCOME, STEVE! and Thank you for allowing those of us who attended to see a guitar legend up close and personal."
2,Not Howe's best,"Steve Howe is one of the finest guitar players there is. He is also the worst singer of all time. It is bad to such an unbelievable level that surely his producers, friends and fellow musicians have told him not to do it. And yet here again is a CD with about 8 or 9 tracks that are almost unlistenable because of his vocals. The other 8 or 9 tracks are instrumental and very good. While there is some singing (fortunately less than this CD)on ""Not Necessarily Accoustic"" , it is a much stronger collection of guitar work and is the live Steve Howe CD to have. ""Quantum Guitar"" is probably Howe's best studio work and, no surprise, has NO SINGING bogging down the great guitar playing. The Steve Howe Album is also excellent. The beauty of CD players is that you can program in the good songs to hear without having to listen to a whole album. On this CD you need to program in the instrumentals and leave out the cuts with Howe singing."
4,The only CD to hear Marion,"Sadly, this is the only CD on which to hear Marion (outside of her appearance on various band leader discs). While hardly studio quality recordings (these are old radio show clips), these recordings ARE a real pleasure. Her spontanaity preceding ""Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree"" is a joy.Be forewarned: the sound on some of these songs is scratchy and/or muffled.If you're a fan of Marion's, this is well worth the purchase.(If you don't already have it, pick up ""The Best of Abbott and Costello - Volume 2"" for a beautiful transfer of ""In Society"", co-starring Marion.)"
1,all you will receive is a small piece of rubber -misleading picture-,I have had the C330 for several months and have grown tired of switching the suction cup mount between vehicles so I decided to just buy another one. That would be the mount that is shown in the picture. What actually came was a very small suction cup (not even like the oem piece). In fact the suction cup I received can't even be seen in the picture! With shipping and restocking fees it's not even worth sending this one back so don't waste your money!I like the oem suction cup mount as I have never had any problems with it - even with all of the moving between vehicles. I found the complete oem mount (w/ power cord) on Amazon for ~$30 and purchased that.
1,NOT SO GOOD,"HAVING TROUBLE WHEN I GET OUT IN THE SUN WITH IT. iT FALLS OFF THE WINDSHIELD WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD. hAVE TRIED EVERYTHING FROM WETTING IT, TO USING DOUBLE FACE TAPE ON IT & NOTHING WORKS."
1,Wrong Item,"Item is not the item shown in the picture. Called company many times, but customer support is useless. Not worth it to send it back and pay for shipping and restocking fee. Do not buy unless you only need a little useless suction cup."
4,Does it;s job!,"It sucks! I mean sticks well! So long as it is mounted on a smooth surface (glass/Plastic, etc.). Fits my I5 Street Pilot"
1,Don't buy this,This suction cup mount came with the GPS. After about a week the GPS kept falling. No matter how hard I tried the suction cup won't hold for more than half an hour. The GPS system is tossed around the car and you can't stop the car while driving to either get the system or fix it. Garmin should not include this cheap product with an expensive system. Don't buy this item...
1,Don't bother to buy it,"I bought Streetpilot i5 that came with this suction mount. The suction mount fell off all the time, no matter how I treated it such as wetting the base, pressing it hard, cleanning the windshield. Wetting the base seems working for a while, but then nothing can win over the gravity. The mounting part is fragile, in my case, after two months of operations (stick it on the wind shield and take it off) it no longer wants to hold the air. Bad product even though the GPS itself is wonderful.I'm ording the dashboard mount, hope that would work better than this item."
4,"Brother Tom, special","Today (10-09-2012), I finally saw The Jeffersons ""Brother Tom"" and laughed so hard.I was reminded of the time this episode was aired and knew of the feelings of the times and I found itridiculously funny. You have to remember the times when people could laugh at each other in fun! This was funny and the out of time mannerisms made it more funny!"
5,Liked them all so far.,"I do like all the other season's that i do have,and only watched some of the show's of season 4 and liked the one's that i did watch.I seen most of the show's when i was growing up and i think they where rerun's at that time.But i can't wait to get the rest of them. and see what else George Jefferson get's into."
5,We're Past the Halfway Point Now!,"It's great to see that the sixth season of ""The Jeffersons"" is now slated for release, just seven months following the DVD set of the fifth season. This puts the series on DVD past the halfway point now!Despite the fact that this set is bound to be similar to the previous five (with no extras and some video tape picture problems), it is still a worthwhile purchase just to get these classic episodes in their original, uncut CBS broadcast versions. Each episode that I can view in this fashion, as opposed to the butchered reruns shown on TV Land, is a great thing in my opinion!Supporting this box set should only serve to give Sony Pictures Home Entertainment more faith to continue releasing this series on DVD. If you enjoy this show at all, please shell out the few dollars it will take to own this one. Let's see if we can't get all eleven seasons released!"
5,A Wet Dream Come True,"Not the best Turbonegro album. Not the most technically challenging. Lyrically good, but not great. So why a five star review? Because, after all of these faults, there's something about this album that draws you towards it. Not as widely known as there other releases, this still ranks as one of my favorites of them. I rank it 3rd, behind Apocalypse Dudes and Ass Cobra. However, I would not reccomend Ass Cobra to the average person. This is a better place to start. ""Suburban Prince's Death Song"" just might be the best Turbonegro song of all time, and representative of the album. Heavy, yet melodic. Definitely one of the most overlooked albums of their career."
3,Duh,Any fans of Turbonegro know that this album is incredible..and if you don't know who Turbonegro is...you suck..and you should crawl under the mainstream rock from whence you came from.ALL HAIL THE TURBOJUGEND!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Lacking sparkle!,The performances here are very correct and yet err on the conservative side... orchestral tuning is not always so accurate and yet I find the tempi to be fine. Not the best Haydn out there when one considers the poor recording and sound given to these famous works...try Colin Davis with famed Amsterdam Concertgebouw for a really good time in Haydn!
1,Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,"Somewhere folks have gone off track in thinking that climate change and anthropogenic influences are matters of belief or politics, though those are clear underpinnings to this video and its supporters. Go to the real research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change whose membership is 195 countries and whose report to governments was signed by more than 1500 climate scientists. The information is there. Unbiased. Clear. Unbought. Available for reading and understanding. Denial won't change the science any more than believing Copernicus was wrong made his scientific findings wrong, or that not accepting evolution changes changes your DNA. If you go to a doctor when you are sick, you place faith in the science underpinning the medicine. Read for yourself. [...] If the link doesn't hold up, just do a search for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."
5,Bah humbug to global warming,"As a skeptic of the global warming craze, I was happy to see the depth of scientific debunking of the GW theory. I would like to see a rebuttal of the film by scientists on the other side. We need a serious dialogue to hopefully lead the country and maybe Western society to evaluate the possible effect of man made polutants on the environment so we can be more realistic about available resources notably oil and gas, coal, and nuclear power."
2,Not strong enough,"I use this film in conjunction with An Inconvenient Truth to show my students both sides of a debate. Putting the fact that I don't support the claims of this documentary, this is just not as well produced as An Inconvenient Truth, so it is difficult to take it as seriously."
2,"NO, NO, NO!","You will NOT be happy with this! This is incredibly buggy on both the hardware and software side. Royal will NOT respond to your inquiries for help with this product (they say they will, but trust me on this one). The picture you see isn't even the DV2, it's the DV4. If you must buy a Royal PDA, get the DV4, but you will be frustrated and disappointed if you get this one. Run, don't walk, from this item!"
5,MUST HAVE,"BECAUSE THESE ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND AT THE DRUGSTORE, I AM SO GRATEFUL AMAZON HAS THEM. I LOST THE USE OF ONE EYE MANY YEARS AGO, SO THE PATCH IS PART OF MY EVERY DAY LIVING."
1,Very though and cheaply made,"I bought because it was supposed to be soft and comfortable.It is made of carton, it is tough and REALLY uncomfortable. Even worse if you plan on using them with glasses, since they stick out and don't let you put them on.But even if you don't wear glasses, they are horribly hard and cheaply made. I would have gained the same quality from cutting a piece of cardboard box and uniting it with rubber bands.Botton line, don't buy it."
2,Uncomfortable,I didn't like this patch at all. It let a lot of light in and was not comfortable at all. If you want to use it to help correct a lazy eye then I would look elsewhere.
4,Pleased,I have opticneuritis (sp?) and this patch ofers me a safe and effective means to improve my vision. The service was top notch and I would't hesitate to purchase again.
4,Not for sleeping; OK to walk around,"Bought one for relative who need protect one eye from dusts and light (e.g., TV) during sleep. The box says ""Made of Soft, Smooth Material."" However upon opening it, the black cover is actually a piece of matte black hard paper/card board wrapped like a wide cone. So the middle of the patch is actually the sharp edge pointing outward. The trim which makes contact with the skin feels like thin cloth. So it's definitely not suitable for sleeping.Our secondary use is also for walking around during the day and protect from light. It does the job of keeping very dark, but still not comfortable for extended wear but OK for short duration - all depends on you. It's light weight, but I think if the whole thing is made out of cloth would be lighter than it.I could see this be useful for other purposes, but not what we need. Cheap enough to use as a disposal patch."
4,its actually a Flents Eye Patch,The product Orion sells is really the Flents Eye Patch Regular One Size Fits All. I wanted an eye patch that was for telescope use but this is just a regular Flents eye patch. You can get it for $1.99 elsewhere. I guess it works ok for telescope use...its nothing Orion actually makes though.
5,Movie Review,"Amazing and knowledgeable---everyone should watch this video, and research their own health and well-being----you will find that money drives the allopathic industry and if you research this answers will be revealed that are shocking yet enlightening"
3,Fun illustrations,"I found this book on a sale table at a toy store, and it was a pleasant surprise. The bright, colorful, cartoon-like illustrations are fun to look at. Each page describes the animal's features (giraffe's long neck, fat gray hippo). This is one of my 18 mo. old's favorites, and he has quite an extensive library. I am definitely going to check out some of the author's/illustrator's other books. I'm not quite sure why they've listed this book as a 4-8 reading level. My son has loved it since he was 10 mos. old."
4,baby must-have,"This has been one of my son's favorite books since he was six months old. He is one now and still loves it. The illustrations are bright and simple, yet captivating. I would definitely recommend this for babies and toddlers."
3,you may not care to know,"I'm a big fan of prefuse73 and I was interested in this because a friend recommended it to me..well I wasn't really disapointed...I just wasn't that interested. It's true he has some cool melodies and samples...but his drums just weren't what I was looking for, as they came off sounding to loud and much more in my face than I was hoping for, think more ""Push Button Objects"" rather than Prefuse...the cd is growing on me little by little, I was just turned off by not getting what I at first expected, okey dokey I give it 3 stars...try the Caural CD it was what I expected and you can give a listen to on Amazon! ;)"
2,Not so great,"I bought this towel for the beach, but after receiving it, I can definitely say it's not what I expected. The towel is way too thin to be of use aside from maybe sitting on. Don't expect to do much drying with it. Another thing, the dye is cheap and you can see some running."
2,Not suitable for bright under counter lighting,"These sounded like they would be a great replacement for our fluorescent under counter lights of similar length but they really aren't; the light provided is not nearly as bright as the fluorescents and the LED light is somewhat blue rather than white.Also, the LED's seem to be spaced too far apart, there are shadows within the illuminated area."
3,OK but not super bright,OK but not super bright but good design and able to hook up more is a great feature...for the prce you save alone in electric cost
5,WOW,Big Al is awesome. I am a big blues fan and Big Al Dupree is an awesome piano and Sax player. I can't wait to buy more of his stuff.
2,Would not get again,Start button switch went out after 4-5 months and have to keep fooling with it to get it to go on!! Is crummy monitor
2,Not what I expected...,"It has a promising story, but it's development drops abruptly...I am sorry to say that, for me, this was a wearisome book."
1,Dumb book,"I picked this up at the library, and i am so glad that i didn't waste my money on it (like with Aragon, another DUMB book). This book started out slow, kept on staying slow, and the ending sucked. sorry to ruin the ending *SPOILER ALERT* but any book that ends up with a whale blown up and the female lead killed by a pair of kids is a bad book. This guy, while providing an interesting view of non-American life, knows nothing about whales and relationships, which is fine if he weren't writing about them. get it at a library if you must read this book."
4,cute bear,"Springtime has pretty pastel ""spots"" that look like jellybeans. We didn't read the ""ad"" carefully, so it was a fun surprise that Springtime also has crinkly-sounding legs and a squeaker inside. Our daughter likes her new bear."
1,"Unusable, notably with XP","Don't buy this product. I have Windows XP and I need to reset it about every hour, sometimes even every 10 minutes, because the wireless link will crash continually. Also, I never could use the print server, which only works for simple printers and not e.g. HP OfficeJet systems. In retrospect, I'd rather have had a router with more ethernet ports (this one has only one). It's never really been stable, but since I got XP it is hopeless (even if I do *not* let XP manage my 802.11, which also appears buggy)Update - I decided to get the MR814 from Netgear. Should have done so months ago. All problems gone, much better signal, more ethernet ports and it looks better as a bonus."
1,Many problems logging into the web based setup utility...,"Web based setup utility looks pretty. Was impressed at first. Great documentation. Don't change the internal LAN IP address or DHCP scope. I have had to firmware flash the unit several times. Works for a while then can't reach the unit again through the web based setup utility. Called tech support, sounded like I was not very bright for changing the internal scope. Guess it would be better to re-scope my entire LAN? Why is the product capable of re-scope? Very dis-satisfied with the product. Have purchased another brand, very stable product, unlike the Linksys, very satisfied now. Have had problems with a Linksys ethernet print server, also in the past. Will never buy Linksys anything again. First time to complain like this in my life I think."
2,Drops Internet Connection frequently,"I've owned this product for just over one year. It drops the Internet connection so frequently, I've lost count as to how many times I've had to reset the device. Now that it has just slipped out of the one year warranty, it has dropped all wireless functionality.I don't recommend it."
3,Longevity is questionable.,"Worked well for about 18 months, then started to require frequent reboots. Finally the power supply or something else has died. On hold with tech support, it appears longevity of this product is the main question. Reading other reviews, I wouldn't recomend a purchase of this product."
3,"Ok, For Firewall and Options","This is NOT a very smooth Linksys product for Windows XP, nor do they have drivers yet. A 3 star rating for WinXP necessary, but not sure for another Windows OS. I have extensively tested this product for XP - not the best performer I've seen from Linksys.It installs alone through XP very well, but it would be a bit of a pain if you didn't have much experience with XP Setup of WI-FI and general networks. If installation is attempted from the CD, the Network settings and Connections get confused.BOTTOM LINE - As for the wireless connection(s), they do not stay connected indefinitely. The router requires a RESET after so many hours.I do like all the security options, they are very useful and fail-safe. The installation software was well written for it's purpose, but not very XP compatible (yet?). DO buy this for Win 9x Applications/Uses if you don't mind resetting the router every so often, but I couldn't recommend professional use."
3,It's Aight,"Installation is easy, pretty much a plug and play.Don't pay much attention to the manual as for it has a coupleof mis-leading information. Such as the default IP being 192.168.0.254 , when it's 192.168.1.254Range is really not as advertised. If when said Indoors they mean a Warehouse (only 4 walls), you , the router and a computer, then probably yes.But Indoors as people would understand (inside house) is MUCH MUCH less. As a previous post mentioned. 1Mbit at 50ftthat's (16 Meters)I also faced the ""large data transfer"" lock ups.But once you have it configured. You dont have to thikn about it again.Just make sure your Wireless CARD is configured properly (right channel, right SSID) and...""Infrastructure"" setting, not ""adhop"" as factory default and as mentioned in the lynksis wireless card manual.TechSupport is GREAT, maybe I was in luck. Close to no wait time and in 5 minutes all my questions where answered."
1,Device is defective and manufacturer is unresponsive,"When I've got data going through the device to the Internet, I end up with either stray lines across the page that aren't there when there's no traffic to the Internet, or the page being ejected (form feed), or both. I'm on the latest release version of firmware (1102). I've also emailed tech support several times and have received no reply. I've verified the problem is the Linksys device by using two different printers (HP & Canon) plus a dedicated Lantronix print server. Only the Linksys configuration fails. I first thought that there was some electromagnetic interference between my cable modem and the Linksys, but I've separated them physically by over 20 feet, and they are on separate AC power circuits. My only way to print is to unplug the cable modem so that the Linksys can't send any traffic. I wish I had not bought this device!"
3,"good general performance, some problems","I just received the BEFW11P1 wireless router on July 23, 2001. Installation was pretty straight forward. I just followed the instructions. My setup is a desktop PC with CAT5 ethernet, Dell Inspiron 8000 with Dell truemobile 1150 wifi card, & Hawking 5 port hub.Everything works as advertised, except, when I try to move large amounts of data the router locks up and no computer can network (wired & wireless). I have to unplug the router for a few seconds and it will work again.There is a firmware patch on the linksys site. I haven't yet tried it.As for the range, I have used it indoors 50 ft away with 3 walls in between, I still can get about 1Mbps."
2,"Poor range, don't use the manual","I am surprised about the good rating this product received. It has given me quite a headache for some time. Configuration is not as easy as it could be and only works if you ignore the manual, which is about as confusing as can be. You must make sure to set the DNS server right for it to work, and that's not explained, you may also have to set up passwords and logons for your internet provider. The range (stinks). I barely get 20 feet and one wall. Indeed, I had one card that had poor transmission over 5 feet without a wall involved. What did Linksys's tech guys say to that (after a 17 minute hold time)? ""Bad luck, if it works at all, it's not our responsibility. Do you get transmission directly next to the machine? If so, the unit works"" We'll so much for excellent tech support."
1,Do not buy this product,"I got this product a few weeks ago. It was regularly crashing. Finally, after working for about 3 weeks, it died. Linksys first issued an RMA and then offered to replace it with a model without the print server on it. However, they are not willing to refund the difference. They specifically told me that this product is being discontinued, because it is defective. ..."
2,Print Server Does Not Work,"After serveral calls to Linksys tech support which is horrible, I found the print server does not work with Windows XP. I'am returning it"
3,"Good performance, a few problems","I forgot to mention in my previous review, in my observed throughput of 1 Mbps...that's with my cable modem which gets that speed. If I run the wifi card monitor, it shows that the wireless link is near 11Mbps all the time even at 50 ft"
2,Weak inconsistant signal,"This was NOT easy to install. It took a month back and forth to the computer store to get the right PC cards, then replacing with the USB card because the Linksys PC cards require 100% use of the computer port of choice. So back to the store to get a USB powered port adapter. Now, brand new, the signal for 40 feet between computers varies dramatically from zero to 100% and frequently disconnects from the DSL on the computer sitting directly next to this unit. It works (finally), but intermittantly, which is useless. Since it took me two months to figure all of this out, I cannot return it. Tech service suggests I purchase the BEFW11S4 unit because the antennae are better.DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!"
2,No Setup CD,"instead of putting setup CD for the printserver, Linksys puts utility cd for some other products. so the printserver is useless. Moreover, the support never reply email regarding this issue."
4,works great...but,This product will work well if it is the only router on your system. Linksys tech support is having trouble helping me configure mine with an existing linksys four port router....
1,Linksys has Horrid Support,"I received the product and follwed the instruction manual to the letter and am unable to get the product to work. Linksys technical support is virtually non-existent and I have lost at least one day trying to get them on the phone. No-one answers their phones, it is nearly impossible to get a human being on the line, and when they do answer, they say that they will have a tech support expert call you back...THIS CALL BACK NEVER OCCURS. I would not by this or any other product from Linksys."
3,So - so,Certainly not what I thought it might be. I didn't really find any new ways to clean anything and certainly no faster ways.
2,How to book,"Personally I did not find a lot of help in this book and areas I did, I found the solution not to work."
1,I didn't learn much.,"I found this book dissappointing. It overstates the obvious. Unless you are totally clueless and never had to pick up your room as a kid, you probably know all this stuff already. A waste of money."
5,Couldn't put it down and didn't want it to end,I read this book and sat through most of it with my mouth open. I could not put it down and was so very sad when it ended. I e-mailed Ms. Jossel and was very shocked and pleasantly surprised when she wrote me back. I wish her much success and would recommend her book to everyone that I know that is a lover of reading. Great job Ms. Jossel. Can't wait for the sequel.
5,Outstanding,"I thought the books was wonderful. I read the book in one day, which meant I was late for work, but it was worth it. I cant wait for the sequel to be released. Please keep up the good work."
3,This Novel Is Average At Best.,"I know I'm in the minority here but I have to give my honest opinion on The Root Of All Evil. It reads like a first draft. The plot and characters are all over the place. There were too many storylines going on at once and then the last third of the book tried to muster up all kinds of twists and turns that just weren't believable.I don't think this author's writing is terrible, it just needs work in terms of story flow and character development. Maybe hiring an editor that will give honest opinions would help.I borrowed this book from the library and would consider borrowing the sequel if it's ordered. If not, there's no way I would buy it, too big of a risk for my hard earned dollars. But if you're a risk taker then be my guest in buying this book and don't say I didn't warn you."
5,More stars please!,"This book was a two day read for me, and without doubt worth the paper it was written on!! Joylynn M. Jossel has me on the edge of my seat waiting for the sequel. The main charactar, Klarke Taylor, devises the ultimate plan to snag bestselling author Reo Laroque. Unsuspecting Reo gets caught up in Klarkes twisted scheme and a course of events take place that change the lives of everyone involved. Klarkes two friends Breezy and Jeva also have drama in their lives that hit the fan. This story of ones relentless pursuit of the almighty dollar is one I won't soon forget."
2,NO GOOD,I swear this book was NO GOOD. It was only good in the last 30 pages I SWEAR.....It was only a page turner up until that point. If only the rest of the book had the same thing going 4 it. Yes it was riveting and a page turner as the other have said but not until u get 2 the end of the book. It was a waste of some trees if u tell me!!!!
5,VERY GREAT,"THIS BOOK WAS REALLY WHAT THE TITLE WAS "" THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL!! THE FACT WOMAN'MAN WOULD DO WHATEVER TO GET WHAT THEY WANT."
4,Riveting!!,"The thesarus finds riveting as being:-enthralling, exciting, spellbinding, interesting, thrilling or captivating...just to name a few and that is exactly what I felt when reading this novel. Indeed I was spellbound by the fact I bought it Monday afternoon and finished it Wednesday and probably could have finished it the same day had it not been for work! It kept me glued to each page, waiting, hoping, wondering what would happen next....and the sensuality was off the hook!-deep....I was especially pulled to the main character Klarke that ultimately, without giving away any story lines had me in tears. There was no character in the book that I did not like....everyone of them brought something to the table in their own unique or negative ways. There were story lines that I am sure many people can relate to or KNOW of someone who can relate to.The story line was absolutely wonderful and never would I have imagined the end."
2,It wasnt good,"I did not enjoy this book. It was filled with errors,both spelling and grammar errors. The book did not keep my interest and the characters were not that entertaining. This book is only decent in the last 30 pages."
3,iT oNLY GOT GOOD TOWARDS THE END,IT WAS A MEDICORE BOOK. I DONT C Y EVERYONE IS RAVING OVER IT FOR REAL. IT GOT GOOD TOWARDS THE END BUT DONT BUY IT. BORROW IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE
5,Excellent Read!!!,"In ""The Root of All Evil"", Joylynn Jossel spins an unforgettable tale of what happens when the perfect plan goes terribly wrong. This book was so captivating that I read it in one day! BE WARNED: this book will throw you completely off of you daily routine; you will not be able to put it down! If you don't have this book, buy it now!Look for the sequel that hits the shelves this winter, ""When Souls Mate"" to find out what really went down with the drowning of the baby!"
5,A very rewarding book,"I was thoroughly impressed with the first book Transformation, and I thought it couldn't get any better. Mrs. Berg has taken me above and beyond my expectations... and even then some. I was surprised at every turn. I had a very hard time putting this book down and I would have read it all night if I could have. You feel every emotion and take every painful step with the characters. A book worth reading over and over again."
3,Revelation,"I read Transformation about a year ago, and lent out the book to all my friends. i work at a book store and when i found out that there was a sequel to that book, i was so happy and ordered it immediately. I got the book and noticed it seemed quite larger than it's predicessor. it took me less than a day to finish revelation. it's a complex book, with a lot of twists and turns. It's a good book. and the characters are well developed, but it delves a lot more into religion than i'd like. and it leaves the history of the Ezzarians a little up in the air. Like what actually happened to cause the separation, and what the mosaic was all about. and the ending was just too up in the air. it'll need another sequel to appease the masses. it's good, read it. but i wouldnt give it 5 stars"
3,Gratuitous Torture?,"I found the sado-masochistic Gastai section in Demonland rather disgusting and detracted significantly from the book. I don't think it added anything significant to the story. I wound up skimming this part (yes, yes, another brutal beating, blah blah). Why do some fantasy writers insist on adding this twaddle? Not sure I will venture into the next installment of this..."
5,Funny!,"This book is extremely funny especially if you know Latin. Being a Latin student I thought it was very funny and enjoyed the CD very much. I reccomend this book and listening to the CD because with the CD you can't even tell that they're singing Old McDonald or other stuff.(monks ar singing) Also, the pigs in the story talk in Pig Latin which adds humor."
2,A one-trick piggy,"Don't get me wrong. I love Sandra Boynton's work. I've been a huge fan since the first time I saw a ""Hippo Birdie Two Ewe"" card, longer ago than I care to remember. I bought many copies of the Chocolate book and give them to new friends when I hear they love chocolate.I bought this Pigorian Chant book/CD when I heard about it. But for me, the joke extends too far. After reading the cover and hearing about a minute of the CD, everything else is repetition -- more of the same joke."
2,Boring!,This CD was kind of boring. Didn't interest my daughter as much as Sandra Boynton's other works.
5,PoIGnant. A masterpiece of misplaced erudition,"Anyone with a classical degree, proficiency in early American schoolyard slang, a musical heritage and a sense of humor will revel in this work of breadth and brilliance. Highly recommended to the overeducated eccentric. The CD should be played as background music at your next party. Those who notice and comment are to be cultivated as friends worthy of greater interest."
3,"Clever, Not for Toddlers","There's no denying that this is clever, well-written material. But our toddler, who loves the other Boynton book/CD combos, can't really get into it. What's more, unlike the other discs, this one is somewhat annoying as background music.Serious chant aficionados may disagree, but I think it's best to plan on sitting still and listening to this with the words in front of you to really appreciate it. But you probably won't need more than one or two listenings before it gets tiring. The concept is clever, and the execution is very good, but the joke wears thin pretty quickly.Parents should also be aware that this isn't really like the other Boynton material (such as ""Philadelphia Chickens"" and ""Rhinoceros Tap""), and it's not really music for kids. They might learn to enjoy it (and maybe they should), but it's definitely not in the same vein as those other more simple and tuneful works."
1,Big mistake,"Bought this product, in the description, the weight is 327 pounds.When however I received it, the weight was aprox 100 pounds, were absent important departments from the product, paid for shipping & handling about 330 USD figuratively for 327 pounds while it was much lighter.This product cannot function without the departments that are absent, am very disappointed from the transaction"
3,Pretty good,"I think these are tasty. They are healthful and convenient too. One package is 2 seriving sizes though, so beware. The calories beat peanuts any day, the health benefits are SUPERB. I'm eating better, watching my carbs and these fit into my lifestyle. I think they take some getting used to, but overall they are tasty, satisfying, and are pretty filling too."
3,It's ok...,"I love the Sensible Foods snack line, but these are not as good as the rest of their products. I found them to be a little bland. I gave them to my vegetarian friend who loved them so maybe if you love soy nuts then you'll love them too."
1,Have not received this product.,"Ordered on January 8th, but as of February 10th, I have still not received this product."
1,very disappointed....,"The authors really do not know much about mountain biking. I was excited about the idea of the book, but sorely disappointed by it."
2,does half the job,"A long time ago (and I'm talking 80's) there was an album (yeah, vinyl) called SOUNDS FROM THE WOMB; one side was something like this. What was different it was that it really addressed the problem with babies sleeping; it started out on side one with actual sounds from the womb and gently, slowly introduced classical music toward the end. Side 2 continued that until by the 1/2 way mark, it was all classical music, thereby helping the baby get used to sounds other than the heartbeat & pumping of blood while in the womb. I haven't been able to find it yet, but if you want a good product find that one - you and the baby will be better off."
3,Wilton vise pedestal,"This pedestal is okay but not as sturdy as it looked or as it should be. The problem appears to be flex in bottom plate. It should be 3/8"" steel rather than 1/4""."
4,Listen to it!,"FIELD RECORDING is a great mixture of acoustic and folk music that has a lot of emotion and feeling. I love how Doug Carman plays all of the music instruments on this CD, and I especially love Doug's lyrics. This is a great CD; I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Nice and strong!,I have only used them once so far to oil a teak table and chair set and I was very inpressed with the duability and fit of these gloves!
5,New Australian Writing Talent,"Broken out into 4 separate tales - each one winding in and out of the other - this is a well crafted first novel that is satisfying to the reader. Set in Perth and Melbourne, Australia, the book examines human relationships across time within a family. the author's style is reminiscent of tim winton (ala ""cloudsteet"") - another great aussie author - so if you enjoyed that, you will enjoy this read."
4,Heist- a must see,"Peter Rossi's ""Heist"" is a must see. He captures the world of mobsters and con artists with such intensity that you are glued to the edge of your seat."
4,Its really pretty good!,"This is some of the most intersting techno music I've ever heard. It sounds a lot like Orbital, I think that if you liked Orbitals music you would probably enjoy this CD. Its great and it makes you really want to listen."
5,This Flick Rips!,"This is a really really cool video. I bought it for my nephew hoping it would be both ""safe"" and ""authentic"" and these guys hit it right on the head! There is no swearing, drugs, or sex refferences so it's cool for kids, plus these groms are really pulling MAJOR tricks. I would have never tried a kickflip rail at 10 years old! Too cool. Any moms or dads out there looking for a good safe skateboarding film for your youngsters THIS IS IT! My nephew loved the film and has watched it 10 times already. Plus the music is really cool too!"
3,Like.?.... I Do - but only one track,"The Motown pastiche ""Like I Do"" is a superb mid-tempo track with a haunting feel to it. The songwriter credits include Holland-Dozier-Holland so that explains the Motown sound. For me that song is worth the price of the cd. The rest ? Well, inoffensive enough but who cares when you have a gem ""Like I Do""."
1,one good song,"This is not a cd I would recommend purchasing. There is only one good track on the whole cd - the Dallas Austin produced ""Like I Do"" - a Diana Ross & The Supremes inspired number...the rest is very dull, cardboard cut out r&b."
1,VERY DISPLEASED,"I bought this shower curtain for my brother when he was having a rough time in his life with his roommates who ditched him in housing. I ordered this around March or April.....he has never TO THIS DATE received it, and I have tried relentlessly to get my money back. I guess sometimes you have to just cut your losses, but I am extremely livid with this company and I would NOT recommend going through this business with ANYBODY! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Sad Eyes,"I hope they show the ""Sad Eyes"" episode here. It's one of the cutest episodes, in which Lizzie gets a job and learns that work is really hard, and also learns a lesson about the value of $. It starts when she asks for a raise in allowance, looking really cute and begging her mom and dad, smiling oh so sweetly, and then when her mom disagrees, resorting to the sad eyes. How can you say no to the sad eyes? But her mom did, and off storms Elizabeth Brooke who is determined to prove to her parents that she can be responsible and earn her own money. Classic episode."
1,Just plain bad.,I don't know why everybody loves Lizzie so much. The show is OK but that's it - and these episodes are just plain bad. Watch better Disney shows on Disney Channel like That's So Raven and Kim Possible.
4,"Great Show, But we need a Season 2 set","I'm 21 and I still love this show. I think it is a lot more intellegent than a lot of other shows geared towards teens these days. The reviewer who made the comment about the blonde girl always getting the cute guy, obviously they haven't even watched the series. Lizzie's central theme is about friendship and family, NOT about getting the guy. In fact, Lizzie never ""gets the guy"", so to speak. And the main male character in the show isn't the ""cute"" one. He's the nerdy, smart one. Lizzie is also not the popular girl, her and her friends get a lot of grief from the popular crowd, and this show has much better character development and depth to it than any other Disney ""teen"" series I have seen."
3,Uberloopy,"Sorry guys, but I just don't understand all the recent incredibly glowing reviews. This stuff is OK - the 30-second clips on Amazon sound very nice, but what you don't realize until you hear the entire songs is there is a LOT of repetition of both melody and sound/voice samples. A band like Kammerflimmer Kollektief or Lemon Jelly can get away with repetitive melodies because their sampling is so interesting and varied, but on ""Duniya"" there are just too many instances of the same sounds and voice snippets being repeated over and over. The music is pleasant, and the intertwining of various cultures was perhaps more groundbreaking in 1995, but nearly 15 years later there are more engaging and dynamic choices in electronica/world fusion."
3,Choking hazard?,"My 3 month old baby has been mesmerized by this toy for the past 1-1.5 months -- loves to watch the beads move and clink as I rotate it in front of her. Now that she's able to grab at things, and put them in her mouth, though, I've had to put away this toy. While there's no indication that this toy is about to snap, with repeated wear (and lots of drool) it seems pretty risky. If stuffed animals with plastic eyes are considered to be age inappropriate due to the possibility of the eyes popping off and becoming choking hazards, it seems to me that this entire toy is composed of choking hazards and shouldn't be chewed upon."
3,So-so,"I bought this toy for our then 2 month old boy - as long as I held it in front of him, he was interested. However, at 4 months now, poorly coordinated as he is, he manages to whack himself in the face as he is trying to fit the toy in his mouth - leaving him frustrated. Going to the bottom of the toy box - perhaps awaiting better times?"
2,Missing the concept?,my girls didnt really take to the toy. mabye they were too old at 12mos then. but it basically just flatens- done manually. it was too un-interesting for them.
2,"It is a toy for adults, not very safe for little babies","We loved this toy at first sight, and brought it shortly after. Now we felt we might had made a wrong decision.The problem is: small babies don't have the ability to control this fancy toy very well. When they tries to move it to them, some sticks/edges might start to poke babies' eyes. Sometimes, when babies move it too quickly, it will knock on babies' heads rather hard. It is a dangerous toy for little infants, but might be good for toddlers (so we still haven't thrown it away :) )."
2,too complicated for infant,"It's too complicated for an infant, she is 6 months and she is not interested in it, will see when she grow older"
1,Dangerous for teething babies,"Our 6 month year old loves grabbing this toy but every time he tries to put part of it in his mouth, another part of the toy ends up poking him in the eye. Definitely a safety hazard. We returned it and got a refund after pointing this out."
5,Great toy!,Great toy! Just got it for my daughter and she seems to enjoy it. She is 3 1/2 months old and I think she will continue to enjoy it as she gets older and she can manipulate the sliding pieces. It appears well made and is great with the colors.
3,Unexpected disappointment,When I purchased this item for my daughter's 6 month old twins I was very happy with the quality of the product and I thought the sounds the wooden beads make and the elasticity of the toy would be a sure hit. It is very easy for them to hold and the colors of the beads are beautiful but so far they are not interested in it. They have held it and tried to chew on it but quickly become bored. I am still hoping they may become interested though so am holding out for that to happen perhaps when they're a bit older.
5,All three kids enjoyed it!,This was a gift and one that has lasted through all 3 kids baby stages. My youngest is really enjoying it.
4,Skwishy fun,"I bought the classic Skwish for my daughter when she was three and a half months old. At first I would have to pick it up and show her how the beads moved and make them rattle. After a day or two I was questioning my husband if he had handed it to her, because I would hear rattling coming from her playpen. She was picking it up on her own and playing with it. Whenever it is within reach, my daughter who is now four and a half months reaches for it, plays with it rattles it, and sucks on it. She plays with it for over thirty minutes at a time and loves it. We do always make sure someone is within earshot while she is playing with it, because although it seems very well made, we want to make sure that if someone how the elastic breaks or a bead breaks off we are close by."
4,Not made in China!,"I'm having the hardest time trying to find toys appropriate for my four month old son that are not made in China. The tag on this one states ""Made in Thailand"". Anyway, my son doesn't have difficulty grasping it and bring it to his mouth. He also likes to look at it when we jiggle it. So far it seems like a good buy :)"
2,Concerned About Choking,"My 3 month old loves this toy and is very interested in it, but I am worried it might be a choking hazard. He immediately puts one of the toy's wooden balls in his mouth as soon as he picks it up. I am concerned that one of these balls could come loose and cause him to choke. I closely supervise him when he plays with this toy, but as he gets older and stronger I may have to retire it. I bought the Skwish after I bought Manhattan Toy Co.'s Winkel. My baby loves the Winkel -- it is all plastic and appears to be much safer -- it does not have balls that could come loose. I would recommend the Winkel over the Skwish. My fear of choking might be unfounded -- as my husband said, Manhattan Toy Co. has been around since the '80s, but in my mind, it is better to be safe than sorry."
3,My 5 month old loves it - but it seems unsafe,"Oh what to do here. I want to give it 5 stars as my baby loves, loves loves this toy. He loves teething on the wooden beads. However, I am constantly worried that the beads will dislodge and or/ he will be poked in the eye. I don;t want to be over protective and take it away but I am concerned..."
1,Disappointed.,"I read all the great reviews, then bought it. Very disappointed. My 9 month old can't ""squish it"". Its colorful, but not very entertaining for her. She investigates the two sliding beads, but then runs out of ideas for manipulating it. Not fit for children under 12 months, in my opinion..."
1,Father more interested than 6 month old baby,My son liked the toy and bought it for his 6+ month old son. My son plays with it more than baby. Toy looks dangerous as it could be used as a hurling weapon. (My other son chipped my front tooth with a baby rattle he hurled.) Tiny fingers could get caught under the beads when the black links are stretched. I personally think this is a toy designed by well intended geeks who do not realize babies are want to chew on things. This is not a proper chew toy. This toy should not be used without 100% supervision. This toy offers nothing more than looking like a fun toy for parents.
1,Not what I expected...,"I got this toy for my 9 month old, thinking it would be a fun addition to her other gifts under our tree on Christmas morning. When I looked at the picture and read the initial descriptions of the item, I was picturing something that both expands and contracts... That is not what this toy is/does. My daughter seems to enjoy it a little, though most of the play she's done with it has involved her trying to use it as a teether. It is a squishy ball (as it's name implies), but I think it will hold very little appeal to her for very long. My only consolation is that I purchased this toy on sale for only $4.99. Had I gotten it for full price, I probably would have returned it."
3,"Baby likes, doesn't love, this toy.","My baby likes this toy. He doesn't LOVE it like some others, but does enjoy playing with it occasionally."
2,Elastic Gives Out Quickly,"It's a great design, fun to look at and handle, but the elastic cords connecting all the components wore out pretty quickly, completely ruining the toy. I wouldn't buy another one. Disappointing."
1,warning - major choking hazard,"My 5 month old, teething baby pushed this into her mouth and choked.Those strings are stretchy, so if you shove one of the sticks into the mouth, it can go all the way to the throat.We were lucky I was right there when that happened. She gagged and vomited, that was all. But if I wasn't there and she pushed it harder,.... I don't even want to think about it.Please be safe."
1,Beware Poor Quality,"I am really, really disappointed and unhappy - with this toy and with Amazon. I ordered this toy about 7 weeks ago and received it 6 weeks ago. My now 6-month old son has played with it - gently, I might add. And it broke this morning ... ""snap!"" went one of the flexible black bands, without any warning at all. The toy is broken and part of the educational appeal - the ""skwishiness"" - is gone.Add to that the fact that Amazon will not in any way refund or exchange the product because it's just beyond the 30-day mark, and I'm one unhappy shopper.The worst part is that this was our whole family's favorite toy, so we are of course compelled to buy another."
2,Looks pretty but does not provide much play and fun for my baby,"This is a nicely done and durable toy that provides little opportunity and creativity for play and does not interest my baby at all. The only thing it does, is bending according to the strings and bouncing back into its original shape. I bought it for my baby when she was six months old and now, two months later, she has maybe played a total of 2 hours with it. Save your money and invest it in something more useful, e.g. wooden building blocks."
4,For a 6 month old this toy rocks!!!!,"Very durable, and my 6 month old loves it, can be shaken, banged, thrown, squished, and the colors are awesome. A very basic toy, easy to clean, and apparently entertainment for hours. Was the best Christmas present she got this year. I will be looking for more Manhattan toys as she grows."
4,"Great for little hands - light, durable, colorful, with a pleasant ""noise"".","I bought this toy for my 7 month old daughter - who is almost 8 months old now. The first time I'd seen it was when she was about 6 months old, at a friend's house, and she just loved it while we were there...which is why I bought it. I think she would've enjoyed this toy more at a younger age - it's very light, durable, and easy for such small hands to hold. Now she's at a point where she just chucks it across the room and I feel like a dog playing fetch :) I think I like the toy more than she does, especially the sounds it makes. Perhaps she'll begin to enjoy it more again, who knows what cycles these little ones go through, right? :) Overall, I would recommend it and plan to buy one for a friend who is expecting."
2,"Pretty, but not safe for infant play","This is a neat looking toy, but seems dangerous with all the little balls, not fit for chewing on. Most importantly, it seems to hurt my baby - she has handled it twice with interest and both times ended up with her crying out in pain - I am not sure what happened, but this toy has been put away for now. it is also pretty heavy/clunky for a young child."
5,Great for holding and sticking in the mouth!,"Our 6-month old absolutely loves this toy! It's very easy to hold, so he doesn't drop it much and it's perfect for sucking on. We ""inherited"" this toy from some friends, so it's not new but we don't have a problem with it breaking as some other reviews mention."
4,Christine,"I've always liked John Cougar ... John Cougar Mellencamp ... John Mellencamp, or whoever he is at the moment. He's an earthy down home type of guy and this CD is pretty good, maybe a little too commercial but who's in a position to judge. I like this guy, I just wish he'd quit smoking so we can keep him around a little longer."
5,What's Dylan got on this guy?,"Rodeo Clown, Rural Route, Freedom's Road, Forgiveness, Jim Crow and Someday all rank right up there with the best Mellencamp songs. I just wish Rodeo Clown wasn't a hidden song...it might be his best, right after Minutes to Memories or What if I Came Knocking."
3,Another side of John Mellencamp,"I enjoy this new side of John Mellencamp. Even though he sold ""Freedom's road"" for a car commercial. We all have to live."
5,Best CD I've purchased in a very long time,"I originally purchased this CD for the song heard in commercials, ""This Is Our Country"". What I found were several heart & conscience wrenching songs that I cannot get out of my head. I highly recommend this, but I would buy 2. You might wear the first one out!"
4,Love the songs,"This is my first Mellencamp CD and I love the songs on the CD. I didn't give it 5 stars because there is a technical problem with this batch of CDs. The last song (maybe it's really 2 songs) has a 2 minute gap about 4 1/2 minutes into the song. I got it replaced, but the replacement had the same problem."
4,Enjoyable music.,Any Mellencamp fan would like this Album. It's got a beat that you would like to be rolling along to on your next summer drive.
4,Worth listening,"This is classic Mellencamp that is covered in ethics, philosophy and history. The music is soulfully rhythmic and steady. For the most part, it has a ""stop, listen and think"" quality that is typical of John's songs. Although I like most all of the track contained here, I have to admit that this will not knock off my any of my top three Mellencamp Cd's. That being said, this is definitely worth buying."
3,Pretty good cd,"Johns new cd is pretty good but his playing on his guitar & his voice might be suited better if he did soft rock songs, blues, & somecarriebean style music as well. George"
2,Not one of John's FInest,"Sorry Mr. Jason Stein, but if I wanted to hear my former favorite singer spout politics, I'd challenge him to a debate. Singers are paid to sing and entertain, NOT be political. I stopped liking Mellencamp as much as I used to the moment he started directly bashing political figures in his songs..... SHUT UP AND SING!As far as the album and tunes themselves, this album is definately not one of Mellencamp's finest. Not even close. Trouble No More was a better Mellencamp album, and they weren't even his originals!"
4,Music to my ears,"History, Nostalgia, Politics - Hope, despair, disappointment - The Simple pleasures and tragedies of life. Wistfully yearning. More ""Scarecrow"" than ""Lonesome Jubilee"" with a little ""Big Daddy"", ""Human Wheels"" and ""Trouble No More"" mixed in. Patriotic and God Fearing it gives a strong dose of Mid- Western values. As always, we know where he stands, he's not afraid to tell us and by doing so we are reminded that we can strive to be better, demand more, and beg forgiveness - Melloncamp at his best."
3,I really like the hits but the rest is a big miss.,I really like the hits but the rest is a big miss.
4,Another American lets unite CD,"I like this CD but it sounds like alot like his Scarecrow CD, not in the sense of the same songs but the same theme, he seems to keep driving home the messege of american ideals and I think we have been down this road already. Im sick to death of hearing ""Our Country"", everytime I turn on the TV that song is playing in a Chevy commercial, i think hes beating a dead horse...enough already, we get the message. good song but we dont need to hear it every 30 seconds. I think John Mellencamp is a great songwriter but this CD is just another way of saying, Hey everbody, let get together and eat apple pie and be like the old days in the 60s, sorry but those happy days are long gone. In todays world thats not going to happen. anyways, good CD but seems to repeat a message he gave us back in the 80s..."
3,value for money.,This is not a review but a question i have the full set of orkney views and have indeed sent in many articles over its time.i fail to understand the high price you are asking.i can still buy copies localy at a cost of 2.00 english pounds.what is a fair price.how did you reach your listed price im wondering?
5,Bonus Buddy's Best Clarinet...,".First there was Johnny Dodds:1927-1928;1927-28.Then there was Pee Wee RussellAsk Me Now!.There was Jimmy Noone:Three Little Words/I Know That You Know.And Barney Bigard:1944-1945.And Buster Bailey:1925-1940.And of course there were Goodman and Shaw:Together Again! (1963 Reunion with Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson & Gene Krupa).1945-1946.But finally, there's Buddy DeFranco who's rock-solid, sweetly reasonable, and swings like mad!Look for Buddy on these other outstanding Verve records:Buddy De Franco and Oscar Peterson Quartet;The Complete Quartets & Quintets.Swing on, sweet chariot!."
1,A word of warning...,"I ordered this DVD but received ""Women's Health - The Wedding Workout"" instead. Then I noticed that the barcode mislabeled the DVD as as ""Prevention Fitness Systems - Dance Yourself Thin"". Maybe this was a one-time error, but I can't help but wonder if there is whole production run of mislabeled DVD's out there."
1,HATE IT!,"I hate this product..Marie is so slow in moving to the next steps..I don't even work up a sweat. I was hesitate in ordering workout videos and ordered 4 about 3 months ago, if your interested in starting an exercise program for the new year, order 10 Minute Solution Fat Blasting Dance Mix, Jennifer is GREAT and I promise you'll work up a sweat and enjoy it! Don't let the ""10 Minute"" idea allow you to avoid ordering..once you get the steps down, you'll be amazed at how well her 10 minute exercises work!"
4,Lots of Fun...Great Instructor!!!,"I am a cardio dance instructor with no real formal dance training. I buy DVDs to get ideas for my classes which are women ages 20-60 who have no dance experience. The moves on this DVD are fun and easy. Marie is one of my favorite instructors. She goes through the movements at half tempo plenty of times for you to get the moves down before taking them up to tempo. However, this DVD is not going to get your heart rate really high unless you are a complete couch potato. However, once you learn some of the moves, you can create your own workout and perform it to a little faster music. This is a great DVD for anyone including instructors looking for fun dance ideas for class!!! Marie teaches on another video by Crunch called Cardio Dance Blast which is also a fun workout. She is also seen on two of the Dance off the Inches DVDs: Fat Burning Jam and Sizzlin' Salsa both of which are fun."
2,This could have been so much more.....,"I was so looking forward to doing this workout. I love salsa music & dancing & I love, love reggae & found it intriguing that a workout could have reggae dancing. Unfortunately this workout left me wanting more, & not in a good way. I figured I'd give it a chance, because the instructor is likeable, and the music is great. So I did it for a few weeks, got real familiar with the moves so I could really put my all into it. However, even when I really work this routine, I'm hardly out of breath. The instructor gets sweaty & I always wonder how, since this is a workout ""lite"". It is good if you want a long warm up, which is how I've used it a few times, since after I was done I felt like I hardly worked out at all. It's sad because this one has many good points, however the workout itself is a true beginner routine at best."
2,Not a very good workout,"I found that I didn't get a very good workout, my heart rate stayed down the whole time. Plus I found it to be a little bit boring. She does cue the moves in half time first, but half the time the camera is on her face while she's trying to teach you the foot moves."
3,Only Buy This if You Are In Young or In Shape,"I bought this because it is a Prevention Magazine product and therefore the exercises would be broken down into small steps that my out of shape self could manage.Wrong. It is basically aerobics. For people who are already in shape.The photography is weird. For example, you might be directed to move your feet 2 to the left, drag 1 to the right and quick kick kick kick and instead of showing you the steps, the video shows the pretty faces of the people exercising.It would probably be fun if I was 20 years younger. I am going to give it to my daughter who will probably have a ball with it."
1,Boring and Very Awkward Rountine!,"I own about 25 exercise DVDs. It is hard to get your heart rate up with this DVD. It is very slow, boring and the moves don't flow, they are very awkward."
5,"Fun, easy to follow but work up a sweat","I think this video is great. I regularly use it to shake things up a little. The moves are easy to learn but you can still work up a great sweat. you can make it high or low impact so as you get in shape, you can step it up a notch. Great for beginners and intermediate users."
3,"Finally, some different dances than the others!","Prevention Dance Yourself Thin is approximately 41 minutes with warmup and cooldown and is led by Marie Forleo. I have a couple of other dance workouts with Marie...she's a great cuer!After the warmup, there's some isolations which I kind of felt that Prevention just stuck in there to lengthen out the workout. I didn't find them to be necessary.I enjoyed both the Afro-Latin and Reggae segments, but I sure got confused when I added in the arm movements! The choreography is a bit complicated and I'll have to do this one a couple more times to get it down. I was glad to see different dance moves than the norm though...There's a LOT of twisting motions and more impact than usual. Very tough to do on carpet unless you have dance shoes. The impact can only be modified so much, so be prepared for a couple of hops here and there.Recommend to intermediates with a good background with dance videos....beginners to dance workouts will have a tough time."
2,Not impressed with the instructor,"There is a large group of dancers in the video and I was not all that impressed with the instructor. This was a little bit harder for me to follow along with. I only used it once or twice, then went back to my Jennifer Galardi DVD."
5,Fun Dance Workout,"I love this exercise DVD. Marie is a good instructor. I like how she goes over the moves more than once and slowly, before taking them up tempo. If you give this DVD a try, I think that you will like it."
4,Great time,Good workout but its geared for beginners...if you're looking for a easy fun workout this is it
5,I love love love love this video,"I rented this video from the library and as soon as I was finished, I came onto Amazon and ordered it. I like the instructor, she is a good instructor and she is upbeat. I like learning new routines. This once teaches you choreography to a couple of dances. I had so much fun! I have absolutely no rhythm, so I'm going to enjoy working with this one. Great video!"
2,The person which was taking this video is not professional,"These exersises are good. But the person who was taking this video is not professional at all. He made this like not for learning, just for watching. Sometimes he shows just her arms and you don't know, what actions she is doing with her legs. Sometimes he shows just her legs and you don't know, what actions she is doing with her arms. Sometimes he is taking video from top to down (like show), sometimes from back side and etc. And all these things just confussing you. It makes you difficult to concentrate on her.I wouldn't to recommend this DVD to my friends."
5,I love it!,I started with Cardio Dance Blast by Marie Forleo also and I like it so much that I was looking for more work out done by this girl.I found this DVD and I absolutely love it just as the other one. She is a great instructor. The way she breaks out the steps and put them together makes it so easy to follow. I am having fun and working out at the same time. It is the perfect combination. I started dancing with her like a month ago and I already have very good results. Finally my waist is shrinking!I highly recommend this DVD along with her previous one.
2,Just okay,"I thought that I would really like this video after reading the reviews. It was just okay. It didn't really get my heart rate up much and I found it to be a little boring, not too fast paced. BTW, I am used to stepping with Cathe on a 3 time per week basis and doing some sort of strengthening the other 3 days. So, if you are just starting out you might like it."
5,Prevention Fitness Systems-Dance Yourself Thin,I have two of the Prevention Fitness Systems dance videos and they are two of my three favorites. I am familiar with the teachers from earlier Crunch dance work-out videos. I have to work at it a bit to get my heart rate up to where I want it by putting in some extra oomph. But it is do-able and I very much enjoy the routines. They are the right length of time for me too. I have a small amount of workout space and am able to do these in that space. I look forward to my workout with this DVD.
2,Coordination a Must!,"I am in my 30s and am overweight. I was looking for a DVD to help me get into better shape at home. The problem I have found with this DVD, and with MANY others, is that you really need to have good coordination in order to follow all of the moves. Many times there are complicated foot movements that have left me ""marching in place"" as I try to bridge my confusion. This can get very frustrating, but I have found this to be the case with many, many DVDs. You put the thing in and five minutes later you are expected to perform a complicated, choreographed dance routine! Please, don't misunderstand: if you are coordinated and catch on to new moves quickly, than this DVD is excellent. But if you are more like me and you find yourself lost after the fourth or fifth move in the combination, you might want to keep looking."
2,Would not select this brand of tempera cakes again.,"The tempera cakes were purchased for a gift. Being a primary teacher, I had used tempera cakes in the classroom for a number of years and liked the ease and lack of waste. These tempera cakes were disappointing because they appeared to be more like watercolor rather than the solid, brilliant tempera colors."
1,Waste of money,"I found this to be a waste of money and more clutter in my house than anything else. Buy it for the trill of journaling, if you will, and to save it for your children, if you must, but it is nothing that a regular planner/calendar cannot do by itself."
3,"All packaging, not much substance","I'm a big fan of the book ""What to expect when you're expecting"" and I expected this calendar to be as full of information as the book. It wasn't. I suppose it's nice to look at the calendar and tell instantly what week you're in, but the recipes, helpful hints, and places to write your memories are pretty insubstantial. The copy I bought had a slip cover and a big piece of cardboard filler in the middle, making it look bigger than it is. Keep your regular calendar to chart progress and doctor's visits, and start a pregnancy journal if you *really* want to keep track of what's going on. You'll be much more satisfied."
4,good tool,Help keep track of milestones for comparison and journaling. I really enjoyed it. Layout was nice to put next to yearly calendar
5,Best CD I've heard in a long time,"I love Triple Image. Their songs make me feel happy. They give me a fresh, optimistic feeling like Tara Lipinski used to when she was around 15 and I saw her win the Olympics. I just saw Triple Image on Dateline. I wish I had taped it. They're awesome. They have so much great energy and there's something really special about them. I love the way they dance together and the funky, cool way they look. Their voices are great and they have their own cool accent. I think they're the best young girl group. I wish I could have a DVD of their videos. I hope they're very successful for a long time."
5,Best First CD In Years,"For a first time CD they hit the right tone... LITERALLY. Hey Now is a great song. When Cyndi Lauper did this song ""Hey Now Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" I thought it was a great song... but after hearing Triple Images rendition you will fall in love with this song all over again. All I can say is I can't wait to see what there vocal range will be in a few more years. Keep up the good work girls. Just a great first CD."
1,holy bubblegum!,"What the hell is this? Do we really need 10, 11 yr old girls making records? The Only people that listen to this crud are elementry kids that have Lizzie Mgwire, Play and Dreemstreet in their cd players, as if those cds wernt bad enough! These kid artists are getting way too annoying, dont you people find baby voices annyoing as hell? I even saw these girls as an opening act a while back, I just wanted to bat them off the stage, Their not going to get any bigger than they are!"
1,Please...this is music?,"Two of these girls go to my highschool and they're stuck up preps who can not sing. I thought it'd be interesting listening to a few songs so I spent the $11 and purchased a CD. I gave all the songs a chance and was NOT impressed. They're always singing in class and during lunch(not very well, either) so I thought maybe it would be better sound with actual backup music. Please, this is the Christmas season, don't buy this for your kids!"
1,THIS IS THE WORST CD EVER RECORDED!,"What the heck is this cd? It sounds like they homemade it in their garage. Their voices stink and aren't strong at all. They are too bubble gum pop like. Just look at the cover! They are all blondes wearing pink while playing in feathers. Plus, all those rap parts are horrible. They are just talking. - MeganTheir songs were so bad that we bursted out laughing on every one! if they could get a record deal so should we!!!!!!!!!!-Brandi"
1,"Wow, I thought Hilary Duff was bad!",Oh my gosh! How old are these girls? Nine?! They're voices sound like they are three! They make me want to throw up on their faces!
1,Bad,"Like I said, they're bad.You have probably read my other review. I was gonna say, people who hate Triple Image shout ""Down with Triple Image!"" People who like Triple Image shout ""I am an idiot!"" There you go. Bye, now.P.S. I don't care what you think."
1,Oh please. . .,"Oh my God, it's the Olsen twins with some other [unknown] trailing along.Just because they're young and blonde that does NOT mean that they should make records!That also does not mean that they should rip off songs from Girl Thing. Honestly! No one can do ""Last One Standing"" justice except for Michelle, Linzi, Jodi, Anika and Nikki!I have officially lost all faith in American pop music. Thank you very much, Triple Image."
1,They Can't Sing,"What do people see in this junk?They can't sing.I don't have the album.I just heard the samples on amazon.com.By that I knew this album was junk.1.Celebrate-0/5.What are they doing in this song?They're trying to rap.Well they can't rap.So ha!2.Last One Standing-1/5.Trying to rap again, eh?They're scraming.The chorus is a little bit better.3.Boy Next Door-0/5.Now they're trying to sound cute.The lyrics sound discusting.4.It's a Wake Up Call-0/5.Trying to sound cute again, eh?Again the lyrics are discusting.5.Hey Now(Girls Just Wanna Have Fun)-3/5.They sound better here.I heard a full version of the song.They try to rap at the ending (again).Chorus sucks.These girl sang better than any other songs on their album.But they screamed to sing here.OK, I'm done. Can I get on with my life, now?"
5,LOVE IT!!!,"This is awesome! I did """"None Of Your Bisueness"" for the talent show at my school and they (the adience) loved it! 5 stars"
1,The decline of western civilization is upon us.,"Of course, the word ""civilization"" is probably too complex a word for these 11 year olds to understand. Skim through these titles... what, did a toddler write these? Yes, you have a crush on this 'cute guy'. Big deal. And their voices... pre-pubescent girls singing is always highly irritating. ""I kissed a boy""... ooo! Fasinating! Was it ""the boy next door""? You dirty dirty little girl. Of course, in their defense, primary grade children don't care about intelligent song writing, which this is completly lacking."
2,Play is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better,"ok i got htis cd from planet replay for 2.50. im glad that's the only price i had to pay (besides my sanity). everyone says ""well they were only 12 and 13 on this cd"" but play was only 12 and 13 on their 1st cd and they sounded a whole lot better. mostly because they can sing. secondly they didn't dance around like a bunch of little monkeys and they had much better clothes. overall, the cd isn't totally horrible but even their new stuff sounds like crap. and if you look on their website at the pictures, i can find at least 5 play pictures that look exactly the same (except they did it 1st) if you must buy the cd, the best songs are last one standing and cool it now. otherwise buy any of the play cd's/dvd's and get more bang for your buck(and save your sanity)"
1,Oh Lordy....,"Unless you are like 10 or something, don't even bother looking at this album. How much more manufactured krap are they gonna put out there??"
2,is this a joke or what?,"Good Gravy.Most would say that I am lenient in my pop music reviews. But these girls are pretty lousy singers. They are all right at rapping, but come ON, does the world really need a group of three female Aaron Carters?I feel evil, because I look at those adorable sisters rolling around in feathers, looking so much like my own little sister, and think, ""How could I say anything bad about them?"" So I'll give them this: ""Last One Standing"" is a fun and mildly creative song...the rapping sounds more like dc Talk than Aaron Carter. It's the only song on the album that's worth listening to, unless you have a higher toleration for cheesy pop music than I do. ""The Boy Next Door"" is an absolute joke, as is ""I Kissed A Boy.""The only thing that would make me want to listen to any new Triple Image material is for the girls to sing about more mature topics, instead of repeating ""I miss you, boy"" a gazillion times. Maybe when they're older..."
3,Is this their debut album?,"If this is, it's pretty good, but in the first two songs, I actually wanted to know if they were singing or talking. I received this for a gift, and I'm keeping it to see if I like it better later, but for right now, I'd rather listen to No Secrets."
1,This is Scary!!,"What has the music industry come to?! How old are these girls any way? 10? 11? If you ask me, that is WAY too young to get a record deal. Sheesh, their music gives me headaches. It's very annoying. I could sing better then that. My friend Alexis can sing better than that. After hearing some of their songs, I felt like screaming my head off. They are even WORSE then Play or Dream Street. (And they are both real bad!) Someone come save us from these awful 10 year old pests!! They sound like four-year-olds. Did BubbleGum Pop records sign them? It sure looks like it! There are tons of other TALENTED artists out there. You should go buy their CDs instead of wasting ur money on this garbage!"
3,"some star, much dust.","i`m a 14 year old girl, just so u know that i`m a teenager:Plately i`ve become very interested in music by bands at about my age, and that`s how i heard of triple image.when i heard last one standing, i thought it was really cool. the lyrics are very much fun and so is the beat. i think i would give that song 5 stars. some of the others are pretty good, but songs like ""the boy next door"" ruins the whole thing. they keep repeating i miss you boy almost the whole song, until some guy says i miss you girl, just to make is a little more exciting (did it work? no!)i still recomand this album for all teeny bopper lovers:D it`s really sweet and makes you wanna dance:D"
4,Radio Disney is where it's at,"Not sure the ""Rich Man"" is looking in the right places for his kind of music... didn't your mom teach you to play with kids your own age... This album is cute, fun and if your the right age you will definitely agree!!! It is just what we needed, nice to have fun girls not trying to be adults for once.... We listen to their album on our way home from school every day!! We love it, even my big brother... only he doesn't like to admit it!!!"
4,Discoveries: Search for Ancient China,We are going on a travel/cruise to China in a few days and the book got us excited on our upcoming trip.
3,A Movie That Should've Been Called 'What White Women Want',"Yes, as my title states, this movie should've been called What 'White' Women Want. I think the movie is ok."
1,Too much useless jargon & outdated theoretical framework,"Rofel, a feminist herself, justifies her own subjectivity by framing her research subjects' testimonies within her politically-charged gender/modernity framework. She does not propose a coherent thesis, but merely attempts to debunk the modernity paradigm that other scholars have done decades ago. There is too much social science jargon that doesn't serve to legitimize her research but only serves to mask the inadequecies of her method and her ill-conceived theories and biased interpretations."
2,Jargon PoMo Fluff,"But lacking substance and a forcefully argued coherent thesis. Journalistic and useful ethnography, but without much substance."
2,Case studies,"It was not a bad book if in politics you like to read about one area and one factory. If you like this it is a very good book; however, I do not like this kind of politics I like the bigger picture and to get a better overall understanding of the country or even city. This book through only gave me an understanding of the dinamics of one factory and I do not think that is effective for a whole book. Another major problem with the book was that it seemed like two books that where writen at different times and then put together in other words she wrote her disertation and then whent back got some more stuff and turned it into a book withou trying to make it flow better. So I did not really like this book."
4,Best ever and easy to use,This is the best for all wood and tile floors. Easy to use and no stooping or bending. I love it and I have tried a lot of products over the years.
4,Good for wood floors,"It works well on wood floors. Not the strongest vacuum, but picks up most small pieces. I leave it plugged in. Our whole bottom floor is now wood and it lasts long enough to clean it on one charge. Perfect for crumbs and cat hair!"
5,Love this thing!,"We have a 15 month old and crumbs and food are all over our tile floors. Our Swiffer Vacuum picks up everything, even big chunks of food. So nice not to have to pull out the broom all the time. The charge doesn't last that long, but we only use it around the kitchen, so I could care less - just plug it in overnight. I gave our toddler the old Swiffer Sweeper to play with... took a section off the handle, so it is short now."
5,Super Swifter,"Love this product. This is my second one. Could not do without my Swifter, makes housekeeping so much easier. Highly recommended product."
1,Battery won't hold charge,"We purchased a SweeperVac in January 2011. We use it approximately 20 minutes a week on our wood floors. It did an ok job but I thought it was over priced when we purchased it. We've noticed the charge has been dropping off lately. This morning after being fully charged and the light green, I used the SweeperVac for all of 3 minutes before it died. For the price of this item I would expect it to last longer than 18 months. I've had a B&D Dustbuster for over 5 years and it is still going strong. We won't buy another SweeperVac."
2,Great for inbetween...,"I bought this hoping it would save me time in sweeping, well no not really. It does pretty good for the pet fur and some of the dust and dirt. If you have serious clumps of dirt forget it and even dead grass gets clogged in the end. I am still using it for the after the kids go to bed because I do have to give it that it is quiet. So as an inbetween it is good but not as the main source of sweeping. Definatly was disappointed in the commercial it showed it picking up pet food that is a NO! Won't pick up any food except the really small crumbs. Won't even pick up cat litter. So for the price if you are looking to replace your broom don't waiste your money. I wish I hadn't paid that much for it. But at the end of the day I do like going to bed with that little bit of shine back on my floor from the kids and pets running through the house."
1,Not pratical,The battery only lasts 12 minutes and it takes 18 hours to recharge it each time. How do you do cleaning with those limitations? What a useless piece of plastic.
1,Not the model # listed,"The model # listed under the Product Description is 04815. The model # I got in the mail is FS4000. I returned it. Model # FS4000 in my opinion is not nearly as good as the older model 04815. It doesn't stay charged as long, it takes longer to charge back up, and for some reason the Swiffer people moved the power button lower on the product so you have to bend over to turn it on or off. The older model had the power button on the handle up by your hand."
4,"It is a handy little ""picker-upper""","I had been wanting a Swiffer Sweeper vac for a very long time. I finally purchased one, and was very disappointed initially. Some of the other reviewers mention that the run time is ""only"" 10 or 15 minutes -- I was only getting about 2 minutes per charge, and it needed at least 18 hours to charge for that small amount each time.I took it back to the store where I purchased it, and got another one. I am happy to report that the first was just a ""lemon"", and I am satisfied with the performance now. It will pick up crumbs, cat hair and all the other little ""nasties"" of everyday life from hardwood and tile floors. I've had mine for a few months now, and the filter is still fine (I take it out and clean it after every couple of uses). I change the pad every other time as well. It is fine for light day-to-day cleaning. So glad I got a good one the second time around!"
1,Doesn't do much...,"I did not like this at all! Here are the reasons:1. It takes 18 hours to charge for less than 20 minutes of usage. If you have a house that has more than one room, it'll take you a few days just to vac the entire house.2. It barely picks up anything. I think the picture on the box is misleading. The picture shows the vac sucking up cereals, but it doesn't even pick up cat litter.3. The filter gets filled easily. You'll have to clean out the filter after 10-20 minutes of usage.I guess if you have a small apt and you're purely using it for the purpose of sucking up pet hair.. then get it. Otherwise, this is pretty much junk."
2,Disposible,"At first it works well. The charge is very slow, and the batteries are not only cheap, they cannot be replaced, or even removed for recycling. It's too bad P&G didn't make the batteries replaceable like they did with the WetJet."
1,Terrible product,"Takes all day to charge then barely holds the charge long enough to do one medium sized room. Suction is only good for a minute - sometimes seconds - before you hear the motor start to wind down and all you're left with is a duster on a stick. It ignores anything larger than a breadcrumb. Terrible product, you might as well wrap an old t-shirt round a broom - it's basically the same thing."
1,Very disappointed...,"I bought this item two days ago and I'm very, very disappointed. I was hoping to find a product to sweep the floor and a vacuum cleaner in the same time. First, I had to charge the battery for 24 hours (which is way to much for 10-12 minutes of use) then, when I start to use it I saw that the vacuum is not powerful enough and after few minutes almost stop working. When I cleaned the filter I noticed I had to breath all the dust which was stick to the filter, plus hair and all the dirt and I paid a huge price for it (I bought it in Jamaica and it was around 100 USD). When I bought it I looked on the box to see how many minutes is working and didn't see any information about it. I'm very disappointed! I wasted my money for a piece of useless plastic."
3,Was great for a while,"I've had mine for just over a year and the battery doesn't even last long enough to sweep my kitchen anymore. When I originally purchased it, I was able to sweep the kitchen, dining room, two living areas, and two bathrooms before the battery died. It worked really well at getting up cat hair (two cats) and dust but not as great with grains of cat litter and sand. I wish they would sell a battery replacement...contemplating whether I should try a different brand or just buy another one of these. The battery in this DID last longer than the Dirt Devil BroomVac I had previously...."
3,"Great while it's charged, but.....","When the swiffer is fully charged, it works like a dream. I was so impressed with the concept of the swiffer sheet + a vac + the incredible maneuverability of the swiffer. My only complaint, but a very important one, is that the battery lasts only a short time. I have a 2000 sq ft home with wood and floor tiles, and I cannot clean my floors all at once like I'd like to. I called Swiffer customer service and reported this problem. The attendant explained that this is a common complaint, and that she would relay my message to the company.I don't need the swiffer vac to be cordless. Maybe the company should think about making the vac with a permanent electric cord that can be used for uninterrupted use of the vac. I tried using the vac with the cord that comes to charge the battery to see if it would charge while I used it, but it didn't. Hope they can fix this soon."
1,Terrible battery life,"Received Jan 26, 2013 finally charged on Jan 28, 2013, lasted about 12 minutes.Was able to use again on Feb 7, 2013, battery lasted 5 minutes.Put back on charger, used again on Feb 12, 2013 and again battery lasted 5 minutes. This is terrible.Doesn't last long enough to barely clean one room and then you have to wait AT LEAST 24 hours before you can use it again. Wish I would never have spent the money for this."
1,new design is useless,"I had the older swiffer sweeper vac and LOVED IT! It eventually died-would not hold a charge, so I replaced it. The first thing I noticed was that the power button is no longer on the handle. I didn't like that change but could have gotten over it easy enough if the thing actually worked! My old version one would visibly pull things into the vacuum, crumbs, cheerios, dog hair, etc. This new one just pushed it a long and then when I am done 'vacuumming' I have to get out my real vacuum and suck up all the stuff it left behind. This is no better than a regualr swiffer without the vacuuum part! At first I thought it was just me until my Mom was complaining about her new swiffer. Same complaints. Soooo dissapointed!"
1,POOREST VACUUM EVER,"Great concept; however, this thing is a piece of crap. You get what you pay for. Poor battery life, even poorer suction. You have to change the filter every 2 minutes for it to maintain any type of suction. Sorry...very poor decision to purchase this thing. buyers beware!"
1,Battery does not last,I bought the Swiffer SweeperVac last week. I put it together and let it charge for close to 24 hrs before using it for the time. The first couple of times I used it seemed pretty good. Then the other day I unplugged it went to clean the house. My house is about 1000 sq. ft. and mostly bare floors. I got about half the house cleaned when the vacuum's battery died. As you can imagine this is very disappointing. I will be returning this as soon as I can and will be on the look out for something that will be able to clean my house without having to recharge for 15 plus hours in the middle.
2,Not worth it,"Product is okay. The duster does pretty well with picking up dust and pet hair, but the actual vacuum does not suck up larger items like dirt as easily as it claims, which was the main reason why I bought it. I also have to keep it on the charger alot as one use seems to run the charge down. I find myself going back to using my dust buster as much as I did before. Not worth the price."
1,Quality down,"I loved the vac. Noticed I put it in past tense. It would be a good vac if only the battery would last longer and it would have more suction. I have the original one that first came out. I did have an issue with the short battery life even with that one. I wanted a new one thinking maybe the new one lasted longer so I bought one from Walmart. I was shocked the quality is lower yet. The battery is very short lived, the suction seems to die out sooner. The on/ off switch used to be located on the handle where you grip it but now it is on top of the motor which is a very inconvenient spot. The rubberized tip on the handle now catches on my clothing as I move the vac. The quality went way, way down. I hope another company catches on and makes a vac with the same concept worth buying. This one is not. I'm keeping my old one until I can find another one which I hope is very soon."
3,new swiffer is improved,"There is a big improvement for charging the battery on the new Swiffer . There is an indicator light and the unit will shut off when the charge is complete. Swiffer also claims that the battery will last longer on the new one. We'll see. I wouldn't be surprised, however, that a lot of discount stores are still selling the old one so buyer beware.I love the utility of this sweeper but having to dump the whole thing when a battery goes bad is a definite drawback. I was able to recycle my old one through a local battery store, but Swiffer needs to develop a battery that can be replaced."
1,a waste of money b/c can't replace battery,"it worked ok for a while, but it's too expensive to be a replaceable gadget -- what a piece of junk!"
2,filters are hard to find,"I purchased this product about 5 months ago to keep my room clean. It IS great on crumbs and small spaces. The disposable filters are EXTREMELY hard to find in stores and it is almost never in stock in my local stores. I cant even find it here on amazon!If you want you could get use the Swiffer Sweeper wet mop cloths with it, but the vacuum part makes changing the wet mop clothes kinda awkward."
4,Swifter Sweepervac Does a Good Job Quickly,"I have had one of these before. They are great, but I wish that you could buy a new battery, rather than replacing the whole unit."
5,Great!,"I love this! Just wish it held a charge longer. It has to be charged daily.What the vac doesn't get, the ""dustmop"" behind it does...leaves no dust behind (or pet hairs). The cup is tiny and needs to be emptied often; but it's so much better than anything else I've owned that I'll be happy to buy one every year if necessary (others have said that's the rechargeable battery's lifetime) until something better comes along."
2,Wears out quickly,"Swiffer SweeperVac is a great product for a while, but it only has a lifespan of 12-18 months before it won't hold much of a charge. Mine is now down to about 4 minutes of power....which makes it pretty useless. This is the second SweeperVac that I've owned, but I hope to replace it with something more durable."
2,Poor Battery Life,"My Swiffer Vac is failing after about two years. It was reasonably good at cleaning, though never a powerful vacuum. However, the battery is deteriorating and vacuum time is down to 7 minutes from previous 13 or so. It has a weird charging system. No matter how little you use it, it won't indicate full charge until it has been charged for 19 hours. Why Swiffer can't have the usual indicator system that other battery operated appliances have is beyond me. I'm going to get another brand of kitchen vacuum to replace it."
3,Older ones are better,"This one works okay, but the neck swivels way too much. The older models were much better. The improvements, aren't. Good luck finding these somewhere else, though. I give it a cee."
1,"DON'T BUY THIS ""TOY""","I thought this was the perfect solution for the kitty litter that gets tracked all over my bathroom floor.....boy was I wrong!The vacuum function is a joke....even after s l o w multiple passes over the litter, most is still there....especially in the grout lines.I will be returning this to Amazon.Shame on Good Housekeeing for giving it your (not to meaningful) seal of approvalAnd to the reviewers here that gave this raving reviews...you are either blind or a paid reviewer!!"
1,Both my units lasted less than 2 months,"I bought 2 of these from walmart. Both batteries only hold 5 minutes of charge after 2 months. I am an Engineer so trust me when I say these are expensive considering how spotty their quality is. You can tell by the very mixed reviews. You can gamble and buy one, but don't say I did not warn you."
4,Great for stairs,"This is a great vacuum on hardwood floors, especially stairs. What the vacuum doesn't get, the swiffer cloth does. I make the cloth work twice as hard by turning it over and using the other side. Imortant to use Swiffer brand cloths as they definitely work better. If it held charge a little longer, would give it 5 stars in my book."
4,Does what it needs to do well,"Pros: inexpensive, lightweight, efficient, combines wipe pad and vacuumCons: have to charge after use, not always able to vacuum things off the floor"
4,"Easy to use, but battery runs out fast","light weight, easy to use (even for a grandma!) picks up dirt better than a mop, however the vacuum battery runs out very fast (from fully charged to out of power may be 15 mins)and it takes over 10 hours to recharge it! think twice if you have a very big house with large area of hard wood floor"
3,"Good product, short battery life","Works really great for sweeping my hard wood floor, especially with our 3 cats and all the fur they shed. I really like it. Only problem is it took 20 hours to charge and the battery lasted less than a half hour. Seems like a LOT of charging time for such short working time."
4,Big Help but,"Great tool but the vac only helps pick up light weight crud, gets those hairballs but the dry cat foods needs the heavy duty vac. Overall I'd recommend"
5,Wonderful,I was amazed of what I got of my floor after I had swept it with a broom when I used this vac. I purchased another one for my vacation home.
5,"Wow...Small, Light and Incredibly Efficient!","Wow...What a great surprise...it does small jobs on hard wood floors incredibly well...this has been one of the few ""extensions"" to the Swiffter line that has been, if you can believe it, undermarketed..."
2,Decent product but not worth the money....,"Great at pre-cleaning laminate flooring before using the Swiffer WetJet when i first got it. Initially I thought it was good buy, but after a while the charge seemed to die faster and faster. Before long the charge would die before i finished one room (my home is 80% laminate flooring). After 6 months the charger would no longer charge the Sweeper Vac. So instead of finding out whether it was the charger or the Sweeper Vac unit that went bad, decided to invest in a better hard floor vac and ditch the Swiffer Sweeper Vac. Also the replacement sweeper clothes become costly over time just like the other swiffer products. Not worth the price of $30.00 when you can get a hard floor vac for that price or a little more that is more efficient."
2,light weight.............floor cleaner,laminate floors are very difficult to get rid of dust on.....most devices just move the dust around and a portion can be swept up.Can't really use liquids due to possibility of bubbling the composite material used..The Vacuum portion of the sweeper takes care of that and it is inexpensive.
2,Swiffer Sucks?,"I had been wanting a Swiffer Vac for a long time. I finally ordered one because it was a great price on Amazon. I waited excitedly for it to come in the mail. Upon opening it, I didnt realize that it would be so small. After charging it I decided to give it a test run. Big Disappointment. Although it did a decent job, it didnt ""suck"" like I thought it would. I am glad I got it at a reduced price and not full retail."
4,Swiffer Sweeper Vac,"This is a great product, especially since I have hardwood flooring and a shedding dog. It's great that it vacuums and wipes at the same time. It is also very handy for stairs and the battery life is good. I have two, one for each floor. However, they usually only last for about a year or so. It is also difficult to find one at retail stores, forcing me to order my latest one online."
4,"works beautifully for wood floors, but doesn't stay charged long","I have wood floors throughout my entire house. This sweeper is perfect! But the charge does not last long enough to get through the entire house. If I want to keep using it, I'll have to have one for the upstairs and one for the main floor."
4,swiffer review,"The swiffer is great to have if you have wooden floors or tile. It is definitely better than a broom because with the duster and the vacuum together it is great, especially if you have animals like I do.The only negative thing I have to say is that I had one for about a year(maybe less) and it died on me and today I am replacing it. I tried living without for several months but I just couldn't, the dust is driving me crazy and the broom and dust mop just don't cut it when it comes to getting up the dust."
2,P&G is close to a great product.,"If they made three changes then this would be a perfect 5.1. Extend battery life,2. Alow you to use a wet pad, then you could mop and sweep at the same time,3. Make it quieter, so you didn't need ear protection."
4,Great Vac but READ THIS ABOUT BATTERY B4 USING:,"This IS the best Swiffer product. It vacuums almost everything but catches the dust and pet hairs with the Swiffer pad. One important piece of info you need to know before using: you must charge the battery for 24 hours before using AND any time you use it you must run the battery all the way to empty before charging again. This product evidently has a rechargeable battery with a ""memory"": it remembers where you started charging it from the last time. If you charge it with half a charge left, you'll only have half a charge from then on. If you read Swiffer's website, they warn you to do this, and the newest package info says this too. I leave mine on in a corner until it runs all the way down before charging now. Unfortunately, I didn't know this with my first Swiffer Vac. Live & learn."
4,Works great on hardwood floors,"I bought this to clean my hardwood floors and I've had excellent results. I just wish the vacum was more powerful, but still it does a good job removing the dust."
2,swiffer sweeper vac,battery life is terriblemust remain charging for over 2 days for a full chargefull charge lasts about 1 hour of continuous use - actually less than one hourthe product works though - cleans great.
5,It's like a swiffer / dust buster combo!,"This little guy is amazing!I have a small apartment with all hardwood or tile floors. This little guy does a GREAT job picking up dust, dirt, and small food bits. The charge is (as described in other reviews) small, but it's plenty to give my apartment a good sweep down once a day. It beats the heck out of sweeping!After reading the other reviews, I think it's important to note this little guy isn't going to beat out high power vacuum, but it does a much better job than a broom and is small and light weight. It's probably not for you if you have a very large home or really dirty floors."
4,Great Product,"Read all reviews. Order the product. Used the product and found that all of my dust balls, cat hair balls ( I have 2 persian cats) and that cat litter that is around the box was removed very effectively. My expensive broom is sitting in the closet. I have a 730 sq. ft apartment and found that the charge does manage about 15 mins. I do wish that the company would make a longer charge so that you would not have to wait several hours to use again. But, saying all of this I would highly recommend this product to anyone."
2,damaged goods,"i got the vac in damaged packaging - starter button at first did not work, but then started and wouldn't go off for 20 plus minutes. Then when it finally shut off, it wouldn't start again. Contacted Proctor and Gamble toll-free and they sent me a coupon for the vac to get a new one free - tried to find it but the local Wal-mart hasn't got this type of Swiffer product in yet.So far i am totally disgusted. And the last 2 books i ordered via Amazon never arived either - i got the A-Z credit on both i believe. But what's the point of ordering stuff here if i have to reorder it elsewhere? i think Amazon really needs to do more homework on some of the businesses selling by them of late, as before these last 3 transactions with various sellers, i've never had a problem.it seems Amazon is really going down the tubes and i hesitate to order from them again."
1,Swiffer SweeperVac Starter Kit,"i dislike almost everything about this machine...except for one is that the pad does what its said its does, and that's sweep & keep all dirst dust,,,but as a whole, the battery can't even last for 25 minutes, after charging for 18 hrs...18hr!?? dam...not worth it...at all!!!"
4,Review of Swiffer Sweep and Vac,"I have used this item in the past and loved it. This one, however, is defective. On the bottom of the sweeper is a flat surface on which a dust cloth is attached and next to it is plastic piece that collects the particles that are then vacuumed up. The plastic piece is not properly installed and scrapes the floor. I've been trying to work around it, but it doesn't always work.Too much trouble/money to send back. Do you usually get the defective models to sell on Amazon?"
2,P&G doesn't sell battery replacement please post a better solution,"If you feel $40.00 bucks a year, maybe 15 months, is reasonable for a floor vac (plus upkeep costs, filters, dust cloths) then you'll love this. Just buy a new one every year. It does a great job while it lasts, and I'd happily pay 1/2 price for a battery replacement, but the swiffer company (PE&G;) just wants you to keep purchasing complete units, when all you need is a replacement battery. (they're forcing us to crap up the landfills!) I say screw them--anyone else LOVE this product and managed to find an equal replacement? Please post the replacement's name here. Thanks in advance!!!!! I don't want corded, but will go that route if I have to. Again, THANKS FOR ANY ASSISTANCE!PS-- This review is a result of FIVE UNITS being purchased by myself and friends because I bragged on it so much I caused four other people to purchase it. We ALL need replacement batteries!"
2,Swiffer Sweper Vac OK - not great,"This sweeper vac is fine for some tasks, but the short battery life is a drawback. You charge it for up to 18 hours and get 12 or 13 minutes of use. It is much better than a dust buster, but the short battery life limits its use. I would recommend it as long as you are willing to use it sparingly."
3,"Good for quick clean ups, but just doesn't get the whole house.","I should start by saying that I live in a small house. This is on purpose. I used to live in a huge instahood McMansion and moved to smaller place because I discovered the extra room was an unused waste of space and I hate cleaning the extra. That said: when I first got this vacuum it would clean the entire house. Now, the battery is dead after about half of it. Basically, it runs for about 10 minutes then has to recharge for a day. (With my regular vacuum I can get my whole house in a little less than 20 minutes.) Not convenient. I still use it for a quick one room clean up, or to tackle a small mess. If I could replace the battery that would be great, but from what I've seen, that's a chore."
5,Great vac,"This is the second Swiffer Vac we own. The first one finally died on us, battery would not hold a charge. We have a 1,800 sf home and she can vac the whole house on one charge. She has to be quick though. It works really well picking up the dog hair from 3 Rat Terrier dogs we own. Only thing I would like to see is the batteries like a cordless drill so you can have on in the vac charging and one just in the charger so you have more time to vac.Other than that it is a great unit to use. Very light to move around and carry up stairs.Would recommend it for purchase."
4,"Doesn't last, but great while it does!","I bought this at Wal-Mart for about $25 and LOVED it! It is so convenient and gets up the dust that other cordless vacs don't, and it was cheap. Obviously there are probably stronger, more resilient cordless vacs out there, but u will also pay a good bit more for it - plus, like I said, they don't get the dust like this one. My only gripe is that it only lasted less than a year. The battery won't charge at all anymore and it actually began lasting less and less time for the last few months. However, for the money, it was great and for the price of another ""nicer"" one, you can afford to buy 2 or 3 of these. I am considering buying another one."
3,Battery-Life Poor,"I bought this to take the place of the Dustbuster I find myself bending down and using all the time. I charged it for 24 hours initially. Used it maybe 5 minutes in our small kitchen on Saturday. Used it in an upstairs bedroom the following day and the motor idled down and then it shut off after about 3 minutes. I guess my expectations were too high for this, but for around $40 retail price, I would expect the battery life to last longer than 8 minutes. They also included 2 Swiffer cloths. I think they could have done a little bit better on that end too with the starter kit.On the positive side, it did pick up pet hair and dust very well. When it was running . . ."
2,Doesn't pick up cat litter,"The older swiffer models are far superior than this product. The motor is pretty weak and really can't pick up anything of substance. For instance, my old swiffer could pick up kitty litter off the floor great. This product just pushes it around and won't suck any of it up.If you need a swiffer that is just a floor duster, this product is sufficient. If you need it to clean up anything more than that, forget it."
5,Swiffer Sweeper Vac,"This sweeper vac sucks.... But, that's a good thing. We have tried several different kinds of sweeper vacs and this is the one that gets the job done. If my wife likes it then I like it."
5,best for hardwood floor,"Used a few of vacuum, this one is best for wood floor.no scratch, clean. Do it all"
5,Swiffer SweeperVac - The BOMB! (In a good way),"No more dust in the air. No more whatever created on the floor after washing. Brooms just spreads all the dust and dirt around. The CLOTH w/vac makes all the difference in the world. It gets all the fine particles left behind. And how it gets the edges!!!! And the corners!!!! Don't have to move chairs it gets around the legs! It gets under pedestal tables!!! It gets behind toilets!!! WAIT I NEED TO DO A BACK FLIP! It's just a little bit of heaven on earth for me. The 'bare floor' settings on big / expensive vaccumn cleaners cannot compete with this little wonder. Oh, and did I mention the AFFORDABLE price?? I had one for over 1 1/2 years and it's still going strong. I bought another one so I have one ready to go when one runs out of juice (which it does in my house-2 dogs, 2 granddaughters, and I live in the inner inner dusty city.) I love this product."
2,Not the best for the environment or the wallet!,"Not happy with Swiffer's vac. On my second one--the first one lasted 3 months, just under Target's 90-day return policy (whew!), but I thought that was fluke. All these positive reviews can't be wrong, right? Well...I've had my second one for the about 8 months and it's already dying! This baby's had an easy job in my house. The hardwood floors are relatively clean, except for crumbs, hair, etc. Besides a short life, the problem with this stick vac is that you have to keep buying disposable wipes and filters, amounting to an on-going expense, which is wasteful both in more ways than one. Unfortunately, this didn't occur to me at the time of purchase. The pros are that it's easy to operate, fairly sturdy for its weight and does a fair job when it's new...before it starts to lose suction."
2,Does not last,"I was happy with this sweeper when I first got it, but I've had it less than a year and it's now in the trash. It's not built to last. The motor has degraded so badly that even when fully charged it's not useable. Very disappointed. My mom had the same problem with hers also."
2,Charger breaks and the whole Swiffer is unusable...,"I bought the Swiffer vacuum/wet wipe less than a year ago and the charger does not work anymore.I have written to P and G three times and I haven't gotten a replacement. Finally today, I was told I would get a coupon for a free Swiffer starter kit.. don't know if this will include the charger.Good idea, crappy parts!** - EDIT - I received the coupon for a whole replacement. The batteries in this unit do not retain charge even to sweep up my living room. I guess there are compromises to the lightweight design.. the battery is small and quite useless."
2,Swiffer Company...are you listening?,"Handy to use and seems to work fine. However, Swiffer should have used Lithium Ion batteries on this product. The battery life is unacceptable and this is due to nickel cadmium battery, which no one wants anymore. I will not buy any more cordless tools or devices that do not come with Lithium Ion batteries. Swiffer....use Lithium Ion and charge another ten bucks. I would be more than happy to pay extra knowing that the battery life will allow me to do more than my kitchen. Just my take on the matter."
5,Mother's Miracle,"I have a toddler, who loves to plant cheerios, bits of crackers, and anything else that she can get her hands on throughout the house. I always had a difficult time keeping up with her and keeping my house clean. The Swiffer Sweep'n'Vac came to the rescue. I thought this little vaccum/sweeper would be a waste of money at first, but it is continuously proven me wrong. The vac picks up everything from pet hair to broken glass flawlessly.I will admit that it can be a pain to clean out the filter; however, the few minutes taken to dump the canister and pull the dust from the filter is worth the pain saved from using a broom and dustpan. I can clean all 1500 square feet of my home in about 10 minutes and can do so about three times before having to recharge the vac!I have never had a problem with the wooden floors, which we just had installed last year, being scratched by the vaccum. I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone who asks!"
2,Not good enough,"We had the old swiffer and it worked pretty good, it would pick up virtually anything from the floor.This new on is not at all like that. It's not strong enough.If you have dust or vey light dirt on the floor, you have to pass through very slowly so it can pick it up, and sometimes it doesn't even do that consistently.Another step backwards is the on/off switch. It used to be in the handle, so with only one hand you could do the whole thing.Now is is down where the engine is, so you need to hold it with one hand and turn it on with the other. It's a minor thing, but when you can compare with the old one which was really good, then you see the difference.The concept is very good, wireless and very light, but I think they went back a step with this new model."
3,Great in the beginning...,"This item was very helpful initially on my hardwood floors and linoleum floors. It grabbed dog hair and dirt nicely if you used the swiffer vac at least once a week. But, over time it did seem to loose it's suction power and was less and less effective. I have had it for only a year and the battery has stopped keeping a charge after the first 15 seconds. I considered purchasing another one since it is a convenient way to keep the floors clean; but after I see that it's between $32-40 now I think I will have to reconsider."
3,Stars are quickly falling for this one.,I really loved this product when I first got it. Then I notice after 3 uses the suction is less. I will try to blow it out with an air compressor and I wouldn't mind putting up with 5 more lbs on this thing if they just upgraded the suction/motor.Second battery is not that great.
3,Battery life is definitely an issue,"May 2012:Over time, the battery life is definitely a problem. Following a full charge, I can't do even half a room. This is very disappointing. Not sure whether to try and purchase a new battery or revert to a dustbuster.January 2011: I was tired of having to buy a new dustbuster every three years as you can't replace the battery. I've loved my regular Swiffer for years and as my primary use is on hardwood floors in a one bedroom apartment, this seemed a viable alternative. Now that we've just used it for the first time, I'm delighted. The vacuum actions picks up crumbs exactly as a dustbuster would do and you have the added bonus of the Swiffer drycloth at the same time. Note that charging the first time took much longer than 12 hours as advertised. Can't speak to battery life as we haven't had it for long enough."
3,Well ... It IS better then a broom ...,"My girlfriend has an apartment with hardwood floors throughout and a cat who seems to shed hair like no animal I'd ever seen before. On top of the dust (it's a fairly old apartment) and the cat hair, the floor can become rather shoddy-looking pretty fast. When I found the Swiffer Vac buried in the closet, I thought I'd give THAT a try instead of sweeping all the time.As another reviewer pointed out, I can say with absolute certainty, it is DEFINITELY better and more effective then using a broom. However, not only does the battery die really quickly, but it seems to take forever to recharge! It does a halfway decent job, but for over thirty dollars, I can't give it a very enthusiastic thumbs-up. I'd probably be inclined to find another option ..."
3,"Nice, but could be better.","The sweeper vac is the best thing for people with hardwood/tile etc and who own animals. It's cordless, so it's convenient, and the swiffer pads can hold a lot of dirt on their own.However.1. The canister is small. Halfway through the house I have to empty it.2. Like most rechargable things, the batteries WILL DIE. We got a year-and-a-half of use out of our old one before it started dying in the middle of cleaning. It takes a while to recharge, as well.3. I haven't been able to clean the filter well or find filter replacements.4. It won't pick up some things, and doesn't work well in corners. (I was hoping it'd pick up the fuzz from my dogs' toys.)If Swiffer would address these concerns and produce a new model, it would be PERFECT. Even with its flaws, it's a great product. It's perfect for when unexpected company arrive; you just zip around, and it looks like you spent an hour vaccuuming. It's a must-have for anyone with wood, vinyl, laminate, or tile."
1,Not Built to Last,"I LOVED this item when I first had it. It was just what I needed: a lightweight vacuum, unencumbered by a cord, that I could run around every day and pick up cat fur and cat litter. It made it really easy to keep my floors clean. Unfortunately, over time the motor became less powerful, even when fully charged. Eventually it just died and it wouldn't recharge. I've had it less than a year, and it's dead.I'm really disappointed. I just ordered a cordless electric broom from Oreck, hoping that you get what you pay for."
1,Unhappy,"I recently purchased a Swiffer SweepVac. I noticed, after purchasing, that it needed replacement filters. I would not have purchased this if I had known this. They need to be ordered from DirtDevil, where the charge is $6.99 plus $4.00 for shipping. That is $11 for a tiny filter. I only paid $24 for the whole SweepVac. Also, I didn't realize that this product is made by DirtDevil. My experience has been that DirtDevil products never last more than 6 - 12 months. It has become quickly obvious that the real purpose of this SweepVac is to keep Proctor & Gamble and DirtDevil in business with the continuous purchase of relacement parts. At this rate, the SweepVac should have, at the very least, been given away for free. It is going back to the store."
5,Best $30.00 I have spent!,I love this item! I tell anyone I can about how great it is and I do not miss my broom and dust pan one single bit! I would buy another one in a heart beat and my husband makes fun of me for how much I praise it as I am using it. I would 100% reccommend it to anyone who feels like they are constantly sweeping their floor from all the messes our kids make. Buy this today and you won't regret it!
4,battery is only problem,"I've been a fan of this vac since it's infancy. I've always loved it and use it all the time. My only complaint is the problem with the battery. The battery doesn't last long. It lasts less and less the longer you have it and there is no such thing as a replacement battery. I'm surprise, as another woman wrote, that this product hasn't come up to the century we live in..either invent a battery that can last at least 20 minutes or invent a way to sell replacement batteries as other companies do. Despite this problem, I won't live without this in my kitchen. The days of sweeing with a broom are over. I DO have a roomba and love that too, but forget to use it on the kitchen floor!!!"
1,dead before its time,I can't evaluate how well the swiffer vac cleans up because it doesn't stay charged long enough. The green light means its fully charged. But I don't get 5 minutes out of it and its dead!
1,Wore out Too Quickly,"I bought this to tide us over while we were waiting to have our central vac repaired (and as it turned out replaced). It worked fine in the beginning, but quickly deteriorated to the point where the battery barely lasted long enough to vacuum a room. The combination of the Swiffer cloth and suction did work nicely together to pick up dust and cat hair, but it took so long to recharge that it became virtually useless in no time at all and I went back to sweeping the floors. It might be adequate for short spot cleaning, but for that a dust buster (IMHO) does a better job."
2,Great.. AT FIRST,"I bought this product a few months back as i saw it advertised and thought what a great idea, i have a big vacuum and it is awkward to use and really loud so i don't like using it on my vinyl floors (kitchen and bathroom), so i thought the swiffer vac looked really handy. When i first bought it i put it together and charged it and tried it out, it worked great, sucked up spilt cat litter in the bathroom and little dry food mess in the kitchen etc, it was great. Then a couple months on i noticed it start to lose suction, then it would only work when it was fully charged (like the instant i took it off charge and only for like 10 mins and then it would lose suction again) and now a couple months later it will hardly suck anything up, and i'm talking like some bits of dry rice etc, it wont suck it up, and some things it does suck up just fall back out again. I am very disappointed in it as it seemed like such a great product, i have emailed swiffer about it but am not expecting much."
2,Initially works very well,"2.5 StarsI've used this product for about 4 months now. I typically use it once a week to clean the floors of my room. At first, the vacuum worked very well and picked up everything that it was supposed to. However, as time goes on, you'll notice that the power of the vacuum is not as good as it needs to be to pick up dust and pet hair. It got to the point where I was basically just spreading the cat hair around under my bed instead of vacuuming it up. It doesn't matter if you follow Swiffer's instructions on how to maximize battery life and power. The battery just plain gets weaker very quickly over time. In conclusion, unless you absolutely need the portability offered by this product or if you just need to do some light vacuuming, avoid it if you can.Pros:LightweightCons:Battery lifeLimited power"
2,Doesn't last long,"I loved the swiffer when I first received it, but after only a few months it won't hold a charge. This is very frustrating when I need to clean up after the kids and dogs."
3,If only the battery lasted longer...,"I am happy with this product- except the battery life. It takes 18 hours to fully charge- and lasts for maybe 30 min.As a person in a wheelchair, I needed something lightweight that I could use to help my mom keep her store and (large) house clean. This seemed to fit the bill. It's definitely light enough for me to use, sucks up quite a bit of dirt, and then the swiffer pad gets even more dust and pet hair. However...Sometimes I have to pick it up and set the center of suction directly over a wad of pet hair, dog kibble, wadded-up gum wrapper, etc., to get the vacuum to suck up the item. The battery life is the worst part- I might get 2 rooms in the house or 1/3 of the [small] store done before the battery dies. Then it needs charged for 18 hrs.If the battery lasted longer, I could recommend this product..."
3,Needs better charge!!!,"I really like the idea of this product. It works rather well on hardwood floors. My problem is with the charge. Their website even explains how the charge works. ""You get about 8-10 minutes work of vacuuming,"" but then have to charge it for an entire day to get 8-10 minutes more...in my opinion, there needs to be a much longer battery time...Honestly, how many of us take 10 minutes to clean our floors???"
3,terrible battery life kills this product,"we've had this unit for about 7 months now and just about everything seems right with this cleaning device, the weight, the ease of use - all except for the battery life, which sucks big time and you can't do anything about it. our is not that big and on a full charge done overnight, the battery would drain before we get done with about 500 sq ft of vacuuming. i would have gladly paid $50 for this unit if the battery either last longer or is swappable for continuous use. i guess we'll have to wait for version 2, which hopefully swiffer is in the process of researching."
5,Great Machine,This is the second one of these that I have purchased; the first one lasted about seven years; great little vacuum especially if you have hardwood floors.
1,Battery dies in 6 months,"I had one of these years ago- lasted 2 years. Since then, they die within the year. Batteries are $20 to replace- so I purchased a new unit- it lasted 8 months if I was lucky. :("
1,Doesn't pick up anything!,"I got this to pick up tracked cat litter from around the house...It won't even pick up lightweight wheat/corn litter. Works better if you use it backwards and pull it toward you to get the vacuum nozzle closer to the floor...but then you can hear it scratching against the hardwood, and it's very uncomfortable to use it this way. Definitely does not pick up cheerio's like the picture on the box implies. It doesn't pick up anything..."
5,Handy Vac,"This is just a replacement for a previous Swiffer Vac. We've used them for a number of years already and are obviously sold on them. Our only ""dislike"" is they cheapened it by putting the power button on the top of the motor casing down low, rather on the top of the handle where it is much easier to use."
2,Vacuum Ineffective,"The power for the vacuum portion is very weak, does not pick up cat litter or small food items dropped by our toddler....not effective for what we purchased it for."
3,It's O.K.,I first came upon this item at a friends house where I gave her a haircut. When it came time to sweep up the hair she said get my SVac. It picked up the hair great. So I ordered one. Unfortunately I'm disappointed that it doesn't pick up sand that well. It just kind of pushes it around.
4,better than regular vacuum on wood floow,"I have two cats and living in City, with regular vacuum, I still have ton of dust and hair on the floor (do your flashlight test). Friend gave me this vacuum and used it and it passed the flashlight test with flying colors. With regular vacuum, I have go back and do moping but I don't have to do it again.There are con of this product ofcouse. First, battery last only for about 500 SF size and it takes 24 hours to charge. Second, you have to change the filter quite often. In a long run, I will end up paying more than some expense vacuum but still I recommend if you have wood floor house because it does better.Incase anyone doesn't know flashlight test, you turn off the hour light (not too dark) then you roll the flashight on the floor turned on and you lay on the floow to look at the lighted areas."
1,only LASTS 5-6 minutes after lengthy charging!!!!!!!,"HAD TO RETURN. First one wouldn't charge; SECOND purchase charged, but takes 18 hrs and worked fine in kitchen -- then it quits. Charge again for another 18 hrs and still lasts just 5-6 minutes -- just enough to do one small area @ a time. NOT WORTH THE PRICE OR THE 18 HOURS OF CHARGE, CHARGE AGAIN and again... Got refund for one; returned second n waiting for that refund."
4,Pretty decent for light duty cleaning,"The Swiffer Vac works well for cleaning up crumbs and dust in my little 500 square-foot apartment with all hardwood floors and tile. If you have a much bigger area to clean, or have carpet or pets, it might not be worth your while -- the vacuum motor won't pick up large bits, and a full charge is only good for 10-12 minutes of vacuuming, so if it takes you more than 10 minutes to cover all your surfaces, you'll have trouble. It also takes a long time to charge (16 hours or so), so you kind of need to plan ahead when you'll be cleaning (or just dedicate an outlet to it).For small-scale, infrequent use, though, it works great and is a good value."
5,Rockstar Rocks,"With vocal ranges to make you wonder how many singers there actually are, true rock rythems, a hammer like base beat, and the drumbs of war beating the music into your head. It's no wonder Rockstar was the hit of The Vans Warp Tour in San Francisco, and Tahoe last summer. Their debut album Blame it on Eve is a work of art unto itself. This is the must have album, in any collection. With songs like Kill Die, Heave Ho, Jimmy Sun, and Girl Next Door, you won't be disappointed. Watching them live is the best stage show out there. Check for show dates on their web site."
2,Love this TV. Until it didn't work anymore.,"I bought this TV from Costco. After about 3 years, the lamp stopped working. So I replaced it and i didn't mind too much - $200 every 3-4 years is not great, but ok. But then 9 months later, the new lamp stopped working. I replaced it twice only to discover that now the lamp wasn't the problem. Rather it was something much more expensive like the ballast board or the light engine. Rather get another TV."
1,problems still there Jan '06,"I got the 72"" version, great TV, incredible picture for 3 months 'till the bulb burned out. Replacement was nearly instant, installation was easy, but I guess the TV has to go back, since the warranty won't last forever. I'll check to see if they'd like to swap for a reworked version since I love the TV.As additional input, I could not get a stand for over 6 months, probably because they'd stopped production due to the flaw."
4,great 4 the money,"got a good deal on mine ,1784.00. just did,nt get the owners manual! anyone can send me a copy would be thankful. i would recomend this product over the high priced samsung plasma 57. any day of the week save the extra moneny u save 4 the game party on this excellent product. this is the first toshiba i""ve owned, but sure as hell not the last. lt. col .tate r.usmc"
1,TV and Toshiba Customer support issues,"I purchased my 62"" TV in December 2005. Within 2 months I noticed a humming noise coming from the back of the TV. I figured it was from the fans cooling the TV and didn't give it much further thought. However, the humming noise became worse over the next few months and eventually got downright annoying. I contacted a service tech who determined the problem was the color wheel going bad and it will need to be replaced for a mere thousand dollars. Thank goodness the TV is still under the manufacturer's warranty. The part was ordered from Toshiba 2 weeks ago and it is still on back order with no definate timeframe for shipping. I guess they are too busy using the parts to put together more defective sets for retailers to sell. I will have to take solace in the fact I still have a TV to watch in the meantime, right along with the extra background ""noise""."
4,Toshiba 62HM95 62-Inch Projection DLP HD-Ready TV,"I bought this TV in Jan 2006, my bulb blew out after FIVE years, this TV is used quite extensively, XBOX 360 constantly, so i would have to say i got a good one other than the bulb blowing out after 5 years."
1,Bulb life is terrible,"Bulb life is terrible---bulb life is misrepresented by the sales people, bulb price are ridiculously high,!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i will never utter the word Toshiba again--........."
1,RUN!RUN!!RUN!!! DO NOT BUY,"Bought this TV in Oct 2005....since then life has never been the same....from the lamp bulb to the engine light..I will not recommend this TV to my enemy if I have one. The Lamp cost about $200, it last for five months if you are lucky. The color wheel located inside the engine light cost $700 for replacement, it goes out every 5 months.....so Run!Run!!Run!!! do not buy this TV....If I new what I know now, I would have gone for either panasonic or samsung. Did I forget to mention the irritable noise coming from the back of the TV?"
2,Toshiba DLP's eat bulbs Like candy,"Purchased 46HM84 May 05..blew bulb April 06...just blew another today! Only wife and I at home..TV is on maybe 30 hours a week....60 would be the occasional max. I did file a complaint on the Toshiba Cust support web site. Probably will not do any good, but at least got complaint on file.."
1,worst ever,"If you own this tv and have had no problems,,, SELL IT FAST while the getting is good,since i bought this tv they changed six bulbs in the first two years,when the number seven had to be changed they said the transformer was bad thats why the bulbs went bad so often.the the color wheel was giving poor qualty picture so they came back to change that whole color tray.now the color wheel is bad again,five years im glad i got the extended warrenty on this tv to bad i couldnt get a ten year one,now ill throw this tv out and never buy toshiba products ever again clearly the are junk.they should recall them all."
2,Lamp Blew Out at 5 months,"TV picture and features are very good for the price, but the lamp blew at 5 months! Since we only use this set about 25 hours a week its only at about 500 hours or so and the lamp is rated by Toshiba for 6000-8000 hours. Customer service was typical for a large electronics company... CRAPPY & UNCARING! Laying out $250 is enough for me to say no more Toshiba... EVER!"
1,LEMON?,I loved the TV for the 2 months it worked. I purchased my 62HM95 on 1-27-06. Exactly 2 months to the day the lamp blew out. Approx: 200 hours on the bulb. Called Toshiba for a replacement bulb. They said I would receive by Friday. Called on Friday had not even been shipped. Still waiting on my replacement. Very disappointed with Toshiba customer service. BUYER BEWARE! Have read lots of reviews since purchasing the TV of people complaining of bulb going out within 2 - 3 months.
1,Toshiba 46HM95 DLP Television - BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I purchased this TV in October of 2005. The first week it had to be replaced because part of the screen went out. I received the replacemnt and bought the extended warranty. After 4 months of use the lamp blew out. After speaking with Toshiba Customer service, the part is back ordered. The best they could give me was an estimate of 2 - 3 weeks for the part to come in... then they would ship it out 2nd day shipping.After reading the other reviews, this back order problem has been an issue since atleast October of 2005 and is still not rectified. I expected alittle more out of a $2000 plus TV. My next purchase will not be a Toshiba, and if I can still return the set to the retail store I bought it, it will go back."
2,Lamp (bulb) failure,"I have the 46HM95 which is virtally the same set as the 62 just a smaller screen. Both models use the same projector bulb, D95-lmp. My lamp failed after just three months of gentle use. We only watch about 20 hours per week. Toshiba say they are out of stock of this lamp. I winder why? They say it will be 10 to 15 BUSINESS days before they send a replacement. Not good enough.While the set worked properly, the picture was superb. The best I have ever seen but I thought I would get years not month out of a lamp."
1,Very bad quality,Don't take a risk! this blank dvd got stuck in my dvd burner after first attempt to burn and i have to replace a dvd burner..i was very mad and considering to return the rest back to Amazon
1,This batch of disks did not work.,"I have previously purchased a spindle of Velocity disks and did not have any problem with burning dvds. This batch seems to be from a different vendor and does not work, period. I returned them to Amazon."
1,The worst product I have ever seen,"DVDs I bought are not working in my DVD writier (Cyberhome). I was trying to burn the videos of my one year old son, and wasted 5 dvds trying different ways. It writes all info into DVD and errors out when finishing.I tried the same thing using Sony DVD and it works just fine. Please don't buy velocity DVDs."
1,Bad,Velocity 8X 4.7 GB DVD+R (100-Pack Spindle) is bad. Cant able to burn a single DVD till now properly.
5,Interesting and Original,"Never before have I heard of the idea to combine vampires and pirates into one. It is totally fresh and original. The author has portrayed the main characters as being capable, and able to fend for themselves, though at times they do admit that they need help. He has done this so well that you can't help but cheer them on the whole way through. You can't help too, falling in love with the hero, vampirate though he may be, Lorcan Furrey, who is just the type of person you'd want around should things get bad.I could find nothing bad about this book, except for perhaps the fact that it leaves you wanting more. I just hope that Justin Somper is working on a sequel. The ending certainly leaves more to be desired."
2,Don't waste your money like I did.,"This package is really disappointing. The math programs are dismal. You click on buttons just to view a page from a math book. The Internet has interactive math websites that are far better. Unfortunately, I had to find that out after I spent my money. The earth and life sciences CD's are not too bad, but again the Internet has much to offer on these subjects for free. The history CD is a joke. The caveat here is to avoid buying these package deals and look for individual products."
2,Pay attention to the picture,"I don't exactly know how to rate this... The product is fine, I'm sure -- but the product as ordered from amazon is not.I opted for the refund vs the exchange because I don't know what I'll be sent... Part of me thinks I'd get what's expected, but a bigger part of me thinks I will again receive what is pictured: two pieces of a three-piece grommet."
2,Great tube for 2 months...then it ripped.,"With the Coleman name, I assumed that this tube would be great for the kids. We had it for 2 months and they enjoyed it. It's comfortable for 2 people, which is what it is made for. This past weekend though, we had two riders totaling no more than 200 pounds and the whole outer cover ripped off. I'll be contacting Coleman, or Amazon to see about getting this replaced. If they don't stand by their product, then I'll have wasted money and will never purchase a Coleman product again."
5,2 of the best,I bought these for my husband and he loved them. I will be buying more movies from here. We enjoy the selection
5,Energy Saving Feature,"I believe the energy saving feature refers to the fact that the blanket will automatically shut off after 3 hours, thereby saving energy should you forget to turn off the blanket when you're finished using it. I don't believe it means that the heat produced by the throw affects the room temperature or electricity use!"
2,A lazy live compilation,"I wasn't expecting much when I bought this and I got just that. Not much. It is basically a blend of two of their previous live albums, One Live Night and Live from the sun that was, in my opinion, rather haphazardly thrown together. If you already have those two albums then don't even bother getting this one as there is no new material. As far as the quality of the material itself it is pretty good though I would have like it more if they would have slipped in some songs from their Beast from the east album which is by far their best. So in summary, if you already have any of Dokken's live albums don't bother but if not then it is an okay buy..."
5,Book,Very informative book on the Gimp system. Provides a lot of information that I was unaware of and features that I wasn't familar with.
2,Sams Teach Yourself GIMP in 24 Hours.,"""Teach yourself...."" anything should start at the very beginning. This book started somewhere after the beginning.I was looking for #1, then #2 etc.Lot's n' Lot's to say about GIMP. But I didn't find the starting point of GIMP.Sadly, I've purchased Sam's Photo Facts and other books in the past. But this book does not remind me of the past books from Sam's."
4,Teach Yourself GIMP,"The product was recommended by the state department of public instruction in NC for teaching image editing. The book is fine, but it is not compatible with current versions of GIMP software."
1,Didn't work very well,"It seemed like a good idea at the time. Maybe I have a much later version than described in the book, but I found that most of the examples didn't work very well. Some were clearly broken; others did something but I couldn't quite tell what or apply the lesson to anything else.I did learn a bit, but I still can't really apply much of what I learned. Some of the things seem useful, but but until I can figure out how to get gimp to actually do them, they'll just remain a dream.I'll try something else ..."
4,Best GIMP book as of May '99,"Far more useful than the ""Artist's Guide to the GIMP"", at least for me."
3,What ever happened to editors?,"""I've heard it said many times that experience is the best teacher, and I believe that wise old saying is the absolute truth."" If you can stomach prose like this, not to mention 500 repetitions of cliches like ""cool,"" you can find some useful tutorial information in this book. As a reference, it's only so-so. Look elsewhere."
1,not useful for creating images from scratch,I wanted this book to help me step through examples of how to create images/logos from scratch. This book assumes that you already have an image that you want to modify. It also talks a lot about simple features that most people could figure out on their own.
3,Good for the Enthusiast,"Bar to Bar 2002 was pretty lack-luster. I'm a pretty hard-core fan, but the only reason I keep the discs around is to have a documentary of the season. There are parts to the 2 disc set that are absolutely and utterly stupid i.e. slide show with music.Redemption...? Clear Channel stepped it up with Bar to Bar 2003. I would give it four stars. The press conference coverage makes the difference! Seeing the SLC press conference made Bar to Bar 2003 worth every penny."
5,Last long and not greasy,Cococare Coconut Oil -- 4 fl ozBecause of Psoriasis my skin was left with out the ability to perspire or oil at all. I've used many creams and even medical creams to no avail. I have dry skin..period ! It is vey irritating ! I've learned to apply Coconut oil in an amount for me. It keeps my skin oiled with out being greasy. Irritation gone.
3,not coconut smell,i thought that because it was 100% coconut oil it would smell strongly of coconut-there is no coconut smell at all so i was disappointed about that but its still a good oil just no fragrance at all
3,OK,"""Meh"" This oil seems pretty good for hair (though I only did 1 treatment). For skin though, it seems to not absorb well, merely 'coating' dry skin. I think for the future, I'll stick to cocoa and shea butter...."
3,it works but to thin,i would go with something els would never buy again if you want something good buy the coconut oil organic
3,Weird Smell,"I use unrefined coconut oil for my hair and it helps keep it soft. I usually buy the food grade virgin coconut oil. I saw this at the beauty supply store and picked it up for its convenient size. It does melt and work like coconut oil should for the most part, but it has a slight rubbing alcohol scent to it that really bothers me, plus the color seems a bit off. I will stick with the food grade one instead."
2,No,This wasnt what I expected out the oil. When I recvd the package it was no in good shape and the oil was leaking out the package
3,Cococare Coconut Oil,"This is my first brand trying coconut oil. I use it in my thick, coarse hair. It melts easily, so I didn't need to heat it up to apply it to my hair. I think I might need to try another brand, this didn't leave my hair moisturized. It was very shiny the next day though. I also want to try an organic brand, this brand doesn't say it's organic."
4,It's a staple for me.,"This is my second time purchasing coconut oil. The first time, I paid $10 for a smaller jar then this size but the oil melted in my hand. This product doesn't easily melt in my hand but I love the price. I paid around $2 for 4.0z and it is lasting a longer than my 10$ jar. I plan to make this a staple in my hair care routine."
2,OK,"Didnt smell like coconut. VERY VERY messy, it kept leaking over everything when it melted. It wasnt as mosturizing as i expected it to be either."
5,Very Nice,I used this in my lip balm and lotion bars. It was very easy to work with and added a nice scent. I highly recommend this product
5,Miss Thang,Monica's Miss Thang is an album that started it off for this powerful singer. This album is great and fun to listen too. Glad that I was able to get it in CD form to up grade from my cassette.
3,A fun little album,"I have reconnected with this album after it spent years off of my radar and in a box. Unlike most of the albums from yesteryear, I enjoy this almost as much as I did fifteen years ago.The maturity to the songs can be a bit jarring when one notes Monica's age at the time. Part of the reason for this is that she delivers with an assurance and strength well beyond her years. One thing that stood out to me now more than it did a decade and a half ago are the not so coy sexual references and innuendos. Not that I have a problem with that, but it does catch one's attention. If I can make recommendations I would pick: Like This and Like That, Angel, and Never Can Say Goodbye. This is worth a listen. Strangely, Monica's voice seems less appealing now than it did on this album and its follow up The Boy is Mine. Some of the strength doesn't comes through as much but, here, it is in full force."
5,My girl!,Love Monica so I needed to purchase old cds i didn't have or needed to replace. Came in good condition and on time.
2,okay,"i was hyped up when i bought this album , but after listening to a few songs i couldnt wait for it to be over. monica has some good hits, but her voice is monotone. i dislike beyonce but she doesnt even sound the same all the time. not recommanded unless youre a big monica fan."
4,I just loved your CD.,"Your CD is the boom. In many of the songs it just really expressed my feeling for examples one song is #14. Oh, I can't forget #5--me and my friend were jamming off of that one. 'Don't take it Personal' was use by a lot of the girls at school at the time. Well, I just wanted to give you some props of you CD and keep it up.Just a fan, Demetrice"
4,hip-hop soul in its purest form,"just like mj's whats the 411,miss thang consists of R&B over over hip-hop beats,for its time it was fresh and interesting,all the singles on here is good.definatley has a real mid 90's vibe to it."
3,Delectable slow jams are worth listening,"For a recording by an artist whose presumed target audience was teens, Miss Thang was a surprisingly mature souding album. The hip-hop sounds heard throughout were so prevalent back in mid-90s that made a lot of the cuts rather forgettable, but on the other hand the slow jams (e.g., ""With You,"" ""Before You Walk Out Of My Life,"" and ""Now I'm Gone"") were so deeply emotional and sung with such an unwavering voice that you must wonder Monica was still a low teen when this album was released. Spin this one if you are a generation Xer who wishes to reminisce on your bitter-sweet days as a young adult in 90s."
3,SOLID,"I bought this album the same year it was released because of the song WHY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. This album growed on me after a while and even though I liked it, I felt that most of the songs were a little to mature for her only being fourteen at the time. The lyrics were so grown up and Dallas Austin did a good job producing this album. Monica has a unique voice; which has matured over the years and she will be one of those female artist that will be around for a long time. GO MONICA."
4,Gypsie Travelers are a real problem!,"I have read this book after dating a Scottish Traveler. He told me about the book, after he told me about himself and his ""life"" and family. Why I could not fit in his world, and he could not fit in mine. Having heard first hand from one of ""them"", I can truly say the author of this book has done a very accurate job in describing this clan of people! It is an interesting story of these people and how they ""survive"", by scaming people, as well as, (sometimes) hard work. Not all of these Gypsie Travelers are ALL bad.... but they are GREAT talkers and the more one knows of ""them"" the better!!!!!!! His name is Jimmy Gordon, he never stole anything from me... EXCEPT my heart... for though I no longer know his whereabouts, I sill love him. He does have dirty hands, but his heart is clean. Home is where the heart is, and Jimmy, you can always come home....."
1,"Gypsies, again...","Well, if you can't blame anyone else, blame the Gypsies. Dennis Marlock is doing very well probably, using Gypsies as his career enhancer. However, replace Gypsies with Jews, Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, and you would have a libel lawsuit on your hands. Dennis, keep talking about Gypsies, and you true racism continues to show through."
1,Hmmmmm......,"Wouldn't this be hate literature if you replaced the word ""Gypsy"" with ""Black"" or ""Jew""? Or is it okay to disparage an entire race as long as we can all agree on which one?Just curious."
3,"Okay, but has some problems","First, this item was in the box and ready to go. The assembly was well organized. I only had to tighten the skirt and install the wheel.Did not last very long. The hand holder that really supprts the trimmer was poorly designed and while tighteneing the holder, I managed to pull the bolt/nut all the way through! It may have been missing a washer that should have been installed at the factory. No worry, they sent me a new handle. Working well.Not so fast. You need a degree in Engineering to get the string to wrap around the spool. Remember this trimmer does have two strings and does cut nice. It just seems to be a maintainable nightmare. The only saving grace is that I do not have to mix gas and oil nor provide a space for a battery charger."
3,First impressions,"This trimmer is almost ready to go out of the box. It is powerful and easy to switch from horizontal to vertical trimming.However, once the initial string runs out, things get more difficult. My small, female hands had to enlist the aid of a neighbor to get the spool off the trimmer in order to replace the string. Better not throw out the directions on how to rewind the string! One has to measure the string and rewind very carefully and the spool is very small. Doing this often is going to be difficult, I fear.Also, the wheel that guides the vertial trimming falls off easily."
4,Fast & Strong,This is definitely a robust machine that makes short work of edging and trimming. It is aso powerful enough that care should be taken to wear protective gear including footware that will protect the ankles as this little jewel will turn any small loose objects it is passed over into high speed projectiles.The only drawback is the rapid demise of the light .065 diameter line used if any solid objects come into contact with the line.
2,Troy Bilt discontinued best model TB50,"I have to share the sentiments of the other reviewer chastising Troy Bilt for discontinuing their best model (and best electric corded trimmer by any company as stated by Consumer Reports), the TB50. The TB50 had the motor build into the handle at the top so that the end with the rotor was much lighter and not clunky at all. The handle still remained light and no bigger than this model's. It was similar to a gas model except it weighed less, had easier handling and blew away the competition. These models like 41ACT45P966 have a clunky, heavy rotor area at the end which makes it difficult to hold up and see what you're doing. Why Troy Bilt discontinued the TB50 is beyond reason. They also only sold it online and never carried it in stores... Now they seem to have replaced it with a battery powered model which costs more than 3 times the TB50."
2,disappointing - cheap for a reason,"The wheel attachment broke on first use. The spool for line is small and doesn't hold much line so had to stop almost every other time I used it and respool more line. The spool broke within one season of normal use and parts do not appear to be available to replace the spool assembly in total, and the cost of the parts that are available are almost as much as the original cost of the unit. The only thing I really loved about the unit is how easy it is to convert from trimming to edging with the push of one button on the trigger assembly and knob adjust on the grip."
2,Shame Shame Shame,"Shame Shame Shame, Shame on you Troy-Bilt for discontinuing the TB50 Electric string trimmer, It Is obvious that you don't care about Anyone but yourself! For absolutely NO reason you discontinued the TB50 and don't feed Me that lie, ""They were not selling! The TB50 was the only Electric string trimmer that could run the metal blades without burning up the Motor In Oklahoma humid tick Infested jungle. And don't give Me that, ""Get a gas powered one! Do they come with a Electric starter? A Person could drop dead In Oklahoma humidity trying to start a gas powered trimmer. Around here keeping the weeds down Is not matter of looking like the Jones It Is a matter of Not getting a tick transmitted disease...."
3,Great Coffee - Poor Electronics,"Never had an automatic machine like this before, I was used to the standard Mr. Coffee drip coffee maker. I am now spoiled. However, I did send it back and actually upgraded to the Gran Dama as I was not happy with the electronic board on the front of this machine. After the machine was left on for a 1/2 hour or more some of the push button commands did not work properly or some not at all. They worked fine upon on first turning on the machine. Not sure what was causing this but I decided to send it back and order the Gran Dama to see if it had the same problem. Glad to say the Gran Dama is working fantastic and I am enjoying making coffee more than I ever have before. I gave it 3 stars because of the mechanical problems."
3,Enjoy a break,"I love it.I usually drink a cappuccino 3-5 times a day.It supplys good coffee every day.But I have one concern.When I use this machine, it works with a big noise.Sometimes I think it has something to break."
2,When it works...,"We had our Gran Dama for a very happy 6 months, the coffee was excellent, our friends dutifully impressed and then one day the coffee came out noticeably slower. We followed the de-scale instructions and de-scaled (twice) and then... no change. Right now I have a $1200 ornament and according to Delonghi it is ""a scale issue"" and we need to do it again - seems unlikely. When it works it works well but I would not buy another one."
1,No Quality -- 2 machines both don't work,"I purchased my first machine, the pump did not work. I returned it.I replaced it with a new machine, figuring it was a fluke. Second machine just arrived, different issue but it does not work.I am done with DeLonghi"
2,worst customer service ever,"I just want to say that I absolutely love this machine and that is why it is so hard to write this review. I give the machine and the coffee it produces ***** but the review is so low due to the service I have recieved. I bought this machine about a year ago and became addicted to it. Great coffee, however the machine began grinding all of the beans at one time so I had to start only putting in enough beans for one cup of coffee (not how its supposed to work). I sent it in with the ""White glove service"" and have been trying to find out what's happening with my machine for over a month, im actually finally on the phone with a supervisor at Delonghi right now (finally) and once again ""he will personally look into it and get back to me"". Do yourself a favor and don't buy from this company, the great coffee is not worth the headache if it needs to be sent in for service."
3,O Ring problems,"We have had a high end expresso machine for almost 10 years now. First a couple Saecos then a couple DeLonghis. Overall, they have been comparable and we've been happy with them. But the o-rings on the DeLonghi have needed to be replaced quite often as they break or are too worn that we get nothing but foam - and we're mocha drinkers so NO foam is a priority, At first, we could buy the O-rings quite inexpensively. It was the shipping cost(domestic) that was the larger expense. So we would always order several at at time. Now, for 6 O-rings plus shipping, Delonghi is charging over $49! The last time we replaced all three. 2 broke within 5 days - and there was no wear. It was almost like the had been cut.....I'm thinking they were defective. Terrible for the cost! I can't believe they are charging this price for something that wears and breaks so often! Not happy with DeLonghi at all!"
5,Love This!!,I have already saved tons of money (sorry Starbucks)! Best purchase I've made in years!! I highly recommend this coffee maker.
2,Not hot,"The automatic features are great, however the brewed temperature is only 160 degrees with the steamed milk at 140 degrees as confirmed by De Longhi customer service. This is simply not hot enough to enjoy. I returned the item and decided that before going with another I'll call the customer service line in order to get all of the information before ordering."
1,Did not meet expectations,"I thought this machine would be extra easy because of the way it steams and foams the milk. However, the milk consistently came out luke warm at best and I would have to heat it in the microwave to get it hot. There is no wand to steam the milk to your desired temperature, so you are dependent upon the auto feature. I also noticed that the flavor of the coffee was not as good as with other machines. I took mine back and purchased another Saeco machine which was a big improvement."
2,"WTF, Logo??","Talk about thoughtless capitalism. They take the logo and colors and thoughtlessly stick it on gym bag. Then they put the product on Amazon under the wrong name. The name of the university is ""West Virginia University."" NOT ""University of West Virginia.""I dare you to walk up to someone from OSU and say, ""I really like the 'University of Ohio State!!'""Get your act together, logo. Other than that, the bag is fine."
3,Good for Fizik saddles,Two simple light modes: blinking or constant. Fits securely under the Fizik saddle and although slim has decent visibility and brightness.
3,"Really useful if own a Fizik saddle, but the light not so good","I chose this rear light because seemed really practique, just attach it, to my fizik saddle, and it really is, but the light, is not that good, really weak light"
3,Flip Flops,"These flip flops look good but are not all that comfortable, maybe it's because I'm not as young as I use to be."
3,Big but questionable durability,"This is a huge toy, which is basically why you pay the huge price. The only two concerns I have are: durability and trailer attachment. As soon as it came out of the box, the trailer kept detaching from the rig. This has been frustrating to the little boy who received this gift. The parents continue to put it back together but it just snaps apart very easily. Second, durability is questionable because the plastic is rather flimpsy. It was not as solid as I would expect for the price.Overall, it looks great and is a hit for little boys, however I think they should have made it with a thicker plastic."
1,"A total disappointment, a worthless book",After trying to teach Access to my students with this badly written book I had to give up. I must agree with other reviewers. The book does not come close to explaning the very basics of database management in the right order of ideas. Too bad that Microsoft does not care to review their books before they go to press.
2,too slow,"the book literally goes step by step for even the most simple task. It takes too long to learn even the most basic thing. Furthermore, the book is very procedure oriented. In other words, you learn to accomplish a very specific task without learning how to handle your own need."
2,Total Disappointment,Please dont bother buying this book if you are an entry level Access user. The books goes round and round in circles about one database created for a company and does not come even close to explaining the basics of database management.A total disappointment.
4,Using Access 2000 Practically,"Having taught courses on Access starting with its 1995 release, I was pleased to see a book that allowed the complete novice something to work with and use to get Access to perform. Whether you understand databases, or are completely new to database construction, this book will help get you where you want to go. It should be supplemented with another book if you plan to ""master"" Access. For the beginner to intermediate, however, this book is fantastic."
1,No Thanks!,Take this book Back! That's waht I think. I have taught myself many programs including flash & excell from books but this book stinks! I am a novice to access and learned nothing on how to create anything from scratch. All this showed me is how to use an existing database. Well that does me no good since i can't figure out how to make my own! Time to find a better book!
4,Really good cd,"Man, if you like new orleans rap, then this is the cd for you. Lady red is one of the only female rappers from the N.O that is worth listening to. She spits tight lyrics and knows how to put it down, this is a good cd to listen to, or just chill and smoke a blunt to."
4,"mary hartman, mary hartman",This series is FINALLY available and it got to me in perfect condition and very quickly.
5,What's with the cast listing,"I love MH MH and have waited a long time for this to become available. Interestingly, the cast listing lists neither Louise Lasser or Dody Goodman. What's up with that????"
5,Grateful to See this Show!,"I was only 15 when this show aired. My best friend and I covertly watched on my 13"" TV in my room. My mother would have freaked! Although it is very tame now, by 70's standards it was not. I only got to see sporadic episodes, but have always wanted to see it in its entirety. I am so happy to see it come out on DVD, that I am willing to overlook the imperfections reviewers have covered. My only regret was that once I finished the DVD's I wanted more and I can't get them!! Who knows when we'll ever see subsequent seasons?Louise Lasser is great as the deadpan, sexually frustrated housewife. She is surrounded by a quirky and funny set of characters. A favorite, her country western singer friend, Loretta. So nice to see Mary Kay Place again. A fine collection for those wanting to see Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman once again."
3,mary hartman mary hartman - volume 1,"It was enjoyable - brought lots of memories flooding back, but I think that it was much funnier when I was a big pot head back in the 70's. If you are looking for a few good smiles and even a few good laughs, then I would recommend it to all current or former pot heads that grew up when this show first came out. Will definitely say that,""This show was way before its time!!""; and I would probably buy volume 2 when it becomes available."
5,When the hell is the whole series going on DVD,"Easily the most brilliant parody of middle American life and ""values"" in history. It's criminal that the whole series has been unavailable for nearly forty years now.Unfortunately this volume ends when the series finally clicked and most of the subplots were taking shape. The great moment when she cracks up on the David Susskind show is on youtube. I'd also love to see Loretta on the Dinah Shore Show (with the real Dinah Shore) when her reference to the crew as Christ-killing Jews sends her toppling to the bottom again."
4,Nostalgia from the 1970's,Nostalgia from the 70's for those that can appreciate dry humor and satire of the soap opera genre. Louise Lasser displays wit and dead pan laughs that was not seen in television of that day. The ensemble of characters is worth watching in their often bizarre plots and twists. Worth buying if only to be seen once and saved.
2,Great show - sorry it's out on Sony though!,"I absolutely love this show, however, because the is on Sony DVD your player may not play it. My multiregional player from Target for $29.99 would not play these discs and I had to return them. Sony has these discs encoded with RCE (regional coding enhancements). They want you to buy one of their players or a regional DVD player to be able to play them. It's no wonder Sony is doing so badly. They want to be so proprietary. I had to return mine, and sadly to say, I will buy no more DVD's from Sony."
3,Funnier in '74,How times have changed. This was a lot more transgressive and funnier in 1974. It's good to see it on DVD anyway.
2,Stupid,"dumb sitcom no wonder it didn't make it on TV, they want ten more words dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb"
3,Weird and non funny,"I have seen 4 episodes thus far and have not been impressed. I have not laughed once. Such an odd program, perhaps better during its time."
2,"""MARY"" DID NOT AGE WELL","I remembered this series as hilarious, but what was funny back then falls flat as a pancake. I could barely muster a chuckle during the entire CD. I wish I could say it was worth it, but it most certainly is not worth buying or sitting through. And I LOVE comedy. A real disappointment."
2,"If you have fond memories of this show, keep them - don't buy this DVD","What was groundbreaking three decades ago (discussion of erectile disfunction, VD, and a teenage girl with cramps) seems pretty tame today. The show has not aged well. We can now see just how low its production values always were. It is seldom funny. The storylines plod along. The dialog makes the characters all sound mildly retarded. And the ""acting"" would make the cast at a smalltown dinner theater cringe. I remember loving this show when it was new. I wish this DVD had not come along to tarnish that memory. (And Martin Mull is nowhere to be found.)"
1,TRULY PATHETIC TELEVISION SERIES!,THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST BORING AND 'DRY' COMEDIES THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN! IT WAS DEFINETELY NOT FOR MY TASTE!A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!
5,Seeing stars sony_we want more vols_quick,"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman is what you watch if you want to know what happened to those who grew up in the 70's. Great Show!Just as entertaining now as it was then.Sony! Give us all you got."
4,Old School,I bought this because I remembered my mom screaming laughing at it while on tv. I wanted to see what the fuss was all about. I have been enjoying it.
5,Mary Hartman Mary Hartman,"I've always liked this show, but they never show it on TV. Its always the same old re-runs on Nick at Night or TV Land, so I decided it was time to purchase this for my permanent collection. So, I'm please I ordered this and that Amazon had it and I got it rather quickly."
5,"MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN",I loved the first 25 episodes and look forward to purchasing more as soon as it becomes available.What a riot!
5,Mary Hartman strikes again,"Having seen the orignal series I expected that much of the humor would fall flat on a second, many years later, viewing but I was dead wrong. It was still as hilarious and touching as I remembered it. Mary and her ""troubles"" were well worth and second and third look. The writing was (and is) still a brilliant parody."
2,Includes fallacious reasoning--the risk premium DOES matter,"The concept that an investment classes past performance relieves one of consideration of the significant risk premium involved in common stocks is unbelievable to me. One should not throw the risk premium out with the bathwater based on a bull market that is, at bottom, an anomaly and wants correction."
5,Buy it now! For a fine keepsake of the internet boom!,"With the title alone causing histerics, placing this on your coffee table will elicit your guests to share their best .com horror story.How they invested their $100,000 second mortage in Cisco Systems @$80 after reading it, waiting for it to become $500 (as predicted in this very book) only to see it dive to $17.How another friend invested all their cash in Etoys after reading in Sept 99, when Etoys was $60 ... wishing now that they got their shares in rolls of soft two ply.I mean, just the thought of this book, gives me the chuckles. But it now before its just a memory!"
1,In the immortal words of Homer Simpson,"DOH!!! Though now easily excused as drivel and nonsense, this book needs to be acknowledged as having had alot of influence on Republican policy makers during the Bush years. The whole underlying basis for Bushonomics was ever-increasing stock prices.Social Security privatization, huge tax cuts, and other Bush objectives worked only under the scenarios of the DOW 36,000 paradigm. Paul Krugman in his book ""The Great Unraveling"" gives appropriate attribution to this book as a force behind neocon economic policy.This book is a monument to supply-side thinking and hopeless optimism and ultimately delusion. A lesson for all to contemplate and remind oneself of the next time the grumpy old men of the Republican revolution seek to affect economic policy in the future."
1,Hahahahaha,"Dow 36,000. Hahahahahahahahahaha. ::slaps knees:: Hahahahahahahahahaha. That's a good one. Dow 36,000. Haha. And to think that once upon a time this thesis was taken seriously. Hahahahahaha. Haha. Heh. ::wipes tears from eyes::"
1,Hasset - Advisor to John McCain!!!,"Too bad you can't give negative stars! These guys are NOT economists, they are hacks. The don't work at regular colleges, publish in peer reviewed journals, or even do math. They work at Hack Joints like the cato institute or american enterprise institute, kock bros funded. Do not invest a dime based on these folks advice. Funniest thing is that John McCain paid one of these guys to be an advisor to him on economics. I hope Johnny boy did not invest his wife's money based on this, if he did, Megan would be pissed."
4,This Isn't Your Granddad's Financial World,"I have been a financial consultant for the last 20 years, and this book makes a very sound case for new valuation measures. Only a fool would ignore the power of equity investing (long term) vs. bonds. The masses are now comfortable with stock ownership and no longer move in and out of the markets on a whim.There will be fewer non-believers in about 3 years no doubt!"
2,Circular Arguing,"I must confess I purchased this book for one sole reason, to refute it. So take my opinon for what it's worth. This book is flawed from the start and is not good investment advice for the average reader. It is a great book to read if you are looking for amusement with todays market and the attitude surrounding it. I'd just like to point out to the authors that the dow would hit 36,000 tomorrow if Berkshire Hathaway was added to the industrial average. See it's not that difficult and it only took me one paragraph."
1,Absurd,"James Glassman should apologize for his stupidity, his arrogance, and this book, which lured in a whole lot of amateur investors just as the stock market was about to go bust."
1,"hahah - Market Crashing and nowhere near 36,000.",Talk about hindsight. This book should be a collectors item for it's laughable prediction. Hilarious stuff. The only thing funnier is one of the author's is Mcain's ecnomic advidor. ho ho he he
1,waiting .....,"As an addendum to my previous review, where I wrote that one reason I got out of the market was this book, let me add that before I get back into the market I'm waiting for ""Dow 36"" by Glassman and Hassett."
1,The Title Has One Too Many Zeroes,"What a strange place to find a typo misprint! But overall, surely this book is too pessimistic. Times may be hard, but it doesn't seem likely that the Dow will really fall as low as 3,600. If it doesn't, that will surely be the time to buy! Great comedy, anyhow."
1,Second only to Blodget and the South Sea Bubble,"Glassman. What a maroon. At the height of the market bubble, Glassman tells people that stocks should be 3 times higher because everyone in investing history is an idiot and Glassman is the only one who knows what stocks should really be worth.This guy is a disgrace."
1,Just How Wrong Could They Be?,"Lop off the three zeroes and you have the combined economics IQ of the authors. You'd be hard-pressed to find a more glaring example of market charlatanry (other than the daily stream of ""experts"" paraded through news shows of course). The real irony is that they published this sorry book AFTER the bubble had begun to burst in 2000."
1,Not even wrong,"People who claim that stocks are overvalued are typically assaulted for presuming to know better than the thousands of intelligent investors who make up the market. How ironic then that these two superbulls maintain not only that they know better than todays investors, but that all past investors have been fools as well for not grasping the simple truths laid out in this book. Respected economists have shredded this book for its garbled logic; I on the other hand would merely like to offer anyone who buys into their thesis all of my future earnings, for a mere 100 times my present annual salary. What a bargain!"
2,some good advice but one major faulty assumption,"The authors totally ignore the risk factor in investing. Treasury bonds are as close to an iron-clad investment as one can get. Stocks are much riskier. Therefore stocks return more. The stock market will continue to rise, but to expect a sudden tripling as a majority of investors suddenly say to themselves ""Whoa, how stupid we've been!"" is nonsensical."
1,"WhatEVER, dude!","The authors of this book were celebrities in the late '90s. At one time, they were hotter than Brittney Spears. I remember their appearance on CNN Moneyline, full of triumphalist American capitalist arrogance and swagger, boasting of their greatness and the greatness of their economy.Nice work, fellas!"
1,"Hard to make it out there in the ""Real World""....","I can see why Glassman went back to his old job at the Wash. Post. It's hard to sell dribble like this, once reality sets in. Anyone wanting a really good laugh should read this nonsense NOW... as they watch their 401-k melt away before their eyes. I'm wondering if Glassman ever researched the Dutch Tulip frenzy? ""Undervalued stocks..."" ?? Well, maybe yes....after the DOW flirts with 5,000, and the NAZ re-visits 600...15 years hence. Let's see if we can start up a really GOOD winter fire in our fireplaces with ""DOW 36,000"" kindling!"
1,At 37 cents this book still costs too much,"This is the bible of the Republican party, excess, greed and stupid making -- the stock market will go up and up and up and up and the party will never stop! Glad i gots money and you don't. suck that poor people and by the way, you don't get health care either. funny now the geniuses that wrote this drivel will head up the george bush ""think tank"" -- hard to think when you brain is made out of avocado (not to tarnish avocados, i love them). I hope they lost all their money!"
1,saw the author Glassman interviewed on TV book review show,He couldn't answer questions like who was Dow & who was Jones. If I read a book I would assume the author had done his homework (like read A History of Wall Street at least).
1,Misconstrued,"The genesis of this book was some excellent and thorough research work done by Dr. Jeremy Siegel, Professor of Finance, at the Wharton Business School (see: ""Stocks for the Long Run"").Unfortunately, the authors misinterpret Professor Siegel's findings throughout the book. Moreover, their conclusions are based on fatal (yet simplistic) flaws of corporate finance and mathematics.Reading the book, it was, at times, hard to believe that one of the authors has a Phd in Economics...."
1,"If I could rate it less than zero, I would...","These authors should be permanently placed on your list of ""people who have very clearly proven that they have absolutely, positively no idea what they're talking about."""
1,This book should be required reading for all high school students,"Why? Because then they would know how it is to be fooled once and maybe then they won't be fooled twice.Unbelievable drivel.Reality bites, I guess."
1,Hassett is one of John McCain's 'economic advisors',"McCain says he's not ""well versed"" as far as the U.S. economy is concerned. With Kevin Hassett as one of McCain's economic advisors, we now have some clue as to why that is.Dow 36,000? ROCK ON! LOL!"
1,Investing for the Naive,"The basic premise here is that stocks are being revalued as a riskless bond based on the discounted present value of expected future cash flows. Irrational Exuberance is far too reserved to describe this naive concept. Totally ignored is the fact that bondholders have first priority to assets in bankruptcy proceedings. And 500 years of a risk premium for stocks cannot be discarded like so many pampers. So much for riskless. And the investment advice here is for novices as well, ignoring the time delays when stocks are recommended in books instead of electronic media. This title is a prescription to attempt to sell a lot of books. Dow 36,000? Talk to me at the next recession."
1,Republican Economic Philosophies = GARBAGE,"Author Kevin Hassett is a ""scholar"" at the ultra-conservative American Enterprise Institute, and in ""Dow 36,000"" presents a perfect argument for investing in the supply-side and trickle-down economic philosophies pushed for almost thirty years by the Republican Party.Unfortunately, these philosophies are abject failures. Never worked and never will. These are the same people that want Americans to ""invest"" their Social Security in the stock market. What's the Dow at today...down about 40% this year...and heading off a cliff?This book is useful only if you keep it in your bathroom and run out of toilet paper."
1,Missed the mark.,"Math applied illogically, produces unreliable results. That is the case here. You know the old joke, there are three kinds of people in the world, those who can count and those who cannot.It is mostly incorrect to say that everyone who buys shares in the market today is an investor. Many, even those who think of themselves as long-term holders of stock, are speculators. That is so because as individuals, they have not done ""due diligence"", but have relied on the advice of pundits, gurus or their own gut.So, to use mathematics as a predictive tool in a way that depends on the future behavior of such speculators, is a poor application of a powerful and useful tool.One day the Dow will be at 36,000....let us hope that on the day the intrinsic value of the Dow is near 36,000 also. In real estate its ""location, location, location"". In investing its ""intrinsic value, intrinsic value, intrinsic value""."
1,I Haven't Seen These Guys on Any Financial Chat Shows Lately,"Maybe it's because they are aware of the guilt they should be feeling for hyping a stock market that was already wildly overvalued at the time they were hyping it. People who relied on these guys and put significant amounts of money in the over-inflated stock market are feeling serious pain.It will be a long time indeed before the Dow hits 36,000."
5,"Real Rock, from Detroit","I recently discovered this album and was blown away. Lead singer Wendy Case has an iconic voice, and the guitars rock without sounding over-produced. Why is Vampire Weekend more famous than The Paybacks? I don't know, but The Paybacks are much better than a lot of other bands out there."
3,I liked it,"Not really distinctive, but okay. The details were good while the overall plot was predictable. Much better than Dive From Claussen's Pier in terms of a family melodrama."
2,midwestern fiction,"Greywolf Press has become known the past few years for publishing the same bland literature over and over again, the kind of literature that doesn't upset its midwestern readership. This novel fits right in to a list that couldn't be blander."
1,This is not a writer,"This is a person using writing for therapy. It is obvious that she has experienced some trauma in her life and is writing to come to grips with her past. I have read so many wonderful books that are first novels and in these there is so much talent and imagination and good writing. Not so in Ms Treadway's first attempt. Perhaps she can improve, but she first needs to learn what good writing really is."
2,i COULD put this book down,...and did. it's predictable and boring. a novel anyone could have written.
1,Pleeeeease,"Looks like all of the author's friends from Massachusetts have written in to boost up this pale, boring book. Graywolf has made reputation for publishing some of the most middlebrow fiction in America! This one fits right in. If you want to be unchallened when you read, and bored to death to boot, then I suppose I recommend this book."
1,hard to justify,"Treadway's a writer with a distinctive voice and deft eye for detail. However, she lamely and shamefully transposes a real life tragedy from Bethlehem, NY in 1982. Call it lazy writing as well; she changes the name of the town but retains so many actual place names and school details from Bethlehem that you have to wonder why she didn't just opt for a Jon Krakauer sort of non-fiction account instead. As for the adaptation of the actual murder-suicide, Treadway takes huge liberties. In short, her novel reads like a sensationalized episode of Law and Order, ""ripped from the headlines."" For those who lived in the town and knew the family (I was a classmate of the girl who was murdered by her deranged father), this so-called ""novel"" offers no peace; it prompts disgust."
4,Sonata for memory and grief,"Jessica Treadway is clearly a writer fascinated by the complexity of the human experience, and in this case -- where a father murders his daughter and then kills himself -- an incomprehensible and shattering loss. Told brilliantly from the point of view of one of the two surviving daughters, the novel is engrossing, moving and deeply insightful. If you want to learn how to write about shock and grief, you would do well to study how Treadway does. If you're suffering shock and grief, you will find truth here and the comfort of knowing you're not alone."
5,For those seeking spiritual enlightenment,This is an excellent dvd for those seeking spiritual enlightenment.It's not meant for the materialistic bound audience.If you find this dvd unappealing you're just blind as a bat.
5,You'll need two copies...,"I wish this book had been around when I was a management consultant! This handy guide gives the straight dope on where to stay, where to eat, where to plug in the laptop and the cell phone charger, and where to kill a few hours stuck in the airport -- for all of the most important business destinations (and aircraft configurations!) across the country. Keep a copy in your briefcase and one on your assistant's desk!"
1,Less than ZERO,"There are some authors who are funny. Unfortunately newcomer Kylie Adams is not one of them. The author adeptly manages to insult just about every group, Jews, Episcopalians, Italians, southern folks, obese people, etc. You name it! As I recently read somewhere, there is nothing like humor that falls flat. The stupid, insipid, brainless, buffoonery in Fly Me To The Moon (which is where I wished I was instead of reading this book)is exactly that."
4,Enjoyable though implausible,"""Fly Me to the Moon"" is a light, humorous read as the author delivers one witty remark after another. Strong lead characters and equally delightful supporting characters. The dialogue is fresh and enjoyable-the various quips and retorts exchanged by the different characters are a delight to read.Plot-wise though, the novel fluctuates between alternating degrees of predictability and implausibility. In the romance vein, for the most part, the future love matches are so obvious that one will definitely not be surprised by the author's attempt to give everyone a happy ending (and let's face it, we like it better that way anyway). In the other aspects of the plot, however, certain developments or elements were simply too improbable and unlikely to have occurred.Basically, this novel is an extremely fun read-just go along with Kylie Adams' flight of fantasy."
1,"really,,this is a no star,,,would win the 2001 wallbanger!","this is a seriously sad first effort and misquided attempt at a romance. as a reader i am offended by both the publisher and author that this book is even offered.stereotypes run the gammit in this book,,the love scenes are crass,,and i love erotic love scenes,,these were just crass,,the humor,,well i never did understand airhead humor,,,it just doesn't work for me.i give this book a complete wallbanger F. i really feel bad for this author,,she is completely out of touch with romance readers."
4,The first and the best...,"What can you say about the first trail journal on the first solo thru-hike (not counting Myron Avery)? Earl Shaffer is a legend and rightly fully so.It is interesting to read... especially when you see what troubles he had... and especially the fact that the trail was not as well marked as it is today.I will be planning my own thru-hike soon - and hope to write (but probably not publish) a journal as half as good as Earl's.My only complaint - and a minor one at that - is that the book ends with Kathadin. I would have liked to read about his adjustment back to ""civilization"" after the hike."
3,It's okay,I got about half way through this book and have decided that I've had enough. Not very well written especially after reading Bill Bryson.
4,An eye opener,"An easy to read book that was a real eye-opener in regards to the early conditions on the trail. For those of us who have hiked the trail in modern times, it is surprising to read the author's recollection of the many people he ran into who lived in close proximity to the trail and had never even heard of it! This book is a quick read and offers interesting insights concerning self-reliance and self-discovery."
5,Essential Read for any U.S. Citizen,"This book is a high-minded discussion of our right and duty as citizens to voice our opinions, and of the ways in which we might oppose those aspects of our government and laws that we firmly reject.It belongs on the bookshelf of every American home, and should be required reading in every high school (mandatory) civics class."
5,An Novel That Has Not Received The Fame It Deserves!!,"I first read this book two years ago, and it changed the way I look at things around me. I can't describe the plot, because it really cannot be described. Read the first page, you're hooked."
1,VERY POOR,"I Tutor at a boys school and have used most of Encore's Products.Math is taught interactively so nothing but a complex program could do it... and they (there's 2 or 3) cost thousands and are for schools.Where can you go?.... If you pretty much know what you are doing and need to drill there is value in the MOST RECENT edition of THE PRINCETON REVIEW's ""MATH LIBRARY""To get value out of it, however you need to religiously use the ""teach step-by step"" mode which is activated ny a button at the bottom of the problem... Then Princeton walks you through each step in the problem.The present product,by Encore is nothing but a textbook screened on a PC... if you get a problem wrong they don't even tell you why.Try Princeton or Boxer Math's new untried product.Also CAUTION... Comptons Math are the same as Encore... (maybe that's where the name came from... ""encore""?"
2,Lacking information,"I am a sophmore college student who bought this software thinking it would give me a little help with home study. As soon as I started the program I couldn't find certain topics that were in my algebra book. The topics the software had were only summaries. This software should claim ""along with pre-algebra, there is a brief introduction to algebra, pre-cal, calculus and trig."" You would only know it was a short intro if you were or had already taken these classes. Otherwise you wouldn't know what you missing.Don't be fooled. Know going into this you will not get much out of it."
1,Software bugs - no support - lame,"I'm running Windows XP with 1GB of RAM. When I try to run the product I get an error message that says, """"This program requires at least 3MB of free virtual memory to run."" I can forgive mistakes made by software companies; however, I expect good support and fixes available ASAP. This is not the case. Companies that don't buck up on support or fix their bugs don't deserver your hard-earned dollars. Buy another math product from another company."
1,"Sounds good, but content is lacking","I bought both Math and Science for my kids. As a masters educated professional I found Science to be extremely poor and Math only slightly beter. Don't even bother for college level courses. If you need help, talk to your teacher. He or she is in a much better position to point you toward resources that are best suited for you."
4,Nice earphone,"I bought that for collection,checked that and found that it is working properly. Sound quality is pretty. Good stuff."
4,Nice Quality Headphones.,"These AKG headphones are a good buy. Their quality is much better then most in the same price range. The have a well balanced sound between the lows, mids and highs. They provide very natural sound reproduction which allows you to clearly hear the detail in the music. I have found other headphones in this price range to be lacking in bass or highs and also poor at producing the detail in the music. I would recommend these headphones to someone looking for above average sound in this price range."
2,Slightly ridiculous in places,"I really can't say I enjoyed this book much, and finished it more in the name of morbid fascination than general interest. Its a promising subject matter that could have been interesting, but instead was dealt with in a slightly ridiculous and melodramatic way which left no room for character development or further exploration of the key ideas. It would have been nice if the writer had gone deeper into Sam and his East-West conflict, or the real reasons behind Tracy's obsession with exoticism. Yes, there were points where I wanted to know what would happen next but I was mainly counting the pages to the end, where things turn out to sadly resemble a made-for-video matinee film."
1,"Bad, bad book","The English Harem started out well - Tracy seeing Literary figures in her supermarket customers was delightful, but that proved to be the only highlight of this disaster. I am always astounded by writers who manage to personify the opposite gender well, making their characters completely believable, but this author is hopeless. One wonders if he knows any women at all. Remember, he is supposed to be writing about Western women agreeing to be part of a harem (where the second wife is taking on the man who accidentally killed the love of her life!!) -really, what is their motivation to do this? The book is a long, drawn-out male fantasy, with glaring inaccuracies about Islam as well. It is a bad straight-to-video movie of a book; the author needs to get out more, meet some real people and some real muslims."
5,Nice Move,"I have to watch this movie over again to make sure i see it right, but it's very good. thx"
3,GE 20-Amp circuit braker,Does what it supposed to do but plastic is a very poor quality. Gave it three stars only because it works as designed.
3,Not Bad,"The music is alright, however, 5 or 6 recordings made in l945 are all better. There are six or seven people who are in the picture, but not mentioned in the comments. Most of the songs were recorded by an earlier band or later. I can give you the names of all of the musicians in the picture if you should want. Incidently, this picture was from a short made at Universal Studios in June or July, 1945. If you should consider another CD, please record the songs made in 1945 by all of the musicians in the picture. If you do know the names of the records cut in 1945, I can also supply you with the names. Thanks for letting me write the comments."
3,definitely not pats best,"i'm mo is definitely the best song on here every part of it is good. i bet if they waited 2 years like they did between the first two albums it wouldve definitely been as good as mista don't play cuz it had the potential, all HCP albums do. I don't think it worth the regular price but if ur a member get it if u feelin Project Pat that much. But Pat is the most nationwide memphis solo rapper so props 2 him i'm out."
3,Not his best,Layin the smackdown is definintly not his best cd. Some of the songs are boring and just not true to pats true sound. The best song on his cd is 90 days.
5,Another great album from pat,Eventhough this album isn't better than his last three it's still an exceptional piece of work. I really enjoyed this album a lot because the beats were amazing and pat's flow is as always great and every song I enjoyed and I think only three 6 fans will fully appreciate this album. For all the people who didn't like this album I think you passed judgement too fast without even listening to it all.
5,ANOTHER PLATINUM HIT!,"HYPNOTIZE MINDZ IS DA ONLY SOUTHERN RAP LABEL I LISTEN TO RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE THE OTHERS LIKE NO LIMIT AND CASH MONEY CHANGED UP THEIR BEATS. I MEAN THEY TRY TO SOUND TO MILLENIUM, BUT WHEN U'RE TALKIN' 'BOUT HCP, THEY KEEP IT REAL WITH THEIR BEATS. ANYWAYZ TALKIN' 'BOUT DIS CD I GOT IT DA DAY IT RELEASED AND IT IS OFF THE HOOK! ALL AROUND TIGHT BEATZ DAT FLOW WITH PAT'S LYRIKZ & THIS IS EQUALLY AS GOOD TO MISTA DON'T PLAY. MY FAVORITE TRACKS R: CHOOSE U, STILL RIDIN' CLEAN, MAKE DAT AZZ KLAP, 90 DAYZ, SHUT U'RE MOUTH, & TAKE DA CHARGE.P.S. WHEN IS UNBREAKABLE COMIN' OUT?"
2,The WORST Project Pat album i ever heard.,"I've been a 3-6mafia fan since day 1. I got every single album they came out with. And this Project Pat is the worst. I bought this album, and all on the sameday,,brand spanking new - after skipping around the tracks and then listened to the 3 or 4 good songs out of it,,i tossed it to the side and really haven't bumped it ever since. The beats and bass for a car system are still tight,,but it doesn't hype me up. The song (County Jail) sounds like something i used to freestyle back in 2nd grade. If u guys wanna hear a good project pat album,, buy GettyGreen. It's almost a masterpiece..that one gets 4 stars from me, and 'til this day i be bumping that on my stereo and even if i get tired of it,,i literally want to listen to it again on another day. Mista dont play its aiight..not better than getty green. But if u didn't like Mista dont Play,,,don't even bother buying this album,,cause u're gonna be mad for wasting your money on it...like i did."
4,"Still making cheese, ridin clean...","This is the first PP cd i bought. So goin backwards in order like i did, I have to say that the beats on this one are a lot more northern audience friendly. Thas prolly why these knuckleheads here are hatin. Its a great cd! Front to back, and you get a bonus cd. nahmean?It doesnt get 5 stars because i only give that to perfect cds. Check my list for that."
4,Pretty Good,This is not his best cd but still good.my fav tracks are still ridin clean and posse song.I really give this 4.5.
4,Good album,"This Project Pat album was good but not as good as Mista Don't Play. Basically that same Project Pat/Three 6 sound on this album, nuttin changed. Dope beats and lyrics once again. Project Pat once again does not disappoint.TOP TRACKS:Still Ridin CleanFightPosse SongMake Dat Azz Clap"
3,LISTEN TO THIS ON ALL LEVELS AND YOULL.... UNDASTOOD,Im a Huge Hypnotize Minds fan. Project got 3 stars on this one from me. At first I listened to it and I was like........ come on Pat ya slippin dog. Like Mista Don't Play this Cd's got a few Anthems to roll out on like Weak Ni***Z a straight up classic on this LP. Thing about Pat is hes real .... His lyrics are real.... He went through possibly the roughest year of his career during the production of this album and you can hear this in the songs. This aint no polished Let it Burn Usher crap this is that triple 6 sippin sizzzzzzyrp swords with a few nursery rhymes for the kids so they stop trippin in the back seat when ya rollin up So Pat gets 3 not 5 like ghetty or Mista but i give em 3 he'll be back at us with another 5 believe that. Cash ya Checks... and buy this LP with it and sip on DAT DRANK. Peace
4,A must-buy for the thinking person,"I would strongly recommend getting all of Chomsky's lectures on CD from AK press. I'll be the first to admit that there's a lot of simplistic rhetoric and general idiocy on the American Left (such as it is) but Chomsky is the antidode for that. You cannot seriously discuss American history, politics, or foreign affairs without coming to terms with Chomsky. The man is the modern Socrates; the soft-spoken gadfly that the State has tried to silence.TNWoT is a discussion about the nature and uses of ""terrorism"" both State-sponsored and otherwise. Really, pick up a used copy and listen to it with a critical and open mind. It may be the best $8.00 you ever spend.Recommended."
1,Review,"Very competent academic comunicator... but certainly only looking at these complex problems from one perspective, far left, and any honest comunicator, never mind educator should at least try to gain understanding from more than one perspective."
2,"""Chim Chim"" ain't where it's at","I agree when it comes to evaluating this Fishbone album that it's their worst release compared to everything else they've done. But it honestly doesn't bother me because I know I'll always have all the Fishbone albums that I love (like the magnificent ""Truth & Soul"") to go back to. So what if I don't like ""Chim Chim""?! Plenty of other people out there do. It's true that the quality of ""Chim Chim"" is on par with that of an unmixed demo or fan-made bootleg, so be extremely careful if you're looking for the same high-quality gloss found on ""Truth"" and ""Reality of My Surroundings"", because ""Chim Chim"" ain't where it's at.2.5 stars out of 5"
4,This book was really cool,"I liked this book, because it was pure horror, but it was different from 'the usual.' The stories really get going right away and you can't stop reading. I'll never look at the priest the same way again."
5,This little book has kick,"Good things come in small packages! This volume may be slender, but it packs a helluva wallop. This book is pure ""rock & roll"" hororr!"
5,their unique jazz sound but with more melody,"For the longest time my Lounge Lizard collection was limited to ""Queen. . ."" and a live album from Berlin (which is also very good).then I stumbled onto this beauty which I believe came out after ""Queen. . ."" Anyways, the Lizards meandering, sometimes discordant sound is still there, but now the melodies are stronger and seem almost more fleshed out. ""Tarantella"" is great and reminds me of the humor of ""Yak"".This is a great album to put in and be taken away with, another great trip for any escape artist."
3,Good for the price.,"This is good for the extremely cheap price. However, I wouldn't reccomend it for those of you looking for a very reliable one, though."
1,Substituting words changes the origonal meaning,"""The problem with the TNIV is that it mistranslates and changes the meanings of hundreds of passages for the simple goal of removing a lot of the male-oriented language that's in the original Greek text,"" - Randy Stinson, president of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, the group that is spearheading objections to the TNIV."
1,Will appeal to no one but church haters,No one who regularly attends church will find this radical rewriting of the bible to fit the agenda of the left of any use whatsoever. Those who hate the church will love seeing how one of the world's largest Bible translators caved in to a complete rewrite of the Bible. Will they attend church? Nope. They will just demand greater and greater editing of the bible until it resembles something the godless leftists can digest without any need to change their lives.
1,"First episode was good, but...","the second episode was lame. No suspense despite us all knowing it's all made up. The producers could learn a lot from History's Mysteries, which is way better."
4,i liked.,"Emily the Imaginary Friend / The Lost Girl- for me is a great show- girl death , no face , with unsolved soul questions , this is ""not"" impossible , if you find someone like this, make a pray for this people, they need help!- children with dead friends, this is ""not"" impossible , this is not the first movie/series with this, think ...."
1,Free Fall,"Regretfully this CD is doomed by its repetitiveness that suggests to me misdirection or lack of artistic understanding necessary to make it interesting and appealingly varied. It is one loop after another and another which, after a minute or so becomes deadly boring unfortunately. As a musician I have committed this error myself and know the pitfalls of ""loops"" if they are used at too great a length or lack variation. I wish H.I.A. well and hope that their next album is better conceptualized."
2,Not a fan,Book was not what I expected. Thought from the description that it would have more information then it did. Not a fan of this author and will avoid this author.
1,Physics of the Soul,"English is obviously not the native language of Mr.Goswami. There is no flow to his writings. He also has a knack of making simple concepts seem complicated. Although there is good content and direction in his book, the considerable energy needed to complete it, may make it not worth the effort. This book is best suited for a retired person with unending time and patience, and a knack for converting Sanskrit into English."
5,Banish your fear of Death!,"Physics of the Soul: The Quantum Book of Living, Dying, Reincarnation and Immortality by Amit Goswami was for me a look at the possibility that life continues on. I am a believer in God, so what was I worried about? Because not much is said about our state of existence in the scriptures, except for resurrection, then heaven. But where is heaven, our personality? Our soul. If there is no such thing as communicating with the deceased, then why do we as Christian profess the ""communion with Saints""? I got a clear picture of some of these things in Mr. Goswami's book. By the way you will want to read all of his books!"
4,Physics of the Soul,"Physics of the Soul: The Quantum Book of Living, Dying, Reincarnation and ImmortalityI think it is a very good work by one of the scientists who appeared on the What The Bleep movies. I do think that the title - Physics of the Soul - is a bit ambitious. It implies a rigorous scientific investigation of the soul and how it work. The truth is more much eastern religion, some science. Having said that - it is interesting easy to read, informative and educational. Just not all that scientific."
1,How to Eat Out in Germany,"I found this book of little use during our recent trip to Germany. Most of the menu items I looked up were not in the book. The organization of the book is confusing. Foods are listed by region and country but there is little definition of the regions to figure out where you might look. I tried to find menu words in the ""dictionary"" but has very little luck.We went to Paris two years ago and borrowed a book on French menu interpretation which was very helpful. It included translation of spice names, cooking methods and other information to help figure out what we were ordering. I found that book very helpful. Unfortunately, ""How to Eat Out in Germany"" is nearly the opposite."
4,Biometric works quite well,"This works quite well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is a tad awkward to use and you can only enroll one person. Having the finger print reader on a ""leash"" is a great idea, but a longer leash would be even better. Especially for laptop USB ports on the back of the machine.The enrolling limitation can be overcome somewhat if you enroll different people as different digits. Would be better if you could enroll some number of ""users,"" though."
1,This little biometric drive doesn't even work.,I thought I'd get this little biometric drive and it would plug in like every other USB and work. Well it hasn't worked from day 1. I've tried it in several different computers but it doesn't do anything. Can't see it and it's been too long since I bought it to return it.
2,Don't buy if you use Vista,"I love this device because it offers security software and it requires a finger print to access the security software. It is great to save those many logins/passwords/personalstuff that many people cannot remember. But, when I purchased a new computer that came with vista the cruzer profile would not work. I just got off the phone with SanDisk and they told me that it is not compatible with vista and she said that she does not believe that any updates will be released any time soon to fix this problem. This is crap! Do not buy this product if you run windows vista."
2,More Vista woes...,"I should have read the current reviews of this product more closely. I understand that it can function with Vista after being set up on XP. Yeah, well, for those of us who have jumped whole heartedly onto the Vista bandwagon, I am unfortunately returning this item. I do not even have access to an XP machine to set it up. I will be glad when more companies make Vista friendly devices."
4,Excellent Service,"The biometric usb flash drive, came as promised. I deducted one star, because the biometric driver is not yet available for Windows Vista."
2,Warning- This dirve may malfunction,"I have been Using this device for about 7 months since i replaced my Sandisk Titanium 1gb that i had lost. I am concerned about data protection so i purchased this drive. Last week the drive mysteriously began acting up. sometimes it would not show up when i plugged it into a usb slot. other times the light would flash for about 10 seconds then disappear. I removed everything from the drive at that point. within two days the Drive had completely malfunctioned and i am currently unable to access it on any computer.This drive is useful, just make sure you have everything backed up on your central computer."
2,Great when new then trouble later on,I bought a couple of these approximately 8 months ago. I needed a way to securely store important network information etc. on a jump drive and have it available on location.My main conern was the longevity of these units. I was worried about the two piece construction with the cable between them. My concerns have been justified. We are having problem with the cable connection on the units and must jiggle the pieces around because the connection is intermittent. The two piece contsruction with the cable between is clumsy design and I expected more from SanDisk.
1,Ultimate Fail!,"The ultimate mandoline is an ultimate failure in design. The ""safety"" feature makes this unit utterly useless. The problem is due to the fact that the mandoline slider has to be attached to the base at all times while using the blades. As the slider passes over the blade, it pushes down 2 spring loaded levers on each side of the blade. This raises the blade for cutting, but lowers it flush to the base when exposed. Due to this design, all items for slicing must fit inside the hole at the top of the slider which is far too small for most items. In other words, unless you are slicing cherry tomatoes, pearl onions, or other very small foods, you must first cut the it into smaller chunks. I do not recommend this item at all."
1,"A sad little ""Safety"" cutter","I was hopful, but found the safety feature of this mandolin made it nearly useless. I wanted to make french fries, but everthing has to fit it the little oval hole. Anyone want 2 inch fries with their burger? It's also hard to get the last of the item you are slicing sliced. I think you have to unprong it and hold the handle just right."
1,Worthless,"As others have said, the item to be cut must fit in a little hole about 2""x3"", and even then the holder won't let you push down enough to cut the last 1"" or so of thickness.This is one of those items you'd give zero stars to if Amazon permitted. And we got it free! Imagine if you'd paid for this turkey."
1,So safe it is useless.,"We have had this mandoline for over a year and have never been able to slice on it. After reading the reviews here we now know why. You HAVE to use the food holder to make the blade come up. So much for slicing tomatoes, onions, potatoes. These items do not fit in the holder. Even if you could get something sliced in it you only get 2 thicknesses."
2,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with this purchase! I wanted it to slice veggies like zucchini to grill or fry up and this slices them too thin. Haven't tried it on anything else yet, went back to old slicer I've had for years and have ordered another Mandoline to try it."
1,"Think twice before ordering, it's dangerous!","The first time I used this thing, I was in the ER a half hour later. If not for my thumbnail and the angle which I sliced myself, I would be missing a huge chunk out of my thumb too, luckily they were able to stitch the end of my thumb back on. This thing is just too dangerous to have in the house."
1,junk,"Please, please, please, save your money! The vee blade bent, the straight blade flexes and the holder is unsafe. Keep away; you've been warned."
1,I Wish I Could Give This No Stars,"I have loved every item ever purchased from Pampered Chef until I bought this. I tried slicing potatoes thinly for chips, and after fighting with the mandoline for an hour, I gave up. It required a significant amount of effort, and a precise application of pressure, to get the potato to slice uniformly. I have never been more frustrated, I gave up and used a knife.I do have to say that when I contacted Pampered Chef, they were very gracious, and allowed me to return this for a full refund - they even issued a call tag to pick it up. I'm impressed, I was expecting (at best) a merchandise credit.Pampered Chef is a great company with gadgets that I love (their garlic press, for example, is the best I've ever used), this particular product does not live up to the Pampered Chef name or reputation."
1,P.O.S.,"I have been trying to use this for a year now. Different items and such. It's crap. In fact I am finding that most Pampered Chef gadgets are all crap. The mandoline doesn't even slice. I have tried cucumbers, potatoes and tomatoes. The only thing it's even remotely useful at is shredding cheese. Seems like a lot of work for shredding cheese though when I can just pull out my trusty old stand up generic grater. Epic Fail!"
1,Don't waste your money,"The safety feature won't let you slice your fingers, but it also makes it almost impossible to slice your veggies!"
4,I like it,"There's a little steeper learning curve to this product than I had expected (I probably shouldn't have used it the first time for Thanksgiving dinner, needing to cut potatoes and apples). However, once I had watched a video review so I understood that you need to get the food carrier right up to the top of the mandoline so the safety levers will disengage, it was fairly easy to use. I haven't tried tomatoes or other veggies yet, but I'm looking forward to using it again. If I were to do it again, I'd use it before the day I needed it so I could call my Pampered Chef consultant. But I really like the safety features and the fact that it's ALL DISHWASHER SAFE!!!"
1,Dangerous,"Tried to use it with big onion, did not fit. Slipped with guard and ended up with stitches! Try to find an old model!"
1,"Should be sold as a ""paperweight""",This thing is worthless. I guess it could be sold as a paperweight since that is all it is good for. We tried all the different blades and none of them would cut anything worth a darn. There is no way this thing was tested prior to marketing. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
5,Great cutter for apples,"I bought the mandoline at half price & love it for slicing apples to dry. I have not experimented with any other foods yet but the safety feature worked well for me, I did need to cut the apples in half to fit in the hole although it was not much extra work. It slices uniformly so they dry evenly. Love it & can't wait to try other foods, I hear they are coming out with a larger feeder attachment which will hopefully be large enough to slice whole tomatoes/potatoes/onions, etc. I did get a personal lesson from the consultant & that may have helped in my ease of use."
1,Sliced my finger in half,Not sure what it was supposed to do but upon my first usage with this Mandoline I managed to slice my finger from the tip to the knuckle clean through...After several stitches & cauterizing I will be visiting the surgeon tomorrow...Never have I encountered such a dangerous item.....Yes my spelling is off no I am not stupid & yes I'm typing with a bandaged index finger...Just letting people wishing to purchase this to be warned it is not as simple azs it is made out to be & should be used with extra care...Professionals only perhaps...It is now in the trash thanks to my other half....
2,Big Playstation Fan,"As a huge fan of the first Playstation I waited with antisapation realise of PS2. Sorry to say it, but I was dissapointed. I really expected more for this kind of money.Graphics are good, but not great. You can enjoy same graphics by buying Dreamcast for fraction of the cost.Playstation2 is great if you like paying for such stuff as motorized cd track! Playstation1 had a cover which you had to push to close. The problem was that after a few month of using it you had to push about dozen times to close it. So, I guess they decided to switch to motorized tray, making us pay for it. I wonder how much is it going to last on the floor of your living room. Lets face it consoles should be design to take a little more abuse than laptops or PCs. If you decide to buy ps2, make sure to buy such Playstation classic as Twisted Metal 2 and new Twisted Metal Black."
5,Book Review by Echoed Voices Magazine,"Artist and Author Karri Ann Allrich has enriched us all with,""A Witches Book of Dreams.""For anyone, who has ever feared or questioned a dream, this is the book for you. I have never seen a book with such an extensive ""Dream Dictionary"" in it as this one.Karri enlightens the reader with easy to read samples and explanations. She doesn't dictate with her book but instead encourages the reader to open up their mind, awaken their spirit and think for themselves, to decipher their own dreams in their own way.Once this is accomplished, the answers are all there. She brings the wisdom of Jung, and the spiritual of Goddess. With this combination you couldn't go wrong.Karri Allrich has filled the void in the pagan market with subject matter and viewpoint. For all who dream, ""A Witches Book of Dreams"" is a must have!"
4,IFL Greatest Hits of Season 1,This DVD has clips from 35 different fights from season 1. It does a nice job of explaining the teams and rules. I have never watched it on TV so I bought the dvd and it was easy to follow. It does feature several well known UFC fighters. I think its worth the $15.00 I paid for it.
1,Do not leave the package at the front door,Your carrier Laseship left my package at the front door and is missing now.How can I complain this situation?And how can I get back my stuff?This is very disappointing.
1,Long awaited....and disappointed,"The first time I heard Alex Bugnon was in the fall of 1996. He played at an outside concert that my ex boss hired for all his employess to enjoy. Alex was fabulous! I went out and purchased everything I could find. I have waited a long time for this new release only to be very disappointed. Very bland. So bland , that I sold it to a used CD store for $2.50."
4,Book club selection,"It was well-written and I enjoyed the ""voice"" of Namu. I found it interesting to learn about the unique culture of this isolated place. Our book club had fastinating discussion about the various aspects of a matrelineal way of life. We also enjoyed the dynamics between grandmother, mother and daughter. There were many side stories to explore as well. Since I am a dog lover I thought the story about the dogs giving up their 60 year life span for the human 13 year life span was heart warming!"
1,"A Scattered Collection of Songs, Misses the Mark","Tonight is My time for reviewing ""Millenium Best of's"" from Family Acts (see Debarge, Jets), This One is an abject failure on many fronts: Who chose these Songs?! Some are Good, but why Three Marie Solo Tunes and None from Donny? Where is ""A little bit Country"", ""On the Shelf"", ""Aint nothing like the real thing"", and others? This 12 Song format should have worked well for this Duo (although they could certainly fill a 20 Song Best of respectfully), yet it's completely botched, Haphazard; Stupid Collection that insults those that Appreciate Donny and Marie, Avoid this untill the Record Companies get it right..."
3,"Lots of gems, but some songs are missing.","This collection includes four actual Donny and Marie hits plus some great album tracks like ""One of These Days"" and the haunting ""Living on My Suspicion."" These two tracks alone make the CD worth buying. But where are the other hits like ""On the Shelf,"" ""Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing,"" ""A Little Bit Country"" and ""You're My Soul and Inspiration""? Also, three Marie Osmond songs are included on the end of the CD. Doesn't she deserve a separate CD collection like brother Donny? Still, this collection (along with 1993's Greatest Hits) does offer some classic gems. Great sound quality too."
5,I saw this book yesterday at a cook books store in Burbank.,"I have two books by Pol Martin and he is the best, I was surprise to see that his books are out of print thru Amazon.com."
4,Good devotional,I got this book for my grandmother because she raised me after my teen mother passed when I was 17 months old. She likes it a lot and is a very religious woman but it doesn't have enough direct scripture...
3,Cant really rate this item yet!,"I ordered this way back when ! Before Christmas is when I ordered it , it is still not here yet !! Wow, taking a long time, i emailed the people in question , they said it comes from over the Seas, so it takes longer , wow, i would not have ordered it if i know that ! Oh well, I will wait & try to be patient ,"
5,amazing,"their 8th album, yet still fresh. They are constantly finding something new, while remaining true to their own sound, which varies widely, reminding me in turns of Weezer, Nirvana and Oasis and even the Beatles. Don't like one of those bands? Listen to the next song, it'll be something different.Strangely, they are not well known even in Japan, but they should be known everywhere"
5,mmmmm,"disclaimer first: lindt is the chocolate brand i like, not milka. in theory.in practice, i love 2 milka products.no 1 is this chocolate: i am CRAZY about it!caramel is actually liquid and although this is not exactly ""FILLED chocolate"", they weren't goin cheap on just how much caramel filling they spritzed in it.to make a long story short, if you love caramel, you will LOVE this chocolate."
1,dribble dribble,"Magic Johnson is a great athlete, but as a rapper he's flabby and uncoordinated. This cut just ain't ""workin'"" for us real folk who know what's what in rap. Magic, you don' know nuthin' 'bout life in the hood, so go back to playin' your silly little ball games and bangin' hot little cheerleaders and leave the rappin' to authentic gangstas like P. Diddy and Tad Yamamoto."
5,Beyond words,"During a rough time in my life (A broken Heart), I heard the song ""Walking her home"" on the radio and it brought me to tears. This was my first Christian CD I bought and now that is the only genre music I listen to. I can honestly say this CD saved and changed my life."
4,Mark Scultz is the BEST Christian music artist out there!!!,"Okay, I am a CD fanatic,so let's just say I preview LOT'S of CD's all the time just for fun, and to see which one's I want to purchase. This man is the BEST Christian artist out there!! The thing that appeals to me about Mark the most I have to say, is the way he writes his songs. Some Christian singers (and other types of recording artists, too) have a knack for singing about things that either don't make a whole lot of sense, or that just don't strike anyone very emotionally. Mark is different. I was just discussing his music with my mom the other day, and we were both in agreement about how it's his simplicity...his genuine feelings for those who have gone through pain, joy etc. that makes him different. He writes about REAL LIFE HAPPENINGS! No one will be disappointed in buying any or all of his Cd's (like I have!). :)"
5,great story,"This book is the bestIt starts out with henry Ford to edison, With real fact Based DataVery little opinion I would recommend This for someone That wants toGet the Whole story From the beginning , I was surprised to read aboutelectric cars in the early 1900s."
4,Absolutely fascinating...,"Although I haven't finished Internal Combustion quite yet, I'm finding it a lot of fun to read.It's a great history lesson, and Black does a great job backing up every claim. This book will definitely excite you and piss you off at the same time, as you'll see how the little man and great American innovation is/has been fun to watch, while corporations and the individuals that are businessmen first, and innovators second, have done much to put us in the hole we're in today."
5,This book is a fascinating thriller!,"All summer long I saw stories about gas prices and automobile troubles on a daily basis in the newspapers and on television. This left me troubled and frustrated about the problem that lied ahead for my generation. After reading Internal Combustion, this issue suddenly made sense. From a historical context, the events that led us up to our current chaos were deeply illustrated and it felt like I was a part of the story. Never before have I read such a thoroughly researched, intimately developed and page-turning thriller. I recommend this book to anyone to better understand the complex world that we live in, grasp the dynamics of this debate and grab the key's to our own future. This book has helped me do all of that and I am thankful to Edwin black for writing the story of our time. I promise you won't regret buying it for yourself!"
3,"Great stuff, but terribly overpriced","I've got relatively sensitive skin on my face. Most sunscreens will cause it to break out. This is one of the only brands that doesn't. Shame they gouge so much for it in comparison to other brands. That and it's pity it's not available in larger sizes. But it works well, and until I find another solution it's the one I'll continue to use for my face (only)."
3,"First on the subject, rough around the edges","This is the first text book published on H.264. It has a nice overview of digital video compression techniques followed by chapters focusing on the specifics of each of the MPEG-4 and H.264 standards. Buying this book relays much of the same information but is more cost effective than buying each of the papers and articles on the subject from IEEE and others.It appears that this book was rushed to publication in order to be first. Particularly in the chapter on H.264, there are many typos and incomplete figures. In some places, a new technical term is used without proper introduction. I look forward to a cleaner second edition in the future."
1,Pretty useless,"The book does not go deep into the H.264 standard.It seems that it was supposed to be a review of MPEG-4, with H.264 added as an afterthought.I expected the level of the Mitchell / Pennebaker classic book on MPEG, but was disappointed."
3,A book which is better than many overview papers,"I like the book on overview of H.264 (because it is no worse than most of overview papers, even those in IEEE by H.264 chairs)."
3,disappointed,"I have every book that Jill Gregory has written. I absolutely loved 'Rough Wrangler, Tender Kisses' and 'Once an Outlaw"". I was really disappointed that not only was this not a historical romance but after reading 'Thunder Creek' I was not impressed. I'm no author and I may not be in any postion to critic this book but I know what I like. This is not a 'keeper'."
3,Thunder Creek,"Thunder Creek was a nice read; nothing great, certainly not terrible. Kate returns to Thunder Creek after 14 years, divorced and having miscarried. Her brother had died some 14 years earlier and when Kate arrives she almost immediately discovers that his death may not have been an accident. His best friend, Jackson, is also back in Thunder Creek and Kate has always disliked Jackson, since the death anyway. Now they are thrown together to unravel a mystery, but the most obvious part of the mystery is that the person responsible for everything is almost immediately obvious, so no real build up or surprise. Anyway, it was a nice read, Jackson is a hot character, Kate is good character, not an annoying, cloying woman, and everything winds up as it should be."
3,Katy's Mystery,"Katy's divorce is final and her family can use a helping hand. She had planned never to returned to the painful problems of the past. Fourteen years ago her brother died and she blamed Jackson for his death. Here she faces Jackson and finds him disturbing. She is determine to find the answer to her brother's death and someone does not want her to find the truth. Read Gregory's book and find out how Katy unravels this mystery. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above The River"""
5,Leadership lessons for ALL!,"Jennifer White has put together what I believe is the most comprehensive, realistic, and user friendly users manual for entrepenuers, managers, and CEO's alike! If you are interested in your growth as a leader and are up to the challenge presented by Jennifer and her team of coaches that conspired to bring this together then don't hesistate. If your not, then be willing to give up on realizing your true potential as a leader and as an individual. Yes, you'll be challenged by the exercises. Yes, you will be asked to be honest with yourself. And Yes, you will see RESULTS as you apply what you learn.Go ahead, maximize your productivity, transform chaos into sanity, communicate with power, honor your people, use speed to your advantage, leverage their strengths, and above all GET A LIFE.Your worth it and so is this book!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting some useful ""excercises"" to try with my child, but there were very limited ideas and mostly for pre-schoolers and younger. Few hints were aimed to school age children; however, they were more appropriate for children with higher functions abilieties (i.e. Aspergen syndrome) while my child is low function.I returned the book."
3,no size fits all,"With no size indicator, we'd hoped that the shoes would fit a range of sizes. Unfortunately, they were way too large, and could not be worn."
1,Does not meet professional standards,"This video does not meet professional standards for the industry due to the fact that it shows sign language concepts that are less than basic. For most of my students they have passed this level in the firs quarter of class. These examples are in everyday speech and can easily be practiced with a real Deaf member in your city. I believe that this may be just a quick scheme using our language as a means to profit instead of providing real language concepts that can be reviewed and used as a dictionary or reference guide. Other tapes of much higher quality give at least 60 minutes and provide topics and concepts that will encourage the viewer to be motivated to use. Also I do not recognize any of these individuals as persons from any deaf community I have been involved with. This appears as a ""vanity tape"" instead of a real educational video."
4,"Could not identify ""All Is Lost"" moment :-(","Would have given this 5 out of 5 stars but I have reached the ""Break Into Act 3"" without pin-pointing ""All Is Lost,"" in accordance with Blake Snyder's Beat Sheet (confidential document, unavailable online)."
4,This is an awesome DVD,"Let's start with the name. I think the name ""Lizzie McGuire"" is very cute. It's a perfect name for her. Now little girl Lizzie looks cute, not as sophisticated as 14 - 15 year old Lizzie, but she can still dress with the best of them. Even that horrible unicorn sweater looks great on her. This DVD will contain that episode, and other great classics."
4,Muy buenos bajos,"Estos audifonos tienen una calidad de bajos excelente, son extremadamente portables por su sistema de plegado, son muy comodos en las orejas por tiempos moderados, en tiempos largos empiezan a apretar un poco. Son resistentes y el diseño es muy compacto. Me gustaron."
1,Painful Earphones Cause Pain,These thing hurt and they look stupid because they are bulky and perch on top of your ears. They're really uncomfortable. Don't buy them!!!!
2,"Good Sound, but cheaply made","I purchased these headphones 6 months ago. For the first three months I was pretty happy with them. Great sound quality, they really reduced outside noise on noisy bus rides I take, and they were light and easy to carry.However, while taking them off my head, they broke. The plastic piece holding the earphone simply snapped. I wasn't too rough with them or anything.Reading the warranty more closely, I discovered it said ""Invalid in the United States and Canada."" This is a European company so apparently the product is not warranted in the US.I am going to try sending them back to a service center here in the states, but I would never buy these headphones again. They are too cheaply made. If you spend $50, your headphones shouldn't break."
5,Best collapsible headphones ever!!!,"These are the best collapsible headphones that I've ever owned. Excellent sound quality, good bass, good treble, and very comfortable. I use these on my Apple iPod in work and they're perfect.AKG K 26 P - Headphones ( ear-cup )"
5,"Wonderful product, great tech support","I bought the AKG-K26P, hoping for better sound than my Sennheiser PX-100 headphones. Happy to report I was not disappointed.The sound quality is excellent. Great bass. I use them with my Creative Muvo player on the morning commute.Special mention on AKG's excellent tech support and after-sales service. In 2006, my first pair died after the cable tore. I emailed AKG international office. To my surprise, Mr Peschel from their Austria office responded within 2 days and sent me a brand new pair! His email even assured me they were aware of the temporary problem and it has been resolved.One year later, I'm very happy to report Mr. Peschel was correct. My replacement K26P headphones work perfectly. As a consumer, I'm pleased by their professional responsibility towards a $50 pair of headphones. You simply have to respect a company which stands behind their products like AKG does."
2,Not a good product,"I have been using Senh. PX 100 but I gave it to my brother, so I thought of buying this one, the sound is ok but this product is extremely uncomfortable ..want to wear for 10 minutes, and you will feel the pain, and the worst part is the design , its very small , don't be confused from the picture so doesn't fit well on your ears and the hairs are pulled when you take off...I wont recommend to buy this one, buy senn PX 100, best deal for the money"
3,Model obsolete - warranty no longer honored,"I bought 2 pairs of these headphones about 1 1/2 years ago. I do like the headphones. Not the best fit in the world, but I think they provide excellent sound quality and block out surrounding noise. Great for the price (I found them online for ~$35 at the time.)Unfortunately, one pair is no longer working. Called AKG for warranty replacement/repair and they told me the model is now obsolete and parts are not carried any more. They said they could upgrade to the K414 P for $139.99! Whoa! Looks like an identical product to the K26P.At that price I may just hack into the old headphones myself and try to fix them!Too bad since one reason I buy AKG products is their warranty (2 sometimes 3 year warranties). I may hesitate in the future to buy AKG products that cost more because of this warranty issue."
2,Not for me,"I found the view screen very difficult to read. If the calculator was not held at a certain angle, I couldn't see the numbers at all.Don't know if they are all this way or maybe mine was defecive - it was out of it's wrapper when I recieved it. Also, this was my first scientific calculator and I found the directions rather confusing. I returned it for credit with no hassle."
1,Broken and returned,"I bought the calculator for a science class. I can only give 1 star for it because:1) In my package the calculator and menu fell out from an opened plastic case. It seemed to me I had received a used product. This was not really an issue to me if it would work well but,2) the screen dim significantly after I turned the power on. The problem existed even after I let it receive some sun shine to recharge. I had to turn the calculator with a specific angle so that I can read the digits on the display. The problem was likely due to its shorten battery life (because it was used before?). This was also tolerable since the price was so cheap and I might buy a new battery for it but,3) the display couldn't show digits properly after I turned on the calculator for a third time. Part of the screen began to display nothing.That's how I got really pissed off by it and ordered another model from a local store."
1,Poor battery,The calculator may not have been new as the package was unsealed. The battery is weak and the numbers show poor contrast.Prolonged exposure to light did not help. I would definitely not recommend this seller. I was too busy to return this item. So I lost out. Fortunately the item was not too expensive.
4,i did not regret this purchase,"in my search for the most comfortable sandal at at cheap price i will have to give this sandal third place. it looks good its strong, stronger than campion c9 by far, and not to pricey either. the pair i would give first place are the champion hollywood slides but amozon does not carry them."

3,3 * Misleading Title: More Body Than Brain,"This book is really more about the organs and tissues then the brain. Because the brain regulates the entire body, the author spends an inordinate (and misleading, from the title) amount of time on topics other than the brain; for example, the different types of teeth, and the layers of the skin. For this reason, a lot of fascinating brain-related information is omitted.The author is also a bit too glib, and this gives a very mixed tone of the serious and the off cuff: ""the two are brought together by sexual intercourse (a term often shortened to `sex' when people are in a hurry""). Moreover, admonishments to care for your body (brush your teeth, exercise more, etc.) seemed out of place. On the positive side, the book has some fun illustrations (although a too cluttered at times), and the large color pictures of the organs and brain are fairly easy to understand. 62 pages, with a short glossary and an index."
2,Hal Kemp & His Orchestra,I was disappointed that I could not see the titles of the musical numbers on the Hal Kemp Album - so I did not place an order.
5,"Typical Radiohead, which is good of course.","There There is propably the most straight-foward rock song on the new album. I really appreciate the use of guitar on this song.I can see, or better yet, hear why the the two Bs, Paperbag writer and Where bluebirds fly, are Bs. They are inconsistent in sound with the songs on the LP. That doesn't mean they aren't good songs. I don't think Radiohead knows how to make bad songs. Just don't expect rock.Paperbag writer: Henry Mancini meets 80's funk guitar and hip-hop beats. It's kind of weird, but all very cool. Funky.Where bluebirds fly has three main elements: a kind of tribal african electronica polyrythmic groove, what sounds like a fast moving diminished arpegio, and long-tone ghostly vocals with synthesizer in the same diminished scale or something. Haunting, creepy, beautiful."
4,Here Here for There There,"Being a devout Radiohead follower, I had to plunk down my coins for this single. I was already impressed with the Go To Sleep b-sides, and was thrilled when I heard these 2 new tracks. Track 1 is just the album version of There There. Track 2 Which is called Paperbag Writer, is a great Radiohead song, but is easily identifiable as a b-side. Thom and the boys tend to put these melancholy songs aside and then they pop up when they need to fill a single with extras. Track 3, However, was worth the price of this cd on it's own!!! Where Bluebirds Fly. This track got me up on my feet and moving like no other Radiohead song has before. The melody is haunting, the bass is pure trance and the hushed vocal chanting seams it all together. Be warned: This is only for the die-hard Radiohead fan, casual listeners should just buy Hail To The Thief and take it from there(there)."
3,Not much to write home about,This single is similar to what you would get from the knives out or pyramid song singles. It is in no way a return to rock...but I kind of like it. Paperbag writer is the better of the two B-sides. Still both very Kid A/Amnesiac like. Final Verdict: its worth picking up.
4,"There There, best Radiohead song in recent memory","Not much more to say regarding the afformentioned title track of this disk...the only way to improve upon it is to see them play it live!The B-sides are consistent with most of the extra tracks from the ""Kid A""/""Amnesiac"" sessions (with the exception of Cuttooth and Worrywort -both stronger than most of the songs that made it on to those two albums!). I was, however, pleasantly surprised when I heard the first few seconds of ""Where Bluebirds Fly;"" those fans who where out on the Spain/Portugal tour last summer will recognize those beats as the wierd opening music that would play just before the band took stage!! I had nearly forgotten about it!Be Happy that there is new Radiohead out there to be had -Listen and enjoy!"
3,Disapointing B-sides,"Though ""there there"" definitly takes you to another dimension, the other 2 tracks were really dispointing. Electronica doesn't fit Radiohead and Tom's voice can't even help bring life to those depthless songs. They sound like bad outtakes from the Kid-A era (especially ""Where Bluebirds Fly""), put aside for some time, and eventually pulled out of the bin for some reasons that keep eluding me.Don't waste your money on that single: rather wait for the new LP!"
4,"Have the Cassette, NEEDED the CD",A friend gave me the cassette of this album years ago and I totally wore it out. Really liked the sound combination these guys put together. Always love a sax in a rock band and a raspy singer.
5,The Essential Joni Mitchell - a snapshot in time,"Intense and emotional, Joni performs 18 of her most moving songs and Greatest Hits with backup from Tom Scott and the LA Express, providing one of the best live albums of the 70's. Her voice is at it's peak, soaring through her masterful lyrics and unique melodies with confidence and powerful insight. ""Miles of Isles"" is Joni Mitchell at her all time best and is a must have for any fan. Outstanding production value combined with her joy of performing, makes this live album a performance masterpiece."
4,Just Put on the Second Half,"I agree with the reviewers who find Tom Scott and the L.A. Express to be a detriment to Joni's sound -- compare this band to the superlative band she toured with on Shadows and Light (Metheny, Pastorius) and the deficiencies are obvious. But then I've had a grudge against Scott ever since he mucked up George Harrison's Extra Texture (Read All About It).Turn out the lights and put on the second half -- Joni lights up the acoustic, sparsely-accompanied set with her incredible voice and spirit. I love her delicate, committed versions of ""Circle Game"" and ""Both Sides Now,"" the beautiful ""Real Good for Free,"" the aching version of ""People's Party.""It's worth picking this up for the acoustic set. Also, the inside photos of Joni are precious -- we love you, thank you for your art."
5,Live recordings don't come much better.,"I loved listening to this album back in the mid'70s during my college days, and I still enjoy it just as much today. The combination of Joni with Tom Scott and the L.A. Express gives some of her earlier songs a new sound that worked remarkably well. I've been disappointed that a lot of live albums don't really capture the feel of the concert well, and they don't have the sound quality of a studio album. This CD seems to do both. ""A Case of You"" and ""The Last Time I Saw Richard"" are my personal favorites, but there is not a dud in the entire lineup of songs. Anyone who is even marginally a Joni Mitchell fan will enjoy this one."
2,"Great talent, disappointing concert","I'm a huge fan of Joni Mitchell -- few in the history of recorded music have approached her prodigious talents as both a singer and a songwriter. That said, ""Miles of Aisles"" -- both the LP and the concert tour, was a disappointment. Her collaboration with Tom Scott and the LA Express worked poorly, despite the great sound of Scott's band. I actually attended the concert -- at Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass., about 500 years ago, and I remember feeling the same way back then."
5,Joni Fan Foever,"I've been a fan of Joni's since the early 70's. Absolutely love her(and had an opportunity to see her in the Burg). I think that when Tom Scott & the L A Express played for her, she was at her best! This live c.d. is fabulous, I have worn out albums, tapes and now on the 2nd c.d of Miles of Ailes."
2,Sleepy Live Album,"This live album contains most of Joni's hits from the period. Backed by the Tom Scott's horn section, there are parts of this disk that really rock. Unfortunately, even with the impressive cast of supporting musicans there is a lack of consistency. Some of the songs do not translate well in the live format, leaving me wondering if lies in the recording or the artist's live personna. The LA Express does save some of the arrangements and punches some life into these tunes, but still there is a lack of energy for a live release."
4,A midcareer summary statement,"In 1974 Joni was at the top of her national fame and this live albumn is full of short selections from her previous albumns. The music was recorded over 4 consecutive nights of live concert and knowing this, I would have loved to have been there all four nights! The strength of the CD lies in the selection of the 18 songs.There are the fun, witty, love and social commentary songs such as ""You Turn Me On I'm A Radio"" and ""Big Yellow Taxi"". There are the amazing love-lost songs that haunt you like a ghost, such as ""A Case of You"" and ""The Last Time I saw Richard"". There are also the philosphical works, reflecting on the nature of human existence - its joys and sorrows - such as ""Both Sides Now"" and ""The Circle Game"". I especially like the jaded sophisticated songs that reflect Joni's superstar status, such as ""People's Parties"".As a popular poet, Joni ranks with Robert Browning, a philospher in love that tells great stories."
1,...my ten-year old's a more sensitive editor...,"I only enjoyed half of this album on vinyl ... the latter half.And if the performance had been transferred intact from the vinyl version, I'd give it three stars.There's some terrific music on this album.BUTThis 'transfer' from vinyl to CD is a SUCH a hack job. One can easily hear the crude edits. The intimate dialogue from the original recording was completely removed.Truly, my little boy could have done a better remastering job.For shame."
4,Good Book for Teens,"This book gives the reader an in depth view of training for the most top secert/elite unit in the U.S. Army, the Special Forces (Delta). The author states several times that he will try to give as much detail as he can without breaching unit security. With the riggerous training and grulling psychological testing, there are some instances of humor, I will not go into any detail. To find out you will just have to read it for your self."
5,book,very good book filled with a lot of insights into the inner workings of Delta force. Make me proud that these guys our on our side.
5,"""Have a good 'un.""","This is a great book telling the story of Cmd Sgt Major Eric Haney as he goes through the demanding training en route to becoming a member of Delta Force. It includes an account of the training for the later aborted Tehran hostage mission. It gives one insight to the complexity of getting the various branches of the military and intelligence agencies to cooperate fully in accomplishing the mission. The spirit, dedication and camaraderie illustrated within show the foundation for the work done various theaters in the past 30 plus years, including the recent action in Afghanistan by the Navy Seal team."
2,Wait a minute,"Be advised that this is a shortened version for ""Young Readers"" and not the original book written by Eric Haney. This version starts and ends with the Selection process and leaves out the balance of the various training and operations (about 2/3)ontained in the original book. It is a good read for what it is but the full version is much better. The product description does not make clear that this is a different version. This ""Young Readers"" version in hardback ran 246pp."
4,Very Very interesting- but not written by a writer,"There are times I need to go back and look things up. The plot is sometimes erratic and i am left wondering where did this character come in to play, however I am very interested in the subject and it has been a very fun read. Overall if you want to know how Delta Force came to be and want to hear old war stories, this is a buy."
5,good,Good book. Very interesting and informative in ways. The author is vague in some parts but that is understandable. A+
5,Good Insight into Delta Force and the Politics behind them,"Good book, read right through it in one day. He will take you all over the world and through the training to be a member of Delta Force. They are relentless and fierce warriors that don't do it for attention. Good detail in the book with an honest voice telling how it really is."
4,"fun read, nothing more","first half of the book is narrative of the whole selection process on how a 180 recruiting class narrowed down to 1/10th.it felt at times a little boastful at times and some details were likely embellished (as is commonly accused) - but i imagine this is necessary to make compelling story-telling, like for a campfire.its not a full treatise into politics behind df, and i dont think it was meant to be so. overall it was a very easy and enjoyable read, and haney gives a good description into the arduous delta selection. nothing here substantial or weighty or to make one think, but a fun weekend reading. worth the 10$"
4,Invisible Heroes,"This is a story of remarkable men, who like the author Eric Haney, have put their lives on the line to keep us safe. The book is surprisingly well written by a career soldier but it does leave this reader wishing for more details of missions and fewer details of the selection process. This book is well worth the price."
4,Educational Read !!,Very interesting.. I picked up this book after watching the 'Unit' series broadcast. Great first-person perspective of the 'operator' selection process.
3,This is for teens,"I was buying this as a gift for my husband, but this is the teen version of the book. However, it doesn't state that anywhere in any of the info previous to my purchase. I only realized it when I received the book and looked at the back cover by the barcode."
3,"Good Book, Opposite of Rogue Warrior","I have seen Eric Haney quite often talking about Terrorism on the O'Reilly factor. Therefore I was very excited when his book came out in paperback, so I could read his story and the story of Delta Force.I mention Rogue Warrior because Haney was a founding member of Delta force, the armies counterterrorism unit and Marchinko was the found of SEAL Team 6, the navy's anti-terror unit.Both books do a great job describing why these units were founded and why we needed these units to protect our freedoms. But while Rouge Warrior is a great book for being over the top, rude, crude, and boombastic, Inside Delta Force is great while being much more subtle and formal. These books are like Yin and Yang, but both are great and are must reads.Haney is a brave man and a great writer while keeping everything low key.This is a good book"
5,excellent,A very good book that explains military life to civilians but not to the point that it takes away from the story. One of the most interesting books I've read in a very long time.
4,"""You are there...""",This story is from one of the men who was there and who made the sacrifices to be one of our finest & best. It also shows some of the political side of our recent conflicts. It was reccomended to me by a former Ranger who said it might answer some of my questions. I found it quite informative as well as an interesting read.
5,A MUST READ!!!!!,"This is a must have book for anyone interested in books of military subjects!! I give it 10 stars! CSM Haney takes you into the world of the secret and elite Army Delta Force like no one else could. You are given a taste of what these brave soldiers go through from selection to missions and CSM Haney leaves you begging for more! I couldn't put this book down! If you haven't read this book than you are missing out on one, if not, the best military book written by someone who was there and braved it through to the end. I just wish that we had more folks like CSM Haney in the service. He is a true American hero!"
5,A must for your Military book Collection,"Great Book. When ever I was in we always looked up to the Delta guys. First Is it true that the Govt new about Vietnam POWs but did nothing about it? Second Haney is a true patriot. Finally have a ""good un'"""
5,Inside Delta Force - Excellent Book,"CSM Haney's experiences in the US Army and especially noteworthy is Delta. I retired from the US Army in 1980 after assignments with the 3/325, 82nd Abn Div, Co P 75th Rangers, Quang Tri, RVN, and 1st Ranger Bn, Fort Stewart, GA.Inside Dela Force is a great read,Thanks,Frank Couvillion, R.N.Atlanta, GA"
5,An indepth back stage pass to the secret world of Delta,"I saw this book and just knew I had to read it. Many people of heard of the mysterious Delta Force, but very little specific information is known. Eric Haney provides great insight into the covert world of these Delta Force operators. His personnel account takes the reader through the intense selection one needs to complete prior to becoming an operator. He provides great insight into the training that keeps these operators sharp. He even discusses some of the operations that Delta force has completed through out its history. All in all it provides some great info about this organization of elite Delta Force operators."
2,Not what I expected,I was hoping this book talked about the actual missions. It does not at all! It goes over the selection process and training process. The part about the selection process held my attention. The part about training was a little dry.
1,Amazing: the US SF community seems to have more than its share of lies.,"This is another book I read years ago and just recently I am becoming painfully aware that the US SF community seems to have a lot of its members that are willing to lie for the dollar!In the same day, my opinion about Plaster, Nicholson and now Haney has gone down big time.Or do they know the same ""funny secret"" and that in the end what matters is the $?It seems that the US SF need to revise their selection processes or their priorities unless the alleged moral superiority is but a lie and its all business as usual. From honour to banditry, in the long term?My greetings to all men who stand for Truth and Honour."
4,Excellent book,"Despite the fact that Eric Haney is generally hated in the special forces community, and the likelihood that his book is more fiction than fact. I found it to be a very good read. If you take it only as fiction, it would easily compete with the writings of Tom Clancy, Daniel Silva, Frederick Forsyth, and other military/spy authors.I wouldn't suggest this book if you want to learn about the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (Airborne)... as I doubt any writings you find about it will be true, mostly speculation or fantasy... however if you want a good, fun, read... get this book. Good Job Haney.-Ryan Mercer"
4,Great Book,"The book is very entertaining and is well written. It is important to note that the book is not like the TV show, it simply tells about the inception of Delta Force and how it began. Little of the book is actually about the missions they go on. Even without that it is still a good read."
4,Great Buy,"Excellent condition, this book provides an in depth to the real life of Delta's members, training and operations. A must for any special forces enthusiast."
4,The creation of The Delta Force,"Eric Haney, tells his tale as one of the founding members of the Delta Force, and what it took to to become a member. This book is filled with tons of informative information, plus little trinkets Eric toss's in here and there(for instance fill a squirt gun with ammonia to knock a man out).However there is nothing other, then the selection process to become a delta member, and training. There is not a journal from jungle missions, to desert ops(although Haney makes reference to comrades he later fights with, some of whom die).Despite that, this book is still very appealing. It teaches you the stunning thing these men are capable of, such as boarding airplanes in flight and the rigourous training, that makes them as close to invincible as any man will ever become.All in all, great book, great group of men it's based on."
4,Silent Professionals,"A very well written book that gives you an insight into the lives and committments of these silent professionals. As a 24 year veteran of the Army who also spent some time in this unit, it was interesting to hear CSM Haney's spin. I had the pleasure to meet Col Beckwith and have the utmost respect for any man who puts the safety and lives of others before their own. I would recommend to anyone, especially a military person who wants to know what happens inside that fence.."
4,Not bad for the price,"This isn't the showiest CD rack, but it looks decent. Also holds the CDs nicely. Stores many (45)CDs in a small space with jewel cases. A good deal for the price."
2,not the greatest,This cd storage unit isnt the greatest cd rack but if you want something that will do the job and isnt too costly this is the thing for you. it is made from plastic
4,Georgia Cracker,If space is important than this may work for you. We live in a town house and have very limited space. The product is well made with some minor flaws. It requires you to put it together and that is work. We got ours from Cross furniture and got prompt service.
4,like this CD,this is a good CD. but it is missing something(s) treat me right and crimson and clover. Pat did a good job on both of these songs.
4,"Well, Let's Call It ""Pretty Darn Good Shots""","Not quite her ""best"", but a decent career overview. Most casual fans and the idle curious will probably be well satisfied - with ""Hit Me..."", ""Love Is a Battlefield"" and ""We Belong"", how could they not be? As usual with best-of packages, there are several ""what-th'-heck?"" items, including ""One Love"", and most notably a live version of ""Hell Is For Children"" (in addition to the studio version!). ""Little Too Late"", ""Looking for a Stranger"" and ""Treat Me Right"" would've all been better choices. But the balance of the disc holds up. My faves are ""Promises in the Dark"", ""We Live for Love"" and ""Shadows of the Night"", but why not pick up a copy and find your own faves?"
5,This has it all!,"As a child of the 80's and a daughter of a DJ, I heard my share of Pat. Since age 6, I have been a diehard Pat fan. This album has it all. From the 80's anthem Love Is a Battlefield (my personal favorite) to the gritty Hell is For Children, it's all here, it's all Pat, and it's all good. If you love Pat and the 80's, you must have this album."
4,"Good value, but not complete.","For hard-driving well-crafted rock-and-roll from the late 70s/early 80s, you can't do much better than Pat Benatar (and Heart) and this collection carries most -- but not all -- of the singles that dominated the airwaves for 4 years: Heart Breaker, Hit me With Your Best Shot, Love is a Battlefield, Fire and Ice, Promises in the Dark. But no Benatar collection is complete without 'Treat Me Right', 'You Better Run', and 'I Want a Lover who won't drive me crazy' (superior, in my opinion, to the John Mellencamp version), especially if you prefer Benatar's hard-driving rockers to her slower ballads.Nevertheless, 'Best Shots' is a great place to start and certainly - at $10-15 versus $50 for the more complete 'All Fired Up' -- the best value for the money."
3,pretty good,Pat Benatar had a certain way&style of getting her voice over on the music she was doing.some things worked&some didn't.she has edge in her material.overall it's more of a time period than lasting good material.still Benatar has solid moments here.
4,classic,downloaded for my phone i listen to it while i prep in my kitchen at work before the shop opens Rockin out haha
4,old school,ya this old school album is great all the hits from the 80s ive been having a good time with it
4,great cd-could have included more.,"Pat Benatar was the rock-chick of the 80's. I remember waiting for this album to come out to have all her hits in one place-well they weren't. Her top-50 hits LITTLE TOO LATE, YOU BETTER RUN, TREAT ME RIGHT, LOOKING FOR A STRANGER,& SEX AS A WEAPON AREN'T INCLUDED. they should have and other songs such as ONE LOVE, OUTLAW BLUES AND THE LIVE VERSION OF HELL IS FOR CHILDREN SHOULDA BEEN DROPPED. THANKFULLY THE ALL FIRED UP 2-DISC SET HAD IT ALL.BUT 5 YEARS AFTER THIS RELEASE."
3,MXR 10 Band Graphic EQ,"I'm primarily a hobbyist but have been playing guitar for the past 17 years. I got this pedal basically so that I do not have to change guitars to change my tone (for example, from a raging humbucker to a skanking strat tone in the same song). I confess, this is the first graphic eq pedal that I have ever had, so maybe I was expecting too much. This is perhaps the most tweakable eq pedal out there, so I got it for that quality.First thing I noticed is that I got unwanted hiss and noise the moment I plugged it this pedal. Too much for me, in fact. I used the provided eq examples to try it out, but I did not really find a tone I could not get from tweaking the amp's own eq knobs, plus the added noise just pretty much ruined it for me.The pedal itself is built like a tank, like all MXR pedals. Quality was never an issue.I know there is a mod out there that would eliminate the hiss, but as it is, I really cannot stand it. I returned it.Thanks for reading!"
4,stella,"I ordered the watch because I liked the way it looked. When i received it, I did not realize that there was no warrantey. It appeared to be an outdated model and did not have any warrranty at all."
4,Live Shows,"I think that this band puts on a good show, and for my first time seeing and hearing them, they ""ROCKED"" This album is a must buy I think."
2,Eh...,"To be honest, i took a total stab on this band when I purchased the CD. I had no idea who they were. After completing track 1 (All We Know), I was thinking to myself that this will be a gem. I was wrong. No other song did anything for me. Some will fall in love with this band, but if you have a selective taste, stay away. The best song is, ""All We Know""."
5,Absolutely fantastic awesome,"This is one of the best metal albums I heard in a long time.If there's someone that don't like it, should learn more about music, I mean, this have great melodies, great riff guitars, great vocals, this is awesome, better than mostly of this new metal bands today, they deserve more reconigzement from the critics... I can't skip one track from this album, all tracks are so good. This remember me, the first two albums from finger eleven, that are awesome too, you cant skip one song from them too. Well, my favorite tracks are: Someday (maybe the best track), all we know, myself, you can't look away ( love this one too), media (felt in love for this) and Even Though It's Over (awesome song too)... if you like good metal. If you heard ""someday"", and like it, buy this!!"
1,dosen't workits,"its good for looks but in the nite it dosen't light up like cateyes are suppose to! don't waste ur money on this, just not worth it!"
3,It's OK,"I've never been a huge Jackson Browne fan, but Running on Empty isn't bad. The best cuts are the title track, You Love the Thunder, Cocaine and Stay. But songs like Shaky Town, Rosie & Love Needs a Heart are fillers. You've got to give the guy credit for trying something new with the live album, too - none of these songs had been released on a Jackson Browne album up until this point, and it's a concept album about life on the road. Not half bad, but I can think of better singer-songwriters (cough cough Joni Mitchel)"
2,Not Good,"Agree this has not aged well at all -- ""Cocaine"" is the absolute low point of his recording career -- HORRIBLE song. Just what I want to hear is a bunch of morons snorting up and singing out of tune -- now that's talent. Rest of the album is ok with a couple of great tunes -- Running on Empty, You Love the Thunder and The Load Out/Stay. Try ""The Pretender"", ""Late For the Sky"", ""Hold Out"" or even ""Lawyers in Love"" before this one."
2,Hasn't aged well,"This album may have sounded great back in 1978, but 20 years later it clearly has not aged well. To hear Jackson Browne sing the line ""that's a big 10-4/from your back door"" is downright painful. Maybe this CD can serve as an interesting relic from the late 70's, but for contemporary listening one needs to move on."
1,I felt cheated!,"After listening to the CD I was furious. It's not a studio recording... it's a live recording. As much as I enjoy Jackson Browne I felt cheated and decieved into purchasing a live recording. No where on the packaging does it indicate it's a live recording. Frankly, I'd rather listen to nothing than listen to fans in the back-ground! I don't care how much I enjoy Jackson Browne's music... I'll be damn if I waste another dime on another of his CD's untill I can be damn sure it's a studio recording.I'm so angry I'm tempted to dig the pieces of the discs out of the trash and mail them back to Electra/Rhino along with an accompanying nasty-gram regarding deceptive marketing/packaging!As it is I personally feel a total refund is in order!"
1,Great music - disappointing DVD,"The music is great, but the DVD is nothing more than a collection of pictures (i.e., STILL IMAGES) from the concert tour. I should have read the fine print. Today, one just naturally expects concert footage. Put on the CD you've already got, surf the web for Jackson Browne web sites and spend the money on something else."
1,Buy the album: don't download the MP3s,"If you want to hear Jackson Browne's ""Running On Empty"" the way it was intended to sound, you have to buy the CD or album. The MP3 cuts off the first 30 seconds of the first track, which consists entirely of crowd noise but sets the tone for the album. It's an embarrassment to mankind that this MP3 version of the album contains edited material!"
5,Perfect,Great fun listening to the music I grew up with. Album just what I was hoping for. Thank you. Amazing how much air time music of the 70s gets today.
5,Jackson Browne's last masterpiece,"Jackson Browne recorded some great music in the 1970s, culminating with ""Running on Empty,"" the most ambitious ""live"" album in rock history. All of the songs are new and many were recorded in unusual locations (such as a hotel room). The title track is Browne's best known song, but there are many other classics here, culminating with ""The Load Out/Stay,"" which turns into a surprise duet. This is a must have album for anyone interested in 70s rock."
5,History in the making,"Not many records can mark a time, an era. Even fewer can help create it. This record surely does, and the proof is that after all these years you can continuosly hear this record and never feel bored. Magical..."
3,Pretty good,"I'm a total Jackson Browne novice - this is the first (and only) album of his that I've ever heard. It's definitely inspired me to check out some of his other recordings. 'Cocaine' is the standout here. Great, loose ('chemically relaxed?') sound on this one. 'The Road' and 'Shaky Town' - yeah, 10-4's n' all! - are also pretty strong. Some forgettable me-too moments (I don't like the title track at all), but overall a satisfying listen. Now, where do I go from here?ALSO RECOMMENDED: 'Using & Abusing the Internet as a Marketing Tool' by Jeff Burns."
4,DVD-AUDIO VERSION,A classic album re-mixed in to multi-channel sound. I find the mix subtle but suitable for the music of this disc. The overall sound depth and clarity is a definite step up from the regular CD.
5,Easily Browne's Best,"When I first got this album in 1977, it knocked me over. One of the best live albums ever recorded. Every song is a gem from start to finish. In my opinion, any greatest hits album that Browne comes out with should include every song on this album and sprinkled with a few of his absolute best from all the other albums.A fun album because the songs are fun, the band is having fun and is playing tight and it still has a professional feel along with a touch of that raw garage band sound. This is THE album to have of Jackson Browne's."
5,I love this record,"I know The Pretender gets more attention, but this is my favorite Jackson Browne album. This one isn't as slick as The Pretender, but I think it's got more soul. People who like contemporary country music would probably like this record a lot, too, it's the kind of california rock that seems to be influencing a lot of what's going on in country now.I agree with other reviewers who say that it evokes and creates a certain period of time.Right now, as I write this, I'm listening to ""Rosie"" for the first time in more than a decade -- I'm very glad I bought the cd."
5,I don't feel empty after listening to it,"This is the only Jackson Browne cd I've got and I really don't care if certain fans dismiss it as bland or catchy - everytime I play it (very often by the way) takes me somewhere I'm only while listening to it. Great singing by Browne and a top notch band. It's a very original concept album (Recorded live either on stage, in the tour bus, in hotel rooms and backstage too) about life on the road.Highlights for me include the title track, The Road, Shaky Town and especially Nothing But Time - how moving is Browne's introduction and his performance (On piano and vocals) is unlike anything else you may have heard. The other tracks are great too - listen to the weary and stoned singing on Cocaine, for instance. The only complain I have is that Stay was cut off.All in all, a very emotional and enjoyable album. Get it."
5,DVD-A : Running On Empty - simply awesome,"It was worth the wait for the release, the sound quality for the album is fantastic. Crisp highs, excellent bass. I highly recommend."
2,Sorry to disagree but...,"I liked Wide Sargasso Sea and thought this book had promise (based on the back cover synopsis). That will teach me to fall for the b.c. synopses, which I should have learned by now. I think the story is not at all compelling, but could have been if we'd learned just a bit more about the characters, their motivations, their backgrounds. I found the writing annoying: in reading passages of dialog I was often startled to see that a quotation was what a character was thinking, not saying. These ""thought quotations"" were mixed in w/ ""spoken quotations,"" making for jumpy reading. A graceless approach to telling a slight but potentially graceful story. I DID like her descriptions of Paris and other French cities. And I was intrigued by her frequent mention of the color red. I might try other books by her, but it's unlikely."
4,Inu-yasha Action,"""I Want to Change the World"" is the title opening song for the first episode, and the sequence that goes along with the song is terrific. It has intense action as well as shows the heartbreak of the relationship between Kikyo and Inuyasha, and the pain that lingers in his heart from her betrayal.In this DVD, we see a softer side of Sesshomaru. As Inuyasha finally discovers how to use the Windscar on Tetsaiga, his older brother is wounded. A little mute girl takes a liking to Sesshomaru as he is nursing his wounds and ego in the woods. I won't spoil it, but Sesshomaru also discovers the secret of his sword and uses it.A new character, Koga the wolf-demon, is introduced. He is introduced as evil, but towards the end Kagome is not sure if he is. Koga and Inuyasha have immediate bad blood.The sounds effects, animation, and voice acting are seamless. There is a lot of humor as the swordmaster who forged the brothers' swords comes back riding a three-eyed cow. He is so funny."
5,Good selection!,"This reviewer would have to disagree with the previous review. I believe the selection is appropriate for this type of collection. To have both Piano Concerti on the compilation wouldn't be very tasteful. The most important things were there - Daphne et Chloe, Gaspard de la Nuit, Tzigane, G Major Piano Concerto, and everything else. I would be highly disappointed if any these were missing. The performers all do a 1st rate job except for Accardo's Tzigane. I prefer Joshua Bell for this beast. And of course, Argerich, the all mighty herself - to not have her representing the Concerto and Gaspard de la Nuit would be a travesty. All this coming from a Ravel fanatic who has played his complete works for piano!"
1,how is this insanely racist animal published?,"Contreras broadcast on Feb. 10, 2004: ""Only toothless hillbillie [sic]white males are too uneducated and too stupid to understand the point of my writings is that Mexican illegal aliens who sneak into gringo-occupied Mexican land are better than Whitey."""
1,Horrible- inaccurate,Raoul Contreras writes this very biased and racist book based on his own opinions- not based on fact.If you want to read the TRUTH about illegal immigration- read Frosty Wooldridge's new book: Immigration's Unarmed Invasion.
5,Essential,"If you're reading this review, then that means you've scrolled all the way down the page and maybe even clicked a link or two before deciding to buy this record. And that, my friend, is a waste of valuable time that you could be spending listening to this remarkable collection of songs.If you're a Burns fan already, this CD will simply deepen your love for the (other) Bard's work. If you're new to Burns, this CD will inspire you to grab a copy of his poems and start reading. And if you don't care about Burns at all, this album is simply beautiful.Reader has a lucious, enchanting voice. She's also an excellent arranger, breathing new life into some of the ultimate war horses, such as ""My Love Is Like A Red, Red Rose"" and ""Auld Lang Syne."" Some of the arrangements are lush and haunting, while others, like the first track, are spritely and spirited.Whatever. Get this record right now."
4,refreshing and uplifting interpretation,different approaches depending on the song but always refreshing and generally delivered with feeling and passion. a welcome reinterpretation of old favourites
3,Yep.,"Ahh, punk rock for the working class. These guys are going to be the next Dropkick Murphys. they're a quartet hailing from New Jersey, and they play politically charged punk rock [incredibly well] for the masses. The CD clocks in at a whopping 41:07 [which, to me, seems like a lot for a band of this type], but the time flies by so very quickly. The singer has a lot to say in each song, too, and he does it with such a frantic growl that you can't help but get psyched up for song after song. Like I mentioned before, there's a significant Dropkick influence here, plus maybe some Bouncing Souls and Ann Beretta. And of course, there's elements of the old-school punk and oi! bands intertwined. So if you're looking for a good CD to come home from the factory every night and crank up while drinking a brew or two, look no further: the Hudson Falcons are your band."
3,Selling always selling,"This is a catchy little boook and I thought it would be inspirational for my sales team so I purchashed one for each. While it has some interesting ideas it tends to be repetitious and covers little new territory.Some of his ""inspiration"" is a bit crude and offensive. My major objection is the author's constant attempts to get people on to his website to sell more products. He offers a free visit on specific topics, but then to get more info you have to buy another of his products. I also found out too late that this book is one of a series of sales coaching books he produces, and apparently I should have read the prequel to this.Basically, I resent paying money to read pages of hard-sell advertising for more of the author's books and web-based products.It is somewhat motivational but only for novice sales people."
2,Disappointing,"The book offers very general points already covered by the hundreds of sales books written before. Did not like the constant reference to the author's website for additional details/information. I was looking for a little sales motivation, not being ""sold"" to..."
3,A few good nuggets,"It was a good primer to sales. Halfway through reading it, I ordered another of his books called The Sales Bible.I felt like part of it didn't apply to me. Online sales is a lot different to tracking down the CEO of a company and arranging an in person meeting.Still, I got a lot out of it. It was a relief to hear someone from the real word say, authoritively, that trust leads to sales. It was a quick read but Gitomer packed a lot into a compact book. I think that most people businesses would be able to find lots of nuggets to adapt to their business."
5,Life Changing Advice,"I'm 80/20'ing all my books, and this is definitely a ""keeper"".I found a piece of advice I needed right now, one with the potential to reduce my stress by 80%.No, I'm not going to tell you the specific advice that worked for me today, you'll have to find a page written just for you. Don't worry, there's lots of wisdom to choose from."
2,Needs work... a LOT of work,"This book is poorly written, poorly formatted, poorly laid out... that said, there are some good things (else he gets 1 star) but they are few and far between and almost not worth searching for.Mostly a self-aggrandizing tome to himself. Not worth the money or your time as he makes the reading of it fairly painful..."
1,Waste of Time and Money Folks!!,"This book is by far the worse sales book I have ever read! On second thought, it's the worst book I've have ever read, period. Not only is the tone condescending it's insulting as well. No business professional uses the saying ""you suck"" about 50 times within one book! Just the thing a person who wants to get better at their profession needs to hear more of ""you suck"". Jerry talks in generalities the entire book with the exception of the voicemail and networking part. As other reviews mentioned, this book actually has very little about selling at all. Trust me, you will thank me later do not waste your time or money on this one. Don't let the red color book fool you."
1,Terrible read...,"I'm convinced the people who gave this book a five star rating either didn't read it or are related to the author. The book has no substance, and the author is constantly advising you to buy all his other products that will help you become succesful. This is ironic, since he's claiming to know all these things about sales, but pushes these on you before he has even had a chance to prove the value add of the book you're currently reading... Crazy? The author never even convincingly validates himself as any type of sales expert - credibility is vital and there just isn't any here. I had high expectations for this, but in short this is a book filled with cliche and ripped off mantras... Don't waste your time."
4,Helpful,This was okay! Too much reference to web site. Would be better if all the information was in one book.
5,Little Red Bood of selling,"This is one of the better sales, self help books out there in my opinion. I wasnt expecting to be impressed from the cover but Jeff does not disappoint. His use of jokes and pictures to convey his messages makes it a quick read. A must read for the salesman who continously wants to grow and keep a positive attitude. Guidelines is a word that suggest lasting, basic and important. Jeff's work is a foundation for building a better sales career. For more years than I wnat to admit, I have been reading books on selling. Jeff has a unique ability to condense helpful advice into a concentrated format that is readable and executable like few other writer on the subject of sales. There is a lesson for the marketer within each of us in the presentation of the book. The title itself is a nice sales pitch also."
2,More about checking out his website than providing content,"Lots of good reviews but I felt it was primarily written to drive people to his website which was very distracting. Motivational? Telling people ""You suck"" lessens the impact of the point he's trying to get across. I'm passing on the rest of his books and maybe you should too."
1,A memorable worse sales book,I have read many sales book in the past 12 months. I am researching available information on sales for a masters program paper I am doing. This is by far the worst of over 75 books I have read. Rehashed information. Outdated ideas. All hype very little substance. A waist of time and money. This book deserves zero stars.
1,LITTLE RED BOOK OF SELLING : 12.5 Principles of Sales Greatness,"Being new to the Sales field of work, I found this book easy to read and motivating. It was a quick read and I have used it to reference when I needed some quick reminders."
2,"I've learned a lot, BUT...","I'm not in sales and I can see that I can adapt a lot of ideas here to a project on which I'm working. Here's my only beef. Gitomer is ""all about value."" And when I looked at this book I thought, ""gosh, he really practices what he preaches by giving all this extra stuff at his website."" Then I went to the website and the first four times I put in the words he put in the book for accessing extra info from his website, all I got were the material that was right there in the book. Word for word.Of course, he doesn't have to give anything away but having offered to do so, I think he should follow through on his promise. So now I'm wondering about the value of what he did provide. Is this really good info on how to sell??? I'm not sure anymore. He doesn't seem to be walking his talk and it's soured my whole approach to the book."
2,Nothing really new.....,"....the same ""mantras"" are heard in ""teamwork"" sessions at major corporations and multi-level marketing seminars nationwide. All that's happened here is yet another enterprising entrepreneur combined them all and figured the best way to make money was to sell books."
5,"The Git Man ""Gets It!""","Jeffrey is the GURU of selling...or rather getting people to want (to love) to buy. Ya gotta luv his ""in your face get off your duff and do something style"", if you don't, well, don't buy his book...AND QUIT YOUR SALES CAREER...NOW! Cuz it's dead!As a reviewer you need to know I am biased, I have loved Jeffrey's book from the moment I picked it up. I loved the no-BS approach he uses both in his books and his presentations. This guy ""GETS IT"" and you will too if you buy the book. But hey! Don't take my word for it, I'm just one of the many thousands of people who have bought the book.Mick Hager, author of MONKEY BUSINESS7 Laws of the Jungle for Becoming the Best of the Bunch!A Short Tale of a Company That Gets It! Gibbs Smith Publisher, March 2007"
1,Poor Quality CDs,#3 and 4 CDs could not be played on the computer.Note: This has nothing to do with Gitomer's content which is great(I have read the book.) It is strictly the poor grade of CD that did not allow me to play it on my computer. I had my IT person try to get both of them to work but it didn't happen.
5,Every salesperson needs this,"Practical, concise, and easy to read. I keep it with me at all times to make sure I am staying sharp."
4,Love it!,"I really love this book- and I say 'love' and not 'loved' because I will re-read it several times. The author makes it easy to understand and I couldn't help but laugh when he poked fun at bad salespeople. I of course resembled many a comment!But I agree with him, you have to constantly read and stay away from the TV to get better at anything. Many ideas and tips to follow.Good luck!"
2,Rah Rah without substance,"This book is one of dozens out there that should go in the motivation section rather than the sales section. If you need motivation, this book is great. But if you are looking for solid advice on how to improve your sales technique, don't waste your money. The book is littered with cute phrases like ""Kick your own ass"", and ""the more you love it, the more you will sell"".I bought the book because there are small nuggets of good information in it. I kept it because I know someday I will need motivation. But I quickly became tired of ""Rah-Rah, I'm the best salesman ever, and you suck unless you work harder."" Don't get me wrong, everyone could stand to work harder. But that wasn't what I was looking for.If you want motivation, read this book. If you want solid sales advice, read ""SPIN Selling"", or ""Soft Sell""."
1,Sizzle without the steak.....,"I bought this book in a moment of weakness. I'd had a rough prospecting day, was feeling down, and wondered into Barnes & Noble looking for something to cheer me up. The layout and feel of this book are great, they draw you in...but that's about it. When you delve into the material, you'll find it to be very shallow. Nothing new at all! In fact, it's a complete waste of time. I'm shocked to see all the good reviews."
3,Not intended for inside sales......,I bought this book because I work in a showroom designing and selling kitchens. I was looking for any tips that might help me close more sales. I found that the book was very informative but it didn't hold my attention because it was almost exclusively about how to be prepared for outside sales appointments and how to be successful making cold calls.
3,The Little Red Book of Selling,"The book is exciting and entertaining. But nothing different from the usual. Also, the techniques presented are too vague and lack a systematic approach. If interested on such topics SPIN selling by Huthwaite is probably the best book on the subject."
1,SALES BOOK FOR IDIOTS,The rest is basic + BS ..have a yes attitude not a no attitude ..wow ! he created oxygen ..ridiculous..
3,eh,"I have not exactly finished this book, mainly because the author kind of goes on and on before he ever gets to the point. I find myself skimming paragraphs and skipping pages in order to find what he is trying to get at. I suppose it is somewhat informative. If you are like me and like to read and get to the point quickly than it is not for you... If you like a lot of filler and explanations, then you will love it!"
5,The book that started it all,"This book inspired me to write my own book and publish my own blog. I highly recommend it to anyone in business, not just sales. This book is worth well over $100."
4,Very detailed story of the litigation,I enjoyed Sobol's presentation of the litigation story. He presented a thorough and well documented accountof the tragedy that was the Dalkon Shield.
5,Complex mass tort court resolution process,"Author spent much time following the court hearings and public exposed negotiations to write his outsider perception of a successful sophisticated ground breaking resolution through a unique use of the legal process to forge a social/economic plight suffered by thousands caught up in mass tort litigation. A great fast paced reading of court drama. That stated, the writing appears skewed by this author's cynical view of the legal system. We know now two decades later that the court resolution created set aside funds sufficient to make available 100% to the allowed claims through the mediation process developed."
2,"Exciting at times, dry at others","Unfortunately, I found it more dry then exciting. It helps to have a working knowledge of bankruptcy cases, but with this case so immense, the cast of characters grew so large and confusing I had to take notes to keep them straight. Probably the best resource out there that deals with the fallout of the Dalkon Shield case, but be forewarned, I emitted a cheer when I was finally through this."
4,This gave me some insight to women and orgasms.....,"I definitely enjoyed this video. It gave me quite a bit of insight to women's orgasms. I'm actually very knowledgeable in this area already, but it was nice to see a lot of what I already knew in the video, plus a few things I didn't know. The only ""flaw"" was that I think more time could have been spent on women talking about the actual techniques they use to bring themselves to orgasm. It's always good to know more in that particular area. ;)"
5,I am both honored and blessed to be part of this book,I cannot recommend this book highly enough to those who are struggling with returning or staying with the Catholic Church. At first I was flattered when the author asked to use a posting I made to the AOL boards. I struggled greatly at that time with my own journey from just practicing again to truly starting to live my faith. When I read the book myself I was deeply touched with the great care and sensitity shown by the author in handling this topic -- something I wish I had access to when I was first returning. I often recommended it to people I know who seem to be on the same journey.
4,amazing,i just love the images and all the book all together. its thick book with high quality. the only think that made me rate it 4 stars its before there is no clear explanation for each picture.
3,dPhilc's Review,"This is mainly a collection of prints. Each print appears to be well captioned. There is some expose of the ideas behind alchemy and mysticism, without giving too much away. If you are interested in art history or magick then this could be the book for you."
2,smaller than expected,"the book is too small for the beautifully colored plates to be of any value besides affording some general idea of what an alchemical illustration looks like. for the price, and considering the Taschen name, I expected a larger format book. nowhere on the description page does it say that the book is hardly 5 inches by 8 inches, which makes seeing any detail in the images nearly impossible."
4,Excellent reference for the serious student,"Contains excellent historical information for the student of both alchemy and mysticism. Well-written, it helps to have some previous knowledge of the terms. Not light reading. highly recommended"
2,Short version of the original book,"Why do I give this book only 2 stars? I don't agree with the way this book is marketed. Watch out for ordering this book, as there are two books of the same title, author and publisher. What's the difference? One of the books has the word 'icons' on it and has only 192 pages from the original book. The original book has 712 pages. Check that the ISBN's match for what you are after. I made the mistake of buying this book from a site that did not list the page numbers and went off the title, publisher, author and picture on the front cover. Since first writing this review, I have now returned to say that I have the original 712 paged book and am very happy with it. When it comes to a book like this, why settle for second best?"
5,Very good knife,"I like this knife. Nice made, good quality.Beautiful handle gives you a nice feel.Very happy with all LL Bean purchases."
5,Beautiful,This Knife was amazing! Beautiful handle and Brass it made a great gift for my father! would highly recommend!
4,Waited a long time to purchase,"Excellent finish...knife is too pretty to use! well balanced, hefty feel. edge could have been sharpened more carefully before shipping. very very fine all purpose woods knife"
1,"Beware of seller, no the knife itself","I've had and used these knives before and they are superb! This review should not be taken as a shot at the product itself, rather my very unpleasant experience with this seller's product. I had the item overnighted to me for a camping trip and was given a USED knife with clear wear marks on the hilt as well as machine marks on the blade. There was no paperwork in the box accompanying the knife, no warranty card, no packaging...just a knife and sheath. This was either a factory reject or, as I most strongly suspect, and outright counterfeit product. I have a hard time believing a genuine Buck knife could have left their factory with machine wear marks on their blades.Buyers beware of this seller!"
5,Quality Knife,"I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. It is very high quality, and quite beautiful. We are both looking forward to using it camping... however he claims its so nice he almost doesnt want to use it. But we will. Thank you!"
1,Would not play!,I purchased this and it would not play in my DVD or my friends DVD. We tried both Blu Ray and regular DVD. I was not going to waste my money returning it since I only paid about $10 for it. I have no idea what the problems was.
3,"60,s cult",not like 1967 but it brings back those memories of times gone by glad i have it to remind me of those times
3,Covers It.,I have nothing Negative to say about this CD or Group. It's a nice compilation and most of what one would want or remember about Blood Sweat & Tears is here!Blood Sweat & Tears - Greatest Hits
3,"Don't Have It, Don't Want It","I am lucky enough to have both of the BS&T first 2 albums, which comprise most or all of this, in both CD and Vinyl. From what I see in other reviews, some tracks are truncated, and the album only has 2 cuts from the first, and IMHO by far the better of the 2 albums. If you can find the originals, buy them, if not, you may have to settle for this."
3,Yearning for the horns that are missing,"In the late 60's a new rock sound came out thanks to Chicago and Blood Sweat & Tears. It was the sound of great horns taking the sounds of rock to new and uncharted regions. Chicago was and still is the greatest of em all. BS&T, would be #2. My question is, ""Why did the mixers or who ever take/limit the brass on this the Greatest Hits CD""? Don't get it. A couple of the songs are shorter on this CD, missing what you bought, or at least I did the orginal songs for, the horns, the brass the very thing that set BS&T and Chicago apart. Don't get me wrong, this is still a very good CD and all of BS&Ts best are to be found here, but they are found lacking. I enjoy this CD but it was not up to the way they were back in the day. David Clayton Thomas' voice still rings strong and beautiful. At the end of the day, this CD is still worthy of your collection."
5,Blood Sweat and Tears - Greatest Hits,"OK I admit to having been a fan of BST since the early 70s and it is wonderful to be able to obtain their albums again on CD instead of the old scratched vinyls that I have. The voice of David Clayton-Thomas soars amidst the totally inventive horn section and the band was, to my mind at least, the most powerful and musically innovative outfit of their decade. How I wish they had recorded much much more !"
2,"Not Enough Songs + Wrong Song Versions,","No one with any sense should buy this CD. Why settle for so few songs, and the shortened versions of the songs to boot! Try ""What Goes Up: The Best of Blood, Sweat & Tears"" instead."
5,A FAVORITE FROM LONG AGO,"All their greatest hits that are played on the radio today including SPINNING WHEEL, GOD BLESS THE CHILD and a few more from the 60's too."
5,"Review of Blood, Sweat and Tears Greatest Hits",Blood Sweat & Tears - Greatest HitsThis purchase was a gift for my brother for Christmas and I own this CD myself. This is a great CD.
3,OK.,"This CD was ok. some of the songs I didn't remember. Sound quality is good. However, ""God Bless The Child"" is still one of their greatest."
1,Why cut out the solos?,"One of the greatest horn sections of the seventies was basically raped by the re-issue of this greatest hits compilation. I have the earlier version (with original album cuts), and the songs are just amazing. The horn breakdowns on Lucrecia McEvil, God Bless the Child, and Spinning Wheel are the most impressing parts of the music. My fear is that new fans will miss those important elements of B,S,&T's music."
5,Sylvania L151 Flat panel Display,"We bought the display at a local store (Costco) for a good price, and had it set up in just a few minutes -- a truly very easy ""plug & play"" process! It replaces a 17-inch CRT, and we -- myself, my wife, and our adult daughter -- are very happy in every respect. The controls over the display are quite easy to use, and we find the picture quality -- colors, contrast, clarity, etc. -- to be very good for both graphics and text.The savings on desktop space are outstanding!"
1,Sylvania SF150 user Review,"I purchased this monitor as a replaced for an old regular17' generic ""GEM monitor. To my surprise when I set it withthe resolution set as default at 800x600 the image qualitywas so poor that I had to switch to 1024x768 immediatelyjust to get a decent picture out of this monitor. Mind youthat my video card is a Radeon 7200 with 64MB, and cansupport up to 2048x1536. I contacted their customersupport, and the final word is not out yet. Depending ontheir ability to restore my faith I might have to returnthis monitor. I expected much better performancefor a LCD monitor than what I am getting. This productmakes my old 17' regular monitor look good, that shouldnot have been the case.CesarTechnical Support Engineer"
5,"Prophecies of Daniel, excellent",An excellent explanation and study of of the book of Daniel. I read it along with the CD program with Dr. Jeremiah.
5,Handwriting On The Wall is worth it's weight in gold! (And that's alot right now.),Great Book. I got it to compliment a Beth Moore study we are doing on the book of Daniel. I love the way he delivers his facts with confidence. So few people seem to have confidence in what they believe today. We need to know what God wants us to know...to really understand it. This book explains concepts in detail while making it easy to understand. It also ties the past to our present and future. We can be certain of what is to come because we can look back and see -in great detail- what was already prophesied that is now history to us.
4,JAZZ not for the WEAK of Heart,"Joni has produced what I would consider a truly FINE jazz album. If you are looking for typical JM, then pass on this one. But if you want some smooth, satisfying, slinky, sounds--order it now."
2,Was expecting much more,With the amount of talent put together here I was expecting something mind blowing. Boy was I disappointed. What a shame.
1,Very Disappointing,"Slow, repetitive music that bears no resemblance to anything Mingus wrote or performed. My only question....how can I unload this album?"
1,Unlistenable,I am a Joni Mitchell fan and a Charles Mingus fan. I find this album unlistenable. It is very unlike Joni Mitchell's other albums and it also is not up to the same standards of jazz performance that Mingus' other albums are.
2,Embarrassing,"According to the liner notes, Joni Mitchell was asked by Charles Mingus to put lyrics to some of his tunes. That's what she should have attempted to do; she should have attempted to put straight lyrics to them, NOT lyrics ABOUT Mingus, and she should have attempted to sing them straight and not sing ""jazz"". I don't say she's hopeless as a jazz singer, but if she wanted to sing jazz, she should have recorded an album of standards (standards that already had lyrics, that is).The musicians here do a fine job, especially Jaco and Herbie (some great horn arranging by Jaco, by the way), but that's the accompaniment. Joni's lyrics are embarrassing and her singing seems pretentious and phony.In any case, this record simply doesn't work, and it ain't a-happening--which is why it was received unfavorably in its day and continues to be received unfavorably (except by Internet fetishists), to the extent it isn't ignored completely."
2,Don't buy it!,"Seldom I listen to this Cd, most of the songs are boring, slow ballads. Only song I like is ""Dry Cleaner..."". Jaco's Bass lines are fine, but go for any other of Joni's Album, e.g. ""Shadows and Light"" to hear some better ones. Don't buy it!"
1,I hated this record,"I hated this record. It was nothing at all like I expected when I heard it. I really dislike the jazz style of Mingus (give me Miles ANY DAY) and Joni did not make this music ""hers"". While I applaud her bravery in making this record, the results are a mess. As a Joni Mitchell record, this is not good. As a Mingus record... let the Mingus fans judge that."
3,Jaco the Great.,"I never liked Joni Mitchell. I just don't like her voice or her music. This album didn't make me like her more. The only reason I bought it is Jaco Pastorius, who plays bass here. I wasn't dissappointed, his playing is as good, as inspiering and as educating as always.However, it's not a very good Jazz album. Mitchell has grouped together some of her time's finest Jazz cats. Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shoter, Jaco. However, except for Jaco, none of this guys don't get to really show what he can do. Joni pretendes to be a jazz singer, which she ain't, and her voice kills every drop of jazz around.Mingus' tunes are as good as always, but I think that without Joni Mitchell it would've been a much better album. I also think that if they'd put in more tunes, in addition, or instead most of the spoken parts, it could've been better."
4,A fine line between genius and bad!,"Were it not for the first track on this album, I might well have rated it a ""5"". Mitchell & Mingus come together in a beautiful union of musical genius. Mitchell's love for alternate tunings allows a range of sounds from the familiar guitar, to create a less familiar musical palate.The songs on here are phenomenal. It's just that dang ""Happy Birthday"" that I have a problem with. I fail to see any reason that this was included. And if there was some sort of artistic statement being given by the artists, I would have understood it on the last track. But the beginning? It is silly and out of place.Once you get past this part, you'll likely find this album a treasure chest of musical perfection."
5,Jaco + Joni...elegant and sharp!!,Man....The art of improvisation....felt deep within the soul..then played. Joni touched us deep with her poetic wisdom and wit. Jaco's playing with Joni is exceptional! Jaco fans will enjoy this one. If your a student of the Bass pick this one up. Bass players and musicians who grew up during the 70's will appreciate the groove and art of Jaco's playing and Joni's messages. Enjoy.
4,An important record in the Jaco Pastorius discography,"The way Jaco phrases along the record is a rare exhibition of his fabulous ear for orchestration and harmony. I am sure he put a lot of himself into this project, and given enough space by Joni. In fact, an in life tribute to Mingus in which Joni chose Jaco as bassist is a remarkable fact."
5,A Beautiful Tribute.,"This is an incredible album featuring not only a stellar line up but also world class vocal versions of tunes from one of the greatest jazzmen ever. The focus here is on the compoisitional structure of the tunes themselves and Mitchell's voice, not the chops of the instrumentalists (though this does not mean they hold back). I recommend this album to every Mingus, Mitchell or jazz listener out there."
3,Difficult for someone who dislikes punk,"I hate punk. Let's get that clear from the start.That said, this is not exactly punk, to my ears. There is far and away much more musicality going on here than in punk music I am used to hearing.I like the record's political leanings, but for someone who is more into 'groove-based' music, a lot of ""London Calling"" is not really my style.There are several songs I really enjoy, however, starting with the title track. ""Rudie Can't Fail"" is a nice slice of mutant-reggae, and my favorite, ""Guns of Brixton"" has been described perfectly elsewhere as ""a dread-sick skank,"" which also satisfies my reggae jones.Someone once described The Clash to me as 'punk-meets-reggae.' My thought is that there was too much punk and not enough reggae.It's certainly worth multiple listens, however."
5,Simply the Best,"The Clash simply epitomize the meaning of the genre ""punk"" better than almost everyone, and the Sex Pistols are the only band that is even considered an equal. This album is one of the biggest and best of the last 30 years. Enough said."
4,hated it in 1979...love it decades later,"When this came out other than ""London Calling"" and ""Clampdown"" I wondered if the Clash had lost the plot. I was never into ""Police And Thieves"" punk reggae and they went crazy here on this album with ""Revolution Rock"" and ""The Guns of Brixton"" and ""Rudie Can't Fail"" (although the latter is more ska-ish). Throw in the mixes of sounds from what sounds like lounge hitting the pub sounds of the '80s...well, ""we"" (as in the collective punk us) absolutely thought the Clash had sold out.Boy, was I wrong! Years later it is my fave Clash LP because it's varied unlike the first two which are straight punk (still great LPs but come on!)."
3,Stick with the original version,"I was quite disappointed by this. The original album is amazing. The added bonuses do nothing to enhance the experience. The DVD interviews are just recycled from the ""Westway to the World"" DVD, except for those with Kosmo Vinyl. The Vanilla Tapes are just rough, rough demos. Interesting to hear, but be honest, how many times are you actually going to listen to them? Due to the fact that there aren't any new interviews with Jonesy, Simmo, or Topper, I'm lead to believe that this was just a way for Sony to cash in on the 25th anniversary. VFM goes out the window. Definitely not worth the price. Stick with the plain Jane version, unless you're an EXTREME Clash fan."
4,Classic album,"This is a great package with the original album and a DVD.Thirty years after its release, the album itself is no mystery. London Calling is a timeless classic. Even today, it stills sounds fresh, lively, and relevant. Not many other records from the late 70's and 1980's can make this claim. The band pushes way beyond its punk roots, yet still keeps a sharp political edge to the lyrics.The DVD is mostly interesting for including footage of the band in the studio--you can see for yourself how crazy Guy Stevens was--and videos for London Calling, Train in Vain, and Clampdown, as well as a Don Letts documentary.So, 4 stars. If the DVD had additional live footage of the Clash from the period, this would be a 5 star package. If you're a diehard fan or a completist, look around for the 3-disc 25th Anniversary Edition. It has a full disc of demo versions and most of the video that's in the 30th Anniversary Edition."
4,Nevermind the who?,"This album shows why the clash are the best punk band of all time(certaintly the most talented and varied). It is a riveting epic from start to finish. My personal favorites here are ''The guns of brixton'', ''Spanish bombs'', and ''Wrong 'em boyo''."
5,DON'T WORK FOR THE CLAMPDOWN,Clampdown...the motto of my life. Hands down favorite album of all time
5,yup!,"Hmph. If the title track and Death or Glory are the only things that stand out to the previous reviewer, he or she clearly needs to listen to the album a few more times. I won't say I'm fanatical about every track here (it kinda drags a tidge on the second half, I feel), but how can you argue with Hateful, Rudie Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Guns of Brixton, Clampdown, and many more? If you want to here punk in its purest form, you should listen to the Clash's first album (which outstrips Never Mind the Bullocks by miles), but as a pure musical statement, nothing beats London Calling."
5,Blew me away,"I'm the type of person that always finds a lot of those albums on ""Top 100"" lists always terribly overrated. I went out and bought this album and it was actually my first Clash album. From the first listen on, it totally blew me away. I went about a month where I listened to it at least twice a day, I thought it was just so great. No matter how many times I listen to it, it still sounds fresh and new every time. There is just something so MAGICAL about this album, you can't really describe it, you just have to get the album and you'll instantly know what everyone is talking about. If you like music, any kind of music at all, do yourself a favor and go out and get this masterpiece."
3,"Awesome album, crappy remaster","I replaced my original release cd with this remaster and gave away my original to a friend. Tragically, some dope in the control room, as well as every subsequent jerk at the record label, did not hear the damage done to the elevator bell in the beginning of Koka Kola.How can it be that the best album ever by the best band ever be treated like this? Later, a new remaster was released as a double cd with other material never before available. Did they fix the problem from the first remaster??? NO.I can't tell you not to buy it if you don't own it because it is a must have for any cd collection to be complete, but write a letter to the jerks at the record label and demand more respect for the Clash!!!Major labels complain about how much money they are loosing to piraters, etc, then they release material without any apparent quality control. Tell Rod Rooter this is not acceptable!"
4,Great rock record,"To me this is an awesome rock record by a great punk band. They were able to transition from fast pissed off punk to a more subtle atmospheric rock sound in less than two years. While i would get the self-titled alum first i would get give em enough rope second so you can see how they were begining to trasition and ultimately write london calling which is a sort of concept album in itself. Best songs: "" hateful"", ""rudy cant fail"", ""lost in the supermarket"", and "" guns of brixton"""
2,Sony / Epic Strikes (out) Again,"Once again, we are left with the same crappy remaster as the 25th anniversary edition. Something so easy to fix is apparently beyond the morons at Sony. A minor detail to be sure but, the bell at the beginning of Koka Kola is screwed up. Instead of the ""ding"" of the elevator bell, we get ""dowing"", the sound of some idiot that bumped the tape during transfer. Buy the old, un-remastered version and boost the volume up yourself.I would give it only one star, but the music is just too good. Sony rots, don't buy it."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"I made the mistake of believing this was going to be a punk record. However, when i listened to it i discovered that it was a little bit of punk and a lot of ska,rockabilly,and other genres. It's not a bad record... but it just doesnt seem to have that certain something that makes it a great album. I feel a little bit guilty about not loving this album. It seems as if everyone is in love with it and i am the only person thats not. There are some good tracks such as Lost in the Supermarket, Train in Vain, Brand New Cadillac, and obviously London Calling.This is not a bad album... in fact it is pretty good. However, i just cant find the greatness in it. None the less, it is worth buying and who knows... mabye you will love it."
3,"Rock record, not PUNK","Great rock n roll songs, but I had heard it was the Clash's best album. No. If you want rock buy this album, but if you're looking for Clash PUNK buy The Clash, or Give em Enough Rope. Must note that the lyrics on this album are very exceptional, check out ""Clampdown""."
2,Honest opinion...,"I don't know why this album is so highly praised amongst these guys' other CDs. Spanish Bombs as well as London Calling are very good songs, however, most of this album is quite BORING. No speed, no pissed snotty vocals, what gives? Hearing crap like Lovers Rock makes me go ape$H*t."
3,.....I Don't Get It,"Actually 3 1/2 stars .The Clash' third album London Calling is possibly the most overated album of all time . I understand if you're into punk you want a claim in rock and roll history , but most of the songs on this album are hardly punk . The bulk of the album is reggae or reggae influenced . The title song is great , Brand New Cadillac ( a cover of a Vince Taylor song ) is great too . Ditto for Lost In A Supermarket , a song that sounds like something from Genesis' Duke period . Spanish Bombs , Hateful and Clampdown are good too . There are 18 tracks on this album .What are the other standout songs ? I don't hear 'em . I would think that "" one of the great albums of all time "" would be solid from top to bottom . The bulk of this album is mediocre pop/ reggae songs . Where's the edge ? I don't hear it . This is one of those albums like Exile On Main Street that's cool too like ... possibly because the critics say so ?"
5,Cool Album,Really enjoyed the diversity yet intensity. These guys can rock hard without screaming their way to lung cancer. Well done! Recomeneded for any flexible classic punk fan. Not all punk is served raw powerful and full of oi!
5,One of the best albums ever!,"This is one of the best ablums ever!!!!.... out of the 18 songs, only 2 are just ok..... If I were stuck on an island with 50 albums, this would be there for sure!!enjoy!"
5,Punk Classic II,"The Clash's followup to their debut is a classic. This album has so many political messages it should be listen too. They have broaden their sound and this album has a mixture between punk rock and reggae which is used very brillantly throughout this album. Favorites include London Calling, Jimmy Jazz, Rudie Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Lost in the Supermarket, Guns of Brixton, Death or Glory, Koka Kola, Four Horsemen, and the pop crossover hit Train in Vain. Highly Highly Recommended."
5,A real winner,"Like everyone else, I think this is one of the best albums ever. The newly remastered version sounds much, much better than the original release on CD."
5,"Quite simply, the greatest rock record of all time!","This record is bloody well brilliant. After all these years, it's still the finest record I've ever listened to. The diversity of sound on this album (everything from rockabilly, pop, ska, reggae, hard rock, punk), the themes, the wonderful politics of the record, even the awesome cover are exciting. Right up there and surpassing Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Led Zep IV, and Exile On...The record you MUST own."
5,Best album ever!,"Every track is bigger than life!! This IS best album ever, I know it, even I've listened albums like 'Selling England by Pound' and 'Led Zeppelin IV'. Everybody should buy it!! Even if you have it already ;)"
5,Understanding Western Culture - last half of the 20th Cen.,"London Calling, Who's Next, Allman Brothers - the Fillmore Concerts, Buffalo Springfield Again, Abby Road, Dark Side of the MoonStart there..."
5,Album of the Decade,"Everything has already been said here, but I just wanted to add my voice.This might not be THE best rock album of the 1970's, but if not then it's dam close!If you already have it, put it on. If not, buy it NOW.Cheers!"
5,way-underrated,London calling is one of the best punk albums along with the combat rock album containing the excellent rock the casbah.An essential classic to have in your collection.five stars.
1,This Is Dreadful..,"Perhaps my musical standards are too high, but this such a dissapointing LP words can hardly describe my disgust. The title track is passable but the remainder is a jumbled,ametuerish mess!Joe Strummer and company were crude, sloppy, untalented 'musicians' who couldn't carry a tune with handles and their attempts at incorporating dance, jazz and reggae into this waste of disc space is laughable at best. Why this is heralded as one of the greatest rock/punk albums of all time is truly a mystery to me. I just wasn't impressed or moved at all. My favorite part of ""London Calling""? Returning it to the music store for a refund. Don't believe the hype."
1,London Calling,"The cover is suitable for framing. The content is suitable for forgetting. ""Train In Vain"" is good, but it can't save the entire album."
1,im so cool cuz im punk,blink 182? good charlotte? the clash?isnt it all the same 3 chord pop nonsensefashioncore mall pansys with hot topic gift cards
1,"This album reeks, listen to the sex pistols","From London Calling to train in vain, i am ashamed to hear that this band were the definite uk punkers. These guys rely on catchy tones rather than playing their hearts out. To find the REAL definite UK punkers, listen to the sex pistols"
5,"""Smash up your seats, and rock to this brand new beat...!""","This third album by The Clash, originally released in the US in 1980, was voted Best Album of the 80's by Rolling Stone readers. It's easy to see why, though it's hard to think of it as a 80's album, since it actually came out in England in 1979.'London Calling' was a double album - and it justified that format, being full of such strong material. Reggae, country and rock'n'roll influences can all be found - proving that, unlike many of their punk counterparts, The Clash were musically open-minded and ready to integrate new styles into their music.This also contains what is possibly the first 'secret track' on vinyl - 'Train in Vain', which wasn't listed on the original LP sleeve."
3,Memorable,"This album is O.K. - although I don't think it's a classic, I don't think it's resale bin material either. On the contrary, regardless of what the self-serving writers at Rolling Stone think, this wasn't the best album of the 70s (""Rumours"" was) or the 80s (""Joshua Tree"" was). Additionally, it isn't even the best of 1979.As for the music, ""Train in Vain"" is great, but there are too many ""skip-over"" tracks to rate this better than 3-stars."
1,Crap,"I bought this album about last year. I'd been told for years that this album was a masterpiece and so on. When I heard it I kind of liked the opening song, except for the disrespectful remark about the beatles. But when I heard the rest, I had never been so dissapointed in my life. This is [...] music for [...] new wave fans."
3,"Tries to hard for mainstream acceptance, it's okay.","London Calling was the third album from the Clash. This time they tried to be different. The problem I have with this disc that it tries too hard. Tries to be different and streches too far from the band's musical limits and abilities. It's also highly overrated. Whenever people talk about the Clash they always bring up this one, their first sell-out album.Recommended for ""Combat Rock"" Clash fans."
3,Good but not the best.Thats Sgt Pepper of course!,"Very good CD,lots of intelligent,wistfull music and lyrics plus one of the best songs of the seventies,""London Calling"".I admire the Clash and their Music even withstanding their attitude towards the Beatles,though they didnt hate them as much as those talentless pistols.Didnt they fire a member because he admitted he liked them? Anyway if you like reggae,punk,ska or just good earthy rock n roll this CD is highly recommended.As for being the best ever,it's impossible cause the top 13 are Beatles CD's. But it's definately among the top 100 of all time."
3,not up to the politics its made out to be,"What is best about this album is the playful songs. they sound like they were fun to sing, and are fun to sing along to. What is missing is a hardline message about a stance in the world. The clash are a band that came up while punk was coming up, under the guise of a political band. I admire and respect their political tracks, songs with messages, such as london's burning, or koka kola, but by putting other songs on the same album, such as spanish bombs, and rudy can't fail, you can't help but wonder whether they were better of trying to play the politics card, or should have stuck to playful, but still entertaining lyrics."
2,Sorry but it is kind of overrated,"I bought this album because, well, I heard it was one of the hands down best rock albums ever produced. The Clash even had the title ""The only band that matters"". I dunno. I won't launch into a diatribe of what is or what isn't punk rock, but I just don't find London Calling a very meaty offering, and I like my music to have meat.There are some good songs, but this album is 19 TRACKS TOO LONG and many of the songs are forgettable, fast forwardable filler. Its nice that the Clash were doing something different other than the straight ahead three chord punk bands, but musicianship wise, they just sound so timid.I dunno, just my opinion"
3,Kinda good but they be ripping off pink floyd,This album is good but they be ripping old sounds from Pink Floyd. This is a good album no doubt but eh...not that much. I would recommend some Pink Floyd albums better than this boring drivel...
5,Amazing,This album has something for everyone. A lot of emotion and creative energy. BUY THIS ALBUM!
4,Stop answering the phone,"Innovative punk fusion at its finest, filled with minor transcendence, spectacular diversity, and renegade heart. Play this for solace when any overly-hyped UK buzz band hangs incessantly over your ears."
5,one of my favs,"i beg you to buy this. it is so good. it's much better than the commercial crap of today's music polluted by pop acts like rage against the machine, korn, blink 182, nsync, backstret boys, juvenile, and britney spears. those bands are fake. this is music coming from the CLASH's heart, not some rich business men behind the aforementioned bands. buy this now or you will never experience good music."
5,"A ""Clash""-ic","When I first heard this album, I admit I didn't like it. For all the talk about the Clash being one of the first punk bands, this album didn't really sound that punk. It wasn't until later that I realised therein lies it's genius. For a bunch of punks, The Clash were amazing songwriters and could actually play their instruments fairly well (cue Simonon's wicked bass runs in the title track)."
5,My favorite album of all time,"Hey, who else but The Clash would rhyme ""feckless"" with ""breakfast?"" Absolutely brilliant. It doesn't get any better than this."
4,"a ""most have"" for every rock and roll kid","I got this cd from my uncle for christmas. This was a couple days after joe's unfortunate death. I think the clash had a lot of potential and are a influence on any rock group. ""London calling"", "" Lost in the supermarket"" and "" Clampdown"" and great classical punk songs that will never fade through out the years. The clash aren't as exciting as the sex pistols or misfits but they right classical punk rock. Just plug this LP in your stereo and relax to the creativeness of the Clash"
5,The Clash - the only band that mattered!,"London Calling - the bands flagship work is and always will be a masterpeice. Approaching it's twenty year anniversary, this album still inspires me. How many other recordings that took place in 1979 can you say that about.And to think - no reunion tour!"
2,buyer beware,"This laser is not what it is advertised . The ad states that the laser is accurate to within 3/32 of an inch in 100 ft . It is not . It is only accurate to 3/32 of an inch in 30 ft .That is a full 2/3 less then what amazon advertises. This is the information you get when you acctualy recieve the laser from amazon . They also list it as the m2xlt without the detector . That is not the correct model number . When i brought this to amazons attention , they told me since i bought it from one of their merchants they had no liability ."
5,For the Reader's Workshop Novice,"For the Reader's Workshop novice this is the book for you... and the second grade teacher of course! I cannot believe how much my students' and my colleagues students' learned from the lessons we created. The book does a really good job of laying out each day along with the goals for the day, week and unit. The only trouble we had was finding all of the books mentioned since many are out of publication. Thanks for a great book ladies!!"
3,"Pathways to Change, second ed., Brief therapy with difficulty adolescents","Ok, has strategies for family therapy. Was looking more for strategies for adolescents only."
2,a skeptical look at Dennis Lee's claims of free energy,"This tape includes a lot of Dennis talking of a massive intergenerational and international conspiracy to stop free energy. It also has very detailed theory (which would violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics). The tape does mention a small part of Dennis's criminal record to date - but nothing of the skeptical point of view about Dennis available on the internet. As of 8/99, Dennis has still not made good on his promise to demonstrate machines (which are now said to be different from the ones on the tape)"
1,All Smoke and mirrors.,"Dennis Lee, as usual, gives a lot of promises and no real proof of the machine which he is trying to market. If you go to some Search Engines, and type in the words ERIC KRIEG, you will get a lot more information about Dennis Lee's machine."
4,Pretty Good,This is a great book for students who ned reading review. It's a little cumbersome to photocopy. That's my only complaint.
5,Breakthrough,"This man is so gifted and God is using him mightly,any time i played any of his music,which i have few of his CD,the words are so prayerful and soul uplifting that you are transformed and happy.God bless you and annoit you daily with fresh annoiting from the throne of Grace."
4,Never Gonna Stop w/ Tommy Walker,"Tommy Walker is a great praise and worship leader. I don't hear much about him in the praise and worship industry though. I first learned a little about him through this CD. Because of this CD, I ended up purchasing more CDs by him. He is also a gifted musician and singer. My favorite song on this CD is, ""He knows my name."" I listened to that song one day when I was having a bad day and it just totally ministered to my spirit.Praise and worship fans don't sleep on many of the songs on this one."
3,Big Band Nostalgia for Midwesterners,The sound quality may not be perfect (it was recorded from radio) but this CD will be a nostalgic treat for those (like my mother) who remember when Tiny Hill played the big dance halls of the Midwest during World War II.
3,"good, but not great.","I assume, one of his earier works.Don't get me wrong, it's fine. But, 'Learning to Flinch' will always be my favorite."
5,zevon's best work,"the ""lesser"" tracks are surprisingly rich -- lyrically, especially. as i grow old with this album i find myself less interested in werewolves and more taken by such songs as switching yard, roland and the more melodic pieces."
4,Warren Zevon vinyl,Thank you very much. Shipping was very fast. Vinyl and sleeve in condition described. Would recommend this seller.
5,Zevon,"I originally bought Excitable Boy on vinyl and needed a CD for my car. If you're a fan of Warren Zevon, you know the genius he is goes way beyond his most recognizable hit, ""Werewolves of London."""
4,zevon exitable boy,"This was the firat album I ever heard on Warren Zevon, I have been hookedsince.This album I think is also is his best because the whole album really flows well from beginning to end.It has on it some of the most unforgettable songs such as ""excitable boy"" and ""Roland the Thompson gunner"".One thing you will say about Mr Zevon he was original, which in myhumble opinion is the highst praise one can get in the ""pre packaged""music industry......"
5,Great album now sounds even better,"Most of you reading this should already know how good this album is. I bought this remastered version to enjoy the improvement in sound quality and wasn't disapointed. I usually do not like other tracks tacked on to the end of the original tracks, but in this case I enjoyed all of them, especially the alternate version of ""Werewolves of London"". Ialmost like it more than the originally released version on the album !The liner notes are also excellent, giving some interesting insights into the man himself, as well as his music.Now all I want is his 1976 self-titled album to be REMASTERED too."
5,"Poetic, Brilliant, Masterful","It's time for me to thank Judy Collins. Actually, the gratitude is way overdue. JUDITH was originally released when I was 15. I was hooked on it for many years, and am again hooked on it as an adult. On the 1 to 5 star scale, this album really deserves a six! The lyrics, the arrangements and the voice combine to create a poetic delight. My favorite Judy Collins penned song from this album is ""Houses."" The choices in tracks not written by Judy Collins are fantastic, particularly Webb's ""The Moon's a Harsh Mistress."" This is an album to play over and over. Put the CD in your machine and hit the repeat button. Thank you Judy."
4,Good insight for teens,"I enjoyed reading this as it had a different approach on the subject of marriage than most other books. The author first challenges the reader to live up to specific standards before even beginning to date/court. It certainly convicted me to work on areas in my life before beginning any relationship. The author presents a lot of lists throughout: reasons to get married, people you should avoid, etc. I found the most insightful was reasons not to get married, which talked honestly about unhealthy (and ultimately stupid) reasons for getting married. My only reservation is that this book is definitely written for teens, not so much for someone in their 20s like myself. I occasionally found myself bored with the cheesy relationship scenarios, but if you're a younger teen, this book offers good biblical advice about preparing yourself for marriage."
3,Anchor Hocking Presence 3-Tier Platter Set,"I had planned a Christmas event that included mini desserts. These tiered platters were great for that. However, I was very disappointed that the packaging did not have a clear and written warning HANDWASH ONLY. I placed the smaller one in the dishwasher; the heat of the dishwasher unglued the top from the base. Doesn't stay together now."
5,Gorgeous and very affordable!,"I just received my 3 tier platter to be used to display cupcakes and what a beautiful set! I ordered this on Monday and got it today (Friday) and I live in Hawaii! I have checked out MANY similar products and none of them come close for the price. I was about to purchase the styrofoam set for $18 but decided against it. Three reasons to purchase 1. great price 2. it's made of durable, heavy glass 3. the tiers can be used separately. It's not one piece."
2,Nice but arrived shattered.,Anchor Hocking Presence 3 TierPlease improve your packaging. The large tier arrived shattered.This was for my daughter's first birthday. When I opened thepackage pieces of glass debris came out. Very dangerous scatteringon the floor specially when there is a toddler around.Returned and opted for the 3 Tier platic Wilton set.
1,never even got to see them...,"I bought this 3 tier platter set as a Christmas present. I never even got to give it. They were broken before they got to me, I called customer care and they were very helpful and offered to rush deliver a new set to me at no cost. 2 weeks later I got a refund in my bank and no present."
1,Dissappointed,I really wanted this set and this was the only site that I was able to find it. My shippment was received shattered because no padding was included in the box. I was sent two replacements after that with no padding and they were shattered also. I have finally given up and accepted a refund.
2,Hoped for the best to no avail....,"I read the multiple reviews about the poor packaging and how these arrived broken for many people. I decided to take a chance because I really needed these ASAP for a party this weekend. Well, add me to the list of annoyed consumers. I ordered two of these and both sets arrived completely shattered to bits. I am very disappointed that Amazon hasn't gotten the memo after reading all these negative reviews about the poor packing. Plus, I must add that these are pretty cheaply made in general. I am sure they look fine with food on them, but I would recommend that you keep your expectations low as far as the quality is concerned. Waiting to hear back from Amazon about replacements."
2,Disappointment,I returned this item because it's made cheaply. Each 'tier' is made from two pieces - the plate and base - and are cheaply glued together. It wasn't glued on straight and the glue was smeared.
3,Like it but poor workmanship,"Upon opening package (well packaged), the largest tier is scratched, has a large very noticeable bubble in it and there is a very prominent ring in the glass where the footing is attached to the platter. Not so in the two smaller tiers, which are beautiful. Since I got such a deal on this (I watched until the price went way down and jumped on it), I will likely keep it - after all it will have hors d' on top of it so likely it will never be seen. But if giving as a gift, I would order with plenty of lead time (in case you need to return it) and would open it and inspect it carefully upon receipt before gifting. Certainly not worthy of Anchor Hocking products, which are usually made well, and look very nice."
5,great!!!!,"i finished one bottle, and just rec'd my book.i'd had a stroke and cannot do must exercise. this is great!!!!"
2,Blech!,Recipes were awful! There are much better vinegar books out there if you take a look. This one just isn't it.
4,apple cider vinegar - weight loss,I bought apple cider vinegar 1 month ago and it seems that i have not lost a single pound. I thought it would eliminate my body fats but it doesnt.
5,Thanks to Harry!,"Dear Harry,I would like to thank you for your gift on the occassion of my 30th birthday. You clown! I received the diet book written by Klaus Oberbeil and was really doubting our relationship until I realized that you really do love me and that you want me to look my best. Well, as you very well know, I have dropped 20 pounds in 4 months all due to reading the instructions in the book which encouraged me to ear properly and excercise more regulary.I cannot wait to see you again. You will notice that there is less of me to see more often!Thank you Bob and Klaus!"
5,Great For Fans,"These are great classic episodes for die hard fans. These Include the episodes Sick Daze, Ring Masters, The Poké-Spokesman, Control Freak, The Art of Pokemon, The Heartbreak of Brock, and Current Events. One of my favorite episodes is Control Freak. Jessie finds a mask in an underground buried temple. This gives her the Power to control Pokemon. Which is cool, but it only worked where the queen reigned. Brocks Golbat helps get it back by evolving into Crobat. I also like Current Events where Ash's Chikorita finally evolves into Bayleaf after seeing Ash getting beat up by Arbok and Victreebel."
1,Purfect Prank,"I bought a copy of the book this calendar is based on for myself and a copy for a friend. I'm not going to give the copy to my friend and I don't really know what to do with the one I have. It's not because I'm offended at the idea of people painting cats if it's humanely done. I just feel ripped off. I bought the book because it was quirky and pretty. While the pictures are still lovely, apparently they're all done in photoshop. There is no disclaimer on the book anywhere, and while I'm sort of glad that people aren't really painting cats, (though apparently the book is inspiring people to paint cats because a lot of people don't realise it's a hoax) I can mock up pictures of painted cats in photoshop all on my own. This book isn't an oddity of human nature, it's a fraud that doesn't have the decency to let you know that. You have to first buy it and then figure it out for yourself. I want my money back."
1,definitely NOT for a cat lover,"Once I ordered this by mistake, butI promptly returned it. I found itoffensive, distasteful and cruelto apply paint to cats, regardlessof what cultures or cults may havepracticed this. Too many of today's""artists"" are trying to cash in onshock value..."
2,Médiocre par rapport à la BD,Presque tout est dit dans le titre de mon commentaire. J'avais acheté le DVD il y a environ 10 ans et non seulement les raccourcis sont grotesques par rapport à la BD mais les voix américaines sont pitoyables. Seule utilité: j'ai pu parfaire un peu mon anglais... pour un vocabulaire qui me sera sans doute peu utile...
5,get down boogie oogie oogie,"okay a taste of honey is a few of disco groups i like, distant has a funky vibe to it, and if we loved is one of my favorite ballads, sukiyaki is on here a song used by a million rappers, rescue me was sampled by positive k, and the funky 4 plus 1, sky high has nice lyrics this was no oridinary disco group unklike other talentless divas these girls use melodies, and instruments, still love it."
5,My Favorite Record,"I was once asked ""Are you going to listen to ""The Clash"" when you get home from work? ""What do you mean?"" I replied. ""Well, you used to put it on the turntable everyday after work."" It's true, I was and still am obsessed with this album. And why not? It is only the greatest rock and roll record of all time.Listen to the bass and the back-up vocals and then you will know what I am talking about.This original version is finally available here in The States. Get it now and don't be fooled by the much inferior U.S version."
4,"Just started listening to the Clash, not a big fan of punk","I just recently started listening to the Clash. And I love this f'ing CD. It's sheer intensity is what makes this album so brilliant. Favorite Tracks: White Riot, Police & Thieves, Deny, and especially I'm So Bored with the USA. A must have and a classic for any fan of Rock n' Roll"
5,YEAH!,"ALRIGHT! Now this is what i call a PUNK album. EVERY single song in this album are really good. My favorites are CHEAT, DENY, REMOTE CONTROL, CAREER OPPORTUNITIES, 48 HOURS, WHAT'S MY NAME, and LONDON'S BURNING. I really recommend this album and the US version of this album. And also buy other CLASH albums, they're great!"
5,how to make a six star recording,"Buy this c.d. and burn it onto a disc with the pre-rope singles from 78-79.... White Riot (single version), 1977, capitol radio one, complete control, city of the dead, clash city rockers, jail guitar doors, white man in hammersmith (palais), and the prisoner. Total clock time = 60.75 minutes! If the label were to market such a product I would by the album again. What you would have is the greatest pure-punk release ever. Period. Without the singles you have the greatest punk album ever, however at only 35 minutes its a shame you will have to buy the box set or three other c.d.s to compile the complete singles w/ the sometimes classic b-sides intact."
2,Disappointed,"Not at all what I was hoping for. I'm big on single player, first person shooters that follow a deep story line like Quake did. This is all mission based with no save or game story progress to follow. It's basically like playing an online multi-player game by yourself. Aside from the fact that this ruins it for me, those who like this kind of game are in for a treat. Lots of controls (every key on the keyboard and mouse are bound to some function, selection or action) and the graphics are very good while not over demanding on your hardware. I'm using a G-Force 9500 GT and was able to crank up all graphic settings to their maximum values while running at 1920x1080 deff. It is however a very nice collectors box for those of you who like to collect PC games. Just don't expect a good single player/story based experience."
2,Bad product,"Cheap and worn out too quickly, cheaper and better quality can be purchase at local walgreen, CVS, HEB and kroger stores. Wasted my money !!!"
5,Great Bio,"If you're into pop bands, this is a must. Les knows what the reader wants: his life an adventures with the Bay City Rollers. And this is what you're going to get, tons of memories of fans, concerts and anecdotes of one of the more popular bands of the 70's. He got a big ego, but most of his rants are well argumented and I agree with him in a lot of his observations. Highly entertaining and recommended."
3,Bitter Party of One,"The majority of this book is about Les trashing Eric Faulkner... he accuses Eric continuously of being jealous of him but I don't see Eric out there trashing Les. The forward claimes Les ""is the BCR""-- what a bunch of bull. The BCR were Eric, Woody, Derek, Alan and Les... they all had their loyal fan following and still do. This book has left a bad taste in my mouth but I still love the BCR, they were a big part of my teen years and will also be a rollermaniac."
5,Must read for Les fans...,I was broken up by the initial writings in the book regarding Les's childhood and that of his siblings. It makes me happy I live in the USA. Les was my favorite roller and learning about his ups and downs with Rollermania and Tam Paton was eye opening. I had no idea because after they split up I lost touch with him and the band. I am happy Les is putting his life back together and my heart bleeds for those young boys now men for what they went through in the name of success and the fight over their fortunes so rightfully deserved. They were and always will be my favorite band. I still listen to their cd's in the car and remember the happy times and the way they made me feel 35 years ago! This is a must read for any of Les's fans and I am looking forward to his new book release in 2011. Thank you Les for bringing the light back into my life.
2,Has aged poorly,"First the good: Soupy Sales was good in front of the camera. He was relaxed, fun loving, consistently upbeat, and seemed to be having a great time goofing around with the characters on this popular children's show. Now the bad: this show has not aged well. The low resolution black and white looks very crude today. Were these remastered? I think not. The jokes fall flat. The ultra-low budget was apparent throughout. It looks like it was thrown together with a few wooden crates and two hand puppets. It isn't entertaining. It drags on forever. I fast forwarded through most of the episodes. It is that boring.If you had fond memories of this, remember, you were probably age 5 - 12 when you first saw this. It looks bad now."
3,Dissappointing programs,"While the dvd's were well done, I am dissappointed that in both sets of this show, neither really covers his first Soupy Sales Show from the 50's.In my view, the other programs weren't nearly as good as his first show that aired in the 50's.Ture, on this one they included a bit on one of the original shows showing what he was actually watching behind the door while they were playing ""The Stripper"" music, but, outside of that, I was pretty dissappointed.William Cahill"
2,Soupy says,"Looks like this DVD was thrown together and not well edited. It's ok, but diapointing. Some passable bits, but not the great stuff. Anyway, it is cool to see Soupy in action now that he is gone."
4,Soupy Sales,"The dvd came right on time and the service was good. However, the disc is not just in black and white but very old looking - really scratchy and it was a copy of the original tape so it looks like we are seeing an 8mm projector. I think that is how it was to come but it was disappointing to watch."
3,The original Soupy Sales shows don't exist!,"Thought I'd clear up some of the confusion regarding the B/W Soupy shows. I'm a Detroit TV historian who has contributed to three books regarding Detroit television. In my archives I have puppeteer Clyde Adler's photos and memorabilia, including the original White Fang and Black Tooth puppets used on 12 O'Clock Comics, the original name of the Soupy Sales Show.I'm sorry to say that the only complete Detroit Soupy show that has survived is the Jell-O pilot from 1958, which aired on the ABC affiliate stations. That show was shot on 2"" Quad tape and the original is now in my possession. Soupy has no shows; neither does WXYZ-TV in Detroit. All tapes were used and reused until they wore out, then they were tossed- standard practice back then. If any other Detroit shows had survived, Clyde Adler, who was also a technician at the station, would have had copies.It's a shame that so little of Soupy's early work exists, but those are the facts, folks!"
5,Dental chocolate,These came out so cute for my dental school graduation party! Easy to use and good size. I layered white chocolate for the teeth and pink chocolate for the gingiva.
3,A Different Color of Carly,"This is an interesting album. It shows an artist trying new things. She fails miserably on a couple of counts and scores very high on a couple of others. The mis-steps are listenable because it's funny how far a person will go to be in with the times (""Spy"", the title track is as Disco as disco gets) and how far they will go to break out of their own molds (""Coming to Get You"" is just plain awful as Ms. Simon attempts to conceal her identity as a passionate singer by screaming and affecting a southern accent.)On the other hand, she scores with the lovely ""Just Like You Do"" and the hauntingly beautiful ""We're So Close"" is about as sad as a song can get. The catchy ""Vengeance"" works well on most levels and, lastly, ""Memorial Day"" boasts several solos, most notably David Sanborn.This was a middle of the road album for Ms. Simon, whose work has been much stronger since but this is fun to listen to, especially since it is the last of her albums to be made available on CD."
3,One of the greatest songs ever made is on Spy,"Were so Close is the greatest song ever made. I could play this song untill I die,and it will never get old.This Song is clearly the death of her marriage to JT. The Alto Sax of David Sanborn made me a fan of his also.But Pure Sin really Rocks.I heard this song on a hard rock station when the album came,I couldn't beleive it was Carly.There are a couple of lossers on this Album,but no Guts,no Glory,and Carly has always had the Guts to try new trends in Music."
4,"Carly Simon's ""Spy""","When this LP came out after ""Boys In The Trees"", I was disappointed. Now, after 20+ years, it is one of my favorites. I agree with previous reviewers, ""We're So Close"" is a classic. A few weak cuts, but overall, a great LP, well, CD! The rarely shown video for ""Vengeance"" is a visual treat."
4,"""Were so Close""the greatest song every recorded is on ""Spy""","""Were so Close,"" is the greatest song ever recorded. I love this song so much,I only alow myself to play it once a year. With Carly on Piano,and David Sanborn on Sax,its a Classic. I've never heard a song constucted like this one,its so different. This is Carly's Masterpiece. When this album came out,I was at the park,and on ""WDVE"" a hard rock station in Pittsburgh,Pa,they were playing Carly's ""Pure Sin."" I couldn't believe they were playing one of her songs on this station.It's a different side of Carly. ""Vengeance"" was the single released from the album. A great song that went no were. ""Never Been Gone,"" and ""Love you by heart,"" are beautifull also. If I was to have only one Carly Simon record,this would be the one.Even though there's alot of cuts I don't care for on this tape.Like ""Coming to get you""and ""Memorial Day"" that goes on forever. I was so happy when this Album came out on CD last year. A must buy for any Carly Simon fan."
4,The End Of An Era,"I brought this album shortly after I sawCarly perform ""Vengeance"" and ""We're So Close""on the Midnight Special when I was 12. It wasmy first contemporary rock album i bought and I wore itout, invented harmonies to sing along with herto every track I could. Definitely an excitingtime for my musical developing ear. Before thisStreisand was my only musical muse. This album opened meto an idea I still have to this day. Good musicis universally able to transcend boundaries of race,class, and age. Looking back at her catalog ""MemorialDay"" is still an epic of mystery to me-a road Carlywent down artistically that she arguably hasn't beento since."
3,mixed bag,"Let me first warn you that I am a huge Carly fan, so I am a bit biased. This is a strange album, a blend of the clasic haunting Caly love songs of regret like ""we're so close"", perhaps one of her most heartfelt songs on any album, a few rocky numbers perhaps made with an eye on the charts , like ""vengeance"", with Tim Curry of ""Rocky Horror"" fame and the truly bizarre almost experimental ""memorial day""...hey, whoever told Carly that her fans would like a drum solo??????. Like I said, a mixed bag. Carly fans will get a lot out of it, newcomers to Ms Simonshould start with the sublime achievement that is the album ""Boys in the Trees"""
2,low quality steel,"This knife is seductive. It almost sells itself, as it looks good, feels good and operates well. It even cuts well for a little while. Then, it dulls, and need resharpening. It takes a fairly good edge easily, but doesn't hold it. End of story.Like most Chinese products, it is made to sell, not to last.It would be overpriced at half."
4,The BEST of the Later Years,"For the fans that want the songs titles; Grand Hotel, Pandora's Box, Fresh Fruit, Bringing Home the Bacon, Something Majic, Fool's Gold, Nothing But The Truth, Toujours L'Amour, As Strong As Samson, T.V. Caesar, Wizard Man, The Unquiet Zone, A Souvenir Of London, and The Idol. This is a great CD. The sound is first rate. My only gripe is the next to nothing insert which list the songs and which LPs they were from. Clearly not on a par with their earlier work but still fascinating."
3,"Wilbur utters the Anti-Messiah's name; but I got stuck on this before knowing, and I like it too much...","Not my favorite; but it's Jewish style music, and worth having. I don't like any Christian (false religion) or Jesus (false Messiah) influened stuff; but good music is hard to find that isn't poisoned by that. Paul does go Geez-us, Geez-us, Geez-us, cheese wiz all over us in some of his presentation - which makes me puke! But, this is good Jewish style music, and I really got accostomed to this CD before I realized that Geez-us (Jesus) was from the Whore of Babylon - the Anti-Messiah! I just skip the disk forward when i hear that repulsive name...!I give a 3 star; but anything with cheeze wiz Geez-us (Jesus) influence or utterance - acknowledging acceptance of it therefore - should get a minus, or at least a zero REJECT!"
5,Not enough stars!!!,"I love this cd, I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed the second (Zion) from him. Mine was stolen and I'm excited to be able to reorder it!!!! Wonderful praise and worship music that speaks my soul!!!!! Praise our glorious Lords name forever!!!!"
5,Love it,THe Art work is diffrent from the one I had but the quality is excelent they told hte truth and thats what I like most
4,A good band with a great vocalist,"Bob Chester followed Miller's reed sound, but had a completely different set of charts and style of playing. He seemed better recorded, and of course, had the stunning Dodie O'Neill as his vocalist for some of his - but not all - recordings. She had a totally unique and recognisable voice, far ahead of its time in a way, and it's a mystery that more wasn't heard of her. This is a good sampling of a second division outfit, but one that managed to stake an individual segment of the market at the time.Should be on any serious big band collectors shelves."
3,Band has some of the Miller sound.,"Overall, the band arrangements are fine and in some cuts the sax section sound like the Glenn Miller sax section. The girl vocalist sounds better than average."
5,Viva El Chago Man,"This is the hottest CD in years. It combines the hip-hop influences of the north with the Chago Man's salsa background. Watch out Enrique, the Chago Man will be dominating Spanish music in the States for the next decade!"
1,Not worth the time,"I am a big Charles Earland fan, but this cd sounds absolutelyhorrible. The recording sounds as though the microphones wereunder a garbage can. I am an expert on soundboard recordingsthrough my experience with the Grateful Dead, and this is NOTa soundboard recording. Not only that, but tenor sax player EricAlexander is incorrectly identified as Eric Anderson. This is one of the WORST sounding compact discs I have ever heard. Don'twaste your time or money on this one!"
2,Oversized Nylon Mat Bag,"This bag is oversized and can probably carry two regular yoga mats or an extra thick one. However, this bag is not what I wanted. I expected it to be extra long too. I have a 72"" mat that I need a bag for and this mat does not work. I also do not like the nylon material. It is not a solid cover. The middle of the bag is an open weave so you can see through it. Certainly wish that I hadn't bought it. I have no complaints for ordering through Amazon.com."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"As someone with bad joints, I always do yoga with 2 mats, which is a pain to carry around...that is, until I found this yoga mat bag. I am easily able to carry both yoga mats, a small towel, and socks. There is even a small zippered pocket where I can put my lip balm, hair clips, and hair band. The open mesh design is lightweight and allows for everything to air out as well. Love it!"
4,perfect,"for what I wanted. I wanted extra room for my thick yoga mat, plus room for clothing. The price is great, the quality is good. It is extra strong."
2,Mixed results,"This bag is nice and big, but within a few weeks of use, the seam split on the bottom near where the strap is sewn in.I typically throw in my Manduka mat, a 1 liter Nalgene, a strap, shorts and a T-shirt. This is supposed to hold two mats. How?"
2,Thirsty Plants.,"I'm still not quite sure if this product is working or not but the soil in my potted plants has changed to a white crusty substance. Since I am no expert with plants, I can not tell you what this means but the soil does not look healthy anymore. I thought this product might work because another reviewer (on another site), wrote that it helped his gerbera plant to flower. It has not done so with mine. In fact, I think this product makes my plants very thirsty and dry because I had to water it more frequently as I used the maxicrop seaweed. I'm not sure what works with gerbera plants but in my opinion, this product is not the answer."
3,maxi corp plus iron,great delivery speed but was disappointed with bottles size would like a bigger available size bottle or powder cant rate product since i haven't seen any change in my plants yellowing in my aquaponic system
4,Handy and Portable,"I bought the factory reconditioned version of this tool and haven't had any regrets. It's a great companion for my Bosch planer when I'm doing edge work. I've used it with my Bosch Finecut saw to true up studs when installing drywall. And I used it to do surface prep work when painting wooden house siding. The variable speed adjustment helps to match the speed to the work. I am pleased, but it gets 4 stars since I had difficulty with the front roller when adjusting the tracking on a new sanding belt. Being unfamiliar with the adjustment mechanism, I got it too loose, and the front roller came off. You must look carefully at the shape of the roller pin ends to reinsert them into the right hole in the bracket. It takes a bit of studying, but once you know the particulars, using this helpful tool is a breeze. Go Bosch!!"
3,Should Be Better.,I don't know why Imation sells these matte CD labels insted of their more better glossy ones;they do work very nicely though.
4,Not EBM,"Admittedly, I don't own this entire album, but I have their 1991 release, Shelter and the title track off of this (Liquid). I wanted to point out that I don't think Seven Red Seven qualifies as EBM given that they actually sing (EBM artists tend to grunt) and the music is more synth-pop (meaning 'smoother' than EBM artists). As one reviewer mentioned, they do compare closely to Cause & Effect. I would also add a loose similarity to Depeche Mode. There were a number of Depeche Clones in this era (Camouflage, Red Flag, etc), but I think Seven Red Seven differs enough that I wouldn't call them a clone.In the end, if you like good synth-pop, you'll find a lot to like in Seven Red Seven. I'm surprised how they missed out on becoming at least a little popular. They must have been a little too late to the dance I guess."
2,More Made-for-XM-Radio World Music,"It's difficult to identify much in this album that is unique, much less compelling. The music is derivative in the worst way: rather than meld, the music only mixes Ali Farka Toure and world beat vagaries. This sounds very much as though it was created backwards, starting with marketing and sales, and ending with the quality of the music itself. If slickly-produced Starbucks soundtracks are not your cup of tea, then you will want to avoid this."
4,title,"the late Keith Whitley had one of the most evocative voices in the history of bluegrass; it slides and ripples around in the most affecting way. This album wonderfully showcases his singing style and also features some great bluegrass picking. The musical style often veers towards straight country, and the electric bass is a little bit annoying, but to hear Whitley sing ""Rose-colored Glasses"" is a wonderful thing, even if it isn't very bluegrass. And there is some straight-ahead bluerass on here; the Flatt&Scruggs segment is excellent, and ""Sugar-Coated Love"" rocks. ""Memphis Mandolin"" has some very interesting and atypical banjo work from JD."
4,Solid live bluegrass from one of the '70s best bands,"Okay, so if YOU were J.D. Crowe, and you were about to go on a triumphant tour of Japan, playing for their unique brand of wildly appreciative fans, who would you pick to go as your back-up band? Well, fiddler Bobby Sloane, Jimmy Gaudreau, Steve Bryant and future country star Keith Whitley are all good choices, and sure enough, that's who he took. The boys whiz through a solid set of crowd-pleasing favorites, sticking pretty close to their strengths. The sound quality is pretty good, with just a hint of amphitheater hall muffle, but mainly it sounds great. The album closes with the band hamming it up on a set of stereotyped commercial bluegrass, ""The Ballad Of Jed Clampett,"" etc., as they goofily recreate an old Martha White radio show. You can pretty much stop the album when that comes on, and not miss much, at least if you've already heard hose old routines. On the whole, though, not much to complain about with this disc."
3,Stonewall 3 CD set,An ok collection of disco sounds.Nice pix on cover of CD's with awarning of offensive images. Oh my!My copy was found at a used CD store.Not bad for US $....AJ
2,Very Disappointing,It is a good listing of stamps but so few pictures of the stamp. I would not recommend.
2,A 1952 Rigoletto.,"I was very disappointed in this Rigoletto. The sound is so bad that it is a distraction to the fine singing (as far as I can tell). I have CD's and Vinyl of this age (1952) and older with much better sound. I should have paid more attention to the quality of the online samples, I guess. I will occasionally play it because of the wonderful singers, but I did not get my money's worth for the premium price I paid. I would return it to Amazon if I could."
1,horrible,"I did not recieve my product at all and wenevr I ask them for an update, they do not respond.LOL The customer service does not respond to your e-mails; so its better to stay away from this store and buy the same product elsewhere; just to be on the safer side."
4,Do Re Mi misleading,"This CD is fine. It is mellow, and I have no huge problem listening to the songs, unlike some children's music that makes me want to run away covering my ears.The problem I have with this CD is the ""Do Re Mi Dragon"" theme. I was hoping this CD would have solfege incorporated. It does not, but worse, the ""Do Re Mi"" syllables used in the music are used as arbitrary syllables and are not on the scale degrees do, re, and mi. For example, one line states (Do, Re, Mi, Do) and the notes used are (F#, G#, A, A~B~A) So not only are the solfege pitches inaccurate, Mi and Do are the same note. If you care about this, don't buy it."
2,OK in a pinch,"Most of the tools in this set feel flimsy and, in the case of the pizza cutter, too small to be useful. I found myself in quick need of set of tools and, as a Prime member, I could get them in two days. But every time I pick up something from the set, I wish I had spent twice the money on something that I would have been happy with. My boyfriend picked up the spatula and asked me if I thought it would make it through the dishwasher! Lesson learned. Might be okay for a vacation home, RV, boat, or college student."
3,You get what you pay for,"On the one hand, you get a wide variety of tools for a very low price. On the other, they're far from sturdy.I just got these yesterday so I haven't had a chance to try them out, yet. I think these are fine for someone who is looking for a quick cheap fix or is a casual cook, but anyone else should shell out for something more durable."
1,Not really worth it,"I bought this set about 2 years ago and I don't have much of it left, but each piece has been a disappointment of its own. For example, the slotted turner melted the first time I tried to use it to flip my pancakes. The pancakes didn't even burn, but the plastic melted all over my brand new frying pan! The vegetable peeler was loose and dull, relatively useless. The caddy just took up too much space, so I ended up throwing it out anyway. Save yourself the time and money. You'll find MUCH better quality cooking utensils at the dollar store! It's honestly not even worth $10 nevertheless $15."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I mainly got it for the base and as 'hold me over' utensils. The knives were better than I expected, nothing else is, though."
3,Some Very Funny - others not so much,"I really liked several of the ""cuts"" on the comedy CD, but some seem to be added just to fill in the ""gaps"""
1,Don't waste your money!,Not funny at all! 41 tracks and there was only 1 I might consider listening to again!
3,Artist Search,"I like the Cars album cover from Candy-O. I can't remember the artists name. Please help... Thanks, Adam"
5,No Sophomore Jinx!,"True Car's fanatics find this second album as worthy as the original and Heartbeat City! Slick and fast paced, it established the Car's as a group who could put the world into perspective, for an 18 year old boy! ""Let's Go"" ""Candy-O"" ""Dangerous Type"""
3,Not so impressive remaster,"I purchased this with the expectation that the remastered sound would easily surpass whats already out there. Frankly, listening to this CD was a let down. The bass is much better/tighter here, but the remaining sonics are unremarkable and dull. There is little dynamic range. Great music, bland reissue."
5,Brilliant sophmore offering,"Almost as good as their debut, Candy-O rocks from beginning to end. All cuts are fabulous with my personal faves being: Let's Go, It's All I Can Do, Candy-O, Since I Held You, and Dangerous Type. The smooth production by Roy Thomas-Baker makes this is a great cd to drive around with (at loud volume)."
4,surprisingly helpful,I actually found this book surprisingly helpful. when someone in my family was having pain or weird symptoms i would always turn to this book. it is also clear and easy to read.
1,Not much help,"Books of this type in the past have offered some type of home remedy or at least what type of medicine one can expect to be presribed. This book says ""consult your doctor""."
2,Good Book Poor Service,"The book is as expected, a professional discussion of medical conditions written for average family members. The condition of the book was ruined by extremely poor shipping and handling though. I recommend the book but not the source I got it from."
4,THE USUAL CLASSIC SONGS,"There are many instumental cds devoted to the music of PORTER.This one features the usual classic songs that are universally known.While good and fun to listen to,this one doesn't have the distinguished appeal of STEPHANE GRAPPELLI's almost perfect tribute or OSCAR PETERSON's short but very adventurous one.These are jazz renditions that mostly stay with the tunes.Especially worth buying if you are a PORTER collector."
2,Sadly Lacking Soul,"The old Flirtations albums were great, but with only 3 people, the sound is very thin and they sound more square than my Aunt Harriet in Boston.The two stars I gave this are for ""Sister"" (which is awesome) and ""Fun, Fun, Fun"", (which is really cute).The rest of the songs are just embarrassing to listen to.Go get the live ""Out on the Road"" CD instead!"
5,Nice! Very Nice!,This chrome mirror looks great on my Yamaha Virago! Love it! I highly recommend it! Get a set if you can!
5,Revival In Belfast,"This is the most worshipful album, I love it so much. The Irish pipes and whistles are so beautiful. It is the best album I think I have ever bought. No reason to skip any songs either.BUY IT IF YOU CAN!"
3,Great Buy.,Revival in BelfastThis was a great CD. I intend to purchase the 2nd volume as well. The hymns are beautifully sung and played. Mark Robin is definitely an artist I would like to see put out some DVD's of his music.
4,Great!,We sing the song Revival in church and I wanted to purchase a copy to listen to that song. The CD is awesome.
5,Awesome Praise and Worship,This CD is awesome for really putting your mind on the Lord and preparing for worship. I used to own the cassette and just had to have it on CD!
4,Old School,"If you played them back then and liked them, you still will.If you came along after, you won't."
4,Think Top Gun - at night.,"Eileen Ware is assigned to work as a semi-undercover security officer within a secret unit of top guns stationed in England. Their job is to find, trap, photograph, and possibly destroy a Soviet stealth fighter, nicknamed `Red Wraith' that has supposedly been spooking NATO escort aircraft in the Norwegian Sea for several months - that is, if it exists at all."
3,I don't know whether to like or hate it.,"The Milka Yoghurt Chocolate bar was odd. I found it would only taste good if refrigerated, but at the same time, it would also taste 'okay' if it wasn't.It was a very odd experience. I probably wouldn't buy it again."
5,Beauty of eastern symbols,I have bought this book out of curiosity for eastern characters and their meaning. This book not only shows you their meaning it also lets you peek into their art of writing. Very interesting book for those interested in eastern religious symbols or calligraphy in general. It is beautifully made.
5,EXCELLENT,"Well written, covers a broad range of ideas and topics. An excellent resource for Multicultural Therapy. The language is simple yet comprehensive, easy to read but informative.Buy it!"
3,Counseling the Culturally diverse,"This is a text book and I understand it is the ""Bible"" in the field. but the authors make me angry at times as they are totally mainstream modality oriented and I find it best working with clients on a holistic basis... Old time methods have proven cold and difficult to succeed..."
2,Wow,"We have been using this book in our Cultural Diversity class. Although I find some very useful information in this text, one has to sit through the material couched in Ultra liberal bias and anti-White propaganda. I admit that much harm has come from the past American generations, but this book seems like it wants us to be ashamed of being White. All other cultures presented in this text are allowed their bigotry and racist (one culture believing it is superior to another--unlike Sue & Sue's definition that you can only be a racist if you are of the majority culture) agenda; however, the White culture cannot have theirs without being viewed in a negative light. We need solutions on how to be more accepting of all cultures within the borders of these United States, not a book that segregates and blames White culture. I was hoping to study a book that offers information on differing cultures and how to appreciate them more instead of a book that tries to make me feel bad about my heritage."
2,Could Have Been Better,I was disappointed with this text. The authors repeat the same themes numerous times with little original insight. It seems to me that they are more interested in perpetuating stereotypes then providing students with any educating information.
1,"Ironically, this was written by a racist","The author of this book approaches the subject of ""cultural diversity"" with extreme prejudice and racism towards western beliefs and, specifically, an apparent dislike and disguist of anyone with European heritage. This serves to diminish the value that the subject should serve. Obviously it is important to get some understanding on where your clients are coming from, which requires introspection of what you believe and why. But hating yourself because of your color at birth won't help me serve my clients in any way."
4,More than just a singer,"For those of you who just think of Vaughn Monroe as the muscle-voiced singer of ""Racing with the Moon"" and ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"", this CD may come as somewhat of a shock. Monroe also played trumpet and led one of the better, yet underrated, big bands of the era. And that band could really swing! This is a collection of transcription recordings (done in 1943), roughly split between vocals and instrumentals. Monroe was once quoted as saying that it was RCA which forced him into recording so many vocals, and that he preferred the instrumentals. I agree, and after listening to ""Comin' On"", ""Old Man Robbing a Baker"" and ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"", you probably will too."
5,Cowboy Clint Walker ACTOR!,"Fort Dobbs is a good western. I wish it were shot in color. Clint Walker never gave a poor acting performance. Clint Walker and Errol Flynn were both outstanding actors very natural. Which is not that easy to do. So natural was he on screen understating his muscular body, never a poser.Just a damn fine actor. If he were starting out today he'd be bigger than ever. He was a man before his time . as an actor. He was a real mans man an a gentleman. Watch him act he is just that good."
4,Fort Dobbs,"I purchased this for the reason it was remastered - little disappointed in the remastering of this DVD they could have done a better job- glad I still have it - 16.9 format I like on my big screen, but audio is so so that to could have been done a little better - but being a Clint Walker fan for over 50yrs I will not overly complain - still a good story line - A+ on the music score done by Max Steiner from (Gone With The Wind) fame - I'll be honest that I will give the movie an A grade for the acting - buy it - A family film for a change"
4,A good western,"For those of us who enjoy cow-boy movies, Fort Dobbs is also a must. Good performances and a good story."
1,Fort Dobbs,"This DVDFort Dobbs [Remaster] was created outside of this country (USA) with a region code that makes it impossible to play on newer DVD players. You people should be aware of this and take steps to correct it asap. Since I paid a fair price for this DVD, I feel that you should send me another one created with a USA region code of (1). I'm not happy with this."
5,A Gospel Goldmine!,"This is a prized collection of songs by the influential Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley's favorite gospel artist. She is raucous and wild, and her rock and roll sermons have a timeless authenticity that is sure to thrill fans of quality R&B, gospel and the blues. Hallelujah!"
4,Verr...nice,"Verr nice, verr smooth, verr joyful, verr blue.Only wish for even deeper sound quality from those old recordings."
3,Sister Rosetta Tharpe,"I'm always amazed at the depth of product Amazon has. I heard of a past singer on NPR who was, it seemed to me, pretty obscure and Amazon had a ton of her recordings! Great job!"
2,A strange album..!,This is really something different! Most people who haven't heard these songs will be shocked. This is not a good album by Roy Orbison's standards. He actually apologized for this album after it's release. I can understand why.. Roy Orbison wrote only 3 of the 11 songs. Many of the songs has a kind of disco-flavour. But this album is a must for Orbison fans and for those who want to collect albums by one of rock's greatest...Kjetil Hansen NORWAY
3,Not really that bad,"Yes, this album can't compare to his early 60's work with Monument. Almost nothing, short of Mystery Girl, would compare with his greatest hits. This album, though, has a lot of good songs on it and remains an album I carry around on my iPod, along with his greatest hits. My favorites are Easy Way Out, Lay It Down and Tears. Orbison said in an interview he felt the album was unfinished to some extent, and it was recorded very close to the time he was recovering from the bypass. So while I understand the other reviewers' ""take"" on this album, I am not ready to say it was completely without merit. On the contrary, it is probably better than the many ""cover"" albums he recorded with MGM, even though those, too, had many fine songs on them. Somehow RO doing ""Help Me, Rhonda,"" however, never quite registered high on a scale of songs I'd want the Big O to do!"
