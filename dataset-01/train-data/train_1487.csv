2,Decorative Fishing Creel,"When I purchased the River's Edge Fishing Creel, I knew by the price, that it would not be durable enough to actually use in fishing. I purchased the creel for my wife as a decorative creel that she could either plant flowers in it, or use with artificial flowers. While the main body of the creel seems durable enough, the straps that are attached are not, also the way that the lid of the creel is attached to the main basket is to flimsy. ""You get what you pay for."" I am happy with the creel for the decorative purpose for which it was purchased, and my wife is using it for that purpose."
1,fishing creel,not what I expected. it was very cheaply made and wouldn't use it ito fish with only for decoration. I think if I tried to use it to fish it would come apart.
2,"Inexpensive, but also cheap!","I have a bit of a lodge theme going in my house and I wanted something to hang near the front door for dog leashes (used daily). I thought a Creel was the perfect solution. I still think it is a great idea, but I shopped for a low price and this product was definitely inexpensive. It also very cheaply made--so I guess a real antique creel is in my future!"
3,needs help,"I bought this creel for trout fishing a few weeks ago and have used it 5 times now. The Strap is too short to be able to fish while holding it, the glue holding the velcro lid strap came unglued on the first day and the lid came apart by the 5 trip. The creel definately needs some help before being ready to use but after a few strategically placed wire ties and a longer strap it can be used to fish with. All in all i would say this creel is poor quality but it can be easily made better very cheaply."
2,"Cheap, don't bother","All the colors started to run in less than a week. Definitely wouldn't buy this, or anything from this company, again. Don't bother"
2,Disappointing Recreation,"To leave the Virgin Mary entirely within the confines of the biblical frames of reference is to miss the better part of what she is, and what she has been about for 2,000 years. I found this presentation plodding. The flights of fancy were of the Kitty Hawk variety, historical and rhetorical rather than imaginative. I hope my heirs never pass this one along to a library. It was a disappointment."
5,I loved the bulk packaging,"These arrived on time and in great shape. I bought 4 packages of these so that I could give individual bottles as wedding favors for my wedding. It was great to be able to find these in large quantities and reasonable cost. I wished there were more, because they didn't have enough for me. If you're planning to do something similar and can't find this on Amazon, you can also go to Wal-Mart / Target to find them at a decent rate. But, they only have about 20 bottles on the shelves at a time. So, you'll have to go back multiple times. I speak from experience. :)"
2,"Okay, But Maybe Not So Fab...","This book is okay. There are some fun pieces, but a lot of the jewelry looked more like ""found objects"" than like ""fabulous jewelry.""Note: I think ""okay"" should be three stars, not two, but I couldn't figure out how to change that!"
5,The first book my son ever finished.,Bravo Jim Davis! My son who was never an avid reader could not put this one down. We cant wait for 2 @ 3.
5,Funny with a lot of sci-fi action.,I think this book is good for just about all readers. It's hilarious
5,It is fabulous!,Hi!My is Melody Li. I have always been a fan of Garfield. The Outrageous Origin is a splendid book! Garzooka( whatever) starts insulting the king. Garfield comic books are really worth collecting.
5,The Infamous Mellow Yellow - Crocus Saffron Plant,"The Essential Saffron Companion by John Humphries is the most accurate and comprehensive book ever written about the ""Mellow Yellow"" plant (Crocus Sativus). It is packed with historical points about the bulb to the characteristics of the plant once bloomed. All good details and very accurate. Also, the recipes are top-notch castillian cooking. Very much authentic of the European Spanish-style cooking. Bravo, JH!"
3,essential ? confusing !,"I bought this book for its specific instructions on how to use saffron - infusions - which I think are interesting. But many of the recipes for entrees and side dishes seem difficult and confusing as written, or outright wrong. For example, in Devonshire Saffron Cake, the author states that either heavy cream or butter can be substituted for the original clotted cream."
5,Great addition to my home studio,"I used to take Pilates classes with an instructor at a studio, but when that got too expensive I began building my own home studio and wanted a 'magic circle' to add to it. I came across this and many other products on Amazon to help me do it. This piece in particular, was a good product."
5,Challenging Addition to Pilates Workout,"I'm 5'3"" and I purchased this 12"" magic circle to use with the Classical Pilates Technique: Magic Circle Mat Series & Reformer Mat Workout. It really enhances the Pilates experience, I was sweating halfway through the workout. The only drawback, and this might just be because I bruise easily, I developed bruises on my calves and ankles from holding the circle. I ended up putting folded towels between the circle and my skin which made it very comfortable to use."
4,Challenging Intermediate level,"The pieces are a little fragile if one is not careful when punching them out - and they are not pre-drilled, so cracking is a risk. But when assembled carefully and correctly, a great little robot."
3,Christmas activity with my nephew,This was a great way to spend quality time with my 9-y-old nephew. He's a bright kid with good attention span but there's no way he could've assembled it by himself. There were lots of extras of the tiny easily lost parts. I was disappointed in the end though that the robot would only work on a limited range of surfaces and that it kept falling over.
4,Dwight Doing his stuff !!,"Dwight doing his thing !great guitar work , voice + twang ! so different from any country artist - just gets you going , songs with tempo !"
2,Curate's egg,"Tables are useful, but some aerodynamic content is doubtful. In particular the 'explanation' of how a wing generates lift is plain wrong."
1,Not pleased,"I have purchased this before and have not been dissapointed. This time I havea case of dry washcloths. I know I can wet them, but being handicapped itjust takes me longer to do things. Also, I cannot put them through-out thehouse. I have to keep them near the sinks."
4,Kirstie is worth the price!,Good movie. Arrived quickly. The plot is interesting and the acting not bad but this is probably the best performance I've seen from Kirstie Alley and her character alone is worth the purchase price.
1,never recieved,gave up on waitingattempted to contact at time of salehowever its been a couple of yrs since i purchase it
4,Special Style Will Blow You Away,"Kelly was one of my teachers and friend many years ago when he was first getting started. I admired him then and when I first heard his music on CD's, I was totally blown away! Wow! If you are a blues fan, you will love his music. Congrats, Kelly!"
5,His First and BEST,"This is a musician's muscician at his best. The new listener is truly lucky, and will be treated to the most stunningly proficient slide guitar (stop what you're thinking -- this is not sloppy, roadhouse twang, but brilliantly interwoven guitar like you've never heard before) and utterly unique vocals. Even legendary guitarists like Leo Kottke have offered special praise for Phelps. Yet this is warmly accessible and engrossing music -- you'll be singing it in the shower -- and his original songs sound as if they've been handed down for a hundred years. Top 10 favorite of the 500 cds I own."
3,"Great for execs, tough but not impossible for avg person","If you are an executive with a big expense account and eat in fine restaurants most of the time, this book is probably a godsend. For the rest of us, who pack our lunches or eat in cafeterias, cook most of our meals at home and occasionally dine at Olive Garden or Chili's, the diet is extremely restrictive. The food variety depends on the ingredients and cooking techniques available to gourmet chefs. You must be willing to bake your own bread, cook at home, shop for some hard to find ingredients, or do without. However, it seems to work. I've lost 4 lbs in the first week, and have heard great testimonials from friends. I plan to continue and see if I can reach my goal! The book is VERY entertaining, however. The author has a dry sense of humor that makes it quite enjoyable, and his principles for controlling blood sugar really seem to work."
4,"If you are concerned with your health, buy this book","I dont' believe in ""diets"". After being in Paris and losing weight, a friend recommended this book. I'm following Phase 1, and took off 6 kilos in a month; I will lose 12 more in 2 more months!!! This book is based on changing eating practices(to healthier), not just temporarily changing your eating habits. It's based on scientifically proved biological studies, which give you distinctions on how to be trim. If you dine out, like me every single day, buy this book and start losing weight."
5,A new way of looking at food,"I lost 35 pounds in just a few months. And the best part is that after reading the book, the weight is staying off. It has given me a new way of looking at food and I really don't miss the old habits. I recommend the book to everyone I know that is sick of diets and fads and can't keep their weight in check."
5,Great Book,"In Europe, Montignac's work has a huge influence and it's understandable. His plan works and the book explains why. If you love eating great food and want to attain and maintain your healthy weight, buy this book and use it. Also, for additional reading (not to mention recipes), Suzanne Sommers' book Eat Great Lose Weight is, as far as I can tell, the Montignanc ""Method"" and her recipes are incredibly good."
4,"English version of ""Plus je mange, plus je maigris""","Michel Montignac's book, while written in a less ""scientific"" way than Sears' ""The Zone"" or Eades' ""Protein Power"", provides very similar nutritional guidelines.The book stresses more forcefully than the other two that the key to proper nutrition and sustained bodyfat loss is to properly combine foods (i.e., not mix protein-dense foods and starches in a same meal), so as to keep blood insulin levels under control."
2,Increasingly out of date,"Michel Montignac's book gives an overview of the Glycemic Index concept and how it can be applied to weight loss. There is no question that the GI is a powerful tool in healthy eating and in achieving weight loss. However, this book is simply out of date. For example, it states that normal refined pasta should not be eaten because it is high GI . . . wrong. It states that carrots are high GI . . . wrong. Both of these myths have been disproved by more comprehensive, modern research. If you want to fully understand this approach I highly recommend a brand new book, The New Glucose Revolution. It is absolutely up-to-date, and written by a world expert in the field Professor Jennie Brand-Miller."
2,"Dine Out and Lose Weight;, Michel Montignac","A friend recommended this book to me. I found it to be just another ""version"" of the Adkins Diet. Very restrictive and unrealistic to a normal healthy lifestyle. If you're into the science of diet tnen this book will give you everything you ever wanted to know concerning this type of eating. Maybe others find eating only certain foods in combination with others a great way to live. Sorry, that's not for me!"
3,Nice Single CD,"First Xp Single by recording artist Johnnie Newkirk Jr. and New West Music & Publishing, Inc. Good start."
5,Liza's Back,"I have been a great fan for years and in fact I once had the privilege of meeting Liza after a concert in Cincinnati in the 1970's. This CD brings back all of the excitement and thrill of the Liza we all love. I laughed, cried and yelled out-loud while listening to this CD. I would give it a 10. If you love Liza, you will love ""Liza's Back""."
2,Enough already!,"How many live recordings can one artist release? In Liza's case, this makes 10! Liza has not explored enough new musical ground to warrant so many live releases. Enough already! If you're a fan, you'll love this. If not, it won't change your mind. Liza's voice has so much character now, she should be discovering new ways to express herself musically, instead of trotting out the same warhorses."
1,How sad is this!,"I know I'll upset people with this review, but here goes ... I have loved Liza Minnelli from the time I first saw her perform. She was an incredible talent, absolutely incredible. The key word here, though, is WAS. This CD is just plain awful. It broke my heart to listen to it. Her voice is gone. It is actually painful to listen to this. If you want to hear Liza sing some of her Cabaret songs or others from the past, buy the old CD's, not this one. Remember her as she once was. I'm going to destroy this CD so that someone else does not get hold of this and listen to it. Heartbreaking."
1,Cannot Sing Anymore,"I am a big Liza fan, but this album is way beyond retirement. Her voice has no spark at all and she sound like she has had quite a few drinks lately. So sad."
4,Great return!,"This cd is filled with her classic CABARET tracks as well as many other highlights...among them is the Melissa Manchester DON'T CRY OUT LOUD, the deliciously funny SOME PEOPLE, and her standard NEW YORK, NEW YORK and a great version of I'LL BE SEEING YOU to close out the album! It is a good cd filled with Liza's witty humour....she is a legend! Welcome back!"
1,Definitely not worthy of the Garland family name!,"ANOTHER ATROCITY, to quote one of our tired resident Amazon reviewers. This poor child of Garland has gotten by on nothing more than the fact that she is biologically related to the finest singer of the last century. All the false eyelashes and overdone choreography will never cover up the fact that this woman cannot sing. Talk about a wobble! You could jump rope through it!"
5,GO LIZA!,Liza is truly back! Buy this c.d! The songs are all wonderfully arranged and Liza sounds as good as ever. She can sing people!I would give her more stars if I could!
5,Where did the tracks go?,"I have to give the album a 5 because, after all, it is Liza we're talking about. I am however disappointed that songs from the concert were left out of the cd. This should have been another two-cd set. Where did Mary J. Blige's Family Affair go, or the beautiful rendition of I Believe You? I'm mad at whoever made the decision to cut those songs.....Anyway, this a must for any Liza fan, new or old. The concert that began her comeback.....Happy Listening."
1,BUYER BEWARE!,"This collection features LIZA on stage in the latest decade.Awful Awful Awful for anyone that loves Liza's original work.If you love ""Liza"", a hardcore follower and are a completist you'd probably want this.Anyone like myself who wasn't born and hasn't followed Liza her entire career and you're just getting around to hearing a lot of her work and you want something by her to get into. PASS THIS UP!!, You will be dissappointed.I put this CD in as soon as I came out of towerrecords after spending $22. I was with my mother whoby the way) ""Was"" around throughout liza's career and we both cringed at the sound of her voice. She sounds like a very very very OLD WOMAN. It's not becoming...I was so annoyed and aggravated.I was expecting Liza's upbeat, strong and perky youthful voice when she was in her prime to sit back enjoy. NOT this madness. I know someone out there can appreciate this, but definitely NOT I."
4,Liza with a Zest,"This 2002 concert produced by Liza's ex, David Gest, has Liza in good form. all the hits are here and then some. A must for any Liza fan."
4,Sky Rider,"My grandson loved this story,it was well written,the illustration and water colors were beautiful."
4,Tomb Raider:Legend for Xbox 360,"I like it, the game came to me very quickly after ordering. There are very minor scratches but the game works great. I would recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of Tomb Raider and/or loves games that make you use your head."
2,If only. . .,"I really want to like this game! My daughter wants games with lead female characters. I bought this for her. Laura can do cool stuff . . . if only the game developers had done it right. The camera views are not easy to use. Load times are long. And stuff that should be easy, like going from one vine to another, just are not. Or walking along a tree you've felled to get to the next ledge. Bummer."
5,Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!,"This is one incredible game! The graphics are fantastic and the controls are fairly simple. There is a good bit of fighting sprinkled with puzzles that are very challenging. Don't worry though - you won't get ""stuck"" anywhere for too long. The motorcycle racing/fighting is a real plus in this game. Don't miss out on this one."
4,Mag Mini Blinds,Arrived on time in good condition. Easy to install. Great for winter proofing lake cottage for added privacy. Love it if I could find wooden magnetic blinds!
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I needed blinds for the back door of the house I rent. The door takes a significant amount of direct sunlight every afternoon and really heats up the house. I saw these and because they were magnetic, i.e. not permanent, and not expensive, I decided to give them a try. The magnets work very well. They stay on the door, in place, even when pulling the drawstring to open/close the blinds. There are magnets on the bottom of the blind too to keep them from flying around when opening and closing the door which work well also. They do the job of keeping the sunlight (and heat) out and look pretty good as well."
4,Easy but overpriced,"This is just a $10 blind that sells for more because it comes with specialized magnets for mounting. As such, it was very easy to set-up and looks good, but I think it's overpriced ($45 after shipping for mine). However, if the blind breaks, I think I will be able to use the magnets with a cheaper blind. I recommend it, but it has a below-average price/value ratio."
5,Magnetic blinds,These blinds are very easy to install and they are very sturdy. They do a great job of filtering out the light.
4,Strong magnets,"These blinds have very strong magnets to hold them securely to the door. My only complaint is the top of the blind does not have a finishing strip like my other mini blinds do, so they look a bit unfinished. Overall, I am very satisified. Let the sun shine!"
2,Not impressed,"I ordered these, thinking they would be a simpler window treatment for our french doors. They are a very harsh white compared to the white of my doors (which I always thought was white). The blinds are flimsy and surely wouldn't last long in a house with kids or on a very frequently used door. I must say though, the magnets are very strong and they are easy to put up."
1,Won't work as ad and reviews indicated,I returned it. Paint was missing and it wouldn't stay up the first time I closed the door. I would suggest it be pulled from the market.
1,Terrible product,"Wow! What a disappointment. The blinds came ""pre-bent"" about 1/3 of the way from the bottom and they would not close. I am sure they had been used and repackaged without inspection. The vanes were so thin they were like notebook paper. The magnets kept slipping off the steel doors and I did not even open the second one, just sent them both back. I ended up buying magnetic rods from another company and using sheers over the doors. I do not recommend at all!"
1,Complete P.O.S,"I purchased these blinds about two weeks ago. When I first got them I was very happy and would of given them a 4/5 star rating. Here I am two weeks into these blinds and now they are broken, one of the connecting strings at the top came loose with the metal cap at the end and now it is impossible to open and close the blinds with the rotating plastic knob. So functionality wise I would give these blinds a 4/5, durability wise they are a 1/5. $45 down the drain for two weeks of blinds.These get a 4/5 for functionality and not a 5/5 because the mounting system is garbage. It is easy to install but it is not sturdy enough, when pulling on the string to raise the blinds the entire thing will come crashing down, these were not designed with quality in mind but rather inexpensive convenience."
2,wonderful,I AM SO PLEASED WITH THIS MAGNETIC BLIND. IT IS STRONG AND DOESN'T MOVE WHEN THE KIDS SLAM THE DOOR. I HAD A ROLLUP BLIND ON MY DOOR FOR YEARS. I WILL NOT DO THAT AGAIN. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BLIND. THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT AND WHAT I HAVE ALWAYS GOTTEN WITH ITEMS ORDERED FROM AMAZON.COM
1,No storyline,This movie contained very little in the way of a storyline. Acting is normal for a typical David DeCoteau film.
2,Confusing For a Math Major,"I am a math major in collgege and this was the most confusing thing I have ever tried to put together. Now I am still young and so am not that illiterate, but the directions and just every part was so confusing. If it wasn't I would not put a review up. I would say not to get it. Get them a puppy, so much less work."
5,Under armour heat gear,"This is one of the best workout investments one can make. It makes your skin feel cool even under a T-shirt. In a breeze or at a run the effect is amplified. I was hesitant to try it at the price, but I don't play or practice without it now."
4,Best of both world product!!,"If you really follow the direction how to wash it then should not be a question. I promptly remove it from the dryer or hang dry. It dries out very fast and does the job it promises. ""those who can't dance should not dance at all"""
3,Eh,Looks better than the Scosche kit but the position of the head unit when attached to the frame is not adjustable at all. This is a problem with especially bulky head units with lots of wires in the back for accessories. The plastic brackets used to mount the head unit are poor quality and strip out easily. Went with the Scosche and I'm satisfied.
1,Never buy kits from METRA!,"I recently purchased a radio kit for my honda civic 2007, whenInstalled found the color did not match the rest of theDash and A/C component did not fit perfect as it should,Two days later the kit started to bend with the heat.I personally do not recomend this product at all."
2,Don't quality =(,No fits in perfectly with the dashboard's 08 Honda Civic sedan. falls coating paint over time
3,Over-hyped,"This must be for people who love Will Farrell, and I do not. I tried. I believe he is talented, but he is not for my taste. I think there are many other terrific Christmas movies that are much more enjoyable - Prep and Landing (more than one), The Guardians, Polar Express, The Santa Claus (the first), to name a few."
5,Great Christmas Movie,"While some of the humor is a little over the top (and what's wrong with that?) This movie is great! Will Ferrell stars as a human raised by elves who comes to meet his true father in New York. Along the way hijinks ensue. Zooey Deschanel is an incredible beauty and shows off her amazing singing skills as well.If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend getting it and watching it."
4,A Great Holiday Film! ****1/2,"Elf is a wonderful holiday film starring Will Ferrell, who hits a home run as Buddy, a man raised by elves on the North Pole who decides to go to New York City to find his father. Watching Buddy discover NYC is the best part of the film and Ferrell does a great job of showing Buddy's innocence and joy at seeing this city. These scenes should make even the grumpiest person laugh aloud. While the film is very formulatic, it still delivers because of the freshness that Ferrell brings and it will be a holiday classic for years to come."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen!,This movie is a major suck fest! I watched over half of movie and finally had to throw in the towel.
1,Terrible,"Not funny for adults, very dumb. Watch home alone again and you are better off. Will Ferrell is not funny at all."
1,unable to view,I tried to download the movie but it would not download. I could not play it directly either. Did not like.
2,Okay holiday entertainment at best,"'elf' is a decent Christmas comedy about a man who was raised by a elves at the North Pole. Much of the movie is spent with Buddy, the human elf, attempting to connect with his real father, a seemingly hopeless crank on Santa's naughty list who had no idea he even had a son. The story and special effects are, all in all, so-so. My seven-year-old son indicated that the movie was boring while my nine-year-old daughter indicated that it was ""all right."" ""Home Alone"" (Home Alone) is much funnier."
3,ELF,Good and funny PG humor by non other than Will Ferrall.Solid movie with some great banter. Recommended family movie.Picture quality is 8 out of 10. Sound quality is a solid 7 1/2
5,Great Movie,I bought another product from this site and was given a $3 instant video credit and since it was right around Christmas time I figured a Christmas movie was a good choice.
2,it reloaded too many times,"I was disappointed with this purchase. If I pay to stream a specific movie, I expect it to play all the way through without ""skipping"". If I want low quality, I'll get a VHS."
2,Dissapointed..,"I was really expecting, 'Elf' to b special but it falls flat. Still I got a few laughs. Will make a decent 1 dollar Blockbuster holiday rental.I can't totally knock it."
3,Equal. Very equal.,"There are somes scenes i dislike and like. The scenes i like to laugh or fun about are scenes when baby Buddy crawls up to Santa's toy bag, when Buddy is able to help Santa to fix Santa's sleigh, and when he was talking to a little girl saying ""I'm a human...raised by elves!"" But those i didn't like were asking myself questions ""WHY WOULD THEY MIX DIRT WITH CHRISTMAS?"" If you don't get what i'm trying to say READ THIS: The dirt things are when he gets drunk with just syrup (even if it is sweet), and party likes a MANIAC! And also when he gets his father---a BRA! So, i don't think i like this 100% or hate this 100%. Parents should know this film from movie info websites before they are sure if this film is ""okey-dokey"" for their children."
1,three words- stupid stupid stupid,"I've seen some bad ones in my time, but this is stupid! All the movie is is a sheltered, immature elf-raised guy getting himself into trouble, and sometimes not getting out of it! Add in the gross parts (M&M's and syrup on pasta) and you have the total waste of time and money that this is!"
1,DON'T CONFUSE DUMB WITH FUNNY,"I rented this DVD after hearing so many great things about it. What did I learn? That there are a lot of people out there, that can't tell the difference between DUMB and FUNNY. THIS MOVIE WAS PURE DUMB!!! I did not laugh once, in fact, I had to STOP THE MADNESS and just turn the movie off near the end. TAKE MY ADVICE, if you are looking for a funny Christmas movie, get as far away from this as you can and go rent A CHRISTMAS STORY, Now that was a funny movie."
1,This movie sucks!!,A 35 year old man acting like a child....not funny..I could not go through first 30 mins..
1,"""More Cow Bell""","I have seen Will Ferrell in only one funny skit and that's the legendary ""More Cow Bell"" skit on Saturday Night Live. Otherwise, I've never found Will Ferrell funny, just obnoxious! I'm sorry I purchased this film. Perhaps, I was hoping for ""More Cow Bell."" This is definitely not funny to me; however, I can see it being funny to little children. Oh, well."
1,Horrible!,My friends told me to go see Elf because they thought it was funny. So I rented Elf and I thought it was the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Will Farrell is not even funny I mean his character acts like an idiot. The best Will Farrell movie I would recommned is Old School and Anchorman. Those were his best. I thought Elf was retarded but that's just in my opinion.
2,Meh,What do ya expect. This is a decent family movie for mindless holiday entertainment. But don't expect anything more or you'll be disappointed.
4,Funny for the Whole family,"Rented this movie for Christmas, appropriately funny for kids and adults. Would definitely watch this movie over and over again."
2,Will can't cvarry this,"Will Farrel is at his best in a part like Ron Burgundy. I love the video with Will and Pearl the landlord. As good as Will is he can't carry this flat comedy. There are some good physical gags and who wouldn't like to fantasize about spending time in Gimble's ""North Pole"" at Christmas? Maybe young children will enjoy this but it doesn't make my Christmas classic's list along with ""Christmas Story"" and ""A Griswold Christmas""; two must see movies during the Christmas season. More Ron Burgundy will, PLEASE! Ho-Ho-Ho!"
3,"Will Farrell and Zooey Deschanel, need I say more.","The sweetest side of Will Farrell co-starring ""I can't go wrong"" Zooey Deschanel. I really fun take on Christmas and ""Elfship""."
3,Pretty good.,"I heard lots of people talking about this movie and finally rented and watched it. It wasn't as funny as anticipated, but it was good enough to rent and watch!"
3,Great Kids Movie,"Buddy is a very likable character. He is the type that every mother would love to cuddle and protect, even though he is a big elf. I enjoyed this movie in the theater with the kids and I emjoyed it again on DVD."
4,Excellent... and Funny!!!,This movie was hilarious!!! I couldn't stop laughing. My wife and I really enjoyed it. James Caan is great in his typical deadpan role. Will Ferrell is absolutely OUT OF CONTROL hilarious... even funnier than Jim Carrey would have been if it were him as the Elf!
5,I watch this every Christmas! It is the best.,Will Ferrell and co-stars make this a Christmas classic for me. You gotta see it and it will keep you in stitches.Make sure you pay attention to the 4 basic food groups for elves. :)
1,Dialogue so bad you can see the pain in the actors...,"It looked like the actors in the movie were putting all of their trust in the director becuase they had no trust in the dialogue, which was terrible. The story line is jolting, the characters poorly developed, and the humor weak. Will ferrell does a decent job and so do the other actors but they have so little to work with it's a lost cause.I thought their was a really funny scene in the movie with a great performance from the actor who played the outside author the firm hires to write for them. Good job! Wait for it to come out on video."
1,Not even a 1 star film,"My wife and I rented this film last week. It made me feel more disgusted than the time I rented a film and didn't have time to watch it. This move is really terrible. I love Will Ferrel's comeday, but this moview does not use any of it. Terrible, terrible, terrible movie."
1,Waste Of Time,"Everyone went on about how cute and funny this was... yeah, maybe if you find stupidity amusing. A man is left with elves and ends up going to look for his father. He believes he's an elf so of course he tells his father this, which thinks he's crazy. The entire movie was a waste of time, and it had about 1 funny part."
1,Simply horrible,"I'm not sure why so many others liked this film, but it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story is too sappy and not funny at all. I was very disappointed with this after enjoying Will Ferrell's performance in ""Old School"". Sadly, the success of this movie will spawn a sequel for sure, but I will not get suckered again. If you're looking for holiday laughs and entertainment, then look elsewhere. This movie is a turd."
1,Look at me daddy! I'm a six foot elf!,"This movie was supposed to be a good holiday movie and I watched it actually right around Christmas and expected to enjoy it. Boy, I really didn't. Personally, it was one of my least favorite movies I've ever seen. The plot is simple and cute, being about a human that's adopted as a baby by Santa Claus to work with other elves. But when this human realizes that he's different, Santa sends him to the real world to find his real dad. Sure, it sounds cute and everything but I found it to be just terrible. It delivered no laughs and was just way too babyish and weird. I like Will Ferell on Saturday Night Live and in Anchorman but not in childish stuff like this. I also find this movie to be too simple and stupid and immature for toddlers to watch. Whenever I hear the name elf again, I'll be sure to take cover and hide. This was a dissapointment and a letdown to me."
1,elf,I didnt like the copy I recieved of elf it looked like somebody made a copy of the movie and it was a bad copy
5,Christmas Classic!,This is a must watch for the family...non-stop hilarity with a really sweet story line....Everyone will love Buddy the Elf!
4,good dvds,"I received the dvds in a timely manner. Some of the holders innside the plastic dvd holders were broken, which means the dvds were being thrown around during shipping.One dvd had a bad scratch on it."
5,Very Funny Film,"A really funny movie with an interesting premise. A human raised as an elf at the North Pole is introduced to life in New York City as he learns that he's not really an elf and that his real father is on Santa's ""naughty"" list. Much of the comedy comes from how this grown man acts like a kid because he doesn't know any better."
5,A Classic Movie,"If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing a real holiday treat it's a classic!!! My family watches Elf multiple times every year and we decided it was time to get the BLU Ray version. Will Ferrell is PERFECT as a naive, trusting and inexpiernced person. You can't go wrong watching this movie! Good for everyone!!!"
4,Cute movie,"This was a cute movie. It wasn't the funniest movie I've ever seen but it was still pretty fun to watch. I laughed out loud a few times which to me is the way I judge all comedies. If it doesn't make me laugh out loud at least once then it's just not up to snuff for me! I think Will Ferrell is usually a good bet for some fun entertainment (although Kicking and Screaming was a real stinker in my opinion). This was a good one though even for the kids which is a nice surprise. We picked both this one and Christmas with the Kranks to watch this year and I have to say this one was much funnier than the Kranks if you ask me. Never the less, if you're going for a Christmas movie I'd have to say A Christmas Story still can't be beat for laugh out loud funny."
5,Wonderful film,"This move has it all. It is sweet, kind, funny and interesting. I especially like the way they handled Buddy's inability to do anything right at the North Pole. No matter what buddy did he was encouraged, loved and treated with kindness and respect.This movie provides a wonderful lesson for children and adults alike. No matter how often you fail, keep trying. No matter how often those around you fail, keep encouraging them to keep trying.So, give up on Scrooge and spend some time with Buddy."
5,Elf,"Everyone should be well versed in the holiday time four food groups: candy, candy canes, candy corn and syrup. This will soon be one of the all-time Christmas classics if not already."
4,Elf,Just wasn't my favorite movie. My 34 year old son and his wife would give it a 5 star. They loved it.
1,Bad,"ok this movie is pretty bad. i suggest if you must see it wait till it comes out on video and dvd, then rent it. i didn't like it because they spent hardly any time at the north pole, so you don't know much about the north pole. it just falls flat. i do love will ferrell, but not in this movie."
1,Bad,"ok this movie is pretty bad. i suggest if you must see it wait till it comes out on video and dvd, then rent it. i didn't like it because they spent hardly any time at the north pole, so you don'y know much about the north pole. it just falls flat. i do love will ferrel, but not in this movie."
4,Pure feel good fantasy and fun,"A film you can watch with your family. I wouldn't call it a Christmas film as it has nothing to do with Christ, rather it is a fairytale that you want to believe, which you can watch anytime of the year. Parents can use it to talk to their kids about being ""clued in"" and ""out of the loop."" How not knowing how culture works can present problems. How sometimes an outside perspective can clarify the way we live. It would be a perfect homeschool lesson. To talk about the culture of the North Pole vs. the culture of modern day New York City. What about them works? What doesn't work? How would you like to see the world interact?"
5,You sit on a throne of lies...,"Love this movie. Not shakespeare, but there are a lot of laughs and the kids think Will Ferrell is hysterical. Very silly and not too long."
5,Best ever,I love this movie. This is my favorite movie. It keeps you going through the whole movie. One halarious scene to the next. This has to be Will's best selling movie ever. Sure to be a classic!!!
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Well, after seeing the previews of the movie I thought I was in for a mildly funny and somewhat stupid movie. Instead it turned out to be quite funny and very sweet. Definetly a movie to add to my Christmas collection. The kids will also enjoy it."
4,A New Family Christmas Classic,"""Elf"" will likely become a perennial Christmas favorite - expect to see it on TV annually beginning next year. But it deserves that future-classic status, because it is a sweet and often very funny Christmas film. Will Ferrell is perfectly fey and naive as Buddy, the full-sized human raised as an elf at Santa's North Pole. Never quite fitting in the elf-world, he discovers he has a birth father in the ""real"" world, and embarks on a journey to find and bond with him. His guileless misadventures in real-world New York are amusing and sometimes touching. The supporting cast is first-rate: James Caan, Mary Steenburgen, Zooey Duschamel... and I especially got a kick out of Bob Newhart as Buddy's adoptive father, Ed Asner as Santa, and Leon Redbone as a Burl-Ivesish snowman. Jon Favreau directs it with style and humor, with the obligatory Christmas sentimentality that never veers into mawkishness. This is a great film for all ages."
4,Good Christmas movie,"Although not a blockbuster, the movie was entertaining and fun to watch. Good clean movie for kids to watch and enjoy."
4,A new family tradition,"put on your elf hats and elf pajamas and get out the chips and soda pop.This is funnier than I thought it could be. The premise is kind of ""out there""It softens your heart and makes you laugh at the same time and before you know it, you believe.I recommend it to everyone that likes to laugh."
4,Good story,It is a good story but I found that it was not as good the second time around. Its still in our holiday lineup but its lost a bit of its honeymoon blush.
4,One of the Best to Rent for Christmas,"This is the most popular Christmas rental. We tried to get the DVD at the local video store but all they had was crappy VHS tape that was bad. We streamed this on our BlueRay for I think $2.99? Fun for my pre-teen daughters to watch, but still has too many gross jokes for younger children."
5,"Elf, gotta love it","I am not a Will Farrell fan, however, this role was made for him. One of our top 2 Christmas favs."
4,Fun and silly but enjoyable!,Elf is a rediculously funny movie for the holiday season. It's appropriate for the entire family but especially so for persons that can understand innuendo.
3,Fairly cute,"I watched this because it is my Granddaughter's favorite christmas movie. I don't know why, but it is. I would much rather see Miracle on 34th st or Bing Crosby's White christmas, but it was fairly cute."
4,Now a Christmas classic,"What else is there to say? If you like Will Ferrell, you'll love it. There are several truly LOL moments, and it's pretty kid friendly."
2,Don't put this DVD under the Christmas tree,"I got it because I really like most of the other stuff Will Ferrell does.But a jet engine on Santa's sleigh powered by Christmas spirit - come on, please - spare me.If you are like me and are a fan of Will Ferrell, I will say that there are a few funny parts mixed in. (but just a few)Maybe get it used or rent it"
2,Full of Christmas Spirit!,"You know that feeling you get when you're 10 years old, it's Christmas eve and you're tucked up in your bed all nice and snug...that's the feeling you get when you watch this movie."
2,Not very impressed :(,"The IDEA of this movie is really cute, but the end result was not. I went to the movies to see this, expecting this movie to be filled with side-splitting hilarity, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The MPAA unfortunately showed the funniest moments on the previews. Will Ferrell wasn't even very cute playing a elf who is new to the real world. He just looked like a mentally disturbed man walking on the streets in an elf costume. Ed Asner was also not the most impressive Santa I had ever seen. This is of course a must for Will Ferrell fans, but does not belong on the shelf with other Christmas classics."
2,Buddy Just Doesn't Cut It,"First off, I have to say that without Will Ferrell, the movie would be in the negatives in my book. What happened? Elf is just a bunch of corny quotes (""Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?""..) with a poorly excecuted crappy Disney classic-style ending, with a cheap moral and a lot of affection between characters. It's a childrens movie that wants to be a comedy, and it just isn't happening. Will Ferrell was the only one attempting to make it what it's not, and it's probably just up to you whether or not that's a good or a bad thing. If asked whether to watch Rice Krispies pop or Elf, I would choose the Rice Krispies. xD"
2,Amusing at times.,"While Elf has some cute and amusing moments, it plays like most other vehicles of Saturday Night Live players - a skit that goes on too long. Will Ferrell is best when he's alone off doing his weird, absurd schtick; however, the film turns to sweet, sweet syrup (the kind Buddy The Elf likes to put on his spaghetti) whenever he mingles with the other flatly drawn characters. 'Tis the season, yes, but when you don't feel anything for anyone in the film, it's hard to have even an iota of the Christmas Spirit needed to get Santa's sleigh off the ground. This one's for kids and Will Ferrell groupies only."
1,Infinifilm version CRAP,I cannot stand the Infinifilm version of this film. I can't locate the special features such as the commentary or the deleted scenes. It's a HUGE MAZE to get anywhere and I still haven't figured out this Infinifilm stuff. Why can't they have a regular DVD version of Elf where you can watch the commentary with just 1 or 2 clicks??? I've had this version since Christmas 2010 and still can't navigate through this maze.
2,Packaging Broken,"Case arrived broken, won't hold DVD disc in place, very poor quality and not up to Boss Elf's and Tall Elf's standards, must have been made by Hermie"
2,I hoped for better,"alright I love Will but this movie got old fast... gross out humor is fine and overall doesn't bother me, some of the jokes wore thin 5 min into the film, I bought it thinking it would just be great and instead I fell asleep in the middle....... not what I was looking for... rent before you buy"
2,ok,"This movie had humor, I will admit that but its not great to even watch all the way through. This movie is for little kids. Teens and adults beware, its too cheesy to see."
3,Elf,I liked the movie very much. It was funny and cool! I liked the part where the elf drinks the whole soda and then burps! That was my favorite part in the movie.
3,Meh,"I guess I wasn't in the right mood, but I expected this film to be funny, not stupid. My bad for not knowing what a Will Farrel movie meant."
2,Not good nor bad.Mediocre comedy could have been better,"Will Ferrel is wasted as the elf Buddy and he is not funny at all and James Caan as a businessman Buddy believes that is his real father is just as wasted,he looks so bored that he wishes he could have starred in a sequel to Misery.The storyline is simple and predictable with few laughs this mediocre comedy has potential but dosen't use it and the two leads(Ferrel,Caan) are mis-casted badly it looks like an embarrassment on both resumes.The only reason this gets two stars is because a midget beats Ferrel up.PS: Jon Favreau should not direct movies no more and stick to his TV show Dinner for Five."
2,"Like Movie, Didn't like errors when watching","The movie was great, the Amazon player keep freezing or error popped up requireing to start the movie over again."
5,elf,who DOESN'T love elf? will ferrell is fantastic in it and it's fun for parents and kids. three more words.
3,Elf,"""Elf"" I enjoyed the first few and last few minutes of this more than the rest of it. It got too silly for my taste in the middle of the movie. Will Ferrell too much like a child in that part of the movie. I know he plays an elf, the title character, but it's just too silly for me. He was raised by an elf at the North Pole, then goes to find his real father when he finds out he isn't really an elf after all.I recommend it more for young children."
4,Great Family Film,"There's somethnig about Will Ferrell. About the way a man nearly 40-years-old can display such a child-like innocense without it being cloying and condescending. Don't get me wrong, there are points in this movie when it is so sickly sweet that you just have to roll your eyes. But it has such a great message about Christmas, about family, about diversity, about what is really important in life that you can overlook the sickly sweet moments and enjoy the film. Ferrell is at his best when he is playing these innocent misfits. Best of all, this is a film the entire family can sit down and watch. A few bad words may be in there, but they are so fleeting that I can't even remember what they were. This is a very enjoyable holiday film with some great moments and a lot of child-like humor."
5,Elf,"Elf is Excellent! My daughter will be thrilled, she wore out her copy. Can't believe how quickly it arrived! Great price too!"
5,Happiest movie!,"This is one of the happiest movies I've ever watched. I'm just a 20s-something person, don't have a strong opinion about Will Ferrell like others my age do - it's just happy."
4,"Funny, funny movie!",This is one of those silly movies that you just have to get a good laugh at. Have watched it several times. Love it!
4,NO DVD YET??,Can someone please explain to me why this hasn't at least been giving a release date for DVD yet. I mean this movie has been out there forever.
2,Disappointing movie,"Found the movie to be stupid humor, not very funny, an embarassment despite being recommended by several people I knew.Wonder what I missed?"
5,Elf,This is the best christmas movie ever!! Can watch it a million times and its family friendly for everyone. Will ferrel is the funniest!
5,Was exactly what I ordered and worked great!,"The Blu-Ray came sealed in its original packaging and we had no problems with it working. Picture was great, sound, was great. No problems whatsoever with this disc. Great product and I will purchase many more through Amazon.com."
5,Hysterical!,"One of my favorite Christmas movies. It's been added to the rotation with Christmas Vacation, A Christmas Story, Home Alone, Four Christmases, etc."
5,Elf,"I had not seen this movie before.I thought it was funny, cute, it had everything in it that I like to see.Its one to watch again.Great Christmas movie, great actors."
3,Will is not a bad elf.,"I rented this during the holidays this year. I think it's a nice film for the entire family with a few laughs. It's perfect to watch right around this time of year, which is exactly what I did."
5,Great buy,So i bought myslef this movie for Christmas and it was like i bought it brand new i still hav it till this day and still have had not porblems no scratching or anything! Great buy.
5,Great Christmas spirit,One of the best movies Will F. has done (it can be enjoyed with the kids) our family has watched it every year.
5,"Surprisingly entertaining. It has been accorded ""A Holiday Tradition"" status in our home.","Note: we didn't grow up watching A Christmas Story. In fact, we never learned of it until about three years ago. This may be why we don't get why *that* movie is a tradition for so many.I guess it's like Miracle Whip. If you grew up with you don't realize just how lousy it is compared to, say, mayonnaise.I'm just sayin'....:-)"
5,"An instant classic, must have Christmas movie!","I'm not sure what more I can say about this film than ROTFL! I love this movie and plan to watch it again and again, year after year! It's hilarious and has some great one-liners too! If you've never seen it yet, you're missing out!"
4,New Holiday Classic,"I discovered ""Elf"" last Christmas. It's a sweet and funny story of an orphan who was adopted by one of Santa's elves. Will Ferrel is great as the 6 foot elf. I recommend it if you love Christmas movies and are tired of the same old ones year after year."
5,Even funnier than we expected,"My wife and I are not huge Will Ferrell fans, but the movie had been recommended by friends, and we figured with a supporting cast that included James Caan, Bob Newhart, Ed Asner, Mary Steenburgen, and the marvelous singing of Zooey Deschanel, it had to be pretty good. And so it was. It's a delightfully original Christmas story with a build-up to an exciting climax in Central Park, and a perfect ending. The whole thing is an hour and a half of silly, harmless fun for the whole family.And don't miss the brief cameo appearance of Peter ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid"" Billingsley (Christmas Story) as one of Santa's elves.""Elf"" is a nice laugh-out-loud movie for Christmas or any other time a feel-good movie is what you want."
2,Great movie! Great HD picture! Volume very low.....,Love this movie and loved the price for a BluRay disk. Picture is great and definitely BluRay quality but the sound is very low/muted. We typically watch our LCD tv at a volume of about 25-30....with this movie we have to turn it up to around 80 for it to be the average volume we would watch any other BluRay disk. Not a huge deal but I was disappointed with the sound quality. It also scares the hell out of everyone when you forget to turn the volume down when switching back to tv programs!!!
4,My favorite cheerful christmas movie,"Elf and Bad Santa - that's really all you need to get you through the November to January period of having to constanly listed to sappy christmas music everywhere you go. A viewing of Elf turns my 'Bah Humbug' into ""Merry Christmas!""."
5,Elf DVD-2 Discs,"Fast delivery! My FAVORITE Christmas movie! So funny! (Does someone need a hug?) lol Plus, if you buy this edition, you get to choose inside between the wide screen and full screen discs, which is nice."
4,Great Family Christmas Movie,"Hard to go wrong with Will Ferrell in this role; safe for kids of all ages; goofy, but good fun."
5,One of the best modern Christmas movies!,The movie is for the whole family. It is fun and uplifting and gets you in the spirit of Christmas!
4,Will Ferrell's Christmas movie,"To really enjoy this movie, you must be over 70 years of age, or under 16 years of age. The old timers will enjoy spotting the characters from television of 40 years ago, and young people will enjoy the plot line."
5,Smiling is my favorite!,"This may be my new favorite movie. Will Ferrel is fantastic - the music is wonderful, and I could not stop watching it over and over!"
4,A funny holiday movie,"Elf is a very well done holiday comedy. I thought the story of a human being raised by elves and then returning to his rightful father was clever and there are many very funny scenes. I know a lot of people like or dislike this movie depending on whether they like or dislike Will Ferrell. I had no opinion going in as this was the first of his movies I had seen and I don't watch Saturday Night Live. I thought he was very funny and was just about perfectly cast in this role. Some people say his character was too stupid. Well, he wasn't a bright light, but I think his actions were driven more by naivete than stupidity and that's how the movie leads you to the Christmas spirit that's at its core."
4,All a matter of perspective,"I saw this with my entire family and everyone loved it. We've bought the DVD. I have read some professional reviews blasting the film as everything from dumb to creepy (Creepy because a man (Will Ferrel) that old acting the way he does. Excuse me, knock, knock, hello McFly anyone home? The character was raised by ELVES!) I say look at the box office receipts of many films that professional critics have chewed up. You find they are inversly proportional. The bottom line is context. If you still have enough of an inner-child to accept the base storyline, this film is good. It will make you laugh, cry and everything in between. If you cannot accept the premise of the story then stay away."
5,"Will Ferrel, genious!","Elf is one of the most delightful movies to come out to date, Christmas time or not. Will Ferrel is a comic genious, the rest of the cast deliver a perfect ""10"" in entertainment. Life should be filled with joy and fun. Elf will leave you feeling delightfully smiling. Great for grownups or kids (as long as you're not too serious, in which case, you need to watch it twice!)."
3,Endearing But Uneven,"Elf is an endearing, smart, and fun film that the whole family can enjoy. However, the movie is uneven at times. The Movie is very interesting and keeps you focused, then the film goes into a whole different direction sometimes. This Movie is quite enjoyable though. A Nice Little Holiday Family Film."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An uninspired, formulaic comedy featuring a nuetered, family-friendly Will Farrell, Elf offers a few amusing gags, a sweet performance by Zooey Deschanel, and little else."
5,The greatest film on the face of the Earth!!!,"If you need to buy a present for someone, and if they really like to laugh, I think you should buy the movie Elf for them. And, If you just want a movie for yourself, you might want to rent or buy the greatest movie on the face of the Earth... ELF!!!"
1,I did not order...,"I don't know where this came from. I did not rent this video on Amazon but yet it shows up, and says I have a 48 hour rental but it gives me 5 days?"
5,Great movie,"Elf is a awesome movie. Great to watch anytime of the year and it's good for the whole family, we love it"
5,Awesome Movie.,"This move is so funny we had to have it in our collection of classic Christmas movies. I had it recorded from the TV and our entire family watches this movie every year but we are tired of the commercials so we bought it. The format works perfectly on our 55"" Samsung TV."
5,Best Christmas Movie since A Christmas Story,It was very good quality and shipped promptly. Thanks!Now I never have to go another christmas without watching because I own it!
3,Nice family holiday movie,"Great funny, holiday movie for the family. Not too long, typical ending but funny moments. Will Ferrell keeps the laughs coming and Ed Asner is a great Santa.Silly without crossing any lines."
4,7 year old stamp of approval!,"My daughter was home sick from school and getting incredibly bored with tv, games, etc. Decided to pick a holiday movie that we could watch together. She picked Elf. I've seen it before and enjoy Will Ferrel's character, but it was much more fun seeing my daughter react to it!Not sure if it was the movie or my wireless dvd player, but about 3/4 of the way through, it stopped. I was able to get it going again, but not until I backed completely out of the movie and then resumed playing it. Guessing it was my machine though!"
5,My favorite all time Christmas movie!,I just love this movie! I have a 16 year old and a 3 year old that also love it! You just cannot go wrong with Will Ferrell & Christmas!
5,So fun!!,Love this movie!! Always brightens my day!!! Instant holiday classic!!! Elf always helps me get in the holiday spirit by singing loud for all to hear!
5,Kid favorite,"My kids have been watching this movie since it came out, and now even at 14 & 16yrs old, it's still a movie we enjoy watching as a family and having a laugh."
3,Elf - Fine For Children,Obviously created for a younger audience...which is fine but I was expecting more laughing out loud than I received. It's still worth the watch if you can't find Christmas Vacation.
5,Hilarious!!!,"I absolutely love this movie - It is Christmas! The music, the scenes, the jokes! Plus the fact Ralphies is in it!"
4,Not a bad Christmas movie,"I tend to like Will Ferrel's movies even though they go over the top at times and while this movie does that too at times, it just isn't as funny as some of his other films. However, as a Christmas movie it is actually a pretty good one that I could imagine watching around Christmas time.Humour mixed with a feel good ending make it open to most of the family unlike some of Will's other films which you wouldn't want your kids to see."
3,"""Why didn't I like this movie more?""","I really went into this movie expecting to like it a lot more than I actually did. I am such a huge fan of Will Ferrell from his ""SNL"" days. And I just happen to love Christmas movies! I even like Jon Favreau, who directed the movie. But watching it, I began to realize that the movie is just simply ""missing"" something. Ferrell is funny enough, but just so. There are a few scenes that made me laugh out loud, but I was expecting to laugh a lot more often. Some of the situations just feel ""forced"". Plus, I just never cared about some of the characters in the movie. Overall, I was left feeling a bit let-down after viewing this one, especially since I'm such a big fan of the star and director."
3,cute but not great,"This is a cute, lighthearted holiday movie - good for younger kids. Older kids will think it is pretty lame. Some adults might think so too - as it is somewhat silly.It's not bad, Will Ferrel does a good job, and he is quite funny and entertaining, it's just the rest of the cast isn't all that great."
1,Just not funny,"We might be the only family that doesn't like this movie, but my husband and I rented on Amazon for our kids, since we saw it in the theaters years ago. and didn't like it. We thought maybe our 6 and 7 year old would like it though, since all their friends do. Well, they didn't like it either. Could just be our sense of humors are different, but it's not our type of funny. We love the Santa Clause movies and other Christmas movies. Hope you enjoy!"
2,average,"while this film had some moments it is so scattered that it just didn't work for me.I thought it tried so hard to take on so many issues&left itself short in the end.the sentiment was nice,but the film just got lost in the end after trying to be so much at all times."
5,Elf with Will Ferrell,"This movie is hilarious!Rented on Amazon, after watching it I decided to put this on my purchase list.Great family movies are hard to find. Thank you Will Ferrell for all the laughs!"
5,Great family Christmas movie,"Such a great modern Christmas story.Super Family and small child friendly for its lack of darkness and evil,its heart warming story and humor..."
5,Bought this for my wife.,My wife loves this move. Now she can love it in Bluray. Movie came when it was promised. I'm very happy.
3,Wife purchased,"My wife has never seen this movie and rented it. I don't think that will happen again, I tried to warn her that it was an ok movie that will probably be on regular tv 50 times this season. But convenience won out."
5,"Great Movie, can't wait to own it!!!","I went into this movie with an open mind, I came out with a new favorite movie. I laughed till I cried. This is the first time I have actively tried to find out when I can buy a movie. I loved it. I can't wait to see it again.Will Ferrell does an outstanding job. He is perfect for the role. His sincerity is perfect. No one else could have pulled off this role as well as he did. He answers the phone with ""What's your favorite color?"" Just thinking about how he did it still makes me laugh all these months later.Great movie for anyone who still has their inner kid alive and kicking. And it might even be wake up call for a few who thought their inner kid was long gone."
5,The Funniest Will Ferrell Can Be And Still Get A PG Rating,"I thought it would be hard for Will Ferrell to top his hilarious performance in Old School. I thought wrong. Ever since I first saw this movie in the theaters last year, I have been waiting for this DVD to come out. This is proof that Mr. Ferrel can carry a whole movie on his charisma alone. My friends and I went into the movie not expecting much (not unlike Old School), but we walked out in tears, holding our sides from laughter.Not gonna say no more 'cause I don't want to inflate anyone's expectations, but I did love this movie. I'm not surprised that they waited till the holiday months to release it, but I did wish they would have done it sooner.Prepare for a full 95 minutes of lunacy (that is, if you can stand Will Ferrell for that long, which I can). Enjoy! : )"
4,Better than the usual ho-ho-ho fare,"Well, this is probably one of the most hackneyed genres, and it would have very easy for the producers to follow the formula, make their holiday profits, and move on. Fortunately, they did not, and this is a surprisingly intelligent and funny film. Fans of the many 'Norelco' Santa TV specials [e.g. 'Rudolph'] will be delighted at the thinly veiled nods to Burl Ives and the misfit toys. Good for a matinee with the kids, or a date with a significant other who has not lost their sense of wonder with life."
3,Will Farrell shines as Buddy,"""Elf,"" the new Christmas family film, stars Will Farrell as Buddy, a would-be elf. It seems Buddy was an orphan who sneaked into Santa's bag, was taken to his workshop, and adopted by elf Bob Newhart. Now Buddy is grown up, and he goes to New York City to meet his biological father (played by James Cann), and the predictable problems of an innocent elf in the big city begin.Parts of this movie are very likeable: Will Farrell is charming and likeable as Buddy. Bob Newhart is equally loveable and funny as the Papa Elf. Ed Asner was an odd choice as a grumpy, cold, and definitely not jolly, Santa Claus. James Cann is dull as Buddy's biological father, a serious, unscrupulous children's book publisher. The middle section of the movie, which focuses on Cann's business problems, was tedious for me. Will Farrells' scenes are joyful, however, and his fans will certainly enjoy ""Elf."""
5,Very Funny great to watch with the family,This movie was one of the best movie's I saw in 2003! we went as a family and we all enjoyed it. You will laugh and never get bored.
5,"Honestly, one of the best Christmas movies ever (yes, even w/ Will Ferrell in it)",I try to watch this every Christmas. It always makes me laugh out loud and makes me cry.Truly a great Christmas movie for all ages. Hilarious in many ways. When you watch it again you'll find yourself laughing at new things.
5,Modern Christmas Classic,"This is one of the only modern Christmas classics. Hilarious, sweet, charming! A must watch every year! Zooey Deschanel looks so young!"
4,Great Christmas Film-Will Be A Classic!,"Someday this movie will be looked back on as a holiday classic. Fun and smart. Will Ferrell at his best. It's colorful, hopeful, and actually shows just how great it can be to believe in something.My 4 year old daughter has watched this film about 15 times since last Christmas. I'm upgrading to blu-ray for this can't miss Christmas classic."
4,One of my favorite Christmas movies,"The holiday season is not complete unless I've watched Elf. It's a silly, fish-out-of-water tale about a man who works at the North Pole, thinks he's an elf, and then when he realizes he's a human, goes to New York City to find his real dad. It's quoteable, fun, and appropriate for all ages."
4,Great movie,Not Oscar material but an awesome holiday movie! Many laugh out loud moments. I let my 9.5 year old watch and while he didn't completely understand the humor it was good clean stuff. There was one part with some drinking but as far as I can remember that would be the harshest thing an older elementary school kid would see. As for adults....very funny!!
4,Very funny,"This was a funny, heart warming movie. I found myself singing along with the people in Central Park and rooting for Santa to get his sleigh up and running."
5,Wonderful Christmas movie,"I didn't previously consider this movie in my 'classics' category, but having watched it now the last 2 Christmas seasons, its charm and story have grown on me. Cute and appropriate for most families this makes a great addition to my 'must see' movies during the Christmas season."
5,"This has become a ""must watch"" for the Christmas season","Will Ferrell does his man-child schtick here, but he doesn't take it too far, and it's charming and quite funny. Recommended!"
3,Funny even if not during christmas Season,Plenty of laughs and has a heart warming undertone. Appropriate for all ages from what I recall. My kids loved it!
3,Needed a Different Lead,"I was induced to watch this after a friend posted quotes on facebook the entire month of December. I generally don't like Will Ferrell movies, but the quotes were funny enough that I decided to give it a try. The writing was very good, and the story was entertaining. Will Ferrell, however, was again too grating for me to enjoy. If you like his movies, then you will probably like this. I would have preferred a different actor be the lead, and it would have been an excellent movie with a young Robin Williams."
4,funny!,"I'm not really a Will Ferrel fan, but I liked this movie! It doesn't have the typical Will Ferrel stuff in it, but he was still funny. Its one of those stories where the character is out of place, which are always funny."
4,Fun for the whole family.,"Elf is a fun family movie that the entire family could really go do. Will Ferrell is great as the oversize elf who looks for the family he never knew and like all Xmas comedies, trouble always follows. James Caan also gives a good performance as well as Ed Asner and Bob Newhert. Take your kids and have a good time."
4,Total Gym 1700 Club,"I really like this for working out in the house. Gives a good light to moderate workout, which is perfect for toning and some strength building. I really like the convenience. Only difficulty is getting the pulley system unhooked for some of the exercises that don't require it."
5,Easy to Use,Total Gym 1700 Club was exactly what I needed. It is easy for older people to use and still get a good workout.
1,very disappointed,"The sleeve on one of the stabilizing bars cracked and a plastic ring somewhere under the glideboard broke during my first 5 minutes. I only weigh 130 so my weight had nothing to do with it. The accessories stated that there would be 2 video's included and there are none.The instructions aren't clear to me so they would have been very helpful. I can't find a total gym web page either. I would send it back if the cost wasn't so high but I already spent enough on it. If I would have shopped around here instead of buying online I could have gotten it for $100.00 less than what I paid, which still wouldn't have been worth it but at least I could have easily returned it."
4,the total experience,"I am thirty seven year old male who has been in the military. After the military I kind of got away from a fitness regiment. I gained some weight. My height 5,4 and weight was 165. Then I joined the gym and started working out but, somedays I found it hard to get to the gym because of work and family. So I bought the Total gym 1700 from a friend. He didn't use it much so he wanted to get rid of it. The total gym is great. I have lost around 20 lbs just by using it. My strenth has improved greatly. The only downside to the machine is it does take a little time to adjust the machine when switching exercises. Besides that overall very happy. I would tell people to buy this right now."
2,Wow,"This unit was OK, until it broke and snapped at the weld!!! I was using the unit when it occurred and thankfully I wasn't injured. I was shocked when I heard the LOUD SNAP and I jumped off the unit. It had been working OK, but it was more to tone up your body rather than to build large muscles. Hopefully, Amazon and the seller will make good on the defect and ship me a new one!!! Its been a nightmare contacting the seller and trying to work this out!!!!Pissed!"
4,Total Gym 1700 Club,"Good home gym, good value. Only problem was that it was delivered broken. If I would have been home when it was delivered I would not have accepted delivery because the box was a mess, broken open and filthy. When I opened it, I prayed all the pieces were there. They were but two plastic pieces were broken. I was able to fix/gloo them back together and the gym works fine. I don't know if it left the store in this condition or if was the fault of UPS."
1,Not if you want to build muscle,"The total gym is OK if you are interested in a light aerobic-like muscular work out. However, the resistance is not nearly enough for someone looking to gain serious muscle. Although it can fold to be put away, it is heavy and not easy to move it back and forth for work outs. I've had mine for around a year, but stopped using it after a few weeks simply because I was too strong for it. But for what it's worth, it does work well, hasn't fallen apart, and may fit others' exercise goals. Bottom line is you cannot replace a gym at home."
1,We like it!,"The Product is easy to use and easy to set up. Although if you have the room I would suggest leaving it up all the time. You get a variety of work outs with this machine, I'm a stay at home Mom, and I like the light resistance training I get from it, and my Husband likes to use it for his upper body work-out, though he still needs to use free weights to keep with his personal work-out goals. I still continue to run besides using the total gym, becuase I didn't feel that my cardio was being taken care of properly. I only have one complaint with the system, I have medium length hair, and while working out, I need to keep it pulled back and tucked under my shoulders, or it becomes caught and pulled."
1,still waiting for my order to arrive,"Dont be fooled.The shipping details says ships between 3-5 days.I have been waiting for this order for 3 months and they just sent me an update that it still wont be delivered for another 2 months.THATS 5 MONTHS!!Just absurd.If it isnt rectified,i will soon cancel the order and order from a reputable company."
1,Total Gym 1700,Product did not arrive on time promised. Product arrived broken. Had to call Amazon on two separate occassions to explain the defected product because the first phonecall was apparantly not processed. Had major trouble with pick up situation.Worst order that I've ever dealt with while making a purchase online.
2,Irish Girls are Back in Town,"Found few good short stories but overall, I was disappointed by the majority of authors. Wouldn't recommend it."
2,Very funny but not worth $29 bucks,"5 stars for creative, 2 stars for value for your money.I was really expecting more. I've seen the snips from the DVD on the internet, and thought they were super funny. The DVD doesn't offer that much more to make it worth $29. It is about 20 minutes runtime - waste of money!!!!!I do think the Truth in Advertising short is incredibly creative and hysterical, but I would suggest watching the free mpg snips a few times and save your money."
5,Winterberry Dinner Plates,"I wanted a 6-place setting of this particular pattern, and did not want to purchase another 4-piece place setting (never know what to do with all those extra coffee cups). I found that these looked exactly like the 4-piece place setting I had ordered. Great purchase!"
1,awful they're barely even in the mine,"I think this movie is a bad Sean Connery movie,its about a bunch of bad miners looking like they are doing the right thing by blowing stuff up.They think they are special because they are imigrants so what we all were at some point in time, they just had bad timing.Plus Sean isnt even the real star of the movie that is a disgrace to movies, he barely even talks during the whole movie thats why it was bad, and the fact they are not in the mine long enough for people to say its a good mining movie.If you got a problem with your boss you dont kill him you ask for a raise, or if that dont work quit dont kil thats retarted.If you dont believe me watch the movie yourself although I dontthink its anygood but who am I to stop you."
2,Molly Migure: a story of coal miners,"This movie was an o.k. movie, but not one of Sean Connery's best movies ( if you know what I mean). But overall the movie would be suitable to show kindergardners, it would put them a sleep. The movie itself had a strong plot, but lacked the drama that could have made me be more interested! Im big on American History but this movie made me lose some interest in the past.This movie had alot of historical facts that put some interest in it. In this Sean Connery plays a man that tries to destroy the coal mining business in 1876. Along with other followers, they tried to break out and abolish the work of living and working in a company town. As my final review, I humbly ask you not to go rent this movie. But if you like Sean Connery Knock your self out and rent "" Molly Maguires""."
1,A bad movie,This movie shows how the Irish were treated in the mines. I personaly did not like this movie. It is not a good movie to entertain teenagers. It shows how the secret clubs the Molly McGuires rebeled against the city. But it did not work out because they had a spy in the club. At the end they all got cought.
4,Irish Imperfection,"Of course, this movie was almost as true to life as Hollywood could make it. Yes, it was very close to some of the occurrences after the civil war when the Irish were mistreated and labor unions were very understated. With Richard Harris' character trying to bust the Molly Maguires in the middle of one of their crimes, he becomes involved. Of course, this is always a plot to some Hollywood movie. While in the middle, he is now trying to save himself and the Molly Maguires. In this occurrence, I had been absent that day. To conclude from what I have seen, this was and probably is the best portrait of what happened with the Irish immigrants."
3,Don't Mine too Deep into this Story,"Sean Connery and Richard Harris star in this story of the secret society of the Molly MacGuires in 1800's Pennsylvania. Actual Pennsylvania coal field locations serve as the backdrop for this film. Richard Harris portrays an undercover detective who enters the mines in search of saboteurs. Harris' character very quickly bears witness to the cruel conditions under which the coal miners are subjected and he comes to sympathize with coal mining community. Sean Connery plays a somewhat subdued role as one of the unofficial coal miner leaders. Overall the film is more of a comment on the horrible conditions imposed on immigrant Irish coal miners than the true story of the Molly MacGuires and the sensational murder trials that concluded this era. If you are a Sean Connery fan, than you ought add this film to your collection. For historical accuracy you are better off reading a good book on the subject."
4,Secret Pack,"If I were you and I liked to learn about things that happened in the earlier days this would be a good movie for you to watch because it shows how they worked kids in the coal mines because they worked for cheep. If you are a person who likes adveture such as fights and sports and family this would be a good movie for you because it has a little bit of all of that in it. In the movie they had a group of people that went around destroying things, they had teams on Sunday after church that got togeather and played rugby,andadveture inthe movie is great but you will have to watch it yourself to find out because I dont want to be the only one with one of these things on this movie but trust me it is a wounderful movie."
4,Amazed,"In my U.S. History class we recently finished ""The Molly Maguires."" This movie is very accurate on the life of a coalminer and the wives of clans. The wages were accurate, and the working conditions were close. The mines ""halls"" weren't that tall though. Yet I understand that if they were actual size you couldn't get a camera down there."
3,Molly Maguires,Sean Connery and Richard Harris star in this story of the secret society of the Molly MacGuires in 1876 Pennsylvania. Actual Pennsylvania coal field locations serve as the backdrop for this film. Richard Harris portrays an undercover detective who enters the mines in search of people being treated un-fairly by their supervisors. Sean Connery plays a somewhat subdued role as one of the unofficial coal miner leaders. Overall the film is more of a comment on the horrible conditions that were put on the Irish Immigrant coal miners than the true story of the Molly MacGuires.
4,Molly Who?,"It isn't a what but rather a part of our nation's history. After the September 11 bombing, America has paid more attention to the history of our country. This moving helped to show us a little of how it got started. So it shows that terriorism happeded during that time as well. These people were terriorized and treateded with little respect for their hard work. It is just amazing how far the United States has come in the industrial stage. Amazing and wounderful oppurtunities exist in todays working field. I still do not understand how they could treat them with such cruel treatment because America's backbone is the working man middle class."
3,molly maguires,The movie Molly Maguires is about a secret socity that Sean Connery goes in and works in the coal mines. He gets in the Molly Maguires and don't tell them why he came there to work. He is an undercover detective that is trying to see who is being treated unfairly. My history class watched the Molly Maguires to see how they were affected.
2,Working in the dark mines,"Molly Maguires movie was in the 1876, about coal mining. This movie is about Irish miners and the hardships that they endure while working in the mines.If you like watching movies that was in the 1876 then you would like this movie.The only way I would watch this movie again would be at school.I would not watch this movie at home because I like funny,scary,and sad movies.It was a good movie but not a movie I would watch over again unless I had to. You might want to watch it and see for yourself."
2,Boring!,"This movie depicts the life of the Irish coal miners in the 1800s. I believe it is very histriocally correct. The movie in itself is very boring and I did not like it, but your not me and we may not be into the same types of movies. I really like movies that are thillers and this movie is defintly not a thiller. The only thing that held my intrest was the fight scenes. I would not advise this movie to you if you like thillers."
2,Molly Maguires,"This movie was an okay movie, if you are over the age of 50. No I was just joking. It showed how the coal mines were ran in the1870's.It showed how the workers would side with only people that were from the same country. It also demenstrated how the miners would destroy the mine so the company would have to pay extra money to fix things. Over all this was an okay movie, but I don't recommend that you see this movie unless you want to go to sleep or you have nothing else in your life to do. I mean Nothing else to do."
1,Disappointing..,"Very disappointing account of the Irish immigration experience -- poorly written, unclear, with bad acting. Surely a great actor like Sean Connery must want to forget about this one! A better option...The History Channel's DVD on the Molly Maguires offers a clear, interesting presentation of the story."
1,This Movie was HORRIBLE,"This movie gave a litle idea of what life was like for the Irish coal miners. It concentrated to much on catching the Molly Miguires, to teach me anything about the harsh conditions of the mining fields the immigrants were working in.Skinny Wiener"
2,Dark and Deep in the minds,"The Molly Maguires was an alright movie. It was not a movie that I would recommend to other people. Although Sean Connery did play a wonderful part it still wasn't a very good movie. There were a few parts that was interesting. For instance, the scene where some of the coal miners were crushed to death in the coal mine. I thought it was interesting to see if they were going to live or die. Of course, they died. The movie was set back in 1876. Sean Connery played a vicious man who tried to destroy the coal miners and their business. If you ever had trouble sleeping then this is the movie to watch. It made me fall to sleep, but like I said, there were a few interesting parts. I wouldn't never went out and rented it. Our history teacher made us watch it. I don't recommend you go out and rent it. I didn't like it but everybodys opinion is different. There are some people who might like it."
1,A bad movie,This movie is really boring to me. It was not a good movie to entertain a teenager. It did teach me how the towns were like back then in the day. It gave me a good idea of what the Isish was treated like in the mines. The movie spent more time trying to capture the Molly Mcguires.
2,Molly Maguires,"""Molly Maguires"" is set in the coal mines of Pennsylvania during 1876 and displays the unfair working conditions of the miners. Sean Connery plays the leader of the ""Molly Maguires"", Jack Kehoe. Richard Harris is an undercover detective. Harris is sent into the mines to find the miners who are working against the company. The movie has a lot of violence but it is based on true events of the day. At times it is hard to follow. But, if you enjoy history, you will enjoy this movie."
4,Great Movie,"It came in excellent condition, did not watch it because it is a gift for someone who has never seen this great movie"
5,The Molly Maguires,"OUTSTANDING MOVIE. It is about the real life Irish organization called the Molly Maguires in the Pennsylvannia coal mines who attempted to improve conditions for the miners but often used violence to accomplish their goals. The scenery is extremely realistic and the cast of characters are great. The movie really opens your eyes to the often tragic and poverty stricten lives of these people not to mention the hardshps they encountered daily due to the corrupt organization who they worked for. Stars Richard Harris and Sean Connery. IF you are not interested in the story line, watch it just to see these two wonderful actors on the screen at the same time. Who could resist that. Movie flows wonderfully and captures your attention until the end. ENJOY."
2,Molly Maguires,"Personaly I didnt enjoy Molly Maguires. Maybe it is because I do not enjoy older movies but on the other hand if you are interested in learning about the life of a coal miner during the 1870's, i do believe that you would enjoy this movie. This movie showed how coal miners were treated and what the conditions were in the mines, thier homes and after work during this time. I do not think I am willig to watch tihs movie again unless i needed to."
3,"Bring the pillows when you watch, becase you may need them!","This movie was about the coal miners at Penn. and the bosses. The Molly Magnires are showing what they want done, by blowing up building. It was not a very good movie, but is a good movie to show, if you want to learn on how the workers and the bosses get along with each other back then.If you are not sleeping at night then just pop this movie in and you can fall in to a long sleeping night while you learn about the history of how our company workers get along with each other and their bosses."
2,i dont recommend seeing ths movie unless you are Irish,The Molly Maguires is a movie that takes place in 1876 on an American coal mining town. The movie stars Sean Connery and co-stars Richard Harris. Sean Connery plays an Irish coal miner by the name of Jack Kehoe. He is the leader of an underground mining terrorist group. Richard Harris plays Irish man by the name of James McKenna/McParlan. Who is hired as a detective to rat out the Molly Maguires. I think the movie was well thought out just did not appeal to me. With visual aid it totally explained what Irish work life was like when they got to Ameica.
2,to whom it may concern,This movie was all right. Because it had some fight scenes in it and the fact that the people in this movie cause havic. I think it is pretty awsome and how they burned the building(s) down and stuff. But other that this movie wasn't all that great.
5,Roonie,"We live in Bangor, Pa. and love to go to Jim Thorpe, Pa. We have toured the jailwhere the Molly Maquires were hung. We are also Irish and found this movie phenominal."
1,Wrong Measurements and Very Dark,"I was sent a poster that measured 19"" x 13"". It is too dark to see the details of the painting. Notice how the original has a lot of blue tones, hence a water scene. This poster was printed as though through a red filter. The blues look black and the yellows are orange. What I got is not what I paid for."
5,A wacky contest--with a bridegroom as the prize,"Mail-order bride Lolly leaves behind everyone she knows to marry a stranger. But the path to love is not easy. The town's Ladies Helpful Society is staging a contest--and Lolly must compete against two other determined brides-to-be to win the prize: the groom. I enjoyed this light-hearted fun book for its resourceful heroine and her relationships with the other two ""brides."" All the women are fully realized, with strengths and weaknesses and sympathetic qualities. Contrary to real life, everyone gets what she deserves in this book, so one finishes reading with a sigh of satisfaction."
2,Not that good of a book,"I have to admit, Dragons of War is not that good of a book. I love the Bazil Broketail series but this book is just boring. I was asleep through almost the whole thing. One of the only parts that i liked was with the Purple Green, the wild dragon that bazil was in love with, and Bazil because they r the people u can understand! The other characters use big words that are hard ta understand. I recommend Bazil Broketail and Dragons of Argonath."
4,My New Home,"After having moved to Southeast Missouri, I was fascinated by this book, which I found in an antique shop. (Autographed by the author, no less.) It gave me a much greater appreciation for the land, and especially for the old timers."
4,Don't bash it,"I like both Marty Haugen and David Haas. Their music brings a sense of peace and sernity. I have two cousins that play for them also, and both will be involved with the ordination when that time comes."
5,This book was a real page turner.,This book was really intense and you didn't want to put it down. Between the war and the love story it was very surprising and interesting. This is the only trilogy that I have read where the third book is as good or better then the first.
1,Awful,"This book is even worse then the first two books, INTO THE WIND and SONG OF THE SEA. This book is an insult to the American Dreams series. Don't buy this book - it is a waste of money! Don't even borrow it or get it from a library - it's a waste of time!"
5,Excellent pair of gloves!,"Have to say, these are an excellent value and and excellent pair of gloves over all. They are thin, there's a lot of tactile feedback when using them, but they are still thick enough to offer good protection. These are just a hair thicker than the Mechanix gloves, but they are otherwise pretty similar. Not sure which would last longer with hard use, but they are both very good, high quality gloves. They are also very easy on the eyes and look clean and simple, something that seems to be hard to find in mechanics gloves these days.I haven't seen these in a lot of places so I was hesitant at first to try them, but they are great gloves and definitely worth picking up. I'm very happy with my purchase and may order another pair before long, just so I can save them for when these wear out."
4,"An easy to follow, but very informative book for all levels.","This book covers the main issues of Limnology, and compiles them into an easy to read, well descriptive text. Also includes good diagrams for the more complicated aspects. Suitable for those with a fair knowledge of Biology and Chemistry."
1,Zero stars,I looked forward to this cd for weeks until I received it and none of the songs were the originals. I would give it zero stars if that was an option.
1,DONT BUY,"ifd you are looking for a good country cd this is not the one!!! it is not done buy the original artists it is all covers....dont waste your money, it is definetly not worth it."
1,IT'S JUNK -- DON'T BUY IT,"Oh, how I wish I'd read the reviews. This is all *cover* versions of popular country tunes. Nothing wrong with the performers, and they mostly do a good job of faking it. But it's not the songs by the original artists, and the tracks often lack the energy and dazzle of the original. Save your money!!"
3,BEWARE - FALSE ADVERTISEMENT,"What you see in the picture is NOT what is being sold.READ the description carefully; what is being sold is a 10-KEY CABINET. What you see in the picture is a 60-key cabinet, which costs $115.For those of you who is willing to do some haggling with Amazon, and get a $115 item for the $31.55 you could buy the 10-key cabinet, and when you receive it, you will be within your rights to contact Amazon and demand a replacement for what is shown in the picture.Just make sure that you get a detailed printout of what is shown in the picture (by getting a PDF print of complete description of the item), so that you can prove your case.Update 10/29/2011:I see that either manufacturer or the Amazon.com have replaced the image with the correct one. It is now correctly showing a 10-Key cabinet. Hence I've changed my rating from original one star to three stars."
2,A very simplistic view of melanoma and treatment of same.,"As a stage IV melanoma patient, I found this book to be overly simplistic in its views and treatment of melanoma. I have never heard a doctor say it is ""totally curable"" as it can show up many years later with even a different primary, but yet this book states if ""caught early it can be totally cured."" The book is a good basis for someone that is just wanting to learn about melanoma but not do serious research. This book could be better if it spent more time researching the genetics of melanoma and less time concentrating totally on the sunscreen aspect of melanoma. Many patients that are not ""sun worshipers"" or have not had sun burns still contract melanoma."
5,Excellent for understanding what melanoma is.,"This book was very helpful in explaining what melanoma is, what questions to ask my doctor and what the answers meant. It was recommended that I have some ""suspicious"" moles checked and read the book to gain a better understanding of what they were looking for and the consequences of what might be found. As a layman it's hard to know where to begin and what you should be asking. This book gave me the answers - I strongly recommend it."
2,SKB Mackie Bag,"Purchased two of these for Mackie 450s. Flimsy design. After minimal usage, about one job a month, top handle ripped. Wheels are flimsy and are out of alignment and broken. I puchased a EVI hard case for them and am eager for when it arrives."
5,Works as advertised,"If you need this, buy this unit. Does exactly what it is supposed to, comes with solid screws, perfect fit. Arrived quickly and well packed."
2,Much less than expected.,This is info given to me by my wife about her experience :Uncomfortable. The waist dug into her hips. The absorption was no better than store branded guards she had used before. She ultimately got a rash. She felt these needed changing 4-5 times a day. More than twice her average changing. She was extremely unhappy. The price and name reflects what is expected to be real quality. These do not fullfill that expectation.
1,Did not delivered as advertized,"As advertized, I ordered the case of 80 Invacare underwear at the listed price of $13.15, plus $8.95 Shipping and Handling. I received one package of 20. I have been unable to correct the transaction and feel like I have been ripped off!"
5,Loved this,"I read Adyashanti's book ""Emptiness Dancing"" and was immediately intrigued by his style of teaching. I listened to these CDs gradually over a month or so and learned something new every step of the way. Highly, highly recommended."
4,Nice targets,"These are nice targets for the price, I paid $50 for 100 targets. The only negative is that the paper is very thin and the targets tend to rip very easy whether you staple or tape them to your target frame on windy days or from the force of impacts. Blue color makes the target realatively easy to see at longer ranges as well but bullet impacts are very difficult to see at any range past 25 yards or so (these are not glow targets)"
4,Modern Classical,"Ever wonder what will happen to Classical music in the modern age? Well, someone like Mozetich will write what I think of as modern, classical music, reminiscent of Impressionism and Debussy, perhaps, and thoroughly enjoyable. Great for a wistful walk through the park with birch trees rustling their leaves."
5,Best cookbook in my collection,"This is one of those cookbooks that you can pick up hours before a dinner party, open it to any page, make the dish and have rave reviews. There are VERY few dishes in here that aren't good.This is an older cookbook, but definitely worth looking into adding to your collection!"
3,cool but slow,"i bought this so I could play form bed. I can, but it's slow reacting. When i playedStar Wars Battlefront IIthe gun would fire 2 seconds late or not at all. The thing looks damn cool and fits my small hands but i guess intec sacrificed quality for appeal."
3,Pretty good book for the experienced traveler,"Fairly informative book for people who have some spare time or have already been to these places mentioned in the book and want to explore the unique establishments in each city. Best italian eatery, best little bookshop, best spa, etc. It also includes some great airport tips.However, for most travelers (like myself), I am not driving out of my way to drop off my clothes to be dry cleaned @ a recommended dry cleaners chain in Las Vegas, or go to some kickboxing joint in Houston, or go get my hair done @ a hairdresser joint in Cairo, Egypt. Get Real!!!Take my advice: Buy ""The Travel Detective: How to Get the Best Service and the Best Deals from Airlines, Hotels, Cruise Ships, and Car Rental Agencies"" book and that is all the info you will need to survive in today's traveling environment."
4,Excellent road guide,"This is an excellent road guide for Chile and Argentina (maybe the best), very accurate distances. Cities and some geographic aspects like lakes, parks and mountains. I can't say the same for the Brazilian part of it, many roads are not available. Don't expect to find hotels, restaurants and attractions from this atlas since It's specialized in maps."
5,Excellent!,As with all the Masterclass series this book is excellent. I highly recomend this book to anyone wishing a deeper knowledge of tomonage combinations and counters. May be too much info without the basic tomonage foundation.
5,Some Day Soon Going With You,In 1963 Ian and Sylvia burst on the folk scene from Canada. This CD captues their best hits. The duo broke up but Ian continues to write and sing to this day...Gordon Lightfoot has several of Ian's hits on his best songs! Ian was named the top Western Singer of the Century a few years ago. Start your journey as a fan...it is worth your time.
3,"If you like Ian and Sylvia, get this","The quality of the recordings on this CD are fairly good. Some of the songs are also well written. However, I could just not get in to the actual songs. I just did not seem to like the sound of the vocals. Also, the male and female vocals just did not seem to fit together for me."
2,"Once an Excellent Resource, but Out of Date Now","I read this book years ago as a part of my preparation to become an LLL Leader, and it was very thorough and a great read. But now, sadly, so much has happened in the field of lactation that this book is really out-of-date, and I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. Luckily, the author, Nancy Mohrbacher, has written a newer version called Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple, which was published in 2010. I highly recommend that anyone interested in the Breastfeeding Answer Book purchase Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple. Same author, same concept, but so much more up-to-date."
5,The best all inclusive breastfeeding book!,"I have read other books and this by far is the BEST one I have come across. It answers ANY question or concern I may have. I have found the answers I need in a matter of minutes and even when health professionals haven't a clue what to tell me. It has great information about pumping and storing breastmilk, what medications affect/don't affect your breastmilk, and so many other things that have helped me. This book is written like a textbook and instead of saying ""you"", it refers to you as ""the mother."" It is very easy reading, and I recommend this to a first time breastfeeder or a mom like myself who has breastfed before but didn't have all the information I needed. The book was very encouraging and interesting!"
2,"Cumbersome, not easy to search or read","I was looking for something that would be informative and go over the how-tos and problems of breastfeeding step by step. This is a giant book, and is like a complicated encyclopedia... it must be designed for La Leche League leaders who have been trained to use it as a reference guide??? Not helpful for the every day mom."
1,Installation CD Driver INOP,"I just bought my mini keyboard for my Dell Axim X50v and both the installation CD and Belkin website driver download do not work. Spoke to a Belkin Tech support person and they said that no other software is available for me to use. Also received an email from Belkin Tech Support stating ""The F8D0502 was only designed for the original Axim X50 and X51. Unfortunately the F8D0502 does not work with the new Axim X50v and X51vmodels."" Installing other software for my axim works fine but this program. Oh well, guess i'll have to just return it. So inconvenient..."
2,Thick and covers the Axim shortcuts,"First off let me state that I don't use this keyboard anymore. The thumbkey keyboard is too thick for my Axim carrying case and I didn't like the way it covers up so much of the shortcut buttons at the bottom of the Axim. Secondly, let me mention that I don't really *hate* this keyboard, just that for me the iGo Stowaway fits the bill much better. Even though the iGo is a ""real"" keyboard, as opposed to a thumb-keyboard, I can fold it up and carry it with my Axim in the carrying case.The thumb keys on the Belkin do not allow quick typing. It is like you really have to mush-down on the key to make it respond. I was not as happy with this as I thought I would be. But it does work as advertised."
3,Nifty add-on for Axim,"This ""thumb board"" is much better then the built-in (on screen) keyboard.Con: It requires an extra travel bag to go along with your Axim."
1,Received the wrong size shoe,The shipping was excellent. It got here in record time. It would have been nice if it had been my order. I received the wrong size shoe. When I contacted the company they said they had them in stock. I still haven't received the return label and have contacted them multiple times. I won't order from them again.
2,Book is hand written,I did not realize the book would be hand written and not typed. I found it very hard to read because of that. I also wished it had an index. I think there are better resources to lean about drying food.
3,It's about the making money!!!!!,"I,have watched this dvd,several times.It is a step in the right direction,about understanding Women, and men. And yes sex and relationships. But, I have heard better conversations, about the same subjects at the Barber shop. I have had better conversations with Co-worker's and friend associates. Micheal and George, should not do the dvd. The women seemed to much like they wanted too get with them. So the answer's they gave to the topic's seemed more if it was( Micheal and George) this would be my answer. Last I won't say it's worth buying. But let someone else spend there cash. Unless you are shy about talking about life."
5,An Eye Opener,"This relationship film is a real eye opener into the minds of the sexes, what motivates each gender and what we really want. Its easy to think we have our own individual craziness (which of course we do!) but its also very interesting to know there are other women thinking the EXACT same things I'm thinking when it comes to searching for the right relationship. I think we speak English and men hear Greek, which is shown in detail with the real life conversations. But we need and want each other which is what I got from this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it!"
2,Bad Buy,I should have KEPT MY MONEY...This documentary wasn't interesting OR informative at all! I watced it with friends and ALL OF US agreed that it sucked!
4,Funny & real,"I enjoyed the commentaries from everyone. Learned some stuff not only about men and how they process and think about certain relationship issues, body type, etc. I did learn a few things I could change about myself which is always good. Great job Michael."
4,"A little ""out there"" but overall really intersting","Overall, I really enjoyed this book. It gave me pause to think of a different perspective and parts of it really hit home. Interesting concept and something that makes you think."
2,Not What I Expected,I hope I didn't give up on this book too early but the author seems so self absorbed and his concept of God so vague as to have no real substance. I do believe the less fortunate are gifts from God and provide us a road map and the opportunity to gain eternal happiness. This book didn't provide that insight (at least not quick enough) and got weighed down with the author's own issues that came across to me as whining.Any reason to pick it up and try again?
1,I should have read the Publisher's Weekly summary,"I have to say that Publisher's Weekly put it mildly when they called the author's credibility strained by his reliance on anecdotal stories and explanations of telepathy. Let me make this clear, this book is not a reliable resource on autism or any serious aspect of it. It is a collection of superstitious claims used to glorify autism and connect it to a fabricated world. While it may have some use to boost self-esteem of the newly diagnosed, I honestly can't imagine any other reason for a rational person to buy this book."
4,autism and the God connection,"It's a very good book, but instead of Autism maybe they can use a different word 'cause talks about different diagnoses."
5,The best baby book ever!,"This was both of my children's favorite book when they were a baby. They loved saying ""uh-oh"" and asking why the baby was crying. The pictures are so whimsical and fun. And I love the fact that it tells them that Mommy, Daddy, and Jesus love them. I'm so sad it's out of print! I wanted to give it for a baby gift!"
4,Delightful,"Small and easy to read,this little book offers a refreshing perspective on decorating. What he says may not be new, but the way he says it is. He addresses common problems and offers direct advice while also making us laugh at ourselves. An earlier reviewer missed the point when he/she said the book seemed ""aimed at people who live in ideal houses with some old style charm or super modern chic."" Wrong! I already have gotten so many ideas for my suburban home and for my sister's ordinary townhouse. The author helps you put YOURSELF in the rooms, and that, not the architecture, is what will give your rooms real style."
4,"A good, solid read","Turtledove's take on the ""Prime Directive"" philosophy is well worth reading. Good characters and an interesting story keep this book moving along."
3,gets good at the end,"When I read this I kind of got a Foundation meets Star Trek TNG feel, although let it be known that this book was written a couple of years before the beginning of TNG. There's lots of politics, except you never really get to see the effects of interferance on Bilbeis 4. That's why the end is the most interesting. I don't know if Turtledove was trying, ut he has made the best case against noninterference that I have ever seen. Bilbeis 4 was advancing very quickly because of their progressive queen and was probably soon to join man among the stars. I mean how would you like it if you finally got to the stars and all the good planets were already taken? The best thing to do would be to help primitive planets."
2,Pretty mediocre compared to Harry's best work,"The first thing you'll think of reading this minor novel is ""Prime Directive,"" even though it has nothing to do with Star Trek. The Survey Service keeps an eye on pre-technological civilizations, with a strict hands-off policy, but a member of one team takes pity on the personable ruler of a Sumer-like culture and gives her something to cure her cancer. Unfortunately, when the next survey team comes back 1,500 years later, they find the queen is still alive and her kingdom is far ahead of where it reasonably ought to be. The Survey Service has political enemies who would like to see it shut down, and this is all the ammo they would need. And at that point, this turns into a lightweight version of a John Grisham chase story, with a bloodyminded bureaucrat committing mass murder to protect her budget. Speaking as a professional semi-bureaucrat myself, the author is way over the top on this one. I didn't find it believable at all, not even on its own terms."
2,Didn't do much for me,"I enjoyed the concept of this book but the pace was too jumpy, the characters too flat, and the overall story was ultimately rather dull."
3,Shop manual for intermidiates.,An excellent shop manual covering what I used it for - the pontiac 1968 grand prix. Would recommend.
2,Jaws Unleashed not for Australia!,It would probably be a good product but it can't be played in Australia. Had to return the game.
4,Bloody brilliant!,"I thought this game was hilarious, fun, but also hard sometimes. I beat the game, but that required an online walkthrough for a couple parts. Anyways, this game is great because you can go around and eat people, dogs, sharks, and even alligators. You also have special destructive moves like body slamming boats, whipping your tail, and a barrel-roll. My favorite is either shooting a person from your mouth and eating them in mid air or wacking a person with your tail into the air and their bodies explode. It's violent, fun, and has a somewhat decent story line/game play. I wouldn't pay over $20 for it, but if you want a fun game with not bad graphics and where you can wreak havoc everywhere you go, then go buy this game or at least rent it."
3,Controls Suck,"The only thing keeping me from fully enjoying this game is sucky control directions. It's difficult to move the shark where you want it moved and tight spaces like a shipwreck is a hassle to get in and out of - hassle=not fun. If you're moving too close to the surface of the water you'll bob in and out of the water and the rapidly changing camera angles just confuse further.If you have no patience you may not want buy this game as you'll end up quitting after half-an-hour or so due to frustration. Otherwise, this is awesome."
4,controls great/controls bad?,"This isn't going to be much of a review but I noticed something strange, one reviewer had said that the controls were great and another said they were terrible and unresponsive. I wonder if this might have something to do with older PS2s vs. the newer models. Is it possible that this game could work better in newer PS2s and horrible in the earlier models? I'VE EXPERIENCED THIS ON SOME GAMES. Just a thought because for one person to say the complete opposite of another on something that isn't really an opinion leads me to think that's what it could be."
2,Too much of a good thing,Like many people who have been through gallbladder surgery I wound up with digestive problems after the fact. Insufficient bile left my digestive pH level too acidic. I tried this product to add some bile back into my system and let me digest my food more normally. The bottle said to take 1 a day and that's what I did. Despite some queasy feelings after the first dose I did get good results. On the second day I got results which were worse than not having the product at all. This dosage (432 mg per pill) is just far too much for me to handle. The other bile salt pills that I see on Amazon are all less than this amount so I think that maybe I'm not the only one who can't handle such a large amount.
5,Pure gold!,"I must confess I listened this outstanding CD yesterday night with some friends who -from time to time - accustome to share our little musical treasures. My surprise was majuscule at the moment Aldo (the owner of the album) decided to reproduce it.All the tracks are first class achievements. But in major degree the concerto for violin and oboe as well the concerto for two mandolins.Due the album was released on 1986, I'm aware it's hard to get it, but if you know someone in a little village or a great store, is about to see this memorable recording, don't think it twice and buy it.A real acoustic gem, al the way through."
1,A definite Bulwar-Lytton Award Winner,"For violence, it rates a 5. For triteness, it rates a 5. It is a bloody, cliche-driven piece of drivel."
1,"Sorry Rob, better luck next time",I also looked forward to this book and ordered it in advance. I agree that the publishers made a mistake with their hype. It probably did more harm than good. I am amazed at the way publishing works! There are so many talented authors who never get published and then there are those who write something like this and get published.
1,My Endowed Contempt Knows No Bounds,"At first, I thought it was interesting, if a little shlocky. (Let's see: four women, so one has to be brunette, one blonde, one a red head, and let's thow in someone Asian just to round it out. Cue the canned soft-porn music!)But by the end of the second chapter, I began to realize that I had something especially bad here. This man is, simply put, a bad writer. A really, really, bad writer. It doesn't matter if it's Fantasy, mystery, non-fiction, what have you: poor grammar, misused words, and plain miserable logic (the symmetry and simplicity of a 3-winged bird?) become nothing short of agonizing. I've read some low-class, derivative SF&F before, but this may well be the worst ever. Perhaps the worst book regardless of genre.I can't even say nice try, Newcomb, 'cause my endowed blood won't permit it.Geez!"
2,"The most famous ""eyebrows""....","If I hear that the wizard ""arched his famous eyebrow"" one more time, I think I'll slit my wrists... let me help Mr. Newcomb out here:-The wizard looked at him skeptically...- `' `' `' `' `' ...cryptically...- `' `' `' `' `' ... with disbelief ...- Surprise showed on the face of the wizard...- etc.If I were the sorceress, my first method of torture would be to staple his friggen eyebrow down!Newcomb earns points with his visuals and some concepts.Making women evil, torture, sex... none of this bothers me. The poor writing does. It seems as though Wigg's ponderous explanations of everything are necessary to cover holes in writing.The end was fairly anti-climatic...akin to a firecracker going off in their hand... oops they're all dead! Creation of the minions...crap- gene splicing and time enhancements!?Where did the feathered minions come from!? Feathers vs. Bat wings.... How does that happen?... not even the same species! Why not gills?"
1,Perhaps the worst book ever written in the English language,"Thoroughly, utterly, relentlessly, inconceivably awful. I can't imagine that anyone actually edited this book: the author's writing skills are so poor that no editor could have approved this. Grammatical errors, poorly formed sentence structure and dialog, misused words, overuse of superlatives and modifiers - and this isn't even getting into the misogyny, cheap adolescent rape-fantasy, shallow characters, derivative plot, and basic flaws in logic.If you are interested in this book, PLEASE, take it out of the library. Don't waste your money on it."
1,"I laughed, I cried",Laughably poor storytelling propped upon no-more-than average writing. Overall a book so bad it represents the tragically poor standards of today's fantasy genre.
5,The fifth Sorceress,"Since this was the first fantasy novel I have ever read, I was truly impressed with Newcomb's discriptions & imagination of his characters & was held spellbound as the pages kept turning, as It was hard to put the book down.I usually get bored with very long written books,but I really enjoyed the way this man wrote to bring everything together until the end."
3,Good,"I was surprised when I saw this book's low rating and high number of vitriolic reviews. I thought it was pretty good. I'm not much of a fantasy reader; maybe that's what my problem is. I'll grant that the writing isn't especially good in the way of word choice, and there are some logic errors, but the story still pulled me in. I liked the characters and the story and I couldn't put the book down. That's good enough for me, redundant prose notwithstanding. As for the book's 'controversial' aspects, the violence and sex didn't bother me, and I loved the fact that the villains were women.+5 stars for story, -2 stars for prose."
1,Don't buy this book,"All I can say is I am glad I borrowed this from the library. The fact that this book was released in hardcover is mind-boggling! To expect a reader to pay that kind of $$ for this garbage is really disgusting. If I could have rated this book 0 stars I would have. Cardboard characters, weak storyline, and a ...-poor world-building effort when compared with the likes of Martin, Kay, Erikson and even the vastly overrated Jordan. I cannot understand why all of the ""professional"" reviews are so laudatory. I can only surmise that some of them are in the pockets of publishers who need to watch their bottom lines on a big splashy hardcover release like this. You could walk up to the Fantasy section in any library or bookstore, close your eyes, spin 3 times and pick a better book than this one."
1,Not my type of fantasy,"I found this book to be disturbing. I agree with one of the other reviewers that depicting women - particularly strong women - as evil is an age old custom that Newcomb merely encorporated into his book. I have nothing against ""unPC"" books, but I do have something against books with old fashioned, boring themes like that. Adam = good guy and Eve = bad woman. It really didn't work for me since as a guy I get a kick out of sexy strong women, and the total evilness of the women distracted me from the few good elements of the story. Anyway, I'll not be buying Newcomb's work, or any other books printed by Del Rey after this experience. I also have to agree that the publishers really could have done better."
1,Fear of a Bad Novel,"Unquestionably the worst fantasy novel I've ever had the misfortune to come across. Ponderous writing, shallow characters, and extended bouts of violence and torture that only reveal the author's love of cruelty render this unreadable. The only fantasy novel I've ever tossed in the trash.If you want ""realistic"" fantasy with adequate sex, violence and suffering, read Robin Hobb or George RR Martin instead."
1,...,"One Newcomb needs to get himslef a woman or something, because one it seemed that he shied away from the loving aspect and focased so much on the rape aspect that it seems he has some issues with the whole thing. Two i hate the male chovinisum that he protrays by making all the men good and women bad. Sexist anyone. LOL bad writing, he should have had some evil wizards and good sorceresses. But now the way he is writing this it makes futur books even worse. I bet that most people who read this will agree when i say that almost all the characters were kinda tossed in there. It was like he never even bothered to get us set up for a good story, he just jumped in a aruined it. ... i thought it was a good book accourding to the reviews. But i wasted my money the day i bought it. Im never going to by another book by him."
1,A Simple Minded Plot,I read a few editorial reviews and thought I had made a good choice. Wrong answer. This book was not well thought out and it did not flow well. The main character (Tristan) changed his mind and attitudes back and forth so many times that I could never really get a grasp of his personality. I feel cheated out of $27.00 and cannot understand how the professional editorials supported this book. I shall pay more attention to customer reviews from now on. This book was a dud!!
1,Scarcely worth the paper it's printed on,I've read more books in this genre than I care to count. This book was terrible. I can only bring myself to waste enough of my time to say that Robert Newcomb personally owes me the $25.00 I spent on this door-stop.
1,Like a trainwreak in slow motion,"Magic is based on ""pure-bloodedness"". Thus, the most powerful in the book are also the most inbred. This book is so awful it's ALMOST a self-parody. If you find the truly awful fascinating, give this book a try."
1,Greatly Disappointed,"I picked up this book when I saw emblazoned on the cover ""Epic Fantasy of the Year"". Now that's saying something. But I have to say I was greatly disappointed in this first book by a seemingly promising author. He has taken the all of the fun and wonder out of epic fantasy, and made it into a dark and dreary realm where I doubt many people will want to linger. I thought the setup, where the sorceresses were exiled, had promise, but it quickly degenerated into a war between the sexes, and a very nasty one at that. The scene where the sorceresses' army invades our hero's homeland is gratuitious, far beyond what I feel had to be there to get the point across. And the connection that was made between the coven's lust for violence and their sexuality was just too much. So much could have been done with this novel, it certainly had potential and other people may find it complusively readable, but it wallows in depravity, and it is not something I'll be reading again anytime soon."
4,Good book for first try.,"I thought that this was a good effort by a rookie writer. The book, The Fifth Sorceress, was not perfect, but it kept me turning pages, and the author is not afraid to get graphic and nasty with his characters. For those of you who found the book offensive, you should stick to the Harry Potter drivel that is supposedly so popular. Leave the real fantasy novels for adults to read. I am looking forward to reading the second book in the series."
1,Stupendously bad,"I usually try to avoid writing a negative review for anything, since I personally feel that if I have read something awful it is best to forget about it and move on. But I really must let this out and hopefully warn the still-doubtful. This book was bad-- at first laughably bad, in a so-bad-it's-funny sort of way, but by the end, it was just agonizingly, embarassingly bad. Please. I actually wept in frustration the 47th time I read about Wigg's left eyebrow raised ""sardonically,"" and I can't even describe the torment of how often Mr. Newcomb insists on using the word ""indeed."" Indeed, indeed, indeed. I read the whole mess, hoping against hope that the book would become, at the very least, tolerable-- instead I found myself itching to scratch out my own eyes in disgust. Please, everyone, I am not kidding-- save yourself, and avoid this foulness."
2,Overhyped and a little misogynistic,"I got an email from Del Rey a little while ago absolutely slathering over this book, and so I ordered it right away. What a mistake. The book has its good points--it is written fairly well and the ends tie up. But the story is not particularly original, dispite the hype. and can even be downright boring in places. In addition, and worst, there is an undercurrent of ""men are good, women are evil"" that the author may not mean or mean to reveal, but it is there nonetheless.It is a bit insulting to gush as much as the publisher has over this book, comparing it to Terry Goodkind and the like. It's not exciting or original enough for all the hype. It's ok. I suggest the library or waiting for the paperback."
1,Possibly one of the worst books in Fantasy,"This book was so bad, on so many different levels, that I feel insulted as a fan of Fantasy that. It shows how little publishers must think of us if they believed that this would sell. My only consolation is that I bought it for 1.99 at a used book store."
1,One fo the Worst - Unimaginative story telling,"This is one of the worse books I have read. I had all I could do to finish it. Great fantasy should seem real -- this seems like all contrived by an unskilled writer.The heart of the problem is the main character, Tristan, who is weak, spineless and willful. His refusal to obey the Sr. Wizard Wigg is the plot contrivance used by the author to extend the story. Havina a weak central character is simply poor plotting and design.You can foresee every plot incident along the way -- it screams outloud what will happen next. I honestly don't see how any reputable publisher could publish such trash. The only appealing character in the book is Wigg - the rest are boring, uninteresing stereotypes. The fantasy world constructed by the author is as trivial as his writing."
2,Dreadful,"I think several of the other reviews hit it on the head, this is a poorly fleshed out pulp fantasy novel. The characters are transparent, the dialog contrived (someone actually said ""I swear by all that I am and all I will be I will avenge you!""), and the story predictable.The one interesting item that I enjoyed was not the origin of magical power (the blood), but the division of light and dark magic into the Vigors and the Vagaries. However, as with the rest of the book, both styles of magic are barely explained. Skip it."
1,Not sure about any of that but the WRITING was BAD,"I may be ""ingnorant"", too, but the reason I have for panning this book is that the writing is simply sub-standard to put it mildly. It's not like I want every writer to match the prose of the classic writers but at least give me college-level sentence structure and logical progression across the page. To be fair to the author I suppose this book is no better or worse than the other ham-fisted grasps at the junior high school fantasy reading audiences. Recommended for those easily pleased and undistracted by jarring sentence structure or awkward dialogue."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","This was TERRIBLE!This was simply an awful book. The storyline was a bit mediocre with Good/Male and Evil/Women with no gray area at all. Clear cut and simple. The writing was atrocious with repetitions and cliches. Cliches of bumper sticker origin. Here is an example, a quote straight out of the book, ""A bastard quotation from somewhere in his past suddenly came to mind: LEAVE ONLY FOOTPRINTS. TAKE ONLY MEMORIES."" I had to laugh at this. He must have been writing this passage while visiting a national park. It goes on and on with a neverending succession of blandness and bumper sticker cliches. Save money and time and pass this one up."
1,childish,"Newcomb had some good ideas here. Unfortunately, he seems to lack the skill to do anything with them. This is written as if it were intended for 12 year olds. The characters are all caricatures and posture like cartoons. The characters also engage in lengthy and tedious speeches explaining things at the end of every major bit of action and book--because Newcomb cannot figure out how to work facts into narratives and make it a part of the book. There is no skill displayed here at all. It is tedious and silly. The old Fu Manchu character or Doc Savage from the thirties had more layers than this."
5,"Loved it, anyone who says its bad...is wrong","One of the greatest books ever written. In terms of character Newcomb's done it, he has come up with one of the best character lines up ever in a single book. Men = Good Woman = Bad is an entirely new concept that works very well. The actual plot itself is vivid, he leaves no stone unturned and keesp you wanting more. Im no speed reader but this was a page turner, finished the whole thing (what, 700 ish pages?) in around 3 days.. considering I can read a clancy novel in 2 weeks thats amazingly fast. Great book, if you have even the slightest or smallest idea of getting this book, dont let the idiots who wrote bad reviews spoil an amazing adventure, BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,NOT Terry Goodkind,"Inside the dust cover this book is compared to the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. While The Fifth Sorceress IS a book, thats where the comparison ends. The story line is weak. I never felt captured by the characters or the setting. I'll give the second book a chance to change my mind, but I'll get it from the library."
4,Interesting Story,"I just finished this book a few nights ago and I was rather pleased. I have read most of the reviews out there and was actually a little shocked at how strongly opionated some people were. I really do not understand the intense hatred some folks seem to have for this book. Although the writing was not perfect, the story and characters were well executed. I think the dark aspects of the story lend to making it more interesting. I would definitely say that this is fantasy for adults and not for children.If you are thinking of purchasing it, I would give it a try.I have the next book in the story and an looking forward to reading it as soon as I complete Terry Brooks' newest book Jarka Ruus."
1,"300 years ago - OK, I got it","This book represents what happens when an editor fails to edit. Make a game out of it - How many times do we mention how long it has been since ______ (anything here will do, the answer is 300 years) If you do read this book, expect a strong beginning, a weak middle, and no end. Once you are finished, ask yourself - what riddle at the bridge? The hero did not solve a riddle, he just jumped out and tried to kill the guard.I would give two stars, but the publishers keep comparing this to Goodkind and as a fan of his work, this book offends me just enough to remove a star."
2,Too easy to predict what happens,I have no idea why the dustjacket claims this is the next Terry Goodkind! The storyline was simple and shallow. Easy to predict doesn't even begin to describe this book. It is almost as if he is ripping off ideas from other writers (a.k.a. Terry Goodkind). Women dressed in red leather ring a bell? He takes pages to describe what could have been said in a sentence or two or at most a paragraph. If you have nothing better to do than to turn your brain off for a couple of days then read this one. I am hoping that his next one will have a little more substance.
1,I hate when you do that. . . .,"Nice cover, nice premise, but. . .All the hype in the world doesn't change the fact that the story is shallow, the characters flat and undeveloped, and the moral stance ify to say the least. Other than that it's great. To compare this [stuff] to any other readable fantasy would be unkind to them. I did not finish it and would love to have been able to return it. A while back this would have been the ""b"" side to an Ace double. Are we really that hard up for new good fantasy talent??"
1,Disappointing,"I gave this book 258 pages of my reading time, and tried hard to warm to it. I bought it on the strength of the glowing reviews excerpted inside the front cover, so came expecting something good. Unfortunately, the writing is bad (he uses words which don't mean quite what he seems to think they mean), the editing is worse, a really lazy editor, and I got sick and tired of Wigg's ""infamous"" eyebrow! As well, there are inconsistencies that a bit of care should have picked up, the most glaring in the pages I read is the screaming harpy yanking Tristan's dirk from its eye, and then a page later, after it's dead, Wigg pulling the same dirk from the same eye. Yes, it's that basic! I lost patience, and I'm quite a forgiving reader if the story or characters grab me, but neither did, so it's off to the second hand bookstore with ya, Robert!!"
1,Just plain bad,"I have read Jordan, Goodkind, Card, Le Guin, Guy Gavriel Kay, and a host of others. And I like the majority of their books, so you can use that to judge my opinion of this book.The Fifth Sorceress is terrible... do not believe the hype and the ratherly overly dramatic reviews on the cover and that abound on most standard book reviews.Bad plot, word usage, use of point-of-view, character developement, and ""author's magic wand"". The only saving grace of this book is the way the author creates magic in his world... but even that is a rather simple redoing of ""pureblood,"" where magic power is basically determined by the purity of your blood.I can't recomend this book to anyone, instead I would highly suggest reading Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea series.I am still in shock at how people thought this book was any good...."
1,Painfully predictable,"I've never felt compelled to write a review for Amazon.com, but with this book I felt I must. I started the book looking forward to what the author might have to say and less than 1/4 through the book I found myself predicting perfectly what would happen on the next page. I tried repeatedly to stop reading the book, but I had convinced myself that there must be more to the author and to the book than predictable plot twists. Unfortunately I was dead wrong. If you're 20+ years old, you've probably seen enough movies or read enough books to predict everything that would happen in this book. Do yourself a favor - spend the money on something else, like a good movie rental or a better book."
1,How did this ever get published?,"I have read about one-third of this book, and I doubt that I will finish it. This tops ""The Eye of Argon"" for being laughably bad. Do I have to give it one star?It was totally incompetent, unoriginal, unbelievable, and just plain embarrassing. Even for a politically-incorrect reader, the gender stereotypes were annoying and preposterous. Lots of unnecessary violence, grossness, and badly-described meaningless sex. About the best thing I can say for this book is that most of the words were spelled correctly.Fortunately, I didn't *buy* this book. The only reason I have it is that (at one time) it was available for free, as a sample download for the PalmReader. But it's not even worth downloading for free. Save your money, and save your time. (Go buy something by Robin Hobb or Steven Brust.)"
2,Not good....,"I did not like this book for many reasons, as other reviewers have stated. For me the worst part was the rather graphic and brutal violence and the silly depiction of those nasty, nasty sorceresses.... I almost stopped reading several times, but felt duty-bound to finish it. (For that reason I gave it a second star....)There may be a good story trying to get out here, but it is drowned in the writer's rather gruesome depictions and characterizations. I think I will pass on the rest of this series...."
1,The reviews are bad for a reason,"Just these two lines should provide all the proof you need.Wigg went on. ""This passageway is the last defense before entering Shadowood proper, and if anyone of unendowed blood or without the benefit of time enchantments enters this tunnel, they are recognized by the incantations we left behind, and immediately killed. Only gnomes are exempt.""""By the way,"" the old wizard(Wigg)asked of the gnome. ""How is it that you can traverse this tunnel without being of endowed blood?""I think those that gave the book 2 or more stars were being overgenerous. Those that gave it 4 or 5 stars would seem to be crackheads. I found this crud in a bargain bin, after having read 1/3rd of it, I knew why. This is a truly atrocious piece of crap."
1,better alternatives,"Odd little add-on to the Aquadoodle products. Weirdest thing is that it unscrews to the right and tightens to the left. That is backward in most countries, isn't it? Most maddening thing was that it cost half as much as a full mat and pen set, and did not qualify for free shipping from Amazon Prime. Definitely not worth my money. I preferred the extra pen plus paintbrush set I ordered."
3,mother of 4 year old girl,"bought this for my daughter to go with her mat, she liked it. nothing really special to tell, it's the same ones that come with the mat, i just wanted extra."
5,luv2cook,Absolutely the best recipes I've seen in a long time. Bought both books and have tried many recipes - each one is a winner. Would highly recommend these even if you don't want to freeze your meals. (and the ingredients are common ones found right in your pantry!)
4,Nicely written...,This book was nicely written and organized. I think I was just looking for a different variety of recipes. I loved the hints to each section and recipes.
4,Great dinner ideas,"I loved the title of this book. I'm a school teacher, so I have a hard time fixing dinner after school. I made several of their ideas this summer, and it has really helped this fall. They had some great ideas, on all different kinds of foods, not just casseroles, but soups, appetizers, desserts. I think it's great!!"
3,Too much FAT and calories!,"I know that everyone says the recipes turned out great and I haven't made any yet. Indeed, I will probably make some of these recipes. However, most of the ones that sounded good to me (read that as recipes my family will eat) were very high in calories and fat. I'll cut the fat out, but I wish that the authors would lighten up some of their entrees. I like the 30 day gourmet book better and the nutrional information is terrific and they have a web site with more recipes. The web site is free for anyone that buys the book."
3,So So,"I have to admmit I was a little disappointed in the book. Many of the side dish recipes aren't even recommended for freezing ahead, which defeats the purpose of the book. Also, there were no thawing guidelines. Everything from raw chicken in marinades to lasagnas, casseroles, etc, had directions that stated simply ""Thaw completely"". I worry particularly about cooking meat that is not completely thawed, and some sort of guideline for thawing would have been helpful. I also didn't think there was a great variety, particularly with chicken which is what we eat most. Many, though not all, of the chicken recipes were simply raw breasts thrown in several different types of sauces / marinades, which you can buy like that already marinated at the store. It was however simple, the instructions were clear, and I liked the measurements being multiplied out for you if you're making several meals. It is better than the one from 30 day gourmet, but not as good as the Frozen Assets one."
2,NOT worth it! Very disappointed. :(,"I read the rave reviews so I was very excited to start cooking! I just went through BOTH books and am VERY disappointed in the AMOUNT of items needed AND the multiple steps--1 recipe for topping, 1 for filling, 1 for sauce, etc... Also, 50% of these recipes requre some sort of unusual item (imported Bovarian Cheese isn't just laying around in the fridge in my house). I think i will do better assembling my own list from online recipes that don't require me to cook the meat for 4 hours or cook or brown the meat/chicken ahead of time. I have no idea how these taste since I don't plan on using the recipes so that's the only reason I gave this (these) books 2 stars. Unless you have LOTS of time and many out-of-the ordinary food items, I would skip this book and look online at places like [...] for recipes you can simply assemble and freeze without cooking 8 items first."
2,"Okay, but not worth the time",Only made a few dinners from this book. Way too much time and effort goes into preparing before freezing. Not what I had in mind. Dream Dinners is still much more time sensitive and more cost savings for me...
4,No fish or seafood recipes,"I just purchased this book and it does appear to have a lot of good recipes in it. But I just can't give it 5 stars because there is not one recipe in it that includes fish or seafood. I assemble at Dream Dinners and Supper Suppers often and I wanted to start making things at home to save money. I can't believe with how healthy fish is and important in ones diet, that this book does not include any fish recipes. Pretty disappointed."
2,Not an inspiring cookbook,"As a long-time fan of Dream Dinners, I wanted to find a cookbook to help me create dinners that I could prepare and freeze. What I liked about the book was that each recipe, as made, makes a bunch -- usually 6 to 8 servings -- we're a family of 3, so I would have extra to freeze for later. But it gets better. Each recipe includes a set of columns where the authors have calculated the amount of each ingredient you'll need if you want to double, triple or quadruple the recipe.What I didn't like was the ""blah-ness"" of the recipes. When the book arrived, I eagerly read it cover to cover, ready to select all of our yummy make-ahead meals. I only found one that I wanted to try, and my family found it mushy and tasteless.I ended up returning the book and hope to have better luck with the two other ""Once a Month Cooking"" books I selected."
4,Bought by accident ;(,I bought this book by accident as I was trying to get in and see it. I thought you would be able to review your order but obviously not so be careful when looking at downloadable purchases.
2,Not quite what I expected,"This book is kind of misleading, in my mind when you are saying dinners in the freezer. That means it's a simple pop it in the microwave and heat it up. This book shows you how to freeze your food, then thaw your food, and then cook it. So it's not a simple pop it in the microwave and tada food's ready."
3,Where's the time savings?,Perhaps my expectations were too high. The recipes look good and they will probably be ones that my family will like. But why do I hesitate to spend a weekend making and preparing meals to freeze? Because most of them are covered with sauce and require defrosting. When I saw the title of this book I thought it would be a big timesaver--going from freezer to the oven. But my thinking is: if I have to plan time for defrosting...I might as well make it the same day and eat it right away. Why waste another day preparing (not to mention extra time bagging and/or finding containers for food)when it will only take as much time (or more) to defrost it as it did to prepare it???
4,Good recipes,"I think this book is great. After reading all the reviews about freezer meals that is what made me purchase this one. Easy meals and good too. My family REALLY like the ones I have made so far. I don't think you can really save money doing this but it sure saves on time and the hassel of ""Whats for dinner?"". I now have a friend wanting to borrow my book and see what she thinks of it before she buys it. I highly recommend this book."
3,Just OK...,"Some nice ideas, but how come nobody can seem to come up with a book on tasty low refined carb/low fat freezer meals that have nutritional information on them?"
3,Interesting recipes but no photos of recipes,I was a bit sad that there are no pictures of recipes contained in the cookbook. I find it hard to get excited about a recipe when you don't see what the finished dish looks like. The only picture was on the cover!
3,Nutritional analysis missing,"In this time of increasing health-consciousness, I prefer cookbooks that include nutritional analysis charts with each recipe. When I searched inside, it appeared that this book lacks this information. This might not be a negative for some, but it is for me."
2,Rehashed and Below Expectations with too much branding,"I had moderate hopes for this guide and cookbook. However, the recipes are fairly blah. The freezing instructions make sense, but are largely just gloss and can be found on the internet for free. Also, there are very few recipes in the book. I'm not saying that the book is bad or poorly written: it's simply not good. My final complaint: Don't Panic.. has too much brand name dropping and product placement. We've already paid for the book; quit shoving brands in our faces."
5,Great Freezable Recipes,I purchased this book while expecting my first child to prepare meals for when he arrived and I would have little time for cooking. So far I have made a few recipes - some are easy and some are a bit labor intensive! Directions are very easy to follow and the freezing/thawing process is explained very well.
5,great product,item as promised. great book. it has tons of great (practical) ideas that can be easily incorporated into normal cooking.
5,Great ideas!,This book is going to be very helpful for folks trying to plan ahead and de stress dinner time. I'm planning to start my first cook day this monday.
4,Great Book,"Love this book, the recipes are good. I cook for a month with a friend and for other families so we use alot of recipes. We have several other of this type of book and I'd say we use more recipes out of this book than any other. The only thing that I would like to see in this book is pictures. But I have to say that out of the four books we use only two have pictures: one of those (Freezer Friendly Meals)only has pictures for about half the recipes and the other (Super Suppers) is falling apart, the binding is really cheap."
2,A bit disappointing,"Not quite what I had expected. A lot of these recipes are simply different marinades for meat, which I've done in the past simply by buying pre-made marinades at the store. Don't be fooled by the title, these aren't simply remove from the freezer and bake meals. They are prep meals for the freezer, with additional ingredients and time added to the serving day requirements. No pictures at all, which was a disappointment. I was also a little confused by the amount of fresh pasta recipes (not frozen). Why they were included in a freezer cookbook is beyond me. I was looking for something to prepare meals for others, just to pop in the oven or heat up, and this wasn't it. I'll keep looking..."
2,didn't work,"This book just didn't work for my family at all. Most recipes call for ingredients that are processed. Then, the prep work is way to long. Made the chicken enchiladas, and they were totally bland, and took way to long to make the double batch.Not worth the effort at all! Most of the recipes are extremely heavy in the meat department, so they aren't much of a savings in terms of recipes. All in all, just didn't work well for my family at all. I gave the book to my friend and she raves about it and uses it all the time, and has a freezer full of things like muffins and soups. Something for everyone I guess."
3,Not what I was looking for.,"This book is geared toward saving money by buying large quantities of chicken breasts or beef, and packaging them with seasonings to use in recipes later. Most recipes begin with the instruction ""thaw completely"". I was looking for Freezer-to-Oven meals for busy days."
2,Miffed by marinade,"I was miffed by a recipe in this book that called for me to marinate london broil on the counter for 2 hours, then freeze for later consumption. I followed the recipe, but after 1 1/2 hours the meat felt warm to the touch and I began to wonder if this was a good idea. Checked meat safety tips online and every one stated: ""If your recipe calls for marinating on the counter...don't do it"". I expect I will now throw away almost 4 lbs. of london broil as I fear bacteria growth while it was marinating on my counter. This was a big disappointment for me and a waste of money. Other recipes seem interesting, don't know if I'll try them yet."
4,Dinner next week,"Has a lot of good recipes in it. I prefer this much more than I do the Dream Dinners book. There is a great variety of recipes and some that I never would have though of. The recipes are made up so that you can have one for dinner tonight and make enough for two, three, or six more nights. Having the dinner in the freezer really helps when you have those kind of days. Would definately recommend this book over the Dream Dinners one."
4,Great LearnIng Book,"As a mom with a full time job and 2 boys immersed in sports I barely have time for anything!!! I read an article about a mom who cooks 2 weeks worth of meals in ONE day! Her ideas stemmed from this book and I had to have it. It really lays it all out for you and helped answer all my freezing questions! Now I'm a one day cooking mom! The only down part was the recipes included. These are not meals my family would eat, save a few. The book delivered right on time and in perfect condition!"
4,Great for dinner when you're tired!,"I've spent anywhere from 2-5 hours cooking a week to two weeks worth of meals from this book. Great recipes. Many are kid friendly and easy to put together. I've enjoyed the ""one day"" of cooking for two weeks worth of meals. It saves money, saves time and what's great is since you're doing so many meals, you can get the kids involved at least a little bit and teach them while you're cooking. Would definitely recommend! :)"
5,Great book!,"This is an excellent cookbook - lots of great recipes. We haven't had a chance to do the bulk cooking yet, but LOVE several of the recipes. Looking forward to getting the bulk cooking done. We've done it before and it is a huge time saver. Just what we need to eliminate our excuses to run out to eat."
1,Poor Selection,"First off, if you like sweet/savory dishes, then you'll likely enjoy these recipes. But if you don't, then the selection in this book is extremely limited. In addition, there are no side dishes that are freeze-able. They all say ""this dish is best served on the day it is prepared"" and offer no freezer/thawing instructions. There are way too many drink, bread and dessert recipes, leaving little room for variety in the main dish section. The few main dishes from the book that I have assembled are decent; however, they are too complex."
4,product review,"On first read, this book leaves me with a question....why go to all of the trouble to create my own marinades/sauces etc if time is of the essence? Seriously, if I'm so booked for time, am I really going to be making my own egg noodles?The concept is awesome...if I want to cook a lot and fill the feezer w/ extra meals - this cookbook is spot on! But, if I'm coming home late from tball (etc- enter your own afterwork commitment) and I have to defrost something before I re-cook it? hmmm.....In this respect, I would have loved more of the ""take it frozen from the freezer and put it in the oven for 30 minutes"" type recipes...And, I am sure a lot of these recipes could tolerate that...but I'm new to this ""feed the feezer"" movement, so I dont' know alot about this.The cookbook is well written w/ excellent instructions/notes etc.And, the recipes seem to have variety.I just thought the intro to the book was a tad misleading.cheers."
5,"My First ""Freezer"" cookbook: LOVE IT!",I have saved SO much money using this book. I used to spend about $400 on groceries a month. Now I spend $200! WOW! Thats big savings. This book teaches you how to look for and buy meats that are on overstock prices and make them into great meals. I save so much time and now I have a variety of things to choose from for dinner. And it only takes about 20 minutes to warm it up and it tast so fresh still! I love it because I'm just starting out and learning to really cook good home style meals. This takes out all the guess work! It's easy to follow and the meals are yummy! There is something for everyone in this book!
2,not the same as the great book,"the movie was ok, in it's own right. however compared to the book-it's not the same! the only thing that's the same about it is that there were 4 kids who were abandoned by their mother and played in an attic and were mean to by their ""Grandmother."" not even some of the names, nor descripiton were the same."
2,Average to the extreme,"Perhaps if this movie was a mini series,it could have worked. I would hold nothing agains the director or script writer, because I think anyone who has read the book will agree with me on my next point:The novel was too much to cram into just a few hours.It caught the minor details that the novel portrayed of four children locked away in an attic for years, but on the other hand skipped major milestones in the story. For this reason, the characters lacked depth that the novel allowed to be seen, the relationships were not as believable and the plot seemed just far fetched. But if you have nothing better to do, go for it."
3,The book was beautiful but the movie wasn't quite there.,"Terrible acting on a young Kristy Swansons part as well as the other locked up children. Victoria Tennant was good as the mother though. This movie could have been so much more..but for V.C. Andrews fans, this is one to own..you can even see her playing the role of a maid."
3,"Its was ok, the book was better.",I've read the whole Flowers in the Attic series (along with all the other books she wrote). But the movie leaves out to many things and it makes up an ending! If you like the movie read the books.
3,An okay movie that made me go and read a great book.,"At first I thought this movie was very good, but after I read the book I found out the movie was very poorly done. I did like the casting though, and thought they couldv've done alot more."
2,not a good adaptation,"I have read the book Flowers in the Attic and the movie adaptation,though a good story, is not what the author originally wrote. Many parts were cut out and the story didn't have the same compellingness"
2,Dissapointing however intriguing,"This film adaptation of the fabulous gothic novel ""Flowers in the Attic"" did the book little justice. Had someone just seen the movie without reading the book they would have probably enjoyed it a lot. But for those of us that read the book, the movie was quite tame. While capturing the gothic theme of the book and some great performances on the part of Swanson and Fletcher, the movie seemed to be more interested in maintaining a pg-13 rating than to be true to the book and risk the R. Where is the incestuol relationship between Cathy and Chris? And if the film is narrarated by Cathy, how is she supposed to see her mother being whipped when she is locked in the attic? Wes Craven's script for this movie would have easily been better and the filmaker's made a mistake in using such a weak script for a potentially fabulous movie."
5,A Great Cult Classic,"Okay, so this movie didn't win an Oscar but it has been a staple in my film repertoire for many years (along with Mommie Dearest). Perhaps ""disturbingly campy"" would be a fitting description. No movie based on a book can cram all the material in one, two, or three hours. Isn't that why we have movies, a book squeezed onto a screen with only the ""good"" parts?It seems the overall consensus is that this was a bad movie, but it was, and is, good, for those of us who find the meaning, the dark humor, and the camp. Christopher Young, who is a brilliant composer, arranged the soundtrack. The music is beautiful regardless of what is thought of the movie."
2,"EH... AS FAR AS HORROR MOVIES GO, NO BIG DEAL...",... there's a strong made-for-TV vibe about this movie... 'nuff said.
4,If you're familiar with her work...,"If you're a VC Andrews fan, be aware that this movie will not have the amount of enchantment that the books had. This movie was made from a series of five books and can not possibly capture all the events in just 90 minutes.The events had to be rushed in order to get to the main plot of the children in the attic and what they went through. In my opinion, things went at the right speed to convey the importance of each thing happening. If you've read the series, be prepared to see that this is will not live up to that. Try to have an open mind. For me, the different ending was sort of cool. It was different and added excitement. It was something new and interesting for a book I had alreaady read. I'm glad they did that. I would just have liked to see a more modern portrayal with better quality. All in all, a new adventure for loyal fans."
5,I like it,Great movie and good shipping time and i watch this movie its sad and its funny so if u looking for a suspense movie this is it
3,Not the book!!!,"The movie alone was good, if you are going to see it don't expect it to be like the book by V C Andrews. The movie changes things from the book and will leave you disappointed if you try to compare it, but if you take it by itself it is a good movie. The cast is good, the music is creepy but it is scary/suspence movie. You will enjoy it if you see it."
4,Flowers In The Attic,Great acting and plot for the movie..but shouldn't have been made into a PG-13 type of rating. Would've been much better or right with the book version if it was made into either an R-rated or NC-17 rating with the incest chapter from the book.
1,Very dissapointing!!!,"I am a sixteen years old and completely adore V.C. Andrews.I have read almost all of her books and Flowers in the Attic is my favorite book of all. I bought this dvd thinking that it would actuallu go with the book but was very angry when they practically changed the whole story! Where is the scene where Chris and Cathy go to the lake, or the love scene between them?I am sooo sorry I bought and saw this movie, not one bit how I pictured it in my mind. I am currently reading Flowers in the Attic along with the entire series for the third time, and if you haven't read the book at least once, you don't know what you're missing out on. I recommend the book a 100%, but not this movie, which in my opinion has nothing to do with the book!Please read the book if you haven't done so already, and do not see this movie which shouln't even go by the title Flowers in the Attic, by V.C. Andrews."
2,Didn't Live Up To Expectations!,"A warning: If you're suffering from bouts of depression, don't watch this movie; it will only exacerbate your condition! I just happened to watch this film on a cable channel late one night. This flick was presented to the big screen, but may have been better suited as a made-for-television film. It doesn't take a very perspicacious person to see the sets and no-name cast of this film are the products of a very frugal budget. However, the acting produced by the precocious children and the better than average musical score add a little quality to a film which presents a rather shallow screen depiction of the novel. It's just another picture that illustrates the deleterious power of mankind's most deadly sin, greed. I won't spoil it for you by telling you how it ends, but I can say this much; I doubt if anyone will have any remorse for the mother after what transpires in the film."
3,movie vs book,I'll be honest that I haven't read the book. I was maybe 13 when the movie came out. Up until recently when I read the reviews from the book vs the movie I understand more clearly. THe movie just makes it sound like the father didn't approve of the husband. Of course it has been some time since I last saw the movie. The biggest complaint I have heard is they cut out the love scenes between Chris and Cathy. They probably did that to cover there butts. It's one thing to put stuff like that in books but the kind of criticisms they would have received had that been in the movie could have been bad.
5,A movie that will make you think,"This movie was really great although I liked the book better. Makes you wonder how a mother could do something so cruel to her children for money. Louise Fletcher is great as the grandmother, a really creepy woman. And Kristy Swanson is wonderful as Cathy, a strong willed teenager. I like the ending to the movie better than the book. You could say the mother gets what is coming to her, a well deserved end."
1,What a way to ruin a book,"I bought this movie thinking that is was Flowers in the Attic By V.C. andrews, and to an extent it is. The names are the same and the general plot is the same, but the main points that make this first book great are HORRIBLY altered. There are scenes that were in the future book and the killing of the mother at her wedding and not by an act of fire was one of the few ""out in left field"" parts of this movie where i practically SCREAMED wanting to pull out my hair and the horrible crime that had been committed! This movie annoyed me greatly because it was barely true to the book. I loved the book, I HATED THE MOVIE! I have told EVERYONE that if you've read the book dont see the movie."
3,???????????????????????????????????????????,bohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh la more yfhd goui dunkya whell xjjle regard so dpour la casscettes ahgjk!
1,0 STARS: The Grandmother doesn't concern me.,"Well, what great, powerful and formidable villains we have in this movie...the Grandmother really makes Leatherface look like a wimp. Frankly, the Grandmother scares me about as much bowl of pudding. If I were in this movie, the movie would last three seconds because I would kick the Grandmother's, the mother's and John's ass in two seconds...that would be hit. Give me a break, horror movie???? Spare me, this is not a horror movie...this a joke!!"
2,Not to the book,"This movie did no justice to the book. Anyone who read the book and followed the series should be appauled by the change in the ending and the details that were iggnored in the movie. The movie seemed to be rushed and did not go in depth into the relationships between the characters. In the novel, one of the main points of focus was the taboo love which had developed between Chris and Cathy. There should be a re-make of this movie that should tell the story how the novel tells the story. The movie should not share the name ""Flowers in the Attic"" with the book."
2,The Flowers Have Wiltered!,"First off, I had to laugh at one of the earlier reviews that said this was based on a true story. Uh, no it's not, although I SUPPOSE it's possible that somewhere in the world, there were four children forced to live in an attic so their mother could inherit millions. Anyway, this movie is poorly edited, badly written, and unimaginatively directed, with only a few flashes of inspired acting. However, having said that, the movie is also very engrossing and involving, and like a bad accident, you can't take your eyes off of it once you start watching. It's clear from the choppy editing and short running time that scenes were removed, such as the incestuous love affair between the two oldest siblings and scenes involving the mother and her fiancee. How unfortunate that the DVD doesn't feature those deleted scenes... perhaps the movie would have been better if they hadn'd been deleted."
3,The music is the best part.,"The very best part of this movie was the music -- I have searched all over for the soundtrack, but to no avail. It was poignant and haunting and eerie all at once.Also, all the actors were very well cast. The kids and the grandmother were great!My major problem with this movie was its ending, which was nothing at all like the book's. Things were thrown in which never happened in the book, and the sequence of events in the beginning of the movie (portrayal of a happy home life, father's death, exodus to Grandmother's house) was very rushed.I liked the mansion; it was very much what I pictured Foxworth Hall looking like."
4,A chilling movie,Flowers in the Attic was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has 4 children locked away in an attic like a deadly secret. It gave me chills just thinking that child abuse is real in the world. This movie may have seemed farfetched to others but with me it was related to reality. I give it four stars.
2,Worst addaption of a book ever!,"I've read the book at least 5 times that I can recall, and when I first saw the movie my thought was ""cult hit, but, mainstream hit never."" Almost nothing like V. C. Andrews wonderful book, leaving out almost everything including the ending. The only reason I even give it 2 stars is because the musical score is hauntingly beautiful."
1,Definitley not the best movie adapted froma book,"As soon as I finished the book by VC Andrews, i rushed out to buy the film. To my misfortune, it was one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. It was nowhere near as captivating as the novel, and nearly every part of the book worth reading was cut from the movie. I must say, they could have done a much better job."
2,it's been said before but...,"The movie was o.k. but like the other reviewers have noted, it could have been soooo much better! What disappoints me most is that this movie could have had some wonderful sequals. With the movie ending the way it did it left no room for the continuation of the story...really too bad."
1,Very Poor Quaility Reproduction,"Too Dark, No subtiles, extremly poor audio, could not view entire movie. Would not recomend this seller for any purchase of DVD'S"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE NOVEL,"Like most people who read the novel, I was not deeply impressed with the movie, ""Flowers in the Attic."" It could have been so much better. The scenery and setting for the house was fantastic and was very much close to the way it was described as in the book. Some setbacks were that there was some bad acting in it and too much drama in the dialogue. Many things were changed and cut out, so the story line wasn't clsoe to the book at all, especially the ending when the mother dies. The grandmother in the movie did not look the way she was described in the book and the guy who played Chris was not very cute. Overall, if you've never read the book, the movie may seem much better to you. I first watched this when I was about 4 or 5 and it scared me. Then as I grew older, I liked it more, but once I read the book, it couldn't compare. Hopefully, one day, they willl make a newer version of ""Flowers in the Attic"" much closer to the book with good actors."
2,This movie doesn't do justice to the book!,"""Flowers in the Attic"" is my favorite book and could make a fantastic movie -- if they'd spend more than two minutes on it. After watching the movie, all I could think of was how disappointed I was that they changed most of the key elements of the story and about all that they left out. I think that they should re-make the movie, this time including the sequels. Sure, it would be about eight hours. But that's what it would take to do justice to this remarkable author and book series. And this movie just doesn't do that."
3,a very good film indeed but does no justice to the book,I've read somewhere that they were considering in filming a movie based on several of V.C.Andrews books. Does anyone out there know anything about it?
3,disappointed...,After reding the book I went out to rent the movie and I must say that I was truely disappointed. The movie didn't capture the essence of the novel. The book was captivating and so detailed that you could get a clear mental image. The movie only skimmed the top surface. In my opinion the movie left out the most interesting parts. The movie would have been much better if all the major parts were included. Even if the movie was a little longer it would be well worth it.
3,Read the book!!,"After reading the book and then hearing that it was made into a movie, I ran out immediately to the video store and rented it. Boy, was I disappointed!! It was good and all, and I understand that for it to really capture the essence of the novel it would probably have to be about 4 hours long, but they barely scratched the surface of the plot! They didn't do a good job expressing how each of the characters was feeling as was done wonderfully in the novel. So my recommendation, read the book, and then all the others in the Dollanganger series. You'll be as entrawed as I was!!"
3,could have been better!,"I have seen this movie and I can't say that I was thrilled. Indeed the book was 10 times better then the movie. The movie was a shortened version and to my mind the best parts were left out. It's an ok movie, so if you don't have anything better to do, have a look at it!"
1,"Oh, so verrry, very bad.","I should first confess that I am not the greatest fan of the novel from which this film was (allegedly) made.All I can really ask is, ""What is this about?"" It sure doesn't seem to have drawn much from V.C. Andrews writing. The acting is like community theater gone very, very wrong.If you loved the novel, this book is an injustice! If you didn't like the novel, this film is just adding insult to injury. If you are a fan of bad movies so bad that they're hilarious, you'll find no laughs here.Blech."
4,Surpised to Find it,I was surprised to find the movie. So yes I was glad to be able to order it..Very Happy.To show my Grandchilren what a bad grandma is.Flowers in the Attic
3,Not Louise Fletcher's best,"The book was fabulous...the movie was not!However, I still like the movie because I love Louise Fletcher.Unfortunately she was ONE of the reasons I didn't like it. I just expected so much more from her.The rest of the acting was borderline camp.With all of that said...I still bought the film and I'm sure I'll watch it again."
3,Flowers or Foe?,"If you saw this movie when it first came out, then you know that it has since been edited, removing key components to the storyline.I have never read the book, but saw the movie many years ago. The new release has removed the incest from the movie, thus changing the way a viewer SHOULD feel about the way it ends. Many new releases of 70's and 80's movies are being edited this way.This was an excellent movie, and still a good one in my mind, but not what it should be."
3,another book to film horror/drama film i liked,"what a wicked grandmother and evil mother , i used to watch this all time back in the 80's when it would come on cinemax almost every other day so i'm glad the its on dvd now , i hated the fact that one of the kids had to die but thank god the ones that didn't get there revenge at the end against there evil mother and grandmother that was classic.... i just hope they don't make a sequel having cathy return back to her grandmother's house and go through all that crap again ...."
4,effective gothic style horror(just my opinion),"i thought this is a really creepy movie and very hard to watch.it is filled with an air of dread and depression,but i managed to get through it.the last time i tried to watch it,i had to stop watching after 15 minutes.Louise Fletcher is terrifying as the wicked and evil grandmother.i thought the movie was very effective in the horror dept.it doesn't go into as much depth as the book,but i think that would require at least a 2 part mini series.i wouldn't recommend it if you are feeling down.also,if you are a fan of the book,keep in mind that they left alot out of the movie.other than that,i would recommend it,especially if you like gothic style horror,which is what i think this movie is.for me,""Flowers in the attic gets a 3.5/5"
1,Poorly done,"I saw this movie a long time ago and actually liked it. The movie made me want to read the book. Needless to say, once I read the book I realized the movie was a horrible adaptation of the book. The only plus in the movie is the grandmother which was played wonderfully. I really hope someone will consider trying to redo this and make a movie which is based on all 5 of her books."
3,3 stars for the movie alone,"I think all the people complaining here about the movie being not as good as the book should ask themselves this question. if you had never read the book and watched the movie what would you think of it then? i have read the book many times and enjoyed it. the movie i thought was well done. good acting by victoria tennant, louise fletcher and kristy swanson. and a beautiful score by christopher young. an obvious stunt double at the end was laughable but thats it. the movie by itself was decent, quit trashing it people give it a rest."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"I had read the book, which was really good, a long time ago. So when me and my friend went to go rent a vido, I suggested Flowers in the Attic. It was such a gross travisty, and the actors couldnt even act! My friend never lets me pick out movies anymore because my judgement is no longer trusted. V. C. Andrews would be turning in her grave!"
1,Flowers in the attic,"I have all of V.C. Andrews books and my favorite on is Flowers in the Attic. I made a mistake though. I watched the movie then read the book. If you want to get this movie, read the book first. If you read the book first then watch the movie, you will spot all the parts they did'nt add. In my opinion, the book deserves 100 stars and some."
3,So Bad It's Almost Good,"This film is destined to be a cult favorite as it is so laughably bad, it's actually fun to watch. Kristy Swanson is at her absolute worst, not only in that atrocious wig, but unable to deliver any of her lines without yelling them. Too bad her character survives! Victoria Tennant isn't much better as the money-hungry mamma. Oscars should have gone to Louise Fletcher as the evil grandmother who is so over the top I was rolling on the floor laughing. As for the two little ones, they are so obnoxious it's a shame the cyanide didn't work any faster!"
3,It could have been better.,The movie seemed to me a mash of both book one and parts of two. I think it would have been way better if they had the charaters you know. If you never read the book you would say so what's the big deal between brother and sister. The movie made it all to innocent. It would have been better if they made it a rated R movie.
4,Terrible Acting But Still Worth It,"This is one screwed up fil that is chilling, eerie, and disturbing. It is a guilty pleasure that most people will either hate or love. Kristy Swanson gives a terrible terrible performance as the oldest daughter, and Jeb Stuart Adams is even worse as the brother. The marvelous Louise Fletcher is over the top and chilling as the grandmother and she seems more upset with herslef by taking this role than with the children. But even with all it's acting flaws this is one of the creepiest films ever made. The incestous relationship between the older siblings should have been played out more but it would have been too disturbing to watch on screen. I do recommend this film for the weiedness and creepiness of the plot, certailny not for the acting ablities. Could go down as some of the worst performances ever."
3,creepy movie,"I really did not want to see this movie the first time that I saw it. I reluctantly sat with my cousins, my sis, my bro, and a friend to watch it. During the film, I got really enthralled into the storyline. It was really sad when little Cory died.Anyway, a few years later, I read the book. The movie did not stay true to the book. It ended very differently."
2,Very Disappointing!!!,"I read the book and loved it. Couldn't wait for the movie to come out. At that time I usually didn't go to the movies. I would wait for it on video. I couldn't wait for this one. Was there on opening night and boy, was I disappointed. It barely touched what the book had. It didn't have the depth and sadness that is brought out in the book. Maybe if I didn't read the book, I could of enjoyed the movie. But I did read it and I was disappointed!"
3,Disappointing...but still held interest!,"I am an avid fan of all of VC Andrews' novels. Flowers in the Attic was definitely the most captivating and suspensful. Unfortunately, this movie only skimmed the plots and themes in the novel. The character development was very shallow for such a rich novel!"
1,This DVD is TRASH!!!,"This DVD is trash! The picture is very bad is had tons of grain and it looks like the DVD was taken from an old VHS. The audio is crappy too just like VHS audio. There are no extra featurs just a sceene selection. And the DVD cover is bad as well. It looks like the book cover and the cover insert is too small for the case. Dont buy this DVD buy the other one. ""Top Ten Media Production Limited"" is the company who put out this crap DVD... STAY AWAY!!!"
1,Flowers in the Attic(the movie-I have not nor will I read the book.),"I saw the movie recently and instantly on Netflixinstant and the movie is such a dragger.It drags on and frankly it is very depressing(Yes that is the intention.)but My main problem with it is how boring the film is and predictable,it runs more like a soap opera or made for tv movie or something on oxygen or lifetime."
1,So sorry I saw this...,"I'm okay with Hollywood taking out the incest. I'm really ok with that. A really good writer can write a decent FITA movie without that element and still make it ... well decent. But the bad writing, the bad acting, and that horrible cheesy music just ruin the movie. I'm so sorry I saw this."
2,Send a telegram!,"I don't get the rave reviews... key elements of the plot are ""telegraphed"" instead of dramatized and the script is WAY too timid dealing with the incest theme which is absolutely crucial to the story - to the point that if you haven't read the book you wouldn't know there was any incest there at all. The acting is just passable and much as I love her, Louise Fletcher as grandma is a cartoon villain. The whole story seems under-cooked, but the main idea is spooky I guess? Okay if you don't expect too much (but couldn't you say that about most any movie?)"
2,Flowers In the Attic,"In this story, the ideal mother, Victoria Tennant takes her four children to live with her dying father in a big creepy old mansion. The kids all get confined in the attic while she attempts to get past their horrible grandma and win her way back to the old man's heart and fortune. ""Flowers in the Attic"" is sort of a slow and senseless film that lacks motivation, and flawed by embarrassingly flat acting and directing in my opinion. I would recommend you ""skip it""......."
3,Flowers in the Attic,"I'm not going to compare this movie to the book, so I'm just going to review the movie itself. It's good, nothing incredibly grand, but a very solid effort. It runs smoothly, although the ending does have an expedited feel in my opinion, like they had to pare it down to meet time constraints. Everyone knows this story revolves around incest and really sadism as well, which are more alluded to than actually explored. The kids tend to overact quite severely in this movie, but the adults put on great performances. Suspenseful at times, but definitely has a couple of spotty moments. Still, a better than average movie."
3,Movie Different From the Book,"I have read the original book and watched the movie. The two are different. The book has more juicy things then the latter. The problem with the movie is the ending. The book ending is totally different because if it was the same as the movie there wouldn't be any sequels to it. The actors in the movie help make what the characters look visual is great, but that is about it. The movie is great to do on a raining day, but if your into delicious details the book gives it to you and then some."
3,Could Have Been Better...,First and Foremost: READ THE BOOK!The movie is good...but not GREAT! The Casting was brilliant all around. The Script Story left out Major Plot-lines from the book...like the fact that Cathy and Chris end up falling in love with each other!I own this on DVD and enjoy watching it even though the Script is Weak...there's just something extra creepy about living in an attic. Creepy and kind of cool at the same time. It's like living on a deserted Island...I guess.This is the ULTIMATE in FAMILY DISFUNCTION!!!!Go ahead and See It...
3,DVD quality,My first DVD copy of this movie was flawed. Near the end the picture would freeze. I sent it back and got another copy and it does the same thing. I tried both copies on several DVD players and it did the same thing. So I am thinking that maybe all of the copies of this movie are flawed. It starts freezing about 8 minutes before the end of the movie. So if you get the DVD version be sure to check it out as soon as you get it to make sure you got a good copy. I did not do this so I can not return my 2nd flawed copy.
2,READ THE BOOK!,"If you went to the theater and saw this movie without having read the book, it is a pretty good story line, and fairly well cast.... on the other hand, if you read the book first, WOW what a disappointment it was for me to waste my money and my time on the film. I realize that book versions of anything, are usually better, but when you change a great deal of the story time-line, you have just invented something new, and should then re-name it."
4,good buy,MY SON LOVES THIS TRUCK. I PURCHASED THIS TOY FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE PLAYS WITH IT ALL THE TIME. I WOULD RECOMEND THAT ANY ONE THAT BUYS THIS TRUCK ALSO PURCHASE AN EXTRA BATTERY OR TWO FOR LONGER PLAY TIME.
5,The Work of Nature is a great work of literature,"One of the greatest deficits in knowledge that most Americans carry has to do with biodiversity. Yvonne Baskin does a great job of pulling together a wide variety of ecological research results to reduce that deficit. Her writing is strong and clear (although it is an exaggeration to compare it to a Stephen King thriller, as is done on the back cover of the book). The Work of Nature is worth reading cover to cover, and then keeping as a useful reference book. Take the message to heart, and spread it widely: it is vital that we do more to save the natural world from human devastation. We depend the ""work of nature"" for our very lives."
1,"A fun read, but alas, it's misleading.","Rather than elucidating the sometimes little-understood relationships between species in an ecosystem, this book works to mystify the gaps in our knowledge. Make no mistake, it's a fun read and will appear to be informative, but you'll get the sense by the end of your reading that we know nothing about how ecosystems could've evolved, for example. But I think we know more than that, and we're learning every day."
2,Problems But No Solutions,We used this book for an Ecological Processes class during my Zoology master program. The books best point was that it was well written. The content was well researched but was very disturbing. The author covers many grim aspects of how humans have damaged ecosystems. From an ecological perspective I thought this book presented problems but no solutions. It is easy to find problems as there are many other books written on similar subjects but in order to be great scientific literature the authors should try to provide solutions. Overall the book left me with a negative view of human kind and a poor outlook on the future of our planet. I give it three stars because it was written well even if the content was lacking.
5,couldn't put it down,"I really enjoyed this book, found it very disturbing and uplifting all at the same time. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Read and reread some parts. Going back and forth from Lynch's Book to this book. I'm buying it for my daughter, she will LOVE it"
5,"If you gamble, get the book","I bought it and it totally changed the way I play and I have made money this season. If you play, get the book."
2,Disappointing..,"I had fairly high hopes for this book after reading the online reviews. What a letdown. Don't expect to learn anything that will help you gamble. The most interesting part of bookmaking--making and moving lines--is glossed over (author mentions software to retrieve lines from online sources). Instead, the book is full of inane details such as which color pen to write with while taking bets.If you are looking for a condescending read describing how to run an illegal business which will continue to become less and less profitable as online casinos flourish, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book to teach you about sports betting, I would recommend Stanford Wong's ""Sharp Sports Betting""."
2,No how to.,"I bought this book because I wanted to understand how to set Las Vegas quality lines. Hopes of one day moving there and becoming a bookie. This book does not explain how to set the lines for the numerous sporting events it talks about and your not going to become a good bookie without knowing how to set the lines. In lieu of all you gamblers out there: the knowledge needed to set the lines is very hard to ascertain, and, if you want to be successful at gambling you must set a better spread or line than the bookmaker. This book teaches you how to become highly illegal, it does not teach you the most important thing to know when betting on sports or becoming a successful bookie."
1,Nothing special,"If ure a player looking for a book to help u beat the odds, this book will not help u at all. All it will tell u is that parlays and teasers are sucker bets,and that public mostly bets the favorites, come on, if u didnt know that before ure not really a player. All it basicly tells u is how to run ur business if u decide to become a bookie, and how to get started.For me it was a waste of money and time really, but if ure new to gambling it might help u."
1,Clueless Author Comes to Mind,"Save your money, do not buy this book as you may find out you know more about the subject of bookmaking than the authors.Evidence of the authors cluelessness, in the book they write, ""there are no winning gamblers"". This is completely false. Quite a few sharp sports bettors making a living at sports betting. Just ask any Las Vegas sportsbook as they escort another pro from their casino sportsbook threatening arrest if they should return. There are more false writings throughout the book. Not recommended reading."
4,Made a significant difference,"This helped a lot on my last trip overseas. It significantly reduced the pain in my but from the economy class airline seats that normally feel like I'm sitting on a hard piece of wood. I'm sure there are more comfortable pads out there, but I was able to conveniently deflate this one and carry it around with me in my carry on luggage."
2,"Good, but leaker","I agree with the other reviews---good cushion until it leaks. I had one replaced under warranty, now that's leaking, along with another we own. For more than a short time useage, buy something better, maybe Roho or Air Hawk."
2,Wonderful Cushion When It Doesn't Leak,Being disabled I use these cushions often. Because I'm familar with the products quality I have purchased 10 to 12 at a time. Even though they are warranted 1 year they usually develope a leak in about 3 to 4 months. I would suggest buying only 1 cushion at a time.
4,Happy With Cushion,"Overall I happy with this cushion I am still playing with it to get the air level set for my comfort zone. So far is has releived most of my discomfort.>>Just wish it came in a ""larger"" size."
2,will be donating it,"We had yet another long flight coming up and after reading the various reviews bought both this one and the Thermarest Lite Seat (Burnt Orange)to give a try. We first used both around the house and in the car, really never cared much for this one and only took the Thermarest for the long flight as this one just really never felt all that great. I always appreciate all the reviews so it may be preferred by some but our Thermarest won hands down and I have ordered 3 more of those so we have them in both cars and in our travel gear so we don't have to keep remembering where it is- but this one- not a good match for us and I am sending it out with our next Goodwill donation. Hope this helps others trying to make the choice, reviews really help us and in this instance- I am able to actually compare the two products."
1,Not liked,The cushion is hard not soft to set on. Would not recomend it. Wish I had returned it. Still looking for soft product for traveling.
2,"Genuine Corflex Medic-Air Seat Cusion 18"" x 15 3/4""",It is not well made. Did not do the job over time. We bought 2 and it just did not hold the air over a period time.
4,Mrs.,I purchased this item for my husband who has severe rheumotoid arthritis (as well as many other diagnosed back problems This product seriously DOES help when he uses it in his recliner while watching TV.
1,Doesn't hold air,"The most important thing a blow-up cushion should do is hold air. This one doesn't. It is comfortable when partially inflated, but only holds air about 15 minutes."
2,Worked well... for a while,I guess for what it's worth the product worked... but after like 3 months it deflated and I had to keep blowing it up everytime before use. Poor insulation. It's been laying flat on my chair for the last couple months as I cannot keep blowing it everyday... Oh well... so much for the AIR cushon. Will get other type next time.
1,Disappointed!!!,"I purchased this item last year just before Christmas. At first it was great... it created a nice cozy atmosphere in our living room... It heated nicely... and then about two months after purchasing it just quit heating!!! I think the item is a little expensive to only work for a couple months!!! Extremely disappointed with this item... Will be looking for another one this year, but will definitely be looking at other makers/brands... I will not purchase Dimplex again!!!"
2,Does Not Give Off Enough Heat,"I bought this item to heat a 10 X 12 room. I had the french doors closed, and I put the Dimplex Electric Stove on high. After 25 minutes it still did not warm up the room. You have to sit very near it to get heat. I use oil to heat my home. I wanted to use this heater instead of the oil for a few hours. It is no good just as a primary heating source.The flame looks very real, and it is well built.If you want something for heat buy a 220v item."
2,Doesn't last,"We bought two of these. We LOVED them at first. They heated the house very well. And I thought the fake fire was rather pretty to look at. Just shy of 2 months they both stopped working. They consistently overheated. I like that it has an auto shut off feature, but it kinda was (is) the middle of winter and our main heat source. Hopefully we just got (2?!) a defective unit and this isn't the norm. I really did like the heater while it lasted."
4,Nice looking heater,"For the price it's a good little heater that looks like a real stove. It almost looks like a real stove but not quite. 8/10 or so for realism. It has a mirror that reflects the ""flames"" which actually makes it more real. When the room is completely dark it somehow doesn't look as good.The heat it puts out is noticeable and sufficient, although I wish the heater part at the bottom was a little less conspicuous. Ads a nice atmosphere to the room. I can however, notice a pattern or two to the random flames. All in all it's a good electric stove."
3,Dimplex Stove,"great product, but I should have gotten the larger one ... have it on a screened in porch and the heater is totally ineffective ... but it is very pleasing to look at"
1,QUIT PUTTING OUT HEAT,"I BOUGHT 2 OF THESE BECAUSE THEY LOOK GREAT,BUT WITHIN A SEASON OF USING THEM ONE COMPLETLY QUIT WORKING,THIS WAS WITHIN A YEAR AFTER PURCHASING IT,WELL NOW THE OTHER ONE HAS QUIT PUTTING OUT HEAT,I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND BUYING THIS"
1,Disappointed,I researched these stoves and purchased the Dimplex because it had the most realistic looking flame and was a bit wider and more real looking than the others on the market. I sent it back because it did not make any difference in the temperature of our room and there was a clear light bulb stuck in the front with the logs -- clearly visible -- and no way to remove it. VERY disappointing.
1,not so happy,i paid for something that only worked for 30 days. i do not have any children and i do take care of my possesions.... so therefor i lost out on time and money!!!!!!!!!!! im not happy by far!
4,"Pretty & realistic looking, but doesn't put out enough heat","The flame is realistic looking, especially at night. In the daytime it is subtle. Visitors always have to inspect to see if the flames are real. Also, even when off the foiling looks like glowing embers (and I would usually be wary of this for fear of the phoney look, but it really looks very real unless your eyes are 2 inches away!) I love it, as it adds a coziness to my living room. But, for use as a heater, it does not heat up the space--only warm if you sit directly in front of it. If the heater worked well I would give it 5 stars."
3,Nice to look at....,"but the heat output is not that great. I have a portable Honeywell heater which puts out more heat than these electric stoves and paid half the price for it. In order to warm my rooms up (I purchased 2 of these Dimplex CS1205 stoves) I leave it on all day & night and my rooms are not even close to 400 sq ft. I'm giving it 3 stars because it does heat up the room, but takes a lot LONGER than 15 minutes as one reviewer wrote. It takes about 10-12 hours to heat up a 15x15 room nicely (about 65 degrees)."
4,"Cute, no circulation","I agree with all on the look of heater. It's cute and welcoming. The heater just doesn't have any kind of circulation for the heat, so it doesn't seem very effective to me. I use it in combination with another heater, and they seem to get the job done. My room is larger than they recommend for this size heater. I use an air filter in front of it that blows the air, it works much better this way, though not as attractive.If left on all day, it definitely will keep the chill away. I'm in Southern California, so the cold isn't quite freezing, and generally, days are warmer."
4,Good little heater--seems to be efficient.,"For some reason the fan stopped working for a few days and I was about to throw it out. Then the fan started working again. No problems since or otherwise. I use it to heat a large bedroom connected to an office and heats both rooms with no problem. Very quiet. I wish there was a way to use the heater without the simulated fire (which is surprisingly realistic and comforting), but, hey, it is what it is."
3,love it but short shelf life..,"It is perfect for my needs,but I am on my third one...i use them sparingly, but last a year at most"
1,Stove stopped working months after purchase.,"This stove worked great but only for a couple months. One day the heat just gave out and I decided to keep the flame going just for the look of it on occasion and then that gave out too. Very frustrating! Do not purchase this item. There is no way to fix it. One positive aspect is that it's child safe. The ""glass"" never gets too hot that it can burn. I wish it was made better. Throwing it out today."
1,I never received my order,There is NO TRACKING information on my order and it was supposed to ship 7 Dec.... it's now the 16th and no heater...
1,Dimplex CS1205 Compact Electric Stove,"Bought this for use in the Cleveland OHIO area. Very nice attractive unit, flames look real. The item is ready to use right out of the box. Just plug in. Its very efficient in heating a room upto 350 sq.m. I would recommend buying this for use in your family room (as we have it) or bedroom. Whisper quite and very efficient.UPDATE: March 2011Unfortunately this died, no more warm heat. Nevertheless, AMAZON were amazing not only did they refund the costs but also arranged for the defective piece to be picked up ...great customer service."
2,didn't work well !,I purchased this heater for my son to help heat his small living room to use in addition to his gas heat. It worked great the first day. My daughter in law loved the size and said the flame was a nice touch too. The second day however it sparked when she turned it on and the high setting wouldnt work at all. We returned it with no problems (the return procedure couldnt have been easier ! ) I was refunded the full amount. I wish it had worked better because they liked the product ..despite it not operating well.
3,I'm shocked at how good this is.,"My heater arrived today. I plugged it in, turned it on, and noticed how quiet it was. I could hear the fan, but I found it soothing rather than distracting. While the fire doesn't look completely realistic, it's real enough to provide ambience. I only have one real complaint, and that is I wish it came with its own thermostat. My master bedroom heated up very quickly, and it's a rather large room in a new construction apartment. Since I spend a lot of time in my bedroom and hate turning on the central heating to warm a whole apartment, I expect that this will get a lot of use. This model does not have a door in the front that can open, but I don't mind. I checked the sides, back and top after leaving the heater on for a few hours, and they did not warm up appreciably. I would have rated this unit 4 stars, but I haven't owned it long enough to say how good the components are and whether they will last."
2,Cute but weak,"I have to say I bought the little heater primarily for its decorative value. I have it in a vacation cabin I rent out in North Georgia. One of the bedrooms is in the basement, and it stays chilly year round even though the climate in the area is generally mild. It works well enough in the tiny, windowless room, 10X10, but I can see that it would be useless in a large drafty room. The warm air flowing out from underneath is more like somebody's warm breath. I will say that it is cute as a button and the ""fire"" is cheery."
2,Really Doesn't Heat Much,"I have to agree with the handful of disappointed folks. I was so excited for this heater. It looks as charming as I'd hoped, but when we put ours in a chilly 12X14 back room it felt like warm breath was coming from it, but not much more heat than that. In fact, we get more heat from our tiny $24 Lasko ceramic heater. I think if I run this Dimplex for an hour, it can warm the room up just a litte bit, but I'm left to wonder: is the room just too cold to warm up? Or did we get a bad heater?"
5,Great product for the price,"This stove is great for centralized heat when you want that ""cozy"" feeling and the ambiance of a real fire.Its economical and does heat a small room quickly.I bought it for my mother in law who endures MAINE winters but it could be used in any climate to get that quick warm up,such as a cabin,outside patio,or garage."
5,Love the stove,I received the stove on time and have enjoyed it during this cold weather. It was shipped on time and works perfectly. The 3-D fire looks like a real flame.
3,Smells Funny,"This product is alright--it looks nice and puts off an okay amount of heat. However, the stove makes the basement smell bad when running. I hope that the smell will go away over time, the product is still really new. As of right now, I don't like to run it because I know the basement will stink in about 30 min after turning the stove on."
2,"Shortlived, fire hazard","Heater does look nice and have good flames. I had taken another reviewers advice and bought bed risers to the heater up off the floor, they gave a 4"" clearance. Without them the heating element was barely an inch off the floor and with carpet, less. It did a great job cutting the chill during the MN months until the plug started overheating. It got to the point that even short times being on would melt the plug.Lasted on 4 months. Ridiculous quality."
4,Good little heater but really shot up electric bill,"I've owned this heater for over a year now, and it does what its supposed to provided its not to close to the wall, if it is it will shut itself off, the heater has held up well and I haven't had any other problems with it and I live in the mountains of the sierra and have used it a lot, but at 18cents an hour it costs almost $5 a day to run if you leave it on nonstop so until these units are more electrically efficient I won't likely be getting another one."
3,Only last fifteen months,"Purchased with recommendations from a friend. My electric bill went down maybe 40-50/month during winter. I closed off my bedroom and slept in the living room which was pullout which was uncomfortable (the pullout - not the heat). Best to get a thermostat to use with heater. During the last days of its life - I had to turn on my electric heat which raised my bill. Something went wrong with the on/off switches and couldn't be fixed - wouldn't turn off. It kept me warm - probably paid for itself, but after 15 months, I don't understand why it crapped out??"
5,"Funny and wonderful, a must read!","Although I'm only 21, and probably one of her younger readers, I felt not necessarily 30, but all that comes along with it, coming on. I found her writing wonderful and witty, but not insubstantial in its insights and suggestions. I loved how Julie Tilsner was able to give the topic credence without taking it all--herself, the issue, her readers--too seriously. I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages, and am passing it on to my other 21 year old girlfriends, and definitely keeping it on hand--in 9 years I'll need it for real."
1,Funny but unreal,"I understand that it is a book of humor.But first, this book assumes that the mayority of women turning 30 is single. Second, it also assumes that if you have a stablished career and a confortable financial position achieved by hard work before turning 30, something's wrong with you.I agree with some reviewers that the targeted readers are teenagers or those who have not passed yet their teen's years.Please do not take this book seriously.Even though it's funny there are much better funny things to do with your time."
4,I have my list of things to do even after I turn 30!,"Tilsner's book is a scream. It's short on substance but it doesn't pretend to be anything more. She packs up all this woman ""baggage"" into a little neat overnight bag. So it makes for a great read when a normally confident woman suddenly needs a quick fix of self-help. So here I am 2 years short of 30 and I have this list screaming with all these wonderful things that I want to do even after I'm way past 30 and this feels really good."
2,Targeted at a small demographic group,"The Reader from Athens said it very well, and I agree completely with every part of her review. I was barely worried about turning 30 until I read this book. Let that be a word of warning to potential readers - now it's as if all these other people's fears of turning 30 have been implanted in my brain. And the author's reassurances fell flat with me - too many were based on just some chatty conversations with the author's many ""girlfriends"". I think there's some helpful information in the book, and it's often interesting to hear about other people's experiences - but I didn't like the author's implication that we're all ""chicks"" hoping to get ""preggers"" before the dreadful age of 30."
2,"Humorous, but insubstantial","Tilsner's book gave me a few good chuckles, but there's not much substance to it. It left me with the feeling of ""Is that all?"" Although I'm definitely a member of Tilsner's generation, and can identify with her humor, I was turned off by Tilsner's constant references to her friends and herself. She even plugs a friend's website in the book--a gesture I found somewhat unsavory. If you're looking for something thoughtful and informative, this book isn't it. But, if you're looking for humor and ""lite"" writing, you'll enjoy it."
1,"""Chicks"" a Glib Look at 30","Though I appreciate what she's trying to accomplish (make women feel better about turning 30), Tilsner's book is a turn-off. The author's ""wacky"" tone is SO present as to offend. This book is for a small sliver of women in the US -- the ""popular crowd."" Her advice? Better get a man, an SUV, and a facelift ASAP. Don't bother with this surface fluff."
2,Not easy to relate to as a 30 yr old,"I was extremely disappointed with this book and the fact that none of the reviews I read seemed to mention that the author is highly un-relatable unless you happened to be a binge drinking, drug taking, promiscuous girl in your 20's. She mentions many times the use of recreational drugs and talks about drinking and sleeping with random friends or acquaintances. She is shocked when she finds out that one of her girlfriends has only slept with two men in her life, ""gasp""! This was hardly my experience in my 20's so I wasn't having her same fear of ""growing up"". I have been responsible most of my life and was more looking for a book with guidance about ""where does it go from here""? There were a few funny or poignant moments here and there and it was a quick read so I gave it 2 stars rather than 1, but if you are a married woman on a decent career path at 29, you will not find this book is for you."
1,Amateur writing,"My suggestion to other readers is - do not waste your time or money on this book! When the big 30 began to approach I ordered the book from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very disappointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information and it would be funny. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of drivel. With the constant hysteria about turning 30 in this book, it will make you have a mental breakdown. The book feeds into this false culture of fear. Also, the book reads like a college term paper - a bad college term paper."
5,SUPER!!!,"This was an awesome cd!!! My personal favorite is ""Classic Ignorant one"". The songs have such a great beat that sticks with you for days. I catch myself singing these songs days at a time. I love how the back-up singer, SMITA, joins right in and makes the music sound even more harmonious. Great album!!!! I love it!!!"
4,Excellent,"This CD is such a change of pace from the everyday rap and alternative that's being played on the radio these days. It's a completely new sound (it's got a kind of Indian sound, which fits because the person who wrote the songs is Indian). I think it's great. If you can't find anything that you like in today's music, give this one a chance."
3,"Sturdy, but one design flaw","Sturdy and heavy. I believe the frame is steel rather than aluminum like my last one. Seat is lower than my last one, too. This is more comfortable for me because I am only 5'3"", but because of the design the seat does not have a catch when it is lifted up to use the basket underneath or to fold it up. The heavy wooden seat flops around when I load it in and out of my trunk. I am trying to figure out a way to make a catch for the seat that will not decrease its functionality. If I wasn't hauling it around everywhere, this probably wouldn't bother me."
4,good read,"My friend saw similar issues in my children that her own had struggled with. She did some research a few years earlier and had found this book, then recommended it to me. I'm grateful she did. I had no idea that allergies/sensitivities could manifest themselves in so many ways! Its been 4 years now that I read the book and after making some changes to our diets, my kids are showing much improvement. It's taken a while, but the book was a great tool in helping me understand how to best help my kids without medicating and poking with needles for tests."
1,Don't waste your money,"Very one sided, kind of hooey-ish. You're better off using common sense. If you eat apples and you have a reaction, don't eat them again. It's that sort of thing. Plus the author is also trying to brain wash you into leading a vegan lifestyle, which I have no problem with. However, the book should then be retitled as such."
3,Dissapointed b/c of printing mistake,"The book itself is very informative for me because my son suffers from allergies. I was however dissapointed because the page numbers went from 1-31, 82-101, 1-31. This must have been a printing mistake! This is the kind of book you would want to look up something in the index and then find the page number but you can't do it!!!!"
2,Probably Won't Help,"The book is okay, and I already live a lifestyle and with a diet like the book suggests, but still I suffer from pretty bad air-borne allergies. I am healthy overall, so I can attest to the benefits of a high vegetable lifestyle, but for that there are plenty of other books. This book is seriously lacking in references. The author often states her opinions as facts. When research is used, it is weak from low quality journals. There is no JAMA or Lancet stuff in this one.I would love to support the author as I am a huge fan of a healthy lifestyle, but this book is not the way. For that I would stick with something like Dr. Weil or Dr. Ornish. They are much more rigorous doctors."
4,"Good, but have a dictionary handy","I really enjoyed this book. It seemed more like a collection of short stories than a novel to me, which I liked. My only trouble was that there was a lot of French slang that I didn't know so I had to get out my dictionary a lot."
3,good gooves,"I purchased this especially for ""Say Yes"" and ""Butterflies"", both great tunes, but I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity on this albumn."
4,"Solid, Funky and Soulful Debut",Ha...ha...ha...these ladies are bangin'! I love it. I love the fusion of the poetic stance from the Floacist and the highs & lows from the Songstress... Baddd album (meaning good of course) and the remake of Butterflies is great. I will talk about these ladies for many years to come 'til my grandbabies get to hear them and sip lemonade over reminiscants of the ol' days. hehehe...2 words: Cop it!
1,Hmmm...,I can't say that I liked this CD. I've only listened to it once and that was the last time I wanted to. Does anyone want to buy my copy from me?
3,Not Quite...,"If you were expecting some neo-soul, or even anything really different than ""radio soul"", sorry to burst your bubble. With the exception of 3 songs there is nothing to write home about on the CD, however those three are REALLY great. Those being, ""Floetic"", ""Hello"", and ""Opera"". It should also be said that ""Hello"" is one of the best R&B songs released all year. But this is part of the problem; the disc is full of slow, passionate ballads that after ""Floetic"" feel like a letdown. I feel that this is a very talented group that is holding back their best work."
3,I feel cheated...,"When I first heard ""Floetic"" I dug it. I didn't love it, but the vibe was definitely there. I had never heard of the group, The song was nice though, and the video was very cool (and original)The album came out, I pondered buying it, upon looking at the back I noticed Jazzy Jeff was the Ex. Producer of it. It was on sale so I picked it up. I expected a cool blend of an emcee and a singer. The formula of ""Floetic"" is there. But unfourtinally it's not here. That's not to say the album isn't good, as far as slow jams go they sound great, but I wanted more urban mixture music, and there isn't really any [more] here. The Singer ""Songstress"" has a nice voice. And the rapper ""Flowtress"" is decent, but she couldn't hold her own on the solo tip. This is a good album to chill out with your woman (or man) to. If you expected more ""Floetic"" stay away tho!"
2,Wack album,"I thought this cd was garbage...it's cliche' and the chick who does the rapping is monotonous and boring. She reminds me of those people who are always referring to ""African kings and queens"" same 'ol same 'ol at the poetry readings I used to go to around Philly (not everyone, of course). I like British soul (i.e. Omar) and was hoping for better vocals (i.e. Ledisi) and better lyrics (i.e. Meshell or Lauryn), but was bitterly disappointed by this album. Once you have evolved past just blindly and immediately knee-jerk responding to all things ""Neo-Soul"" and begin to look for quality, the transparency of stuff like this becomes apparent. I can't taste the juice in this watery, pulpy mess. The only redeming quality to this cd was that it was a gift. Too bad...my wife could've saved her money."
5,Beautiful music,"I love this album! Especially songs like Ms. stress, Fun, Butterflies, Hey you, Say yes, Getting late, I get a headache and Mr. messed up. I've had this CD for a while and it has not once lost its momentum. I always seem to miss them when they come to the Baltimore/DC area...but I want to make it a habit to see them perform live."
5,Best neo soul cd of the YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DONT MISS THIS,"FLOETRY'S ALBUM IS TRULY WHAT IS SAYS, FLOETIC WITH EVERY TRACK MAKING YOU STOP WHAT YOUR DOING AND JUST LISTEN TO THE LYRICS ABOUT LIFE, RELATIONSHIPS ETC.....IF U LOVE NEO-SOUL LIKE JILL, ERYKAH, SADE AND MESHELL, YOULL LOVE FLOETRY'S MODERN POETIC, NEO-SOUL, HIP-HOP FLAVOR.......YOULL LOVE IT....I COULDN'T STOP PLAYING IT AND STILL CAN'T...."
4,Smooth flow,"I give this cd 4 stars and I am only knocking one off because I am a bitter person. Soul is probably my least favorite genre of music (maybe jesus rock is tied) I just felt a twinge of disappointment after ""Big Ben"" that there weren't more tracks with a rap edge. Still for people who love hiphop and generally dont enjoy soul music, there is still a bunch to enjoy. ""Floetic"" (the song) sounds like it was produced by De La. ""Fun"", ""Mr. Messed Up"", ""Opera"" will please anyone who enjoys Lauren Hill and the ilk. There are about a 1/2 dozen straight soul songs, but its neo soul - more jazzyfatnastys than full on love-me-down shrapnel. Overall the cd is a great choice for those that want to check out how heartfelt soul music can be - WITHOUT being cheesy."
5,Amazing!,"When I bought this album, it stayed in my CD player for an entire month. I love originality, and Marsha (the vocalist) has a very unique tone quality. There was excellent background vocals, and some very good production. I think that this album is (or should be) considered a classic in soul music."
4,What a start!,"These two English girls put together a very good album. Their blend of spoken word and soul is infectious. My favorite song is ""Say Yes"". I really loved the singer's phrasing and delivery, she reminded me of Michael Jackson in some ways, her emotional intensity is amazing. I felt that at times the speaking and singing got in the way of each other, also they could have used less programming. All in all, a great buy."
4,Britian's finest...,"It took a couple of plays for me to get used to the CD as a whole. But it is a great Cd after i gave it a chance. There acccents are wonderful and they make me want to be British. ""Butterfly's"" is better with there voices, this is the song that they wrote for Micheal Jackson orginally. Besides Micheal Jackson they have written songs for many other artists that have hit the top 20's. The Cd is a funky-upbeat, hip-hop meets London funk. It is refreshing and Floetry defintely has something good on there hands. Songstress's voice is eloqent in ""Opera"" and ""Getting Late"" is a great song and shows off both of the gilrs talents.This Cd would be a nice additon to anyone's collection because they can fit into many genre's of music, R&B (mostly Rythm), Hip-Hop, or Neo-Jazz Funk...Give it a try."
5,oh yes a creative dou about time,"We need more acts like floetry in the music biz for those tired of the usual mtv-bet bullcrap we see everytime dj jazzy jeff is shedding some light to the bling bling disease with these 2 talented girls along with jill scott, and musiq I would get this definetly."
5,The Nuclear Bomb- Go treat yourself and get it!!!,They are even better live!!! It would take to long to say how nice this CD is. GO GET IT...DON'T BURN IT!!!
4,Limited Excellence,"Walkenbach provides some first-rate coverage of Excel basics and his ""Quick Reference"" is highly readable, but at least one core spreadsheet subject--macros--is encountered briefly on page 22, then again only in the glossary. Still, worth the money (no five stars though). Note: If you're studying for MOUS certification, I recommend buying MacMillan's quick study guide in addition to Walkenbach."
3,Kinda mediocre album,"This albums alright,but it doesnt truely show the talent of X.Songs worth mentioning are ""Use your luv""and ""burning for you""...otherwise there are some pretty commercial songs on this album including ""beachball""which is basically on every major techno compilation.If you want the best of X try the club experience cd's"
4,Opinion on this album,"....Most of the song i knew they are popular if you listen to Trance; Breath and Melodrama are well known songs. In overall album is Ok, actually i gave only four stars because not all songs are so great. Some of them just shallow, not much melody in them, but i still suggest you to buy this album if you like Trance. ..."
4,3 Chamber Shower Organizer,This appears to work well. It saves space on in the shower. It mounted to the wall easily and I like the place to hang my razor.
2,Broken and Missing Pieces,"This product was disappointing. The clip to attach the mirror arrived broken in half. Also, both the glue and the tape to attach the setup to the wall were missing."
4,So far.... pretty AWESOME!!!,"I put this up about a week ago and so far, I love it!! I'll pass on two hints/tips; #1 - If you intend to use the mirror feature, make sure you duplicate the lighting on a typical morning (or whenever you shower) BEFORE you stick this thing to the wall! Under typical lighting conditions (i.e. lights on, sun coming through window, shower door/curtain closed, etc.), hold the unit up to different locations on your shower wall to make sure that your face is getting enough light as to be seen clearly in the mirror. I didn't do this and now my face it a little dark and hard to see when I shave! .... #2 - I bought a gel-type shaving cream from the local dollar-only type store that is in a standard squeeze-tube, and it works GREAT in the third pump. So I've got mine set-up to hold shampoo, shower gel, and shaving gel. Pity there's no label that reads ""Shave Gel"" or similar. .... So far, I recommend this!!!"
2,Disappointing,Everything worked fine for a few weeks and then the shower gel would just keep on dribbling out after using it and we'd see a puddle of shower gel on the shower floor. I tried changing the a thicker variety of shower gel (not that I should have to) but still no joy. I am returning the product today.
5,Perfect,Great looking and super easy to install. Cleaned up all our shower clutter and the mirror is a great bonus! The tab to open the unit to refill is a little scary because you keep thinking it will break....but it doesn't and it works so....thank you Ulti-Mate!
4,"Good planer, but it is a sniper","This is a nice 12.5 inch planer for less $$$ than the 12 inch models. It is my first planer so keep that in mind.I have run a 12"" X 20"" X 2"" maple cutting board with excellent results. It seems to have more snip with narrower stock. 1""x4"" ash, red oak, and pine seem to have excess, easily visible snipe for about 3"" on each end. It is best to run long boards, then cut them to size and discard the ends.I like the carry handle, but this unit is heavy and awkward to carry. Minor assembly needed upon receipt was a breeze. With $25 off coupon and free shipping, it is easily the best deal on the net. BTW: the free shipping was FedEx 3 day!!!!!!"
5,Good Planer,"Worked, almost right out of the box. I was unable to find the dust collection hood for this planer. Snipe was only apparent on some of the board runs."
4,delta planer,"I bought the 12"" shopmaster planer and it does a good job, except for the sniping of the board ends. I found that if I feed strips of wood on either side of board, on entry and exit of board it about eliminates the snipe. I hope this will be helpful to someone."
1,Not For Beginners Either,"I should have taken the ""snipe"" comments more seriously, though some people don't seem to think it's as big a deal as I do. To me, gouging 3 inches on the front and back of every piece fed through the machine makes the tool completely unusable. The whole point of a planer is to make the piece a uniform thickness! I can't believe Delta would even release a tool that does this! Spend a little more and get a machine with 4 posts."
5,Great for beginners,I was amazed at the results and so far have enjoyed the performance. I looked for a long time for the perfect planer for the cost and this met all my expectations.
2,Did not do the job.,"Bought this product with hopes it would stop/ slow my wifes hair loss. She has been taking Horsetail Extract for about a year and there seems to be little, if any, change in the progress of pattern baldness. Cannot say I would recommend this product."
5,Great Book With Many Answers I was Looking For,"I have struggled my whole life with my weight. I believed that in order to lose weight, I needed to be hungry and exercise. This book has changed everything for me. It explained why my body craves food at certain times so I could learn to manage it. I no longer am starving and have lost 65 lbs. Of course, I had to change my whole way of looking at food and the way I eat. This book has taught me to plan what I'm going to eat. No longer do I leave the house without being prepared. I take food every place I go. I bought at least 8 of these books and have handed them out to others. I highly recommend this book."
2,"Good thought, bad design on sprayer","The batteries only last a few minutes. If you have a lot to spray as I do, you'll need a pack of batteries to go with it. The two AA batteries are not nearly strong enough to keep it going for long. I've already used up four batteries, (two batteries, two times) and the sprayer is just over 1/2 empty, so my guess is it'll take about eight batteries to get through the jug. They should have designed it with a 9V or something. I suppose if you have rechargeable batteries, it may be worth it, but batteries are getting expensive. If you have a very small yard and very little to spray around, this will work for you, but then why would you need this large jug for such a small yard...?Also, since there is no long nozzle, you need to bend over to spray and that gets to your back in a short time. As I said the thought was good for a powered sprayer, but the design has much to be desired. I won't buy this one again."
3,Good to see Chris and Terry back.,"I adore Faye Kellerman's books, and my favorite in this series has always been Justice, so I was delighted to see Chris and Terry back.That said, the parts of the book without either Chris or Terry, were not as well plotted or as exciting as usual.I found the book a bit plodding as the whole drug angle unfolded, and I thought the final showdown left something to be desired. By the end of the book, I didn't care about who had actually committed the murder. I was much more interested in the second-tier storyline.I do not feel that each book must stand on its own and I think returning to characters from another book is like a reward for her loyal readers."
2,oy vey...,"I have been a Faye Kellerman fan for years...but this book was a big disappointment. Incoherent at times, inaccurate at times, I only give it two stars because I am still a fan of Peter and Rina, which was all that kept me with the story...yes, I made it to the end. I found the story to be bizarre, the Donatti character ridiculous, and it is quite annoying to be asked to remember plotlines from a book you may (or may not) have read years ago...overall, way too many holes in the story. Even the title makes no sense. Ms. Kellerman can and has done much better than this!! Read Milk and Honey. Leave this one on the discount shelf."
2,not great,i thought this book was very slow. i couldn't get into the plot at all. eventually i just skimmed and skipped sections to get to the end so that it would be finished.
3,"Great Psychopath, Generic Story","I felt the parts involving any interaction with the psychopath Chris Donatti were excellent, his characterization, superb. Otherwise I found this murder mystery to be generic. I didn't learn new anything about New York."
2,It Just Gets Worse...,"There was a time when Mrs. Kellerman's books could be counted on to be better written and be superior to her husband's books. However, the last four books have shown a serious decline of Cronwellian purportions.It would seem that the Kellerman's are joined in a competition which pits them in a battle to career death. Or stated in other terms, how long will people continue to buy name brand authors who phone in and otherwise pad their creations with stilted and laughable dialogue, stories in which a child can tell whodunit with the first line of dialogue, and more phony introspection about the demands of police work and/or Yuppie Orthodox lifestyle challenges?The challenges of delivering a new book every year to support the Kellerman's lifestyle, might be better spent perhaps writing about two married best seller writers who have run out of fresh ideas, discipline plotting and respect for the people who read their recycled exercises in vanity."
1,Not the best !,"Before reading this book, I had read ""The constant garderner"" of Le Carré, after having read it, I read ""Death in the holy orders"" of P.D.James. To that , I shall add that I have read all Kellerman (both Ks)'s books, but this is just a fast-read book, without any depth, with irrealistic and incoherent situations, meeting for instance this ""psycho-killer"" who will bring back peace in the mind of the child molested in vol. 1 of the complete series ! No research in the psyche of the characters, it is as watching a thriller, not as reading a book asking for more than simply action!"
2,Save your money,"Borrow it from a library if you MUST read it, but please...don't fritter away your money. The earlier Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus novels were intense and gripping. This one is just...rotten. The characters are two-dimensional and unlikeable for the most part."
2,where did she go wrong?,"I have read the entire Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus series and am a huge fan, but this book was by far the WORST one out of them all. I kept reading, waiting for it to start getting good, never happened (and the addition of ""cd"" into the story was just all too convenient). Nonetheless, I still highly recommend all of the other books in the series."
1,Oy Vey--this is awful.,"Ms. Kellerman is an excellent writer in need of a good story. Her incessant and extensive descriptions of the beauty and perfection of her continuing main character, Rina Decker,are a detracting factor in many previous books, as well as in this one. Poor character development,plus a confusing story with too many coincidences and loose ends, make this book heavy going."
4,Stone Kiss?,"I finished Stone Kiss several hours ago and just realized I have no idea what the title has to do with. Is it something relating to the overuse of Hebrew/Yiddish words which pepper the entire book with no definition for most of them (not even context clues)? I enjoy Ms. Kellerman's books, but this one seems to have even more unknown words and phrases than most of her books. Maybe there should be a glossary at the end of the story so we who are not Jewish can read the book and understand it. Or maybe we aren't meant to?"
2,stone kiss,"This is my least favorite in the Decker/Lazarus series. The mystery is lost somewhere in all the information about different Jewish sects. Where are the clues? The suspense? The only reason I gave the book a two is because I did plow through it to find out whodunit. Otherwise, it would have been a one or a zero if the option was available. Faye Kellerman is reminding me of Patricia Cornwell. Cornwell's early works were riveting and then suddenly, without explanation, they took a turn for the worse. In my opinion Faye Kellerman has taken that same corner. I still love the series, but will definitely wait to get the next one in paperback."
3,Too much translation,"I'm newly hooked on Faye Kellerman and her Peter/Rina series. Unfortunately, this book had far too much transation from Jewish to English in the first several chapters. It seemed redundant and made it laborious to read. I liked the plot and the characters very much and can't wait to read more of her novels."
3,Error,"This is going to sound strange since I have not yet read the book. My wife has possession and I am awaiting my turn.The reason that I am writing is that, despite the fact that I am an avid Faye Kellerman fan, I fear that this book will be spoiled for me.My wife has pointed out (and we have confirmed with serious authorities) that there is a serious error. Kellerman states that an uncle / neice liaison is Halachically forbidden and is the equivilant of incest. In fact, an uncle-neice liaison/marriage is perfectly acceptable. On the other hand, an Aunt / nephew liaison is absolutely prohibited.I was truly surprised that such an obvious error was allowed to creep into one of her books.I hope to contribute a complete review if I can get past this error.My rating is strictly preliminary."
5,Good protection for DVD player!,"The WDEC-10 EVA Molded 10-inch DVD Player Case (Black) does a very good job of protecting the 10-inch DVD player I purchased it to use with. Has plenty of room for DVDs, headphones, remote control, and straps which can be used to attach case behind headrest or between seats. The DVD player is strapped into the case securely into the case. My grandsons (ages 5 and 3) enjoy watching DVDs on car trips."
3,Not too impressed.,This case is a little bulky and one of the side pouches was bent in. Not as good as I expected. I would have returned it nut was going on vacation and didn't have time to exchange.
3,wrong case,"The product I received was the wrong case.It was suppose to be case logic in-car dvd player case, but what I got was a case logic dvd player case without the in-car feature!!"
4,Sleek bag to bring,This case is really nice. It's fits my 10 portable dvd player and has a pretty hard shell so it keeps it from being damaged. I found the same case in walmart for half the price. You may want to shop around your local stores.
3,"Ok as a case, dubious as a mount","I bought my son a Sony DVP-FX930 9"" DVD. This case works fine as a case but its other feature as a mount leaves a lot to be desired. It consists of a series of straps you run around the seat and headrest. It is a real PIA to install and remove. I would look elsewhere if you need a case to act as a mount. If you just need a case, it is fine."
4,Great for the price.,"I like this case and it works well for a 9"" DVD player. It has ample room for player and all accessories and a few DVD's. The only part that I was disappointed in is, it says that it has built-in earphone jacks and shows a picture of it on the product description, but after purchasing it 3 times, I have yet to receive one that actually has the built-in earphone jack. It actually shows the jack in the picture on the sleeve cover that comes around the case, but as yet I have not received one that has it. So don't expect it to come with one. Otherwise, a great case."
3,serviceable dvd case,"this case is fine for what it is. it is too bad that no one seems to be interested in making a quality case that protects your equipment, holds all accessories and looks good. this does that about as well as any i can find. dvd manufactureres should make their own cases to spec."
3,DVD Player Case,"This is a very nice case, it was just more then what I needed. It will be good to use whenever we have kids and can set it up for them to watch DVD in back seat."
5,Great product,"I bought 2 of theses for my kids' portable DVD players. One holds a 9 inch and the other holds a 7 inch. They both fit well and have plenty of room to hold cords and additional movies. There are straps to attach them to the vehicle headrests, but my kids would rather hold them on their laps."
5,great travel case!! roomy,I got this case for my 9 in portable dvd player! it's very roomy and has a lot of space!It also has capability to attach it in the car! I do not need that!It's a great case for going places!
4,Observation,"It's a wonderful product, I am satisfaction with this product. You can used in many thing... For your DVD player, Mini Computer, and your Books. It is very versatil."
5,"Delicious, crunchy, low calorie, low fat",These crackers are absolutely delicious. Head over to Sesmark's website to get an idea.[...]130 calories for 40 crackers!! and only 2.5 grams of fat. I'm in heaven. these are very hard to find in the stores. Stop & Shop stocked them as a test and I havent seen them since. I am hooked! everyone I have let taste these are blown away. The flavor is very subtle which makes them perfect alone or with dip or hummus. wheat free deliciousness for all you Celiac (gluten free) eaters.
2,The disk was broke...,"The book itself is a great reference tool. The disk that came with the book was broken because whoever mailed it didn't pack it right. When I contacted the seller, they said ""sorry"" but offered no replacement. Whatever."
3,Could be better!,"This book is a OK book. I would buy ""Programming visual basic.net (Core References) by Francesco Balena instead of this book. It fails in alot of areas to explain anything! Hey, I have heard good things in the past about the black book series, but don't waste your money on this one!"
1,The race card in scholarly clothing,I bought this book expecting the author to explore minority incareration and it's causes as opposed to other racial groups and compare what factors contribute to disporportionate racial bias in arrest statistics. In short I was looking for an honest evaluation of the dynamics that cause more blacks to be arrested. What I got instead was a cover to cover complaint and accusation on how unfair and racist the criminal justice system is. The author even goes so far as to suggest that if a law is broken more frequently by blacks then the lawmakers are racist. I'm a racist for not buying into his rant and you're a racist for reading my review. Don't waste your money on this book.... you racist!
3,"Ok, inexpensive, but too big.",These are not what I would call standard targets. Most indoor ranges would not allow me to use these without cutting them in half. Too long and low shots tend to ricochet off the floor. Will get smaller targets next time. Be sure to check dimensions before purchasing.
5,Fantasic price,"I have been going to the indoor range for a few years and paying up to $1.00 each for targets that are no where as detaled as these are, and these targets are the same one some police forces use for handgun certification.KJ"
5,Awesome targets... Buy them.,"These are awesome targets for the range or outdoors. Buy these targets if you are tired of purchasing range targets marked up by 50% or so. Pack of 100? I purchased two packs of 100 and just to let you know, 100 of these targets roled up is like taking a phone book the size of a human torso and rolling them up. Each 100 target order is rolled up into their own box and the stack is huge. I love them, you should buy them."
2,Cold War paranoia,"This book seems to have been written more to embarass the Clinton-Gore administration than to inform the public about the threat China's military poses to the public. It seriously overestimates the PLA's strength. For example, it talks about the 50 Su-27's and the possiblity of 30 Su-30's being ordered. While these are capable aircraft nearly 2/3 of China's airforce will still be composed of Korean and early Vietnam War era fighters. Many of these fighters lack even the most basic radar systems. It also fails to note that while China may be spending more on it's military in dollar terms, as a percentage of GDP it's military spending has fallen dramatically over the past 20 years."
1,Neocon nonsense,Another failed attempt to create a post-Cold War threat. Why would China bite the hand that feeds it and through investments keeps the Party in power and the masses satisfied?I wonder how much time the author has spent in China. Well I lived in both China & Taiwan (which is part of China) and speak Chinese so I will bet that I have a better idea what is going on in China than he.Yes there are elements that hate us and distrust us but the men at the top know that their survival is tied to a thriving economy that requires forreign $$$ - Japan and the USA are the main sources of this $$$.Now go write a book teling us how Iraq is a threat and why we need to invade that country cause your hype about China is baseless!
1,Never seen a more worthless 300-pager,"If there ever has been a book worth burning in the entire history of human civilization, it is this one from the verbal vomit of an American journalist."
1,stupidity of journalists,This book is nothing but a farce and is representative of the inferior intelligence of American journalists today. This book doesn't even deserve the lone star given for its ratings (but that's the lowest it can go on Amazon.com). The author of this book doesn't even deserve to be referred to by name as he is as stupid as a primitive chimpanzee from a prehistoric forest.
4,"Laugh now, cry later","I have read the book and have heard from its authors. I find alot of information that I know is going on. I am a designer for the military and I know that we are in trouble. America (billy & co.) has taken our national security and given it away for money. The pictures are not fakes, and they show that money is worth more than lives. It is sad....Y2K or not Taiwan will be first, then the regime will try and claim more, and can do so after christmas 99 when the watercraft is delivered to china from russia. Funny thing is: how can bill & co spend money when there is no where to spend it. PLEASE BOYCOTT ALL CHINESE GOODS, SERVICES, AND PRODUCTS!!!!"
1,Self-Serving Propaganda,"This book is not objective scholarship but China conspiracy trash in the tradition of Mosher, Gertz, Timperlake, Bernstein and Munro. First, it is not written by a so-called China expert but by a ultra conservative journalist who has jumped on the China bashing bandwagon in the wake of the Cold War. Second, it appears that many journalists have capitalized on the ""China Syndrome"" because it sells and makes for some interesting world possibilities. The reality is that despite China's ascent, China (the PRC) will never be fully accepted into Western world so long as they remain an authoritarian or a socialist free market economy state. With that mind, save your hard earned money and buy books from reliable sources on world affairs like RAND or the Brookings Institution. You'll thank me later."
1,A Travesty,"This book is disgusting, not only for its lurid descriptions and racist intentions, but for its butchering of the intellectual process. Its seems these ""authors"" awoke from some sick dream and decided to tell the world about it. It is fiction, completely made up. I gave my copy to the goodwill. They will probably stock it next to old issues of the ""Enquirer"",""Star"" or ""Weekly World News"". Truly, truly pathetic."
1,Angry About the Peace Dividend,"This book is a politcally motivated screed by two people who are clearly nostalgic for the arms race of the cold war. It is typical of right wing ignorance that a foreign enemy is needed as a stand-in for a real agenda. China will liberalize as globalism and the Internet take hold. Americans will not be tricked into a new cold war. These authors are as looney as Bill Gertz. Freak show journalists, with mail order educations."
3,laugh out loud,I enjoyed the clips in each of the biosThis made a good addition to my British Comedy collection of movies
3,Some funny stuff.,"Not to bad . ordered both,funny ladies and funny men. kept the ladies and donated the men's.Ladies were somewhat better. but not outstanding."
2,Could this game have any more bugs?,"This game would be great if it weren't for the flaws. The game crashes all the time, loads right during the middle of a jump or when you're going across traps, and often times the prince gets stuck in or around a wall. One time I even kept falling through the floor when I'd get to a certain point. After about four or five times falling through, the floor was fine. Wow, what an amazing piece of programming! Also, why do they even bother coding the characters with lip movements during their dialogs? The speech is way off the audio.The puzzles can be fun, and the freestyle combat is fun (although it gets to be monotonous when you find out the tricks). The gameplay certainly lasts a long time, especially when it freezes all the time, and you have to go back and redo everything you got through."
3,buggy! VERY buggy!,"Being a prince of persia fan since the first dos version, i bought this game without a second thought. 5 minutes into the game i realized it is the WORST PSP GAME so far. Instead of making a game for the psp, they only chopped ""Prince of Persia: Warrior within"" (part 2) and placed it in a UMD. During the game your sound (SPECIALLY MUSIC) will constantly go off for several seconds at a time. Loading sucks too, a good deal 15-20 seconds for the middle levels. They should've gone with ""Sands of time"" as the first psp release but what the hey.Good news is that gameplay is pretty much same if not better. Camera control is pretty decent, you can fix it however you want and it really helps when you are outnumbered. Other then that ""IT IS WARRIOR WITHIN"" so unless you have not played it on the xbox, ps2 or pc before OR you really like prince of persia series like me, I would not recommend that you buy this. Get it on some other console."
2,"Same old game, even worse in the PSP version","The Product Description first off is totally mis-leading, actually it's completely wrong. I though I was buying a new Prince of Persia game. It's the same exact game as Warrior Within for PS2, except they added in a few puzzles and areas, THANKS FOR THE TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!! Also the camera angles in this game are horrendous and you can't move the camera to a desired angle all the time. Which of course makes avoiding certain traps, figuring out puzzles, fighting etc. extremly difficult. I would not recommend buying this game at all. Not to mention the extremly long loading screen, and the pause to load more of the game in the middle of jumping, avoiding traps etc."
3,THIS IS THE SAME OF WARRIOR WITHIN,"First of all, the people from Ubisoft sell this game as a sequel of the game, PUNKS!!! This is the same Warrios Within game for PS2, beaware, this is not a diferrent game, is the same of Warrior Within"
2,Good and Bad,This game has good and bad parts. It is fun and can last a few weeks of fun. But it is EXREMELY hard. It is confusing and the camara SUCKS!!!!! It is better to get Grand Theft Auto for almost the same price but better fun
4,short but good,"Very short album (as far as the number of songs) but I thought all songs but the first one were very good. I have a couple other albums of theirs and already liked them before listening to this one... This one took me a couple of listens before I really got into it, but I am definitely hooked now. If you like YYYs, I'd recommend getting this album."
2,I'll say it,"I really really like their two full-length CDs ""Fever To Tell"" and ""Show Your Bones,"" and I find ""Is Is"" very very disappointing. I may not be yer typical YYYs fan because I like ""Show Your Bones"" even better than ""Fever To Tell,"" ""Show Your Bones"" is brilliant, in my opinion. Even so I don't think ""Is Is"" matches even ""Fever To Tell,"" and the first person that wants my copy of ""Is Is"" can have it."
1,"Oh my, what a dog.","I am sure that the people that put this together are the same people that make the safety films we see at the papermill. One section of voiceover is repeated entirely in the next section. The voiceover sometimes has nothing to do with the picture on the screen. There is music with a picture of Sinatra singing something completely different. Very poor color, jumpy movement between scenes. If you want a Sinatra video, buy ""A Man and His Music+Ella+Jobim"". It is glorious."
4,found this in a yard sale for 50cents and became a hero to my boys,"i found this one at a yard sale and picked it up for my boys. they have worn it out they watch it so much,and everytime we go to the pool we must play aquaman. these cartoons look and sound great and like i said my boys love it."
4,Probably for Researchers and Fanatics Only,"This hard-to-find book is superb if you are really interested in the history of land reclamation in the Netherlands throughout history. Having traveled there extensively, I became enthralled by the changes the land has gone through over the years, and the natural disasters that reformed the borders, only to have the Dutch reclaim them again. This is a serious textbook though, and not light reading. There are other, smaller texts that give a general overview. However, if, like me, you are looking for details, including great drawings that illustrate the history of the landscape, this is the book for you. It is worth the time it takes to locate one, and the price once you do."
2,Marketing Gimmick,"I've always been a bit wary about this recording - with the CSO captured in Symphony Hall in Chicago, and the organ part (the instrument at Chartres) dubbed in. This gimmick was apparently purely marketing-driven, given that Symphony Hall has a wonderful Moeller instrument. Moreover, I think that in the dub the DGG engineers went a bit off the deep end with the volume control. This is not how the work would sound live played by these forces in a normal concert venue sans dub. Or is that not the standard to be used?"
4,Good book,"Lee Hammond's Big Book of Drawing is a good book. I found that her individual books were far more helpful to me. This Big Book is just that, a large book that covers everything. For my purposes more specific instruction as in her other books have been more helpful. I thought I would save money by buying the ""all in one"" version but find that I would have been happier buying a couple of her individual books. Her instructions are very good and the tone of her writing is encouraging, especially to a beginner like me. If you are looking for very general instruction this is the book for you , if however you are focusing on a specific genre, get her smaller individual books."
4,great buy!,great buy! the book is very clear and explains everything step by step and it was at a great price! it came right away and is exactly as described!
5,Great Book!,Exactly as described. Would recommend this book for all ages. Very good learning tool for beginners. Shows very detailed instructions.
2,Not for a novice!!,"I had taken a drawing class five years ago as an absolute beginner and i learned quite a bit.Sorry to say that i hadn't picked up a drawing pencil since, so i decided to buy this book as a refresher and to learn some new skills but I was so disappointed in the lack of instruction given. The drawings in this book are absolutely amazing but I feel that for a beginner or novice it is terribly difficult to break them down into simple shapes and to figure out how to layer the shading. Even though this may have been a book book of drawing it is severely lacking in important basic information and should have been made even larger to accommodate a more in-depth approach."
4,Gift book,"The book was in very good condition. However, it did have some light finger smudges on the Title Page. The book arrived exactly when it was promised. I am very pleased with this purchase."
5,INSTRUCTIONAL DRAWINGS,This is just the book I was looking for. Plenty of details and how-to's. Very instructional with color pictorials and step-by-step instructions.
2,It wasn't a good book for me,I really tried to like this book but I just could not. Especially for someone who is new to drawing like myself it was a waste of money . This book is more suitable for an experienced artist.
3,Not proffesional tecnicues,"If you want to become a great artist or sell your drawings then dont spend your money. This book is for *light hobbyist*. And always try the ""samples"" before buying any eBook."
2,Validation of medical devices?,"I was looking for more information on medical devices than was provided and greater detail on the statistical methodology used to validate which was especially sketchy, especially at such a steep price."
4,A fun read that doesn't take itself too seriously!,Not going to give a synopsis of the book - already been done plenty. Add me to the people who really enjoyed this unusual mystery in a small town in Iowa. Large doses of white witchcraft give the story a unique twist. Novel doesn't take itself too seriously - just a fun read. I'll be reading more in the series!
3,Witch way to boredom...,"The first book to the Ophelia and Abby series was a let down for me. I found myself struggling to finish reading the book. It didn't actually start getting good till the last few chapters. Once it did get good though i found myself relieved. This book is okay if you like cozy reads, but if you want more excitement i suggest something else."
5,Entertaining read,This is the first in a series by Shirley Damsgaard - I highly recommend this one (and the others as well) especially if you want a good read about witches that are less fantasy than the usual ones out there. The author takes her readers seriously and the plot holds together beautifully with a nice balance of humour and good pace. Well worth the read!
2,A waste of my time,If you are looking for a good mystery with a strong streak of magic in it skip this series and go to either Madalyn Alt's books or Victoria Laurie's two excellent series. The end of this book couldn't come quick enough for me to get away from the whiny main character Ophelia. This paperback is going into the library dropbox anonymously.
2,No Talent,"The title character's name is Ophelia. She's built up walls, doesn't want anyone to know about her ""talent"", and is terrified when a hot salesman takes interest in her. Shirley Damsgaard has found a way to turn a one dimensional character-driven novel into a successful franchise. I don't know how she did it, but it certainly wasn't because of her writing talents.When I read the line, ""Yes, literally saved by the bell."" I literally LOL'd."
1,I can't dislike this book enough.,I read a lot of books. The writing style of this book made my brain hurt and my eyes fuzzy. Don't waste your time.
5,witch way to murder,"This book really reminds me of the TV series, ""Charmed."" If you like the TV show, you'll love this book."
4,Excellent debut novel...,"Love the concept of a psychic librarian with her granny woman Grandma solving mysteries. This debut novel marks the author as someone I will be looking for in the future. I would have given ""Witch Way"" 4.5 stars if I could. Felt like the clues were not as good as they could be--while I did 'suspect' the actual perp, I can't say there was a clue there or I just didn't like the person."
4,Wonderful Witchy Brew,"I really love this book. I haven't finished, but I had to say how enjoyable it is. I have a few more pages. The writing is tight and intelligent. Not too far fetched. The character Rick was at first unbelievable because most women would have taken out a restraining order on him. This is a cozy PLUS. Most intelligent writing in this genre I've read in a while. I'm hooked and will be onboard for More. I have already pre-ordered the next book."
4,A good new author,"I liked this writer's style a lot and her characters were well rounded, if a little cliched. I knew who the bad guys were well before the end but I liked the story and the people enough to read it through and see how it turned out and to be sure I was right. Admittedly the end was a little problematic for me (spoilers, not much of one though) when Ophelia was suddenly so darned gifted. Couldn't she have worked up to it? Heroines who turn out perfect are not my cup of tea.When book 2 comes out I'll definitely be picking it up.Oh, my one big complaint, if Abby is from the Appalacias and trained through a lineage why has she picked up the New Age way of spelling ""magic"" with a ""k"" : magick?"
4,Wonderful Preview of whats to come!!,I really liked the book. Made me laugh out loud at times. Love the Characters.... Ophelia is funny and vunerable. Abby is the Gramma I wished I had. Full of page turning fun and Mystery!!
1,Witch Way to Murder,"I found this book to be annoying. There was too much talk and not enough action. I found myself bored before the first 100 pages. I wish, Ms Damsgaard, much sucess with her series. I just won't be reading any more of them."
5,Let your keyboard do the walking(surfing) through the pges.,"I use the yellow pages in order to find businesses. I use the yellow pages in order to find what is local to me. Since the inception of the internet business or web sites are virtually at your fingertips and the yellow pages can take you there.Literally from A to Z is what you get, in over 800 pages covering just about every category you can think of and then some. Each entry includes the correct URL and a brief description of the Web Site .What you don't get is an electronic version of the book with an ability to update on a regular basis. Like any yellow pages this book is only as accurate as those putting it together and having to buy this book year may not be the value you think it is.At the end of the book is an index that cross references the entire book, overall there are a couple of improvements needed and this book should have parent approved section."
4,If you're not going to dance get you ass of the floor...,"This is it. 99% of the world didn't have a clue who the hell Nirvana was when Bleach came out, but did that deplete the quality of the album? This is a wonderful debut album from a band I'm certain we'll be hearing alot from one day. So get yours before they become trendy."
2,Not impressive roduct,no holes to mount the slide hammer when pulling out.... quality is not so good... Wagner is way better quality.. I will not buy raybestos again...
4,A wonderful read,"A wonderful read, the author's insight that in war, we are not ""killing machines"", but human beings. John Ciardi writes about experiencing fear, loneliness, despair, and hope. His diary is but a small sample of the soldiers and pilots on Saipan who were so close to the Japanese homeland and no end to the war in sight."
1,Waste of Time and Money,Waste of Time and Money. The cartridge's drum constantly left multiple horizontal lines on the page. Do not buy this stuff.
4,"BETTER THAN ROMAN BLOOD, VERY GOOD.","I enjoyed this book very much. Yet I found the main character's way of addressing slavery to be very out of keeping with the time the book was set in. A Roman man would have thought nothing of the slaves' plight, but it is a modern historical fiction piece after all. Worth reading, decent mystery. If not for the Roman setting and historical detail though, I'm not sure anything would stand out about his mysteries."
4,Arms Of Nemesis,"Gordianus is back in Steven Saylor's second book in his Roma Sub Rosa series of Ancient Rome. I found the character Marcus Crassus well pleasing in his no nonsense and heavy handed way that he portarys himself. The other characters are well thouht out to add to the story. I like character Gordianus all the more because of his nature, His adopted son Eco adds to the story by helping his father in his investigation. The story moves very well and keeps you guessing as to how Gordianus will solve the mystery, even the ending has Gordianus thinking he has the answer to the murder."
4,A Slave to Historical Mysteries,"Saylor has a surer footing than he did in his first book, though it's still not a ""tight"" novel. Gordianius plays Batman to Eco's Robin but at a leisurely pace.Saylor is at his best in describing the unforgettable horrors of slavery which underlie the plot. True, it's viewed through 20th/21st century eyes, but we're talking a novel and not a treatise.Saylor's gay message tends to intrude in his novels. His male-male relationships are complex, but each novel has one canned male-female scene repeated virtually verbatim from his first book. Bethesda, though, is a wonderful character.I admire the research put into the books. While the books aren't yet full literary strength compared to Ellis Peters, I suspect Saylor puts in months of research for any given novel.Keep them coming, Steven."
3,Cultural Glance at its Peak,"Gordianus the Finder is hired by the richest man in Rome, Marcus Crassus, to find the murderer of his cousin, Lucius Licinius. Most clues point towards the two runaway slaves. Therefore, Crassus is instituting the ancient Roman law of killing all of the rest of the household slaves. Will Gordianus solve the murder in time?Steven Saylor did an excellent job maintaining historical authenticity throughout his work while still keeping it extremely interesting. The cultural descriptions were flawless while he simultaneously supplied varying points of view from the separate classes of people. The one flaw that I found however was the minimalistic references to the Spartacus rebellion occurring simultaneously."
2,Not all it could be,"The problem with this novel is that the backdrop is more interesting than the foreground. We want to hear more about the Spartacan rebellion, its effects on slaves and how they felt about it, their temptation (to join in) and their fears of doing so. But the slaves in this novel, who are after all are at the heart of plot, are flat -- they are simply the objects that the patricians pretend, in their elaborate make-believe, they are. The result is a narrowly circumscribed who-done-it in a Roman setting (""Colonel Mustard in the Billiards Room with a Knife""), a slight entertainment that begs for more."
4,"Suspenseful, edge of your seat fun!","Ok, I gave it four stars because of some of the adult material in the novel (plus the fact that I'm more of an Agatha Christie/Hercule Poirot person and I'm not really into mystery novels), but above all, it was a good read. I had to read this for my Ancient Roman history class at San Diego State University. The story revolves around a dead government official, Marcus Crassus, and the issue of Roman slavery (apparently, they were no different than the slaveowners in the antebellum South).Enter Gordianus the Finder and his sidekick, Eco, his adopted (and mute) son. The two must solve the case of the murder of the government official before something worse happens. The end of the book will surprise you! If you're looking for a good read, this is it. I stayed up until midnight reading ""Arms of Nemesis."""
3,Second Isn't First,"The second in Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series wasn't what I hoped for, but it wasn't bad. I did like it enough to continue the series and I'm glad I did. Don't give up. Continue on to Cailina's Riddle."
5,All the Colors of the Earth,"This book relays the differences of people in a simplistic way with beautiful artwork. When teaching, this book can be used with different age groups. It can be used as a story-starter for writing with students."
5,Great for affirming the beauty of all children,"I am a first grade teacher and I use this book in my clasroom every year. It celebrates the beauty of all skin colors, hair colors and eye colors. This book teaches children that they are beautiful and that the people around them (even those who look very different from them) are beautiful as well! The small amount of text makes it short and easy to read, so the focus of a child's attention can be on the message of the book."
2,"Outdated, Sappy","I truly hate to go against all the other reviews of this book. I was excited to get it but upon first reading, I felt my insides sinking. First of all, the illustrations are really really outdated and they are, in my opinion, extremely corny. On top of that, I found the prose to be really goofy and unappealing. I felt silly reading them to my three year old daughter, in fact. I'm so sorry to say it but I did not think this book appropriately treated the issue of diversity since it does focus on colors mainly, and the way that it conveys the range of colors is shallow and so overly poetic that it actually is not poetic at all because it turned cliche.I'm going to keep looking for a good book about diversity for children."
5,Delightful,"Teaming Big George with the deft and funny hand of Ms. Manushkin was inspired. For once celeb book that's actually funny and worth a spot on the shelf. Clever, jolly, and something kids actually like!"
4,Really cute!,"I don't have much to add about the book's storyline, but this book really made my 7-year old beginning reader crack up! She read this book from cover to cover several times and was absolutely amused by all the boys named George, as well as their antics - especially the fact that the baby got bathed several times in one day.This was just a really fun read for us.When she brought it home from the school library I was not expecting to be amused, but I absolutely was."
4,You have got to be kidding...right?,"When I first read the title, I thought is was a dating Bible for losers. However, I agree with another reviewer, the title is misleading. It's really about being confident, projecting that confidence and how others perceive you.This book WON'T make anyone fall in love with you. BUT, you can use this book to change how your prospective partners perceive you. Even if you only build close friendships, this book is a good buy."
5,Nice Read!,"This book offers some interesting takes on love, mating and dating. I found many of the concepts refreshing and the book made me contemplate the why's and how's people are attracted to certain people. It is one of my favorites along with the classic Stumbling Naked in the Dark by Bradley Fenton. Enjoy!"
5,I really make a beautiful and gorgeous woman to fall in love with me!!!!,"Actually, I bought this book about eight years ago. The reason why I wrote this review is that it really helps me find my ""true love"" and makes my ""Miss Right"" to fall in love with me.After years of chasing around with girls, I was frustrated because each of the attractive women I like and met didn't like me or would have a long and healthy relationship with me. But, after I read this book and followed the recommendations from the book, it likes a magic... I really make a beautiful and gorgeous woman fall in love with me!!!!Now, I have married with this wonderful woman for eight years. We still love each others so much.Thank you so much, Leil. You have changed my life...and I have a family full of love.P.S. We have two amazing gifts from God.. My son is 6 years old and my little princess is 2 years old now."
5,Great book! It really helps!,"This book is written in a very funny way, and at the same time it presents scientifically-proven techniques to make someone fall in love with you. The four ""eye techniques"" are especially useful, try to learn them by heart. I've learned many small details with this book that are very important when you are flirting."
5,Watch out Dr. Gray,I was thoroughly impressed with this book -- and that is hard to do nowadays. The book gives some excellent tips and suggestions for flirting and getting the attention of someone you are interested in.The RoMANtic's Guide by Michael Webb is a must for all male readers. It gives incredible ideas on romancing your sweetheart. And the ideas don't cost a bundle.
4,This is one of the basics,"If you are looking for this kind of books, I most suppose you need for advise about love and romance (as I did). Well, this one of the books you most read. Lail Lowdes wrote this book aporting two important elements: Scientific information about human interrelations (mainly, the romantic ones) with estadistic facts, and a female point of view about romantic relationships. Everything with an easy reading style. If you want to become a seduction expert or just to find somebody to be with, this is one of the books you most read, but not the only one.Another books you most read at least are: How to succeed with women by Ron Louis (specially for men), The art of seduction By Robert Greene and Body language secrets by Don Steele.Remember the most important; don't give up, trust yourself and you'll get it."
5,Fell in Love with this Book!,"This book was amazing! A guy friend of mine had given me some tips from it years ago and recommended I should read it. I finally got around to buying it a couple of months ago and finally sat down to read it. It offered great tips about communication and gender differences. I often found myself reading the sections geared towards men and thinking ""Yes! That's exactly how I would like a guy to act!"" So I have faith that the sections that are geared towards women are accurate in their suggestions. In fact, I have toyed around with some of the ideas she gives and they honestly worked. I'm sure it isn't the ONLY reason that the guy fell for me, but it certainly helped! I 100% recommend this book for girls AND guys. Even for those of you who are skeptical or not looking for love, it still brings to the table some really interesting sociologial studies and impressive facts! Happy Reading!!"
2,Too many book like this in market for money,"1. firstly, you can't make anyone fall in love with you.2. It's totally not necessary to please anyone like that.3. learn to love yourself, which is the best way that get idea relationship, otherwise you will attract the wrong person.4. Have you heard in many relationships, sex is good, but the relationship is bad? what the author tell us is ""how to get someone in bed"". If you want that, this is good reference.There is big difference between love and sex attraction5. when you attract the one like this, the result is he or she will be smart enough to find that you are lowing yourself to please him/her.( no one is as fool as that). What you get is pity NOT love.There is still some scientific information here, So I give 2 star, maybe can be used as reference for people who understand themselves."
3,Not so flaky...,As you might think. Rather a play it safe or maybe play it real book. Is this a sell out of our dreams? I dunno... Having been in relationships where the balance is grossly unequal and felt the peace of looking at someone I knew was the same as me... Just maybe I agree with the author. An interesting & thought provoking book.
1,"Silly, but entertaining if not taken seriously","While the book is fun, it is important not to take it seriously and have any expectations.To paraphrase Henry Kissinger said to Chairman Mao, when Chairman Mao asked Kissinger (in front of Nixon) how he was able to be involved with so many beautiful women, ""Money and Power are the best aphrodisiacs."""
3,Declawed Speed Seduction,"Many people will dislike this book because it's too manipulative. I disagree - it's not manipulative enough. Although this book increased my seductive character, it presents NLP without ever using the term or mentioning that one can use covert hypnosis language patterns in order to seduce.I would recommend this book, though, to anyone who is having a ""dry spell"" in either sex or love. It breaks down into baby-simple steps how to stop being self-absorbed and how to actually pay attention to other people. Most people, male or female, just want someone who will pay attention to them, take an active interest, and help them know that they actually have some value in the world. This book offers simple tips such as asking a person how they are doing, listening, and then next time you see them ask them about the situation they mentioned rather than just another generic ""how are you doing?"""
5,Great reading!,"After watching people in bars and such for several years, I can honestly say, this books says it all! This book can not only be used in finding your future loved one but also in developing better relationships with those around you. If you can't make a lover, make a friend. This book will help but I don't guarantee it will work absolutely. It is working for me though."
2,Not bad but I've found better books....,"It's not that this book is BAD but it's manipulative as other reviewers have said. I read this along with another book, RECRUITING LOVE: USING THE BUSINESS SKILLS YOU HAVE TO FIND THE LOVE YOU WANT and I think those sisters have a MUCH better idea than this author...there's no POINT in chasing around someone who doesn't want YOU....why bother? It's better to know what you have to offer and what you really want so you can go and GET IT! That's my view anyway."
2,ok,A lot of this book is stuff I have read from other books. It makes falling in love feel like lots of work rather than fun. If this is what falling in love is like no wonder I haven't it is too boaring.
3,Its Okay but has a few flaws...,"There are a lot of generalizations in this book that will not work for everyone. As a male, some of the advice will make you look pathetic. There are some good pointers though."
3,"Intriguing, but ultimately fails on the reality of human relationships.","This book is hilarious, I'll admit it. If you are ever seriously bored and need a couple of good laughs and chuckles, get this book and read the whole thing. I'll admit, some advice in this book is GREAT should you ever want to start a relationship with someone and you want them to feel loved and special so that they'll want to be around you. However, this book also contains nuggets of information that, while it will help you get that man (or woman) to fall for you in the short-term, in the long-term you'll only be living a lie, and that's not a life worth living in my opinion. So take this book with a grain of salt, and if you are serious about following this book for someone in your life that you are in love with, then heed my previous caution and only do it if you truly feel that the person you love is worth all the hard work. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,Dating Techniques,"The author, Leil Lowndes teaches you dating techniques for men and women. What you should and should not do when you are dating. It comes in 3 CDs. Some of the techniques are quite simple to apply."
2,Not for men,"This book is total useless for men. I heave read much more better books. This book is full of fluff talk and it gives you a sense that you are transforming from a men to a girlfriend with a penis. I don't know if it is useful for women , but if you are a man -> find other books"
2,How to con your way into someones heart.,"This book is about using trickery and deceit to get someone into your life. This is not about a healthy relationship between two consenting adults but how to better serve your own self interest by controlling your intended victims reactions and emotions while guarding your own motives. Very predetory in feel. Anyone using these methods will hopefully be spotted, rejected, and resented by the more adult population. In other words, you risk having the methods backfire! I would suggest that anyone who would like to defend themselves against these tactics to read this book out of self preservation."
4,Doesn't Quite Hit the Mark for Me,"Not a bad book but one reservation I have is that it encourages people to act like a 'phony' sometimes. While I can appreciate those kind of tactics in dating, it doesn't appeal to me.I have found from reading books like Regan's ""The Evolution of a Warrior"" that attracting the opposite sex requires both work on your own attitude as well as building an irresistible rapport with the other person. Being a man, I find the best teachers for how to pick up women are those men who have mastered the game - not another woman writing another one of the million ""How to.."" books on this subject."
1,John Deere Remote Control tractor,"This item was the primary request for Santa Claus from my 5 yo grandson. It was delivered Christmas Eve night by Santa and opened with great appreciation from my grandson, early Christmas morning. The battery pack was charged and a little later in the day, we took it outside to play. We found the tractor will only go in circles to the right. The gears in the right front wheels do not engage, it will not go in a straight line. Of course we disposed of the packaging material and did not retain the return information."
3,Depends on what you're looking for...,"The only reason I have a cell phone is for emergencies, and this phone is pretty reliable for that. I'm on a Minute to Minute plan, where you just buy the minutes when you need them. The phone is ok for that type of stuff. But, If you are looking for a plan, and are intending to use the phone very often, I'd go with something else.Remember, you get what you pay for."
3,its just decent.....,"I had no problem with the K10 Royale. My friend has this phone so I always just borrowed it to check out its features and stuff like that. After a while, I noticed some flaws in the phone.The buttons are a little too stubby for me sometimes so if I try to text someone, it can be a little hard *or if I try to surf the web, its hard to type in the URL*F.Y.I., there's no point in surfing the net with the K10 Royale because the screen is so small, so its quite pointless honestly.The color is pretty ""decent"" and every other features that the other Kyocera phones *from virgin mobile* have offered are still there.Again, this phone is just pretty good and decent."
3,"inaccurate, unnecessary phone reviews","first im gonna say that i already reviewed this thing. to look out guy, what is wrong with you man? first, you come on here and write a review that is ridicoulous and has outrageously inaccurate information. you completely dissed a perfectly good company with your little antics on this website. so then a few people come on here and pretty much nicely say that your info is wrong. then what do you do? you go at them and you insult everybody who uses virgin mobile service, saying that we're all childish. dude, just shutup. if you just gonna come on here and diss people and get everybody mad, then you got some serious problems. get off this website and get a life."
4,Uh huh,Only $50 and a Top-Up card? That's like getting this phone for $30 when you think about it and you should; it's a good deal. And you know that with Virgin Mobile you have the freedom from contracts. Buy the minutes you need and that's it. You gotta like that.Compliments of Cathy_luvs_dd a true Virgin Mobile Insider
3,software bugging out after 6 months. sigh.,"I had the K7 ""Rave"" for two years, toward the end there it got buggy on me. I've had a K10 now for about six months, and it's already farking up. Features will randomly freeze, requiring me to take out the battery and power on again to recover from. Sometimes, certain features work, sometimes not.Volume is lousy, you'll be that guy shouting everywhere you go.Display is ""okay"" as in not too dim, but not to easy to read either.I currently have my call alert set to vibrate/ring... sometimes it rings, other times it vibrates, totally randomly. Is that right?Don't even bother trying to browse the web, it's s oos l o w .Virgin Mobile is of average helpfulness. Although my phone's still under warranty, they would charge me to replace it *unless* they found a manufacturing defect. The rep wasn't sure if software counted as a manufacturing defect.Lousy.I DO NOT recommend Kyocera phones.I'm currently looking for a different service provider.Meh."
1,"Horrible, customer service. Not able to get refund.","Ordered 2 phones with 'pay as you go' service.No one was home to accept the package so it was sent back to the local FedEx office.Called FedEx to have the package re-routed since I work during the day. FedEx said a 'Re-route' could only be done by the shipper.Called Virgin Mobile customer service to have the package re-routed. I was rudely informed that it can't be done and was basically told if I didn't like it, I should just return the phones.I refused the delivery from FedEx and was told I would recieve a refund.Months have passed. I've called Virgin Mobile's customer service many times to discuss my refund. I've filed complaints with BBB and FCC.STILL no refund."
1,BIG TIME SCAMERS,"I was lied to by a costumer service rep, and no supervisor would help me!!! I paid 10 dollars for absulutely nothing!!!! I was assured that the 10 dollars would go into my balance, they automaticly took it from me and told me I could change plans and I would still receive this money!! I would not recomened this service for anyone that doesn't want to get screwed!!!!!"
2,KIDS!!! READ THIS ESPECIALLY ADULTS AS WELL,"OK,Kids I am 14, I know it may seem the best in the world to have a cell I know I was there, with Virgin mobile...Honestly they suck, they cost you crazy...Let's just say it is more expensive then a pay phone people! I spent so much money onthis crap and the antenna broke off and all the cheap parts broke and it wasn't worth it... 25 minutes for first 10 mnutes!!! 10 cents after, well if yoy dont use lots of minutes then it really charges you! So yeah there it is I switched to Tmobile prepaid, better phones great stuff...and it is a lil tough to get past symone the automated voice lady!!!!"
4,Cujo Book Review,"This book by Steven King as so far an awesome book it is an exciting non stop thriller, he makes it so you want to put the book down but you can't and what I mean by that is the book is really descriptive and a little on the scary side I wouldn't recomend reading it late at night if you get scared easy but on the other hand you want to keep reading to see what is going to happen. This book is based around a little boy and a saint bernard who is well a man eater. I enjoy Steven Kings books for many reason and this is one of my favorites the book gives so much detail that you feel you could be there, I've seen the movie and I prefer the book it has more detail and makes you think a little about what is going to happen next."
4,Nice,"I like the charm and it got here quickly - shipped out on a Sunday, arrived Wednesday; however, I wish the ad had spelled out that there was no chain with it. I realize the description says ""charm"" but I think it should include a note that the chain does not come with the charm."
4,Unique,"So cute. I ordered this a couple years ago for my best friend. I really liked them because they were unique and dainty. They start to fade after a while because they're just gold plated but still super cute, I still wear mine."
1,What A Waste,"Reading this ""book"" is a painful reminder that of how easy it is to pass yourself off as an ""expert"". How many times have you seen someone on TV say they are an expert in something, solely because they have annointed themselves as such. This is clearly the case here as well. Let's all pay this guy so money, so that he can tell us what we already know!!!Save your $$$"
1,Waste of my money!,"I have worked in the hotel industry for 17 years in the Front Office and Housekeeping. I cannot believe the crock of baloney that this man is dishing out. I have had to deal with ""know-it-alls"" in the travel industry before and that is why I had to read this book. He states to get the best rate is to call the Manager on Duty, Director of Sales or the General Manager. Good luck in finding them! The manager on duty is too busy dealing with all the people that booked cheap rooms but are demanding the Presidential Suite. If you don't pay for it you are not getting it! This man has only added gasoline to the fire. Save your money-Try being nice to the Front Desk person and they will go out of their way for you. Demand the world and get the worst room in the world!"
1,how to exploit others while really trying,"I've never read anything of Mr. Greenberg's before, and I doubt I will again. Everything in here is about how to cheat and chisel for your own gain. The author states that he has one of the biggest collections of hotel toiletries at home and that he's sure everyone takes towels and trinkets from hotels. He obviously hangs out with very different people than I do, because my friends and I consider this sort of thing STEALING. I think it's pretty crappy to ask for a disability-accessible room when you don't need one because they have a bit more space. So, then, if a disabled person comes along, s/he can't stay at that hotel. That's just the epitome of selfishness! I threw this book in the recycling bin rather than pass it along to the thrift shop because I found it so offensive. Strike a blow for human decency - ignore this book!"
2,NOt userfriendly,"If you don't sew too much it's a good little machine, but oh so frustrating to change the bobbin and every time you use the thread cutter the presser foot falls off. If I looked closer on this machine I would never have bought it, I would have made sure the bobbin loads from the top. If you want to put this machine in a sewing table, you have to crawl under the table to change bobbin. To thread a new bobbin you have to rethread...........summary. good for once in a while sewing and mending,priced good,but not user friendly."
5,Alabama,Excellent CD. All the classics that just make you want to smile! It will take you back in time musically. I recieved it in record time as well. Amazon continues to impress me :)
2,Make Mine...something else,"Didnt really like this one too much. Sure, we all knew Gwen was going to die, it was Just a matter of when. Carnage, Much like Venom, was reduced to a much weaker version of his mainstream counterpart. Very Bad move. I do not care for whats implied with this ""Ben Riely"" charecter.. Come on Marvel , just say no to clones."
2,"Sad, Sad, Sad","Not only does Gwen dies in this book, it's just a horrific death. I mean really. Show some class. Not a good book. Bad."
4,Carnage!,"Ultimate spiderman volume 11 is one of the best volumes in the Ultimate Spiderman series. The story line continues from volume 7.Peter Parker is in the battle of his life against a evil killing machine known as Carnage, created from his own blood!I recommend this to any Marvel and Spiderman fan."
4,"""get this book""","i have a felling that the guy who took peters DNA is the one responsible for the clone in the clone saga, Also i think since kitty got mad at peter for talking to marry jane that she is the new ultimate spiderwomen and maybe a clone kidnapped MJ or maybe kitty did it and for all of you who dont have this book get it because Carnage is coming back in the clone saga."
5,You don't have to own WOW Hits 2007 CD to own this!,"This DVD is a companion to the WOW Hits 2007 CD, but whether or not you own it, you'll still like this. Both the CD and DVD have a few of the same songs, and a lot of the same artists, but different songs. There are some artists that are on this DVD that are not on the CD. There's Amy Grant and Kids in the Way to name a couple.The videos are divided into Pop and Rock. You can watch all of the videos, just the Pop videos, or just the rock videos. If you want to select a video, just select the CD cover above the title of the video. When you are finished watching that video, you can just let it play and watch the other videos. Otherwise, you must press either the ""stop"", ""forward"" or the ""menu"" buttons on your DVD player. The DVD does not go back to the menu screen that you selected the video from! (If the WOW people want to improve the DVD, that's the only suggestion I have.)Other than that, this is still a great DVD!"
2,The 87th Shows its Age,"This reprint of the 1972 original features most of the main characters from the 87th Precint. Makes you wonder what age these guys are today if they were mid-30s back then.Some unintentional technological humour from McBain, especially his detailed description of bugging and tracking, but the characters - Kling and Carella in particular - are beginning to take shape. The plot is fairly rudimentary and by employing a simple-to-crack code as one of the keys of the case, much of the suspense is missing from a pretty predictable ending.A quick read, and certainly not a boring one for McBain fanatics - and should be enjoyed for its description of a 1972 lesbian bar as much as anything."
1,Predictable,I think this book was too predictable.I am a member of a cool club.If you are advertising one book's sequel and you haven't read the first one you basically know that the good guys prevail.I am the same kid who wrote the review that the 3rd book didn't have cool stuff.It was pretty neat but I like modern stuff
4,Larry Adler 1930's recordings,"Larry Adler was the first harmonica player to lift the instrument's image up from the ragmuffin/hobo/cowboy stereotype to an instrument capable of performing Classical and Jazz music. These recordings are a sampling of some of his 1930's recordings.Included on this CD are light classics such as the Rhapsody in blue, Rubenstein's Melody in F and the Hungarian Dance No. 5. There are also quite a number of popular selections by songwriters Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Duke Ellington, Cole Porter and more. Adler's version of Ellington's ""Caravan"" features some especially tasty playing.Though not the best sampling of this era in Adler's career, this CD is definitely worth getting."
1,Pure Drivel,"This book is nearly worthless. This is barely poetry, and attempts to label it as such defile the art form. While the suffering that Rollins was experiencing when he wrote these terrible tomes may be legitimate, his ability to express it is sophmoric at best. It's as if he almost tries too hard to capture something and falls flat on his face. The themes of burning and death are so recurrent, the book becomes redundant less than a quarter way through. There are some instances where the writing takes shape, but this is like salt and pepper against a bitter, repugnant main course. While Rollins' music (Black Flag, Rollins Band) seems to have some artistic relevance, this book is a far cry away from anything that deserves to be labeled as ""art."" I've read more impressive passages on stalls of port-o-johns."
4,Very Insightful,Henry Rollins has written 12 books in his life. They seem to be all very good and well written in my eyes. People should take his work for what it is. He is not a god or prophet and at the same time he is not evil. He is just a man who is writing about his personal experiences...that is all. He is writing about what is on his mind. We should all do that.
4,Awesome Patio Speakers,"These speakers are so awesome and cheap, that I bought 2 pair for my patio. Not exactly good for big parties but, just enough for a BBQ or a get together in the backyard."
2,Depends on your expectations,"I guess my sound expectations are greater than the others who reviewed the product. I was expecting much better sound considering the speecifications. The highs and midrange were passable but there was no bottom bass. I hooked them up to my home sound system to check and to my disappointment - Flat. Esthetically they are resonably designed. The construction is white plastic. If you are planning to mount these it looks a little flimsy. Judging from the MSRP I thought the product would be better. Oh well, I will be returning these and continue looking for something better"
4,good product,"Good product, but it takes time whether it can last for a long time under all kinds of whether outdoors."
4,Mr. Critical,I purchased 2 sets (4 speakers) for use near our pool. For the price the speakers sound great and are decent looking. The bracket seems a bit flimsy (it's plastic) however; once mounted with the speakers screwed in they are fine. I'm considering purchasing another pair for inside the garage. I received them quickly and overall I'm surprised and impressed for the price.
4,Great price and performance,"I ordered these and installed them in my garage. I work on alot of projects outside and figured for the price they can't be that bad. Having delt with phoenix Gold car audio many years ago I was surprised to find that these speakers were not up to par as I expected in there design. The sound quality meets my needs but as for their mounting brackets, I expected better. Don't get me wrong they work but limit the degree in how far you can rotate them before they stop.I will tell you that if you mount these in a garage, having worked with audio for more than 20 years they need to be mounted ""firing into the garage"". This means mount them closest to the main roll up garage door with the speaker facing towards the inside of the garage then angle them down towards the ground. This will directly reflect the sound increasing your bass response and sound quality.Overall for the price with the free shipping it was worth it......"
3,"Decent speakers for outdoor use, not high-quality for indoors compared with other speakers.","I got these speakers for free when I bought a Sonos sound system, and I've been more or less satisfied with them, but not overly impressed by any means. I had them in my bedroom for months before trying another pair, and I was shocked how much better the sound was with another (inexpensive) pair of indoor speakers. Also, the metal grate speaker covers collect a lot more duct than most speakers, but they do come off easily for cleaning. If I had more use for them outdoors, I think they would fare much better when compared to other outdoor speakers. So I would recommend them for outdoor speakers, but not so much for indoors."
4,Great sound for a awesome price !!!!,"You can not go wrong with this pair of outdoors speakers. The are cheap and sounds good. they don't deliver much bass and they are a little bulky but they sound perfect. I installed them in my backyard porch to have music while grilling !!:) and they work perfectly great. Great buy for a awesome price tag !!! you can't go wrong with them. if they ever fail, or get damage for the weather outside I will buy me another pair, they just 30 bucks and they are not some ultra expensive Bose (Bose are great speakers and I own 8 of them for my living room system) but for outside I wanted something good enough and also I did not want to pay big bucks for a outdoors speaker that I can not put full volume because somebody will call me the police and if they ever get damage, I will not cry for !! That's why I got this pair. They rock the world with that price tag and the sound they deliver."
4,I want another one,"I can't believe it's out of stock! I love this dish drainer.I've had one for 20 years and it's time to replace it. Please,please, please get it in stock. I've looked everywhere for it."
4,Great Product,"I have been using this drainer for eight years now and I love it. It saves space, looks good and most importantly DRAINS WELL!. I would like another new one, but I can't find one anywhere in stores or online."
5,DAMN DAMN DAMN,"WOW!! Didn't even know you had a new book until I walked into my local Wal-Mart, who never has anything. When I saw Zane is bold letters I knew I had hit the jackpot! YOU DID GIRL!! Thanks soooooo damn much for bringing some excitement in my life. I couldn't put The Hot Box down. I read it in 16 hours. It's that damn good. I couldn't wait to get to the next work, page, paragraph, chapter! I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. For all of those reading this, if you haven't gotten it GET IT NOW!! It is a must have for all ZANIACS!! Our girl has brought drama, suspense, love, confusion-all to this book. Thank you so much Zane once again, for being a beautiful black woman, and giving us some of the greatest books!!!"
4,I read it within one day...,"I enjoyed reading this book. I oftentimes don't have time to read as much as I like between my family life and work. However, this book was so good, I couldn't put it down. I ordered it on kindle and I read it within one day. The only negative aspect I can point out is the way the ""twist"" unfolded. The reactions of some of the characters did not seem real to me. Hence, I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. But that is nothing major to make me not recommend the book for reading."
2,Read better,"Zane has definitely written better works. I normally complete her books in a couple of days. Well, this one took me over three weeks to finish. I'm so glad I checked it out from the library. It would have been a waste of money to actually purchase. To say the least, I'm disappointed with the storyline that seemed to linger on and on. Plus, the writing lacked that of a great writer. Sorry"
2,One woman is lovely; the other is a monster,"I usually like Zane, but her lead character Lydia in this book is too repulsive to care about. Totally self-centered, cruel, thoughtless, with nothing going for her except her great sexual imagination. And yet we're supposed to be rooting for her.The other lead, Malina, is quite cool and also has a lot of good sex. But too much of it is about Lydia. She orders her men around, disses her girlfriends, never thanks anyone for anything.Also get the feeling that, while Zane knows a lot about sex from a woman's point of view, she understands little about male homosexuality or bisexuality, and her descriptions of this culture are way lame.Zane, just because a character is female and hot, that doesn't excuse her hurting everyone around her. Do better next time."
5,She's done it again!,"Zane book is hot! A definate ""must read"". Truly a 'Zaniacs' dream. Keep them coming Zane! We want more!"
2,Just Average,"I was very disappointed with this book. I had to make myself finish it. The ending had a fun twist, but that is about the only positive thing I can say."
3,Stupid amazon....,I've been on pre-order for this book for like 3 yrs and this company is too stupid to cancel it but apparently it'll never be shipped to me either. This is not the right place to talk about this but maybe they'll pay attention.
4,REAL TALK!!!!!,"Omg! I could not put the book down!!! I read during my lunch, underneath the hair dryer(beauty shop)late at night, and early in the morning. And the sex was off the hook.....Real Talk...."
4,Slow start geeat finish,I wouldn't have normally picked this book but purchased it for a book club and I really enjoyed it. The book was slow to start but the more I read the more I it came to life. I would suggest this book for someone else. Just know ahead of time its not your typical Zane book yet still a good read.
4,"Witty, Funny...Zane","She's amazing as usual. The book is funny, the characters are real and relatable. What I love is the is not an all around love story, it's typical ""I'm in a relationship I don't want but I ain't found nothin better yet so what the hell"" relationship. Doesn't put your heads in the clouds, she gets right on your level and the characters reveal real life situations."
3,Not at all the Zane I'm used to...,"I was really excited to read the new Zane book, but I was somewhat disappointed. My favorite books of hers are Nervous and Addicted because I would follow the characters and it provided details in what was going on. This book seemed really rushed and almost like she really was not into writing it. It was okay, but it definitely is not one of her bests. This would be a book I would borrow from a friend, not a purchase."
2,Not What I Thought,This book was not good at all. Not only was it unbelievable but the storyline didn't link the characters together at all. The toggle between characters seemed like two totally different books. I've read all of Zane's books and lately they have gotten so vulgar and tasteless. People having bowel movements `who wants to read about that' or screwing animals' ugggh! I had to skip through a lot of that bull..... Do better and get you mind out the gutter the next time. I'll read you again...but this book...REALLY!!!
3,Am I the Only One?,"Am I the only one who was disappointed with this book by Zane. I use to run to read her stuff. After all the sex chronicles I was so disappointed that she forgot how to write a novel with good sex scenes. For a good read I'm suggesting ""Tha Bottom Line"" by Hope Lynette."
5,great,"i love the book. there wasnt as much sex as you would expect from a zane novel, but it was good nevertheless. great storyline, and teaches a valuable lesson which is never judge a book by its cover."
3,Not Her Best Work....,I usually like Zane. I LOVED Addicted and Shame on it all. But this one I didn't quite enjoy. The sex scenes were nothing compared to the ones in Addicted and Shame on it all. And that twist with Glenn and Phil did not phase me. And the ending was kind of confusing at first because when it first started out they didn't mention who married who but eventually they did. I'm glad Milena didn't marry that no good ex fiance of hers. He was no good from the start and for the life of me I would NEVER marry a professional or ex professional athlete.
1,Ghost writer Zane,"It's obvious to me that Zane, didnot write this one. She seems to have fallen in the same category, as Omar Tyree, E.L. Harris. They are reading, so many up and coming writers, and presenting their stories. She mentioned that her son, is also writing. Something about the Angle of the Dangle. Hope he brings back the Juice."
2,Poor,"If you are looking to read a book about written by obviously a African American woman who is angry with African American men and or the world this is it. It is clear she or someone she knows has been hurt and feel inferior to African American men so much so she had to write this book making them gay week and homeless to the point they needed to be rescued by a African American woman and can't keep their small head in their pants. Then went on to portray two African American where one is clearly a slut and the other was not far behind, showing them as victims; therefore, they have the right to sleep around and cheat on their partner. The African American women ended on a high note where as the African American men ended on a low note. This book was recommended I would not recommend it to any forward thinking woman or man."
5,The Hot Box,Haven't read this yet. Still working on other books I ordered but I knw it's going to be a great read!! Thank you!!
5,Awsome pics,"I bought this for my 10 and 15 year olds, they love it, great pics with great quality printing."
5,good to go,the book was just as advertised. very satisfactory. i am contemplating ordering more of this copy as gifts to others as it has become one of my favorite references to reflect on our place in the universe. images are awesome and thought provoking.
2,"Lots of repetition and superfluous use of ""stories""","I didn't care for this book overall. I found it to say many of the same things over and over, but in different ways, almost as if they were trying to simply fill-up the pages. Ditto for their use of examples of scenarios about some couples. I had to wonder if those stories weren't made up. One or two examples would've been fine, but I really got tired of the ""stories"" about certain couples."
3,Decanter brush good idea but not necessary,"This brush works with my cheap decanter ($19 from Crate and Barrel) which has a wider neck and doesn't break easily. However, I'm not sure if it is really necessary to brush and scrub the decanter with this specialized brush. As long as you rinse out the decanter promptly after each use, there really isn't any residue worth brushing out. What's more important is to have the decanter properly dry out. So, I paid $8.95 for this brush, and I use it, but have a feeling that it doesn't really do much. Maybe it suits obsessive germ phobes."
1,Broke my Riedel decanter first time I used it,"This decanter brush is too thick for decanters like the Riedel type pictured in the photo and packaging. First time I used it, I was barely able to get it past the neck to brush the bottom but it took so much force to get it out, it broke the decanter. Also, the similar-type wine glass is way too big to force into my Spieglau glasses. It sits unused. After what happened to my Riedel decanter, no way I'm using it on my glasses. Nice materials but too thick."
4,good and useful,"I bought this to protect some clothes against moth. I like it, and it seems to work fine. It is extremely easy to use. I put some winter jackets and sweaters inside, and also some cedar balls. The only thing I dislike is that zipper, which is extremely thin and most likely will break sometime."
3,OK - only good for round pipes.,I bought this for in my horse trailer and not thinking that it would matter that the clothes hanger in there is square shaped. The inside plastic supports (which is kind of cheap) are meant for a round pipe. It kind of works but I don't think I will buy more. It would be nice if the zipper opened down and across the top to make it easier to get clothes out. It will serve the purpose OK to keep dust off my show clothes.
4,Jose,"You get what you expect. Easy to install, easy to use, take no room in your closet, well disign and made with good materials."
1,cheap,"I've had this for less than 6 months now and the zipper already broke, had to throw it out. Waste of money."
1,Not happy,It was to difficult to put to gather.Never got it assembled right. With a friend I was able to modified it and used it. Sorry.
5,This garment bag is awesome.,This garment bag is awesome. It is much better than anything I could find in my local stores.
3,"Inexpensive, but not the highest quality","The following pertains to a larger but similar bag, and I suspect this bag has the same vulnerability: ""Heeding the warnings of other reviewers, I handled this carefully, but it still pulled apart a bit at one of the seams. Fortunately, my careful handling meant only a small separation, which I taped up with partial success. Otherwise, it's a good product, heavy material, fits the rod with no problem. It's not quite deep enough (front to back) for the clothes, but it's not serious and this seems to be a standard width."""
5,Clear for storage,"Wash to use and it is clear, so you can see everything inside. Excellent size as well. Used it to store men's shirts and suits."
2,Quality disappointing.,"Have bought multiple PEVA Frameless garment bags by Richards through Amazon. Should have paid more attention to description, thought I was buying the same. This was not the same quality vinyl/plastic. Not PEVA. Their PEVA bags are great."
1,garbage -- zipper doesn't work,You zip up the bag zipper and the zipper just comes open right behind the closer. Zipper can't be fixed by user. Unusable.
4,Just right...,"The item seals up nicely, even at each end (around the hanger rail), for a relatively dust free interior... It's well constructed and I don't anticipate any problems with it. I just wish it were wider to accommodate a few more clothes.!"
5,Suit Bag,"They work great for my purpose, however, I am waiting to see how long they will hold up or last."
3,"Good bag, but slight issue","So this suit bag is nice, a good size, and seems like it will hold up well, but it has one drawback. They holes for the rack bar to go through are small. We have a wooden dowel for the clothing rack & I had to force the bag to fit on this bar. I got it on there (after quite a fight), but the bag cannot slide or move. I use it for traveling with our garments we make for our business, so it stays in one place, but it would of been better if the holes would of accommodated the clothing bar. I think that the metal bars that many closets use would work fine, but if you have a wooden dowel, it may have the same issue I have had."
1,Pam,This item had to be returned because it did not play all the way through. Received another copy and the same thing happened. I guess it is just in the re-recording process. The seller was pleasant to work with and handled the return quickly.
5,"A black movie, not blaxploitation","In an era where a nation blindly follows a drug addict, coward turned president, it's it's easy to see why a movie like ""The Spook"", could never be made today without reverting back to comical minstrel themes. Movies of black content are referred to as blaxploitation mainly because though the faces on camera are black, the people behind the scenes typically weren't. All too often these movies were paraded as black films 9 times out of ten they weren't. Enter R.R.Moore, Melvin Van Peebles, and more importantly Sam Greenlee. They produced movies from a black perspective, which didn't always have a happy, homie, slave type ending. With the budgetary constraints, and restrictions he endured, Greenlee should be proud of his work. The Spook Who Sat By The Door is more relevant today, than ever before. Like Israel, Iraq, and around the world, this movie shows that our stuggle as Blacks in America continues."
3,"not a bad ""stick to the man"" film",Having just watched this film I can see why is caused so much tension when it was released back in 1973. With the underlining message of blacks taking back their place in world by way of the gun you can see why it was pulled from cinema's across the USA. I did enjoy the film even with being a white guy with a mad interest in Blaxploitation movies and Pam Grier !!...but with this being more of a politcial film I didn't enjoy as much as the other Blaxploitation of the same era. But this was and still is a very powerful film...I would put it up in the same class Sweet Sweetbacks Badasssss Song for its place in Black cinema.
4,Don't trust the Government,Excellent movie for its time and even today. The Government is still running games and trying to manipulate the public. Loved the music as well.
4,I bought this book to pass my test and...,"It gave me a great insight of what the job is and powerful tools that I could use as a base for the beginning.I bought this book to present the test, when I finished it I decided to go and buy a second one, it seem for me that it is missing some essential on laws and practical examples that I'd need to pass my exam .And it is however what its missing its complemented with its instructional content."
2,The Special Educator's Survival Guide,"I am currently a special education teacher. I bought this book looking for more strategies to use in a new sped position (resource room). I found this book to be lacking in practical, usable strategies. It basically covered most topics I had already learned in my licensure program. It is very broad and did not help me gain a better perspective of my new role as a special education teacher."
3,add to the collection for the bookshelf,"very interesting, doesnt hold anything back. i found it better to read a case or two at a time and come back whenever the mood hit me. this is a nice conversation piece something that people will certainly ask you about. its out of print by the way. i had it in my cart for a couple of weeks, it sold and the next one i found was about 5 bucks more. small print!!"
5,Smarte Carbs are great,These bars are great!!! I am a diabetic using an insulin pump and rely on Smarte Carb Bars every day. I like the taste plus there is a little chocolate on each bar and net carbs for a diabetic is 8.
5,Nugo Bar Smart Carb Sugar Free,"I received this item very quickly. IT arrived in excellent condition.The flavor for a sugar free item is fantastic. It even has chocolate on it that satisifies you. If you love peanut butter and chocolate, you willlove this..Don't think because its sugar free it doesnt taste very good,because it most certainly does."
4,Not bad for sugarfree,These are more filling than the stadard nugos. They are not as sweet either. I will order them again. For a sugar free carb smart bar they are better than most.
3,Pretty good,Not Bad for sugar free but not as good as other Nugos I like to mix them into my line up of bars but could not just eat these. I like ti cut them up and freeze them. Thaw slightly and they are a good post or pre workout hit whin trying yo reduce sugar intake
5,Well Written and Speaks to the soul.,"The author of this book does a great job of showing her passion for those of us going through this journey of infertility and loss. The book is not only uplifting, but it also gives you a great slew of resources to delve into. I like to buy something that gives you take aways!"
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"This book is awesome!!!!! Jenni is a wonderful writer, and I can't wait for her next book to be published!!!!!"
3,Depends on what you are looking for,"I purchased this book looking for some guidance for coping with the *grief* of infertility. This is my overwhelming emotion as I begin to accept that I won't have a child of my own. In the book, the author shares much of her personal story. She struggled with more anger and envy/jealousy than I ever did. I felt those things in small doses on occasion, but for me it is the grief that I struggle with. While she covers grief, it is not as in depth as I would have liked. Overall this is a well written book, offering solid Christian guidance. I just wasn't what I was looking for."
2,Not helpful to me,"After reading several chapters of this book, I don't think I will read the rest. While I was seeking a book with a spiritual message, this one is too bible-y for me. I felt that much of the author's attitude was ""Well, infertility and child loss is God's path for you, so you just need to suck it up and accept it. If you never have any children, then that is what God wants for you."" I've had friends say that to me as well and it is not helpful at this point in my journey."
3,A lot of heart.... to much emotion!,"I must admit that after reading Hannah's hope I felt hopeless. The stories all scared me! It was so depressing. There is such a little focus on GOD and HIS PLAN and CONTROLL over all things! Books that have really helped me cope with infertiltiy are first and foremost the BIBLE, than Calm my Anxious Heart by Linda Dillow, and Water fromt the Rock by three authors (one is Garrett) Anyway, for all of you who are facing infertilty, remember one thing, SEEK GOD LIKE MAD! BEG him for his comfort and above all his calming touch!!! HE HAS A PLAN FOR YOU! SEEK HIM and his word!"
3,"Good book, but I needed something more","I read this book after suffering an ectopic pregnancy. I needed something to help me cope. I found this book very helpful. It's a pretty easy read, with short chapters. There are some chapters that I wish would have been more in depth. It also seemed like, at times, the focus was on those who are having trouble conceiving, while I was searching for a book to help me deal with my loss (so I am also going to read ""Grieving the Child I Never Knew"". Overall I think it is a good book & worth reading."
5,God's Grace,This book was literally a God sent to me when I discovered we were going through secondary infertility. I cannot find the words to fully express how much I would recommend this book!
5,A must read!,"I have read many, many books on infertility from both the Christian and secular perspectives. This book was by far the best one I have read. I went through it very slowly as I found it very emotional and treated it as a study. It really helped me to sort out and work through my feelings. You will not regret reading this incredible book!"
2,Fits one hand.,"I will write this review from the perspective of my left and right hands...right: fits like a ..... glove? does not interfere with movement of digits. Keeps my grip when i am sweaty. My thumb is 7cm (about 2.75in) around and it fits tightly in this SMALL glove.left: I cant breathe! everything else fits except for my thumb! My thumb is the same size (7cm around) as my right but it doesnt fit! Why does right hand get everything?Conclusion:For the small glove you will have a hard time fitting if your thumb is bigger than 7cm around. My left glove was smaller than the right.On a side note i tried the right gloves on my left hand by turning it inside out (to see if i had some mutant left thumb), and the right glove fits well on my left."
1,not worth the money,"Please do not waste your money on this video. It contains little information, its mostly footage of bob and guests catching big pike on canadian waters. If you want to learn how to catch big pike, anywhere. Get Will Ryan's ""Northern pike"" book and read it cover to cover, you can't go wrong."
2,Something's missing; too muc monkey business too many tracks,"On the 'Star-Club (Germany) Mercury vinyl Lp there are only 9 tracks. ""Do The Weston"" is still listed on many CDs, but after ovr 40 some ears of YrdbiRds, Do The Weston seems imossible to find. Do The Weston ends Side 1 ofthe Mercury (U.S.) LP. The track is listed on the back sleeve of the Japan Victor CD, but is not in the tracks-listings CD insert. The track eems lost.2-star rating due to unuthentic CD tracks, much of the above tracks are original YardbiRds racks; not all include Sonny Boy Williamson. Many tracks are unrelated YardbiRds releases."
5,Great sonics and orchestral virtuosity.,"Respighi's Roman trilogy receives an excellent reading from the BSO and Ozawa. The sound is thrilling, and the players don't hold back in their virtuosity. The brass sound is round, well-balanced and extremely powerful when needed. The woodwind solos are top-notch, and include perhaps the finest English horn solo in Pines I've heard. I know what I want when I hear these pieces: virtuosity, sonics and visceral excitement. All who contributed to this disc provide just that."
3,"Good, not great.","Marc and Dave's return is a decent one but with Ball's modernization with electronics;it's just not the same cup of tea.This is nowhwere near as brilliant as Torment and Toreros by the Mambas or This last night in Sodom. The songs here show a more realistic point of view by 40-ish musicians and such issues. The opening track, ""Darker Times"" is a stunner though. Other tracks like ""Desperate"" and ""Together Alone"" show the diversity musically on this disc.The other tracks are alright except for ""Sensation Nation"" which is beyond bad. Marc Almond is a largely underappreciated artist in the world and even a good (not brilliant) album like this is better than most's work. To have his voice with us on anything is a joy.This album makes me long for some of the fire and beauty of Violent Silence and Vermine in Ermine from his solo cannon."
1,I can't believe anyone could give this a good review!,"This has to be one of the most disappointing cd's I've ever bought. I wasn't too surprised, however, what with the horrible stuff Almond's been putting out for the last few years. It's a shame that the people responsible for ""This Last Night In Sodom"" & ""Mother Fist"" and the other sublime albums would put out such dreck now.The ""Monoculture"" video was horrendous, one of the worst EVER!"
4,Harrowing,"This harrowing book recounts the stories of individual Kuwaitis who suffered horribly in the days just after the Iraqi invasion in 1990. The focus on individuals makes the book all the more moving; the author's knowledge of and sympathy for the subject country comes through clearly. One can't knock the stories of the Kuwaitis; I was a little disappointed in the author (mention is made of the Kuwaiti government's lack of democracy, which she rationalizes by resorting to the old ""a nation's internal policies are no one else's business"" excuse, also used by none other than Saddam Hussein). For this, I was forced to deduct a star from the rating."
3,Interesting but biased,"Interesting, but also fairly biased and emotional account on Iraqi's occupation of Kuwait. For a more balance perspective check this out: http://www.amazon.com/Stories-Democracy-Politics-Society-Contemporary/dp/0231114893"
2,An Anti- Israeli Israeli journalist,Hass is a journalist for the leading Israeli daily 'Haaretz'. She has devoted her career to not simply reporting on the Palestinians but promoting their cause. In the course of this she has often turned into a propagandist who has lost all journalistic objectivity. Her works feature prominently on sites calling for Israel's destruction.Her total lack of sympathy for victims of Palestinian terrorism is another major feature of her writing.
2,useless for newer TV,"These speakers are absolutely useless for a newer tv, No way of connecting them to a digital audio out on most hi-def tv,s. Did,nt pay much, did,nt get much, oh and benwins website is even more useless. Click a link and all you get is ""Oops"".So much for support."
2,crud,"Not only after purchasing this and another frontpage book and toying with the program, have I discovered, not to go with frontpage at all, rather use Dreamweaver for webpage design. If you still wish to use frontpage DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ONE!! I went through 5 frontpage manuals, and out of the five this was the worst!!"
3,Misses the mark by thiiis much.,"I thoroughly enjoyed Breath and Bones, for the most part. The 'heroine' was lovable even through her misadventures, and even the sections on other characters' experiences were interesting. The ending, though, didn't really ring true to the story or to the main character. The writing was beautiful from cover to cover, but the ending felt hurried and wrong. It felt profoundly unworthy of Famke after all of her travels, troubles, and searching. The character deserved a more heartfelt tie-up."
2,Maundering Journey,"Not written as well as I like. Cokal should have restrained herself a bit, instead of indulging herself and sending the protagonist on many ridiculous, not to mention fanciful, journeys. A failed picaresque novel indeed. Got so tired of the outlandished plot of the novel that I stopped reading--which is very unusual for me. I would not recommend this book."
1,Poor Quality,These glasses lasted about a week. On removing them the frame broke. They were not treated roughly and appear to be poorly constructed. I used super glue to rejoin the top of the frame to hold the lense - it was this solution or send them back to get a refund - so far they have held together under very limited use.
1,Smoke is a very poor description for these sunglasses.,"These seem to be nice and reasonably high quality for cheap sunglasses, the one star is because they are misrepresented as mildly tinted safety glasses. The polycarbonate lenses probably do qualify these for being safety glasses but the dark tint makes them bright daylight sunglasses only. They are way too dark for any safe indoor use and nothing in the product desciption warns you of this.BEWARE, If you want 'outside only' safety glasses these are a good choice. If you want something that can be comfortable inside as well as out, these are not for you. Who would ever expect 'smoke' to be at or less than 25%??? They are going back because they are not properly described and are useless (for me)."
1,Do not fit well,"I thought these would be great, but they do not fit the face very well. I would recommend trying them on somewhere before buying online."
4,Great product,"I was going to get a wired headset, but I got a good deal on this wireless bluetooth headset from the Verizon store. If it cost more than it did, it might have received a lower review. I am on the Verizon Merits program, so I get a discount on accessories, so the headset only cost about $50 (since it was also on clearance).The sound quality is pretty good. Probably not the best, but it's fine. It's really handy to be able to listen to music and not have to look for the phone when a call comes in. This one device does it all.I like how it's designed where the cord acts as a neckband.... Really comfortable.I wouldn't pay $100 for it though. For $100, there are probably better headsets out there. Also, I wish it would show the current song on the LCD. I'm not sure if this is a limitation with the Bluetooth A2DP protcol, my phone, or the headset.Anyways, if you can get a good price on this headset, I'd say to pick it up. It works well and does what it says it should."
1,Looks can be deceptive,"Looks good, matches with my VX8600 perfectly, even the charger is interchangeable.Major gripes..sound quality: ridiculous for a >$100 ear phone. my $10 ear buds sounds WAY better. There is also a very annoying high pitched constant sound that's very noticeable when music is low.Fit: These don't match my ears at all, keeps falling off when I walk. They're also not comfortable, hurts my ears after 30 minutes of usage."
3,A few kinks to work out...,"The headset itself looks very nice and the LCD is a plus, but there are a couple of things that need to be improved:1) The power button. The headset does not turn on consistently and it usually will not power up until the third or fourth attempt regardless of how long I hold down the button.2) Sound quality. There is a noticeable lack of low frequency sounds when listening to MP3s. The higher sounds are crisp and clear, however.Overall I like the headset, but then again I have a feeling that those of you that pay more than $70 for it won't be as forgiving."
1,Don't even waste your money on this.,"I bought this product earlier last year, and after having it for 1 month and 4 days one of the earbuds stoped working. I called LG to see if they could fix it and their answer was: ""WE DON'T DO REPAIRS ON THIS PRODUCT"". Yes, the volume in it is very low. Another problem I found about it is that it has way too much wire for my taste. You are better off keeping the earbuds that come with the music essential kit. I now know why this product wasn't popular at all. Now it's being retailed for $79.99 on Verizon. Being that it used to be $129.99 If you want an exceptionally good bluetooth headset, look at the new JABRA JBT8010Z which has an excellent sound and many more options. It can be purchased with a seperate ear bud for the whole stereo experience. I have it and I love it! Calls and music are crystal clear."
1,In the time remaining you may check your answers,"I am very disappointed with the sample problems and exercises in this review manual. While the simple solutions are explained in insulting depth, the tougher questions are hardly explained at all - almost as if the editor was gesticulating ""let's just forget about this one and move on."" In working example questions, only after checking equations in other sources did I finally determine that this book was in error. What clinched it for me was finding that the answer listed for question 71 of the sample exam is (E) - The choices are (A) thru (D)! Do not waste time or money on this review material."
2,EIT Prep,"Thorough review, but topics do not always follow in logical progression -- chemistry and thermo chapters could be ordered better. Errors in the review questions are really frustrating. I wasted lots of time trying to find how I lost a decimal place, only to find the author did instead. Area and volume terms get mixed in the fluids section. etc"
3,Not the most useful,"One excellent feature of this edition: diagrams of complicated periods (long Ciceronian sentences).Otherwise, not the most useful. E.g., the vocabulary section gives all possible meanings of a word, which anybody can get from William Whitaker's WORDs. I prefer the approach of Walter Englert inCicero: Pro Caelio, which is more specific."
5,ambiance: spacy good overall!,Ambiance:spacy good overall. Salome is very nice but not placed right on this recording. This record makes you long for more. I can recommand this to everyone.
1,Disappointed,"Hmmm - there isn't much about this book I'd be able to recommend. I'm a professional 3D artist and this book is a joke. The techniques given are so simplistic, that they are laughable. The accuracy of the information is very poor and the methods shown are often the worst possible way to create 3D objects efficently. The historical accuracy is is questionable, as is the general information. ""Hey Shamms, porcupines can't throw their quills (pg.26)... check ANY book on mammals!""Save your money. Morgan Kaufmann has a reputation for publishing good books, but this one definitely lowers their curve."
1,minus 10000000000000000 stars,"The book is so bad don't bother. The publisher and the author should be ashamed of themselves. No joke this is one of if not thee worst 3d book ever. this Guy Samms is really clueless and as go through the book you relaize he is just pulling info out of his... and doesn't check if it is even right. I strongly recommand you pass this book up in fact any book written by this... and watch out for this publisher as well, cause if the let this pass through the cracks they just don't care.STINKY!"
3,Nope,"""Let's Get It Started"" is a cool dance song with a great beat. Yes, it is true that there is bad language in it, but I THINK you can buy the unexplicit version.""Let's Get Retarded""? That sounds like a song MAKING FUN of ""Let's Get It Started""! I've heard both, and that's definately what it sounds like. Why would Black-Eyed Peas make a joke of themselves like that?Anyway, I'm personally not a huge Black-Eyed Peas fan. They cuss, and I don't like to have to worry what they're going to say when my parents are around."
1,Disappointed,"My children really like Let's Get It Started, and the radio versions I've heard they use no profanity. I purchased the Elephunk CD, there is a lot of profanity on that CD, but there is no warning label. There are some of us out here who would like to be warned. Major disappointment. The Peas seem talented enough to make the music without the profane lyrics. You can keep it real and keep it clean at the same time. Not asking for role models, just asking for good music."
3,....Lets Get It Started.....NOT!,"Its an Alright Song, but in the song all they do is sing *LETS GET IT STARTED* Over And Over So,Overall,This song pretty much sucks, The Beat Is Catchy,VERY Catchy,I might be Wrong because this is my first review."
1,Explicit lyrics....no edited virson available,"Though, I love the beat and style of B.E.P, I was really disappointed with bad explicit lyrics. Nothing like it's played on the radio. Problem is, you can't find any ""radio"" versions.Be sure to listen to it before buying it for you kids."
2,"Just because someone is ""ok"" with it, doesn't make it ""ok""","""Cursing"" is wrong weather you think it is ok or not. Just because societies sway like the waves on right and wrong doesn't mean that right and wrong don't exist - for all peoples for all history. How then is right and wrong established...maybe the following will help:=======Ephesians 4:2929Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.=======Hard to image what our world would be like if we would listen to the God who created us and loves us like a perfect father, giving us advice to make it a better place.BEP, Rap, Hip-Hop, society - lets start lifting up instead of tearing down."
5,Works with other camera's,I bought this item in order to get more use from my SD card's. I've used this in my Canon Powershot S1 IS and it works great. I'm sure it will work in other Compact Flash device's too. But I recommend getting a real good SD card that can work fast too. Faster cards mean faster pictures and faster downloads. It would be a wise purchase.2 years later (2006).... still a great product!!
3,Inexpensive for a reason,"Great album, and I love Sunny Murray, but track 3 is really marred by audible clicks and pops (there's an obvious scratch in the LP from which the MP3 was ripped). You'll probably fare better with the CD (Sunshine / Even Break: Never Give a Sucker)."
2,Spoon rest,"It arrived well packaged and in a timely manner but I was disappointed in the quality since the wording on the spoonrest is crooked and the sample picture depicts the label boarder as cobalt blue, which is my kitchen accent color, but it arrived with a black boarder. Also it's on the small side for use with cooking utensils."
3,Picture???,especially with this kinda thing they should put a PICTURE here! But it still sounds cool.
1,Lens didn't fit correctly (Like promised),"Service was good, quality was ok, but my lenses that I recieved did not fit. I am currently wasting my time sending these lenses back and getting replacements that i'm not even sure will work. No packaging slip was sent to me, so now I have to pay for shipping on a product that didn't work, like promised, twice."
2,Not a good recording IMHO,"Handel fans may be happy with the Water Music Suite, Royal Fireworks Music, and Music for Ancient Instruments, but the actual recording is not crisp and clear. I tried it in both my regular audio CD player and in my computer. No difference in my listening as far as sound quality. The playing is okay but not spectacular either though I thought the ancient instruments were well done."
4,"This is a very good DVD. If you are a Dr. Who fan, this shoud be added to your collection..","The Doctor and his companion go to a house in England made to look like a house in Egypt to invesate a Temprol Rift. After a time they discover things that happen are controlled from Mars - where an evil god has been imprisdonded by the rest of the gods. This evil god needs help from others to get out of his imprinsmont on Mars. This includes three robots made up to look like mummies. If you are a Dr. Who fan, this one is a ""Must Have"" for your DVD collection."
5,Doctor Who Pyramids of Mars,One of TOM BAKER's best with a solid and intence story that can keep one trying to think of ways to help the Doctor.
5,Dr. Who - Tom Baker Review,"I loved all the old BBC sci-fi series such as Dr. Who! Tom Baker was my favorite actor in the title role. Nickelodeon and/or PBS used to re-run the episodes in the late 70s and early 80s. I grew up with this show back then. The special effects, sets and story lines were over the top and yet at the same time, classic in every respect. This was a time when TV and more specifically had actors that could act! These shows had plots, character development and just plain old imagination for great sci-fi concepts. Dr. Who is a British sc-fi classic! I will always love this series. Buy this episode. It was great!"
5,Abase yourself you groveling ant!,"I wouldn't describe myself as a diehard Whovian, but I do enjoy the show. Pyramids of Mars has to be my favorite. In fact, I think it's just about every Doctor Who fan's favorite. Enjoy!"
1,Great DVD - No Sound!,I have purchased this DVD twice in the past few years. Neither DVD plays any sound. It would be nice if BBC checked the quality of the things it sells. I don't recommend buying this DVD. Amazon needs to remove this product from its catalog.
5,Odd Nerdrum is a man.,"""On Kitsch"", is a seashell when held to the ear revels romantic insights of this twentieth century painter, Odd Nerdrum. The Norwegian painter's masterful and detailed view of the modern art world is only surpassed by the crafstmanship he performs with his eyes and hands. Through interviews, speeches, critiques, drama and humor he explains why he is NOT an artist and insists that the avant garde was right in casting him out of the modernist's scene. Odd Nerdrum's battle for sensuality and longing for eternity pitted him against the Goliath that we knew as modernism; Odd Nerdrum is still alive, modernism is dead. Long live, ""On Kitsch""!"
3,I just wish there hadn't been so many characters...,"I am almost at a loss as to how to rate this book. A big part of me wants to say four stars, because the author made a lot of good points and much of the writing was beautiful, even poetic. But as a whole the story left me feeling a bit...empty. I didn't find myself caring for many of the main characters, except for the African priest named Pius. In a novel full of shallow and sometimes meaningless people, he was a breath of fresh air. I suppose 3.5 out of 5 stars is the most accurate rating I can give."
1,"If you like Agatha and Jane Austen, don't waste your time here","One of the bad apples in British programming that I encounter sometimes when I buy something I haven't seen... like ""Portrait of a Marriage"" as one other example..."
3,Decent job,"Ok book containing some good quotes although not as comprehensive as i would have liked...however, still a good buy for the money."
4,A Diamond in the Rough,"A gripping and deeply moving story, though written in a slightly disjointed manner, the flashbacks to Vietnam add to both the impact and to the difficulty of following the story line.The depth of antagonism stirred by a one-word prayer stretches credibility in a society most clearly marked by apathy, yet the logical progression of that antagonism where everything BUT a committed life based on the politically incorrect person and teaching of Jesus Christ is tolerated - is brilliantly explored.A book with significant weaknesses, this is still a work that outranks many best-sellers in both the mainstream and the Christian marketplace. Containing romance, but not driven by romance, it deserves a thoughtful reading for the clear message of wholesome morality and even more for what it says about the erosion of genuine freedom. It proves as applicable and timely north of the Canada/U.S. border as south of it and is still surprisingly relevant nine years after publication."
2,If things are too quiet you fall asleep.,"When I first glanced at this book, I thought it would be an entertaining and thought-provoking read. I was wrong. The book masks itself as a novel dealing with the issue of prayer in public places. However, it's really nothing more than a love story. The book is rather easy to read, but is also extremely boring. However, it doesn't start out that way. The first few chapters are quite exciting, beginning when teacher Robert Farr inadvertently says the word ""Amen"" at the end of a moment of silence. What starts out as a fight against a hard-hearted principal ends up leading to a battle against the United States government. But, that's just the fringe to a budding romance between Farr and a younger teacher at his school. So much promise, but no deliverance."
4,Pfaltzgraff Heritage white mugs,"I've been looking for some nice white mugs that are NOT supersized! By this I mean they hold a generous cup of coffee but definitely not two or three cups. This 4 1/8 inch mug is attractive, the handle is just the right size, it is well balanced so it does not knock over easily. Although I'd like it to be a bit heavier it is definitely not too fragile. I've been using them daily for over a month now, and I am happy with this purchase."
4,Next best thing to living in France to learn French,"I just installed the French translator from the software to my ipaq 3955, using a 128 MB Secure Ditital card on the back.Installation was very smooth and easy.The vocal translation quality is so good that the native French would have no problem understanding at all. Now you can easily communicate with the French who refuse to speak English.The beauty of the software is that you can actually hear the words that you otherwise would be unsure of their pronunciations.I cannot imagine a better way to sharpen your language skill than this, barring actually going to France for a long time."
3,not impressed,"I ordered this pump to replace a similar pump that was running the filter to a large, 3000 gallon homemade tank system. I needed the pump fast because our back-up filter was pretty weak, but the filter did not come with necessary fitting to attach to attach to pvc coupling. By the time I found one with the correct threads (a guy from our local plumbing store stole one from one of his pumps) the tank had run on the weak filter for a few weeks and the whole system suffered.However, once connected the pump worked fine for the remaining month I needed it."
2,Dissapointing performance,"I had heard good things about Hitachi so I bought a few of these narrow crown staplers for my cabinet company. Even with the depth set at it's maximum, and a line pressure of 120 psi, I have had many problems with the guns not setting the staples deep enough. I am dissapointed and wish I hadn't bought them."
2,the little stapler that should,This nailer should come with a nailset included as a kit. I can never shoot more than 4 staples before one needs to be set. The reason i bought this stapler was because the price at amazon was under 50 dollars.
1,Hmmmm...,"I am usually a very satisfied person, but these speakers didn't make the cut. I should have listened to what others have said about these speakers. They really are junk, and I finally threw them out the other day and replaced them with a nice set I got at Sears. Anyway, the worst part is that the volume cuts out when you turn it down a little ways and they sound terrible! It is either too loud or you get no sound at all. I feel bad for my computer-the speakers weren't worthy!"
3,Guide book.,"This book is short but does give the reader the information on various civil war sites in Virginia. However, the reader will not find any in depth information concerning particular sites."
4,devotion,"i thought this book finally gave Contanze the credit she so deserved. Without her diligance and Nissen(her second husband), Most of Mozart's glorius music might have been lost. Everybody should read this book and forget the bad story in Amadeus, although the music was great."
4,"Desperado Pikachu? Ooh, it only gets better from here!","So you're into Pokemon? You're REALLY into pokemon, right? If so this is THE book for you! Not only is the story practically ripped straight from the game, but it's also got those little touches to make it completely unique and original. Mato's art is almost completely in the SD (super-deformed) style and the way he/she depicts the pokemon is incredible! I love how Pikachu and Bulbasaur are drawn in this manga! Whil I followed the comic from the start, this is really a great place to pick it up! This collects all of part one (if i'm not mistaken) and will lead you into the recently published (and cheaper!) part two! Trust me, after these first stories the comic really picks up and moves at a great pace! This would be a perfect addition to any Pokemaniac's giant collection! It features an awesome story, incredible charcters, wonderful art, and it's one of those rare mangas that's appropriate for anybody! Check this out today!"
3,Performance is wildly different between my cars,"One of my cars has an antenna built into the windshield and this unit works great, albeit a little muffled due to the fact that it's not directly wired to the car's stereo (typical of all of these FM transmitter type of units). I'd give it 4 stars on the first car.My other car has an antenna that raises and lowers at the back of the car near my trunk. The unit won't work at all inside the car. However, if I hold the iPod with the unit installed and on outside the driver's window, it picks it up well. On the back window ledge it also works well, but I can't get to it from back there and it slides around, so that doesn't work for me. I'd give it 1 star on the second car with the ""traditional"" rod antenna at the back of the car.Your mileage may vary, but the closer this unit is to the antenna with no metal obstructions, the better it works."
2,Awful,"I picked one of these up from the Apple store and used it that day. Not only does the product not broadcast well (I had to hold it two feet from my radio, it didn't even get a signal in the car on any frequency) but it dosent stay in the dock connector. The transmitter actually will not lock into the bottom of the iPod. The transmitter also appears to turn off after 5 seconds of not touching the buttons. The LCD screen turns off so you cannot see the frequency it is transmitting on. Because it worked so poorly I couldn't tell if it was broadcasting or if it was simply broken. An indicator saying whether the transmitter was on or off would be helpful and not a huge battery drain.If you want a knockoff transmitter that works only when placed perfectly next to your radio than get this. If you want something that works consider the iTrip by Griffin."
3,"It Gets the job done, But...no one mentions this...","I needed something to use at work because I was tired of buying AAA batteries for the Belkin transmitter gadget.The reviews say minimal battery drainage. Without using a charging device my ipod classic lasted about 7 hours.Charging devices are cheap so I'll need to buy one.Otherwise, the XtremeMac Airplay2 works great for me."
3,Just eh,"Initially, Airplay was one of my best ipod accessory purchases. It came with a slip of instructions what wasn't too bad to set-up and I was able to listen to my ipod tunes all over the city. It did zap ipod power, but that was an easy fix since you can plug in a charger at the bottom. Since my initial review...I've become less of a fan and here is why: It wasn't something that I used constantly and when I tried to program it again in a different city without instructions, it was hard frustrating to figure out how it worked. Also, since I've now done a long distance drive (5 hours) I did notice the static issues that others mentioned. It works just fine locally."
1,a DON'T buy!,"As a drummer i looked for quality in this product and did not find it. The sound quality is good but its nowhere near the sound of an actual drum. I bought this so i could practice without waking the neighborhood but found that this product probably helped them and me sleep, BORING! If your a insomniac this is for you!!"
5,I LIKE IT!,"Well when i first seen the DD55 i walked away from it because it was so small.When i was looking around the store for another product to check out.Thats when i heard this great awesome stereo drumming sound.I brought one for a practice pad.Don""t let the looks fool you.The DD55 rocks."
5,Glad I gave it a try!,"I once believed that any Black Sabbath that did not include Ozzy was not truely Black Sabbath, or worth while. Then I gave the Dio era a try and enjoyed the hell out of it. Later, I gave Tony Martin a listen and I really enjoyed his contribution as well. Headless Cross is my favorite from the Tony Martin era. However, I really enjoy The Eternal Idol, Tyr and Cross Purposes as well. I encourage any Sabbath fan to at least give Sabbath's post-Ozzy/Dio offerings a try. Headless Cross is a great place to start. Enjoy!"
4,Very strong album by Iommi and co,"I've had this album for a number of years and, in spite of what some of the reviewers below me say, its a fine album throughout and one which Iommi is justifiably proud of. Tony Martin has a fabulous voice (still does, in fact), and each of the songs has a typical catchy riff (Iommi is, after all, the king of the riff!). Best tracks are ""When Death Calls"", ""Black Moon"" (very Coverdale-like vocals by Martin on this one) and ""Nightwing"". I liked all of the Martin-era Sabbath material, and this, along with the Eternal Idol, is the best of that period."
4,Solid.,"This disc is definitely not a five, though its a finely crafted album nonetheless. Any release which brought Sabbath back into popularity has to be acknowledged as a successful effort.While catchy, the tone here is sometimes too simple and uninspired (eg. 'Kill in the spirit world' and 'Black Moon'). The title track, the album's single, is appealing at first but ultimately becomes standard Martin fare. Similarly, the lyrics could be a bit more subtle on a number of tracks.In any event, some of Sabbath's strongest work graces the disc including 'Devil & daughter' and 'When death calls'. Iommi's work is sometimes eerie, often heavy, and almost always memorable."
5,Metal Magic,This is getting almost impossible to find. The BEST Black Sabbath recording EVER! Buy 2 so when you wear the first one out you will still have a primo one left. This IS for serious metal fans and headbangers.
5,Tony Martin wails on this one,"I didnt discover Martin-era Sabbath until the era was over unfortunately. I bought this one, Tyr, and Cross Purposes, the great Eternal Idol, and Id rather forget Forbidden. This Headless Cross is every bit as good as Tyr. Martin is a powerful singer and sounds barely contained in most of the songs on this disc. The low end is very there, and Iommi is in all his glory as always. Standout tracks are: When Death Calls (a haunting, chilling heavy tune that will keep you up at night), Kill in the Spirit World (when one spirit murders another - yeah its deep), Bad Moon Rising, Call of the Wild, Devil and Daughter, Nightwing. Did I mention that Tony Martin kicks ass on this disc? I love Dio, RIP, but Martin proves hes worthy of carrying the greatest metal band in the world.....ever."
2,"Sorry, but this sounds much more like Dokken than Sabbath-","-and those keyboards? No thanks. I would recommend this more to a Dokken or Whitesnake fan, than a fan of vintage Black Sabbath."
3,I think Iommi forgot what band he was in.,"I bought this CD solely because of the good reviews at this site. I had not heard any tracks. Well, as soon as I listened to the CD, I got the feeling that Tony Iommi was trying to sound like Def Leppard. I cite ""Kill in the Spirit World"" and ""Call of the Wild"" as blatant examples. They do not sound like what they are about. It just doesn't make any sense. What's with all the cheesy keyboards? Then there is ""Nightwing"" which is just stupid. What the Hell is a Nightwing? At least the CD had some high points. The song ""Headless Cross"" has a way cool intro (can you say Van Halen?), and then there is ""When Death Calls"". That song is the one song with a really Black Sabbath riff. One note about that song: Halfway through, Iommi cuts into this Randy Rhoads thing, I'm not sure why. And that's all I have to say. If you like Sabbath that isn't Sabbath, get this CD. Otherwise, buy Dehumanizer."
3,Whatever,"Yeah, yeah. If you like the heavy metal ... I guess you'll like this album. But I'm like, ""what is this""? I mean, I like the beat... dum dadda dum dadda dum ... and all that but C'MAN! Rn't the 80's ovr with? 70's or whatever?"
3,Whatever,"Yeah, yeah. If you like the heavy metal ... I guess you'll like this album. But I'm like, ""what is this""? I mean, I like it's got a good beat ... and all that but C'MAN! Rn't the 80's ovr with? 70's or whatever?"
5,"Good quality, great price!",This chess set is beautiful and compact. I didn't expect it to be so nice since it was priced so low. It was a nice surprise.
3,"Great movie, poor quality","This is, by far, the best movie version of Great Expectations. It follows the book closely and the acting and character portrayal are superb. The problem is that it is VHS and we could barely make out the dialogue. I am anxiously waiting for it to come on DVD."
5,Disney's Best!!!,"This movie is without a doubt a classic without equal. Disney has taken a subject that by todays standards is considered campy and would be the subject of a horror movie, and Disney made it truly entertaining. This movie is definately worth a re-release, great entertainment for all ages."
4,Quite possibly the best Disney film ever!!,"In my experience, a mark of a fun film, is how often lines are quoted from it! This film keeps my family going for quite a while. I want to show it to my children as I feel it is Classic Disney!"
1,Quality issues,The VHS tape was new but the color quality is very poor. I do not recommend this product based upon my experience.
5,Great Teaching Help,"As a freshman English teacher, I was looking for a teaching tool to help make Great Expectations become ""real"" to my students. This film was a great tool because it followed the novel so closely. We were able to read a block of chapters, complete study questions on that block, and finally watch the film version of those chapters come alive on screen. The fidelity with which the cast and crew deliver this Dickens classic are more than commendable. 5 stars from a very grateful teacher."
2,overated,charles dickens wrote this so called classic.its long boring and stupid!theres this kid who cuts a escaped prisoners shackles off and many years later he repays the favor.and theres an entire unrelated story in the middle.you could let your kids watch it if they need to go to sleep.theres many versions.they all suck.old people seem to like it.no chicks!its consistent with the book.the important message is be nice to people and theyll repay.stuff doesnt work like that in real life though.this movie is no good.
3,Pump discharge/outlet connection is important!,"It's an exact replacement with exception of that the pump discharge is vertical. My pool set-up requires it to be at a 90 degree discharge in order unit's connection to filter canister.I was told that it could be changed and was warned of being carefull not to damage seals and that it should be done by a certified installer.At this time, I'm considering my options and contemplating whether or not to return, do myself, or pay a certified mechanic/installer to make this needed change."
5,Waterway rocks,"I purchased this product to replace a cracked pump due to normal wear and tear. If you get 4 to 5 years out of an above ground pump in Texas, you're the man. I am extremely satisfied with it. It's quiet, powerful and does and excellent job"
4,Wonderful work by A. Roy,"I chose to read this book from a list of books in my women's study class 2 years ago in college. I found the story somewhat difficult to follow at first, so I ordered it on tape. I listened to the reader execute the story and once I was familiar with the characters, I read the rest myself. It was a truly moving story, that I feel, captured the feelings of people in that culture and time. I encourage people to read the book, and be patient while the story and characters unfold."
2,Hmm slightly disappointing.,"I bought this book thinking that since it was written by the same author as the ""black science"" it would be just as good.I was very wrong this entire book falls under the realm of common sense for sale, and I am sorry I even bought it.For those who are new to martial arts this may be gold, but I am afraid they are asking for more than it is worth.Things this book covers is destractions, concealing weapons in a matter conducive to attack (appearing as without a weapon). Hiding (sounds like the other book ""the black science"").Check it out at a library or something before you commit to buying this book.Personally I recommend ""the black science"" instead."
3,an o.k. book,"This was an entertaining book with some good concepts on stealth. But it makes me wonder when co-author Christopher Prowant claims to have a teaching degree in ""wan tzu hu chuan"" I have done extensive research and have come to find that this martial art does not exist."
1,This book doesn't know what it is trying to say,"This book as assigned as the text for a Knowledge Management course I am currently taking. There are many problems with this text. The level of detail goes from theoritical (i.e., explaining what is knowledge, differentiating between tacit and explicit knowledge, etc.) to suggesting how to dress when performing a knowledge capture interview! Seriously, does a textbook on knowledge management need to get into the details how how to dress for an interview with an expert?The other problem is that it states that expert systems have failed, but the KM systems that are discussed throughout the book appear to be just that - expert systems. I have read over half the text so far and I still don't get what they are really trying to tell me.Lukily, my professor has assigned other readings and I am getting much more from these other papers. I also started reading ""The complete idiot's guide to KM"" and found that it is more useable that this text."
3,Textbook Quality,"I have to say that I'm not quite done reading the book, but I have skimmed through the entire thing and have read several chapters. I would like to see more mentioned on security aspects of KM, but so far, not so bad.I don't usually consider this in a book review, but I am disappointed with the physical quality of the book itself. It seems like the authors submitted a color document and took it to the cheapest publisher and had the darn thing photo copied. There are a number of illustrations that simply can't be read. The quality is terrible. This also goes for the labeling of figures, tables, etc.... On one page, I can read that it says Figure X.X but can't really see the text next to it. It is seriously detracting from the book.The book could be the greatest book on KM in the world, but what good is it if you can't clearly see what is on the page?"
4,Chicago Girls Adjustable Quad Skate,"This is a pretty good skate. This was purchased as a birthday gift for my 5 year old. Initially, she couldn't get the skates on by herself, but now she is getting the hang of it. The skates themselves roll quite well, but the wheels and brake got dinged up pretty fast, even though we were on a smooth, recently-paved road. I like the fact that they will grow with her. My daughter's foot measures to be 9 1/2, so the skate is a bit on the big side; however, this didn't seem to bother her as the inside liner fit her foot well. All in all, I would give this skate a high rating. It's just too bad about the big dings/scratches on the wheels and brake. They just don't make plastic like they used to! lol"
3,2nd shipment was great...,"One of the snaps on the buckle was loose and unable to be fixed on the first pair of skates we received. We couldn't let my 5 year old daughter use her new birthday present as a result. She took it well, and the return process with Amazon was very painless. Her new pair showed up about a week later, she was quite happy after that!"
4,girls roller skates,"I got them for my daughters 6th birthday and she loves them! She likes the color, style, and that they adjust to fit her feet as they grow. She uses them outside and in and has no trouble stopping. She loves them!!!"
4,The exact gift I want to buy.,I bought this as a gift for 7 yr girl. Compared item btw toysrus and amazon.4 reasons I order it here.1) Don't need drive to store2) Save on tax3) Consistent on-time shipping and quality of product I got.4) I still have time. 3 weeks to the birthday.I picked amazon. Product comes within 7 days (I used free super shipping).Skate comes out in excellent shape. Size is adjustable.I am sure the girl will enjoy this skate many years to come.
3,May only look good,I read a review that these do not roll good and that is correct. Bought 2 pairs for Christmas so they have not used them yet but they do not roll. Will need adjusting for sure. Hopefully they will loosen some with use but if not we don't have to worry about accidents going so slow. They look great otherwise.
4,Great kid skates for learning for the price,These are good skates if you have kids who are learning to skate. I like that they are adjustable so that they span a few sizes. And the ankles support is stiff enough for learning to skate correctly. I would recommend these.
3,nothing to write home about,"Theres nothing that stood out to me about these skates.They do work , the fit is decent. but the build quality is not that great. to me it seems like they aren't going to last long. the straps feel weak, and they dont buckle tight enough my little ones ankles. the cusion is thin and when you change the size it looks messy, it no longer fits the skate.Over all the price was right, they work well enough, but i dont feel as though i recieved a well built item"
3,"Work, but not durable","These worked pretty well for about a year, then a piece broke off of them and we couldn't get them to work anymore. I would assume that they were used about 10 times before they broke."
4,pleased,I bought this for my 5 years old for christmas. She liked it. Looks sturdy so i am quite pleased
4,great starter skate,"We bought these for our daugher's 4th birthday. They're not too fast, which is good for a beginner. We haven't tried to adjust them to a larger size yet, but it looks simple enough. The buckles adjust easily for a tight fit on the ankle. We found we have to hold the tongue up when she puts her foot in or her toes get stuck in the lining but that's easy enough. I wonder how long the wheels will hold up on the pavement since they look at bit rough around the edges after just a few days of very slow use."
4,Beautiful rollerskates,Excelent! I recomend to buy this item. These are adjustable and really secure for my girl. If you need rollerskates buy Chicago
4,kids skate,"this skate is cute, not bad for the price. I wished the break was rubber and not plastic, other then that I'm all around satisfied."
4,Great Beginner Skates,"I bought these skates for our 5-1/2-year-old daughter for Christmas. I love the sturdy hard shell that supports the legs and the wheels that don't go too fast for her beginner status. My only concern is the toe stop seems to be wearing quickly, but that can easily be replaced. I did a lot of comparison shopping and this was the best deal out there and I am not disappointed. Overall I'd recommend this as a great beginner skate for any girl."
4,High Quality Skates,"My four year old daughter loves these skates. They are high quality and certainly worth the money. They adjust to growing feet. She is just learning to skate so the quad wheels have been good for her, more stabile. I would recommend this product to others."
5,Very pleased with these skates!,"I purchased these skates for my daughter's 5th birthday, and she loved them! She wore them all day and loved the pink and purple design. We love how easily adjustible they are! She is wearing them at the smallest size right now, but with the click of a button we will be able to adjust them up (instead of having to purchase new skates every year!) Definitely worth the price, and I would highly recommend them!"
4,Chicago Girls adjustable skate,My 5 year old was so excited to receive these for her birthday! We took them to a roller skating party and she did great on them with a little help from mom. My only concern (and why I didn't give it 5 stars) was that the tounge part of one of the skate was a little hard to move to the center. I have not tried to adjust the skate yet from the size 1 becasue she's a size 13 1/2. Hopefully as she grows the adjustment will be easy. All of the other kids her age at the rink that rented skates were really slipping and falling constantly...but these were just the right speed for beginners.
2,Can 't believe all the good reviews,This skate has hard plastic wheels - very slippery on the rink. The stopper is also made of hard plastic and couldn't possibly do the job a stopper is intended for. 2 stars for adjustablity though we will be getting quality skates before we ever change the size. Now if a maker would make ACTUAL skates that are adjustable. I'd like all those parents with good reviews to try skating on hard plastic wheels with no usable stopper -
3,"Fast, but misleading",The color of these skates are not as vivid as the online picture shows. They are rather dull. The shipping was very fast and this is an okay buy...
2,Bad Wheels,"We bought these for my daughter's 7th birthday party. She has skated before, but not much, and we wanted skates that would last. They were great at first when she tried them around the house, but as soon as we got to the rink we realized the wheels simply didn't roll like those on the other skates (rentals and skates kids had brought from home). We even tried loosening the nuts a bit and, though that helped some, the skates remained slow and my daughter ended up frustrated, in tears, and ultimately wearing rentals. We will be returning these if they let us."
5,Quad skate,These quad skate are fun and strong enough to last at least the time my little daughter will use the different possible sizes.
3,I was alright!,"I was really happy with this when we first got it. My daughter used it for about 6 months straight, and then the trucks on the bottom, just came off one day from one of the skates. She was so devastated. However, it was really good while it lasted."
5,Great for beginners.,Bought these for my youngest daughter who is 7. She is very tough and these skates are perfect for her. The adjustable skates work good for her growing feet. They roll well and fit true to size. Would recommend them for any beginners.
3,"Great beginner skates, but cheaply made",My daughter loved these skates. I liked that they are adjustable and would last us a couple years. They were her first pair and they were great for a beginner. However after wearing them for only a few weeks she bumped into the steps and the upper clip snapped off! I returned them and purchased a different skate because I didn't want to have to deal with them possibly breaking again.
4,great learner skate,"This skate is perfect for a beginner, I bought for my 4 year old and she loves it, shes able to stand and skate around on it very well, my only issue with this skate is that the stop portion in my opinion is too hard but other than that it is wonderful"
5,excellent learning skates,These skates were purchased for our granddaughters sixth birthday. She loves them and has gone skating several times. She continues to improve each time she tries them.
5,These are perfect!,Great for beginner and intermediate skaters. I ordered 2 pairs for both my 7 and 8 year old and they love them. Being adjustable saves me money and the skates are very pretty.
3,For fans only,"This 2 CD collection highlights a number of cuts that were previous unreleased and\or only found on bootlegs. Sound quality varies. Some good cuts, but this is really for Bop (Harvey) fans only. Monster Butt Beat Dance is a far superior live album."
2,Good Character constructions in the first half of the book,"Agent Cochrane and British Agent Laura Worthington come across as believable and likable people, the remainder of the myriad of characters missed the mark. This was especially true of the arch villain - what exactly drove him anyway? Those of us who seek more in a novel than thriller/suspense scenes were left with nothing for the soul. Hynd often wears his politics on his sleeve in his work, but here his disdain for FBI chief Hoover and adulation of FDR is very pronounced.But for the thriller/suspense fan, Flowers from Berlin is probably as good as it gets and worth the money."
2,flowers from berlin,"This book must have been written by a teenager ,it is a very simple story ,the grammar is simple and basic . i dont understand why anyone gave it a very good review. If you have read Furst or Kerr you wont be able to read this book , i am erasing it from my kindle now"
2,"Good story, poor grammar","This, for better or worse, is a good story. Unfortunately, it suffers from grammar that would not be acceptable from high school students, let alone a ""professional writer."" The poor grammar continues page after page and becomes very irritating very quickly. The book may still be worth reading, but if you care about elementary grammar and spelling mistakes, then stay away from this poorly written book."
5,Noel Hynd did it again! .,Again Noel Hynd has written a book that is not only a page turner but full of interesting and timely facts.
4,How US been dragged into 2nd world war. Very interesting story !,"Generally , we prone to take it granted on US's participation in world war 2. while realty is more complicated than novels. How England tried hard to get her american cousin to participate in the war while Nazi were also tried every lead they can utilize to prevent him from early participation. As Japanese reader, I felt how Japanese Intelligence at that time been so absurd to launch Pearl Harbor attack at such sensitive time."
4,Spy thriller,"Excellent story, character development and suspense. Rivals the best of John le Carre and Frederick Forsyth, and much less expensive!"
2,Too Simple,This book is a very quick and easy read. I am already half way through in just one sitting. While it has good points there are no examples or elaboration. All the information can be gathered from reading each chapter title. The book is good about explaining why each point is important. I was left wanting more information and had hoped for examples to demonstrate each point to aide me in understanding and to help me utilize the ideas in my workplace. Overall I think the book had potential but needs to be fleshed out a bit.
3,Brief. Too Brief,This is a good book.It's got a lot of useful quick tips but I still find myself craving more.It'll start out by telling you something you should do but has very few examples or guidelines that really help.
1,Antenna Booster,"Sorry People, this so called 'Antenna Booster"" aint anything but a stupid sticker with a weird desghin. I know it sounds like a good thing to get but please TRUST me on this one, it sucks all it does and maybe put 1 extra Bar on my phone, or maybe its just cuz i get more signal where i was at that time...Anyways dont get one unless you want to Cuvor up the Important Info. with the sticker. lol"
1,Wrong ad for phone,It wasn't for the phone it said. I ordered for I phone 3G and the cover said it wouldn't work. Took it to AT&T store and my phone couldn't be taken apart to fit the battery
1,?!,"What a neat design for a sticker. But this shouldn't be sold under ""Antenna Booster"" it should be included in a coloring book for kids."
3,"Dos, Dos","Esta caja esta medio medio, es de carton delgadito y las cd vienen en cajas de carton dobladas que tienen el arte y las descripciones de las canciones. Compre esta caja por que me acordaba de las canciones que escuchaba cuando estaba creciendo. ""Telefono"" no esta incluida. Yo podria decir que recomiendo esta cajita si es que en verdad no quieres comprar todos los cds que sacaron que fueron la verdad un monton. Su mejor epoca fue cuando Thalia entro al grupo."
5,Worth the $ to me,"This approach to autotexts saved me as a newbie. Granted an iterative process, but I eventually created over 3,000 in an organized, logical fashion following the wisdom of this book. Loved the part where she does a side-by-side length comparison with and without autotexts. Mindblowing."
5,A Must Have!!,I am currently a MT student who has entered into Beginning Medical Transcription with Intermediate and Advanced Transcripion to go. This was recommended by my instuctors(they are all seasoned RMT/CMT's)to help with enhancing my abilities as a MT. Anyone who is serious about their craft and increasing their production output would do well to include this book in their library. It was everything my instructors said it would be!!!
1,Worthless Nikon NiMH Rechargeable Batteries,"I bought a pair of Nikon NiMH rechargeable batteries for my Coolpix 2100 camera in May. The first time I used it, it was very good, but soon after it discharged quickly. By the fifth time, after one snap shot, the camera started to show the low battery symbol and it took a while for the camera to re-charge and re-shoot again. The result was many lost opportunities to take any good pictures. I just junked it, and bought a pair of Panasonic NiMH rechargeables and worked perfectly since."
1,These are junk.,"I don't know how they can keep selling these things. They work well the first time, after that, no method of recharging brings them back to reasonable life. I felt robbed after buying the batteries and charger."
1,Don't buy these batteries,I did not pay attention to the reviews and bought these batteries. They hold enough charge for a few shots and that's it. Borrowed same sized Evereadys from my son and they're still working after dozens of shots. Buy the Evereadys and charger they cost less and are better.
4,Batteries at a good price,I like to see the stuff`s performance that I bougt. In this case I think this batteries have a good performance and a good price.
2,A Bug,"First of all: I want this programme and I really WANT to rate it five stars because the programme CONCEPT and EXECUTION is wonderful, BUT one ...key doesn?t work!!!! It is quote and apostrophe key. I have contacted Chronos and they can?t resove it. I refuse to believe that I am the only one using OSX Jaguar with this problem. I have done everything from rebuilding the desktop to whatever, but still no solution. Until Chronos can fix this bug the programme remains unpurchased."
2,"Quaint, but not what I was looking for","I was trying to find a desk reference or ""materia medica"" of sorts for using homeopathy with animals. I have been brought up on homeopathic care for myself above going to doctors for colds, allergies and the like so now that I have a cat I am beginning to question typical veterinary practice, especially since my cat was prescribed amoxicillin for an upper respiratory cold and it was even flavored orange - you can imagine trying to give that to an animal that would prefer fish over citrus.This book had some cute illustrations but was more of a story-book that I would have really had to read through all of than a quick, practical reference that I could turn to in recognising and treating symptoms."
3,Great...when it works correctly,"We purchased 6 of these for 5 offices, one of them having 2 terminals due to building size. For some people it works great without problems, for other people, even after replacing the terminals, it will simply not read their finger. Workaround is to use a pin number instead of the fingerprint.The main issue we have run into is that when exporting reports to Excel for payroll, we can not open the reports. Still waiting for a response from support, it seems after you get it installed, they are very slow to respond to any requests. The included reports are limited and there is no option for customizing the reports. Simply concepts such as sorting by last name, first name are not available. Overall it's a great idea, just needs a service pack to get it running where it should."
2,"Not user friendly, marginal benefits, and not very reliable","I found the timeQplus Biometric machine not the easiest thing to set up and use, but I got it working. I needed to refer to the manual to do many of the setup steps and operations. I did not think doing things such as enrolling employees and checking statuses were very intuitive. The reports were only marginally useful. For example, I couldn't figure out how to see all employees currently clocked in.The worst thing about the device is that I found the fingerprint scan to be very finicky and unreliable. Sometimes it worked ok and other times it took 4, 5, 6 tries to read the fingerprint.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the product has a great concept and has a lot of potential. If Acroprint can improve the fingerprint readability and update the software to the look and feel of a modern application then this product could be very beneficial."
2,Don't Bother.... Biometric Time Q plus,"Acroprint Review: These time clocks are made in China, and they have all the quality you would expect of something from China, NOT MUCH. I purchased four clocks for my workplace, and within the first year I had to return every single one of them. Unfortunately, I've had to keep returning them due to various hardware failures. Also, once the clock has some age, the internal lithium battery gives out, but you have to return it to be replaced. In addition, the keypads, which are rarely used, tend to go bad causing multiple entries for just one press of a number button, which makes entering new employees a real pain. The software is clunky and not well written which makes it very prone to errors. After using the system for a couple of years, I strongly urge potential customers to keep looking elsewhere for a more reliable product. This one was ok when working, but a major source of headaches to maintain."
5,A Basic but Most Complete Method,This is a fabulous book for novice actors! An absolute must for the beginner. Summurised in these pages you can find the teachings of the great masters of drama (such as the well known Stanislavski. It is very clear and easy to read and understand even for the complete beginners. On top of all the good advice and techinques you get a lot of exercises to practice what you've learnt till then. It really has helped me with my acting!
2,A Great Video with Fatally-Flawed Sound,"This video is an interesting view of what Yes looked like on their Relayer tour. As a major Yes fan, I wanted to have this in my collection despite having seen and heard it before. Unfortunately I realized I liked it even less than the last time I saw it for the simple fact that most of the time Steve Howe's sound comes in either very weakly or not at all. To watch listen to all 3 songs on Relayer played live *without* being able to hear Steve Howe is just *so* painful. I'll give it a 2 for the good camera work, but overall it sucks, because you can watch Steve Howe and imagine what you're missing. My advice, go for Volume 2; by then the audio problems are largely worked out."
3,THE MAN WHO MIXED THE SOUND SHOULD BE IN JAIL,"I give 3 stars for a clean image and a great performance of the band, but the guy who was in charge of the sound should be still in jail.This is the moment when Yes was at the peak of fame and fortune and when prog-rockers were the icons of fashion. The following year (1976) Yes played in front of an audience of 130.000 fans in USA."
1,Misleading....,Amazon originally featured a photo of this Barbie with Twila the cat. So I ordered it thinking I would receive the Barbie and cat. The package arrived with no cat....misleading to consumers. My daughter was not happy since she loves the cat in the movie.Amazon needs to make sure what they sell is correctly reflected in the photos!
2,SO SO,"WASNT TO HAPPY WITH THIS BARBIE. THE ONES I SAW IN STORES HAD A LITTLE ANIMAL AND DIDNT LIKE HER ARMS, BUT I GUESS THAT IS BECAUSE SHE DANCES."
5,Attention: Twila not included!,"I just got this doll today, and I am also disppointed that Twila was not included. My daughter is also a little sad but still loves the doll. Amazon needs to put the correct picture or at the least state that Twila is not included."
3,Should come with a sewing kit...,"My daughter was thrilled to get Genevieve. Sadly, the bodice of her gown has separated almost completely from the skirt. This resulted after only about a week's worth of play."
3,Dangerous Drum Interactions,This book gives me valuable information regarding any drugs that might be prescribed for me or my family.
5,Great Christmas CD from a great singer!,"Alan Jackson brings us this awesome Christmas album. The title track ""Let it Be Christmas"" is a haunting delight. The tune is wonderful. There isn't a song on this cd that I don't like. His voice makes ""The Christmas Song"" and ""Oh Come All Ye Faithful"" sound so beautiful. This is definately a keeper in your collection. His vocal talents extend into every track. It's lovely."
5,Best Christmas album,I just love this Christmas CD.The title song is my favorite although everysong on this CD is great.
5,"Excellent voice, perfect holiday music","Alan Jackson voice sounds extraordinary on this album, making the Christmas music more memorable than ever."
5,Alan does it asgain,"Alan's Christmas CD is one of the most loved CD. He does a wonderful job on all the songs. He is such a talented Artistand his work shows it. I liked his first Christmas CD, Honky Tonk Christmas,but this one is better. He does such a Great Job on all the songs but Let It be Christmas really hits home. Thanks Alan for all the teriffic music. I have everything that was recored and an axiously awaiting a new CD. Congrats on your Grammy and all the other awards. You deserved each and everyone of them."
5,Christmas song,I got this in the mail on 12-6-2010 the same day they toldedme it was going to be here.I listened to it that day and i loved it.I recommend it to everyone.
5,Wonderful Christmas CD,"Alan Jackson's CD Let It Be Christmas has instantly become one of my Christmas favorites. I prefer traditional Christmas music so it appealed to me immediately. I'm enjoying all the songs and especially the title song ""Let It Be Christmas""."
5,Alan Jackson review,Delivery time was excellent. Description of the product wasn't as complete as I would have liked for it to have been. I didn't know if it was a one song CD or if it was a whole ablum.
1,An expensive paperweight,"Sahai and Khurshid have essentially authored a book with NO purpose. Beginning epidemiologists will find their mathematical proofs impractical and arcane, while biostatisticians will no doubt find them bush-league and simple. Anyone with a practical question about statistics in epi might just as easily find an answer through random-number phone dialing as opening this so-called textbook."
3,Not sure,"I bought this as a gift and have not gotten any feedback on it. It seemed sturdy enough. I would not chance letting the airlines handle it, though."
3,Worth the $ but with gotchas,"I must first say that these are good chips and a nice case for the money I paid. However, I would have liked them to ACTUALLY include BICYCLE playing cards since that's what the ad says. They are NOT Bicycle cards. Very cheap cards at best. Also, It took about a month to get my product. Why so long when I live less than an hour away? Anyway, I don't mind the product but wouldn't buy from this person again."
3,"Good chips, everything else so-so...","As others have noted, the cards are NOT Bicycle cards but cheap knock-offs. My kit did include a dealer button. The case has held together so far, but does feel less than sturdy.The chips themselves are great - heavy, smooth, uniform, and for the most part defect-free (so far).Remember: Read the review, not the description - it's misleading, at least in the case of the cards. Also of note, for those like me who didn't do the math: this set is HEAVY - 500 11.5 gram chips, plus case, totals out to about 18.7 pounds for the set."
2,Latch on case broke within MINUTES,"I had the case out of the box for about TEN MINUTES when I made the mistake of picking it up by the handle, which snapped off.Other than that, I'm totally pleased."
3,"ok, they really are chips","it comes in a cheap case, the latch wouldn't close, the cards weren't what they were suposed to be, there is no dealer button, who uses dice in a poker game, BUT, ok, they really are chips."
5,Norway-From the Land of Vikings,"This is a unique travel video that was produced in 2003. Dale Johnson and his team present 82 minutes of beautiful photography and informative facts. Norway's customs, livelihoods and history are personally explained by Mr. Johnson. The Vikings, World War II occupation and the pilgrimage road to Trondheim's Nidaros Cathedral during the Middle Ages are but a few of the mentioned topics. Mainly, it is a film about the Norwegians of today, their professions and their spirit. On occasions, the author appears in the film, adding a very personal feel to the show. A five star presentation all around."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this even with all the bad reviews about the top. I thought for such a good price ($16) I would just replace the plastic perk top from the get go with a glass one. Well, this one is not made so that the perk top can be unscrewed; it has to be broken off of the top. Also, the hole it leaves in the top is too small for the ""fitz-all"" replacement perk tops. Guess I'll use it awhile only while watching it, and if the plastic breaks I'll just ream out the hole to be able to get a replacement glass perk top into it. It does look very nice but, like all the new percolator manufacturers, they seem to be concerned only with making a pot of coffee FAST rather than really brewing the coffee. That's why the new ones are 1000 watts. I prefer the old 450 watt percolators that really brew the coffee for 15-20 minutes. Anyway, that's my take on this product."
1,Stainless Steel Percolator,"I am so glad that reviews are allowed. This is the main reason I'm shopping. I inherited a genuine Farberware 8 cup percolator from my grandmother that she had for many years. I started using it before she died and it came with a plastic see through perc top. I've been using the pot for a year and suddenly the little plastic parts that were holding the top in place broke off. I thought I would be able to find the part but have been unsuccessful. However I've learned to improvise. I've placed a heavy small saucer over it and it's working like a charm. To impress someone with it would be horrible, but it's still working and I thank all of those who gave their reviews. I'll stay with my current percolator until it stops working all together."
3,"Good, but Cord Connection Gives Out","Coffee maker is fine, perhaps a little small if more than 2 coffee drinkers (each wanting a few cups), but after a year the cord connection has given out."
1,substandard parts,I bought this coffee pot on Dec. 28th 2001. We love the taste of perked coffee and was very pleased until the end of Jan. when the PLASTIC top broke under the lid. I called Melitta and was told they would replace it but that it would take a minimum of 8 weeks due the number of people who were having the same problem. I received my new lid in April and today it broke again. It is definitely a defect in the product. Why can't they make them (the top where you can see it perking) out of glass? You cannot find a glass replacement at any store.Want two pots?
2,Not Reliable,"Initially, we loved it! However, less than one after we bought it, it stopped brewing hot coffee. Puzzled, I thought I would check out the reviews of this product while shopping for a new coffee maker. I was shocked to read that this happened to someone else as well. I guess I should have done more homework before making my purchase!"
4,Great machine. Poor after-sales service,"This is the best coffee maker ever. I have spent 40 years brewing coffee every morning, using a whole variety of machines. This is the easiest and makes fantastic coffee with very little effort. If you buy a cheap wall-outlet type timer, you can also set this to brew coffee before you get out of bed. Great! (That goes for most brewers/percolators, - obviously).However.. if the transparent plastic knob breaks, then you are sc**wed, because eSalton (Melitta) has no means to contact them. Their toll free number is useless: it gives you three options, the third is for spare parts, but when you choose 3 you return to the three choices again! (Pressing 0 will disconnect you). So.. great machine but no parts service, so I guess that if your lid is slightly damaged, then buy another $60 percolator!!!"
1,Not for heavy coffee drinkers,This initially was a great coffee pot producing good hot coffee in minutes. I ran into trouble after about four months of using the pot at least twice a day. It simply stopped working. I now have to plug the pot in at least three times to make a descent pot of coffee. Perhaps if you don't drink coffee as much as my family this is the pot for you.
3,Good Coffee,"The coffee maker makes excellent coffee,but the plastic lid is broken and I can not find where I can order a new lid.Can anyone help me?Thanks"
1,worked great - for six months.,What more needs to be said? Followed all instructions and yet I am now having to look for a new percolator. How exactly do companies keep making garbage products and we buy them?
1,Very poor design,"It seems that there is always something crappy in a good design. The pot does a good job perking coffee, but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot. I think that Melitta should send out, for nothing the glass top. I am like the other reviews, I would not buy another Melitta product unless they make good on this pot. There is a danger of the top blowing out and Melitta could be in for law suits."
3,Perfect except for the top!,"The plastic percolator thingy on the top broke after a couple of months. I am trying to get a replacement top from Salton, but they have been out of stock for the last 4 months! My husband and I love the coffee almost as much as french pressed, and it's so fast! It's also the perfect amount for us. I don't want to buy a whole new coffemaker just to replace the top and not if its going to break just like the old one!"
1,Doesn't Last,I have now purchased two of these percolators and both times the pot only produces hot coffee for about one year. One or more of the heating elements must eventually burn out and your coffee goes from wonderfully hot to lukewarm. Most people who use percolators do so because it produces hotter coffee than a drip but this model does not continue to do that for more than a year or so.
3,short life span,My mother in law and I both bought this coffee pot. We were very pleased with them. The coffee was very hot and delicious. We have had our pots for a little over a year. Hers stopped working first. The coffee was not getting as hot and then it stopped working all together. Mine lasted about a week longer than hers. Both of us use our coffe makers twice a day most days. I felt like they should have lasted longer than a year. Because of this we were disappointed with the product
1,Doesn't Last!,"We have gone through 3 of these percolators (using it only 3-4 times per week) in less than 2 years! It starts out with the top plastic perk-handle falling apart -- then off, followed by half brewed coffee, and eventually nothing but warm discolored water. We hand washed it after each use -- never was put in the dishwasher. Coffee was great -- too bad they don't last. We WILL NOT waist $'s on another one!!!"
3,two pots in less then one year,"We enjoy the coffee from this pot very much, except for the fact that we have returned it to the store twice in one year, the same defect. The glass top has broken on both pots. We're ready to trash the pot an go with a different brand. We enjoy perk coffee much better then that of a coffee maker."
2,Its OK,I have used it a few chilly mournings this winter. I have smaller hands and there's just too much space and open air inside the muff to keep hands warm. I'm thinking about adding some fleece towel or some other insulation to fix that problem. I havent used it with a hand warmer yet and will update my review after I tried it.
2,"Perhaps ""RENT"" should be highlighted............","This book contains alot of good information, however the title is deceiving. The main topic of the book is ""how to obtain and then rent multiple unit structures for monthly cash flow"". Jay barely touches on rehabbing for quick sale as the title might suggest. Also, many of ""Fixer Jay's"" points are repaeted throughout the book, almost for the sake of quantity of content......A decent book for the individual thinking of owning rentals, but for rehab flipping, FORGET IT!"
1,sleazebag slumlord,"this guy explains in detail how to take advantage of people and profit off their misfortunes. Even if you want to do this yourself, he's more interested in telling tales of conquest than offering useful advice. Don't buy this book!"
2,Carbon copy of every other book out there,"These books all seem to be the same -- give a few basic ideas, then repeat them for 200 or 300 pages. By the time I got to the end of this, I was half expecting him to finish with a pitch for one of his seminars. I am interested in the renting aspects, and there were a few helpful nuggets in here, but I suspect it could have all been boiled down to a much shorter book."
2,"Misleading Title, Cover, and Table of Contents....","As with most of the other reviews, this book was disappointing. Instead of the title saying ""Selling (and renting)"" it should say just ""Renting."" He discourages selling consistently, so if you are looking for a book on buying, fixing, and selling, this is NOT it. He also seems to completely ignore the power of the internet in the process of marketing and selling houses, doing research on properties, etc. Additionally, he uses terms frequently that are never defined, especially for discussions on financing. Overall, a real disappointment... Too bad I did not read the reviews before buying the book. I would have made a different choice."
2,Focused on becoming a landlord-NOT SELLING,"This book doesn't go into ""adding value"" as the title suggests. He also goes little into selling property.Here is the whole book:Buy a crappy looking house with apartments and slummy tenants. Slowly get rid of the slummy tenants. Do cheapo paint jobs, put blinds on the windows, clean up the trash and water the grass. Now raise rents for tenants. The profit is from rents. Not selling.If you want to become a slum lord this is a great book."
2,Dissapointed. Really this book seems to be geared to buying apartmement rentals,"This book was ok, but could have been better. Most of the content seems geared more tword people who are interested in buying multiple rental units like apartements. Not family homes. Plus the material seems outdated as he recommends scouring the claffied advertisements for properties to purchase.At the beginning of the book, the author recommends marking up the book with a highliter. I would seriously discourage that in case you wish to resell the book."
3,Not too much help,This book offers very little advice in the way of flipping real estate. If you are looking to buy houses and use them for rental property than this is the book for you. If you are looking to buy-fix-sell then this book overlooks that type of audience.
5,first impressions,"This is my 2nd External USB enclosure, and it was by far cheaper in price. When I got the box and openened it, I expected to get the usual step by step zillion things to do - but no! This little enclosure came with such simple components that opening it and completing the job took me less than 2 minutes - no kidding. It comes with a nice little screwdriver, a few screws with extras in case you lose some. After inserting the drive, the only effort was to screw the back panel in with 2 screws and I was done. Last thing: it's more like a sleeve than an enclosure. It is really that slim."
3,Dosn't work with Vista!,"I could not get this thing to work with Windows Vista. I tried everything I could, but got no where.Overall, the design of the product is pretty good. I did get a full refund from TigerDirect.com, so if you make the same mistake I did, it wont be that much of a hassel to get your money back."
4,Works as advertised,"It's an aluminum external enclosure. Features internal IDE connection, external USB 2.0. My only complaint would be the requirement for an external power supply. I'd much prefer if the device were able to draw its power from the USB connection."
4,Simple and easy,It does what it supose to do. Putting it all the pieces is where I have my thoughts. To many screws to put !
1,DOA,"1. had a hard disk fail at home. bought this unit to try to access the files on the disk, but no computer could see the files. but, they all acknowledged the usb device was connected. assumed the disk was trashed, not much important stuff lost.2. two weeks later, my wife's office computer's hard disk started having trouble. put it into the enclosure and no access to files this time, either. hmmm. funny thing, the computer will not shutdown or startup with this unit attached.looked at the circuit board and it looks dirty almost like it had been reworked. ugh.once again, you get what you *don't* pay for"
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY!,"My computer broke a couple of weeks back and found myself looking for a hard drive enclosure to be able to read my files. Bought this one based on it's low price and the one 5 star user rating.My hard disk was a Seagate 120GB with all my files from the broken PC. I jumped the drive to MASTER, hooked up the cables, slide the drive inside, plugged in the power cable to AC power and the USB cable to my laptop... and voila!...it shows as new drive letter on MyComputer. All my files were there :). WORKS LIKE A CHARM!!!I think, the only issue you might notice is that it is not very convinient for swapping hard drives (if you have more than one) because of little screws you have to unscrew and screw back to secure the drive inside. But it doesn't matter to me since I intend to use it as a permanent enclosure. If I get a new hard drive, I would definitely get another one of this."
5,Did what I needed,"I bought this enclosure when my 7 year old mac died. I wanted to be able to transfer my files, and needed something cheap. I bought this one based on reviews, and I generally concur with other reviewers. Installing the hard drive was straight forward. I don't think that the enclosure would stand up to repeatedly putting in different hard drives as the set screws are small and the internals are not that robust. However, if you expect to just put in one drive and leave it, I would recommend this enclosure. It took maybe 15 minutes to assemble and set up and use, didn't get hot, worked very reliably, I was able to mount the drive easily, I experienced no problems."
2,Super Home Suite,"Although not difficult to navigate and operate, I was very dissapointed to find that this product does not generate a material list! Also, this product does not have the ability to create any foundation plan.Some basic ""Important Features"" somebody didn't think was needed.Now I'm stuck with software I cant use.Kind of like buying a car without a steering wheel!!!"
2,Limited functions and quirky results,"As other reviewers have stated, this software has some real issues. Some research indicates that the software engine is about 5 years old, which could explain a lot. It does not conform to basic Windows API standards. Things like undo do not work. Selecting objects can be frustrating, if you have several close together (Corel solves this by using the tab key to sequentially select objects). But my biggest complaints are the topography tool, which works in a bizarre fashion, and the help files, which are no help at all.On the plus side, I was able to make a reasonable drawing of my house, so that I could envision an addition. But trying to get the lay of the land right was impossible. So for pretty cheap, you can do basic drawing and planning. I give it the 'high' rating of 2 stars because it's cheap. But you don't get what you don't pay for. Spend more on something else and save yourself the hassle."
1,I'd like to Punch! the programmer....,"This is the most frustrating software I've ever used. I would like to Punch! the programmer. I've used older versions of 3DHome Architect and loved them. I have completely renovated my home using 3D and have added a sunroom with it. I could never completely grasp the stairs feature or roof features. Very confusing. I purchased Punch! because I loaned the 3D program to someone else and didn't get it back and thought I would give this one a try. I am pretty adept at figuring out software, but I really felt angry and frustrated with this program to the point of wanting to seriously throw my whole computer out the window or beat it senseless with a large hammer. If you are looking for a good design program, this IS NOT IT. The reviews for the lastest 3DHome Architect don't sound good either, so I am going to try to return this stupid thing and get Home and Garden's version. I hope this is helpful."
3,loves wow but disappointed this time,"The blue disk is awesome, with all songs at least hitting the top 20, several hit and held the number one spot. The bad news is that there were several songs on the red disk that did not receive any play time on the stations I listen to - I can't think of a single song that I liked."
3,Not what I expected.,This had to much hard rock music(could not understand words) and not enough praise music. This CD does not provide the wonderful music that I was looking for.
3,Good variety collections,"The CD is well packed and of good quality. Most of the songs have the same style of music and some have variety. In short it is good product and worth for money. But I've never got the companion DVD as specified in the deacsription of the product. If the DVD is not available, please remove it from the description."
4,Incredibly talented...,"This is not Jeff's best work in terms of hilarity, but it certainly is the best showcase of his talent to date. By the end, he's using five different voices at once. Absolutely amazing!Don't get me wrong, it was funny. I just found his earlier work to be funnier."
5,Hilarious,"Mr. Dunham is hilarious and this DVD is no exception. He brings some personal issues to the forefront but he makes them as funny as the rest of the show. Love, love, love this DVD!!"
5,Wow!,He hasn't lost his touch yet! His new material is really funny! His 2 new friends are impressive. The extra material on the DVD is awesome too! Buy it!
4,Love Jeff!,"We went to see this in Detroit and loved it - except for the new lady puppet and I am glad he left her out. I bought this for 5 of my family members for Christmas and they love it, too. Go, Jeff - and Walter...and Achmed...and Peanut and Jose, Jalepeno on a steeck- Bubba, just keep drinking your beer...."
3,Not as good as he once was,This title is good enough to add to your library primarily because of the lack of funny comedians. I don't think this is something one would like to see multiple times.
2,"HMMM, Left me Wondering a Bit","As much as I love Jeff Dunham I have to say I was really disappointed with Controlled Chaos. Not a lot of new material, alot of carrier over from previous shows.Dialogue just didnt flow smoothly between Jeff and the Characters. The new characters didnt add any greatness either. Very crude, a little over the top.Wanted to purchase this when it came out, Im glad i waited to see it on Comedy Central first. :("
3,Not Quite,"Although Mr. Dunham has created a funny show, there are a few segments which I found a little disturbing. Making fun of the famine and poverty in Africa along with the politics of S. Africa just isn't my cup of tea. This show, in my honest opinion, should not be shown to children. Compared to his earlier works, this one is sorely lacking."
4,Worth watching,"I haven't seen Jeff Dunham live yet, but I love his DVD's and specials. Even after seeing them lots of times, I still laugh at almost everything in the earlier ones.This new one was a mix for me, though. There were stretches where I laughed so hard I was literally tearing up, while other times I was just staring at the screen with distaste. I think he crossed the line a few times too many. Still, the funny parts were well worth sitting through the rest, so I still give it four stars. His improvisation is, as always, fantastic!"
1,Not so great,"I usually love his comedy and his characters, but this DVD just left me wondering 'what happened'. Why does he have to be crude? Is crude all that funny? I found the crudeness totally unnecessary. I'm very disappointed. Rent it from your local library and decide for yourself if it's worth your money."
2,Dunham's worst!,"Jeff Dunham has had MUCH better acts then the one that he has put out in this video. This one just lacks the luster and spark that he has had in others. Not one of his best, and I hope that this is the last that we see of this type of material from him and that he gets his mojo back!"
4,Gift,Gave this as a gift and cannot actually rate this movie. Wish you cold just say Gift and leave it at that.
3,Good if you like Jeff Duham,This was a gift for my husband who WAS a Jeff Dunham fan....Not so much now....but he enjoyed it when it came in...
5,Love Jeff Dunham,It was a gift. My grandson loves it. We both love Jeff Dunham and this is another fun DVD of his.
5,Great,Very funny! This DVD has all the puppets on it and is worth the cost. I have been to his live shows and this is almost as good.
5,Love Jeff Dunham,I bought this movie and it was exactly what I was hoping it to be! Extremely funny and a little racy if you choose unedited.
3,Jeff Dunham Monsters,It was alright. Not as good as his other ones. I still like him and peanut. My husband likes peanut the best.
5,Best yet!!!,"I won two tickets to this filming and it was SO COOL!!!! Can't wait to get the DVD. I laughed so hard I cried. DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!! Man, so funny."
3,not one of his best,"This was not one of Jeff Dunhams best shows. the quality was good, however not sure i will ever watch it again. may want to just buy the regular DVD...and save some money..."
3,Disappointed by Jeff Dunham's new act,"My first mistake was PURCHASING the DVD, assuming Jeff's performance would be just as entertaining as his other ones. Not so. He's got new material for his characters, but most of it just wasn't funny. About half-way through, I suggested to my husband that we turn it off and watch something else. But we watched it to the end and were totally taken by his bit with the 'little' version of some of his characters. I give him 2-thumbs-up for being able to have a 'conversation' with 4 different ones PLUS himself!!! THAT was awesome!!! Too bad it was the only part of the show that made me laugh out-loud, and too bad it only lasted 5 minutes. Next time I'll borrow the DVD from someone before buying it. Live and learn!"
3,It was okay,"I wasn't too thrilled with the WV 'hell' joke. I know WV is hell. I should. I lived there for almost 19 years. I don't anymore cause like I said--It's hell. I have the right to say that because I lived there. I don't think Dunham had any right to say something like that unless he has facts on why he would say it.Other than that I was extremely pleased with the level of service I had through through Amazon and the user as well. I lost my paper work telling me who that was, but nonetheless I am still really impressed."
3,Its ok...,"...but he has done much better. We enjoyed his first 3 dvd's better but his act seems to same pretty much the same, all the way to his newest DVD. When you can watch him and know what he's gonna say....no more explanation should be needed at this point. Still worth watching, as Walter has to be the funniest in this one."
5,Awesome find,DVD still in packaging!!! Great for the price! Works well. Jeff Dunham is hysterical and the DVDs are perfect for my family!
4,"good, but not his best","While jeff Dunham is one of the funniest comediens out there, his latest DVD isn't the best I've seen. The high point is the end, which leaves you breathless from laughing, while the rest has several great moments, but not a laugh until you cry from start to finish like his other DVD's. Still a worth while purchase, well worth the cost."
5,great product,"It is a great DVD, came in on time. Played right out of the box. It was everything it was advertised to be."
2,Not As Good As His Old Acts,"I've been a Jeff Dunham fan for years, but this last performance ""Controlled Chaos"" just did not come across to me as his best. It seemed like the timing of most of the jokes was off. I also didn't care for the appearance of Achmed's son with his face half removed. I didn't see anything really funny about that. We've got too many war veterans coming back missing parts of their anatomies and I've never found the conflict in Afganistan or Iraq to be particularly humorous. That part of the act came off to me as awkard, not funny.To me it appears that Jeff has become distracted and his comedy is suffering for it. I hope he gets back on track soon."
5,Jeff Dunham: Controlled Chaos,Shoot yourself in the foot if you don't buy this dvd. Holy crap is this some funny stuff right here.
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I was disappointed. This dvd drags and drags. He is too long with each dummy, without much humor. I had to turn it off half way through to watch the rest at another time. There is excessive bleeping which gets annoying quickly. There are too many close-ups of the dummy where the viewer wants to see Jeff doing his craft. Don't send for it."
1,Two thumbs down,I had ordered this dvd for Christmas. I got it before then which was great but when i went to watch it on Christmas Eve. I found it to be not funny at all. The F word is used by every puppet and the jokes could be altered to be funny. I used to like Jeff Dunham but i'm very disappointed in this dvd. I must say i am not so sure i will want to order his next one that comes out. He might be not be married any more but i have to say when hew as married his stuff was A LOT more funny....and AJ the new puppet reminds me of Chucky. that demented doll from the old movies. I must say this is the first dvd i wish i had known was like this i would not have gotten it. even the extra's are not impressive to me. I must say others might find this funny however i do not and i think he needs a realty check if he is going to continue this career of his.
2,Disappointed,"Full of FOUL language. NOT the Jeff Dunham that I love. I wish I never would have bought it. It seems he has resorted to bad language to fill in the time. While it had it's humorous points, it was not what I would've paid for by any means. The skits just are in poor taste and I am so very disappointed in him. Whatever has caused the change in his material, I hope he cleans it up before he does another DVD or show."
5,Amazing,This is the best DVD of Jeff Dunham's so far. Two new characters! Buy the DVD then go see him live.
5,very very funny,big jeff dunham fan. very funny . gets better every year. and as usual was delivered in a timely manner from amazon. he added a couple of new dummys i didn:t care for but the regulars make up for them. i would defitnely suggest anyone who likes to laugh buy this one
5,sooo funny!,Got a great pre-release price! I love Jeff! A whole bit was on the DVD that wasn't on the comedy special. And the special features were neat you can see the awesome puppet making technology he has now.
4,Well worth the watch,"Short review this time.The only reason I dropped this to 4 stars vs. 5 is that it seemed kind of short. I also didn't think ""Son of Achmed"" was that funny.It is still a very funny show and is definately worth the watch.The extra's such as Flirting With Victoria and Share The Hair had me LMAO. Go to his official site for previews if you want to know more about it."
1,NOT FOR FAMILY NIGHT,"Well, we have previously watched Jeff with the boys, but this one, I am VERY SORRY to say, was uncomfortable at best. And yes, I think he needs a new writer, or to get started writing some funny, non bleeping humorous skits. I just dont find it necessary. The early years were not bleeped. And yes, I am sure the divorce still hurts, but he need to keep the new hottie out of it! Where are the funny comedians without the vulgarity???"
2,too raunchy,"I love Jeff Dunham, but this fourth DVD is a disappointment. I think he is out of good material and even the deleted version was too much for our family night. I love the first two, though."
5,Funny!,This is just outright FUNNY! Jeff introduces two new characters. Hysterical. I would recommend this for the whole family. It keeps getting better.
2,Disappointing,"This performance was very disappointing, especially compared to his two earlier DVDs. The references to his shows in South Africa were over-the-line. Some of the references were hurtful and unnecessary, while some were funny. He knows better.Far too many F-bombs too. It seems like he was going for shock-value to make up for the weak material. Except for a few exceptions, it just wasn't funny.Better luck next time Jeff.Steve"
2,"Personal disclosure, more sad than funny","I watched the show on Comedy Central with my wife and son - all great fans of Walter, Peanut, Achmed and Jose. But this show will, more me at least, be less remembered for his ventriloquist act but for his self-disclosure of early life and divorce. Otherwise, not much new ground, Achmed's son - nothing funny there. Peanut and Jose, along with little Jeff and little Peanut were the highlights.Unfortunately the most memorable segment was the intro; his school pictures and commentary were priceless. A setup for the next segment with Walter; where Jeff poked fun at his divorce. I found his divorce diatribe uncomfortable, if not sad, as much as it was funny. Perhaps his next show will touch on pathetic middle-aged men leaving their wives, in this case a 29 year old nutritionist. I think and hope not, best get back to the lives of his dummies, far more interesting and funny."
1,Same old stuff,"I thought Jeff was going to do something different for this special, but yet he did some jokes he did 10 years ago. I thought he was going to introduce Debbie.And I thought he had new puppets; Achmed's Son was it! I was not happy about this performance..."
1,dreadful,"As a longtime fan of Dunham's, I find it difficult to say this, but... this show is dreadful. The jokes are knee-jerk racist slop.I watched the DVD as far as the first two minutes of Peanut, but things got no better.I have a considerable tolerance for what others might define as offensive, but these routines are merely derivative of so many prejudices, without giving the viewer any sort of resolution.Very sad, very disappointing."
4,Controlled Chaos,"I've seen Jeff Dunham on TV and I must say he is a great entertainer. I also watched Controlled Chaos on TV so I thought I'd get it to show when company comes over, if they have never seen Jeff Dunham."
5,Jeff Dunham: Controlled Chaos,Another great show done by Jeff Dunham. Full of laughs and funny moments however this one is a little more racy than the others.
5,Jeff is hilarious,Great DVD from Jeff. He is hilarious and his new 'dummies' are good too. Save yourself the admission price of his shows and buy this DVD. You will not regret it!!!!
4,SILENCE I KILL YOU,Love Achmed so when I saw that he...no no no NO Spoilers here. The DVD was fun still jump in some sections still the quality was great and the bloopers section was so funny. great DVD I recommend it.
4,Funny Stuff With A More Adult Edge,"When I received the DVD Controlled Chaos in the mail, I was excited to see something new from Jeff Dunham. I've watched both his prior Comedy Central specials on DVD several times and really enjoyed them. Maybe I didn't read thoroughly enough before I ordered, but the only thing that surprised me about this release was that it was more ""adult"" oriented content, so, I was sure not to watch it around my kids. With the prior Comedy Central speicals, I had put them on ""edited"" mode and my kids would watch them until their interest waned. This usually took a few minutes to half an hour but half an hour was rare.It was my mistake for not checking for content on this one, I know. I just dislike having to wait til both kids are asleep or busy elsewhere to watch this release. I still very much enjoyed it though."
3,enjoy dunham BUT,"enjoy dunham's shows but this dvd has audio problems.had to keep raising,& lowering volume.at times the audiance is a lot louder then dunham's voice.woul not recommend this dvd."
3,Jeff Dunham Controlled Chaos,As usual Jeff hits another home run with this video. He introduces a couple new characters and a lot of new material as well. Some I have heard still thought his first 2 videos were funnier but I thought this one was still funny and worth watching for sure.
5,Jeff Dunham Blue Ray DVD,"Got it fast and in great shape, good price. Will order again. Will recommend this product and seller to my friends."
5,a must see,This show is hilarious. I love this man and his puppets. I couldn't stop laughing and Amazon was terrific. No problems or complaints here.
2,Dunham has sold out to Las Vegas,"The first two DVDs by Jeff Dunham were terrific. In those DVDs Jeff's stage presentation was simple and fully allowed Jeff to be intimate with his audience and contribute his amazing skills of ventriloquism. Sadly, this DVD takes a plunge into being a piece of Las Vegas junk. The presence of multiple screens onstage, audiences that have been pre-prepared to clap, ""hoot and holler"", in phony appreciation that breaks up the flow of Jeff's presentation. Spotlights swiveling back and forth onstage to further ""jazz up"" the show. It seems that Jeff has sold out to the phony, slick Las Vegas type of show ($$$) that turns the quality of his work into pure junk. Money corrupts, so I won't be enabling Jeff's corruption by spending any more of mine on his future DVDs."
4,Jeff Dunham-Controlled Chaos,I liked the video. Was surprised by the more swear words in it as my 2 and 4 year old love peanut and bubba J.
5,jeff dunham:controlled chaos.,it was great i wish he would do more i enjoy waching him and so does my 13 grandchildren and 16 greatgrandchildren. thanks
4,Uncontrollable,These guys are a riot. Watch over and over and hear or see something new every time. Love them all.
3,GOOD DVD,"Not as funny as Jeff Dunham ""Arguing with myself"" to me, I have watched Arguing with myself several times and it's just as funny as the first time I watched it. Controlled Chaos was funny in parts, but hey don't let my review stop you from purchasing it. You may find this one VERY funny."
3,Jeff Dunham: Controlled Chaos,"Although Controlled Chaos was funny for the most part, it was not as good as his previous three DVDs. The routines were not as good and I think the two new characters he introduced (Achmed's brother and Little Jeff) should be retired immediately."
4,Another hit for Jeff Dunham,"Though not as edgy as his prior DVDs, still a great video filled with lots of great humor. And you won't want to miss the surprise for Achmed at the end. And a bonus for me is the fact that this video was filmed in my home town. A very welcome addition to my Jeff Dunham collection. Always a pleasure to watch."
4,Awesome!!,"So funny, enjoyed immensely!! Love Jeff Dunham, Peanut, Jose, Walter and the whole gang. Achmed is hilarious as well as the rest of the characters."
5,awesome,Dunham is AWESOME!!! Been hooked since I first saw him on Comedy Central. Nothing else needs to be said... he's awesome.
2,Won't buy again,"I purchased this through amazon since it was cheaper than using the phaltzgraff website, which I usually use. This was a replacement for a broken plate from a set I've owned for a few years. The description of the product is incorrect. It seems Pfaltzgraff decided to go with manufacturing in China and this plate is obivously reduced quality. You can tell right off that the plate is lighter in weight than previous additions and the paint job is not a deep blue as described. It is a lighter blue and the outside ring is thinner in width. I can live with it because I want a complete set but I will not be purchasing any more items from Pfaltzgraff until they start making these back in the USA. I'll go to a thrift store and look for replacement next time."
5,Inexpensive and it works,"Needed these for a car project, to power old Motorola phones from 12v source. These work great. They're Alltell brand, leftover stock I'm presuming.Not much else to say:* Inexpensive* Works/charges"
4,Quick study for non-FPE trainee test,I'm looking to make a career change -- this quick read got me in the right frame to take the SIA exam that brokers reqquire as part of the interview process
4,Math for Financial Industry a WINNER!!!!,I needed help with calculations for passing the Series 7 Stock Broker exam. This book makes it as simple as it gets. The financial math is no longer a daunting challenge. Thanks for writing this book!
4,The Numb3rs of Finance,"This book is great for anyone thinking about entering the securities field, or just interested in taking a more active role in managing his or her own investments. If you've been away from formal math studies for some time, the author's patient step-by-step approach to all calculations is reassuring. He begins with a very helpful section on the proper use of a calculator. (I suspected that there were some neat things it could do that I hadn't explored yet!) An added bonus: the book includes ""every calculation needed for the Series 7 test,"" for those considering a career (or second career) as a General Securities Registered Representative (Stock Broker)."
4,wonderfully cynical,"The _Geography of Nowhere_ is a scathing attack on post-WWII (sub-)urban planning. Kunstler had no formal training at the time he wrote the book and channels his anger and cynicism towards his surroundings into an effective - yet readable - analysis of our cities. People are beginning once again to champion 'living downtown' and walking and using public transit. Kunstler did it ten years ago - at a time when very few of us were thinking about it. Unfortunately, as is common with many critiques, Kunstler does not have very many solutions to urban planning problems - he leaves those for his next book, _Home from Nowhere_."
4,The State of the United States,"This book does an extrememly good job of describing the current state of the United States. I read this book for my anthropology class. It was a very interesting read, and I certainly recommend it."
2,Grumpy old man visits the suburbs.,"""The Geography of Nowhere"" doesn't say much aboutthe problems of suburban development thatJane Jacobs didn't cover much better in ""The Deathand Life of Great American Cities"". I'd recommendGarreau's ""Edge City"", instead, for a dissentingview on urban planning."
5,Provocative criticism of suburbia and modern development,"James Kunstler's ""The Geography of Nowhere"" is both an explaination of how we got to the Superhighway/Suburbia landscape and of how we might escape it.Kunslter is at his best when he describes how two different government decisions helped us arrive at where we are at today. First the investment in the system of highways helped spur the demand for cars within American families. Every family could now move around at an accelerated pace. Secondly the system of loans for family homes helped encourage the creation of suburbs ringing once prosperous and lively cities.Both disasters such as Syracuse, NY and successes like Portland, OR are described. Kunslter's example of Paris with its broad boulevards and open cafes gives a great contrast with the San Diego freeway and downtown office culture in the US.Intelligently written and often opinionated, its book to be recommended and one that's had a fair amount of influence since its publication."
3,Passable,"This particular Windham Hill CD is okay. It has several nice pieces but overall, there are better Windham Hill recordings out there."
1,Buyer Beware,"This CD is ""copy protected"" and will not work in iTunes or on your iPod. So much for the holiday spirit .. I buy a CD and they won't even let me listen to it on my iPod!"
2,Windham Hill Christmas rehash,"If you've been a follower of the Solstice albums over the years, don't buy this... It's just rehash of older material assembled around Christmas themes."
1,Cant Listen to it on My iPod??,I love Windham Hill but if I cant download it to my iPod then Im moving on.
5,A fantastic new release,"This is my first Windham Hill CD, but I have listened to at least one of their artists (J. Brickman) previously. Every year I shop for new Christmas CDs in November, and this one came out in October, so it's good timing.For the most part the songs are smooth, mellow, and very relaxing, taking a pretty traditional approach to the songs. The only exceptions are the ""Sussex Carol"", which is somewhat fast, and ""Christmas is Coming"", by Vince Guaraldi, which is quite fast.As one fellow reviewer noted, tracks 5 and 6 are switched from the liner track listing. When I first listened to [the supposed] ""First Noel"" I thought, ""What kind of version is this?!"" until I listened to the other track and realized the mix-up.If you want an easy-listening night by the fire this is a wonderful accompaniment. It should enjoy a long life in my Christmas CD collection."
2,yawn,"So much of the great Windham Hill music is disappearing for some reason. When I listen to my (now out of print) Windham Hill Collection with greats such as Shadowfax, Tuck and Patty, Mike Manring, Darol Anger, Mike Marshall, Andy Nerrell, George Howard, etc. it brings such pleasant memories. So many great performances that have been overshadowed by the over-produced over-hyped pop crap we have today. These virtuosos are mysteriously missing from this so called ""Windham Hill"" album. I think that this was probably assembled from some demo tapes left on the floor. For one thing, there's too much f'n piano! Most of the recordings are dull and uninspired. Guess I'll use it for background music when dinner conversation is required."
4,Wonderful !,It is a ovely addition to our CD library of Christmas music. Played it throughout the season and truly enjoyed it..
3,Needs editing,"Loved the book. The story was fast paced and I could not wait to see how it ended. This was a free book and I would read his other books, but the editing was SO bad that I do not want to pay for them. If the editing was there it would have received a 5."
3,My Thoughts On Angels Fall,"The story was fine, but the typos were horrendous. Also, the right margin cut off the last two letters of each line. VERY frustrating."
4,If Angels Fall,This was a real page turner. Rick Mofina has the ability to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout this mystery about tragic loss and heartbreak and the mystery that surrounds this accident. I highly recommend this novel.
1,Don't waste your money.,"Don't waste your money. You can get the same info by doing a search of mold illness symptoms. There was no new info in this book and the title is deceptive. You will not learn how to detox from mold exposure or how to effectively remove it from your home. All of the info found in this book could have been to put into one chapter titled, ""Possible mold illness symtoms and how to pick a remediator""."
1,Disappointed,I found more information online researching mold and mold remediation than I did in reviewing this book. It was too basic and did not provide much help. I would not recommend it.
1,This product is useless,I've been on this for almost 4 months and have NOT noticed ANY changes in my condition what so ever. I followed the directions as indicated and it has helped me in the least. Therefore I give this product a ZERO star rating. What a waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Why a Preservative?,"Why are methyl paraben and propyl paraben used as preservatives? Aren't homeopathic remedies usually preserved with alcohol?The directions don't say to put the remedy under the tongue. Why not?It might be a good product, but I don't plan to order anymore.How homeopathic is this?"
5,It Works!,I am only been using this product for about two weeks. Already noticed a big difference in my skin. Almost all of the redness is gone around my chest area and my elbow is almost completely cleared up. My scalp is no longer red and itchy as well. I will definitely be buying this again.Only wish they would do something about the taste. The taste is horrible but I put about 4 drops of cinnamin oil in the bottle and that helps. Though next time I am only going to use 2 drops. It taste like those red hot candies now.
1,Did Not Work,"I was SO hoping that this would do the trick. I took it religiously as instructed and would have been happy for just a placebo effect, but I didn't even get that. After three months, nothing had changed. If there had been even the slightest sign of improvement, I would have purchased three more bottles, but I won't be buying any more. It didn't work for me and I can't imagine WHO it WOULD work for."
5,The only psoriasis medication to use,"This is the only product that has had any significant positive results with my psoriasis. If nothing else works for you then try this product. Only 1 or 2 teaspoons depending on weight in the morning before breakfast and that's it. I had significant results in only four weeks. The scaly, flaky skin and redness subsided by at least 80%. It's worth the $30 if only to try it out. Good luck!"
2,Review,"The femgest cream seems to work as good as other progesterone creams. However, it is much to thick and does not absorb well. I ended up using more for the same effect as other creams. I would not rec. this product."
4,Internal inferno,My hot flashes seem to be getting worse and I really don't want to go on HRT. I remember a friend of mine had used progesterone cream and swore by it so thought I would give it a try. It seems to be helping to calm the fire I deal with especially at night. I hope it will keep things in check as I continue my journey through this phase of life so at this point I am satisfied with the product.
3,Femgest Cream Review,"I expected to sleep better, increase my sex drive, lose belly fat. Using femgest cream did nothing to help these symtoms. So I don't know what it did for me. I stopped using it. I wouldn't mind someone responding with what it is doing for me. Would really like to find a product that would ease the above symtoms."
