2,Uneventful,"Made a major heroic event into an uneventful tale of a hodgepodge of individuals and families whose identities get blurred and forgotten as the story/non-story evolves/devolves. Not nearly enough information about what the reader bought the book for in the first place, ie: the facts and nuts and bolts about what happened during that tragic/heroic/fateful day.The end was as anticlimactic as it possibly could be. Simply did not answer the questions I had and did not do the event justice."
5,"Excellent, heart wrenching",This book is a great story of the timeline of events that took place involving the passengers and crew aboard flight 93. It breaks your heart and gives you goosebumps. It's a great tribute to those who lost their lives on that flight. It will make you proud to be an American.
5,very moving,"a tribute to heroes, indeed. this book exemplifies the courage shown by 40+ heroic americans on that fateful day in September. From the biographing to the memoralizing, this book shows what happened at the first battlefield of the war on terrorism. God Bless America."
4,Very Touching,This book is a very touching and emotional. It brings you close to many of the passengers of Flight 93 and who they were. It also puts you in their place on the plane that fateful day.
4,Great Show,"One of the few network TV shows I can stomach. The cast has great chemistry. The stories are generally interesting well thought out with surprising plot twists and ethical dilemmas for the characters. This program also delves into island cultural issues in a challenging manner.Lastly, the technical aspects of the shows production are superb. The crew makes excellent use of the islands settings and the visual effects and editing are world class. The car stunts and driving are particularly impressive.The only thing that regularly annoys me is the removal of manufacturer emblems from cars. I get that Chevy is a sponsor, but taking the badge off a BMW or the Pony from a Mustang grill is stupid and distracting."
2,gore,"My favorite show. Great plots, setting. EXCELLENT ACTING. Writing this season has gone over the top for Gore. I really don't need to see the blood- caked head repeatedly. My wife and son now refuse to watch future episodes with me. Thank you very little."
2,"compared to the Classic Five-O, this show stinks!","am a fan of the original five-0 and this show is a joke to the standards of the old show of the 1970's. The old series had no lingering story lines but for Wo Fat, each episode was a stand alone gem. The men of Five-o dressed in suits and were classy, these new guys dress like bums, like they just walked into a bar on a Friday night. The musical score in the new series is loud, over the top and often just out of place with the content of the scenes. The editing is fast in your face, made for a child with ADD. The actors all look pretty much the same, no great character distinctions here. This new show is just bad."
2,Hawaii 5-0,It was hard for me to follow. I'm not familiar yet with the actors. Not sure who the bad guys were.There was plenty of action though. Maybe too much for one episode.
2,couldn't watch it,"I live in Hawaii. Family has been around here awhile. This show misses the entire beat of the islands, instead focusing on a Hollywoodization that trivializes the real issues and excitement inherent in the place and replaces them with worn out tropes aimed at hitting the tweener neener market. It's sad, because the place is actually far more interesting than the show implies."
3,Action packed series nice scenery but......,"This is a show that is full of action and a lot of eye candy but I certainly would not want McGarrett and his team operating in my state. It is one thing to get the job done and another to run rough shod and break the law to do it. This series is a good example of law officers given to much authority. While in this particular show as in others the Five-O team take down some bad people I find they continually bend or break the law and run rough shod to do it. Kind of a underlying theme of the end justifies the means. So while this makes for exciting viewing and this series make the Five-O team look like cool super heroes in reality you do not want these kind of cops in your state, city or town because they cause more harm than good."
5,What's not to love?,"For those viewers who appreciate a well-written, well-cast, well-acted, well-directed, etc. series, Hawaii Five-O is the show to watch. There's action, character development, mystery, comedy, and the best stunts ever in this wonderful series - and let's not forget that it's filmed in the paradise of Hawaii."
5,Great remake,This has become my favorite series on TV. Love the acting and musical scoring! I am old enough to remember the original series; this is much more fast paced!
1,"Good Cast, Poor Writing, Defies Logic Then Tried to Get Political","This was a show I really wanted to succeed since I really liked the cast but poor writing, really impossible situations that were never explained and then the Pro-Gun Control rant (which served no purpose for the show) just ended it for me. When you allow poor writers to inject their political views into a script for no reason other than letting them air their political tendencies I give up! Maybe they should bring back Moonlight since this show may survive this season but in the long run it is gone."
4,Gotta like the characters and the locale...,"...but on occasion the credibility of some plot twists stretches the imagination. Still, can't beat the banter between McGarrett and Dano. And the supporting cast is great."
4,A great Roy Rogers film,"This is a really fun Roy film. Its one of his rare historically set movies and has a good script, good production values and a top supporting cast. If you are'nt into the more musical and modern Roy movies you will like this one."
5,DOPE! Nothing more or less...,"Track Listing:1. KALIFORNIA (4:34)2. ASHES TO ASHES, DUST TO DUST (4:43)3. PIMP CLINIC ANTHEM (5:27)4. KALIFORNIA (INSTRUMENTAL) (4:36)5. ASHES TO ASHES, DUST TO DUST (INSTRUMENTAL) (4:45)6. PIMP CLINIC ANTHEM (INSTRUMENTAL) (5:24)"
2,Read only if required by your professor!,"This is a fairly intractable philosophical examination of the questions: what defines a legal system, what provides a legal system with legitimacy, and what are the origins of law.The author is inexcusably verbose and convoluted in discussing these otherwise interesting and important questions. If your professor has assigned this book, well, you have no choice. Otherwise, I'd recommend curling up with verbatim copies of the U.S. Constitution, The Declaration of Independence, The Federalist Papers and/or the Magna Carta, as more productive & fascinating ways to spend hours contemplating the history and meaning of the law."
1,Stay away from these!,"Built a new house and these were installed. Have fought ""false alarms"" for two years now. Every excuse in the book from bugs in the system to power surges from the power company. I removed the alarms from the garage. Contacted the power company. No other neighbors alarms go off. Even with the garage units removed, periodically these units just go off.I am replacing them all tomorrow."
4,Kidde 1275 in Louisiana,"This product was in my house when I bought it and obviously is still there today. It works great and has never given me the problems it has been reported to give others. If you are expecting any smoke detector to be maintenance-free it would be best to resort to your nose. Otherwise, this product, like others, is not without some minor maintenance issues. I have only had to replace one. The house is six years old and has 7 installed. By the way, the reason I had to replace one was the previous owner removed the detector and I could not find it when I moved in. Follow the manufacture's recommendation and you will be fine."
1,Great product if you like false alarms at 3am.,"Same problem as everyone else. Installed them as a replacements for old alarms. After a couple of months starting getting false alarms on two different alarms. Called the 800 number and was told that the alarms had dust or bugs in them and to clean them. I told her I never had problems like this with the old ones and I had read a bunch of negative reviews on the internet. Her responce was that they were not responisible for dirt or bugs. Good old ""Not our fault"" customer service.NOT RECOMMENDED. (Unless you like false alarms)"
1,piece of junk,"I am writing this at 2am because I could not figure out how to shut off the stupid smoke alarms without pulling it out of the ceiling and removing the battery. I cannot find the manual, and I cannot find one online. The alarm went off and there is no fire, no dust, no apparent reason for waking us all up in the middle of the night. Tomorrow I will look for a new smoke alarm."
1,12:30 am and alarm with no reason,"Just like the other posters, I change battereies without fail and have twice since I owned these been woken by an alarm without reason. Simply maddening."
1,Goes off for no reason,"Piece of junk. It goes off for no reason, but only in the middle of the night."
1,Things that CHIRP in the night...,"I too have been suddenly awakened in the middle of the night several times now by the frightening sound of a fire alarm. I cannot pinpoint which one is the culprit as it has been a different unit on two of three occasions. We all know the story of the boy who cried wolf, right? Well, lets just say I will be replacing all three alarms that are less than one year old with three new ones from a different manufacturer. Good night and sleep well..."
2,They discolor after years of use,I agree with all of the other reviews. One thing that bugs me is how the plastic cover discolors after years of use. This appears to be caused by indirect sunlight. I do not know if this is unique to this smoke detector or this happens to all plastic units. This is obviously not the most important criterion when selecting a smoke alarm.
3,"Well, it actually does go off","This alarm system saved my house from flooding. A pipe burst and shorted one of the units, so they all went off. That woke me up and I was able to shut the water off. Without the networked system I never would have known. They are difficult to shut off- you must unplug them from the AC power source. Only 3 stars because of how annoying they are."
1,Problems with the Kidde 1275,My Kidde 1275 fire alarms are chirpers. I replaced the batteries on all my upstairs alarms and they kept chirping. Can't find the owners manual. The instructions on the back of the alarm do not cover the problem of continual chirping after battery replacement. The alarm is quite difficult to replace once you have detached it from the ceiling. I'd like to see the winner who designed this thing. You even have to turn it counter clockwise (backwards) in order to re-attach to the ceiling. I suspect many people just get rid of theirs and live in peace.
2,Flakey Gizmos,"Bought a 6 pack of these when we painted the house. Within 18 months, we were having false alarms that always seemed to happen at 3:00 AM. A couple of the alarms are on vaulted ceilings and are a pain to get to. Bought individual ones to replace the bad ones and so far so good. Religiously replacing the batteries every October. Also had the reset problem but figured it out. Bottom line, these are cheap smoke detectors and operate that way,"
1,Yet another false alarm review,"So, here I am at 03:34 AM writing a review for a smoke detector. Why you may ask, well if you have read other reviews on this product you will realize that it is because a false alarm has awoken me for the second night in a row. The first night we thought it was a battery issue but even after changing it continues to chirp. This second we just unplugged it and will be getting a new one tomorrow as this is ridiculous.Please, if you are even remotely considering this model, do you self a favor and get something else. Your family may not thank you, but at least they wont be plotting to kill you after a second night of false alarms in a row."
1,Does Kidde Have Any Conscience?,"People can't possibly still be buying these things, can they? I too find it supernatural that the chirping chorus occurs during sleep hours. My wife is concerned I'm going to have a heartattack as I drag the ladder out at 3A using every curse word I know. Change the battery, still chirps! Push the button and have the high decibel screech drive my trembling dog to the farthest corner of the house. Still chirps! If not for code restrictions I'd pull them all out and take my chances on a fire."
1,Maddening!,No way to describe the maddening noise these make! I just tried to change a battery to eliminate the chirping.....now they all are going off and the one with the new battery can't be plugged back in without all of them going off.I am tired of the 1:30am and 3:00am false alarms (multiple times).This item should never have been released.
1,2:30 and 3 am false alarms,We have had false alarms 4 to 5 false alarms over the years and last night we had 2 - 2:30 am and again at 3 am. I came online to trouble shoot only to realize that it is a product problem. I hate them (the whole family hates them) and will be looking for a new product to replace them with.
1,3:30 am Wake-Up Call,"Seems that 3am false alarms are the norm for this product. After almost having a heart attack at 3:30a, when two of the alarms went off in my house for no reason, I had a hard time falling back asleep, for fear of the alarms going off, again. I thought something was wrong with the battery or the wiring in my house, but reading the numerous reviews on this particular alarm let me know that I simply have a sorry alarm system and will be purchasing some new units for my home, this weekend. Nice..."
1,Would rate it ZERO stars if I could!!!,"I have 5 of those suckers around my house, and I got one instance of false alarms every year. Last night two of them did it 3 times in total: 12:40AM, 1:40 Am and 2:40 AM!! The firefighters were here twice and even with their professional detector they were not able to figure out any reading of potentially harmful smoke/gas at all. So at the last time I ripped the bitching one off the ceiling and finally got a good 4 hours of sleep... Darn those darn units!! Stay away from this product, if you've already got them in your house, get rid of them ASAP! You know it will catch you either today or tomorrow!!!"
3,Kim Shults,"The same thing happened to me!! Here I am - on the computer at 6am because the stupid alarm went off and I couldn't figure out how to get it to stop. I thought I got it to stop, but then it went off again. I changed the battery in 1 of them (the only one I could reach without a ladder!) Uh oh! There it goes again!!!!! Please stop! The funny thing is - that my 2 boys ages 7 and 9 are sleeping through this!!! Not a good sign!!!"
1,False Alarms are not the problem.,"Yeah we had a few times when the alarms did go off at 2 or 3 in the morn with no idea why. But tonight takes the cake, we just got back from a small vacation and about 20 min ago we heard a poping noise in our bed room while watching tv. Next we smell an electrical fire/smoke smell and we see smoke spewing from the smoke alarm unit. Next thing we know all the units are humming away. I was quick to remove the unit and disconnect it from the main line and carried it out to my garage with it still humming away. The unit really stunk and was really hot. I dont know what the heck is going on here but I did find the owners manual and install manual on line. It does state that the Manufacture warranty's this unit for up to six years. Our house was built four years ago. Just wanted you all to know this bit of info."
1,"Wake Up! - Wake Up! - No fire, but it's 3AM! - Wake Up!","I too had these units go off all over our house at 3AM and then again a minute later. I ran around and found one unit with a blinking green light, so I pressed the test button and it didn't sound off again ..... until the *next* morning at 5AM. I again pressed the test button and went back to bed. Later that day I replaced the battery (which is still good, by the way). It hasn't sounded off again for a couple of days, but now I'm skittish in the wee morning hours. Get a different detector."
1,chirp chirp chirp,"Existing good battery, new battery, nothing stops the chirping. My Jack Russell terrier is fed up! I'll be purchasing a different brand to replace my Lifesaver model 1275 smoke alarm."
2,How well does a Kidde do at 85-0 MPH?,This stupid thing went off this morning and I couldnt get it to turn off...I waved a towel in front of it several times...turned on the AC. It finally turned off when it hit the concrete floor of my kitchen at about 85 mph. good news is that Kidde will take care of the unit for you...no return of original unit is required.
2,1275 ELEC SMOKE ALM W/BATTERY,"Good service from this vendor, but I later discovered this exact product at a big chain home improvement center for about half the price. The smoke alarm works well (sometimes too well), but the design of the plug is weak. It is difficult to plug into (and unplug from) the ceiling. The plastic plug can easily break in the struggle. I chose this model only because it replaces a damaged one that came with the house. If possible, try another brand or model, and do a little price comparison with the local home improvement center."
2,mad chirping,"this product is the obsolute worst and it took me six years to discover this. we bought our house brand new and it was already equipped with this smoke alarm system. when the chirping started about several months ago we didn't have a clue (and still don't) on how to stop it. there was no manual or instruction left. its electric and I don't know how to get to the battery. i can't believe they put these smoke alarms in new houses without a manual. after viewing all the negative reviews and seeing that the product is discontinued, we will probably have to replace all of smoke alarms in our house. there's one in every room. how can a company provide a product with no instrutions to service it."
2,A/C connector challenges for this smoke alarm,"From reading some of the other reviews of this product, I can see I'm not alone! And of course whoever installed this alarm did not leave the manual, and I couldn't find it on line either!Of course the low battery chirping started early morning - and I tried till my fingers went numb to disconnect the A/C clip to get at the battery compartment - and couldn't get it out -so it chirped all day till I returned from work, and spent more time with it - finally had to dig out my pliers to grab ahold of the clip and was finally able to get it out and changed the battery - what a POOR design!So - keep your pliers handy for the next time you need to change the battery!"
1,What's So Special About 3AM???,"I am floored to see so many reviews with the 3AM false alarms/chirping!!! How scary is that?!! This too happened to us at 3AM this morning. Our home is less than a year old and these were installed when the home was built. I've called the builder and told him that these smoke alarms are JUNK, and I will be faxing him this list of reviews. We will be replacing all of these alarms with ""real"" smoke alarms. I wish I could give this product -666 stars because surely it's possessed."
2,drag the designer into the street to be shot at sunrise,"same as everyone else, I'm afraid. These things stink! I think the designer spends too much time sitting around in plaid pajamas with his thumb in inappropriate places. These things go off periodically for absolutely no reason. The wiring harness is too hard to take off the blasted thing, and shut it up. I really don't have a yearning to wake up in the night to its shrieks and shrill cries."
1,Thank Goodness I'm not alone in this!,"Good to know this is a problem with others as well! My husband and I were awakened a week ago to the alarms all going off @ 3 AM. We never could figure out what happened and thought maybe it was a power surge. Then last night, at the same time, it occurred again. Only this time, an hour later it again went off and then again another 10 minutes later. Our solution: temporarily turn off the suckers @ the electrial box AND remove the batteries. We air-blasted and shook the one that was the culprit and a TINY spider dropped out. It was miniscule!! We have since cleaned ALL of the detectors AND once again replaced the batteries. Based on the other descriptions I am NOT holding out hope. It is worth my sanity to replace them all. I hope the manufacturer reads all of these reviews!!!!"
1,poor unit,I had a unit go off every 10 minutes in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. Had to pull the unit and remove the battery.
1,Poor quality of materials,"Aside from discoloration of the plastic shell after a few years of use, I have several of these alarms that spontaneously broke loose from the ceiling simply due to the force of gravity. It appears the plastic is of inferior quality."
1,Harrassing Beeper,Have six of these in my townhouse and at least two have gone crazy. Random alarms going off at anytime day or night. Replaced batteries and no change. The house is only 18 months old and these came with the home. They are a nightmare. I am looking for a better compatible model to replace them with.
1,Fire Safety NOT,"I had one of these chirping all the time, I thought I had a faulty wiring. After replacing the unit the chirping stopped. And I had to be overseas in Europe for about 5 months. After I left my neighbor called me and said all the smoke alarms were going off in my house. False Alarm ! Luckily I had left a key with him so he had to go in and drag the ladder from the garage and remove all of them since I have high ceilings. Well that stopped the blaring noise which woke up the whole neighborhood but unlucky for me when I got home, he had forgotten my garage lights on which burned lots of watts for 5 months ! So to make a long story short, stay away from this Piece of Junk...."
1,"Undisclosed feature, the 3am alarm clock included in every one.","OMG, I can't believe everyone else has the 3am problem, worse yet it follows the 3am with daylight savings. Too bad this can't go off at 3am somewhere in the European time zone. We recently moved into this house with a ton of these useless firealarms installed. Stay away from this one. The only thing this is good for is if you need extra skeet shooting discs, cuz that is what I want to do with these things, destroy them."
1,I hate these things,"I have tried everything that was suggested on these reviews. I cleaned it out, I discharged for 10 seconds all the energy while the battery was out, and the battery is brand new. It still chirps! I even checked out the wires. I will have to go and purchase a whole different brand I guess."
5,Kind of makes you feel like you were in KISS,"I read a book by Gene Simmons called KISS AND TELL. I also read a book about KISS called BEHIND THE MASK. After reading KISS FOREVER I noticed something strange happening to my way of thinking in regards to KISS. Before reading these three books I used to think of KISS the way I always had. What songs I liked, which album covers were the best, which costumes were best, ect. After reading this book (and the other two) I know so much about the day to day lives of KISS during the 70s and 80s that now I feel more like I was a member of KISS remembering my days with the band than a fan. As I read this I found it easy to imagine what it would have been like to have been a member of KISS. The book states when someone was sick, when their pants split on stage, when they did store appearances, ect. If you're a KISS fan you should have this book. I was worried I was wasting my money on a book that I wouldn't find interesting but I was wrong. Its a great book."
4,Extremely useful guide.,"An extremely useful guide. We managed to followed most of the tours in the Bavaria region and picked up on some along the Romantic Road. These tours take you both on and off the beaten track, with recommended stops etc, whilst avoiding heavy traffic. I believe that without this guide we would have missed many of the smaller off the beaten track areas, which made the trip so much more enjoyable."
3,Nice....at first....,"My husband practically lives in this robe. It is very heavy and plush, which is nice. However, it's white...so if your hubbie tends to sweat, or well...just be a man, it will yellow over time. Plus it shrinks in the wash."
2,Not as it appears,"Similar to another reviewer, from the appearance I expected this to be a right-angle driver that would allow me access screws in tight spaces by turning the end, without having to ratchet the driver side-to-side. This is not the case, very disappointed."
4,Great voiced singer,"I own about 1000 cd's of which 300+ are lady vocalists including O'day, Christie, Peggie Lee,Vaughn, McRae, and on and on. I don't want any prospective buyer of Bev Kelly's efforts to be dissuaded from missing out on a thoroughly enjoyable voice. She stacks up with any of the aforementioned singers. I'm very sorry that her career ended with only the few cd's that are available for me to enjoy."
2,Small voiced jazz singer...,"If Marilyn Monroe did a vocal album with jazz backing, she would have done a better job then the awful Bev Kelly, who makes the talented but vocally limited Blossom Dearie sound like Sarah Vaughan. On this CD of pleasant satndards backed by a good jazz combo, Kelly whispers in her warbly Jeri Southern like voice(Jeri Southern has a good voice, but small), trying to be a jazz singer but talking her way through lyrics in-effectively. This CD is not recommended."
4,it is face to face,This elbum is an exelent album and I would recomend it to any Face To Face fan out there. It is clasic Face To Face at its best and really catchy. If you haven't ever bought a Face To Face album start wit this and you WILL buy all of there other albums. So out of a 1-10 scale I would give this album a 9 because it is a good album and you will listen to it all the time.
4,STRONG MOVE TO THE POST!,"Let's face it, Wayman Tisdale was not the greatest power forward in the NBA and only a handful of NBA fan's outside of the Sacramento area probably even remember him. Therefore, unlike Shaq who sells worthless CD's on his name recognition alone, Wayman has had to prove his worth to music fans all over the world. On ""Face to Face"" Tisdale proves his worth by writing 6 of the 10 songs on the CD in addition to playing some very nice smooth Jazz on his bass. One thing Tisdale has obviously learned as a player is that any modicum of success depends in large part on the team you are playing with. With that understanding, Tisdale has surrounded himself with many fine, talented players. This winning team has helped Tisdale produce a championship quality CD."
5,very good book to start with,I advise anyone young who is seriously interested in horses to start with this book. I've been riding all my life and think this is a great book to start with and it is very informative.
4,Highly recommended,"This book by Daniel Riffe et al. not only gives an excellent overview of the research field of quantitative content analysis, but also useful recommendations on solving that particular analysis or measurement problem that you are facing. Using this book, I found it much easier to quantitatively measure structured interview results. The examples given in the book are often from the media world, but are generally applicable. Recommended."
4,Terific instrutional Video,This video was very informative and explicite in detailing intimate and erotic shaving. My wife and I found it to be not only educational but also very exciting.
1,Lewis and Clark are rolling in their graves,"Lewis and Clark are rolling in their graves at this movie. It bares almost no resemblance to the actual trip. It would take too long to list all the factual mistakes. In addition, 3 pretty good actors gave the worst performances of their careers. Watch this only if you want a good laugh."
2,Lewis and Clark romanticized....,"It is quite interesting to view an old Hollywood version of the corps of discovery.The historical truth is far from being respected, the Native Americans speak beautiful english, Lewis and Clark are rival lovers...still, the film is worth viewing if you want to compare the story line with that of the real trail blazer's story."
5,bad ass,this is just one of the greats animes I've ever seen from the very beginning with the awesome (Dragoball) to the to the equally awesome (Dragonball Z) YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THESE AMINES!!!!
5,Great purchase! Great price!,"As usual I was able to find this cheaper on Amazon than any other retailer, and it came in the condition described!"
4,Would've bought it,"Want this, I have the first 4. But all the seasons were $16 on here when I first started buying them, closer to Christmas they went down to $13, then immediately after Christmas they went up to $25. I will not buy them until they go back down. I am also boycotting Amazon right now anyway, because of the disgusting books they are selling/supporting."
5,Neat,This was a gift and the child I got it for loves it. That's all that matters is that he is happy and it makes it all worth it :D
5,second of my favorite saga's,"like what everyone else says. I can't wait till this set comes out.I already have it ordered. i'll do that with all of them.okay the first favorite saga is the freiza saga. ( reason why ) well it has to be the episode (Transformed at last) that is a emotional episode, losing a friend right in front of you. man that's is my favorite part when Goku becomes a SUPER SAIYAN for the first time. But that's not the full reason. this set has the best fight scenes in it.All Z warriors are my favorite. but my #1 favorite character has to be GOKU!. went through all transformations minus the mystic saiyan.enough of that.dragonball z by far the best anime series watched on TV.I'm wandering if thier going to do the same with the original dragonball series?"
3,3 episodes per disc,"this season set is as good as the previous sets as far as quality and audio are concerned, but there is one big difference. Funimation go back to their money grubbing ways and from discs 4-6 only add 3 episodes per disc rather then 6. it's still a lot better then 3 eps per single DVD of course but I can imagine Funimation will drag this series out as long as possible. could be a sign of things to come, I wouldn't be surprised to see only 2-3 eps per disc in the next set..."
4,What I was expecting.,"My biggest problem with this set is that they felt the need to spread 26 episodes over six discs. Five would have been enough. The last three discs only contain three episodes on each, which isn't really that big a deal, but it kind of puts a damper on marathon viewing.I was also a bit disappointed to see that, like season 4, the dub had barely been altered. I don't really have a problem with the voice-actors themselves, my main beef is the dialogue. To put it bluntly, it's terrible. Full of cringe-inducing lines that may amuse younger audiences, but not older fans.Those few minor grievances aside, this is another great installment in the series, and I can't wait for the next one."
5,Pride crushing results,"This is the season where Vegeta and Trunks both become ascended super saiyans. I'm a huge dbz fan, so just about anything dbz has my approval. I would recommend this to any dbz fan."
5,Impetus for Thought,"If you truly believe that questioning the ultimate motives for war is unpatriotic, then do not read this book. If you have the courage to accept there actually are two sides to every story, then this book is for you. The previous review takes quotes from this book entirely out of context ... whether you agree or not, this book does actually warrant investigation."
5,Wonderful prayers to accompany saying the Rosary,"This book has excellent scriptural excepts to accompany the Rosary. Very easy to hold in one hand while holding the Rosary in the other. The brief prayers can easily and quietly be said in a public rosary setting while the first half of the Our Father or Hail Mary is being recited. These scriptural prayers are good meditation tools which combine a focus on the mystery of each decade in conjuction with the prayer for the Holy Souls. A great combination of prayers. The author also has a ""Thirty-Day Devotion for the Holy Souls"" which I recommend as a companion for daily prayer and meditation."
2,Cheap price and quality,"My friends and I bought this bag seeing the low price and the glorious 100 liter space. The load balancers broke for one of them at the start of the trek and another broke for another bag while returning back.Also the bag bites into the neck and is uncomfortable and you are forced to look at the ground while walking, unless you cut off the handle grip which is what I did.Overall it is poor design and suggested for cheap low weight baggages only."
4,Esoteric topic but I enjoyed it,"I've read a lot of history and a lot of historical fiction on Rome. If you're not the bookish type who likes to really dig into the details of a historical era, or if you're not fairly familiar with the people and events of Caesar's time, this would have to be one of the most colossally dull books you've ever read. But I am both, and I found it very enjoyable and easy to read. It helped to crystallize and clarify a lot of other things I've read."
3,The head is really BIG!,"Good quality brush but I didn't realize how big the head was. You can't really wash cups or glasses with this but it's great on big items such as pots, pans, plates etc."
5,Out standing,This was expertly told. It took me to the next to last chapter to figure out who the killer was. This is one of the best mysteries I have enjoyed. Anyone who loves mysteries will enjoy this book.
3,Quirky historical mystery,"Blunt Instrument was my first Georgette Heyer mystery. I love mysteries set in historical UK. The characters were quirky and quite strong at times - it was like listening to a person taking too long to tell a joke - where I kept thinking ok, ok I get the point, just get on with the mystery.The mystery itself was fairly predictable from an analytical standpoint. Ignore the red herrings and look at the evidence.I was on vacation and bought several of her books while I had the chance. Hopefully the rest are better. Should you read it? Why not? If you like a mystery set in the days of olden UK, then give it a shot."
3,It's time we reached a thrilling climax,"I love Georgette Heyer. Her Regency romances set the standard that every other author falls short of and her mysteries are absorbing and entertaining. A Blunt Instrument didn't quite measure up to other Heyer mysteries I've read, though. It has a light and frothy feel--as airy as a 1930s drawing-room comedy from MGM at times--and some truly comical moments. But for me, an improbable romance and the strange solution to the mystery detracted from the overall effect. I still enjoyed it--and even mediocre Georgette Heyer is better than most authors ever achieve--but I've read better from her."
3,A Bash on the Head,"""A Blunt Instrument"" is below the style expected of Ms. Heyer. Too many characters have a reason to kill Ernest Fletcher, a ladies man drawn to the fine line of repulsive, it makes a modern reader wonder why any woman would get within fifty feet of him.The best lines are among Superintendent Hannasyde and Sargent Hemmingway as they plot the crime and its execution with a Biblical quoting local policeman who discovered the body. Other exchanges between characters seemed contrived and uncomfortable.A good read, but not one of her best, which includes an interesting romance.Nash Black, author of ""Qualifying Laps"" and ""Sins of the Fathers."""
3,Predictable,"I was able to guess the murderer from the start and I spent the rest of the book hoping I was wrong. Should I be proud of myself or disappointed because it was too obvious? I still enjoyed the book, but the mystery wasn't really a mystery to me. The characters of Neville Fletcher and Sally Drew were amusing but I actually enjoyed Sergeant Hemingway and his slight bitterness the most. I've read enough of Heyer's detective novels now to where I know there is a romance in each of them so it doesn't surprise me anymore. This one did feel a bit tacked on, but still cute nonetheless."
5,To the point...,"This book is ""just the facts"" without the hyperbole and sermonizing that so many ""debunking"" authors relish indulging in. Kusche was the first to systematically and methodically study many of the ""Bermuda Triangle"" mysteries and his hard work is often cited in many publications and televised programs with no credit going to Kusche. If more Paranormal investigators took this much time and effort to substantiate their facts I suspect many more ""mysteries"" would be solved."
4,"factual and solid, not for sensation seekers","Oscar Wilde said that books of history that are not full of lies are boring. Well, this book is the result of careful investigation. It does not set out to debunk anything but to get the facts. They do largely debunk the much more interesting sensationalism of the Bermuda-Triangle nonsense, but when the facts do not allow for an explanation, the book says so. (The implication remains that ""unexplained"" does not mean ""mysterious"" or ""preter-natural""."
4,"Oh, the conspiracy theorists will hate this!","Kusche does a fairly well-detailed book, chronicling the best-known of the ""mysteries"" dealing with the Bermuda Triangle. It's a decent list, and it is essentially a debunker's textbook.He offers a lot of information conveniently left out about a lot of the disappearances in other books, and puts a good deal of detail into why a lot of these disappearances occurred.It really makes these all seem rather mundane. For example, the loss of the British training ship ""Atalanta"" is a disaster waiting to happen, i.e., bad handling, a bad storm, too few real sailors and a lot of seasick, scared cadets.Good stuff if you're interested, and are willing to read with an open, unjaundiced eye."
1,Intentionally deceptive,"This is one of the classic ""debunking"" books of all time. The trouble is that the author avoids the truly mystifying and well, lies.Don't believe me. Google the author and the book before buying. To those of you who NEED for there to be an easy answer it won't matter, you'll buy this book anyway."
2,Visually appealing but not very informative!,"This was a beautifully done book with wonderful pictures! The major problem I found with it is that it only covered four or five of the major brands of collectible kitchen ceramics. I ordered it under the impression that it covered a vast range of kitchen ceramics. What proved to be even more disappointing was that there was no price guide! I guess if you're an experienced collector of yellowware, redware, ironstone, etc. this would be a great book. For a novice such as myself, it proved to be relatively useless."
4,Potter's Reference,I found this book at the library and studied the ceramic forms in it so many times(and paid enough late fees on it) that I decided I probably needed a copy.It's a good reference book for a potter even if it's different from what you produce. It's loaded with visual information.I love the intro pictures of the 19th century English potteries.
4,A must for the ambitious student,"I finally got my hands on this book - and it was well worth the wait. The book is a huge inspiration and if you get the cassette that accompanies it you're in for a treat: Theres so much genuine flamenco in these pages! I know a guy who quit the Music Conservatory to go to Spain and look up Paco Pena! -And he actually gave him a couple of lessons! If you're not that devoted (and Paco probably don't give lessons to just anyone these days), this book will do almost just as well!"
2,far too basic,"Thsi volume is far too basic to be of much use beyond a first year Bible college class. For the seminary student or pastor looking for a good reference tool, there are much better New Testament introductions and surveys available. This added nothing to my study of the New Testament."
4,OUT OF PRINT AS A SINGLE,"THIS IS AVAILABLE IN THE DIZZY GILLESPIE SMALL GROUP SESSIONS BOXED SET. THE SESSIONS WITH ROLLINS AND STITT ARE NOT INCLUDED. DIZZY GILLESPIE-THE COPENHAGEN CONCERT IS WITH THE GROUP WITH LEO WRIGHT. ""AN ELECTRFYING EVENING WITH DIZZY GILLESPIE"" IS BOTH IN THE BOX SET AND AVAILABLE INDIVIDUALLY"" PARIS JAZZ CONCERT 1960"" IS NOT IN THE BOX SET. BOTH FEATURE THE ALTO SAX AND FLUTE OF LEO WRIGHT."
5,Dizzy on the French Riviera,"This cd is one of my all time favorites.Iwas very surprised that you had it on a cd.Its very old,but never out of style. Glad you had it and very glad that I bought it. Thanks!!"
4,Stand Up & Testify,"Stand Up & Testify being Popsicle's 1997 release and was their 5th and final studio album to date. The album contained such singles as ""Dry Spot"", ""The Price We Pay"", ""The Sweetest Relief"" and ""That was Summer"". I must say that this album was a very pleasent surprise and it is definitely an record that I would recommend. 4/5."
2,Painfully verbose and weak on content,"I expected much from this title, with the promise of being a mixture of Newton's biographical history and of his scientific methods. What is actually presented is a way too descriptive and subjective analysis of Newton's life and habits, with not much in depth discussion of Newton's mathematical and experimental innovations. Only until the appendix does the excellent 'Tour of Calculus' type of format make an appearance. A better outline of Newton's scientific methods can be found in Morris Kline's ""Mathematics of the Physical World"" from Dover books, and there are most certainly better Newton biographies out there. Disappointing."
3,School project review,"David Berlinski's portrayal of Isaac Newton is very informative. In his note to the reader Berlinski explains that the goal of his retelling of Newton's story is to give the reader a sense of Newton without becoming tedious and getting caught up in the mundane. This book sheds light onto influential factors in Newton's career and the adversity that he had to overcome within the scientific community. The math explaining Newton's concepts and conclusions about science is relatively simple and easy to understand for people who don't have a doctorate in physics, which is quite welcome to the average person. Berlinski also endeavors into Newton's personal life as well as his close friendships and bitter rivals. These personal interactions shed some light as to Newton's temperament and personality quirks that succeed in Berlinski's goal to inform the reader about Newton, not just Newton's ideas and discoveries. All in all a good read."
2,This Book in NOT a Gift,"Mr. Berlinski got 2 stars for teaching a little math and dropping hints on Newton's life. He also would like to have you understand that despite Newton's ability to read religious Greek, Latin, and Hebrew biblical sources, he was 'confused' about Christianity and embraced the Arian heresy. Was this a book on Newton's gifts, or Berlinski's religious beliefs? The book is mostly filler on a few biographical tidbits. Take Berlinski's advice: read ""Never at Rest"" by Richard Westphall instead."
4,Pretty standard fan,"It's a good fan for the price... the snap on legs to help it stand up really don't last, so it helps to be able to lean it against something."
1,quit working,this is one of the few items I have ever has to return. The fan stopped working just after two days. I did get a prompt refund from amazon.
3,not the fan shown on the website,"I just received this fan and have unpacked it and turned it on.It works OK and is 3-speed as advertized BUT it is not the fan shown inthe photo on the Amazon website. I paid $25 for the fan and it appears tobe a 'standard $20 box fan"". I had expected to receive something a bit better than what has arrived. I will keep it, but I am disappointed."
5,Lasko Makes a Great Box Fan!,"Nice to see Made in the USA on the outside of the Lasko 20"" box the fan arrived in!Delivery was before scheduled and caught me and my two cats by suprize! Cats have nice new box to play with and I have great smooth operating and quiet cooling Lasko 20"" box fan just the right size for my apartment. If you run it on the highest speed naturally it is a little louder. This fan delivers the goods,goods in this case being circulating cool air. Appreciate the prompt delivery also. You may wonder why the early review since having the fan only a couple hours,well the reason is I trust Lasko for a good product since my previous fan was a Lasko I have used for the last 10 years! Motor just wore out after good work for 10 years. Thanks Lasko!"
4,Inefficient but good for the price.,"The thing comes cheap but it has very small blades which means not as much air comes out plus they smack the air so it's louder. I have to imagine that there's some sort of design flaw that makes it so it has to be this way, but it's a great product none the less. It blows air in your face, therefore 4 stars."
2,"20"" BOX FAN","BUYER BEWARE!!!!I bought a 2 pack of these. When the fans arrived the grills on the fans had obviously been stored in a very hot place because they had melted a little and rubbed on the blades when the fans were turned on. I would not recommend purchasing these fans.Signed,Not Happy"
1,Walmart's is better AND cheaper,"I have a Lasko and a ""Galaxy"" (a Walmart brand).The Galaxy moves more air, is way more quiet, and costs $10.00 (regular price - not a sale)."
2,Cheap but loud,Two out of two of these Lasko box fans that I bought at Target rattle and vibrate even on the lowest speed. I was hoping for box fans like the Galaxy box fan I got at Wal-mart for my dorm - moves air and makes white noise to cover up car noise but these fans rattle so loud that I am returning them. Considering both of the fans I got from Target wobble and rattle I'd have to say it's a design or manufacturing flaw that they're so flimsy and unbalanced. Looking for a replacement.
5,Great fan!,"I love this fan. We bought it years ago and have never had a problem with it. It's pretty simple to figure out. It has three settings: High, medium, low. This is great to put in a window to circulate some fresh air. It runs pretty quietly on the low and medium settings but can get a little loud on high (which is kind of expected).Overall, this is a purchase I have not regretted. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a durable fan. You could probably find it a lot cheaper in a local store. I got mine at Dollar General."
4,They changed the picture.....,"I ordered one after seeing the image of what appeared to be the ""Premium"" version..I did however not receive a premium fan.This is my order overview showing the Picture I've been seeing since ordering it(and before I ordered it) [...] vs what they show now. To borrow a popular meme, ""Son I am Disappoint!""Honestly IF I had realized I was getting the basic model, I'd have picked a different one(same model) that was cheaper, or the actual premium for 2 dollars more or just not bothered and got or just went to Dollar General and picked one up for less without a wait time. Returns are enough hassle(wait time) to not bother and chalk it up as a loss.The actual fan I received is not bad, it's very loud(some say this is a plus) but it moves enough air to suffice.Lesson learned was; Even if Amazon is selling something themselves, never trust the picture!!!"
4,"Light, thin fan that does the trick","These fans are thin and light and made completely of plastic. They are easy to move, have multi-speeds,and have enough power to cool down a large room. We bought two and like it that they work well and are easy to store."
5,Lasko's the Best!,"I have been sleeping with a box fan in my bedroom year round for many, many years and have owned several different models but this one tops them all. I can turn up my thermostat in the summer and still stay cool and comfy, in the winter it helps circulate the warm air in the house. I have a teenage son at home and when he has friends who sleep over they can be a bit noisy sometimes. However, with my Lasko fan turned on the number 2 setting I don't hear them and my son's bedroom is right across the hall from mine. This being said, if you are looking for a quiet fan then I suggest you buy another brand. However, if you want to lower your electric bill and block out noise then this is the one to buy. You can't go wrong with this Lesko!! I reccomend it highly!"
1,SO LOUD !!!!!,"I just bought one of these from Target. This fan is LOUD and makes waaay too much noise. Even at the lowest setting, this fan sounds like an airplane is getting ready to take off. I'm not exagerating.This fan is LOUD !!! Forget about sleeping with this fan on at night. I am even worried the neighbors can hear it at night.The noise is awful -- and a bad surprise when you need to use it. My parents always had a couple of these box fans around and they never made anywhere near this kind of noise. The construction is all plastic. They dont make them like they used to.I dont get it -- the electric fan technology has been around since 1900 --why is the product getting worse and more expensive ???Save your money and buy something else."
3,A Bit Noisy,"This fan has a great price and moves air well, but it is quite noisy. I wanted a fan to use in my bedroom at night to keep me cool and was disappointed to find that this fan is noisier than any other appliance I own! If you are looking for a low priced, sturdy fan to use where noise doesn't matter, go for this fan. If you want a nice quiet fan to send a breeze through your home, keep looking! Good luck!"
5,"Wonderful fan, not so normal use","This fan is very, very loud, and moves an incredible amount of air (I'm planning on contacting the manufacturer to see just how much). It's very nice, and I'd imagine it would be very comfortable, should I use it for room cooling.I don't use it for room cooling, however. It is tied to my computer so that it blows totally into the case. It has lowered the ambient temperature in my case by over 20F and lowered the temperature of my processor by about 8F."
5,"Alot of air movement, fits nicely in the window or on a desk","My concern while purchasing this fan was air flow. Needed a substitute air conditioner for the summertime. Needed something that could create alot of air movement to suck in the cool air at night, and something that could be aimed at me could cool me off during the day, and this fan achieves that for it's lower price. Box fans are great, place then in a window and they'll cool a room down in no time. It is not a quiet fan like the ultra quiets on the market today but it is not as loud as those turbo jet fans. It has a normal good size fan noise that I don't find irritating. Other than that, you really don't need the foot attachments. I placed on the desk, turned on high and it did not fall over. So, to conclude it is a good solid fan for a reasonable price when your main concern is air flow."
5,Loud and Cool,"This fan is definitely loud. However, I don't mind it because it moves a lot of air and keeps me cool, which is especially important in the 100+ degree weather in the desert summer of Southern California.Oh, and the price wasn't bad, either."
3,Not a happy customer,"My family has had this fan for about 5 years. About a month ago it started putting out this horrible chemical smell, not a burning smell. It fills whatever room it is in in a couple hours. It was in my infant son's room, but now I'm scared of leaving it in there for his health. It is a good fan if all you want it to do is blow out a window, but I can't use it in a confined space."
2,Terrible Shipping,"I probably would've been completely happy with this item if it didn't come to me broken. It's got a thin, plastic frame and it came in a thin, cardboard box. There was no sort of packing protection at all to protect it. The frame was broken in three places and it looks terrible. It still works and the fan's good quality, but it looks absolutely awful."
1,DON'T BUY ONE !!!,"I bought one @ WalMart over a yr ago for my dogs and was waiting for summer. I used this piece of ukw for only 3 days off and on and it died for no reason. Customer support stunk, the fan isn't worth what I scoop up from my back yard.Don't waste your $$."
3,fan,"cools the room well got it for a good price and right size but, louder than i would want my next one although does not keep me awake"
5,Great fan on the cheap.,"This thing showed up 3 days early, and works as good as any 17$ fan should. I am happy, and would buy again if I needed another one."
2,Really?,"What the heck? What happened to the good old lakewood and lasko box fans? This is just a cheap wannabe that will die out in less than a year. Whats the worst part? The crappy flower petal blades are so brittle that if it falls over the blade will snap. I got mine for free from a place because of that. I replaced the blade. It is also very loud and a crappy air mover. Save your money and go buy a good old lakewood box fan from the 70's or 80's and leave this crap where it belongs, the dumpster. I gave it 2 stars because it atleast works. They don't make 'em like they used too, sadly"
2,Loud fan even at speed 1,"Pros:Moves a good amount of air, even at speed 1 setting (lowest speed).Cons:Speed 1. It's way too loud for me. I set the fan about 8 ft away from my TV, near a sliding patio door. The TV volume had to be turned up quite a bit."
2,Box Fan,You get what you pay for I guess. Our old fan broke and I decided to try shopping for one online. I chose this one because I didn't want to pay a lot and it was the least expensive. It works fine but it's very loud. I've never had a box fan this loud before. It's too loud on low to use it. But if you want a fan just to make noise while you sleep then this one will be great for you.
1,Cheap but not worth it.,"First day I had the fan, I turned it on, walked away and two minutes later it fell over and one of the blade's broke right off. I thought the fan had exploded! The air flow was ok, but it needs to be securely attached to something or it will fall over."
1,Worst buy I ever made!,I've used fans for cooling and as white noise for sleeping and bought this fan 2 weeks ago for that purpose. The fan circulated air very poorly even at high speed and that speed burned out the first night. It made no noise at all. I continued to use it but last night (night 14) it quit completely. Given more options I would rate this with MINUS 5 stars. DO NOT BUY!!
3,Weak and over-priced,"Doesn't move a lot of air and it's at least $8 more than the local big-box store. That being said, all the local big-box stores are sold out during this SoCal heatwave so i'll settle and be happy with a light (if insubstantial) breeze."
2,Went from Good To Bad,"I had high hopes for this fairly priced box fan. Although, when I turned it on the fan fell forward, plastic blade hit front grill and broke. Contacted Amazon, they directed me to maker of the fan, emailed them, no response since. Its been weeks. So now I have a box fan with a broken blade. Not a happy Amazon customer."
2,"Good fan, crappy shipping","I have no complaints with the fan itself. It does exactly what I expected, and that is to blow air and get circulation.Although, I do have complaints with the way that the fan was shipped to me. There was damage on the front panel that keeps you from touching the blades. There was also a good sized dent on one the corners from where the box had been dropped. Either they need to make the box bigger and more protective around the fan, or perhaps Amazon could put Fragile stickers on a box like this. I have done shipping with UPS, FedEx, DHL, etc... many time and ""fragile"" sticker really does make a world of a difference with how they handle product."
1,Nearly caught fire.,"I had bought mine locally and had run it for a few days. Tonight it started to stink. I found it was hot around the switch and motor. Both points smelled of smoldering plastic. It is sitting outside on the concrete drive in case it ignites later, though I don't think it will now that it is unplugged.I had a fan of the same size also by Lasko. It has seen heavy use for at least 3 years now with no problem, thus far, though after tonight I'm keeping it close by and turned off when no one is around. The new fan seemed lighter and more cheaply constructed than the older one."
2,My Lasko model 3733 worked well until it stopped.,"This fan is a good size for smaller or tight areas and moves plenty of air for an average sized space. I had it moving air in the upstairs of a Houston Texas home. It did the job well until one day it would not start up. The fan was kept clean and was not abused, it just died. The fan was purchased in 2007 at Lowes and it went out in 2009. From this quality manufacturer, by the feel and look of this Lasko Model 3733 fan I would expect more than 2 years from this product. Still looks good though."
4,"Good Fan, Reasonable Price, Shipped extremely fast","I bought this fan on Amazon after the one I used for three years finally died. The fan itself is by no means quiet however most people can sleep with it on the low setting. The fan shakes a little, even on low,and will fall over if placed directly on fluffy carpet. The best part of this fan is the amount of air moves. While other fans may be quieter this one produces a nice breeze that can be felt 15-20 feet away on low. I never use the highest setting, its powerful enough to blow t-shirts across the floor. If amazon is offering it get SUPER SAVER SHIPPING. (the free shipping option) though amazon said it would be 5-7 days mine arrived in about 36hrs. (Annapolis MD area)Overall great fan but dont buy it if your worried about a low pitched hum while youre trying to sleep."
3,lasko 3733,"this fan is not quite as loud as i would like..i like loud fans to sleep with..but other than that, its a good product!!"
3,Good but slanderous,"This is a very good book. My only problem with it involved a general demeaning of Christianity. The author forgets that Christians bless their food before eating it. Further, that they are called to be stewards of creation....though they have failed with Western Christianity's industrialization and glorification of scientism and produc tivity. Most ominous is the slandering of St. John Chrysostom, a giant in the Eastern, read ""Asian"", Orthodox Church (which, by the way, eats a vegan diet about 50% of the days of a year!) If one types ""John Chrysostom anti-semitism"" into one's browser there will appear a good number of sites dealing with the mistranslation that Patterson has so eagerly adopted in order to grind his anti-Christian blade. A little deeper research would have made for an even better book."
3,Starts like a fireball,"then goes downhill.I am not a lifelong FC fan, but worked my way back to them through Richard Thompson who has a cameo on this CD. The first 3 songs build to the amazing Honour and Praise, a song that sounds like a classic to me. The Hiring Fair does not do much for me, and the Cathy leSurf tune sounds, to my ears, just awful. Mechanical, dull arrangement with a shrill, annoying voice. Ouch!The instrumentals feel perfunctory, going through the motions rather than heartfelt performances. And the final two cuts, almost bring it back up, but not quite.Worth something. Maybe not this much. But one great song goes a loooong way!"
3,"The Texas Rangers and the Mexican Revolution: The Bloodiest Decade, 1910-1920","Written by authors trying to prove a point. Once you get by their prejudice it is a good historical read of the times, which are still relevant today"
3,False Advertising,"This product costs $1.31 per ounce, not $0.35! The product itself is perfectly acceptable. People who can't do math will probably like it."
5,Great container and product,We use this lube for my son's twice daily dilations and its easy to use and love the convenience of the container.
1,Terrible communication,Tried to contact seller several times. Was unable to. Would not do business again with him.
3,Not helping....,"I have a very bad vaginal dryness, and for some reason, it's not doing the trick. I've tried many products. I will be talking to my doctor about this. This review is not to say that this is a bad product. I guess things work differently for everyone. My issue is due to having had a hysterectomy. And I cannot use estrogen products."
4,good lube,"When I purchased, the flip top wasn't available. However, I ordered anyway to get a feel for the product quality.The quality is fine. I still will go for the flip top next time, though... more convenient."
3,Could have been better,I was disappointed by this book. The sections on gender point out the obvious and the parts on Arequipa don't seem too original. The book seems hurried to me. I've found better regional histories of Latin America.
4,Works nicely.,"This is a great starter kit for making basic labels. Works with PC only and not Macs. My OS that I'm using it with is Windows Vista Home Premium. I mainly bought it to print labels for DVD media. After installing the software and giving it a test run, the printing was a little offset. It gives you simple instructions on how to calibrate it though, and my second try was on point. Fairly simple to use as far as setting up what design and font you want to print to the label. Adequate amount of designs to choose from too. Especially for a starter kit. I am sure there is a way to print your own design to it too. I just haven't messed with it enough to know just yet. The label applicator was easy to figure out and worked good. The labels were good as well. I've applied them to CDs and tested them with success. Worth picking up."
1,Not worth the time,"Takes hours to get the thing to actually print on the labels. No matter how much I moved around calibration on my hp it always printed in the same space. Switched over to my Pixma Pro 9500 Mark II with its ridiculously expensive ink and still took for ever with trial and error to get the thing on the labels. I would say its my printer, but tried a cheap printer and moved to an $800 printer and still sucked. Go somewhere else for your label making needs."
1,Not compatable with Mac,"I bought the Memorex cd/dvd label maker kit and the jewel case inserts and a box of 50 jewel cases today.CAN NOT DOWNLOAD MEMOREX SOFTWARE ON A MAC!!Then I thought, well at least i can still use the Memorex Jewel Cases.I opened the package and 5 or 6 were already broken.I feel so ripped off.Now I have to go return them tomorrow and I lost a lot of time and money.Memorex sucks!"
2,Software not compatible with Vista,"I was more than excited to get started stomping out CD/DVD labels, as I had used this software on my old XP machine (and, while awkward to use, it worked great). However, while it seemed to install fine in Vista, nothing would print. The calibration page actually made a piece of paper feed through, but nothing printed on it. Any other attempts would show a brief flash of something sent to the print spooler, but nothing else. I tried XP compatibility mode, running as administrator... nothing. Printing from other applications works just fine, so it's not my printer or my driver. I ended up using bundled software that came with my CD burner. But hey, the labels themselves are great, and the little plastic stompy-thing is wonderful to perfectly apply the labels every time. If you're purchasing it simply for the physical product, it's more than worth your money."
3,Only okay...,"I bought this because of the great price. I have a Mac but I got around the problem by making my own template (I scanned the label and positioned it onto a blank Power Point slide. You can also use PhotoShop).I cannot comment on the software itself, but I can comment on the quality of the labels. They are so cheap! The perforations are not made throughout the label so you end up with little pieces which weren't cut. No matter how careful I was, I ended up with the little pieces. It doesn't look professional on the CD."
1,Thought this was great...BUT...,"I have not had trouble with the software or printing as others have. However, after having played a labeled cd in my cd-rom drive, I now have a sticky, glue-like substance on the readable side (on the 1/2 inch area around the center) of the latest disc I used (and the one after that I used to try to figure out what in the world was going on). There is no chance of anything having been spilled on (nor in) my drive. The only thing I can think of is that the glue from the label heated up, label shifted and adhesive oozed. And it's entirely possible every disc I use now will end up with gobs of glue on it that rubbing alcohol won't even remove. I'm confused on how this can happen since the label is on the other side of the disc, disappointed and off to find some goo-gone. I will entertain a revised review if anyone can come up with suggestions on how to fix this or attribute the glue issue to something else."
5,great for amateur/pro photographer,"very easy to use comes with blank CD stickers to print on. Good price and quality as of now still works fine without any problem encounter,"
1,What a waste of money!,"This label maker is a piece of junk. Actually, I think the problem is the label sheets. I wasted around 10 sheets and was able to successfully print only ONE lable. The rest of the 19 labels were way off, either to the right or to the top. It was frustrating and costed me a lot of ink. Finally I threw the junk out, bought Fellowes gloss finished labels and finished my labeling. Fellowes gloss finish lables are the best. Not a single one was wasted. They are expensive than Memorex labels but I will NEVER buy Memorex labels again even if they are for cents only."
3,nice labels...good price...but....,"I was happy to get this item since the label applicator I had before did not make full face labels. I was really disappointed when the piston locking mechanism on the label applicator quit after the third label. Cheap plastic. But I ""creatively"" kept it in the lock position forever! The labels are nice, not the highest quality, but good enough for home use. The software is good for making labels, but those who aren't tech savvy might find it a little difficult to figure out. I had no issues calibrating the printer. Printed right on the mark."
1,Alert! Not compatible with window's 7 32 bit!,"I am returning this Memorex label maker with great frustration!!!!! I have window's 7 32 bit. Everything should work, I could not calibrate the settings. I downloaded the calibration sheet, tweeked, tweeked and tweeked with no improvement, used a ton of ink!!!!! Some of the reviews said put settings at 0 0. I did everything. So, I don't know what to tell you readers. It is not intuitive or compatible with window's 7 32 bit. The instructions are very vague and the help just sends you back to home base. Memorex LabelMaker is not for me. I am returning it :("
5,label maker for cd's,"This is a great product! It's easy to use, and it makes the cd's, dvd's look like professional items, instead of just being scribbled on."
1,Not Very Helpful Even Though Cheap Price,"Basically I threw this in my cart because it was a good price and I thought: ""Why not""? It would have been better to stand over the toilet and throw a five dollar bill in, say ""Why Not?"" and FLUSH!"
2,1990s Software,"Someone needs to tell Memorex that there have been some improvements in software since 1994 which, apparently, was when the program that comes with the label maker was written."
2,Misled and Disappointed,"I purchased this kit because I wanted to put a label on a DVD I made. There was nothing in the accompanying online blurb which indicated that it would work only with Windows. So I, a confirmed Mac man, found that the mounting disk would open, but I could not make it work properly. The stock on which the disc blanks and spines were imprinted seemed very heavy, but the adhesive-backed portion worked OK using the round plastic mounting device in the kit. PhotoShop made me a form that matched the printed position of the labels and I filled it in with my own design. None of the designs provided on the disk of the kit met my needs, and in any event I am not sure that I could have transferred them to PhotoShop."
1,"Save yourself some time and money, dont' buy this","The included software is terrible and very difficult to use. I have a great printer and it still was able to mess every sheet up. I could not find any Word-compatible templates for these sheets, so we had to use the included software. Waste of $12."
1,"The book fails in its primary function, as a reference work.","I opened this book with some anticipation and was immediately let down. Misspelling and mistakes dog almost every page. Did you know that Crassus died in both 55 and 53BC? Gives some meaning to Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' that ""cowards die many times before their deaths."" It struck me as a book of easy compilations from, at most, secondary sources. I would prefer the more expensive, more intellectual and more satisfying Cambridge Dictionary of the Ancient World"
3,A lot of pictures of coins,"The best thing about this book are the Roman Empire maps and coins.Since I found a plain error in one of the maps where the area coding had Greece where Italy should be,I can't give this book real good marks.I have several biblical encyclopedias or dictionarieswith which to contrast this book,and although it has a lot of facts and family trees of the Caesars,it comes up short in comparison."
3,Good quality but sizes run VERY large,The shirts are nice but the sizes are extremely roomy. I bought a couple of these for my dad who is pretty stocky and always wears and x-large but these were very big on him.
5,Solid and dependable...,"I've owned this for about a year after having literally tossed out the Black & Decker Gizmo Grater I had purchased and owned for barely 2 weeks. It's a simple ""microplane"" style grater, pretty much, which shreds cheese more than it grates (Not too fine) quickly and easily. The grip is perfect for no slip grating. It works well on hard cheese, carrots, and plenty of other things. I've even used it to grate cheddar (refrigerate it first!) and it worked great. To clean it, I just knock it one time against the sink to get the excess out (It never sticks) and put it in the dishwasher. The knocking hasn't hurt it a bit. Unlike the Gizmo, this does exactly what it's supposed to! Epecially at the new Clearance price of less than $9, I certainly recommend it."
5,Perfect pop,"Perfect pop by a criminally under-appreciated artist. MJ crafts these melodic, heart-felt, toe-tapping, perfect pop songs that deserve to be heard by a wider audience. Gorgeous ""ear candy""."
1,Silly season,"I didn't have particularly high hopes for High School musical, but my wife wanted to watch it. Needless to say, it disappointed even my expectations. It's just about as corny and cheesy as you'd expect. The protagonists are perfect, good looking, intelligent, kind, etc, etc. Worst of all, the music wasn't even that good. The songs weren't catchy and sometimes were sung amateurishly. I guess I'm probably not the intended audience, but still I can't imagine anybody over 12 enjoying this."
5,6 yr old loves it!,"My 6 year old loves all of the movies, and was so excited to have all the songs she could sing-a-long to!"
5,Must have for HSM fans,"My five year old recently got hooked on the HSM chain, and she had to have the movies AND cd's, so that not only can we watch every second while we're home, but listen to the music every second in the car. Sounds awful, right? Well, amazingly, it's NOT awful, they're great, and I got hooked too. The movies and music are addictive, and we love 'em. If you've seen HSM, you need this cd!"
5,OH MY GOSH!!!,"oh my gosh... i'm just like in love with the disc and the movie... if u have not watch,is too bad for u... because i must say that it is the best movie i have ever watch... and the disc,must buy... i am sure u won't get bored of it... haha =)"
1,Unsure Yet,I bought this cd for my daughter. I am waiting til Christmas to give it to her so I am unsure how to rate it yet!
1,High School Musical,Don't Buy it. Be warned. It's stupid. You will regret it is the worst possible thing that has come to musicals and hopefully will be the last.
4,as described,CD quality as described and promised however it took FOREVER for it to get shipped to me.
3,You'll be hearing this over and over again.,"The tunes are catchy and my daughters, 7 and 4, love to listen, sing and dance. It makes the car ride faster ... but it drives their Dad crazy. The songs really stick in your head. I don't mind dancing around to the music with them. It's fun."
4,Not my choice if you're looking for a karaoke cd,"This version of hsm is a two disc set. The first is a ""regular"" cd of the hsm soundtrack. The second is a ""bonus"" karaoke disc. I give the regular disc gets 5 stars but the karaoke disc gets about 2 stars. Why? Well, it only has instrumentals. Most CD+G discs out there (certainly ones meant for kids) have, say, the first 8 tracks instrumental and the next 8 tracks with vocals. My kids (and most others I know) prefer to sing along with the artist. So if you're just looking for a HSM cd, buy this one. If what you really want is a good karaoke cd, buy the Disney karaoke series cd (red and yellow cover, must say cd+g)."
3,thought it was a TRUE karaoke version,"Having already owned the original movie soundtrack, I purchased the ""karaoke"" version to use with my middle school choir for ""We're All in This Together"". My idea of a karaoke song is background music only (instruments, not vocals.) It wasn't until I listened to the cd that I discovered that the song included ALL background chorus vocals. The only thing left out were the solos by the main characters. Quality was fine, content was disappointing."
3,Fine,"The Cd was in fine shape, and I enjoyed it. Everything was handled properly, and I found no issues with the product. The High School Musical 2 Non stop Dance Party is better, but I can't expect the first one to be as good as the second one."
4,Amazon Goofed,"This cd is amazing, but Amazon has wrongly attributed some of the performances to Zac Efron. He sings for Troy in High School Musical 2, but he does NOT sing for Troy in High School Musical (the first movie) or anywhere on that soundtrack. Both Troy voices are great but Amazon should get the listing right."
5,Great,"I am so happy I found this product. Eating kosher isn't always easy, and its even harder with kids that want to eat treat they see their friends eating. Have no fear kosher rice krispys are here."
3,What was the real scandal?,Capitol Scandal was very hard to put down. I read it while I was traveling and before I knew it we were at the destination. Sharon Hayes is a complex woman with secrets and problems of her own. She faces demons of the past and chosing between family and clients. The book has details that make you wonder if some of these incidents could really happen....and some of the incidents could have been taken directly from the headlines.
2,texans do d.c.,"not particularly legal,nor thrilling. tone is decidedly lowbrow. main character is portrayed as a feisty,confident, modern woman; but she comes off as crude,contrived, immature and brazenly disbarable. vulgar titillation even by d.c. gossip standards. well below average."
5,Loved it!,"This is my first Melanie George book and I though it was great! I read it in one night. It had a little bit of everything that I love. Romance, hot sex, intrigue, and suspense.I have been having a hard time finding suspense romances that don't have too much suspense or romance and it's been very hard. I found this book completley by luck and I am very glad I did!!If anyone has any other suggestions for Romantic/Suspense books, please let me know!"
2,Are there two Melanie George's?,"It's hard to believe that the same writer wrote this book and all the great Devil books. Devil May Care, Handsome Devil, The Devil's Due...all great reads. Like No Other and The Art of Seduction. Great reads. Her two contemporary books (this one and The Mating Game which I could even finish) lack the writing style, the witty dialogue, the great characters. In To Die For, the heroine is a dull, lifeless, boring person and you have to wonder what does this amazing man see in her? This is not true in her good books. I'd say stay away from her contemporary books and read all the others. Like night and day."
4,Pretty good book,"This was a decent book, not the best i have read but not the worst. There was just enough suspence and romance to keep you turning the pages. Loved the tearjerking ending. Not bad!i also recommend Heartbreaker by Julie Garwood, After the Night by Linda Howard"
3,a victim of hype,"altars of madness is a historically important album, but it's not a great album. while there was nothing else quite this blazingly fast and twisted at the time--you could swear some of the riffs are being played backwards--the lack of rhythmic dynamics makes it monotonous to sit through; it gets to a point where we are merely waiting for the next hellish, atonal solo to ooze out of the speakers. it is also worth noting that the band was still very conceptually immature at this point. ""evil spells""? really? ooo, now i'm spooked.don't get me wrong, it's good, but blessed are the sick and covenant show this band at their most masterful. altars has its place as a historical document, but other relics from around the same time like repulsion's horrified and autopsy's severed survival have aged better, and are still awesome without any qualifications or contextual pretense."
2,WAY overrated,"Seen a lot of people hailing this one as classic - well don't believe the hype my friends. The production is shoddy and the songs, as with most Morbid Angel albums, aren't bad but they aren't that great either.This is a mediocre death metal band, they have yet to put forth a truly good record. To avoid disappointment, seriously consider borrowing a friend's copy or something before you buy. I cannot recommend buying this record."
3,"A spirited, raw affair","Morbid Angel's first proper album is a spirited, raw affair, lacking the majestic abstraction of later releases. The guitars are often chorused, which greatly dates the sound. While there are plenty of riffs and tempo changes, overall the compositions and lyrics are simplistic. Still, this early effort reveals the players' formidable skills. Consider this their ""Kill `Em All.""The remaster, in keeping with current trends, includes several bonus remixes at the end. The remixes are technically interesting in that they offer alternate solutions to sonic questions, such as whether to add effects to a guitar solo, or whether to emphasize guitars or vocals. However, the remixes generally sound washed-out, and only confuse the listening experience."
4,Not as good as Blessed or Covenant,"This album sounds as good to me today as it did when I first heard it about 15 years ago. Listening to it, I am reminded how far Death Metal has come. When this album was first released, the ""growl"" and ""blast beat"" were new inventions but have now come to characterize the genre as a whole. This is a must have album for anyone who likes Metal."
1,Low quality. Rusts. Limits Braking Power.,"This is made of thin, brittle plastic.The photo shows brass contacts, but the contacts are steel with a thin zinc coating. It rusts easily, unlike the higher quality connectors which use brass. Steel also has a conductivity about half that of brass, which would limit brake current, a possible safety issue.There is a three-year warranty, but the shipping is on me, and all I would get would be another one with the same deficiencies.have junked it and bought one with brass contacts. No corrosion problems, now."
2,You get what you pay for!,"Housing cracked as soon as the set screw was tightened down, cheap plastic used in production. Wire hold down tabs very thin metal. I would spend a little extra money and get a quality one if I had to do it over."
3,Not for the novice,"I bought this to familiarize myself with Calculus in preparation for my Masters Degree. It did help but as a math novice I didn't get as much out of it as I could have if I had more training.If you have had pre-calculus and are looking to review, this would be a good choice."
4,Precalculus (cliffsQuickReview),i ordered this for my daughter to help with her homework because her teacher was not helping her with her explanations
5,"Platinum album, platinum sound.","Love So Right is the most sweet voiced, tuned, sung, and produced BeeGees song. But it also has other beautiful hits like Children of The World, You Stepped Into My Life, and the disco You Should Be Dancing. Can't Keep A Good Man Down is also awesome, but no song on this album is boring. Do not DARE miss it!"
4,Excellent New Start for the Bee Gees,"After Main Course, the Bee Gees started to write more songs that were into rock and roll, and disco. Songs that are featured in this album are You Should Be Dancing (#1), Love So Right (#6), Love Me (#7), Boogie Child (#13), and Children of the World (#24). In comparison to Main Course, this album is better, but if you compare it to the Spirits Having Flown, its a little too weak. The reason I suggest that is because the Bee Gees had gained more confidence in writing after the Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack, but they are stronger than Main course, since Main Course was a switch for them.Great album. Nice painting at the front!"
4,Holds The Test of Time,"... This record was one of my first purchases as a teenager and in spite of some of my changing tastes in music, I still always appreciated the harmonies of the Gibb Brothers and the spunky instrumental support.Many good quality songs on here as it is indeed hard to choose a favorite. I guess that I would lean towards Boogie Child with its spunky guitars and captivating melodies. However I really appreciate the shear beauty of ballads like Love Me and The Way It Was. Those numbers are sung with so much emotion. Also Can't Keep A Good Man Down has some real spunky guitar fills.Truthfully I prefer this recording to the somewaht overhyped Saturday Night Fever Soundtrack. Its a bit more mainstream. Anyway, this is very suitable for many audiences."
2,Subway Is Great- The Rest Isn't,"If it is possible to recommend a CD on the power of one song and one song alone, then that is exactly what I'm doing. ""Subway"" rocks- it's a great song, sung in a falsetto style I've never really heard Barry use before. Sensible use of synthesizers and a steady, flowing feel to the song make it one of their best. It's a hidden treasure. The rest of the album is overblown and pompous.But you can't get ""Subway"" anywhere else, so... the decision is yours. The best song of their career just happens to be on what I consider to be their weakest album. Go figure."
4,A Covenant of Compassion,"Just GenerosityRon SiderRon Sider is a writer committed to several agendas. He is a strong advocate for the word of God, an unconditional submission to Jesus Christ, and a deep desire to see poverty in America eliminated. Sider begins chapter four with a question that seems to drive his passion for the subject this book addresses. ""If a person works fulltime all year, can that person earn enough so that his or her family can escape poverty? For millions of Americans today, the answer is no.""The closing chapter offers the hope for America's poor. Sider says we can end the scandal. He offers what he call a Generous Christian Pledge. He proposes that all believers adhere to the pledge. He says, Generous Christians and other people of good will can transform our country. We can end the scandal of widespread poverty in the richest nation in history."
2,Yawn,"Most of the stories in this book are very boring. Even what'smeant to be interesting such as the story about a lesbian vampirebrothel-owner (i kid you not!)is so overdone that it's positively farcical. I don't have the book to hand at the moment but I remember another story that tried a stream-of-consciousness approach that failed miserably. I felt like I was wading through the stories. Of course there are some good stories from a book boasting contributions from Baldwin and Morrison, but the vast majority are nothing special. Credit must go to the editors who arranged the stories in pertinent sections. Pity they didn't have better material to work with."
5,Best ever,This is the best product going round I bought three just in case they go out of style I had looked every where for these
4,Comfortable,"I bought it with the iron grill... It works great. The handle is nice and comfortable. The only thing is that i do wash it right a way, no dishwasher. if not, i think, it would stain. But I am happy with the buy."
5,Love it,It's everything I was hoping for. Perfect size and stiffness and works great with my cast iron skillet. Seems to be well made so it should last for a long time.
3,Ok ...but heavy and bulky!,"Haven't used it yet...it's nicely made but afraid that i may have purchased the wrong product. However, very nice if you are looking for lasagne turner."
1,Item Pictured is not what is Shipped,"I ordered 3 of these to replace 2 that I've had for nearly 15yrs. What I received were particularly cheaply made - poor effort knockoffs of the original 'CornerSpray' that is pictured.The product shipped is not labeled in any way, nor does it appear to be capable of spraying in a square pattern for right angle corners either. Particularly lightweight unlike the originals, cheaply painted & not powder coated, plus the typical last only 1-2yrs quality plastic couplers.No Star rating.Ace Hardware can do much better than this.Returning tomorrow.5/19/11 Update. Fast response to my request to return, but it cost $12 shipping to return, plus the original $9 shipping when ordered.This all could have been avoided with some truth in advertising that consists on accurate picture of the actual product carried plus a more accurate description of this predictable 'Made in China' product."
1,total junk,"Total garbage. How dare the author present this as a document regarding process redesign in Travel Management. This is a totally vacuous, useless piece of work that was most likely developed for a customer who paid way too much for what was delivered. Not worth 15 bucks. Not really even worth the time spent canceling the order, which I just had to do on a matter of principle. Needless to say the document has been deleted and shredded from my computer.I gave it a single star only because a rating is required"
5,This is one to read now!,"Judith Wright's book, There Must Be More Than This: Finding More Life, Love, and Meaning by Overcoming Your Soft Addictions is the most refreshing personal growth book I have read in a long while. Judith's approach to creating more in your life is inspiring and uplifting, while also providing pragmatic, practical tools for the reader. After reading the book, I am better equipped to identify my own soft addictions and to see how they keep me from living the life I say I want. I have already made some small, but significant, changes that have impacted the quality of my life in balancing work, family and self. I feel more hopeful and optimistic that I can create the life I truly desire and one that reflects who I truly am and all my unique qualities. I am authoring my life, instead of simply letting it drift by. Read this book if you hunger for more in your life and use Judith's insightful approach to help you get more now."
2,Book is based on Christian values,"There are some interesting ideas presented here. However it isn't a book for everyone: it is written from a devout Christian point of view.If the authors were more clear about that on the cover and in the description, then that would be fine. But there weren't any clues until I started reading the text.Here's an example from page 139: ""We are meant to be addicted to God, but we develop secondary addictions that temporarily appear to fix our problem.""Search for ""God"" and you get 26 hits. Again, I just think the cover should have been more transparent about that because it is a core frame for the book. This isn't ""a book written by someone who happens to be Christian,"" it's more like a Christian book.As an alternative, I'd suggest an awareness practice; there are several out there. They tend to be based on the same core material, and can work hand-in-hand with any set of spiritual beliefs."
5,A sweet read,"Picking up this book and reading any page has been helpful for me to connect with myself and to other people. I have noticed my mood becoming lighter from reading it. I love the message, especially since I work inthe substance abuse field - everything we do to cover up our feelings that prevents us from being with ourselves can be seen as an addiction. And it is the human condition - not just hard drugs or alcohol are addictions. I think the sooner that we see this, the sooner we can feel less ashamed and be able to ""come clean"" about the crazy stuff we do.This book has really helped me in my personal life and as an addictions counselor in terms of having more love and compassion and purpose in my life."
1,There Must Be More ...,"Look at the cover photo. Have I said enough? This book is mindless drivel. I feel sorry for anyone who has actually read this insincere, unimportant, uninformed ""book"". We're not laughing with you, we're laughing at you."
4,Malcolm x makes good viewing,"For what Spike Lee is doing in this film i think he captured alot of it reasonably well, but it's got to be hard to make a film on one of the defining people in history. Malcolm x is a long film which is a good film but if you watch this excpecting it to be around 2 hours you should be warned in advance (it clocks in at around about 3. The film portrays many important issues that we live with today mainly that you should not judge a person by his past and that people really can change even against all odds. Though Malcolm x is not the most lucid of films it still makes good viewing and Denzel Washington himself makes a very admiral and well acted performace. This is one of the better historical films around."
3,Read The Book!!!,"I love Malcolm, I love Spike, I love Denzel...I grew up on the street Malcolm was born on, in North Omaha, Pinkney Street, BUT...the movie is lacking...Read The Book!!! It is a revelation."
5,"All I can say is, it was a very well made film.","Malcolm X was a great man who influenced millions through his teachings and words. This film does him justice, beautifully acted with a witty and intelligent screenplay - this is a must see for anyone. The ending is most tender with Nelson Mandela telling the next generation about Mr.X and how he taught our society to be more humane towards others. When the credits started to roll I felt all warm and teary eyed, evidence for a perfect film."
5,One of the best if not the best video I've ever seen.,"Denzel Washington's portrayal was beyond excellent; he captured the spirit and the essence of Malcolm X. His portrayal, timing and execution was on the money. My only question is; why isn't this video available in DVD? Almost everyone ranks it with 5 stars. Please get this video in DVD format and in multiple languages. It's a must see."
5,Malcolm X was a great movie,I would definitely recommend this movie to others. It was historically accurate and such a great story. This is a must watch movie.
4,"good, but necessarily flawed","It is by nature unmercifully condensed. Several events and characters are combined into one instance. It is quite moving, however, gaining traction as the film wears on. Good reenactment of the actual Audubon Ballroom assassination, based upon multiple sources."
2,"Powerful, but at the same time inacurate","I first saw this movie on one of those cable movie channels and decided to pick up the book it was based on (The Autobiography of Malcolm X as Told to Alex Haley). After I got done reading the book, I decided to watch the movie again, seeing as I had come into the middle of the movie on the TV. What I saw and what I read were, at times, 2 completely different things. I recommend reading the book, so you get a real portrait of who Malcolm X was."
3,Not accurate,It does not follow what the book says. I was disappointed. Leaves the viewer with the wrong idea of what his life really was like.
4,A Powerful American Tale,"And I firmly believe Malcolm X was a true American. He was passionately, almost obsessively, commited to his ideas. He valued justice. He understood discipline. Yet, he showed undeniable strength and compassion when he realized that some of his beliefs no longer served his spiritual needs. To me, that is the ultimate struggle for ANYONE who tries to call America home.Spike Lee's treatment of Malcolm X never degenerates into hagiography, race baiting, or worse, Hollywood stereotype. Instead he -- and of course, Denzel Washington's tour de force performance -- presents Malcolm the myth, the martyr and the man. What better dichotomy is there for someone forever enshrined in the pantheon of American fame? I hope we never forget his legacy...This movie left me energized, angry, confused and hopeful all at the same time. Soon after, I mustered up the courage to read Malcolm's autobiography and was equally moved by it. Thank you, Spike for the inspiration."
5,Why No Oscar?,"To this day, ""Malcolm X"" is one of my all time favorite films. It is a shame that some of the greatest performances are ignored while equal or lesser performances are praised. For example, Denzel Washington won for ""Glory"" (a great film) but lost with ""Malcolm X"" and Laurence Fishburne lost with ""Othello"" and won for ""Whats Love Got to do With It"" (an inferior film). And all this while there are screams of discrimination in Hollywood. Denzel wins for a powerful slave role, but not for a controversial figure. Laurence wins for an abusive husband, but not for an awsome portrayal of a Shakespeare character in an inter-ethnic relationship.Not only is ""Malcolm X"" one of Washington's greatest performances, it is Spike Lee's greatest achievement so far and I own all of his films. It is a daring, insightful, and moving experience. Brother Malcolm's entire experience can be an inspiration to us all, regardless of our background. I feel it is an important film for all to see."
3,"Great acting, but not totally Malcolm","I enjoyed this movie a great deal, and I think Denzel Washington performed excellently.However, I am afraid that many young people will take this movie as an accurate portrayal of Malcolm X, his life, and what he believed in. It is not.I am afraid that many will come away from this movie with the idea that Malcolm was a militant pro-black racist of sorts. Although he may have began his journey through life with many of those ideas, his quest and life experiences ""tuned"" his views dramatically. The end result was a much wiser and humble yet strong individual, who believed in good people of all ""races"". I believe he was very good at heart, and his life was a journey that taught him many things. Those who want a better picture of this man should see the 1972 documentary ""Malcolm X: His Own Story as it Really Happened"". THAT is the best movie I have seen of him to date!"
5,Great Experience!,"I had been looking for this dvd for a while. When I saw it, I immediately jumped on it. It arrived within the time that was stated and I am very pleased. Thanks!!"
5,Xceptional,"Why did Denzel miss out on an acadamy award for this film is one great mystery to me. His mannerisms, speech and passion is pure Malcolm. And his likeness to Malcolm is uncanny.A gripping film which is inspirational and confronts all Americans to the reality of racism during those turbulent times. A special visit by none other than Nelson Mandella at the end was surprising and very fitting.This is a classic drama which you will surely love as much as I did."
5,Highlights of Malcom X the movie,"This movie shows a lot of details about the late Malcom X before and after Islam. Malcom was a drinker smoker & drug user, a smooth criminal, until he was locked up for 8 years for robbery. He met this brother from the radical Nation of Islam which he accepted. After Malcom was released and started talking to people about Eligahi Muhammud and the nation of Islam, his so called brothers started to hate on him. Malcom knew that Islam did not teach hatred, that it's not about skin tone but it's about piety to the One true God. This is a good movie it's deep! I say more power to brother Malcom for opening his heart to Islam. Any group that teach hatered is not a religion it's a seperatist radical man made club, not a house of God. Malcom knew that skin tone does not define a persons character."
5,This movie was undeniably excellent.,"This is probably one of the best coming of age black movies ever. (Or should I say Black History movies ever).This movie has a stunning appearance by Denzel Washington. The first half of the movie is about how he was a pimp and gangster, and how when he went to jail, he found his senses. I remmeber when I was at the theater in 1992, I clapped at the end for like five minutes.Let me tell yall this. Any kid doing a project on Malcolm X, BUY THIS MOVIE. I repeat, BUY THIS MOVIE. Don't get that 1972 biography documentary. Buy this 1992 spike lee joint. I think it is the second best movie Spike Lee made. Denzel's appearance is comparable to Jamie Foxx's in RAY (2004) and Will Smith's in ALI (2001). (Note: THey need to make movies on MArtin Luther King Jr, Nelson Mendela, and Ghandi, all being wonderful black leaders.)"
3,Good,"The movie was decent. Outstanding performances by Denzel and Angela make the film, however, I found the book to be more informative."
4,Nice Portrayal of a controversial man,"It was very difficult for me to go through with this film. However, the topic of race is probrably very uncomfortable to many Americans, whatever their skin color. If we are to move in the future we must discuss and learn about the controversies of the past. This includes Malcolm X, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and George Wallace. It was a little degrading at the end when Lee was praising racist Afrocentric education, the Kennedy assasination, and Black Power. Despite Malcolm's eccentric behavior, his point was clear that African Americans should be treated better by America. He was proud of his race, loved the African American people and his family, and his rejection of the Nation of Islam to embrace Whites as brothers were very positive in improving race relations. Very good and honest view of Malcolm X."
5,Magnificent,"This non-fictional movie is outstanding!! It's like 3 hours long, but when you watch it, you wish it was longer. Some people may get offended, but educated ones will understand(mainly, because they'll watch the whole movie). Malcolm X's autobiography may give you more details, but it's best to watch the movie first to get a better understanding and imagination. Also, Denzel Washington plays an excellent role. So to sum this up, ""X"" is truly an excellent choice."
5,Absolutely Incredible,"I was totally surprised by this film. I had never been a spike lee fan, though I always appreciated his talent, but this film definitely changed my mind. I don't really know where to start, because in my mind, the film is nearly flawless: from Denzel Washington's amazing performance to an ambitious script to Spike Lee's incredible direction (of course putting Oliver Stone to shame in the realm of political biographies). My only complaint involves the ending of the film: a clever but preachy montage of images and voice-over narration that really softens what could have been a tremendous impact at the end. Of course, these are petty complaints. Buy the movie!"
1,One DVD came in the package...,"I am very disappointed...I order this DVD, only 1 DVD came in the package, this is a 2 disc DVD and the movie is Stretched."
5,Honor Brother Malcolm,"Ilove the movie played bye the two stars, brother Denzel and sister Bassett. The movie showed the true honor and life of Brother Malcolm and how his life was and how he influence his people bye speaking the truth and what needed to be said. His words are as powerful today as they were back then. His words are what's happening right now, he was ahead of his time.Brother Malcolm was our hero and our leader,now and forever Tammantha Shaw."
2,Quality was below par,"I liked the movie a lot, but the streaming was choppy, and we didn't receive HD quality for the majority of the movie. Twice we had to stop the movie and go back to the Amazon interface to start to movie over again to get it to play through."
3,It went nowhere fast,"Spike Lee spent too much time dealing with Malcolm's ""hustling"" days and not enough time on his days in the Nation. Lee only highlighted a few key speeches and did not fully explain Malcolm's break from the Nation of Islam. Those who do not know that much about X might be confused as for the reason. His trip to Mecca was depicted well, but the storyline after that is not very strong. For a three hour movie, it did not have a lot of information. Denzel's performance was the only thing that saved this movie."
4,Oscar-worthy performance by Denzel Washington,"I admit that I never thought much of Denzel Washington until I saw him in ""Training Day"". In that movie, I was very impressed with his ability to play a very confident, smart, and super-cool character. He deserved that Oscar. Now, watching ""Malcom X"", a movie made by Spike Lee in 1992, I realize that he has always been that kind of actor. His portrayal of Malcolm is full of power and subtlety. I've never had that much interest in Spike Lee's films, but I have to say that this one is very well done, and very interesting, no matter where you fall on the political spectrum."
5,This is a book not to be missed.,"This is a wonderful book that touched my heart. It is not only tells of the love of two people, but also of the love God has for us."
4,The latest LEN album,"Diary Of The Madmen contain a lot of very good LEN songs and a few interesting colorful songs (Kookoo Docks). The best gems on the album include the cover versons of Video Killed The Radio Star and Cool It Now. Along with containing some of the best angry LEN songs ever (Fight, The Royal Screw Job). Unfortunately, the album does not include Bobby, We Rock The Mike, King Of The Block, and Saturday which were some of the best songs on their album advance We Be Who We Be. Dispite that, this album is a very good buy."
3,Not as good as other OXO items,"I got a whole set of OXO kitchen utensils. I was a bit disappointed to find these are stamped steel with rough edges. Not rough so much that they would cut you, but rough as in not a nice smooth high quality feel. I'm also not crazy about the handles as they force you to hold the tool in an exact position - I'm used to grabbing the tool maybe closer to the scoop for better balance.But they are okay, and a huge improvement over the plastic crap we had."
4,great,"It's very sturdy and great overall. It has a good handle weight, but the spoon is very big. Just be aware."
4,what you'd expect,this is a pretty awesome cover album!labrie's voice gets a bit off at times but the musicianship is spot-on!it is what it is!
5,very solid cover live set!,not being a dream theater at all but this complete covering of metallica's master of puppets cd is very well done and very creatively crafted considering DT's band format no 2nd guitaristbut a keyboard player.
4,"Another ""Tough Tenor"" Favorite","Tenor saxophonists Johnny Griffin and Eddie ""Lockjaw"" Davis made nearly a dozen recordings together for what is now the Fantasy/OJC family of labels, and all of them are excellent. (Though I was a bit of tough onLookin' at Monk-- see my review.) ""Tough Tenor Favorites"" is their fifth album for Jazzland and they pick up where the others left off. This February 5, 1962 session features the solid rhythm trio of Horace Parlan on piano, Buddy Catlett on bass and Ben Riley on drums. Their chemistry and now classic formula is well demonstrated on terrific renditions of ""Bahia"" and ""Tin Tin Deo,"" which I have enjoyed comparing to accounts by 'Trane (""Afro-Blue"" and ""TTD"" are nearly identical) -- a three way tenor battle if you will. With this now OOP CD beginning to creep up in price in the collector's market, make ""Tough Tenor"" your favorite while you can."
4,"slow going, but worth plowing through","This book tells the story of three generations of men in the Pontifex family. Theobold is unable to resist the domination of his father and acquiesces to following the ministry, as his father desires. Theobold's son Ernest, the novel's main character, is not exceptionally bright, motivated or gifted. Yet he succeeds in throwing off the religious and moral mantle he inherited. By doing so, he rejects the values of the age.This book is most interesting read in it's historical context. The discursions and lengthy sentences make it a slow read. But if you are in the mood for a classic, this one is enjoyable."
2,The Way of All Flesh,"The Way of All Flesh I am sure it is a great book.... but I personally did not think it a good ""read""I REGRET BUYING IT..."
3,The Way of All Flesh,"A very important novel of the 19th Century. How it is included in the best novels of the 20th Century by the New York Times is beyond me. The book was begun more than 30 years before 1900. Although completed in 1872, it lay unpublished for nearly 30 years; presumably until such time as some of its anti-Victorian ideals would be more palatable to the British public.The story principally centers around the life of Ernest Pontifex, an impreesionable and naive young man who is reared by devout Anglican parents. Their well meaning cruelty shelter Ernest and cause him to make bad decisions and derail his ambitions. As a result of the consequences of these bad decisions, Ernest learns to manage his own life and becomes a success despite his early failures.Although important in its time, the novel is brutally slow."
3,Must have for Matsumoto fans only!,"Don't get me wrong, I love the work of Matsumoto-sama, I have ever since I caught the original Captain Harlock television series while living in France in 1980 and 1981. I also own every bit of his work on video and DVD where available, from the Galaxy Express 999 films to all five of the Battleship Yamato films. I love this OVA, but I admit that it is one that only a Matsumoto-sama fanatic could. If you are not smitten by the Harlock Universe stay away from this DVD, because it will make no sense to you and you will not be able to overlook the technical glitches and poor computer animation."
3,"Great Anime, Bad Execution","This DVD would've gotten 5 stars if not for the following flaws, the english voice acting is AWFUL (a trademark of ADV). Secondly the audio language gets screwed up in the 2nd episode (it goes from Japanese to French). If you're a fan of the Harlock series, BUY IT! But please to really get the most out of it, play it in Japanese with english subtitles. I couldn't watch for 5 minutes in english audio without feeling sick..."
5,Celtic Women - Strong Women,"Peter Berresford Ellis reveals the important role Celtic women played in their society in his book, ""Celtic Women: Women in Celtic Society & Literature."" Using historical documents, Ellis offers evidence that women in Celtic society had rights that were protected by law to own property, to choose who and when they wanted to marry, to divorce if they wanted and to take with them the property they owned prior to marriage, as well as half of the property held with their husband (after a certain period of time). The women of the Ancient Celts fought in battles, and trained young warriors. They could be rulers, priests, doctors and lawyers. Ellis reveals how all of these rights granted to Celtic women gradually changed after the introduction of Christianity by the Roman priests. Well written and documented, Ellis makes the history of the Ancient Celts, particularly women, very interesting reading."
2,Mixing fact and fiction,"Ellis makes interesting points, but seems very uncritical in his use of mythology in a way that's been debunked in Celtic studies for decades. If you want a much more compelling analysis of the real roles of Celtic women at least in early Irish society, I'd suggest *Isle of Women* by Lisa Bitel."
5,This book is an excellent research resource.,"After researching for years and looking desperately for a good resource on Women in the Celtic times, this book was an amazing find. I was thrilled by the information I found here. I learned things about Celtic Women that I had never imagined could be true. I know that I will be using this book for many years to come."
5,A good buy,"We finally replaced ours after 10 or so years. This is wonderful, sharp, easy to handle, and a good buy."
5,Works great and easy on the hands,What can I say. It's so nice to own items that work smoothly and well.
5,best can opener i've ever had,"finally, a can opener that doesn't wimp out in the middle of opening a can. actually sharp and does its job, no sticking, no superhuman effort necessary to operate it. A+"
5,Worth the extra cash,"I always brought the cheap 5 to 7 dollar opener. They would break after awhile and after my last one broke I decided to purchase a high quality one. In general I don't have a problem spending a few more bucks if I'm getting a good, solid, high quality tool. I took a deep breath and spent more than double the highest price I have ever paid for an opener. I can say I'm very happy I purchased this one as it has not failed me at all, not even in the slightest way. Clicks onto the can nicely, hds it perfect and I never struggle with turning the gear. I highly recommend this opener. It has become a very useful and dependable kitchen tool. Thank you to all the other reviewers as that's why i took such a leap of faith. I purchased this in december of 2012"
4,"Good for Hands with Arthritis, But Not Good Enough","I bought this because my wife has arthritis in her hands and I hoped it would make it easier for her to open cans. It helps, but not as much as I would like."
1,Oxo is junk,"I open maybe 4 cans per week. I bought this because it looked sturdy. I was sorely mistaken. Oxo is cheap junk from China. Do not fall for the good looks. This thing broke, completely, and I had to use an old knife to get a can of green beans open. I will never buy any Oxo product again. yes, I am pissed."
1,"This is a great can opener, for about a year.","This worked quite well for about a year. It then became increasingly tricky to use and is now junk. The opener will pierce the can, and nothing more.How can making a can opener be this difficult?"
4,What were they thinking?,"This can opener use to have nice ""all rubber"" handles, which felt comfortable and gave a good grip if your hands were wet. The all rubber handles even came in handy to help open small bottle caps.After a few years of use the cutter got dull and the frame was rusted. So, I bought a new one. Unfortunately, the new ""metal & rubber"" handles are definitely NOT comfortable to use. But since I only open one or two cans a week, I kept it. Hey, it's a can opener and it works."
5,Fantastic can opener!,"This can opener is a joy to use. So easy on the hands and works like a dream even for a southpaw like me! I threw my old one right in the garbage. I see lots of canned food in our future. This is the first OXO product I have purchased, but I sure will look for this brand again."
1,"Rust, Rust, and More Rust","7 months and this baby is ready for the trash. I could accept that from the $1.99 camping can opener. But I'm not gonna pay $12.00 for this thing to rust out in half a year.Problem being the rust builds up on the shaft of the turning gear and slowly works its way through to the divet. We have never put this thing into the washing machine. Very disappointing.As an emergency replacement we got the no name can opener from the grocery store. Cheap, clean, works well."
2,It WON'T Last,"When I first got this can opener, I was very pleased with it. Two years later, it is the same as all the cheap China made crap. The gears are not heat treated and wear so that after a couple of years, it binds up and doesn't work.Please, won't someone make a quality can opener that lasts."
3,"Easy to use, but leaves the top connected","I just got one of these to replace two Swing-A-Ways that kept leaving the tops connected to the cans. This does the same thing. In puncturing the can to get started, the can opener depresses the top so low that it cannot cut through it when the circumference is complete. Even backing and forwarding won't cut through. That leaves me twisting the top until the metal fatigues and it comes off with a jagged piece sticking out.So, real easy to use, but it doesn't get the job done."
5,Best Manual Unit We've found,"It's amazed us that it's been so difficult to find an item as simple as a can opener that worked. We purchased several in the last few months at grocery and kitchen stores only to find that they simply would not work. All of the ones we purchased had difficulty staying on track after the initial penetration of the can lid causing us to keep having to start over several times on each can. After reading Amazon reviews, we decided to try this model and have very happy with the unit, it has opened cans with minimal effort and no ""do overs"". We have since purchased a few more of these for our parents and other family members, all say that they are very happy with the product."
5,"Don't hesitate, buy it","I read the product reviews on Amazon.com before buying this can opener and they were very positive, so I went ahead and purchased it. I have to agree with the other reviewers -- it's definitely great. It's sturdy and comfortable to use. It turns easily. It cuts the can smoothly and doesn't skip or stop or ride up and over the edge of the can. It's true that a can opener isn't an earth-shattering buying decision, but if you don't want to be wasting your money buying multiple cheap can openers from Wal-Mart that break the first time you use them, then this product is a wise choice."
3,"Easy to use, but doesn't complete the job","While this can opener is commendable for how smoothly and easily it works, it does not cut through the last millimeter or two of the can top. This means you have to twist the top off, which leaves a tiny but very sharp protrusion. Given the usual high quality of OXO products, when I first bought this, I was sure I'd picked up a dud. OXO replaced it quickly and with no fuss, but the second opener has exactly the same flaw. Now I see I'm not the only one to complain about this."
3,"Great can opener, easy to use but it's Made in China",The can opener is easy to use. But it would be nice if they can manufacture it here. (I'm trying to find another can opener that is manufactured here)
5,excellence,"My wife said she wanted it, I asked ""why would you want a manual can opener that's $20 + shipping"" She said she'd used one and it was ""wonderful"". I don't know about her choice of adjectives but I can say that it is, by far, the best manual can opener I have ever used. Actually easier to than our old electric. Don't have to fight with piercing the can and having it come loose half way through the opening process and turns so easily a child could operate it. EXCELLENT Quality."
5,Deserves more than 5 stars..........,I bought this to replace a new electric hand held opener that had been stashed away for years (it operated so slow I figured a manual one would be faster). The OXO opener is absolutely so easy for my arthritic hands to use. A little pricey compared to the model under it but I keep mine on the counter top so this one really looks nice. VERY satisfied.
5,Excellent ...,"I wish everything worked as well as this can opener.It uses very little effort, and makes the act of opening a can stupid easy.The handle is comfortable, beyond anything I have ever used before, and I expect it will outlast 99% of the electrics on the market.There might possibly be better can openers out there, but I won't be bothering to look for them.As a carpal tunnel sufferer, I recommend this tool to save some pain.Probably works well for arthritis sufferers too.Puts the fun back into opening cans ... if that ever existed."
5,Very well built.,I just received it today. Everthing I've read about it is great. The old can openers wear out too quick.
2,Was OK but did not last,Worked great for about 4 months then just stopped working. not sure whats going on but I switched to electric.
3,Just Okay,Opens cans fine. Not the comfort grip I expected.Chinese components...I've seen this type in retailstores since ordering this for half the price.
5,Simply Amazing!,"Wow - even my 3 yr old can open cans now.Before buying this, I bought cheap ones at walmart that required ALOT of force to open the cans.I highly recommend the OXO can opener! My fingers are happy now... :)"
5,Makes opening cans a pleasure,I looked into getting an electric opener but am happy with this simpleand extremely easy to use opener. A must for any kitchen.
5,Love this can opener,"I have purchased this can opener a month ago and I really like it. I have not had any problems with it so far. It is very easy to use and does not 'slip' off the can like a lot of other can openers do. When I make soup, I open a lot of cans. My husband has commented that is makes opening cans very easy. It is very easy to clean also. (I use a dish pan.) I'll try it out for a few more months and if it works as good as it does now, I'll be ordering more for gifts."
5,Best I have ever used.,"This is the best, easiest and fastest can opener I have used.I will never buy another kind again. I imagine it is something to do with the shape of the dial and the sharpness of the blade. I don't know and I don't care. All I know is that I love this can opener."
5,best can opener i have ever used.,this is the best can opener i have ever used. it is extremely easy to use. it does not leave sharp edges and the grip is very good. the blade is very sharp and never slips once secured properly on the can.
2,Not used many times but its a wow..Now it got rusted.,"I did not used many times Oxo steel can opener, because I am not good fan of using can foods much, but everytime I used it, this thing works well. I owned 2 different can openers before from other companies, but they just did not last no more than 3 or 4 months and also they got rusted. I ordered this product after reading reviews.This is an update after using 1 year of use. I hardly use this product for opening tomato sauce cans and it got rusted after couple of uses. I tried so many ways to clean but it is not working. This is not much worth of buying. I only give 2 stars because it is cutting cans well."
2,Not quite up to OXO standards,"I wanted to wait to give this some usage before reviewing. Now that we have used it for six months, we have ordered a replacement. It works well, but now has a nice crop of rust. When it comes to can openers and being around industrial openers for decades, I was surprised by how quickly this one rusted. When washed, we hand dry them, so there is a design element that allows this to retain some moisture in the cutting mechanism. Sadly, there is no way to save it."
5,Best can opener,I have been through a million can openers and for some reason have had the worst luck with them. This can opener is durable and cuts through cans like butter.
2,About Year Rusted,"Oddly enough it rusts in only two places. One place you can scrub off the rust with a brush. However, it also rusts in place where the little sharp wheel is connected. There is a small hole (you can see it in the picture) and it's gotten so bad in there that it's about to rust through. I gave it two stars because it is extremely functional and easy to use. But I can't for the life of me understand why they would design this so that the reverse side of the cutting wheel is exposed inside a small hole?"
2,"When it worked, it worked well, but...","When my old Zyliss gave up the ghost I looked about for a replacement. I have other OXO products and am pleased with them, so I gave this a flyer. On the plus side, it's sturdy and very easy to operate. However, I found that most of the time, about four cans out of five, it wouldn't cut the lid completely off. I'd be left with a lid slightly immersed in the can's contents and attached by a small strand of metal. I'd then have to get a small knife or fork to pry the lid out of the can and was still left with the task of getting the lid off the can without cutting myself.Based on the other reviews I'm figuring I just got a dud, so I'll replace it with another OXO opener, but not this one."
3,Would be better with all-stainless construction,"The cutting wheel assembly and handle grips are made of stainless steel, but most of the rest of the can opener is plain old chrome-plated steel. So this part rusts, just like the can openers of yore. It works well --it rusts. I am a big fan of Oxo products, but was disappointed in the construction of this one."
3,"Works great for awhile, then stops working after a year","I bought this can opener a little more than a year ago. And it was great, so smooth in opening cans. But then all of a sudden with no warning, it won't turn any more. I'm reduced to just pressing down and then going around and around the can. It's so no worth the extra money."
1,Not dishwasher-safe,"This may be a very good opener; but the description of it being dishwasher-safe is false. The description that is attached to the opener clearly states: ""Hand wash only."" I was very disappointed because I bought it based on it being dishwasher-safe."
1,oxo can opener,"I have had to buy 2 new can openers in the last 6 months---mainly because of absolutely inferior design, construction and workmanship. The OXO is the second of them. I open just regular cans---this piece of junk was stiff and difficult from day one ---it would leave a razor-sharp burr in the rim of the can at the end of the cut that would draw blood when you touch it ---without exception, on EVERY can. After 2 months the twist-handle stripped and the unit became worthless. My OXO does not look like the OXO in the pic---I probably got some Chinese garbage knock-off--who knows? Disgusted and a waste of money. Give me a !@#$%^& American made can opener from the 70's ANY day!"
1,Not As Advertised,"This Oxo can opener is not as advertised by Amazon. I purchased an Oxo smooth edge can opener a few months ago and my wife likes it very much. So we decided to give one to my mother in law as a Christmas gift. Again I researched can openers on Amazon and clicked on smooth edge can openers and this one popped up on the page. No where in the description did it mention that it was not a smooth edge can opener. Another fault is that it is billed as being dishwasher safe, yet on the product label it clearly states ""hand wash only"".I expected better from Amazon and I am really disappointed Amazon didn't do a better job describing this product. With the cost of this opener being what it is it should be what it is stated to be."
3,Works great but...,...probably because it's new. I got it because of the reviews others have left but I don't see much difference between this can opener and one from a .99 cents store except for maybe the way it looks. Too expensive if you ask me...
3,"lightweight, but ok","well i like my women with meat on, not too much, not too little. this thing is just a tad on the skinny model side of life. so i am not too sure of it's life-span. from the heft and feel. maybe a few years. my old one was ok, but while on the downhill side of life, a big handle is of value (torque is good), so tis is a replacement. the old one is still alive and sharp and does a bang up job, save the torque thing. now i am ok with miss runway, but like a glamour gal she is on the pricey side...oh i'd say 8-9bucks would be a real deal. 15, well i am not shouting out in glee 'look how much i paid'."
5,Better than electric!,"I bought this after my electric can opener died. I bought it based on the great reviews I read on Amazon, and I couldn't agree more with them. It's so easy to turn that its actually faster than an electric opener. And its dishwasher safe. I love it!"
5,OXO steel can opener is excellent!!,Best can opener we've ever had (and at age 62 we've had many). Very Highly recommended. Works smooth and effortlessly.
5,Good Manual Can Opener,"Remember, in a power outage, the manual can opener still works, heh. And they are quieter. This one is so much better than the cheap types I've subjected myself to in the past. This one opens cans when I squeeze and turn the finger-friendly handle - that's all I wanted, and that's what I got. Stainless and easy to clean. It looks nice enough to hang up. Very satisfied."
5,Off the grid,"I would never guess that a hand can opener is easier to use over an electric. Once you use this, you will NEVER want to use anything else. I find myself buying canned stuff over fresh stuff just to use this....ok not really but it's that dang good!"
1,"Horrible, Miserable Failure, I Hate This Product","The lid in the first can I tried to open did not detach. The lid hung on by a thin piece of metal. Pure failure if you asked me. That's why I bought this thing, so it would detach the lid. The results of this opener are no different from the cheap $3 grocery store opener. Pure suck."
3,Product Description?,"Amazon.com review under product desciption says this can opener is ""dishwasher-safe."" However, the directions on the attached display card says ""hand wash only."" We bought two because of the dishwasher-safe feature."
2,Don't believe what you read,"Yes, it is a can opener. Yes, it opens cans.... But the item description says that it is dishwasher safe. The first thing I noticed when I recieved it was that it says ""Hand wash only"". I might return it, but I need a can opener."
2,The $10 opener that I have does a better job,these are hard to handle and keep coming off the can. I wouldn't buy them again
2,Highly overrated,"I purchased this item hoping it would be substantially better than the electric can opener. In reality, this hand held one is no better than the electric one that you can buy at walmart for less than $10. It takes more effort to open a can using this opener and if a can has a small 'lip' i.e. the vertical border on which these openers attach, this item does not work at all!!I would not recommend anybody waste their money on this product."
5,This thing is a beast,"We went through several $5 can openers before springing for the more expensive OXO -- our big dog food cans wore them out (and hurt our hands). This thing cuts through those cans like a warm knife through butter.It's worth the investment, folks."
5,love this can opener,Have had several garbage can openers and finally one that works!Opens with no problem. Highly recommend this can opener.
4,Oxo Can Opener,"Very easy to use, operates smoothly, doesn't require a lot of pressure to turn, comfortable handle. Only negative if not dried right away starts to rust."
5,Best can opener ever!,The title of my review says it all: this is the best can opener ever. Each turn is like a little slice of heaven. I don't really know what else to say about it other than it does its job amazingly and I love it.
5,Another great product from OXO,"I must admit that this not the exact OXO can opener that I have. Mine is exactly like it except it has the soft handles - not like the less expensive model with the bottle opener. Otherwise mine is identical and I wouldn't be able to function in the kitchen without it. I've had mine for about 3 or 4 years - maybe longer - time flies. I saw where only a few reviewers were disappointed. I don't understand how that could be possible. Like another reviewer, I grew tired of electric can openers that eventually wouldn't hold onto the can while cutting the lid or the blade would become dull or bent so it was useless. Also, got tired of taking up counter space. I don't think anyone will be sorry for buying this can opener. It's well worth every penny."
5,An amazing can-opener,"My family opens many cans. Many of our previous can openers would leave us struggling to open a two-third opened can before it gave out and was impossible to use. This can opener has no problems. It opens cans smoothly. The turning mechanism is large and easy to grip while turning, and the blades do a great job of opening cans (and has done so in the six months). The handles are thick and heavy, which makes everyone that uses it feel like it will last for a long time unlike most other cheap openers.Absolutely worth it. If you've struggled with can openers before, you won't get too much better than this one."
5,Great product,Works great easy to use opens can all the way.Very heavy duty steel should last for many years to come.
4,good but not special,"I have used swing-a-way brand openers for 30 years and they haven't changed a bit. This product is similar but slightly better, I think because of sharper blades. Like many oxo products it is overpriced but if you forget that you will like it for a long whileOne off for price"
5,Great look and light weight,I went from an electric to this product and I have no regrets. It fits great in the utensil drawer and looks great with everything else that is stainless steel in my kitchen. Also a very good price.
5,WJG,Best can opener I have ever used. Plus my wife doesn't complain about opening cans anymore. Very good product.
2,Was good for two monthsI,"I had this opener for about two months when it didn't open a can this morning and I had to fish out my old one which did the job. It's a good thing I saved my old one just in case. I was surprised since Oxo is usually a good product. Unfortunately, I cannot return it. Lesson learned on that one."
4,Better than most,"This can opener is better than any I have owned previously, but not perfect. After a year or so, the gear mechanism is starting to slip when I first start turning the handle. Also, the opener does leave a little strip of metal between the can and the lid, as some other reviewers have mentioned. This is not a good thing, since sometimes the little strip falls into the can when I twist or bend the lid to completely separate it. However, I have never owned one that doesn't do this."
2,Spend the money on a mani/pedi,"This is one book best left to be watched as a pointless, plotless, poor lifetime original movie.I was so hopeful for this book and eager to devour each page for a tell-all story of teen angst and juicy naughty deeds done for the sake of popularity.Instead I got a never-completely explained heroine and boring story. The story lacks heart, passion and a point. Don't read it as the cover is truly ""cooler"" than the book."
1,bad book for pre-teens,"This is X-rated for pre-teens and high school girls. I got in so much trouble for sneaking it from my friend to read. Now, I am grounded for the summer.Thank you to the stupid author who made the cover look like this book was ok for someone my age to read."
3,slow to start slow to end,This book had some really boring points even though there is some oh my god kind of monents but i dont think it was very good overall.
1,Horrible book,"I can't will myself to finish this book! After reading the reviews, I have decided to put this one down. What I found so interesting is that most of the negative reviewers had only rated this or maybe one other book. Perhaps they felt as strongly as I do (as I have never written a review before) that this book is a waste of time you NEED to tell someone????"
1,Bad choice of setting,"I am from South Bend too and this author can go to hell on a hopscotch pad.Who doe s/ he think he is writing about a nice town that way. Funny thing is I bet h/she could not even point out South Bend on a map. This story is so unrealistic. Both of my brothers attended Wayland Academy (private prep school in WI) and both went to Harvard.. YES, South Bend does produce smart children from wealthy families. Ever hear of Studebaker, Curtis? Also, the writing is average. Try again."
3,Not what I had expected,"This was a pretty good book, but I just kept waiting for something to happen. The main character is sad, depressing and not very likeable."
1,Oh dear....,"I normally do not feel compelled to write a review on Amazon once I have read a book, but this book causes me to change my mind. The protaganist of the book, Lee, is generally very unlikeable. She is whiney and often rude, and completely unmotovated to do anything. Half of the book she barely even has friends. She is surrounded by characters who are shallow and very two dimentional to make things even better.Besides the characters, the basis for the book bothered me a lot as well. The fact that people might think this is an acurate portrayal of a prestigious boarding school is horrifying to think about. Sittenfeld does not include a single believable character in the story and clearly draws on some bad experience she had in her life. Her characters are uninteresting and her idea of boarding school life is completely off. I would never recommend this book to anyone."
2,an unlikable character. . .,"I couldn't connect with Lee Fiora on any level- she would have been sympathetic if she had any likable characteristics what-so-ever. She never had any moments of growth and all her personal reflection (ad naseum) did nothing but contribute to her lack of self-esteem. While the book was extremely readable, I never found myself rooting for her, it was more like I was extremely embarrassed for her. It was kind of like looking through someone's dirty laundry hamper."
4,Very Entertaining,"I really enjoyed this novel, even though some of the chapters were a little too long. I really liked how readers are shown a bit of the future, which helps to satisfy that, ""What happens next?"" obsession that at least I have.Overall, the book was entertaining and a quick read. While it didn't address the ideas of race, etc as described on the jacket and the climax comes rather late in the story, I enjoyed it and would recommend it to my friends."
2,"Unlikable Characters, weak story","This book was hard to read because I never developed a liking for the characters. The main character was as awkward when she graduated as when she was a freshman. The story read like one humiliating and uncomfortable scene after another, with no real closure or progress."
2,Self loathing at its lowest...,"At first I loved this novel, expecting the main character to really develop and blossom and to learn more about what is actually happening in her life rather than the inane thoughts that run through her head. The story was rather boring and I found myself wanting to learn more about the other characters than about her, I wish the writer had done this book from the perspective of anyone else but the person she actually chose. This girl made herself awkward and brought herself down more than any other character. I also agree with the person who pointed out how the author attempted to promote every given stereotype, the Jewish girl who has to get a nose job, the token black that does the Uncle Tom skit, the Asian girl with the ""weird"" food and the Hispanic girls with bad makeup and clothes. A true waste of potential."
2,Well-written but dull,"This book is undeniably well-written. But a novel also needs interesting characters and intriguing plot development. I found that ""Prep"" lacked both. There are literally places in the book where you can skip several pages and not miss a single important story point. Above in one of the editorial reviews it is noted that the narrator, Lee, ""sees herself as 'one of the mild, boring, peripheral girls' among her privileged classmates."" She is indeed that. I don't read novels to read about mild, boring, peripheral characters. With all the undeserved comparisons to Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" being made, I'd suggest reading that instead."
1,Kindle version too expensive!!!!!!!,"I wanted to read this on my Kindle but why would I pay $11.99 to read it on my Kindle when I can buy the book on Prime for $9.73/Paperback and $3.50/hardcover + free shipping? Why are Kindle books so high? Without the cost of publishing, they should be way cheaper. And this book is 7 years old."
5,Really impressed.,"Painful, cringy, funny and sad. Felt very honest. I am required to write 12 more words, so this is twelve."
4,"What ""Charlotte Simmons"" wishes it was...",Both are about small town girls gone to a more sophisticated place out of their element where they don't fit in. The difference between the two is that in Prep we are not expected to believe that any young girl could be as naive as Charlotte Simmons. Lee has just the right about of naivete and it doesn't drag on throughout the whole book regardless of her experiences.
1,Horrible.,"This book was absolutely horrible. What did the author try to describe in this book? Was this book written to give a perspective of how minorities are treated in prep school? Or to simply entertain, giving readers things to relate to the main character? If it was the first reason, the author has completely messed up, and has written it without thought or reasearch. If it was the later, this book wasn't meant to be praised by so many readers.Personally, another reason why I hated this book so much was that it was impossible to track what time period this book was set in. How many teenagers listen to Bob Dylan these days? Do you actually think someone who owns shoe factories (I would have understood if it was a computer parts factory or a car manufacturing company) in Korea would be rich these days? What is this? The 70's?Not only that, but the book was slow moving as well. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
2,A Mess,"What a disappointment. This book was a mishmash of prep school cliches. The plot was thin, the main character not at all sypathetic or even interesting. Who wants to read about a high school girl who has so little self regard that she would allow the boy she ""loves"" to use her for sex while forbidding him to acknowledge her in public, and who cheats on exams to stay in school, with no repercussions? There were multiple mixed messages but it all boiled down to BORING and TRITE. I expected more from an author with the credentials of Ms. Sittenfeld but was sorely disappointed."
2,Not a COMPLETE waste of time,"This book is a great example of an over-hyped mess. Kept me somewhat entertained, waiting for something to happen, but it never did and I completely forgot everything about the book within about an hour of finishing it. If you want to care for or feel empathy for the main character, skip Prep and try The Wonder Spot by Melissa Bank instead."
4,Completely relatable,"I read this book in such a short time. I thought Lee was a little pathetic, but she was still very young. She did care way too much about what people thought about her, but we all did that when we were in High School. It brought back memories of staring at a boy and you wanted him soo badly,but you could not have him, or he would only speak to you when the prettier girls were not around. I felt bad for Lee,and in the end, Cross ended up being a bigger jerk then i had antisipated, which most of the time the boy you loose your virginity to is. The author at the end tells you what most of the characters are doing in the present, Martha got married, Cross is also married. I kind of wish Lee got married, and got over caring about what people think to the extent she still does. Overall, I definately recommend this book to others."
1,Wish I could give it a negative star!!,"This book was one of the most boring coming-of-age novels I have ever read. Lee Fiora bored the s#*! out of me, there was poor character developement throughout the novel, and hardly any plot. Also, the writer had the annoying habit of Lee telling a story then jumping into her present life and relating the incident in the such a dry and pointless way I wanted to just slam the book shut. Lee failed to evolve in 4 yrs and I could not relate or empathyze with her in any way. The best thing about this book was that it was available @the local library and I did not have to waste mi dinero$$$"
2,"I hated the main character, and not in a good way.","There are definitely moments of cleverness and rich evocation: the names of Lee's fellow students, for one, are funny and spot-on. And the main character's best (only) friendship does effectively evoke the nuances of young female friendships. BUT: a well-drawn character who is troubled and awkward should make you want to hug them, not smack them. Lee messes up and self-sabotages so consistently -- and not in an endearing teen-angst way -- that she just gets more and more painfully irritating, willfully un-self-aware, and, frankly, pathetic, and therefore, less and less worth rooting for. In a really good book, she'd Grow and Learn From Her Experiences in subtle and unpredictable ways. In a mediocre (and way too long) book, however, she just gets buffeted about by a series of moderately skillful descriptions. I was drawn along by a few compelling plot turns (Assassin, the math test) but ultimately disappointed -- and frustrated by the excessive hype."
1,"Feelings, nothing more","Nothing in this novel is profound. Nothing in this novel is redeeming. Nothing in this novel inspires, puzzles, or educates. It is the ramblings of nothingness. Where feelings of the moment have a higher priority than values, morals, standards, virtues or ethics which, by the way, were nowhere to be found in the main character's daily struggles as an individual growing up -- only feelings.There was a little trace of regret, and only then because of its inconvenience to Lee herself, but there was no trace of shame or guilt in Lee.""Where these is yet shame, there may in time be virtue"" Dr. Johnson"
1,Poorly Written!,"Am I the only reader who found the prose ponderous, the dialogue stilted, and the whole thing badly in need of editing? I am amazed at the status this book has achieved, and doubly amazed that anyone would utter Salinger and Sittenfeld in the same breath. Read the prose out loud to yourself: are these long, wordy, rhythm-less sentences pleasing to the ear? Read the dialogue out loud to yourself: does anyone really talk like that, and do we need to have every single tedious, expository word in every conversation? At the end of Chapter 2, where was an editor to cut out the second half of the last sentence? (We get it!)Really, why is such schlock getting such praise?"
1,annoying and boring,"This book is awful. Such a waste of money. Lee is extremely insecure and can't even have a normal conversation with anyone. For four years, all she does is sit in her room and do absolutely nothing other than think about and judge her classmates. She somehow forgets she's at a boarding school and needs to study and makes awful grades. She has a huge crush on the most popular guy in her grade and one night he magically appears in her room which starts a series of hook-ups. She basically lets him use her. Seriously, save your money and don't waste your time."
2,Lead Character Annoying,"I find it hard to stay interested in a book where you can't identify with the main character in anyway. And this was the case in this book. All I could think the entire time was that teenage angst was way overdone. The story of trying to fit into the popular crowd is one that has been done many times before, and in a more entertaining way. Not one of my favorite reads, that's for sure."
2,I've read random blogs better than this,"The narrator/heroine/protagonist - and I'm stretching it by applying the latter two terms to Lee Fiora - is an overwhelmingly one-note character. Over four years, she manages not to evolve or change in any way, good or bad. Her detached insecurity is annoying rather than endearing. She observes people rather than interacts with them, which is just as well, because the other characters in the book are pretty boring and one-note as well. I can't think of any redeeming qualities for Lee - she lacks ambition, is jealous of her friends, and [spoiler alert!] can't find the courage to initiate a daytime conversation with the young man who climbs into her bed and has sex with her at night. (Don't get excited - you have to wade through the first 3/4 of the book to get to anything that remotely interesting.) Most of the scenes begin with such gripping openings as ""The night of the fire drill ... "" Save your money and your time."
2,YOUNG ADULT FICTION,"What does it say about the state of American literature that this book is hailed as adult literary fiction? I mean come on, this is a Young Adult book, a good YA book but not for grownups. NO WAY. I started this book with great hope, but halfway through--when the embarassing juvenile sex scenes started--I got really bored, (is this her diary from prep school?) and realized that nothing meaningful or interesting was going to happen. The realization that prep school is full of preppy--get it, prep-py people is no surprise, and neither is the fact that there are differences between rich people and middle class people!!! If you are a teenager, read this book, if you are an adult looking for a high school graduation present, buy this book. Otherwise, pass it up."
1,terrible book,"I thought ""Prep"" did not give an accurate description of what boarding school life is about. It made boarding school seem overly cliche, and a place where only the rich and the elitest are schooled. The boarding school that Sittenfield created is one that is seen in movies, not real life. If Sittenfield spent more time at boarding schools today, she would realize that her description of boarding school is inaccurate, and poor kids who are sent to boarding schools do not automatically become outcasts. A reader might enjoy this book if he/she has never been to or heard of a boarding school; if the reader has, he/she will find it ridiculous."
2,Very disappointing,"Many other reviewers have already mentioned my chief problems with this book: #1, that the main character/narrator was a neurotic and completely unlikable cipher; and #2, that none of the other characters are really well developed. Ms. Sittenfeld was fairly accurate in her depiction of prep-school life -- I'll give her that. But for a much more interesting look at prep school, and getting inside the mind of a messed-up prep-school student, read Sean Wilsey's memoir, ""Oh the Glory of it All."" (And Wilsey's book is a fabulous read for other reasons, too.)"
1,Awful!,"I heard and read so much about this book. But that's not why I hated it. I hated it because it was absolutely awful. This is the worst first person narrative I've ever read. And I've read a lot, trust me. The narrator and plot are flat, flat, flat. My feeling about this novel and the narrator was who cares? If you want to read about adolescent angst don't waste your time with this - read or reread ""Catcher on the Rye."" The few times Holden rants about prep school will tell you all you need to know. What a waste of money! This was such a dull read I don't even want to torture anyone by giving it away."
1,Not what I had hoped for at all!,"I really like the teen books, but this was a disappointment. I didn't get very far before I felt that there were things that I didn't want to read about. There were too many mentions of things that I didn't want to be hearing about, sex, and names of things that I just didn't want in a book. I read for entertainment, not education. If I had kids, I would not want them reading this."
1,Slow and tedious,"From reading the back of the book, I was very excited to dive right into it. As I did so, I grew tired of how Lee prejudged everyone and everything and was nieve to the world around her. Yes, she was supposed to be 13 when she went to school, but the character should have matured slightly over the 4 years.The plot was slow and dragging although the writing was on target with what I expected.In the end, I was disappointed because I had begun reading this book with such high hopes, but by the end of the first chapter, I was bored."
2,What was the NYT thinking?!,"The only reason I am giving this book 2 stars is because I think the author did a great job of portraying prep school life with all it's bizzare traditions (the green jacket, etc). However, that was probably the only good thing about this book. It got off to a good start, but half way through I was asking myself what I had done. Lee Fiora came across as a total snot. I tried in desperation to like her, but I could not. From her general ""whatever"" attitude about life, to the way she treated her parents, she came across as a very shallow human being.I though the sex scenes were gratuitous. Were they really necessary? This book was terribly formulaic. Awkward, shy girl wins over the handsome, sexy popular boy. Real life could not be further from the truth. Give me a break. Bottom line, stay away from this book."
2,An insider gets inside reviews,"If someone without connections had written this book, it would not have been published let alone lauded by all the critics. This is clearly a derivative, dull, prep school girl's memoirs. I don't care if she did come from Indiana, she's another prep school girl, in love with the rich despite disclaiming it. It is so overwritten, it's practically unreadable. Shame on the critics who fell for it."
2,I really wanted to like this book ...,"... and I wanted to root for the protagonist, but I just couldn't get behind her or any of the characters. Nobody was very likable, particularly Lee. Also, I had a hard time getting past some of the characters' unusual names--Gates, Hunter, Devin, Dede, Darden, Cross, Aspeth, Aubrey, Little, Horton, etc. I suspect these choices were deliberate on the author's part and that they might reflect the kinds of names you'd find in an East Coast boarding school, but I found them distracting.The last chapter was depressing, and I was glad when it was all over. Still, Sittenfeld is a great writer and I'd be willing to give her a chance again."
1,wish i'd watched tv,"Another reviewer mentioned how unlikable the main character is. I agree. Also, the navel-gazing, woe-is-I tone gets old well before the story ends. A forgettable book."
2,Interesting read but not sure why it was listed at top 10 book,"This was not my favorite book but it gave an interesting perspective. It is probably a worthwhile read for parents of tweens and teenagers who want to get a better idea of what is going through their kid's minds.It was hard for me to get past the maturity that the main character Lee Fiora had for certain people skills which seemed well beyond her age which made the story somewhat unrealistic. For example, in her thoughts about when Martha was telling her something she didn't agree with she would say to herself I didn't say anything because that would mean that Martha would stop being so honest with me. It is hard for me to imagine that Lee is so mature in this perspective when she is so immature (as most teenagers are) in other regards.I think there are much better books out there that I would recommend like The Kite Runner, The Poisonwood Bible, and The Time Traveller's Wife."
1,Spread the word,DUMBEST BOOK I READ ALL YEARThis book was boring. The writing was bad and the author insults anyone from South Bend Indiana.
1,I just wasted a week of my life reading this.,"If you are interested in reading 400+ pages waiting for a plot to form, you might like this book. Overall, this is a book (I couldn't even say ""story"") about an insecure adolescent who thinks absurdly too much and says/does absolutely nothing. I would guesstimate that if you were to combine all conversations the main character, Lee, spoke in the book, it would not total 3 pages."
1,The Shampoo Bottle Is More Interesting Than This,I was soooooooo disgusted with this piece of so a called literature. I would suggest the author Curtis Sittenfield find herself a name that matches her gender. Them I would suggest she invest in a bottle of shampoo and get some advice from that. You could also bring a bottle of your favorite shampoo and read that in the bathroom instead.
3,Preppy.,"""Prep"" wasn't great. It chronicles Lee Fiora's life over four years at boarding school. Lee was insecure and shy, like a lot of the characters teenagers read about. Because of this I thought I'd be able to relate to her, but I didn't at all. She annoyed me so much throughout the whole book that I had trouble reading it. She was one of those characters that I just wanted to scream at for being so flawed. Maybe that's not fair, but Lee was supposed to be the character you support, and all she did was frustrate me.Other than that, it wasn't bad. There was no real plot line, but I was fine with that, because it was more of a ""character development"" book. But it is not a book I'll read again, mostly because Lee Fiora is probably the most annoying character I've ever had the misfortune to read about."
3,Similar to reality. I think parents should read it if you're considering sending kids to boarding school.,"Some parts of it kind of dragged on and I'm not so sure about the ending. I wished it had more of a closure although her life isn't really over.I went to a very exclusive private school and graduated in early the 90s. I could absolutely relate to how she felt. I, like her was the one who wanted to go but, I could not relate my problems to anyone because it was the choice I had made and there were sacrifices made. Luckily I didn't fall too behind in school but I could have done better overall in life had I went elsewhere at the time.It's not that I didn't get anything out of it but I would have been happier. You get something out of every experience.I think it's really the parents of teenagers who should read it. Had I read it earlier in life, I think I would have cried my eyes out."
3,Interesting but somewhat stereotypical,"I bought ""Prep"" because my son will be going to boarding school. I found it interesting but thematically very similar to every WB-T.V. series with a interesting yet alienated teenager meeting snobby rich kids and a sex-crazed shallow basketball player. I enjoyed it for the quick read, but I don't really think I learned anything new."
1,Boring!,"I was really disappointed in this novel, especially after reading all the hype in the NYT. I found Lee, the main character, to be remarkably unchanged throughout her prep school career. She was ""sad and angry"" throughout the whole book and nothing -- not friendship, rejection, embarrassment, or humiliation -- fundamentally affected her. Also, as the parent of a boarding school student, I found the portrayal of her relationship with her parents profoundly misleading. Lee's inability to relate to her family was not because she was a boarding school student; she couldn't even relate to other boarding school students!! Lee seemed to have personality disorders that preceded Ault, but the author didn't acknowledge that."
5,Favorite book ever,"Wonderfully written, it definitely brings back all those memories of high school. All the happiness, the pain, the heartaches, the need to fit in, Lee's account of her time at Ault is a great backdrop for this poignant coming-of-age time in our lives."
4,Right On,This gets at the heart of teenage insecurities so well! You will find yourself remembering exactly what it is like to wonder if someone thinks your joke is funny or if anyone will ever discover who you TRULY are. I really enjoyed the memories this conjured up in me and it reminded me how hard it is to be a young person and how our insecurities become more complex as we get older - but they don't really go away. Sittenfeld is terrific at the art of characterization!
4,Curtis Sittenfeld is an author to watch,"The author's style of writing was engaging and authentic. Her characters are real,there were so many moments when i was reading the book that i was like, yes exactly! i thought i was the only one who thinks like that.i liked how the book wasn't glossy fluff, don't expect to read a charming tale about a poor girl who finds the love of her life and eventually becomes queen of the school. the book was authentic almost to the point where sometimes i wish that the protaganist got a little break but sittenfeld is an amazing writer. i can't wait to see what else she writes."
2,this was a disappointment,"Like most of the others, I read this because of all the hype, and because the author was coming to speak at my school's bookstore. Lee, the main character, got obnoxious after the first hundred pages or so, and there were so many incidental characters that I couldn't keep track of their importance. I read the whole book, including the last half excitedly, because I thought that certainly Lee would undergo some major change that would make her see how wrong about everything she was. I was disappointed at the end that nothing occurred. I read the last page three times to see if I'd missed something, but I don't think I did. It's ok, but the static character and the racism and stereotypes means I won't be recommending this book to anyone I know."
4,Successful,"Sittenfeld tries to emulate Holden Caufield in this book and it's easy to say that she succeeds in doing so. Although many books have been written in a similar vein this one stands out because Sittenfeld accurate portreys the character of a teenager. It doesn't even matter that the character is a girl and this novel is just as accessible to guys as to girls. I knew many girls in high school who were like this character. She reminded me of many of them in terms of her humour and self-consciousness. Overall the book is quite funny and it's an easy summer read for the cottage or the beach. I'd recommend it for all ages, and for anyone who looks back upon their teenage years with fondness or with dread."
4,Reliving the horrors of being a teenage girl,"If I ever consider sending my child to prep school, I hope someone will remind me to re-read this book. It's a very engaging story about one young woman's painful experience at prep school, especially if you've ever been an outsider in the world of the truly rich. I found this much more captivating than Tom Wolfe's I am Charlotte Simmons, which takes a naive young woman to a ""Duke-esque"" school. Both books are good reads if only to make me very, very glad that I'm no longer a teenage girl. (Hmmmm. Maybe I should add Smashed: Story of a Drunken Girlhood to that group!)"
3,Raw nerve (leafy aura?),"Sittenfeld has conveyed the emotional mindset of a sensitive, unhappy adolescent girl as perhaps no writer before her. So well does the book immerse the reader in the feelings of a high school misfit, that prolonged exposure becomes uncomfortable, calling forth the inevitable unhappy memories.This feat is tempered somewhat by the lack of a plot (other than the passing of time) and the aggressive unpleasantness of all the characters (except Lee's wonderful father, the only character with a discernable heartbeat).Whether Sittenfeld's accomplishment resonates with you will depend on how long you can bear to be in the raw, sensitive, overheated mind of Sittenfeld's Lee Fiora. I was impressed for about 150 pages."
3,Dissapointing End,"Though the book had well-developed characters and generally realistic situations, the character's atitude thoroughly depressed me and annoyed me at the same time. However, some parts were interesting and made me laugh, but the ending was a dissapointment and made me wonder, what was the whole point of this book?"
4,Excellent first novel--uncanny in its accuracy,"""Prep"" has, like no other novel in recent memory, managed to make me squirm in embarrassment and recognition. Transfer Lee's four years of boarding school to four years of college and, eerily, that was my experience. It's both a delight and a terror to encounter one's feelings and thoughts articulated so perfectly. As I read, I was transported back to those four tumultuous years when you can't see the forest for the trees. Strangely, I am unable to maintain a decently objective distance from this novel--is it good because it's good on its own merits, or because I am awed by the experience of reading it? What I am struck by is the knowledge that these events are being narrated by an older Lee, at some point in the future--watching how that fact colors the stories she tells (most of sophomore year is missing, for example) and how she tells them. In all, a fabulous debut."
1,"Plotless, with 1-dimensional characters...","I'll admit right here that I couldn't even get through the book. I simply couldn't deal with Lee's snobbishness and isolation. The entire book appeared to be an inner-monologue of angst. It was painful to see Lee brush off friendly overtures again and again, and then to blame those who made them for being too stand-offish.I don't know if Grotton has changed any since the author went there; as a (boarding) prep school student on half-scholarship myself, I can say that I've never encountered the level of self-absorbed angst Lee exhibits through all four years. A girl who doesn't manage to change in four years should never have won that scholarship."
2,'I Am Charlotte Simmons' redux,"Perhaps I would have liked this book if I hadn't read ""I Am Charlotte Simmons"" so recently (last year). I didn't much care for ""Simmons,"" but I pushed through it, determined to finish. 50 pages into ""Prep"" I felt like I was reading ""Simmons"" part 2 and couldn't go on. It is very similar in tone and writing style as well as plot. If you loved ""Simmons"" then you'll probably love ""Prep,"" too. If you didn't care for the former, however, I suggest skipping the later."
2,The NY Times was wrong,"As you've already read, Lee Fiora was entirely unlikable with zero redeeming qualities. I'm completely alright with hating the protagonist, (Bella from Twilight anyone? Ugh.) But Lee is just too much. I can't say anything interesting happened to herin the 4 years, because she was too boring and afraid to interact with anyone.The other characters were so poorly developed that the only way you could keep track of them was because they had stupid names like ""Cross"" ""Aspeth"" ""Horton"" ""Darden"" ""Dede""It makes you wonder about the author...All that education, and still uses ignorant stereotypes and sophmoric writing. No thanks!"
2,"So many books, so little time","Sorry to say I got only about 100 pages into this book before I abandoned it. I really wanted to like it because the premise was intriguing --- ordinary girl from Indiana gets scholarship to an elite boarding school on the East Coast, but unfortunately the characters never sprang to life. The writing itself was pretty good, but I had to keep reminding myself that this was supposed to be about kids in high-school, not college, since the characters spoke and acted more like 18 than 14. This had bothered me all the way through, but when the main character Lee said something about someone ""sporting a mustache"", I gave up. So many books, so little time."
3,Well Prepared in Parts,"In this coming of age story, an ordinary girl fights to succeed in the most extraordinary environment. Fourteen-year-old scholarship student Lee attempts to achieve greatness by enrolling in a prestigious boarding school. Besides the typical teenage girl drama (read boys and friends), she ends up battling mediocrity, loneliness, and class issues.Lee is written with an authenticity that will make you cringe as she conjures memories of you as a high school student. She's written with the unmistakable blend of vulnerability, narcissism, and naiveté that defines the teenage girl. The novel is undeniably chick lit, and may not offer much to the male reader, but is a relatable and modern coming of age novel."
3,Plot? What Plot?,"The good thing about this story was that the author definetely has potential. She writes beautifully, with realistic situations and people. So the start of the novel was promising.Then, it soon became apparent that the novel wasn't going anywhere. The main problem was that it tried too hard to be philosophical or moral-y. And Lee, the protagonist, was a total slacker. The end."
1,A disappointment,"""Prep"" was overlong, and I found the prose to be unoriginal and the tone and setting to be underdeveloped. Lee is an incredibly uninteresting and unlikable narrator. There were repetitions of certain small details that made me feel the book was inattentively edited.Additionally, the time period was unspecific; elements eventually pointed to the 80s, but I don't believe that the phrase ""hooking up"" was used then to describe sex or making out.I don't get why the NY Times picked this as a notable book. I found it tedious and pedestrian."
2,Climax?,"This book was rather engrossing initially. The author gives good details on the characters and you can almost picture them--with the exception of the main character, Lee Fiore. Lee's physical appearance is unknown, but her personality is bland, and her character weak.I kept waiting for the story to build to a climax, but it never left the ground. It was pointless--Lee went to school, and left school.Utterly boring."
1,bad,"extremely untrue. Don't expect to gain insight about boarding school from this novel. I currently attend a boarding school in CT, and find this novel to be extremely biased, untruthful, and obnoxious. All of my friends who read it hated it."
3,"Good character development, unnecessary scenes","I enjoyed the character and plot development that Sittenfeld was able to provide. While reading, this development helped me feel as if I truly were experiencing life through the eyes of Lee, the main character. The one thing that made me dislike the book, however, are the graphic sex scenes toward the end of the novel. I found them to be unnecessarily graphic which I was unprepared for. These scenes lessened my opinion of the book."
4,Good prose balanced with light fare,"Prep is a well written coming of age story that is writtem for a ""contemporary"" audience. (If you wonder what I mean by coontemporary, think of the beautiful but somehow forgetable writing of The Lovely Bones.) But this is a coming of age story, not the sort of journalistic view presented by Tom Wolfe in I Am Charlotte Simmons, and readers will therefore feel the angst and uncertainty of growing up, a la Catcher In The Rye or a new book called The Big Kids which also does the genre justice. There will be complaints about whether this book accurately gets at boarding school life, but come on, it's fiction! Prep could have been deeper or broader, but it's still a decent read."
2,Shallow,"Sittenfield writes about the age old story of an outsider entering the cliquish world of affluent teenagers at a private boarding school in New England. This book follows the story of Lee, the outsider, through her 4 years at ""Ault"". However, Lee never grows as a person or a character; she remains shallow and immature throughout the novel. This book, like the main character, lacks depth and meaning."
2,A reaffirming YA read and nothing more,"Before starting this book, I finished Oh The Glory of It All by Sean Wilsey. I read Oh the Glory because of Curtis Sittenfeld's recommendation on NPR.Oh the Glory is probably the best thing I got out of Sittenfeld. Please read that book.Sittenfeld has a knack for putting into the words the simple things humans feel and think but don't realize they think and feel. She's not a writer devoid of observation, but Prep has no redeeming qualities.It's true that Lee Fiora is awkward and self-concious like most teens are. But who the hell wants to re-live those painfully awkward and overly self-judgemental times of their lives? Especially when there is no pay-off in sight.Prep should be in the Young Adult section and I'm not sure why it's not."
2,One Silly Book,"I had hoped to find a book that would somehow continue the serious social criticism and art of Tom Wolfe's ""I am charlotte Simmons"". Instead I found this superficial, politically correct fluffed up fantasy version of pseudo elite culture, equivilent to a true romance type genre...shallowly written for those who don't want to think...nothing wrong with that I have my own favorite fluff novels...but let us not pretend that this book is anything more than continuation of a superficial version of angst for those who write professional reviews. You can do as well reading a magazine, watching some tv show or the like. This is not a book for a reader looking for literature, art or challenge. Why do the professional reviewers beat the drum for this drivel?"
3,Portrait of an Avoidant Personality,"I was hoping for a coming-of-age book in a setting with which I was familiar. Although much of the setting was very familiar and really rang true, there was no personal growth in the main character. I loved the references to ""morning meetings"", adoration of ""the seniors"" and the ""pet words""(patina). Unfortunately, that was were my experience and Lee's diverged. If I had known I was reading a book about a person with an avoidant personality disorder and how she dealt with the stress of prep school, I think I would have enjoyed the book more. Instead, I was sold a coming-of-age book, where the main character was trapped in her disease and never grew up.We did have a great discussion in my book club about this book though."
1,talented but terrible,"To be perfectly honest, I had expected a far better book than that of the one I read. While Ms. Sittenfeld clearly has talent, I did not enjoy her book. It was slow, even over exagerated. I, being in high school, know exactly what it's like. And no, it is NOT that bad all the time. And the character, Lee, was just poorly outlined. Especially by falling for Cross. I also hated the in depth portrayal of intimacies. For pity's sake, leave me with a somewhat purer mind than that. So, in conclusion, I did not enjoy this book, nor would I recommend it to anyone. I do not mean to insult Ms. Sittenfeld, however, I do believe that she could do better, and I wish her the best of luck. I hope this helped whoever reads this review."
1,DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME,"This book is pure garbage. The main character is dull, depressing and pathetic. I have not a single clue why anyone over the age of 14 would rate this book with more than one star. The rave reviews must be from friends of the author. Don't waist your time on this book. Oh, I suppose the book has one single appeal - the belt on the cover is cute."
1,grown man writes coming of age story of young girl,"I read this book, beginning with relish and ending with annoyance. It felt, overall, like Curtis imagined in his head what a NE prep school might be like without ever having visited one and then imagined what it might be like to be a young woman without ever having been one of those either. His characters are distorted cariactures with no depth and no sympathetic interest. If YOU have a high school education, I suspect this book is not for you. However, if you like insipid pop-fiction, and don't mind obvious imagery and blandly overdone comic characters, go for it."
2,"I wanted it to be good, but it wasn't.","I had high hopes for this book, but it didn't live up to even mediocre standards. It plods along steadily but follows no path. I felt like I was just waiting for something to happen. A few things happen at the very end, but they just sort of come out of nowhere. The main character is really unlikeable because she is SO anti-social and socially lame, yet blames everyone else for all her problems. If she at least developed as a character and realized what a lame dweeb she is, it would have been better."
5,incredibly engaging novel,"Prep hooked me from the first chapter - something about Sittenfield's novel is so real and engaging that it is hard to read without seeing some of yourself in the writing. Even as a college student, I felt like I could have written some the passages about my own life and experiences; Sittenfield has a gift for putting thoughts into words. The book is funny, sad, uncomfortable, awkward, but above all, real. It is filled with honesty and truth about how we grow up and come to terms with who we are versus who we want to be. I have recommended this book to several of my friends, and i have not received one negative comment back."
2,Rich kid creates a wannabe,"Very disturbing. Basically a rich kid's idea of what a ""scholarship"" kid's inner life might be like....Sittenfeld's projections into an unlikeable wannabe.No wonder we are in trouble in this country when the privileged see ""LCMs"" (the lower middle class) as lying around passively waiting to be screwed. What a metaphor!"
3,A Good Beach Read with Substance,"This novel was very fast to read and quite engrossing. Lee Fiora, the blue-collar Midwesterner on scholarship at an exclusive Massachusetts prep school, was a believable and fairly sympathetic character. Her foray into the WASP-y world of boarding school is entertaining, a little funny, and more than a little heartbreaking. The author perfectly captures that time in a teenage girl's life when she is discovering herself in relation to others: her friends, her family, and boys.I read this book in 2 days, which is actually pretty fast for me now that I have a toddler to run around after. I read it while on vacation and it was perfect for taking to the beach or lazing by the pool. At the same time, it offers more substance and heart than your average beach read. It's not a novel that will haunt you for weeks or even days after finishing it, but it's fun to read and somewhat affecting."
3,"Liked it, but...","What is is: The Nanny Diaries goes to Prep School. What it is NOT: A new Catcher in the Rye.Not even close. For a better example of Salinger, check out Andrea Siegel's vastly superior novel, LIKE THE READ PANDA.About PREP: the book certainly had its moments. It was edgy, fast-paced, and entertaining. However, a lot of the scenes felt forced and the whole ""angst"" angle was a bit overplayed. It tried too hard."
3,"Excellent writing, not the best story","I just finished this book last night and I was just happy that I got through it. The author's writing and way with words was the only thing that kept me going. The main character, Lee, was un-interesting and did nothing but basically pity herself for the entire novel. I couldn't figure out if we were supposed to feel sorry for her or not. Then there were some very descriptive intimate scenes towards the end of the book which basically just really grossed me out when I kept thinking to myself that the scenes were about two highschoolers. If you're looking for something with a real heartfelt story and a main character you will really care about, this is not the book for you. However, I would give this author another chance (with a different book)."
5,It's A Separate Peace for girls!,"I just finished reading this novel and I find that it is without a doubt one of the best novels I've read in such a long time. It is a coming of age story for a female. The angst Lee feels attending Ault is dead-on. While at times her angst gets overwhelming and exhausting to the reader, it is so realistic. That's exactly what it is like to doubt your worth and your sense of self when you feel like an outsider in a new environment. The scenes with Cross are perfect as well. The way Lee doesn't have faith in herself to believe that Cross would really like her and they could be a couple is more true to life than if the author had given them a happy ending. Sittenfield knows the voice of this character. For all the girls out there who don't believe they fit in, this is your book."
3,"If you liked ""She's Come Undone,"" you'll love this...","Of course, I didn't like ""She's Come Undone."" Both books are about a girl who is disconnected from the world. Sittenfeld's novel was mildly entertaining, but if she'd used the words ""definitive"" or ""definitively"" one more time, I was going to throw the book in the toilet.Interesting narrative, but her jumps between Ault and life-after-Ault were annoying. For example, there was some minor suspense regarding ""spring-cleaning,"" but a review of Lee's yearbook clearly shows that she was not thrown out... so much for that."
1,"High expectations, but disappointed","I had heard good things about this book and it looked to be an interesting novel of teen self-discovery. The main character, however, was rarely redeemable in any situation in the book. Slavish to men, to authority, to the wills and wiles of her peers, Lee Fiora was neither complex nor very interesting. Overthinking every situation was one of her specialities, a characteristic that Ms. Sittenfeld played up so much that it became hard to endure. I think perhaps worst of all, was the fact that Lee seemed to never learn from her mistakes. Every so often, she would discuss how she would later react to a similar situation in the future and oftentimes, it was not that different from her teen self, especially situations involving men. I find this disheartening and not true to the fact that the author seemed to think Lee was actually learning something from her surroundings. It was a lesson in what a dismal, self-fulfilling prophecy life can be if you let it."
1,"Long, painful and incredibly boring","I absolutely hated this book. At no point was I able to work up the slightest empathy for the whining and self involved main character. I actually laughed out loud and cheered ""go dad!"" in the scene where he slaps her for being rude and distant to her family. It took me over a week to plow through the book and I was left with a distinct sense that I had wasted precious reading time. I cannot imagine why it ever made anyone's best seller or best book list!"
1,what is the hype about?,"ok- so where are the great parts of this book? I didn't read any.. I met this author at a book signing.. she seemed to be way too over-excited to talk about ""her"" life. Her voice was high pitched and she sounds like a child trapped in a lesbo body. This story was just dumb."
1,Prep: A bore,"The characters are dull and one-dimensional. The story is bland and as the parent of a child who attends a prep school down the road from the one Ms. Sittenfeld teaches at, I'd say she got the details and the point of view all wrong. There's a lot to be said (both good and bad) about the kids who go to these types of schools (and the parents who send their kids there.) Unfortunately, Ms. Sittenfeld's weak prose doesn't begin to represent pathos of this particular slice of society."
1,A complete waste of time!!,I had high hopes for this book. Seemed like it would be a good story yet the author never fully develops Lee. You never really get a clear understanding of who she was before she went to Ault-that makes it very difficult to understand why she is so emotionally crippled during her time there. I ended up getting so bored with the entire book - your empathy for Lee quickly fades once you realize how lethargic and unmotivated she is. Don't waste your time on this one!
2,Disturbing stereotypes,"I found the main character, Lee, to be boring and much too concerned with what everyone she encountered thought or did. However, what turned me off the most were the archaic stereotypes all through the book. I can't help but think that the author herself is a very prejudiced person and used Lee as her spokesperson.I was offended by the fact that (naturally) it was the inner-city black girl who stole from the dorm rooms. How about the Hispanic girls who (of course) wore too much makeup and loud clothing? Several comments the main character made about Jews also seemed to come out of left field and were completely offensive.You can use the excuse that it was just the ""character"" talking but it really made me dislike her."
3,Slow read...writer is too verbose.,"I read everything from chick lit to true crime to the classics and this one was just too slow and too shallow for me. There is very little depth to this book and I am truly suprised I perservered to the finish. The main character, as another reviewer put it, is annoying and pathetic - and not in an endearing way. It also killed me that the one black girl got expelled in the beginning bc she stole money from all the white girls - come on! cliche and stereotypical.I did enjoy reading about some of her coming of age experiences (which were truly hilarious and quite graphic) but it was not a page turner for me (I am a reader who needs action-packed or intricate stories to stay hooked). This is almost like a Judy Blume book for adults."
3,Undecided...,"I'm undecided as to whether this is actually a good book or not. The observations by the narrator and heroine (or anti-heroine, if you prefer) are spot on - Lee Fiora notes the interactions between students and staff and the rules of discussing money in this upper-middle-class environment where she is one of a handful of scholarship students. On the other hand, her academic progress and her interactions with her family outside of school are only briefly touched upon, and although the boarding school atmosphere is captured and the intensity of adolescence almost tangible on the pages, it feels too much like a memoir, rather than a work of fiction, to be completely comfortable."
3,Nothing special here,I was expecting it to be pretty good given all the comparisons to Catcher in the Rye and the rave reviews. I thought it was so-so. By the middle I didnt really care anymore about the characters. Just unimpressive people in the teenage situations that I no longer find interesting to relive.
1,Don't Bother With This Book,"This book has got to be one of the worst I've ever read. The main character Lee is from a middle class family and is attending a boarding school where all of her peers are wealthy. Lee overthinks EVERYTHING and it gets annoying really fast, she can't do anything for herself and you'll be screaming at the book telling her what to do. She's so self-involved and if the book were funny it would be okay but it seems as if the book is supposed to be serious. I got tricked by an adorable cover and a cute story but the author just didn't bring this story to life for me. For God sakes you don't even know what year it takes place but you know everything about every person attending Lee's school, Ault, their first and last names, what their parents do, how many siblings, these are all people Lee has never even talked to. Boring book and really hard to get through."
4,"Cross, you would be terrible in a war","I had to throw a reference to Finny in there. You can't read about a relentlessly optimistic boarding school sports hero with a leg injury and not think of _A Separate Peace_.A friend of mine read this for a book club, and she was the only one willing to stand up for Cross. Everyone else thought he was a complete jerk. It just goes to show how absorbing the narrator's negative attitude can be. The reader really has to work to see anything from any point of view but hers.Of course, once you do the work, you start to see how worthwhile everyone is. I loved all the characters the second time around."
3,"Good, with a caveat","Prep is very readable and I loved the flow of the story. Lee Fiora is a memorable though sometimes frustrating character. One of the only problems I have with this book is that the sex scenes are too many and too graphic. This takes away from the quality of the story. A classy author can write about such things without dwelling on them so much, and Sittenfeld fails to do this. For this reason many schools may probably not be able to use the book for students to read, which is a shame because the rest of the book is very good."
4,Good and Relateabel,"As a former student at a pseudo-prep school, I was able to relate to Lee Fiora. While my school wasn't a boarding school, it was a NYC private school made up of mostly affluent kids who were headed to Ivy League Schools. Like Lee, I, was a middle class, somewhat mediocre student of non-desctip popularity in that environment. There were so many anecdotes in this book that I found so relateable, that I have to commend the author for being so right on. However, much of it was a bit extreme - particularly Lee's extreme lack of self esteem (despite it all, I did enjoy high school - i can't imagine I would have stuck with an experience as miserable as Lee's).While overall accurate and enjoyable, there were times when it dragged a bit. It also got a little depressing, I could have handled a few positive story lines. But, overall, an enjoyable read."
3,Good high school novel that reminds you why you favored college over high school!,"Great author - he writes so well from a high schooler's point of view that you wonder if perhaps he still is one. Because I can uniquely attest to this girl's adventures and tribulations through my own high school experience, I found myself rooting for this protagonist through her many troubling yet evolving years of high school, filled with too many trust fund babies with too much time. I really wanted her to get as much out if her experience as I did. She seemed to be evolving over the years. In the end, however, she lacked the maturity to overcome the materialism and superficiality that surrounded her. Her actions at the end of the book came as a disappointment. Perhaps I was too optimistic but she seemed to have missed the learning curve..."
4,Very readable,"I enjoyed this book because it takes you deep inside the mind of the main character - a teenager who is in an environment where she doesn't fit it. I don't much care about what teenagers think or about prep school, but somehow I found this book very interesting. I was depressed toward the end of the book and after I read it because I had a similar experience with my first ""boyfriend"" and I also felt very out of place in high school and in some work settings as an adult."
4,"Extremely ""Not Bad""","Prep is self-indulgent to read, the protagonist is self centered, introspective to a point of obsession, and overall obsessed with external validation... But what teenager isn't? The novel will take you back in time to high school, and give other high school students a kick of perspective through (what I hope to be on the author's part) satire. It's a good story that entertains and brings to light the politics of race, gender, and class in a closed in setting."
2,Selfish Brat Boards and Bores,"Lee, the narrator and protagonist of Prep, is one of the most unlikeable main characters that I've encountered. Her tedious self-consciousness gets old by the time she's a sophomore. The endless introspection and judgments of others seem to be way beyond what a teenager would actually think or be able to articulate. The author's adult perspective is too apparent in many of Lee's riffs on her classmates, teachers, parents, etc.The story is absorbing enough; the settings seem authentic. It makes for a decent read, but Lee comes off as a selfish, self-absorbed and ungrateful snob-in-reverse."
5,So true,"This book was so extraordinarily well-written -- it reminds me completely of what high school was like -- of all the complex & sometimes nonsensical thoughts that ran through my head. It makes so many other novels about adolescence seem somewhat one dimensional.In the same way that Dave Eggers' stream-of-consciousness ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" captured the way my mind works now, Curtis Sittenfeld's rather more carefully written novel captured a lot of the way my mind worked then. Only for some reason, I can't seem to capture this essence on paper as well as these two authors can."
2,Like a slush-filled New England Winter,"This novel -- promoted as a ""coming-of-age"" story of a midwestern girl in an east coast boarding school -- could have been fabulous. It's obvious that the author can write, and she has some great insights into human nature of the teenage kind. But the overall storyline was disjointed, the main character wishy-washy and unappealing, and the sex gratuitous. Too much started to go on while nothing of any real substance happened. Lots of observations about the school and students, but the main character, Lee, was somehow unable to turn that same insight to herself. I found her unbelievable, and, frankly, unlikeable. A dull read -- like slogging through a slush-filled New England February."
3,Just So-So,"I'm a fan of the author and have been for a number of years since she first won a fiction contest in Seventeen Magazine, but I was not completely blown away by this book. The writing is well done and the characters keep you semi-interested in what's going on, but it had a bit too stereotypical of a feel for me. Sure, everybody has an impression of what boarding school kids sound and act like, perhaps even from an outsider's point of view, but Lee's negativity about everything did start to get linear after awhile and drag the book down.I liked ""An American Wife"" much better than this."
2,Wished for more,The book is easy to read and flows well but there isn't a lot of substance to keep you interested. The author covers four years of high school but relates little of what the main character actually does in school or how she changes and evolves. More action and more development of the other characters would help pull the reader in more and make a more interesting book.
2,Maybe I didn't know what to expect,"But I wasn't expecting this. Prep was a little too creepy for me - creepy being the only word I can think of. Lee was so unlikeable I almost wished they'd kick her out of school so I could stop reading. But I did finish the book, it just wasn't something I'd want to read again."
3,Over-rated,"I thought that with the NYTimes most notable book accolade that Prep would be worth my time. As a former prep school scholarship student, I was hoping to find a kindred spirit in Lee. Alas, I found myself annoyed over and over with Lee. I don't think I would have hung around her if I'd been at Ault with her. And I think she is the type of kid who wouldn't have been happy anyplace. All that is to say, I had little to no sympathy for the protagonist. Several times I nearly quit reading it all together. I did finish it, but I really felt it hadn't merited my time. It was too heavy for fluff reading and too vapid for serious reading.I did give it three stars because at first it did grab my interest and there were some good depictions of teenage narcissism and emotional blindness."
4,I liked it,"From the point of view of someone who went through boarding school, I can tell you Prep is a good book. It's not all that realistic. But its really good. I wouldn't classify it with a Grapes of Wrath or Great Gatsby or anything like that. It's just a good interesting book like My Fractured Life or Old School."
1,Boreing,"She is over analyzing everything she sees thinks or does, And too much detail makes the story boring. It needs to keep my attention but it doesn't.. It's like reading a teen's diary."
3,"Great writing, but...","Great writing, but the character...ug! I was miserable reading about her miserable time at school. Nothing happened for her because she didn't do anything for herself except wallow in self pity. Again, the book was extremely well written and I hope the author comes out with another book, but hopefully with characters full of life."
4,Great read,I live in the city that the author is from (and have worked with her father in the past) so I was chomping at the bit to read this. I loved it! Curtis has a way of really drawing in her reader and telling a captivating story.
1,Pathetic and Frustrating,I will concede that this book was well written - but that is it. I found this character to be so incredibly frustrating and pathetic. Maybe it was because I could not relate to what she was going through - but is it really true that all those who feel like outsiders are so completely passive about improving their experiences? Lee was SO ANNOYING! I also thought that the book REALLY rambled at times and I found these parts to be rather boring.
1,What book were the others reading?,"This book had the potential to be so so so much more than it was. An Indiana teen-age girl on scholarship at an elite New England prep school. It received wonderful reviews and the write ups I read in magazines had me wanting to read it. And after I finished it, all I could ask was, ""What book were they all reading?""This main character is boring, mindless, and self-involved. She's a brat, to put it mildly. And none of the other characters were developed enough throughout the course of the book to make me give it a better rating. This story line could have been so much better, but because Lee herself is nothing, so was the book."
1,What A Surprise!!!! Don't belive the hype,"I am on chapter two and I have closed the book found my receipt and looked up the return policy...What a surprise the Black girl is the THIEF!!!! Not only does she live in a single she is on scholarship because we all know that there are not any black people that can afford prep school!!! And she steals!!! I an SO getting my money back!!!! The book is poorly written and excuse me for saying so but I think the main character was such a weirdo and she deserved all the sucky treatment that she recieved so take that back to South Bend Indiana and contemplate on that!!!! And I will be on my way to the book store...Oh are you surprised that amongst the praise for this shoddy piece of ""work"" that there are so few real reviews? Don't be fooled ..."
2,I can't beleive how bad this book was.,"I read some reviews on amazon, and yes, I thought this book would be good, but in the end I saw this book as being about a judgemental, shy girl, with absolutley no self confidence or self respect. I expected in a way I might be able to relate to this girls situation. I am an outsider at a jewish prep day school, and in no way am I able to identify myself into the groups of society. I didn't enjoy reading about this girls angst, when she was the one who needed to step up herself."
3,"Entertaining, but not much more.","I enjoyed reading this book on the beach last summer while relaxing during a short vacation. It is an interesting take on a somewhat unoriginal story. I wouldn't give it a so-so. Not too bad, not too good. Maybe worth a try."
3,Jury's still out...,"Although I have not finished the book yet (though I'm nearly there...), I have to point out the obvious datedness of this book. It sounds like it was written whan I was in high school (15 years ago). No cell phones, laptops, ipods, etc. She even somehow manages to go to the movies, buy earrings, and lunch at the beginning of the book with less than $20. Although that makes it a little quaint and charming, a book published in 2006 should be either more obviously a ""period piece"" or updated to include things that are staples in today's society. It was very distracting for the first half of the book until I just let it go."
5,What a delight!,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this novel! This author is a true talent. I highly recommend it.
2,suckage,"ok so.....when i first started reading this book, i couldnt put it down. but i soon tired of lee and all her insecurities. also, the last chapter was rather explicit and i felt totally unprepared for it. there was no indication anywhere that that was coming up, and i found all the details rather disturbing. the author could have simply said ""we fooled around"" or ""we slept together"" but she went into great detail describing sex acts. it wasnt a very good book overall and i think i should have chosen something else."
5,WONDERFUL AND HELPFUL,"This is a wonderful book full of important tips for the management of the Alzheimers patient. The most valuable elements for our family is the instructions for moving and caring for a bed ridden family member.The book is not new, but then again the methods for lifting and moving a patient have not changed. Further the advice on dealing with the stages of the disease are still timely and current.This is an excellent, caring, well written book at a very inexpensive price. I fully recommend this book."
1,Don't bother,My partner and I bought 100 copies of this book to give to referring dentists. I never got a single thank you.
4,More fun than a miniature Godzilla!,"If you've never ""read"" a Gon book, get thee to a bookstore. I use the word ""read"" in quotation marks because the only words in Gon books are the titles. Gon is a delightful meticulously-rendered itty-bitty dinosaur with a bad attitude. Sometimes, underneath his scaled tough exterior, he's a big softy. My favourite tale in Gon on Safari is ""Gon and the Bird Nest on His Head"". While on a typical rampage, he knocks a bird nest out of a tree, and somehow ends up with it as a bizarre hat. The three baby birds who live in it are terrified, at first. After a while, they become accustomed to their new ""tree,"" and begin to notice some fringe benefits.The story may sound trite and simplistic, but seeing the art will change your mind. Masashi Tanaka is a master cartoonist. Each of his drawings must take hours, and sometimes even days to complete. He pays careful attention to even the most miniscule detail, and the end result is pure joy."
5,Calvin Keys is an Excellent Jazz Guitarist,"Calving Keys is a really good player. I really like the songs on this album too. There's a lot of variety and his playing is awesome. I really like the mood on the song Touch and also on Too Late Now, which was one of the songs in the Fred Astaire movie Royal Wedding. You Are All I Need is really good too."
5,A MUST HAVE for any Natalie Merchant fan,"Natalie has always had a spectacular voice, but it has gotten even better over the years. She has amazing talent. She writes many of her songs, and plays the piano. She has a wonderful personality and she's really funny. You will be mezmerized by her voice. I highly recommend this DVD (it also comes in video)and I also recommend really anything by Natalie. You will not be dissapointed. But, her live performances are extra special."
2,Disappointing,"I was a a very big fan of 10,000 Maniacs when Natalie was the lead singer and because of that I purchased Natalie's debut solo lp. It was very good. ""Ophelia"" IMO was not as good. Too many slow and dreary songs. I found many of the songs on the DVD boring and it wasn't helped by the sub-par audio recording. I never liked the song ""Ophelia"" and found it to be a poor choice for the opening song. Her version of ""Wonder"" was, you guessed it, boring. There were definitely better songs she could have included, live, such as ""Life is Sweet"" instead of a partial recording of it. Also, what about the single ""Kind and Generous"". The CD of the concert with different song selections was much better and not boring. I probably am more of a fan of 10,000 Maniacs than Natalie's solo CD's. The so-called documentary (if you can call it that) was mis-leading as it was less than 5 minutes and not really a documentary."
3,Solid Natalie,"Natalie plays several of her hits and also throws in some covers as well. Her voice is solid on this CD, but the live performace of her band (especially the guitarist) is less than thrilling. Overall, a solid buy for Natalie fans, but not ""fresh"" enough to get a higher rating."
2,Stick with the Maniacs,"I'm a big Natalie fan, but not a fanatic. The DVD didn't do much for me. i bought it after listening to the Live CD, but was disappointed that the playlist didn't include anything more of substance. The documentry consisted of all of 5 minutes of people in line for the show. Life is sweet was audio only, Waterbound, Senor don gato were awful, and anyone who was a 10000 manics fan would not enjoy her drawn out these are days.Stick with the **** MTV Unplugged - 10k maniacs video...a far better value.The whole setlist:List is sweet(partial), Opheilia, wonder, san andres fault, beloved wife, senor don gato, space oddity, carnival, break your heart, these are days, gulf of araby, waterbound."
4,Two complaints,1) The concert clocks in at only 60 minutes. Why were so many songs cut? This is a DVD! Give us at least 90 minutes worth of material.2) It claims to also contain a documentary. It doesn't. It has a few minutes of clips of fans. That isn't a documentary.Other than the above it is great. It should be like a $9.99 DVD given its insufficiant usage of the space provided.
1,"avoid the live DVD, buy the studio recordings","I was very disappointed in this DVD, so much so that I returned it. The audio quality is poor, with enough audible distortion that I found it unlistenable, and I am not an audiophile, just a mainstream consumer. The video quality is marginal, about on par with a second-generation VHS copy. The direction is poor, with many shots of the back of musicians' heads. The extras, interviews, etc. are either brief or non-existent. Compare this DVD with Diana Krall: Live in Paris in terms of audio/video quality, direction, extras, etc., and they are as night and day. I recommend avoiding this DVD and enjoying Natalie's studio recordings."
5,Energetic and suprisingly playful,"Natalie is a happy, joyful person beaming with life and energy as she entertains her crowd. The painful and annoying slow motions shots of her dancing and spinning can be easily overlooked by these truely awesome performances, a brilliant and beautiful performer with and amazing voice. A great show! I can't wait to actually see her live now."
2,Horrible,"Natalie could have been a little more nicer to the audience instead of being a prude like she always was. You hardly could hear her voice, she looks like a farmer girl in These are days and really she doesn't show a sense of appreciation to anyone. Her band is too loud....Not a great video, especially to a die-hard Merchant fan."
5,A nice tool to have,"This zester creates strips of zest that are perfect for the decorative flourish on salads, fruits, desserts, pastas, etc. I also like the thick zest created by this zester in my pasta. The other reviewer is right though that if you needed finely grated zest this isn't the right tool. The microplane grater is perfect for very fine zest such as what you would need in key lime pie."
4,Great Movie>>>No Xtra Features!,One of the greatest romantic comedies ever! DVD looks good...just no xtra features whatsoever..
2,Sorry to Disagree,"I see everyone else gave the movie 5 stars. I hate to be the fly in their ointment, but I didn't care for this movie. I saw it at the show when it first came out way back when. The love story wasn't believable to me. I never could believe Richard Dreyfuss would be attracted to Marsha Mason, or vice versa. I just didn't feel any chemistry between the two. I like Dreyfuss in other roles, but not this one. Even the kid got on my nerves. Sorry to rain on the parade."
4,Good movie.,I love this movie. I saw it 20 years ago in the theater and just now bought it. This is Richard Dreyfuss' followup moving to Jaws. It is a romantic love story. Enjoy!
2,"Wow, this movie was lame","I watched it just to see what all the fuss was about. It was on Turner Classic Movies channel, so thankfully I didn't waste any money buying a DVD. This movie was lame. Neil Simon's style of writing gets on my nerves very quickly. There is a lot of fast-paced dialogue and often bickering going on in his stories. These characters were not likeable. In fact, they were both pretty rude people. This business of Richard Dreyfuss coming home one day after he had gotten the black eye, suddenly being madly in love with Marsha Mason was totally unbelievable crap. Anyway, I was mildly entertained because it was so lame, that I gave it two stars instead of one. The kid was also pretty annoying. These stories that make these kids act very adult like and witty are very annoying."
2,"Ok, but not worth the time","Another romantic comedy about two unlikable people. Marsha Mason's character is constantly cranky and critical. Dreyfus plays an off-Broadway actor who is somewhat likable but overbearing and difficult to get along with. Both take stances in their relationship that no sane person would, making it difficult to relate to these two. Dreyfus is also saddled with, and we are condemned to watch, a few horrible scenes of an abysmal version of Richard the Third. An hour into the film, Mason softened a bit, but by then it was too late for me."
2,Goodbye to the Goodbye Gril,The movie is okay.The Video that was provided had some real audio problems. The sound was not very good. The words and the actors mouth were no sychned up.
1,Stopped watching two bitter people after 30 minutes,"There are many older ""romantic"" comedies that follow this plot: two self-absorbed, abrasive people exchange witty, hurtful repartee. This is often very fast paced and in that sense quite unnatural, these stars always have the perfect insult on the tip of their tongue. That, I think, is supposedly the comedy part. Then these two people fall in love. That is supposedly the romantic part. Such movies never strike me as funny, romantic or interesting for that matter, because I don't care about the characters. I stopped watching after 30 minutes."
2,Not as good the second time around,I wanted to watch this movie because I remember liking it at the movies when it first came out. I couldn't get into it this time. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the two actors and I ended up falling asleep before it was over. The movie seemed quite dated to me.
1,"I watched this in 1977 and thought it was a terrific movie, now...","after having been a foster mother to a young girl who was raped (twice) by her mother's live-in boyfriend, I wonder why we exalt a movie so completely devoid of values. What was this mother thinking as she selected ruinous relationships that will affect her daughter's life forever?"
1,I beg to differ....,"This is my least favorite film of all time. Richard Dreyfuss jogging in place in the kitchen while eating yogurt tops the list for images of contrived, neurotic, insipid, self-indulgent pseudo-eccentricity. There was little or no credible chemistry between the main characters, nor were they at all interesting individually. This film made ""Love Story"" seem like high art by comparison."
5,The best movie I have ever seen,I wish Amazon gave a one in a lifetime 6 stars rating opportunity. I would give it to this movie. My one-in-a-lifetime choice. I have seen it at least 9 times in the last 6 years or so.
5,A little hookey but a fun movie,"The film was a bit dated, but the acting was very good. The plot a bit simple but I loved that it had a happy ending and for once the guy in the story didn't turn out to be a heel. It offered hope."
3,It is just an overview,"I liked this book as an overview of Senator Joseph McCarthy. However, the author is a bit biased and he does not provide any sources for his information. In addition, I expected the author to elaborate more on the famous trials conducted under McCarthy's orders, but I didn't find any."
2,Check the Facts,Richard Rovere should consider himself a comedian. The book has so many flaws about Senator McCarthy that I can't believe Mr. Rovere can be classified as a legitimate historian.Declassified Soviet documents are proving that Senator Joe McCarthy was right. Biased historians like Rovere should be academically scorned for thier years of lies and distortions.
3,Enjoyable mystery,"Being a former Mainer (albeit a Northerner, and not a downeaster), I'm always hesitant to read books with a Maine setting. Too few authors get it right. This author does get it right. The main characters (Jake, Ellie, Sam, Wayne, and George) are fun to get to know.What keeps this from being a four or five star book is the thorough unlikeableness of the victim and the suspects, apart from the sleuth's best friend, Ellie. The more I got to know about them, the less I liked any of them. There wasn't enough contrast between the suspects -- basically I wouldn't have minded if any of them had done it. In many mysteries of this genre, there's a suspect that you just don't want to be the killer. This book lacked that aspect, and it bothered me. I wanted some shades of gray that just weren't there."
3,"amusing read, but not that realistic","First, let me say that I live in downeast Maine where this story takes place. Sarah Graves' book is on the whole, an interesting read. She keeps the plot flowing at a good pace, and keeps the reader guessing untill the very end(unfortunately, the final solution didn't hold together too well for me.) Her details on Eastport itself are for the most part acurate, with only a bit of artistic licence taken. The biggest problem I found in the book, is that most of her main characters-financial gods, former Mafia people-have never lived, nor can I picture them ever living in Eastport. This is of corse something that no one would know unless they lived here, but it made the book very unrealistic for me(But I guess that's why they call it fiction). But for mystery lovers who arn't familiar with downeast Maine, ""The Dead Cat Bounce"" is a book well worth picking up, and, in spite of my criticisims, I look forward to reading Ms. Graves next Eastport novel(due in May '99)"
2,"Disappointing, especially after hearing NPR interview","An interview with author Sarah Graves on National Public Radio prompted me to read this book. I am a murder mystery fan, and I love Maine and old houses so I figured this book couldn't miss for some light summer reading. I was wrong. The plot is improbable and the pace is slow; the books lumbers along. Characters are undeveloped, and, as another reviewer said, not particularly likeable--even the main character. Other books in the series may be better, but I am not likely to pick up another of them after reading this one."
4,Great Maine Mystery,"I felt like I got to know the people in Eastport, Maine. I loved the descriptions of the repair projects along with the description of the town and scenery. Jake is a likeable character and I felt I was solving the murder right along with her. I felt sorry for her son who went back and forth with his father about his future career. The beginning of the book was a little slow and at times the author took too long to describe the scene. The mystery had nice twists and turns and a few red herrings. I can see why this series is so successful. I enjoyed the romance, character, suspense and even the storms. I look forward to reading all of the books in this series."
4,Second review of this suthor's books,"Having found that this book was the first in the series, after having read about 3 others, I enjoyed it just as much. It was fun to get back in time from the others, and see what was different while knowing some of the changes to come with the characters. At least I now have the order of the books, so can continue on as they were written."
4,Good Scholarly Book.,"This book was required reading for a course I took on the politics of the Persian Gulf. It is a collection of essays from prominent experts in the field. I give it four stars only because it is a bit outdated. That said, even though it is nearly ten years old, most of it is still relevent today. One can look in academic journals or area briefs to supplement the information provided in the book and get a more up to date prospective of the arguements presented. There is also a website that relates to the text given. Most of the arguments are sound and thought provoking even though conditions in the gulf today are much different than in 1997."
5,Wonderfully clean treats,"I'm very picky, so I was thrilled to find a really simple, healthy treat with no junk added. She loves them and they can be broken easily into smaller sizes perfect for training."
4,Good Band,I've been a fan of Praying Mantis for years. I never heard of this till I bought it on Amazon. It's a good album although I was disappointed that the dude from Iron Maiden sang (ruined)a couple of songs I liked Mantis singing. Still it's worth a listen. Try Time Tells No Lies if you really want to hear what this band is capable of.
2,Purchased this video from Amazon.,I was disappointed with this product. I selected it after seeing the Nina Berry interviewed on our local TV Program on Aging. There was nothing in the exercise that would work up a good belly laugh.The Comedians on National TV do a far better job with well timed jokes. Ms Berry probably does well with a live audience.
1,Did not meet expectations.,Thought this video would be hilarious and that you would be laughing most of the time. It was not and I did not.
5,Get rough,"Very good construction.It fits my PDA firmly and still ok to use the touchscreen. It is bulky, as you know it, but does the job pretty well. It has fallen a few times and my PDA suffered nothing. I like and recommend it."
4,Just a Dab,"I know you're not supposed to put silicone in your hair. But I just use a tiny bit of this stuff. Less than a dime. Pea-size amount rubbed in palms then spread on ends. It makes my dry, fly-away hair - shiny and smooth."
3,Maybe they didn't work for me,"I was using a similar kind in the hospital so bought these as soon as I got home, but I had more skin irritation from using them. I liked the cool, numbing feeling when you first use them."
3,I don't understand racism,"well, yes i's true maybe the movie is not that great; but the theme is interesting.i'm puertorican. it's very hard for me to deal with racism, not because i'm a victim, just because i believe it's not right. just in case, they call me white which i'm not. we are all mixed, having of course genetical attributes expressed, but in the end we are mixed, which it's beatiful. and it doesn't make a difference in the respect we deserve.James Woods was running for the Oscars. i don't know who won over him. his performance along it's worth the movie. i hate him to death, him and his arrogance."
1,No Justice For White Guilt,"Aside from a deftly constructed performance by James Woods, there's not much to this paint-by-numbers courtroom caper. Only in a Clintonesque landscape would a film be made about a (white) lawyer attending a (black man's) funeral and suddenly feeling that person's pain! Egads! There really is no justice for White Liberalism! For a better take on the real thing, check out _Mississippi Burning_; this flick is simply manipulative, curiously sentimental and ultimately shameless."
2,Cheap plastic container,"This container is so, so cheap that not even a dollar store i would buy it. The plastic wrap doesn't stick... it is too cheap for my taste."
2,Warning! Saran Wrap won't stick,"everything else the reviewers say about this bowl is true. It's great.But if you're using it for bread dough or just about anything you intend to store, forget it. The Saran Wrap/Glad Wrap, etc. won't stick to the sides. Must be some bizarre chemical reaction."
5,Very Nice Mixing bowl - my primary one now!,"I love this mixing bowl...I was hesitant to buy it on Amazon because seeing it in person usually is better for these types of items, but I was pleasantly surprised. Previously, I had a LARGE stainless steel bowl and it was too big to store in the kitchen without trouble, and you had to wash it immediately after use or it was a nightmare to clean. This new OXO bowl is a perfect size for cake batter, or cookies, or what-have-you. I love the nonskid bottom, it helps a lot when mixing a tough batter. It has a lip to pour out of, whereas my previous one did not. It's extremely easy to clean too! And for $9.95 it's quality and will be used time and time again. I'd buy another one in a second if I needed it again.Highly suggested!"
4,"lightweight, sturdy, good value","couple of gripes:1. a metal whisk scratches the plastic (I use a metal whisk for every baking task except measuring, separating eggs and kneading).2. relatively shallow, so more to clean up afterward. also, if I put my arm around the bowl, the ingredients spill.good points:it's big. it's a good value (for the size). it's relatively lightweight, but sturdy. rubberized bits are helpful.conclusion:I'll use it for tossing/sifting ingredients, or holding larger quantities. won't use it for actual batter/dough making."
2,So disappointed with this bowl!,"Generally speaking, I think OXO is a fabulous brand and I own lots of tools from them. It isn't that this is a bad bowl, just that it is not as good as it could be (try Rubbermaid instead). It's too shallow for most baking that requires using a mixer first (it splatters everywhere), and the handle is so inconvenient when you try to pick it up to pour out the contents. They missed the mark on ergonomic design here."
3,Too large,"The product looks good, but it's too large... much larger than I expected from the website display. Just returned it. If you're looking for a bowl to serve more than 4 people, this is the right product. Otherwise I don't recommend it."
2,Nice Bowl....but don't use Metal Beaters,Metal Beaters and whisks do indeed scratch this bowl! I made mashed potatoes in this bowl and it performed wonderfully until I emptied the bowl and saw all the scratches...I was very dissappointed!
3,Basic mixing bowl,"I've owned one of these for probably the last 3-5 years or so. It still works fine, and there's nothing particularly bad about it except maybe that it's ugly. The plastic is easy to scratch as you would expect from plastic, the inside of mine is pretty scratched up. The rubber parts in this design are fine, but I haven't particularly felt like they enhance the mixing bowl experience. The size is larger than you might expect just looking at the picture. I think if I had it to buy over, I'd get a metal one like theAmco 3-Quart Stainless Steel Mixing bowl."
5,Great Mixing Bowl,"Light weight, but sturdy. I have the whole set, and bought this one for my mother who always comments on how much she likes the bowls when she uses them at my house. The set is a better deal but she already had one, and had requested the smaller one. Cleans up nicely."
5,5 quart for making cookie/cake/brownie dough.,"I don't have space for a stand mixer but I like lots of room for my dough to be created. I don't like a mess and even though the 5 quart is a tad too big and perhaps hard to wash afterwards since it takes the entire sink, it is very useful, sturdy and keeps dough inside. When I pull this bowl out, I feel happy because I know I am going to bake. :) You know OXO, the black rubber is like a car tire and will keep steady and the white plastic super strong. I wish they had this in pink but frankly, as boring as it looks, this will never die on me and is the best for making dough. Cleans so nicely with just water but of course, detergent must be use. Dries up in minutes too! :) If I had money, I would buy all sizes. Worth every penny and makes great wedding gifts guys! :D"
4,luv the gripper,Nice large mixing bowl and it really grips the counter. I prefer stainless steel but haven't found one with the gripper bottom yet.
4,5-quart mixing bowl,"Since this was sold as a set I had no choice in the size, but it is really, really large. I would have preferred a 4-quart size."
5,stay bowl stay,"the rubber bottom on this bowl really helps the bowl stay put when mixing... especially for chocholate chip cookie dough which can get pretty tough to mix. Great for whipping eggs too, nestles quite well with the 2 quart model."
4,Not as shown in picture,"We have the whole set of Oxo grips bowls and have thoroughly enjoyed using them. This one with the pour spout is great and after years of overuse, the pour spout broke. We ordered this one as a replacement because it is hard to find one like we broke, with the small grip handle. The image for this bowl shows the small grip handle, but really it is the long side handle like others you will see on the website. Other than that...it is another oxo grip bowl like we love!"
4,Great screenplay from a great writer,"I liked Jackie Brown so much that I read the screenplay and Rum Punch. The story was just a brilliant caper. However, I have this to say to Quentin Tarrantino: why all the ""N"" words?"
4,NIP's comin back in the new millenium,"Ganxsta NIP is back with ""The Return of The Psychopath"" his first release since 1998. There is something for all NIP fans on this new offering as NIP blends his Psycho Thug style with the Psychopath of old...There are a few songs from his earlier work ""Psycho Thug"" included and the rest are all new NIP for the new millenium. If your a Ganxsta NIP fan this is a must have. Although I prefer his forst 2 cd's to any other, this is another solid effort by the King of Horrorcore rap!"
5,Perfect Kitchen Tool...,"I purchased this kitchen utensil as a scoop for my deep fryer. It works perfectly, is very sturdy and has a nice long handle."
4,Quality is good but it does not fit the intended hitch,The idea of the Bedsaver is useful if you have ever dropped trailer on your truck you can appreciate this will prevent costly repairs to both vehicles and down time to repair. However in my case I bought the Bedsaver to fit on a Husky 16K hitch and the bolt patterns on the Bedsaver do not match holes on the hitch and it could not be installed. The advertising is written to imply that the hitch will fit a Husky 16K or 16K slider and that may be the problem. There needs to be a clearer understanding of just what the Bedsaver will match. It also adds about 35 lbs to the weight of the hitch so add in to your GRWW. Amazon has not reimbursed me for shipping which was $38 so I have paid a heavy penalty for a non conforming item. .
5,Big Acres Transforms Healthy into Delicious!,"Big Acres barbeque sauce is my family's favorite. I love Rich & Mild; my husband craves Hot & Spicy; our son devours Teriyaki. Friday night is barbeque night, usually chicken or fish, but always BIG ACRES. Try Big Acres fish tacos; they're are mouth-watering! Big Acres sauces make a healthy meal into a delicious meal! YUM!"
5,The Complete Book of Foaling,"This is book is a complete guide for the foaling attendant. It gives handy supply lists, ideas for predicting the foaling date, and wonderful nutritional advice. There is a lot of good info on warning signs of ""things going wrong"" and how and when to help the mare out. Great book! It's the second copy I've owned."
1,THESE STINK!,"Made out of REALLY cheap plastic, one pair was broken when I received them. Not only that, but they were too small for my face! Don't buy these sunglasses! They're TERRIBLE."
2,Spend a bit more elsewhere.,"I got these because they were fashionable. That was two years ago. I only had these for about 3 months. I never wore them daily. I would wear them while biking, and I took them to camp with me. Then after I picked them up, the screw holding the arms to the lenses was coming out. I ignored it, and soon enough, there went the arm, and the glasses fell off my face and cracked the other arm. So I taped the arm back on, and taped the other arm on the crack to prevent it from falling apart. But, It did.***Bottom line: Don't try it. I've had many, many cheap sunglasses over the years, and its always the same problem. The arm hinge ans screw. If only it could be reinforced by metal or something. (not wire frame glasses, which BTW, Last a bit longer.)"
1,wtf,very very cheap looking they look like they were used by someone and tht someone tried to fix it but did not do a good job do not buy trust me i read all the review and decided to tk a chance with it but i wish i did not they are just good to throw away or give it to a 4 year old
1,Very Cheap Sunglasses,"For $2.90, I expected these to be cheap sunglasses. But when I received them, I noticed that they were nothing more than novelty sunglasses from Oriental Trading. Don't waist your time or money on these sunglasses from here. If you really want them, go directly to Orientaltrading.com and you can get a dozen pairs for $10."
2,wrong for round face,I guess you get what you pay for. I have several off brand sunglasses but none of them feel so cheap.
5,great services,got them before the days that was given by Amazon. great glasses i wear them all the time and i am going to buy more.
2,Break Quick,"The company is find - shipping was fast and everything went smoothly, no complaints with them. The glasses, however, broke apart after a couple days of normal usage. Just save up and buy the real things for 20x the price :)"
3,Purple lens,"I received purple, as advertised at black lenses.You get what you pay for.The glasses are actually not that bad for the price if you like purple lens."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"These may look like Wayfarers at a distance but anyone will be able to spot them as fakes. They feel very cheap. The plastic is soft, like a toy, not hard and slick like you expect sunglasses to feel. They're great if you're looking for a cheap 'Risky Business' Halloween costume, but they're not sturdy enough for everyday wear."
2,A fan of the product but not the price,"Like others here, I acquired a taste to these things when I was a child. I can understand that they make some people uncomfortable; they look like slimy worms from a deep dark cave. And their taste is nothing like a real hot dog. They are sort of in a class by themselves like a Dorito. You eat it knowing that it has to be one of the most highly manufactured foods in existence but, putting these considerations aside, I heat them up on toast and with a little cheese they are quite good. If I had a can here now I'd eat it.But I don't have a can here. Why not? Simple: $75 (and climbing) for a box of 20 cans. Hey Loma Linda, I know that you had to torture a lot of wheat to make them contort into slimy worms but there really should be a golden ticket in one of those cans at that price point. On second thought maybe I don't want to tour your deep dark caves."
5,Love These Veggie Hot Dogs!,"I was raised on these, and now my kids love them! We usually just heat them in the microwave. They are good with soup, spaghetti-o's, dinner, lunch, etc. I like them cold, sliced on a salad or in a sandwitch with lettuce, tomato, etc. There is no meat in these, so you don't need to cook them. They can also be used in most ways hot dogs can, except I don't think these taste that good boiled. You can grill them, cut them into baked beans, roll them in Pillsbury Crescent rolls and bake, etc. They are very versatile and a good source of protein that my kids will eat!"
1,Yuugh!!,"These are the worst tasting Vegan Hot Dogs i ever tasted!! The Big Franks are good But these taste Awful!!! I have to throw them out! They are that bad! They taste like Metal They fall apart, And the Liquid they come in is really nasty! This should not be Sold!"
5,The ONLY Veggie Dog Choice,There is no alternative...these are THE BEST! I'm so glad I found these at a discount. I have been eating these for 30 years...they are amazing. You can eat them cold right out of the can for a quick delicious treat too ;)
1,Why not provide sizing chart?,"I ordered this product from a third-party partner. While the tank was of excellent quality, there is a distinct sizing issue with the product. I received a medium, but the cut of the tank is either a large or extra large. When I put it on, I am literally swimming in it (yes, I am a medium with a 31 waist and 44 chest). Since there is no sizing information on Amazon or at Athletica's site, it is impossible to guess how these items will actually fit once received. I elected to keep it and just wear it around the house rather than at the gym, but I am very disappointed and won't be ordering from anything from Athletica again."
1,never buy it!!!!,"I can not believe two things:first, the item is too large! I buy a medium one, but it came like LX!second,when I return it back with $5 shipping, it came back again with a label said that I am late for returning! It came to my house in march 17, and it return at the company at Apr 12. It out of return time??I had better read the all the review first, I can not believe this kind of company exit so long!never buy anything from them!"
1,Tank top,Sizing is very small. Worn once...washed...too small to wear again. Flimzy and not well made. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
3,great tanks,"somehow my order got split in 2 so recieved 3 white tanks in large ,,ord 1 lg 1 exl rec 2 exl in red , ord 1 lrg , 1 ext large"
1,Sizing Issue,"The shirt is made very well, high quality, HOWEVER the sizing is all wrong. I ordered an Xtra large and a Large......both seemed to be a child sized....needless to say, my husband couldnt fit them Dont waste your money on these shirts. The merchant was a fast shipper, I had no problems with the transaction at all, however instead of dealing with the hassle of returning them, I just gave them to goodwill."
5,"It's ok to like Bracket,... (not a cliche for a start)","I like this cd it's great from start to finish with the quietist audience ever you must hear little shouting throughout the whole album which is a refreshing change from noise riots in the audience etc..... which is still always good, keep the quality pop-punk churning out bracket and oh dont buy this cd if you take music far too seriously and are to conceited for your own good-not a good idea. I just felt i had to give this 5 stars and oh yeah i bought it by mistake (mixup in the mail order or something) you cant trust overseas mailing these days not like in 1998 when everythi....."
2,Not Even Edible,"Pretzels have been improperly stored and/or prepared with poor-quality ingredients, they have an off taste like rancid vegetable oil. I gave two stars instead of one because Amazon did try twice and refunded both times. Interestingly, I have bought this product before when it was available in the Seattle area and it was excellent. There is obviously a quality-control problem going on somewhere along the line."
3,Sub-Standard Issue,"They had enough material to make three DVDs. Unfortunately, they decided to make six. There are times when a problem is started on one DVD and then actually solved on the next. In fact, the entire problem solving sequence is repeated on the next disc. The Standard Deviants are wonderful. The person who edited the DVDs is out to make money. Here's a suggestion: re-issue the disks. One on linear ODEs, one on 2nd-order ODEs and one on higher order ODEs. I'd like half my money back, please."
1,THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE,"this has to be arguably one of the stupidest f'n movies i've ever seen in my life. maybe 20 yrs ago, it would have been somewhat creative/original but not now. don't waste your money or time on this piece of Sh't movie. the action, story, comedy ALL SUCK... AND i'm KOREAN!!! i support my people's films but this movie is absolutely atrocious. anyone who wrote a favorable review on this film is either working for their distribution company or an f'n moron"
2,Keystone Cops minus the humor,"Boy, are these cops stupid. Think: if the Keystone Cops weren't comedy. That's what these characters are like. They run roughshod over everyone not cuz they are concerned and trying to protect innocent people -- but cuz they don't know what they're doing!The bad guy here seems more intelligent -- but thats just cuz he's calm and confident -- not cuz he does clever things.The direction of his movie may be unexpected and stylish but, for me, it was ugly to look at and it didn't make up for the unethical blundering of the subhuman heroes of this movie."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it!","I saw this movie and thought everything was so absurd. How could rain pour like cats and dogs and have sunlight in the background? (Last fight scene at the abadoned railway) This movie is about a killer drug lord trying to get away from the cops. The plot was dumb, the cinematography was less than average; however, the only nice thing I can say about this movie is it's soundtrack. Pretty good stuff.Give it a rent and see how you like it. Don't blame me that I didn't warn you."
3,"Nicely portable, not great for very small toddlers","I purchased this for when we traveled with my 15 month old, and now at 17 months, it still doesn't work quite right for her. She loves to sit in the chair, but there is so little support, that she ends up slouching down and can't reach food on the table in front of her. When she is a bit older, I think it will work great, but she's not there yet. On the plus side, this folds up very well and fits great in suitcases."
3,Pretty good for occasional use,"The best thing about this booster chair is that it is compact, folds up easily & is relatively light. We were able to travel with it by packing it in our suitcase. Initially we were concerned that the straps may not be sturdy enough to remain firm on the chair that it's strapped to, especially with our 10 month old son squirming in it. But the straps are sturdy and keep the booster chair secure on the regular chair.The only down side is that, because of it's soft fabric, my son sometimes ends up slouching in the booster chair.Overall, this chair works well for travelling or occasional use and is priced reasonably at under $20."
2,Two versions came - one good - one bad,We ordered two of these child seats and two arrived with the same model number but the seats - especially the securing straps were not the same on the two received. One had straps that were integrated with the tubular frame and allowed us to secure the to the adult chair. The other one had loose straps that we had to make fit (by imitating the other one). We think one of the chairs is a stable child's platform and the other is not.
3,Not what I was expecting,"The quality is ok. It is a difficult chair to fold and unfold, specially if you have a toddler dandling on the other arm. Plus it doesn't really adjust to all sizes of chairs and could be better in term of stability. Still good enough to have around."
2,Not tall enough,This was too short for my 2 year old. There was no way he could reach the table in this thing. I wish I could return it but we've already used it because we were visiting family and didnt' have an alternative.
4,son loves it,"Got this for my son for his first birthday and he/we take the poor thing everywhere. My son LOVES it because its his size and he can pick it up and move it himself. His sippy doesn't fit in the side pocket though, but that doesn't bother him or me."
5,Love the Regalo My Chair,"I first saw this chair when we had weekend visitors and they brought this chair a long for their two-year old. I was so impressed, I purchased one for use when my grandchildren come to visit or we take them traveling. It is easy to setup. If cleaning is needed, it is easy to clean."
2,"Cute Chair, but doesn't hold up","I bought this chair when my husband was working out of state as a consultant. I wanted a portable chair that my son could use in the hotel room to eat, watch TV, or drink his sippy cup. This chair was the perfect height, design, and was compact enough to fit in my suitcase without being too bulky. The problem is that it broke on the trip back from our first trip. The fault is in a joint. I bought a second chair and on the next trip kept it the box when I packed. But then my son stood on the chair and the same joint broke in two. That joint is really weak. Too bad! It's such an adorable product."
2,"Great concept, poor quality","We bought 2 of these for our twin girls so they can eat with us at the dining table.The fabric the baby is sitting on is extremely thin. It's also so lose that the babies are sitting only about 1 inch above the dining chair, and they can not reach the table. (They are not heavy kids, they weight about 20 pounds)The seat has a seat cover secured by a Velcro, which is a wonderful idea. The only problem is that this Velcro is stronger than the sewing or the fabric itself. When I tried to remove the cover from the chair it tore the fabric and the sewing.I would not recommend this product to my friends..."
2,cute but does not last long,"I bought this produce for the same reasons many other costumers provided here. It is cute, portable and easy to clean. And it is all that, but I have had it for only 2-3 months and is already broken. One of the buckles broke early on during transport or use, not sure. And then the cloth material started stretching until the baby's butt was resting in the chair (the base chair, or the floor if the chair was put in the floor). No more booster chair any more. I had to put a few fillers underneath so it still works as a booster, but now is not portable any more."
4,Baby Feeding Chairs,These chairs were purchased to provide feeding chairs for twins that were coming to visit. They were transported between houses several times during the holidays. They were easy to setup and take down. The carrying case makes it easy to transport. They provided safety for the children during their visit. We are well pleased with the product.
3,Good,"This cd of the videos of brandy is good, due that i am not familiar with her songs i give her 3 stars. Recommended to people who love Brandy, they will love this cd."
5,Great Buy,"This DVD is an excellent choice for any Brandy or music fan. It has all of her best videos in their full length, which have great sound and digital quality. It also has some partial interviews inbetween some of the videos to give Brandy's personal insight on a particular song. I was very impressed with the quality of this DVD and song choice for this compilation. I would recommend it to anyone who loves Brandy or R&B."
5,These videos are so great!,"i really love Brandy the videos because you can watch brandy anytime you want to! what I liked best about the videos is that between the videos there is a part where brandy talks about her relationship with monica, her album never say never etc. What I didn't like about the videos is that the video ""missing you"" wasn't included. I think this is a really good gift for Brandyfans, but i think that not brandy fans will like it allso!"
5,Taino Bible,"This book was an incredible read. The pictures are absolutely riveting. As a Dominican, I am proud of my culture and reading this book will do the same from you. I refer to this book so often just to look at the beautiful images, I guarantee that you will do the same."
1,Mechanical failure,"I normally love OXO products. Amongst other things, I own an OXO can opener, a few OXO knives, an OXO ladle, a plastic OXO spoon.The lever on this ice cream scoop broke after only two months (on its third use). We sent it back to the company several months ago, but have not heard any response.Also, it's a particularly lightweight scoop, so if your ice cream is as frozen as that from the average New York Deli, you'd be better off finding a heavier one."
2,Difficult to clean,"This ice cream scoop was okay at getting the ice cream out with the lever, but like other reviews said, it was hit and miss. The worst part about this scoop was that it wouldn't come clean in our dishwasher. The lever would trap food and other debris on the bottom lip of the scoop (on the edge of the hole at the bottom of the scoop). We tried rinsing the scoop well before putting it in the dishwasher but that wasn't successful either. The only solution we were able to come up with was wrapping a rubber band around the level to hold it open while being washed. Definitely didn't want to do that every time we had ice cream so we are buying a new one."
5,Excellent scoop,"I have owned or used many different ice cream scoops over the years, and this is, without a doubt, the best scoop of its size class available. It can take a lot of punishment (I am not patient enough to wait for ice cream to soften), it looks great, and the lever actually works, unlike the ""trigger"" kind. The lever is the best feature, although it is annoying to have to clean behind it (again, much easier than any trigger scoop I have tried). OXO has made a good one, and it is my favorite of their four different scoops, both in terms of style and functionality (must confess to not using the ""Nonstick Beak"" kind; it looks pretty hot). I was worried, after purchasing an oxo ice cube tray, which I still haven't figured out how to use without having it freeze shut, that their products had started to decline in quality. This is one of their classics, and should last me a lifetime."
1,Very disappointing,"After buying Mrs Crowe's Blue Waltz and Guitar for Mortals, I was hooked...was. Sorry Adrian this one's a bummer and I won't take a chance on you again. :-("
3,Good for beginners,"The book have a lot of exercises and be careful with the answers. Check it with Books on line. I approve the exam with this material and the Course 756 System administration for MS SQL Server 6.5. Overall a concise, good book."
1,Keep looking...,"This book really missed the mark as a study guide. A good percentage of the information is inaccurate and conflicting. I found it next to impossible to navigate test questions for material not even covered. Once I encountered errors that just made it worse. I found myself double checking with the Microsoft's Books Online to resolve these issues. By the time I printed Books Online topics as a backup, I might as well have not had the book at all!"
4,Great piece of history,"Diocletian is probably not the most popular of the Roman emperors, but definitely one of the most influential.This is a very good book around the subject, well written and engaging without bee too technical.Good bibliographical notes to find other sources.Diocletian lived one of the most critical times in the Roman Empire and a turning point in Western history."
4,winsome,"Judging from the previous reviews of this recording, you either like the Sprouts' Andromeda Heights or you don't. I do. Perhaps I am not as musically sophisticated as some of their fans, but their latest has improved on all of the elements that I have always appreciated about their music: catchy melodies, lovely harmonies, and beautiful songs full of the wonder of love and life. I listen to different music for different reasons. I listen to Prefab Sprout to be reminded of how good it is to be alive and in love. Andromeda Heights did not disappoint."
4,"Good songs, so-so production","I think most of the songwriting on this album is on par with their (or really his) earlier albums. The production is rather glossy in a From Langley Park kind of way and that is alright with me. The real problem is that most instruments (perhaps even all) comes from samplers and such in Paddy's home studio. You can here when guitars, strings and drums are programmed rather than played and I feel that the album would had been a lot better if recorded with musicians. If you don't listen too close to the sounds, it's still very good music."
2,Very Disappointing,"I agree with my fellow Glass City Sprouts fan. If Paddy McAloon set out to make an album full of simple melodies and lyrics, he succeeded. I don't, however, listen to Prefab Sprout to hear such music. This album, front to back was a profound disappointment, even compared with the usual pop drivel out there. Compared with earlier Sprouts efforts, it was a tragic disappointment. There is very little musical or lyrical depth and substance on this record. It is simply uninteresting.Don't waste your money. If you haven't heard any albums from the band, check out Two Wheels Good, Swoon and Jordan. If you have, be extremely wary before buying Andromeda, and find a record shop that will let you listen to it before purchasing. On a positive note, I look forward to seeing what follows Andromeda. I'm confident that Paddy has some more platinum in the vault."
2,Disappointing after such a long wait,"There is a thin line between sensibility and downright cheesiness. While I still admire Paddy McAloon, I have to say that he went overboard on this one. Songs such as ""The Fifth Horseman"" exemplify the Sprouts' sometimes risible music in this album. You can still get a glimpse of this very fine band's genius in other songs such as ""Weightless"", ""Andromeda Heights"", and ""Electric Guitars"". However, I have listened to this album for several months hoping that it would grow on me to no avail. In case you're new to the Sprouts, try ""Swoon"". It is one of the best pop albums ever made. It will challenge you at first with its musical and lyrical whim, but it will definitely grow on you. Also, ""Two Wheels Good"" is an absolute classic."
3,disappointing,"I own everything they have ever put out and I was never more depressed when I bought this cd and was not immediately enraptured by it. I thought it would grow on me and it still hasn't. I just felt like the cd was audio wallpaper and I was never engaged by it. Some of the songs are quite touching, but as a whole it seems to be lacking."
2,too sharp,"I have been a homemaker for almost 20 years and I have a lot of experience peeling vegetables...I am fast and have rarely cut myself. However, I bought this peeler during the holidays and a few days ago I cut myself so severly with it, I thought about going to the hospital. This peeler seems to slide over the food quicker than others I have used and so it some how gives me an ""out of control"" feeling with each thrust. It is also extra sharp. I can't recomend this unless your fingers are made of stainless steel as well."
2,this isn't a great peeler...,"There's no doubt about it - this is an attractive looking peeler. However, looks aside - it doesn't really perform that great in the kitchen. It takes a long time to peel something as simple as a potato - either because of bad design or the fact that it's not that sharp. I wouldn't recommend it..."
2,Gets clogged,"I have to agree with the reviewer that said it takes too long to peel a potato with this peeler. The cover over the blade is supposed to keep the peelings from flying up, and it does that. But instead, they get caught under the cover and slow down the works. It's broad and obscures your view of the blade. I'm a fast peeler -- thanks to all of those potato peeling contests my mother used to have her children do -- and I did not like getting slowed down because I couldn't see exactly where the blade was going, or getting peelings caught under the blade cover. In addition, the sharp end for gouging out potato eyes is kind of rounded. On my old peeler it's pointed, and works much better. I'll keep looking for the older style, so I can get my peeling done faster."
1,hate it,"I have been buying OXO peelers for years. When they came out with a stainless top for the blade, I grabbed it and bought them for my kids. This one looked so sleek and attractive so I bought 3. Awful design, doesn't peel well, have to expend too much energy. The only thing i could say about it is that it looks nice."
2,"Great pianist, poor presentation","While it is a pleasure to have another Arrau performance of Beethoven's 5th piano concerto, the presentation is disappointing. First of all there are about 40 minutes introduction, with a montage of interviews, rehearsals and so on, with a devastating commentary. Afterwards you get a hum-drum performance with a rather mediocre orchestra, tiny sound and not much of a concept. But what is really annoying about this disc? Well, there's a gap between sound and image, a gap of less than a second, to be sure, but enough for a distraction from the presentation. Finally I chose to switch off my tv and preferred to listen only."
1,Out of Synch!,"For pianists hoping to watch Arrau's hands in this concerto, be warned, because the sound is out of synch with the video by about a second, rendering this DVD useless in my opinion."
2,not very good...,"i've read dozens of outlines in this biblical vien. read, 'what the bible is all about for young explorers' by henrietta mears. so far it's the best outline i've found. beth"
3,Not so sure.,"When this VCR is working properly, it's a great product. Unfortuantely, it didn't work properly for very long after I bought it. I have had severe problems with the vertical hold on tapes played or recorded on deck 2. Any tape copied on to deck 2 comes out unwatchabel on any other VCR due to the completely unsteady picture produced and tapes played on deck 2 also looks poor. No amount of head cleaning or tracking adjustment fixes the problem. I contacted the company via e-mail yesterday and have yet to receive a response. If I am able to get this problem fixed, this will be a great VCR, but if not, I will be very disappointed."
2,VERY DISPLEASED!!!,"We have only had our Go-Vidio Dual Deck VCR since August of 2000. After about 1 month..the 2nd deck started tracking extreamly bad. We have used the ""auto"" tracking and ""manual"" tracking and it does not seem to work. Also, We have tried to use a head cleaner on the 2nd deck...It still tracks extreamly bad...I've been very unhappy with this purchase..I've tried to call for help and all I get is a recording that says all the people are on other lines and to call back...I've done this repeatedly and never get anything but this recording...Where do I go for help?!!!!!"
5,I LOVE IT !!!!,I have had my Go Video for about 2 years - it works like a charm. It makes very good copies and is soooo easy to use. My Brother is on his second Go Video - he bought the 1st one ages ago when they cost a fortune and were quite unique. Have wanted one for years and finally the price is within reach.
3,Video Recorder Fan,"As a cable-box user, I had a major problem with the recorder. The ads fail to mention that if you're using a cable box, you cannot record one program and watch another program at the same time. It has to do with using only a single tuner. I only found this out after contacting the company directly. By the way, the 800 number is worthless. They never return your calls. However, they do respond to emails, fairly promptly. The other features work well, which prompts my 3 stars."
3,I could have done worse,"This really isn't the worst product I've ever gotten, but it has it's annoyances. My primary VCR tapes in LP, which I use frequently. However, trying to dub a tape in LP is horrible. If you put it in SP, it has this horrid red tint across the entire picture. If you put it in SLP (like the manuel suggests), it's almost unwatchable. And it also does not do well with SLP programs that either came from another VCR or are rather old. SP to SP is perfect though. I've also cut the ends of programs I'm dubbing off after pausing the tape to edit out commercials because the tape goes back 3-5 seconds. But it has come in quite handy and is easier than trying to hook up two VCRs together."
5,A Beginner's Guide to Brewing Beer,"This was the first book that I purchased on the subject of homebrewing. I met Charlie Papazian at a local bookstore and he signed my book with his favorite phrase ""Relax..Don't Worry..Have a Homebrew"". This book is well organized and is wriiten in an entertaining style. It is the perfect book for the beginner. It details, step-by-step, the basic instructions for brewing your first batch of beer. It also has sperate sections for intermediate and advanced homebrewing. An individual can find an answer to practically any question that he/she might have on the subject of brewing beer somewhere in this book. Among all the the books that I have on the subject of homebrewing, this is the one that I turn to most frequently. Papazian's writing style keeps the subject of brewing interesting from start to finish."
3,Bonehead Brewing 100,"This book is written for those who don't really know if they want to get serious about homebrewing or not. It outlines the steps necessary to brew a decent beer without getting into the art and science (Zymurgy). It took me about 2 hours to read cover-to-cover and if the words ""relax, don't worry, have a homebrew"" were omitted from the book it would be shortened to about half. The book is somewhat dated and does not cover the major improvements in homebrewing equipment that is now available. There are some good recipes included. Those who are serious would be better served to study Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide."
3,"The classic, but there are better starter books now.","More homebrewers have probably started with this book than any other, and Charlie is owed a great deal of thanks for helping to revive homebrewing in America. This book is fun to read, educational, and to its credit has all the information you need to start brewing. That said, it is also out of date and there are many other books more up to date on techniques, equipment, and ingredients that are just as friendly to the beginner."
4,Probably a close to a beginners book as I've seen.,"First off, revised and updated means Oct. 1991 so the serious brewer will find that some information is as old as the photo illustrations and might in some cases need updating. Once past that you'll find a lot of information on just about anything you might need it on, this is a good book for the beginner. I think there's something on all types of beers, even some stuff on ciders and meads. Buy this book if you're starting out, you'll learn much of what you'll need to get going. I've also seen this book quoted in some of the other brewing books, sounds like a pretty good endorsement to me."
5,Perfect companion book for my beginning efforts,This is the first book on home brewing I have read and consulted... has helped me get started in this facinating hobby.
2,The edition I recieved was out of date,"The New Complete Joys of Home Brewing is a celebrated book among homebrewers, and along with Miller's book of similar title are the two volumes you really need to begin to brew.That being said, The New Complete Joys of Home Brewing has be reprinted and updated many times. The one I received was published Second Edition 1991 by Avon Books and the cover is exactly as pictured on this page and was ordered from this page. While it will help you get your sea legs, much of the equipment has been updated since that time and many methods have been simplified and improved upon.While I wouldn't do without this book, you need The Complete Handbook of Home Brewing by Miller, David G also. Both have some different takes and points to make and Miller is more up to date."
4,Timeless classic,I have gotten some nice ideas out of this book.Beer brewing is fun as long as you don't mind washing the bottles- that is the only pain but the rest is fun.This book is a must read for anyone brewing beer at home or in a dorm room. Regardless if you are a beginner or expert this book this book has something for you. My beer mentor refers to it has the Holy Book of home brewing!
5,BEST Beginners Beer Book,This is the best beer book around for beginners. We made our first 5 gallons of Indian Pale Ale using this book. It was the very first time we made any type of beer. We expected to dump it all when we tasted it. But low and behold..we got 30 bottles (after spillage) of the best home brew we ever tasted. Well worth the money.
5,Essential,"If you brew beer, you MUST have this book! Everything you ever needed to start you out is in here. From beginners to pros, this book will help you."
2,Not very funny,"Except for the airplane sketch, this DVD isn't very funny. It shows future talent developing for the later Monty Python shows."
4,Very funny,"I honestly don't understand the negative reviews some people give. I bought this DVD yesterday, and I couldn't stop laughing. To my mind, some of the sketches (although crudely done) are slightly funnier than a lot of Monty Python stuff! Even the DVD itself was irritatingly funny, with the fingerprints (gosh, I hate those on my DVD's!) and the menu which doesn't take you were you want to be (it actually got me genuinly annoyed).Get this DVD version today - you won't regret it!"
2,Disappointing,"This tape seems to be a compilation of leftover skits that weren't deemed good enough for regular python shows. The only truly funny one was the Airline Pilots sketch, and John Cleese's intros. Only for diehard Python fans."
3,Come on now.,"I am a big fan of anything John Cleese but, five stars is a bit much, 3 1/2 is a bit more accurate."
2,Early Monty,"There are really only two sketches that are worth watching. The airline sketch, and the one with the car mechanic. Although John Cleese has a few good observations between sketches, it doesn't make up for the fact that it's not his BEST performance. He couldn't help it-this was early in his career.My best advice? Rent it. You'll get the same amount of entertainment for less money."
1,dissapointing,Very dull and dissapointing. I HIGHLY suggest renting it before you buy. You will be glad you only spent [PRICE] on a rental.
2,Mixed bag,"I'm a great fan of Fawlty Towers.This is a very mixed bag:- Cleese's introductions to each skit (in the form of a self-help lecturer) are well done- The two skits that made me laugh were the man trying to get the car dealer to fix the car he just purchased (as someone pointed out, a predecessor to the Dead Parrot skit) and the TV interviewer who doesn't allow the guest to say anything.- Most of the skits are so long and painful that they are hard to watch. Makes Monty Python seem subtle.- Afaid that I find men pretending to be old ladies to be very unfunny.Some good bits, but not at all his best."
4,A must-have for Python fans!,"I enjoyed this DVD very much. As a die-hard Python fan, it was great fun for me to watch John Cleese, Graham Chapman, and my favorite Python Michael Palin in this program. The show is very clever and the entire cast is very funny (and very annoying, but that's the point). It's also fun to see the (very) early incarnations of ""Dead Parrot"", ""Dirty Fork"", and ""Silly Job Interview"".If you're a Python fan, I highly recommend rounding out your collection with this excellent DVD."
2,Not all that great,"Boring. Unfunny. Actually irritating to watch. Which I guess makes it a brilliant meta-comedy...No. It's boring, unfunny, and irritating to watch. The second half is a bit better. There are several pieces which were later re-used in Monty Python -- some vastly reworked (Groveling Waiter, Quiz Show), some recreated almost verbatim (Job Interview). At least one sketch (Discussion Show) was reprised from ""At Last the 1948 Show,"" which Cleese, Chapman and Brooke-Taylor had done (with Marty Feldman) the year before.As a glimpse of the Pythons just before they became Pythons, it is moderately interesting. As a piece of entertainment, it's not."
3,"OK, not as polished as later work, feels dated.","This is early work, and the team became much better with experience. People who are into the history and development of the Monty Python humour will enjoy this. But anyone expecting the polished sophistication of ""Fawlty Towers"" or ""Monty Python"" is likely to be somewhat disappointed."
2,Disappointing,"I agree with others who have written weak reviews. As a Cleese fan, I was disappointed that the pacing was so slow and that frankly it just got boring after a while. Cleese must have learned some lessons from this project, because his later work is far superior.Fawlty Towers - The Complete Serieswill always be a personal favorite by any comedian, any genre."
2,not flexible,"I purchased this product with the assumption that the blade was flexible as the description says. However, i was quite disappointed to find that the blade barely bent under pressure from my hand and was not nearly flexible enough to gently slide under the first piece of pie. RSVP makes a much better flexible pie server."
5,purchased 2nd as a gift,"Great for pizza. I liked the first one so much, I went ahead and ordered a second as a gift."
4,Good pie server,"Handle comfortable and easy to use. Perfect size for a normal size piece of pie. It cuts neat, clean slices."
3,Early Rankin showing promise,"This is the first American release for an early novel by British writer Ian Rankin, author of the award-winning ""John Rebus"" series of mysteries. Michael West is an assassin and when he is double crossed after murdering a journalist, he must go on the run with assistance from the daughter of an arms dealer to find out who set him up. He is chased by a drug-addled American private eye who will stop at nothing to take him down. Ranking throws in the kitchen sink on this one: cops, crooks, spies and cults all take part in the narrative with plenty of shoot 'em up action along the way. The ending is a little contrived, but the story works for the most part, and shows how talented a writer Rankin was even at this early stage."
1,Major thumbs down for this Rankin failure,"This book is so bad in so many ways, starting with the concept of hit man as sympathetic protagonist and finishing with the pathetic ending that is supposed to show redemption. Along the way the plot goes downhill after a semi-gripping opening assassination, the action becomes ridiculous, and the relationship between Bel and the hit man that starts out creepy becomes predictable and annoying. Rankin's writing equals the triteness of his story.Rankin's Rebus series is mostly excellent, but this book is garbage compared to those novels. Did Rankin feel like he wanted to try writing something different, something edgy? Whatever the reason, this books is a failure. I only finished reading it so I can reach 100 books read this year (2011) as December ends."
2,Characters could not hold my interest,"I agree with an earlier reviewer, that none of these characters are very likable. This was my first experience with Ian Rankin, after being told many times that I would love his writing [guess I should have started with a John Rebus story]. I never got into any of the characters, did not believe them or their motivations, and really struggled to care what happened to them. Really, the most interesting character is the woman who gets killed in the opening chapter. Finally, just gave up after about 150 pages, flipped to the back and read the last few chapters and the ""twist"" was what I expected. Blah."
4,Vrlo Dobro,"The great strength of Pimsleur materials is due to the fact that because they work only on verbal skills, you are actually able to SPEAK and UNDERSTAND the target language when you've finished. This set is designed for the complete beginner, so if you already speak some Croatian it may be too elementary. Nevertheless, it's great for providing survival Croatian.(...)One more thing: I haven't had a chance to use the Croatian here with Bosnians. Whether you see Croatian, Bosnian, and Serbian as dialects of one language or as individual languages in their own right is up to you, but the material presented here is probably generic and simple enough to communicate with people from virtually anywhere in the former Yugoslavia. Heh heh... I've already been complemented on my beautiful Serbian!!!"
1,Disappeared!,A princess disappeared and the Trenchcoat Twins were asked to find her. Can they find her? Read this book to find out.
2,This book was very boring,"I thought thst the characters in this book were fake and unreal. The twins, for example. They never fought with eachother and always got along. Another bad thing was that the plot stunk and the case was easy to solve. I did give this book 2 stars, though, because the ticket lady seemed real and it had good descriptions.P.S. Mary-Kate and Ashely do not have strawberry-blond hair!"
4,Mary-Kate and Ashley are in another great adventure!,"This is a really good book. I really love the twins, though. But enev if you don't, I'm sure you will enjoy the great mystery and suspence that leaves you turning the pages until the 'Trenchcoat Twins' solve the case. I would reccommend this book to anyone who loes the girls, and/OR loves great mysteries. it took me about 45-60 minutes to read. Happy reading wishes!"
5,Needs to be put on DVD.,"The movie was fine the only problem was that the VHS version that I bought was not for renting nor sale. I remember seeing this movie on showtine in 2000, and I quickly noticed that the film had been edited in several parts (espcially the love scenes). I was very disappointed. In short the movie was great for a low budget movie, I just hope that it comes out on DVD uncut, and unedited in the future so I can get the real thing."
3,Can't cut 3/16 inch bolts,"Although the opening at the top of the bolt cutters is 3/16 of an inch, it tapers quickly. You will not be able to fit that size bolt in the bolt cutters. If you have a bolt which is greater than 1/8 of an inch, you're better off going with a larger size bolt cutter."
3,UPDATED REVIEW!!!,"UPDATE:Originally I gave these 1 star. I was contacted by a Tekton Representative who sent me another pair of the same ""bolt cutters."" I took this new pair and really went to town testing their limits. I still do not believe these should be called ""bolt cutters"" as they still have a difficult time cutting through decorative wire chain, but they will cut a non-coated fence pretty well. The odd thing is the decorative chain is smaller in diameter then the fence but these cutters just barely do the job.As bolt cutters stay away. If you want a pair of fence/small gauge wire cutters these will do okay. I Don't know how long they will hold up and will continue to update this review as I learn more.In the end I'm upping the star count less on the quality of the product and more on the quality of the service and company. When they stand behind a product I am willing to give it another go."
1,8 inches of nothing,"It can't be used. The opening between the blades is only about 1/4"" wide. It doesn't get any wider than that so if you needed it to cut something...Good luck. It was a total waste of money and I still have a door chain hanging down that needs to come off."
2,cheap,"Pros-cheap, good for small jobsCons-dulls quickly, grips hard on the hands, and the tension spring requires more force to squeeze then what its takes to cut metal"
5,The only Mexican Cookbook that I trust,"This is only one of 2 cookbooks that I will ever need. I was looking for a cookbook that was authentic and not watered down. Since I am Mexican/American I am very picky about my Mexican food and this book is the real deal.It is also the only reliable reference that I have found for making tamales exactly the way they should be made. If you ever wanted to make ""real"" tamales. Get this book."
5,Excellent Source of Information,"Like some of the others here, I came across this book because I work for a website that contains information about cosmetic surgery. I research articles and books for the website Breast Implants USA, and Dr. Engler's book has helped my understanding of many procedures and products. He speaks in a clear, concise way which is understandable by the lay person -- which is great because, if you've ever researched this stuff, you know how difficult it can be to understand some of the medical terminology. Engler takes the extra effort to make all the information real, interesting and accessible."
4,"great tablet, unsatisfied with the mouse","I was so excited when I received the tablet. Although it is quite expensive,it is a must-have tool for any digital artist. I used the graphire(512 levels of pressure) before, however I don't feel much difference with Intuos2 (1024 levels).The included software is great. The driver setup is also excellent. It allows you to set the button to perform different functions in different program.The pen is also very comfortable to use. It came with few spare pen tips too. But the mouse is disappointing. The hard side edges is not comfortable to use. It is not as smooth as using an ordinary mouse.I will give 5 stars if it have a better mouse and ... cheaper."
1,if you really love blue and old software then....,"this product is for you. No one should be confused...this product is not the most current model from Wacom. The only reason why you would buy this product is if you are in love with the color blue and don't mind the older software. This product is bundled with Photoshop Elements 1.0 and Painter 1.01. Painter 1.01 is not compatible with OSX. In contrast to customer reviews, Photoshop Elements 2.0 has NEVER been bundled with this model. If you want the more current software Wacom offers with the 6X8 tablet (which DOES include Photoshop Elements 2.0 and a newer version of Painter, which is OSX compatible) then buy the newer model (XD68USBPLAT). It is gray. I was told by a Wacom rep that the only difference between the two tablets is the color. The tablet itself seems to be a great product. Again, no one should ever be confused about what they think they are buying. Hope this helps."
5,I completely love my Wacom,I wanted a larger Wacom but I couldn't get one because Wacom was having problems with a supplier. I ordered the 6x8. I find that it works very well and fits on my desk top nicely. It performs like a dream. The Wacom installed easily. I had a few problems with the USB settings in my computer that the Wacom Tech helped me solve. The product is very nice and they have a good tech support team to back it up. I consider that more important than the product itself.I'm planning on buying another Intuos for my 2nd work station.
5,Glad I bought it!,"I finally splurged for this Wacom tablet (6""x8"") and am I ever glad I did... and wish I had done it much sooner! This item arrived and within minutes I had it hooked up to my computer (and I'm not very computer literate) and within half hour I was actually drawing pictures with great success as I explored what all it could do. This thing is just amazing in the controls you have and the ease of use. The size is perfect not being too big or too small. If you are into any kind of artistry, I honestly think you'd be well satisfied buying this one especially because of the ease in using it."
2,C is for...Warmaster???,"I bought this one on a whim when I was a lad, and immediately hated it. On a few more listens, I found a little bit to like, but not much. The songs all pretty much sound the same, and only a couple have some interesting things going on (Shreds of Sanity, Profane Creation). Basically, death metal, and hardly memorable. The guy sings in a hoarse monotone the whole way through and the drumming is by the numbers. There are pretty pictures of cybernetic penis-guns in the booklet, but other than that... well, lets just say that I don't plan on keeping this one in my stereo in the years to come."
5,Ghost Stories Galore,"Shadows and Cypress: Southern Ghost Stories is the best collection of ghost stories I've seen. Many have been gathered from the old WPA collections, and many have been collected in the oral tradition. Dr. Brown is an expert on the classification of folk lore. His expertise in this area is evident. The collection includes selections suitable for use by all ages."
3,I was a little disappointed...,"I usually love ghost stories, and being from the south I thought I would love the stories in this book, but I was a little disappointed. It was ok, but some of the stories were a little silly."
3,I DONT RECOMMEND THIS ONE!,"Ive read quite a few ghost story books the past few months and I found this to be one of lesser quality. The author uses actual dialect with the storytellers accent, I found it most annoying making it a hard read at times.( I dont speak or read southern backwoods uneducated jibberish!! ) Some of the stories told were interesting, although I much prefer real ghost accounts over urban legend type. Instead read any of the books by Troy Taylor, Coast to Coast Ghosts, or Ghosts Of Key West."
4,"Beautiful, Sad","Who hasn't had an unrequited love, or a young love that was mutual, but somehow, someway, you wind up with other people and wonder how that happened. Anyone who has been in either situation knows what Deanie is feeling at the end of the movie when she visits Bud.And speaking of Bud, I got so angry with him for letting his Father lead him around by the nose ring. Bud may have loved Deanie, but he was cruel too. I wanted to strangle him. People have talked about this movie as if not having sex is what drives Deanie crazy. I don't see it that way. Bud suddenly giving her the cold shoulder is what drove her out of her mind. How can you love someone one minute, then suddenly give them the deep freeze? Its unbelievably cruel."
2,A young punk's cruelty destroys a tender flower of a girl,"I totally agree with the SECOND part of the ""viewer from Texas'"" opinion above: this was a movie about how a man broke a woman's heart when social mores prevented her from satisfying his shallow, self-serving lust (NOT love). Natalie Wood was sweet and almost incredibly beautiful, but I never liked Warren Beatty--he wasn't worth it, Honey!This movie made me sad and angry--I would much more recommend something with a happy ending and better love chemistry between the players--like Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen (hubba, hubba!) in ""Love with the Proper Stranger."" McQueen turns out to be a gentleman (a REAL man!), not the cad Beatty is!If you don't have enough to cry about in your own life, rent this movie, but don't buy it!"
3,Deeply silly,"Even for uptight 1961, this film plays a bit dumb. Think about it. The impossibly sexy Natalie Wood, who was married to Robert Wagner at the time, plays a supposed virgin who goes nuts over her love for the young Warren Beaty, who would go on to make a career out of driving every woman in Hollywood nuts. Both stars were in their 20s here, but were attempting to play late high school teens. The crux of the whole thing is their repressed desire for sex, which not only sends Natalie to the loony bin for almost 4 years, but sends Warren back to the farm where we find him married to some dumb pizza waitress with a dirty baby crawling on the floor of their farmhouse. Oh, and it's supposed to be 1928-29 when the stock market crashed. The look of the film is interesting on 1080p DVD. Both stars were very pretty in their heyday. But the ridiculous 'plot' can only make you laugh today. Still, how many movies nowadays are based on a few lines of William Wordsworth poetry? None."
3,Disappointing classic,"A little too soapy for my taste. The relationship between Beatty and his father was the most interesting aspect of the story. (Pat Hingle is great!) Every time I felt like I was starting to get close to the characters, the action would jump ahead a few years, which served to distance me from the story. Also, I never really understood why Wood's attraction to Beatty was so strong. It seemed to be too intense too fast."
2,Definetly not a turn pager,"I am a great admirer of Natalie Wood. The facts read in the book and the sequence of her life seemed to be very credible. The style in which the book was written,however, was trite ,redundant and poor. I regretted turning each page--a real sleeper. All in all, the book was insiteful .A long waited for biography,too bad it was boring."
3,Splendor in the Grass,One of my favorite movies. I can't say much more than that. Natalie Wood and Warren Beatty are in their element.
5,"splendor in the grass, what's not to like about this movie ?!","what a great movie, warren beatty in his first movie, natalie wood when she was young. a love story with a lesson, but not ""preachy"", just enjoyable to watch."
5,Splendor In The Grass,Purchased as a gift. Receiver loves a lot of old movies and they can usually be found on Amazon's movie section.
2,Kazan falters,"Natalie Wood is a fresh, young and attractive actress who is reasonably effective in the lead role, but the film left me dissatisfied on several counts. First, it does not convey anything of the mentality of the American mid-west in the 1920s, when it is set. You can buy the wardrobe and the old cars; that's not enough. This film was made in the 1960s and reeks of the 60s. Secondly, the story is paper thin: girl and boy, in love at school, cannot sexually consummate the relationship because of family and social mores; girl goes off her head and boy marries someone else. It is neither splendid nor green -- but worn and arid. The story meanders through its telling; a key character -- Bud's sister -- brings it to life briefly, then she suddenly disappears out of the plot, as aimlessly as she entered. Elia Kazan has made some great films, with well-focused ideas. Not this one."
1,late,"late, late , late , oh did i say late ...paid for next day , did not leave for 5 days AFTER i got a confirm email ..not happy at all ....movie was perfect , but too late guests gone"
5,"Powerful, Personal, and Profound","The power of Chris Whitley's talent is on full display here. This album contains a broad tapestry of themes and motifs that deepen after almost every listen. Whitley's compositions are first rate, and his playing is more than up to the task. This is clearly the work of a true artist, someone who takes what he does very seriously and who respects his audience.Most impressive."
4,wow,"This is a great acoustic album. This Whitley guy really knows how to play a National, not to mention write some seriously deep lyrics. When's his next album due out??"
3,This awesome talent could benefit from an awesome producer.,"Chris Whitley has natural musical talent most aspiring artists would kill for, yet at times he seems to be haphazard and inconsistent. Still searching for that ultimate ""high"" he achieved on ""Living With The Law"", possibly one of the top ten debuts of all time. His fans have been patient, grasping at hints of his genius on his follow-up works, yet always being left short of the mark. ""Dirt Floor"" is finally a solid clue the man is back on track. But for all the potential in these songs, the work is hardly more than a demo tape; how awesome this could have been with Malcom Burn or Daniel Lanois producing!! And I don't care how you justify it; a 26 minute CD doesn't make sense. I am in awe of Chris. I am in awe of his songs - but they need a little better showcase than this effort."
3,Chris Whitley's Dirt Floor CD,It's A Pretty Good CD.I Miss Chris Whitley.Chris Was So Great. His Style Of Music Was One Of A Kind.Love Ya Chris.
5,the best of the ''best of'' albums for Kiss,"I do not own this album,but judging from that fine lookin'tracklist that it contains,This is a VErY GOOD album and is a excellent album.It is better than the album ''Greatest kiss''for a variety of reasons,including that this album has BETTer songs including hits from the 80's.This album has cool cover art also. This contains most of kiss' Best hits(Kiss has too many hits,but these are the most importand)I think that this album shouldn't only be an imported album-I think that it should of been rleased in the U.S.A too."
5,Kiss-Love Gun,"Hey People, Tired of not hearing enough real down to earth rock n' roll on that radio? If you answered yes to this question, Kiss's album Love Gun is your solution. Beggining with the grinding track ""I Stole Your Love"" and continuing on with classics such as ""Christine Sixteen"", ""hooligan"", ""Love Gun"", ""Plaster Caster"" and their touching cover of ""then she kissed me"" Love Gun is certain to be one of your favorites."
4,Awake Jazz Fans!,"Until the superb ""Conflict"" shows its pretty face on CD (the album features the incredible lineup of Carmell Jones, Harold Land, Andrew Hill, George Tucker and Elvin Jones!), ""Awakening"" is a great place to start with this fine alto-saxophonist. This album, recorded over two sessions in late 1961 and early 1962, features either Joe Gordon or Martin Banks on trumpet, Amo Trice or Dick Whittington on piano, Jimmy Bend or Gary Peacock on bass, and Milt Turner on drums. Don't worry, I've never heard of most these guys either (the exceptions being Gordon who played on Shelly Manne's ""Blackhawk"" recordings (see my reviews), and of course Peacock), but they all play quite solidly. The material is straight ahead hard bop, and the album's best tracks are ""Circus,"" ""Roma"" and a nice version of the standard ""Love for Sale."" This CD is a limited edition so curiousity seekers should go for it soon."
1,warning,"Stopped working in the first month, had only used a few times. Tried replacing batteries, filling with spray and nothing..."
4,Amityville Part 4.,"After the famous haunted house on Long Island is exorcised, the evil does not die but escapes to another home in California. The familiar things begin to take place again, Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt are being terrorised this time. Well Made T.V film. The last shot with the cat is hilarious!"
5,"finally, a sequel that lives up to the origional!","the only reason i considered watching this movie was to be able to say that i have watched all the Amityville movies, and did not expect to enjoy it. however, i loved it. patty duke was a wonderful actress, and the little girl was great at playing creepy! i would recommend this video to my friends in a heartbeat!"
1,Boring!!,"A story of a couple who met in Paris, fell in love, then got married happily after...... No sorry, they didn't, not immediately.They fell in love at first, then were faced with reality that started diminshing their love gradually. They started having fights and conflicts, then eventually they got back together and were happily in love ever after.I found the film to be boring. Its quite long, full of unnecessary details, typical early 90s movie! It wasn't funny, wasn't even romantic. We didn't even get much of France or the French culture except in the begining. Even the name Forget Paris doesn't make sense because we don't get much of France. They meant by the name to forget the lovely times both couples had in Paris.A movie about a regular couple having regular experiences. NO VALUE ADDED.Quite boring, maybe we today do not have the patience to watch classic films."
3,An okay romantic comedy...,"There wasn't a whole lot of romance going on but ""love"" was in the air or should I say Paris. Would have been better if it was a bit more cleaner. (tv g works great) I thought Billy Crystal and Debra Winger worked well together! It is not a family movie."
5,a perfect movie,"Hay!! I am Onur Alpturk from Ankara, Turkey. As the title of my review indicates, i think that this movie is really great. I just dont write this statemne\ent just because of the fact that i am a fan of billy crystal but in stead because of his manner of reflecting ,in a honoust way, what does take place between a man and a woman. all the idea, all the feeling are completely true. i got really suprised when i noticed it. the way he missed her, the way they fight with each other (especially about moving to dallas). I think this is the general of policy of billy crystal. so, if you really want to see the facts, i strongly suggest this movie."
3,Better Than Average,"This is not a great movie, but I have to admit it is better than most romantic comedies out there. There are at least two or three ""laugh-out-loud"" moments (my favorite is the pigeon scene), but for the most part it is just okay. I thought my lack of enthusiasm could be attributed to the fact that this is more of a ""chick flick,"" but alas, my wife felt the same way.Using the friends of the main characters to tell the story in flashback is an interesting device, but overall this film is only a little bit better than average."
2,It was ok not great as I expected!,"I chose this rating because Billy Crystal and Debra Winger have always done fantastic performances but this movie, I felt, left a lot to be desired. It was just ok but not at all funny like I expected. Sue H."
3,Too Many Attempts at Jokes.,"Viewed: 6/03, 11/11Rate: 511/11: Eh, Forget Paris works well for a storytelling, but when it comes to the story per se, I think constantly how bland it was. The problem is terribly obvious: they never really knew each other in the first place before they got married. And the marriage was doomed right from the start. All the signals are there staring at their faces. All of that are what made the film to be tedious to watch. Another obvious problem, besides making her to laugh, what else is there about him? Exactly...my point. Also, the film has one too many jokes yet two out of five probably made me to laugh: too overdone. Debra Winger looks like she never believed in the film. Seeing her, I would gladly take An Officer and a Gentleman or Urban Cowboy over Forget Paris anytime of the day. All in all, the title says it all: Forget Paris. I am dropping the rating from `7' to `5'."
4,"Fun movie, great acting, memorable.","Sometimes my son and I still go by various stores, and repeat in a monotone the store names, just like Ellen's father did, which drove Mickey crazy, of course.My husband and I sometimes buy movies and then re-sell them after watching them if we are unimpressed; this one has been added to the collection of films that we will watch more than once."
3,DVD Doesn't run well on computers,"Just as a supplementary note to all of the other reviews - the DVD version stutters and ultimately freezes on both my desktop (Win 98) and laptop (XP) while both computers have no problems playing other DVDs, even those with multiple access points. I haven't tried it on a standard TV-connected DVD player."
4,Good overall workout,"This DVD is separated into three segments: core conditioning, metabolic booster and am/pm rejuvenator. Each segment is about 20 minutes long and depending on your mood, you can mix and match the workouts. I like all three segments, especially the am/pm rejuvenator because the instructor mixes yoga moves with stretching to help calm as well as awaken your body. I just wish the metabolic booster was a bit longer. By the time your heart really gets pumping, it is time to cool down. This is great for people looking for variety of exercises and those who don't have a lot of time to workout!"
4,"Great, no-nonsense workout!","You don't have to be a dancer to do this routine! This workout is challenging yet not overly strenuous. I really like Jennifer Kries' friendly, professional style. Her cuing is easy to follow and her form is impeccable. The music in the Metabolic Booster section is very motivating! It can definitely get you into an aerobic state even though it's low impact enough to be done barefoot. The good news is, the 'no dialogue' music-only option is nice if you have the routine memorized; the bad news is, this DVD is not in stereo. However, it's an excellent overall workout that can improve your flexibility, strengthen your abs (and other muscles!), and the yoga section is both energizing and relaxing without getting too fussy. If you're new to Pilates, this DVD is a good choice!"
4,pilates and more,"Jennifer Kries is an excellent instructor. You can see so in the way she cues each exercise, how she demonstrates the advanced and beginner version of each movement and how she aware that it takes time to master pilates and become as flexible as her. She even takes time to explain breathin techniques although I think this should be a separate short section since it takes a few minutes from the core and rejuvenation workouts and you don't really need to see the explanation everytime. In this DVD she has three sections core, methabolic booster (good music by the way) and rejuvenation. Each section is 20 minutes long. I believe the workout provides what it promises: strength, balance, grace and flexibility. What more do you want?"
3,A good Mix,"I thought that the perfect mix was more of a good mix than a perfect mix. I love Jennifer Kries style but as for easiest for first timers, I'd recommend her Pilates Target Specifics before any other from the series."
3,good core conditioning and stretching,"This is my first try for Pilates. This dvd (or tape) is divided in 3 categories. First one is the core (abs) part. Very effective. I like it a lot. My abs were burning. I will do this part everyday. The second is the ""metabolic booster"". You need some dumbells to execute it. Well this part is ok to follow but I did't sweat as much as I expected. Maybe I should have heavier dumbells. I guess it is ok in the morning when you don't have too much time, just before going to work. But the stretches are very good. The last part is ""am/pm rejuvenation"" it is a soft mix of pilates and yoga: good for relaxing and stretching at the same time. I do it at night.To sum up: good core conditioning and stretching DVD. If you want to sweat a lot, buy another dvd."
3,not bad,"I think this is a good beginner workout tape, but would not recommend this to advanced Pilates enthusiasts. Maybe it's just me, and this was my first Jennifer Kries tape, but I just don't like her - She talks too much, and seems totally fake in her presentation. It was not a FUN workout for me, but I can't say it is not a good workout. It definitely targets all the right areas, but I just wanted something with a little more oomph! I know this will NOT be the first tape I'll want to grab every morning to work out to..."
2,Unght. Not for me at all.,"Jennifer Kries certainly shouldn't have called her DVD ""Pilates Method"", as it has very little in common with pilates - and a great deal in common with Jane Fonda. I found her voice and instructions grating, and certainly don't anticipate using the DVD again. The NYC Ballet Workout is a much better adaptation of pilates related techniques."
1,Lousy quality,This has very little to do with Pilates and the quality really [is bad]. It was a real disappointment. The best DVD I have seen was Pilates for Dummies...
1,Like home made video...,"I recently purchased this DVD and I'm not happy about it. There is very little variety of exercises. The 3 different programs (4 actually but one of them is a silent repeat of the cardio program) don't give you enough time to work out. You don't sweat at all. It would have been an ""ok"" beginners stretching program if the quality of video wouldn't be so bad. I wouldn't call it ""yoga"" either. I felt like I was watching poor cable work out. The cover actually is much prettier than what's behind it..."
1,Mac DVD player users beware,The DVD totally freezes up my Mac so I haven't been able to view it. Sending it to a friend and using Ana Caban's DVD instead (which works fine).
2,DVD not working well,"The only reason why I gave it a low rating is that the DVD doesn't work well. It plays in my DVD fine, but when I play it on my laptop, there's no sound. Also, I have yet to find the 'multi-angle' aspect on the DVD. Other than that, it's a standard workout. Not good for beginners, though."
4,Short on Feng Shui but long on Entertainment,"While this book was very short on useful feng shui information from a FS consultant's point of view, it was extremely entertaining in other ways. I really enjoyed the symbolism of the different plants in Chinese culture, the aromatherapy-as-applied-to-gardens section, and the useful listing of Oriental plant materials, their history, and cultivation data. No photos, but, hey, you can't have everything. Forget the Feng Shui part, it's still a great book on Chinese garden lore."
1,Be carefull I broke two allready,This product is junk. I like most oxo products but this one is poorly designed. The hadle is spot welded and can not hold any weight. My second one broke after shaking the remains of a stock out. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!
1,it broke in the first month,I agree with the reviewer who said this was junk. The spot welds holding the handle on the strainer broke when straining stock. Don't buy this product.
1,Eminently Useless Collection of Arts & Crafts Wall & Wallpaper Designs,"The description for this book is quite vague so allow me to clear things up before you waste your money. First there is a series of short but windy chapters dealing with various aspects of design philosophy. Forty pages worth, to be exact. The rest of the book is a series of colour plates - ""Studies in Design"" - that are thoroughly hideous, intended to be used as patterns for wall paper, friezes, borders, ceiling paintings, dado-rails, etc. The author describes them as ""grotesque"" on several occasions and he's right, but not the way he intended. If you've ever looked through a book of wallpaper samples, you've got the idea. You can see one piece of a pattern, but never an application in the whole cloth.Almost nobody needs this book. Unless you're researching Arts & Crafts or Art Deco interior designs, or making reproduction wallpaper for the period, it is useless. Avoid."
1,a bad pic!,"I would not get this camera for anyone. We bought one for our daughter and she took pics all day xmas day and when we down loaded them they were all black, some with red blurs. Talk about disappointing!"
3,second season from JP,"This box set has the second season of SD Gundam Force, which didn't air in the US. It extends the storyline of the first season as the main characters go to the alternate worlds where some of the Gundams came from to free them from the Dark Axis as they did Neotopia.My grandkids enjoyed the first set, and I hope this pleases them as well. Don't expect deep or dramatic storylines here, this series was targeted for the grade-school set, and succeeds as such."
3,Good Bottle Opener,"Bottle opener works great, priced right, but will not hang up on our magnetic wall strip holder."
4,Home Recordings Is,"I grew up listening to my brother & his buddies literally practicing in the garage. They were good enough to have a ""following"" parked in our backyard, curbside & behind our home - much to my dad's dismay. Although a long time Elvis fan, I've only recently began collecting Elvis music. This really IS some guy with a recording device sitting next to Elvis & his pals. So if you can - sit back, close your eyes & picture yourself in Elvis' den with a glass of lemonade. All our friends are here & they are just relaxing & singing & most of the time they sound really good. Sometimes, they just want to have fun. Don't we all? And someone thought to turn on the tape machine & now we can recall those fond memories of sitting around & just being. It's like carrying a worn out photo of you & your best friends pulling it out & saying oh yea, remember. . ."
4,A Rare Find,"This was a disc that I knew would be unique. Other people make this disc out to be no good, but as you can see, these ar HOME recordings and Elvis did not have to be at the mercy of the record producer. This disc is laid back and easy on the ears.It is one disc I amproud to add to my collection."
2,Wasted Talent !,"It is clear from listening to these recording,especially the ones made in the sixties,how astray Elvis' vision of who he was in the recording studio, had gone. Only in his gospel work do we hear the close harmonies that are evident on a lot of the songs recorded here (again,most dramatically from the 60's). Judging by what he recorded at home, and what he recorded for public consumption, the damage done to his career by the B movies becomes much clearer.For example,""Tumblin' Tumbleweeds"",of all things, has a grace and beauty to it that Elvis rarely bothered to try to achieve at this time in the studio. If Elvis would have been truer to his musical roots, and adamant about recording what he loved, he would have never needed a ""68 Comeback"", because he would have never left."
2,Elvis at Home!,"Having just read Peter Guralnick's Careless Love, this new release intrigues me, but I wish I had more information. When were these recordings made? Are these all from the 1970's? How bad is the sound? Is the King's voice already shot? How does it compare to, say, the ""Million Dollar Quartet"" disc?"
1,Red and Sonny Unplugged!,"Do not, under any circumstances, be tempted to purchase this CD. I expected the sound quality to be poor, and it certainly is, but what's most disappointing about this CD is Elvis is drowned out on many tracks by the flat voices of his buddies, Sonny and Red. If you are a fan of Elvis' bodyguards for some reason, I suppose this might be of some interest, but otherwise, this is for completists only.These recordings were mostly made in the 1970's in the Jungle Room at Graceland on a small, home reel to reel machine. Voices go on and off mic, there are strange thumps and noises in the background, and various other annoyances that one might expect of a ""historical recording."" Really, the best thing about this CD is the picture of Elvis in uniform on the cover."
1,Like watching home movies,"Elvis at his most ""unplugged"". This is Elvis playing and singing with friends. Very informal and not very pleasant to listen to. I suppose if you are an Elvis fan and a completist, you would probably buy this. However, due to the poor sound quality and questionable quality of the performances, you may not play this more than once."
1,Very disappointing,"I purchased this CD about a month ago and was very disappointed in it. I wasn't expecting great sound quality, but I did expect something better than this. There is too much laughing and constant chatter on this CD. If only ""the guys"" had taken a hike while Elvis was singing. The saddest thing is many of these songs would have been beautiful had Elvis recorded them professionally. I have many of Elvis' recordings, but this is one that I wish I had saved my money on."
5,Just buy it!,Simply Brilliant! Worth the price just to watch Gabriela sing Fire of Love (10). Bob James and Fourplay are the icing on the cake!
4,Full of jazz legends,"The list of living jazz musicians making an appearance on this DVD is astounding, and believe me when I say... they were at the top of their form! The recording quality is excellent and the music mix was good. The video quality was great (remember this is a live concert) except the fades to new shots to frequent for my taste, but not so much as to cause me not to enjoy every minute. Thats the good news. The only bad news is for those listeners who prefer very structured music just like it is on most of these artists individual albums. This is a losely structured jam session. But for me, that is what will make this one of my most played DVD's in my 100+ collection."
5,Million Dollar Concert,If there was ever a DVD to buy this is IT Great performances If your not up dancing you must be dead
5,Simply the Best!!!,"This DVD offers you an elite group of smooth jazz artists collaborating to give you smooth jazz ""live"" at it's best. The sound and picture quality are great. Each artist demonstrates their versatility during their solos on each song. Don't sleep on this one, it's a keeper!!! I only wish that more artists would consider offering their performances on DVD."
5,Best of the Living Legends,My father first introduced me to this CD as a 78 in the late fifties. I have loved it and the tradition from which it arises ever since. It is wonderful to have it available on CD. This is extraordinarily rich music. 100% pure!
4,Making Otis proud,"This trio, which includes Otis Redding's sons Otis III and Dexter, came about in the 80s, and while they don't exactly come across as gritty, soulful clones of the great Mr. Redding, they do turn out a solid set of old school 80s grooves, particularly ""Third Party"" and the hit ""Where Did Our Love Go"" (not to be confused with the Supremes hit of the same name)."
5,a+,"Nothing compares to this pack and believe me I need something like this in my office and bought tons of books like this and none of them were satisfying, until I discovered this, simply brilliant"
5,great edition,"This is a CDROM edition, in my opinion the best method to pack indexes and directories. Smart move by the publisher, Platinum Millennium made a smart choice by putting its very successful yellow pages series on a compact disk, it's the best choice and now searching is made a million times easier. I recommend this to all"
2,Returned,"No very what we expected the shirt is heavy cotton, okay, I guess, but the appliques looked a little cheap."
5,Best bang for the buck,This is by far one of the most complete clamp sets available today. Very good quality. Works really well with Bowclamps and is a great addition to the K-Body clamps. This is the set to buy if you are just starting or need to replace your clamps with others.
5,THE GREATEST CLAMPS ON EARTH !,"Having so many of Bessey's shows I did not go wrong by buying quantity with quality that will last a lifetime. I do own some Jorgensen clamps and on the wooden handles the rivets stick out cutting into your hand while tightening. Don't go cheap on the first clamps like I did, buy quality."
3,Spring a little extra for the parallel clamps.,"Title says it all. I am a believer in the saying that you can never have too many clamps laying around, but every time I use them, I wish I had the parallel clamps."
4,Good tool,"This is a good quality tool. I expected the 'good grips' handles to be soft and squishy, but they are quite hard. They don't slip around though, even when wet, which is nice."
5,Sturdy & Comfortable,"I previously had a ""Brand X"" melon baller which, with occasional use, developed a cracked handle which I had to tape to keep together and later, the scoop end broke off! I broke down and got the best... the OXO is really sturdy and, as with all their products, comfortable to use. I can tell I'll get years of use out of it without it falling to pieces like my previous one. It just goes to show, even with a product that only gets occasional use, it doesn't pay to get a cheap one!"
3,Hurts my hand.,"I have a melon baller like this one, Im not sure it is exactly the same model, something you might want to consider is that Ive found the two-scoop models like this hurts my hand severely when I use them, the opposite end cuts into my hand. Im getting rid of mine and switching to a model with only one scoop."
1,Did not make balls but long strips,I searched for this item on Amazon and read all the positive reviews and forgot to checkout.Ended up at Target over the weekend and bought. I was excited based on the reviews online.I had gotten a honeydew and was excited to try it out.Mine never made 'balls' but long strips and jagged lines.It seemed to be a waste of time and money since I could've done that myself with a regular spoon vs. buying a kitchen tool which will likely not be used again.Disappointing.
3,It's okay,"Yes, it is what I wanted but I expected it to work differently. It is kind of difficult to scoop out certain ingredients but I'm sure if i use it for what it is meant to be used for it will work nicely."
4,This melon baller changed my life!,"That's not technically true, but I do like it.I read some other reviews about how the double sided thing digs into wrists or something? I've never once had that problem. Maybe if you are trying to ball set concrete or some other extremely hard substance that could be an issue, but since melon is generally the softest substance known to man I cannot imagine a situation in which you would need to exert enough pressure that even if you decided to hold the baller with the unused end pressed against your writs arteries that there would be discomfort. Maybe I'm just good at holding things.Really, though, my wife uses it more than I do and she' never had a complaint. It's a melon baller. If you are unimpressed, maybe you should examine your melon balling expectations and see if you might be setting the bar a bit too high."
2,"Soft, mushy brit pop","Doo do do dooo. When luv breaks down. doo do doo do. I heard so much raving about this record, but it's got no balls. All hail the Bryan Adams of the UK!"
4,More Fables Goodness!!,"The third collection of Bill Willingham's Fables continues to impress. The art, especially by Mark Buckingham is fantastic and absoultely perfect for this series. The main tale, involving Snow, Bigby, & Goldilocks was great and the surrounding tales involving Jack and others in the Fables world didn't dissapoint. Really good stuff. I'm excited to read the next trade!!"
5,Bought as a gift,"Was in good shape, and assume it is well liked. I did not personally read the book. - - -"
4,fabulous fables,This series only got better and better. Love the Adversary story arc and issues that focus on Snow and Bigby.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"A story focusing on the ramifications of the attack on Snow White by Goldilocks, in the main.That main arc is bookended by two stand-alone issues, one of Jack Horner and his time from the civil war, and the last is Bigby Wolf recounting a story about little Fables and the quest for barleycorn girls.The important story involves, Goldilocks, Bluebeard, Prince Charming, who is proving himself a bit of a spymaster, and a plot to have Bigby and Snow killed.Quite good again, as Fables continues to be well done, particularly as the whole fair tale character thing is not something I am disposed to like in the main, but this urban transportation of these characters is good stuff.For Big Bad Wolf fans, there is some gold awaiting."
2,Not the best one out there--don't stand by their 200% guarantee,"The video tutorials are great. The program is average compared to others out there.My biggest peave is that, after trying a number of programs, I found one I liked better. Dan Oaks refunded only my purchase price--NOT THE 200% HE CLAIMS HE WILL DO. He continues to ignore my emails.Downside, they charge for modules and recipe book add-ons."
3,Great Read,"SO pleased that Shute's work is now available on Kindle.This is one of my favorite books by this author. An older Englishman is caught in France in WWII just as the Germans invade, and ends up rescuing several children while trying to get out. This is a tale of quiet actions, heroism through perseverance and endurance, not violent dramatics. This grandfather - as with so many of Shute's fabulous characters - does the amazing, while thinking that anyone else would do the same.Two things were especially noteworthy: First, an American author probably would have romaticized the children more. Secondly, I found the psychology employed by the Germans when dealing with the French citizens at the time of the invasion very interesting. It was an aspect I had never read before.Highly recommended."
3,Ordinary folks in unique situations... Good old Nevil Shute..,"I enjoyed this Nevil Shute novel about as well as I have all his other books I've read. I've read a majority of his novels, and these all have had rich and interesting characters. I enjoyed Pied Piper, and my personal favorite is Trustee From the Toolroom. If you're a reader and you haven't read any of his work, you owe it to yourself to dive right in. Other than an English idiom or two that may take a second or two to digest, I predict you'll enjoy Shute's stories, characters, and writing style."
5,Unforgettable!,"Nevil Shute wrote stories about regular people thrown into extraordinary circumstances. He doesn't seem to attract much attention in college literature classes, perhaps because he writes about ordinary people. It's a shame because every book of Shute's is a great read. His characters will remain with you long after you've read the book. This tale of a grieving father who became a true hero is one of his best."
4,A Respite from Sex and Gore,"A somewhat earlier Shute novel that again reveals his positive orientation toward people and life. Shares with many other novels the preposterous notion that some Nazis were humane and thoughtful (I'm thinking of Steinbeck's ""The Moon is Down"" for one), but I don't hold that against the work. We would all do exactly the same things the old man did to save the children, so there develops a great sympathy for him during the course of the reading. And the book is squeaky clean, one that provides some welcome relief from the current onslaught of, say, two females having sex in the toilet stall in ""Bright Lights, Big City."" We're way far away from that here. And thank goodness."
2,Good idea but bad execution,"This ring is supposedly designed so that you can wear it with the tag hanging down (as shown) or in the reverse with the tang hanging from the top. In the latter position, the tag is quite heavy and the slightest motion causes the ring to protrude up which stretches the hole a great deal and makes it very easy to snag or see through clothing. In the position pictured, the ring will not fit at all in any size piercing because the tag is actually curved and bows out. The barbell is not long enough to accommodate this curve and the tag will either pull the ring out or flip over so it is upside down. Certainly not worth 19.99 nor even 1.99."
3,Pretty good,This phone is very good for being a phone. But they should do better with their music and video Vcast. I know I could just bring a mp3 player around but it would be good to have everything all in one. I didn't want to have to pay like 1.99 for each song (off Vcast) so i bought the kit that was suppoesed to let it work. i have figured it out and I can get on songs now but it took me a couple of days to crack their code. Also another problem is that when i had my songs from cds on it and then dowloaded a vcast song... it froze my phone so that I had to turn it off take the chip out and clear all my songs off.So for being a phone it would be 5 stars but the media gets very tricky.
2,Do not buy this,"I used this piece for 5 months and now I DONT like it.. people just cannot hear me on the other end - the volume adjustments are a joke. The body is sleek and smooth. I dropped the phone once and the front screen has a big crack now.. The reception is not good. My husband has a sanyo phone and it works perfectly when my razor doesnt even catch the signal.. There is no ring+vibrate option, i miss that option.If you still want to buy it, buy a leather case and a blue tooth to compensate for the fragile body and bad volume and deal with the signal issues :)"
3,not bad... not good,"this phone has had a bizarre ringtone assignment problem since about 1 month after i purchased it. for months now, it will randomly decide to assign the wrong ringtones to the wrong contacts. then, without warning, the ringtones will stop working altogether... forcing me to redownload and assign them manually... constantly.this has driven me crazy. but i'm not going to lie... everything else about this phone is perfect. good reception, good size, good durability, nice features and a good setup. if it wasn't for everything else about this phone i would have pitched it months ago....that and the fact that every cell phone doesn't work to some extent, so i guess i'll live with this ringtone problem."
2,Regret,"PROs: 1000 Contacts, Photo and Video, Ringtone and picture ID.Cons: Photo quality is average. Call quality is below average. Phone becomes slow after months of use. Text messages sometimes refuse to send.Overall: I miss my nokia with the alarm clock that rings even when the phone is off. Huge regret getting this phone. What I like best is the Ringtone ID's. I know who is calling by the ringtone the phone plays."
1,I will never get another Motorola phone again...,"...even if they pay me... for the simple fact that I can't download my photos from this phone (V3m) using my USB cable or Bluetooth without addl software I have to pay for! The manufacturer must be really hurting for money to be milking its unsuspecting victims (like myself) this way. May they go out of business.Addendum: It's not Verizon; it's not Sprint (my carrier, the worst); it's Motorola who came up with such an evil design."
4,My half sucky half great phone report,Ok the first thing i want to say is this phone is cut and very slim of course but there are a few things i want to say that arent good about this phone.It freezes up when I am trying to get on the internetWhen I close the phone it cuts off and Sometimes when you try to download the music to the phone it doesnt connect.Now the good things.I hve to admit I am just a little bit clumsy and I have dropped this phone on the ground many many times before and there is not one mark on it.I have also dropped it in water many times too but it hasnt been actingup at all.I dont absolutely recomend this phone but its kinda cool for a kid.
5,Best Phone,"This is a great phone its sleel,slim,and good looking and it works great! So you should buy this phone."
1,"If I could give it a ZERO, I would!!","This is the worst phone I have ever owned...and I've had many. Sure, it's cute and light, but the phone is constantly dropping calls, gets TERRIBLE reception, decides not to ring when it feels like it and the battery life is about 36 hours with no talking and about 24 hours if you talk for about 1-2 hours (in battery save mode). I certainly would NOT recommend this phone to anyone. I had a Motorola before this which was absolutely wonderful, even after I dropped it in my dog's water dish! I thought this phone would be equally as great, but I'm very disappointed!! With my old phone I had perfect reception everywhere in my apartment, now I have to stand by the window and most times this phone won't ring in the apartment at all.The things that I do like over my old phone is the option to have true tones and it takes better pictures. Not worth it though! Think twice before buying this phone!"
2,Terrible customer service,A general warning about Verizon phones. The coverage is good but the customer service is the terrible. If you choose to do business with verizon get everything in writing and keep good records because they lie and cant find records until you find them and suddenly they magically appear in their records. This has happened to me several times.
1,No Good!,My battery can't hold a charge and my phone freezes up at least once a day and I have to either shut it off or disconnect the battery. It's no good and you should purchase something else.
3,hack it!,"Okay, there are a lot of annoying things about this phone, but the good thing is that if you are computer savvy you can easily hack it. Google hack razr v3m and you will see many good guides. For instance, i learned how to replace the mp3 that plays the ANNOYING power up/down verizon jingle with a BLANK MP3. That means, no interruptions when shutting of my phone (saves a lot of embarrasing moments at lectures or meetings). Also, DONT PAY TO DOWNLOAD RINGTONES. The simplist thing to do is replace an existing one you hate with one you want. Same is to be said for downloading music. Why pay twice to listen to music?! If you have a few hours you can figure out how to hack it.ps. do love the thin design. would have given it a 5 star but the phone does take a lot of time to hack and fix all the verizon junk."
3,its ok,"I've had the razr about 2 months now and I like the phone and the sleekness but I'm actually in search of a new phone because the battery life on this phone is terrible. I don't have full conversations on this phone but do use the texting feature often and this phone almost doesn't make a full day with me. I almost have to charge it every single night. So for someone who actually does talk on the phone alot, I would NOT suggest this phone at all. I refuse to buy a new battery because like I said, I've only had the phone about 2 months. The features of the phone are nice and plentiful, takes really good pictures. But battery life is awful and also the phone kind of pauses when you press a button, sometimes it takes a few seconds to actually get your contacts up or view your messages after you've pressed a button."
1,features disabled,"Verizon has disabled transferring files (wallpaper, ringtones etc.) to and from the phone, forcing you to pay extra for their services. If you want a full-featured razr, switch providers."
3,Verizon's User Interface Ruins This Phone!!!!,"Hi All,I first want to say I think the phone is a great phone, but I'm very unhappy with what Verizon has done to it. I assumed I would be getting another Motorola product with the same Motorola interface I've had for the last few years with my T720 and my V710. Unfortunately, Verizon has put their own user interface (VCAST) on all their phones in a blatant attempt to make the customer pay for pictures and tones. It really defeats the purpose of purchasing a Motorola product. If you think you are getting a Motorola phone with the traditional Motorola software you are sadly mistaken. At this point I'm so upset with Verizon that I plan to return the phone and switch to Cingular."
2,Tough to Hear,"My husband is on his third RAZR phone--the first one just stopped working after a while and the second died about a day after the warranty expired. The replacement was not free and required a contract extension. It's nice looking, small functions reasonably intuitively, and the bluetooth earpiece is nice, but it's a pretty fussy little thing. When I use it, I find I can't hear the caller it unless I have it positioned at just the right angle to my ear and I spend half the conversation looking for that sweet spot and asking people to repeat things. Also, some of the screen pixels seem to go sort of semi dead so that they look a bit greyed out at certain angles. For the price of this phone, I'm not very impressed."
2,"A good phone, but bad media device","I was hoping to use this as both a phone and as a MP3 player on my commute to and from work. While I like the design and functioning of the phone, I am very disappointed with it as a media device. I just destroyed a recently purchased 1gig Micro SD Card trying to remove it from the V3 slot. There is no way to get my music collection to and from my computer other than transfering this type card between my PC and the V3. The design and location of the Micro SD slot on the V3 is just awful. Any tool which can get a grip the card in the V3 to help remove it can also destroy the card."
3,The E815 was a much better phone,"If my E815 didn't have the restart problem when sending text messages I would have kept it. I sent it back twice for replacments and all 3 phones had the proble. It is very common and part of the reason VZW dropped it.The V3m is ok, but would be much better without the stupid VZW interface. The red bars across the top and bottom are annoying and the menus are not as user friendly as the Moto UI on the E815. It's all in what you're used to I guess. Verizon layers their UI over the moto OS to keep users from making the seem edits to enable features they don't want you using, unlike the E815 which was very easy to fix.I will live with it until my contract is up and go back to Cingular where they don't mess up a good thing. The V3i is a far superior phone."
1,So bad I had to change the phone,"I initially purchased this phone through Verizon: A brand new Razr. It looked nice, but the battery on the phone was worthless. Every night I had to recharge the phone. Even when I did not use the phone all day, I still had to charge the phone at night. Same thing happened after exchanging the battery. I tried three different batteries, but same result. Maybe I had a defective phone, but that did not matter to me. I simply exchanged the phone after seven days to another model. I would not get this phone if I were you. Hope this helped."
1,Motorola RAZR is a disappointment!,"I wanted the Motorola RAZR for a while and I finally got one. Now, I just wish I had my old phone back. Here's why I don't like this phone:- buttons on the side are easy to accidentally push- the standard ringtones are terrible and you must pay for any new ones- the battery doesn't stay charged for more than a couple of days- frequently used functions are not very easily accessedOverall, I had high expectations for this phone. I thought I was getting this high tech, cool new device and it's not even as good as the simple three-year old phone I was using!"
1,Total Failure,"This phone is a huge step down from the cheap old LG phone I got for free with my account ~3 years ago. Definitely avoid this phone entirely, or make sure that you get the updated software from a verizon store ASAP.Pros:- semi-slim profileCons:- 'slim' profile accomplished at expense of making phone wider another way- Glossy screen has massive glare and always appears dirty- Menu navigation requires many more button presses and extraneous submenues than my older phone for no apparent benefit- Annoying alerts for missed calls, messages, etc... will continue until you physically open the phone and respond to them- Software was only finalized about a month ago and requires that it be updated while physically connected to a Verizon store's computer- Phones have tendency toward battery and charger problems unless software is updated, as listed above- Poor reception and sound quality"
1,"If you want a quality phone, do not buy this one","I have had this phone for a week and was about to take it back due to the bad sound quality when the glass window on the outside of it broke. True, I dropped it, but it's amazing that one drop could shatter the window. I looked up this phenomenom on the internet and have found several postings about how fragile the glass is. One person said that it cracked when they pulled it out of their pocket. I had my previous phone for 3 years (not a razr) and dropped it accidentally several times, it did not break once. This phone is not worth the hype. The sound quality is not great and it's much too fragile for real people."
2,decent phone,"this phone is more design than functionality. the slim body fits easily in a pocket or purse, and the shape of the phone makes it easy to hold while walking or talking. its a trendy phone. good battery life and quality speaker/microphone make it an easy use.the cons:speakerphone isn't loud enough...but is it ever?navigating through the interface on this phone takes ages. i've gotten all four of the software updates and this problem still isn't fixed.the iTap quick type for text messaging is a little more difficult to learn than the t9 i've used previously on LG.overall, this is a decent phone, especially because verizon promotes it in free offers. i wouldn't pay a dime extra for it."
3,"Cool phone, great potential, vz is not so great about it","I got this phone from my parents for christmas. Over the past few months I have found some good things and some bad things about the v3m from vz wireless.Pros: Cool phone, very thin, sleek, great sound quality and I really like the razr's aluminumish keypad design.Cons: Verizon strips this phone to a bare minimum. Everything that you want extra costs, I thought that this phone worked as an mp3 player that is EASY to figure out, vz hates mac. I tried so many diferent things to get mac items on this phone and all of them failed.Summary (for those who didn't bother to read the above): cool looking phone, great potential, crapy features."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! This phone is a piece of crap!,When I first saw this phone I just had to have it. I loved that is was so slick and slim. No antenna was a nice plus as well. I really regret buying this phone!!! My biggest upset was the battery life. The day I recieved the phone I charged it and was ready to go. I made one THIRTEEN MIN phone call and it already needed to be charged. I went two or three days with the same thing happening and I finally took it back to the store. They(verizon) told me this was common with this phone and that I would have to buy a new and better $[...] battery. Needless to say I keep the one I had and it hasn't got any better. I only make 4 or 5 calls a day with no more than an hour usage and have to charge it twice a day. I dropped it(on carpet) and the display screen doesnt work anymore. The only upside to this phone is that its slender. I repeat Please Don't Waste Your Money!
3,"Lovely phone, poor reception","I love this phone: ideal form factor that slips easily into your pocket, great screen, lovely keyboard, works well with Bluetooth. Good set of features.HOWEVER, call quality is fair to poor (in Silicon Valley). I just converted from my $49 LG phone and was hoping for the marvelous Razr experience its owners carry on about. It turns out that when you press them on incoming call quality, they mostly admit that it really isn't that good.So if you're buying this phone with the expectation of using it a lot, then make sure you have a return option. As it is, with some reluctance, I will return mine before my 15-day return window at Verizon Wireless expires. It's a shame, as the rest of the phone is brilliant."
3,V3M The good the bad the ugly!,I upgraded to this phone. It has poor battery life on the battery that comes with the phone which is something like 700mah. I found that this did not work for me at all. On a full charge and no calls....it would be down to 1 bar. I took it back thinking it was a defect. Got a new phone and battery....same problem.....So I experimented and put the extended battery in. Charged on Tuesday night...turned on Wednesday morning and left it on thru Sunday where I found that I had still one bar and able to make or recieve calls. I just need to talk and listen...all the other stuff is not necessary for me! The extended battery by the way is 1450mAh or so! I am finding that different people are having different experiences with this phone! Good luck!
5,excellent,I've purchased two pair of these shoes...talk aobut great feeling...just be sure adn order the suede leather ones. They feel like a glove on your feet...a total blessing! Thanks for readingin ChristJeff
5,The must find of tenacious D singles.,"I was one of the few privliged people who got this single when it was released at records stores. It contains four tracks:1. Cave Intro demo (0:46)2. Jesus Ranch demo (2:14)3. Kyle Quit The Band demo (2:10)4. Exploivo (Mocean's Worker's Megamix) (5:02)This is a very short single, but Jesus Ranch is a classic staple of the Tenacious D band, and one of their most funny songs. It is worth tracking this down. This captures the original and fresh sound of D when they were funny, and not worn out. Worth the investment if you are a fan."
5,Sweet little item,"I bought this because I wanted a sturdy smaller type spatula. It is well made and is used a lot around my house. Good for cookies, brownies, oh for just about anything you want to use it for."
1,Nice steel,"Nice steel blade - should last a long time. Somewhat smaller than I anticiapted (usable part of the blade only about 1.5"" wide and 4"" long.)"
5,Awesome,"... I needed to buy an Intuos2 for my classes. I choose the 9x12 tablet. It took a while for me to get used to using the pen, but now I love it! I spend nearly 6 hours a day on the computer. Now I reach for the pen for nearly all my mouse-ing needs. It is much easier on soreness caused by repetitive stress. In addition is it much more precise. This tool is absolutely awesome! This item is a must have for anyone doing a lot of graphics work!"
5,GREAT!,"A wonderful inexpensive option for swimming for those with a sight problem. My son finally was able to see while in the swimming pool,for P.E. class. It's worth having a couple pairs."
4,Great Choice!,The ring looks great. My husband loves the quality. Our only issue was that the ring only came in one size.
4,Good for scrapbooking,These stickers were exactly what I expected. I wish they weren't so expensive; I was looking for a deal. But travel was hard to find for a while so I had to take what I could get. Background laminate is clear.
1,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a screensaver that has an ocean setting, with fish traveling to and fro. Sea kelp swaying, bubbles rising here and there. Maybe a jelly or squid scooting at an angle from corner to corner. Maybe a fish stopping to take a look at me. Maybe an ocean floor with a star or urchin moving about slowly. Maybe a rock outcropping with an anemone. But this program does not deliver any of that. It is a cheap ocean setting, with basically a blue shaded screen with a few sunshine rays streaming through, and several fish types traveling accross the screen both ways. No kelp, no bubbles, no random movements. No up, down or diagonal. Looks more like a shooting gallery where the ducks just travel along in a straight line one after the other, then roll over and go back to the other side. BORING! I feel ripped off. I am returnig this product to Amazon for any refund they will give. I don't want anyone thinking I felt this product was worth buying."
2,This isn't the one at Office Depot,"Jeff Carter said he bought this because he liked it when he saw it on display at Office Depot. I believe he is mistaken. I was just at an Office Depot and saw a beautiful aquarium screen saver. I asked what it was, and the clerk said it was from Microsoft Plus for Windows XP. I checked, and Microsoft Plus does include an aquarium screen saver."
5,The soundtrack to the apocalypse,"Godflesh were the most innovative band from their era, combining the dark, oppressive atmosphere of industrial with the intensity of grindcore, but with more complexity than standard grind. The drum machine adds to the bludgeoning, syncopated rhythms and there are some trippy, almost psychedelic effects thrown in. Although Godflesh would later incorporate techno/ambient-ish sounds in their music, this is their purest statement."
2,Sleazy swipes,"Overrated musical nihilists who basically just strip down the Ministry aesthetic and drag a minimal, anti-melodic, plodding vibration of attempted dread far past its interesting point."
4,More Burn than crash,"Pat Travers is one of the most underrated guitar players, singer/songwriters in the universe. While I feel his best work was to come...the first four tracks on this CD are great and well worth the purchase.His guitar riffs are varied and show alot of range without dragging on and on like so many axe men of that era. His rough, soulful vocal style fits like a glove.The foray into jazz/rockish keyboard compositions are but a slight detour from the real strengh of PT...guitar based hard rock!! Track 8 is laughable. Thank god he came to his senses and avoided that light wieght rubbish in future recordings.Check out his ""Blues Magnet"" and ""Halfway to Somewhere"" CD's...they are the real deal!!"
4,IN-SANITY!,"Despite the presence of a few keyboards on this CD, this album is a well-blended melting pot of rock, blues and jazz. Even reggae is covered here in the form of a cover version of Bob Marley's ""Is This Love?"" Yet the rock songs best define Travers' standing as a rock pioneer. Listen to ""Snortin' Whiskey"" and ""Your Love Can't Be Right"" and you will be converted permanently. An underrated yet accomplished artist..."
3,size is not right,Seems the size is not for kids. My 7M for a little girl is EUR 40 (adult female size?)-- they are even bigger than my feet .
3,Not as strong as expected,"I ordered 2 servers and the head of one of them was bent right out of the box. The neck of the server is relatively wide and thin and I was able to easily bend it back to normal position. Because of that, I can now imagine that the head may bend again in the future should it be subjected to pressure trying to scoop some sticky heavy pasta. I wanted to avoid plastic servers and this is what I fell into.It looks nice though and I will give it a shot and see if it withstands real life sticky pasta challenge or not. My gut feeling is that it will.. but who knows!"
5,Pefect Spegetetti spoon,I got the wholeOXO Good Grips 15-Piece Everyday Kitchen Tool Setand just added the steel spaghetti serve to finish on the set. The quality of OXO is wonderful and I love the way they fill in your hand.
4,Good illustrations,I like this book as there are many illustrations and after reading the book I had a deeper understanding of buttons. This is an informative book and I would encourage those who are interested in collecting buttons and those advance collecters to read it. Another book similiar to it and I would reccommend is Antique & Collectible Buttons : Identification and Values.
2,color photos,"It would have been great if the photos were in color, this is something that makes looking and finding the buttons so much easier. Having color photos adds a lot."
3,Button Collecting,"Although this book is considered ""the Bible"" on button collecting books, I was somewhat disappointed in it. There were very few color pictures, and the black and white photos were small. Somewhat cut and dry in text, but I've discovered that such books are hard to find, and this was the most extensive one I came across."
4,Most Interesting about Button Information,This book is nice to look for pictures and information if you are interested in buttons . I am very happy with my purchase of the book. I would recomend it for a reference book on buttons.
1,Black and white pictures??,Very unhappy with this book. Black and white pictues of buttons are not very useful in identification. It has a lot of information and very small print. Seriously considering returning it.
3,Button photos leave a lot to be desired,I was quite disappointed in the photos of this book...many of the details are missing. Wish they would have put a bit more effort into the reason one would buy this book.
5,One of my all-time faves,"As the most memorable books of my bookish childhood come available on Kindle, I am rereading them. From the perspective of my 70 plus years, Bob, Son of Battle is only improved. As a child I could not fully appreciate the story or the masterly telling of it. Then it seemed merely ""a pretty good dog story"". Now I see it as deserving of a permanent place among the classics of animal stories for all ages. This book is worth the read."
4,It's alright,I didn't enjoy it one bit but I might in the future so I'm keeping it. It didn't make much sence and it hardly had anything to do with dogs.
5,I remember it from my youth,"I live in Vermont. The adjoining forest contains an old grave marker which reads ""Bob, Son of Battle"". Anyone have an explanation?"
2,Disappointing Tool,"I have the same complaint about this spoon as the matching slotted spoon - too much handle, not enough bowl. The bulky handles belong on something with a larger bowl. They would look better and would be much more servicable. I threw them both in a drawer and will only use them as a last resort. Disappointing."
4,good dvd great on vhs tape,"I purchased this product from homespun years ago on vhs tape of course the tapes are damaged came out on dvd purchased and was disappointed in the loss of transfer of some information from vhs to dvd still is a great source of rock and roll, r and b, and some blues guitar from the 60-70's but greatly miss the information that was cut out still plenty of info to keep you busy for a while would have been a 5+ star dvd but as it is still a good buy."
2,Product does not mach at all with picture.,"The racquet is in good condition looks great, but the grip it is not the same as picture discribed. DISSATISFIED."
5,Great Racquet,My new racquet has been great so far.I haven't had any real problems hitting the sweet spot and it is very durable.
2,Have other sources at hand if using this book.,"Pro: Contains good graphs.Cons: Badly edited, if it was even edited to begin with. On the answer to question #3 of the Review Questions in pg. 32, it says the answer is E, claiming that when cross-elasticity of demand is positive, the goods are complements. If you look on pg. 28 where it explains Cross-Elasticity, it says ""If in the previous equation we get a positive number, it is safe to assume that the two goods are substitutes."" Ironically, I used the Cliffs Quick Review for Economics to sort this out."
2,This book is not good for a CLEP exam.,"I guess I shouldn't be complaining because I was attempting to pass the macroeconomics CLEP exam with the AP cliff notes book. The reason I was doing this is because I could not find a study guide for it. So if you are looking for a CLEP study guide don't get this book, I did pass with a 54 and I needed a 50, but it was pure luck."
2,Poorly done,"I bought this book as a sophomore in college to review the material I had learned in high school (got a 5). This book is poorly worded, ambiguous and repetitive in its definitions, and sometimes downright incorrect. Made an OK review, but stay away from it if you're learning econ for the first time."
3,"Good record, terrible Portuguese accent",I guess I would rate it 5 stars if it weren't for the really bad accent on Corcovado and So Danco Samba.For me it ruined a otherwise perfectly good record.
2,Not very cordial,"These are really tiny, not very impressive in real life, and not worth the price, IMHO"
4,does the job perfectly,the one and only book i had referred to for IELTS and it did not disappoint. Gave all the topics in nice and precise manner. Did very good on the exams and there were no surprises which was nice.
2,Disappointed,"Despite the bad review, I went ahead & bought this item - wondering if ppl who bought the same item were wrong ... however, I have received the book in a good condition, but no tapes, no CC no audio...The first part of the book about Listening exams & practice... & I'm wondering how will I practice???Do I recommend this book for others?? Maybe if they want to practice the Reading & writing parts ... but definitely not for listening..."
5,YOU deserve better than this!,"The Color of Pomegranates is one of the most beautiful films ever made, but Kino Video's now legendary poor DVD transfers mean that all of the colours merge into a slushy brown. there is heavy pixellation, too, another sign that the transfer was hurried and done cheaply. It is almost immoral that they should have the rights to release this film but it seems that they are not capable of taking this responsibility seriously. I love DVDs, but this makes me want to cry - not because I wasted my money (which I did) but because a work of art has been treated so badly. The VHS copy I own is of much higher quality. Do yourself a favour, save yourself some money and buy the VHS version. If you love this film, then write to contact@kino.com to complain - not that you will get a response."
3,Visually arresting but indecipherable.,"Viewers should not expect a movie that tells a story or portrays character interaction in any understandable way. The film consists of a series of almost interpretive dance-like scenes, tableaus of startling imagery, which convey mood or psychological states more than events or narrative. Some may find it tedious. Unlike any film you've ever seen."
5,Not a Movie in the Traditional Sense,"Don't expect plot, character development, and all the rest. I first saw this movie in college and was captivated by the way Paradzhanov used the film medium to ""convey"" (not tell, really) a story through a series of tableaux vivants. In fact, I was so captivated that I fell asleep about half-way into the movie. We had a lecture _after_ the movie by an Armenian professor explaining the imagery and motifs, but it would have helped to know all that _before_ the movie started, to have some kind of mental framework to help guide me through the movie. Still, the movie stands up to multiple viewings, and gets better as you remember things and can anticipate the development that there is. It's a successful experiment, but not one that has been successfully reproduced, that I know of.And incidentally Armenians are not Muslims. In fact, they were they first nation to accept Christianity, in 301."
5,1 of the Greatest Films Ever Made,"1 of the Greatest Films Ever Made, COLOR OF POMEGRANATE - SAYAT NOVA, appears on endless lists of Top 100 most important films of all time -- and is considered a masterpiece by filmmakers, film professors, film critics, film students, film historians and film legends such as Fellini, Godard and Antonioni. Therefore, the reviews by incompetent users, like the preceding one, matter not!Issue of animal cruelty is nonsense and only demonstrates the reviewer's illiteracy. Comprehensive review of Parajanov's COLOR OF POMEGRANATE (not ""pomegranates""), including the quality of DVD, VHS, various prints, alternative versions and the importance of this cinematic jewel, will be published at www.parajanov.com in 2004.http://www.parajanov.com"
1,REPULSIVE,VIEWERS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THIS FILM CONTAINS SCENES IN WHICH ANIMALS ARE SLAUGHTERED AND HURT.
2,Film as iconography,"There are films that seem bad at first but open up when seen a second or third time. This is not one of them. The first two times I saw this film, it seemed incredibly beautiful to me. My jaw probably fell open the first time I saw it. But the third time was too much. The film is so incredibly silly and pretentious I almost felt like laughing at some of the scenes. At times it almost seems like a Saturday-Night-Live parody of an art film, e.g. the scene of the monks noisily chomping on pomegranites. A talent for visual composition and an interesting sound track are just not enough to make a good film. Paradjanov had one idea in this film (""Hey, I'll tell a story with a series of ikons!"") and repeated it five hundred times. Even imagistically, there are many many far more impressive films than this one -- take Orson Welles' ""Othello"" as one underrated example. Among art films, there are A films, B films, and then there is this film."
5,Total whirlwind insanity!!!,"I got this when it came out back in '88 and it totally changed my musical perspective. I'd already heard Scum and the Peel Sessions 12"", but this album took legendary Brummie noise merchants Napalm Death to a whole new level of deranged, superfast grindcore mayhem!!! This is probably as extreme as Napalm got, and, if you approach with an open mind, much noisy fun can be had. The lyrics are also excellent, something which too often gets overlooked when talking about this band. If you're a curious metal/punk fan looking for your first dose of Napalm, Scum or the new album, Enemy Of The Music Business, are probably better places to start, but if you're a committed noise/grindcore fan, you must own this album - so stop messing about and add it to your cart! The ultimate grindcore record. CHUFFED!!!"
5,Perfect Remaster,"All I can say is if you are wanting this album, this remaster is the one to own. The sound on this remaster is cleaner and fuller then on the original pressing. The volume on this is also lower then on the original pressing if you can believe that. It also has bonus tracks included with this release so to be honest, this is the one to buy.As far as the music goes I'll say this. This is grindcore the way it was meant to be. True, there are other good grindcore bands out there, however; this album displays grindcore at it's absolute best.Buy It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,NAPALM WHAT ?,"THis CD is horrible, as all the others released by this band. THis manages to be a little worse than the others !"
5,oxo steel masher,"it's my first masher. however, it's fantastic in my opinion. i love oxo products. i've used it to mash potatoes and strawberries so far. (not together) i keep the skins on my potatoes so it's probably a little harder as the skins stick to the masher. but it works great and i'd recommend it."
5,AWESOME!!,Starfield is one of the best bands i've heard. Everyone will love this cd. It is a GREAT cd. I'm telling u now...this band will be BIG. They are great. Get the cd.
4,very good book,"This is a well-written true account of the Nebraska serial killer, John Joubert, who murdered three young boys in the early 1980's. The author did an excellent job of holding my interest in a morbid subject, I'll admit I'm hooked on true crime, but this is surprisingly good. Some tc books are dull dry, and boring but not this one. It's more like a fictional thriller but the sad fact is it's true. It was published in 1990, and I got on the 'net to see what happened to this innocent faced young man who harbored a horrible compulsion to mutilate children before he graduated to murder. It's been almost 20 years since he committed his gruesome crimes and I won't tell you the ending but I highly reccomend it to true crime buffs."
4,Who knows what evil lurks in the heart of man,"John Joubert was a pathetic sick little man. Thank God they caught him before he killed any more little boys than the two, possibly three that he admitted killing. Mark Pettit did a very good job telling this sad, scary story. According to Wikipedia Joubert was executed by the electric chair on July 17, 1996. He was 33 years old."
4,Good gift!,This book was a great gift for my sister-in-law! She loves the real-life crime dramas and this fit the bill perfectly!
5,Its About time!,"This is album is truly a blessing! In today's frenzied times, to have such a young dedicated child with an amazing voice sharing her inspiration couldnt be more needed. She is truly Young Gifted and Black in the same regard as the traditional young black songtress and not overly ""designed"" to fit some cookie cutter mold of sort-of talented singers that all look like they could be sisters. I hope to see and hear much more of this amazing child! Its amazing to see also that she has already worked with some of the greatest singers of all times!"
5,Najiyah is Hot!,My name is LaMia and I am a singer/songwriter. I definitely know talent when I hear or see it and Najiyah is BIG TALENT! I was watching Bobby Jones this morning and I tell ya Najiyah ministered to my soul through her songs. Najiyah's voice is amazing and will prove to be even more so as she grows. I want Najiyah to stay strong in gospel and never to turn her back on it because God has blessed her with a rare jewel. I have purchased the CD and cannot wait for it's arrival. I will also send a link to my online club and let everyone know about this young star! If you need any songs email me at lamiasings@yahoo.com.
5,It's Just Me,I had never listened to Gospel before Najiyah however I simply love the way this album sounds. It has the power to lift your mood in a way I never thought imaginable with music. I think her undisputed masterpiece is 'Through the Storm'.
1,Not really an OEM replacement as described,"The hoses were very nicely constructed, but they did not have the proper 'D' shaped connectors on the ends that attach to the front strut on my Porsche 964. They will go in the retainer, but fit is loose. Not a good thing for a brake line to be loose in its retainer. They were not a direct OEM replacement due to that fact.I am returning the hose for credit."
5,Interesting history you may not know.,"I have been a visitor to the Yosemite Valley on a regular basis for half a century. (Wow, that makes me feel old!) It has always been a place of enchantment, peacefulness, and breathtaking beauty for me. I remember laying out in the meadow watching the firefall in the early 60's (back before we were so environmentally aware of the damage it did to the meadows). I remember the feeding of the bears at the ""dump"" at the end of the valley (also before we realized the harm this caused). But there was much of the history I didn't realize.This book covers the plans for the Glacier Point tramway, the building of the Wawona Tunnel, Logging operations, the first automobile travel, stagecoach hold-ups, the tunnel trees and more! It was easy reading and had tons of great old photos. If you find yourself being drawn back to the Valley year after year I think you will find this book to be entertaining, charming and will give you the feel of ""knowing"" Yosemite even better."
3,"rated for the music, not for the overall DVD","First off, let me just say that the music on this DVD is absolutely wonderful. Russian Orthodox liturgical music is entirely a cappella, and is sublimely beautiful. That said, the video portion of this DVD outright (...). It looks like it was made off a bad VHS dubbed copy; the picture jumps, lines occasionally go across the screen, and actually the visuals of the singing are pretty cheesy. The choir lipsynchs pretty well though. When I put this one one, I just turn the TV off and listen to it, because the visual part is just so bad. I just hope someday someone actually shoots a DVD of a real orthodox service, because I have never seen anything so spiritually moving!"
4,Could listen to this forever !,"Let us get this out of the way -- so the DVD is not so great to watch - NOT that bad either.Now for the important message --the chants are wonderfully performed. You do not want to miss this music.If you don't enjoy viewing (which you may) just listen to it. I keep it on in the background in my home office as much as possible. I find it makes for a much better attitude when faced with deadlines and work overload.Now that I've heard the St. Petersburg Choir, I will definitely look for more of their music."
4,Lovely choral music,"This engaging performance features traditional songs of the most important holiday of the church year. There's only one aspect I didn't enjoy: the fog effect. It's on too much for my liking. Other than that, the voices are excellent and it's a perfect show for this time of year."
4,Good book for market indicators and history.,"This is a quick reading book that has an easy going narrative style. Olly covers the cycle of markets, and uses the indicators he witnessed in previous property slumps to justify his opinion on where are in the current cycle.He then proceeds to cover how different property types perform in a bust time, with recommendations on how to structure you finances at/before the cusp of the bust.The last part of the book describes how to make the most of the opportunities presented at the post-bust stage, and the difference between residential and commercial property performance."
5,Worth the money,"I found this product and then hesitated when considering the price. I finally broke down and bought it and I'm SO happy with it. It fits the hand well, does its job, and has such solid construction, it'll probably outlast ME! I've since purchased more Oxo utensils and have yet to be disappointed. Give it a try -- I promise you'll flip. (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)"
5,I can't believe how much I like this spatula,"It's strong, the handle is very comfortable, and it washes easily. This is actually my first metal spatula, I've live so long on plastic ones, and I really like the plastic ones I have, but this was a revelation. I have many other Oxo products because they are so well designed and made, and this is no exception."
5,Oxo SteeL Turner,Great product. Light weight and sturdy. This product is well made. I will definately purchase more products from them!
1,Thick handles,"Why do all the kitchen utensils Oxo makes have giant thick handles? I do not want to be holding huge handle while I am cooking, I want a nice thin handle so I can feel what I am doing. I do not have arthritis, I do not need help holding my cooking utensils! So. I am looking for a thin bladed, thin handled utensil and know I will not find it at Oxo."
5,Very good read,"Although I am sure that this book was written some time ago, it still tells a very interesting story of a person that just kind of disappeared into obscurity. He had an interesting life before his very distinguished army career. He also had one of the worst personal tragedies a person could have and still continue on."
1,...quite boring...,"I am a great Natalie fan. I found ""Ask a woman who know"" simply delicious...so this new album is quite surprysing to me as it is boring, dull....she still has a nice voice, but most of the songs don't catch the listener. At least, they didn't attrack my attention...with the exception of ""Day dreaming"" and ""The more you do it""......I hope next album is better than this.In the meantime, let's hope we get a new album from the greatest voice of all time... our dear Whitney nowadays seems to be ready to give us some hot material. She is in our prayers."
2,Natalie Cole Needs New Material,"I was disappointed and bored with this release. Although I love many of the songs, the versions I like aren't performed by Ms. Cole. Go back to your roots, Natalie. This didn't do it for me"
2,just kinda there,"Natalie Cole is Both a great Vocalist&very stunning looking lady,but this Album can't bring any life. the Problem is that Natalie cole has already done this Album 2-3 times already way better. now Natalie Cole is a Very underrated Artist&very versatile,but this sleepy time Album is just mainly polished Cashews&Wine Music for the background. I did like Natalie take on the Isley Brother's Don't say goodnight&Aretha Franklin's :""Day Dreamin"",but aside from that this album doesn't hold my attention. Natalie Cole has already done way better Cover Projects."
2,not so good,"I think that this album of Natalie is not so good; there are many songs that in their original versions (Criminal by Fiona Apple, If I ever lose my faith in you by Sting, Day dreaming by Aretha Frankin)were very good songs, while Natalie, in her interpretations, make them much more ""pop"" than they were before; ""pop"" in the sense that Natalie's interpretations are more commercial and easy.I don't like this album very much; the only song that I consider good is You gotta be."
3,"A classical text, but a shoddy book.","I ordered this book for Christmas and have not yet read it completely. The style is Victorian, but quite enjoyable if sometimes a little long winded. However for anyone who has sailed up the Nile or spent time in Thebes, Abu Simbal etc., it has a charm and acuteness of observation which will inevitably bring back memories and sharpen them in a pleasant and thought provoking fashion. The biggest disappointment of the book is the manner of its printing which has resulted in numerous spelling errors, horrible layout and no index. Perhaps this edition is better than never reading the book, but the complete absence of illustrations and maps (that are present in the original) together with the numerous errors cheapen it almost to the point where it is not worth buying. First, try to find an original edition, failing that, buy this version just to appreciate how much more balanced the Victorians were both as travelers and book publishers than we are today."
3,Enjoyable read of a woman's journey up the Nile,"The story starts out very interesting but gets bogged down a little later. I believe that the Amelia Peabody mysteries have used this Amelia as inspiration. Very good descriptions of the scenery, market places, the boat and her companions on their trip up the Nile river."
4,Historical reference,"I haven't actually read this all the way through. I got it because of its relationship to Amelia Peabody. I do plan to read it, but just not all at once. As expected for a book of its age, the language requires the reader to pay attention."
3,In the spirit of M.O.D.,"This album has the edge you would expect from this genre, and also some funny lyrics."
4,"Nice case, a little large","I had intended on putting my lens in this, then into my camera bag. It's too bulky to do that. It would be perfect if you are storing your lenses outside of a camera bag or for long periods. Very nicely made case, but if you're putting it into another bag, this won't work well unless you bag is huge."
2,Muddy and Mediocre,"The CD is a disappointment on two fronts. The recording quality itself is poor; muddy, distorted, inarticulate, sometimes distant, and poorly balanced. I'm sorry to sound so overwhelmingly negative, but the truth is that most of the CD sounds like it was recorded by an amateur with lousy equipment and needles pushing red all over the place. On the second front, the performances are inconsistent and far from inspirational. There is definitely some music worth hearing on this disc, but your Larry Young money is better spent elsewhere (""Unity"", for example)."
4,Maiko Yuuki Is Luminous,"This DVD offers clear proof why Maiko Yuuki is the number one AV star in Japan. Not only is she extremely pretty and charismatic, she is also very intelligent and approaches her work with a sense of fun and bright good humor. A viewer feels relaxed, lulled into her world of sensuality that's neither glossy nor pretentious. A very nice video. I hope more Maiko Yuuki videos will be released here in America."
1,Japanese bummer,"This is not exactly what a typical buyer would expect. True, there is nudity in the video, but it definitely is not worth the money. Granted she's a pretty girl, but don't expect any really explicit sexual material. If you are interested in pretty AND naked Japanese women you are most likely better off getting something else."
3,"Sad excuse for a ""Best Of"" album!","This thing was put out in Europe only by a record company that didn't own the rights to publish stuff off of all the albums. Pardon me for pointing out that the cover art was from the band's most embarrassing moment, and that you're missing out on anything from ""Hail to England"" or ""Into Glory Ride""... which includes most of the bands's biggest and most epic songs.Sure these songs are all good, but this compilation is just a few songs you should have already on the proper albums with the proper artwork.Manowar NOW volume 1and the hits just keep rolling...."
3,right case wrong movie,"this movie was ok because i love kung fu movies,but i use to own this movie and you put the wrong movie inside the case it has the same name but its a different movie jackie chan is not in this movie,ok movie though"
1,Far too expensive,"Each 'module' is only 30 minutes long, and a good part of each is eaten up by the opening and closing credits. Collectively, this is a good introduction to solving the simplest types of differential equations, and as such it would be worth 5 stars if all six modules were on one DVD."
4,How do such brilliant cd's go so overlooked?,"To be honest, I am not even quite sure how stumbled upon the name Sierra Swan, a night of wine and googling perhaps. I took a chance on the cd after hearing a few clips, I knew immediately it would be something I'd get into. First play and I am blown away. Her voice is powerful and demands attention, the vocal arrangements with harmonies are fantastic. The melodies are as if every song should be a single and I don't normally give a cd so much praise but wow, what a secret. It's ashame more people don't know about this artist. I'm not going to compare her to anybody because first listen...very original. Love it! Wow!"
2,Wanted to Love it,"I loved Sierra Swan when she would sing with Scooter Ward with such great songs like ""Suffocate"" and ""No One"" However this disc to me any way was dreadful it sounded like the bad modern pop instead of an original recording. It occurs to me that she was pushing for more radio play and relying on bad modern techniques and in order to do that I could not tell weather she was trying for Jessica Simpson or Celine Dion (OK maybe that is a little too far)sad really I had so many hopes however I still have a belief that her future releases may be more mature and although I disliked this album I gave it two stars for the fact the she is finally out there however tragically this falls short."
3,Different than expected,"Those of us familiar with the late 90's release by Dollshead -""Frozen Charlotte"",cannot help but be a bit surprised by the style of music on ""Ladyland"". Dollshead's ""Garbage(the band)-like"" style was a welcome alternative to the mainstream bands of the time. That said, this release is good, but more mainstream in that regard. Ms. Swan shows a great range of style and abilities in her performances here.However, I find the music/songwriting to be only slightly above average. I miss Dollshead."
5,What's an old dude like me know?,"All I can say is that this young woman's voice goes right through me. I caught a sound bite on one of the local channels one evening, followed up on the album and don't regret a dime spent. Cuddo's to you Sierra. Extremely talented, excellent lyrics and depth. I've worn out my CD if that's possible.Wonderful....."
4,Tom Sawyer detective,"This was not quite up to Mark Twane's other books about Tom and Huck, but it was lively and generally a good read"
4,Lovely!,"I had not read this since I was in grade school (many years ago) and I found it delightful! Mark Twain is a terrific writer, not only by the story itself but it provides a peak into that time and place. Great story for kids and a opening for parents to discuss the difference between those times and now."
2,poor grrammar for Mark Twain,"I'm sure regular readers of Mark Twain would also like this story, the wierd spelling of words and the story just bored me."
4,Great read and perspective,I'm always in awe how human perspectives can change over time. This book has helped me in providing a theoretical guideline to use in my dissertation. Thanks
4,Book,Book was in great condition when received. Took a little longer to get here but when emailed the customer service was awesome and super helpful! I will definitely order from them again!
4,Academically sensitive approach is thought-provoking,"Wolfe takes a very sensitive approach having put thought of the highest anthropological calibur into the meaning of this ethnography and the meanings of ethnographies as a whole. The author's focuses include systems of power differential, voice and inclusion. Everything Wolfe writes is put in perspective through culture and situation so as not to mislead or overstate. This approach can be sharply contrasted to that of Napoleon Chagnon in his work, The Yanomamo. Her feminist voice is refreshing and appropriate but struggling in a male dominated field. Very interesting ruminations and aproaches to a story. Author is not academically ignorant in the least."
2,Disappointing Tool,"The slotted spoon has a very large handle and a very small bowl, which make it too clunky to use as a serving spoon and too small to use as a cooking spoon. What were they thinking?"
5,As Good as All SteeL Utensils,"I've been rating all the SteeL utensils 5 stars as they work nice, feel substantial and comfortable and give me the impression they'll be around my kitchen for a long time. This spoon fits in with the rest of the tools I picked up."
5,Love it,"My husband and I purchased the slotted spoon and normal stainless steel serving spoons as replacements for our old ""chrome"" covered spoons which were peeling, and probably not too healthy. These get the job done, and most of all I like that they are stainless steel so I don't have to worry about transfer into our foods."
3,"OK book, but be careful.","This book offers sensible and common sense advice on how to improve your life by changing focus, habits and so on. It advocates among other things to start your own business and became the best employee. All very good and logical, but beware, some of the advice is not for everybody and may get you in trouble. Not everybody, for example, will do fine in a marketing or sales position, as a matter of fact if you don't have the right skill set it may get you fired.On the good and refreshing side, this one preaches and encourages hard work and dedication, it is no a get rich fast scheme,After finishing the book you realize that you probably knew most of what it discussed. It may spark your interest to try new things, which is good, very good, but remember to educate and inform yourself first, otherwise you may be sorry."
4,Real World Advice,"This book is a practical guide to making money, investing and managing your financial life. This is the perfect book for a new grad. Clear and straight forward advice on how to think about money, how to earn money (traditional job), how to create money (build a business) and how to make money work for you (investing). I highly recommend this book and believe it will give anyone a clear path to financial mastery and happiness."
1,Kicking in open doors,This book is full of nonsense and open doors that get kicked in. Robert is not telling anything new. All he is telling is some common sense knowlegde your 5 year old kid can come up with. And then he repeats that knowledge a couple of times in different wordings. I regret buying this book and waisting my time. If only I had read the negative comments :-( I actually don't believe Robert and his friends. If they made themselves rich it's probably by selling books like this one and recommending eachother on the covers of those books.
3,I heard it all before,Automatic Wealth is an okay book - but I have heard it all before. There is really nothing new under the sun when it comes to accumulating wealth; it is mostly just common sense strategies. A good book but nothing NEW or groundbreaking.
2,"'Automatic', 'Instant','Quick','Millions'???","what this is about ?. these books are coming with creative names to get your $$'s so that they can make $$$$$'s.I did not find anything new and special in this book and all is said by many people in the past.If you have read many books on 'Million' and know how to write, you can make a millions by writing books like this."
2,Great if it is the first book you'll read on the subject,This book does a great job of going over the basics---but so do most other books on the subject matter. Nothing new here.Beginners will love this book. More hype and nothing new for the rest of us.
1,unrealistic claims,"After reading this book I can only say that the author is selling something unreal , the figues he uses in the book are totally unrealistic . talking about 10 and 12 to 15 percent returns on investment , like they are the readers just for the taking .his advice reminds me of the old Steve Martin shtick on how to become a millionaire , Steve says "" O.k. first you get a million dollars then...""This is basically what the author is saying, This book has no real pracital advice , It is just another author getting rich telling everyone else how to.Very disappointing , I would not waste my money if i were you ."
2,Save your money,"I am searching for idea's a new direction. This book is another income vehicle for Masterson. Some of his idea's are good but he is saying the same thing everyone else is. I think he started off with a good outline and then just filled in the spaces ,the ETR information he sends out is similar. I couldn't wait to read it,then I had to force myself to finish it.I am sorry I paid for the book, go to the library and invest the money you save."
4,Wish I'd read it 20 years ago...,"This is a good, balanced view on how to become financially successful (i.e., able to retire without excessive financial worry) in 7 to 15 years. No BS: He talks about the steps to take, and doesn't BS the amount of hard work it will take. But Masterson does more or less give us the formula for REASONABLE financial success. You won't be disappointed."
1,More 'Think and Grow Rich' Foolishness,The author suggests such foolishness as 'flipping houses' and volunteering free overtime to get 'in' with your employer. The author is the only one getting rich from this mess.
4,It's not all about the money !,"This is a useful book for anyone who feels their finances need an overhaul ! It is pitched at people who may have a little money saved already so I found that slightly disillusioning as I was hoping for a bit of advice on the fastest was towards getting rid of the last of my debts ! That aside however, it has some good tips for when one finally has some money to save/invest ! The thing that I liked about it was the fact that the author focuses on the important things is life as well - family, relationships, leaving the world a better place than you found it etc ! He defines wealth as being rich in love and health as well as money ! The info on tax etc is U.S. specific so if you live outside the U.S. you will need another source for that info. All in all, well worth reading !"
1,"bad quality, or I'd be giving this 4 or 5 stars","The first one of these I bought stopped working the second time I used it. I had liked it so much when it was working that I exchanged the broken one for a new one. That one lasted a few weeks, at least, but soon died the same as the first.Maybe I got two lemons in a row, but I'm not taking another chance on this product."
1,Vacuum cleaner without wheels = USELESS,"DON'T BUY IT.This vacuum cleaner has plastic wheels held in place with JUST 2 molded plastic tabs. So even if 1 tab breaks, the wheels can no longer stay in place. On mine, 1 came off in 3 months, other in 2 more months of regular usage. So 5 months later, I have a light weight, bagless, powerful vacuum cleaner with NO WHEELS. $60 down the drain.I have no idea why they couldn't add more tabs, say 4, or a design a stronger mechanism for the wheels, given that the wheels experience all the rolling, twisting and dragging while in use. Seems like something designed by the finance department rather than the engineering department."
1,AVOID,"This vacuum is bagless. The filter gets clogged so that you have to remove the canister constantly, which is messy and gets dirt all over the place. The worst is having to clean the filter, which you have to do by hand and remove all the grime and dirt. It is inexpensive, but in the end I still have to throw it away and purchase a serious one."
2,Is this a vacuum or a small jet?,"This vacuum sucks, literally and figuratively. That is about all it has going for it. Both my wheels continually pop off while I am cleaning and it is a total bother. It is super loud (my ears ring after I turn it off). I am sure there is some permanent damage happening. Needles to say DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,What a nightmare!,"This was the first thing I ever bought after researching on the web and boy was I disappointed. The size and weight of this are nice but after one year both wheels have broken off and cannot be fixed. And the filter is one big pain in the neck! Every time you run the vacuum you have to clean out the filter and the most effective way I have found is to carefully pick out the lint with a toothpick which takes some time. My husband and I have a running joke whenever one of us is cleaning out the filter the other says oh thank goodness we don't have to deal with bags anymore-bags!- you put in, you replace- but you never have to sit there cleaning out filters filled with dust and lint with toothpicks every time! I can't wait to buy a vacuum with bags again! The price of these filters is also not delightful-between 10-15 dollars and should be replaced fairly often. I'm still surprised at the high ratings I found on this product."
2,Too much trouble and maintenance,"The filter is a royal pain, hard to find, and expensive. Blows away dust before you vacuum it. Super loud, you will need ear plugs while using it. Cord is so short, you will need an extension cord. It finally broke, but I'm unsure as to what broke - it simply stopped functioning. Don't believe the positive reviews; this is a bad design."
1,Don't buy it for bare floors.,"If you need a vacuum to use both on carpet AND hardwoods don't buy this vacuum! It does ok on carpet but it has ( in my opinion ) a major design flaw....that the exhaust blows directly out the lower front of the vacuum. It blows the dust, dirt and hair into the air before you can vacuum it up. It actually blew my granddaughters pictures off the fridge! You vacuum one side and when you go to the other side it blows the dirt and hair back onto the side you just vacuumed! When I was finished I had to wipe down every surface in my kitchen ,including my stove, because there was hair and dirt all over it. More work. No thanks. Back it goes."
2,good for a couple of months,"I had to return my first one in about 2 months because it stopped doing its job. Since it was under manufactors warrenty, I got a new one - identical. About 7 or so months later, the motor broke. This was under an extended warranty and was replaced with another make and model.Pros - it is not very expensive and works well for awhile.Cons - Dont plan on keeping it long!"
4,good little vacuum,"I would give 4 stars if i could.It works fine, sucks like crazy!I must empty the dirt cup after each use andbang out the filter. There is no need to go crazycleaning the filter. It will be messy two secs after youturn it on again.The attachments work well. the only gripe i have is the attachmentsattach to the unit so low its very difficult to use them foranything at eye level or above. Ive tried putting the uniton a chair to raise it but this scares me as an accident waiting to happen but otherwise a fine purchase. And ive had it several months and it still works well."
1,You get what you pay for!!,"This is a cute Vacuum, and that's about it. The filter clogs, and they are next to impossible to find. The Canister is a pain to empty. The biggest problem I found was there was no height adjustment. If you have thick carpet, you just need to forget about this vacuum. What A nightmare to push and pull this stupid thing. Mine has gone to Goodwill."
3,Great Suction ... with some Problems!,"I bought it today and put it together in 5 minutes. It has fantastic suction with pretty high noise to go with it. It cleaned my oriental carpets and hardwood floors beautifully. When I got to a piece of new carpet with lots of lint, the light came on indicating a jam ... and when I emptied the dust cup, I noticed the filter was totally jammed with lint, and it's not a quick or easy task to clean it. I finally settled on a letter opener for prying the lint out of the filter grooves. I had to clean the filter three more times, but completed all the floors and they looked great.I had most of the same problems as everyone else: the hose kept popping loose from its storage position, the powerful front exhaust blew dust and lint away before the vacuum could get to it, and the hose is short and there's no extension. Mine hasn't stopped from over-heating yet, but I won't be surprised if it does.After one day of use, I plan to keep it and its problems."
2,it blows your dust first,"I seriously hope this is the review that sends this vacuum back to the drawing board. I saw some other post about the exhaust blowing debris in front of the vacuum but OMG!!! I live in NYC, I admit that I have dust bunnies, they love to hang out in the corners. When I approach them the exhaust from the vacuum creates a nice little whirlwind right before I get to them and causes them to blow up into the air.Terrible design really! Eureka and potential buyers. this Vacuum would be a 5 star success but the dumb position of the exhaust destroys any hope. not sure if this vacuum sucks more or just blows."
1,Completely lost suction,"I bought this vacuum about a year ago and at first it worked pretty well. Not a lot of power, but it was small, and I have a small place, so I was willing to deal. However, after the first couple of months, the vacuum began to gradually become less effective at picking up dirt off the hard wood and tile floors, to the point that, a year later, it barely picks up anything at all. It mostly just moves dirt around. I am in the market for a new vacuum, and it will NOT be another Eureka Optima."
5,Amazing Little Vacuum for the Money - A real Sucker,"I owned an Oreck Hepa filter vacuum and this little $60.00 gizmo. With 5 cats in the house, I had to find a way to suck up cat fur and dust bunnies. Well let me tell you, this little guy is amazing.I have a cleaning lady and she didn't believe me--one use and she became a believe and has recommended it to her clients as well. The vacuum is light, stylish and really works.For all of it's downfalls (hair and dust getting caught around the filter at the top and the air that blows out the front) the vacuum is a gem.It is cheap enough that if it busts, I'll replace it with the same thing.I love it! It works great!"
1,Terrible quality!,"I bought this vacuum cleaner (not from Amazon) about 2+ weeks ago and it just died on me. The motor went bust for no reason in particular. I was in the middle of vacuuming my carpet and it just died. I hardly even got to use it 5 times since I bought it.I had read the other reviews that it's got poor build quality and was prone to breakdowns etc but I was reluctant to believe them. I guess I learned the hard way. Avoid buying this vacuum cleaner if you can. For the price I paid, I deserve far better quality than what I got, and you should too.Needless to say, I'm absolutely disappointed and would not recommend this product to anyone."
2,Works great until the wheels fall off....,"This vacuum works great until the plastic molded wheels fall off. The wheel design is poor (cheap), and after less than a year of normal use on my vacuum a wheel came off. Unfortunately once this happens you are done.Due to this design flaw I don't recommend this vacuum unless you plan to buy a new one each year."
1,major design flaw,"This vacuum has a major design flaw in that the exhaust vent is in the front, which blows all the dirt or hair away from the vacuum! This is a huge problem with hard floors. I get my cardio excersize in while vacuuming, trying to outrun the dust bunnies, only to be stopped dead by the too short cord!I must say the suction is great & it's wonderful on rugs or carpet, but useless on hard floors."
1,MAJOR problems,"This vacuum has 2 MAJOR problems:1. The cord is far too short! I can't even vacuum my average sized bedroom without switching to another wall plug. I could probably live with this, given the great suction, BUT,2. This thing blows dust bunnies in the air before you can get to them! We have a corner of our bedroom where dust bunnies like to live, and they were flying in the air as I tried to suck them up! Now I have to get out my dusting supplies and clean all the junk that landed on my dresser.I pictured myself like a warrior, holding the vacuum over my head, sucking dust and cat hair out of the air, and quickly returned this monster for a refund. I guess it would be fine for carpets, but beware if you have hardwoods or tile - you'll be online for either an air cleaner or allergy meds."
1,Burns out motors if filter isn't changed OFTEN.,"I would NEVER buy another one of these again. The first one they shipped died in less than a week. The $10 filters that you HAVE to change every 3-4 times you use it can't be cleaned. You must buy them which means you will spend $10 every few times you want to vacuum. I have all hard wood floors accept for a few area rugs. We have one cat, one kid and a wood stove. We don't make huge messes. I wish I could post a video of this crappy vacuum NOT being able to pick up a Cheerio because you'd laugh!. I'm writing this review because I just changed the filter on the replacement they sent and and tried cleaning some sawdust from around the wood stove and the motor died AGAIN.I really wanted a Regina Carpet Sweeper but they don't make them anymore. :o(DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!"
2,Only okay,I bought this vacuum about a year ago - it was on sale for under $30 and it is not worth much over that. The filter needs to be changed every few times using it (even after cleaning it out!) and the new filters are over $10 each!The suction is only okay. The machine is LOUD! and dust comes out of it from day one.I recommend looking elsewhere for a vacuum.
2,Can't Recommend,"If I had only used this vacuum once, I would concluded that it was incredible because of the great suction and effective cleaning. It's lightweight, which makes vacuuming stairs super easy.However, there are some major problems with it:1. Short cord--be prepared to plug and unplug multiple times.2. Expensive filter that clogs with each use. Had to vacuum the filter with my old vacuum to extend the filter's use.3. Messy to empty the canister. Will never buy a bagless vacuum again.4. Cheap construction. The plastic wheel snapped off and can't be replaced, so after just three years of use, this vacuum is no longer usable."
4,great buy,I gave this as a gift and my aunt raves about how easy it is to use and how helpful it is for her housework
5,Great Vacuum!,"I bought this vacuum to replace a full size vacuum. I never thought it would work so well! I have all hardwood floors and 3 dogs, so obviously its important to have a great vacuum to get all the dog hair, and this one works perfectly! Its lightweight, and smaller than I expected, but in my opinion, it is every bit the vacuum that a full size one is. The only complaints I have, is the cord is rather short. I definately would purchase another one!"
1,The wheels came off,"This vacuum is a lightweight vacuum that functions reasonably well for almost a year. After a year of normal use of my vacuum, the wheels came off. The wheel design is poor. I don't recommend this vacuum unless you plan to buy a new one in a year."
4,good product,"good product for the money, got this item in 3 days, the only thing thats bad about this vacuum is that the wheels are too small, its kinda heavy to push around in thick carpet."
5,Must have item!,"I happened across one of these in a kitchen gadget shop a couple of years ago and love it! It is the best invention ever to get off twist caps from beer and wine coolers without tearing up your hands or having to use a towel. My macho husband even liked it. In fact it wasn't until this year when I was buying some as gifts that I realized it doubles as a bottle stopper...now it's even more awesome! Buy more than one, you will wish you had!"
4,A splendid revival of a great series,"This newly released compilation shows exactly how One Piece should have been shown. Near it original source as possible.For veterans of the series, it a lovely chance to see this great anime once again in it's original form. For newcomers to the series, it's a great way to be introduced to One Piece in it's original form.This DVD the first 2 story arcs of One Piece, plus half of the Captain Kuro arc. It's enough to quench your thirst for the lovely series i think.It also contains Dual Tracks for those who can't stand to read subtitles and those who absolutely adore them. It's all for you!Worth every penny!"
4,Manga is Better,"I've loved the One Piece manga ever since I started reading it. It was funny, light and amused me to no end. The cartoony artwork actually went well with the characters, how they acted and the whole tone of the story.The anime, well, not so much. The pink haired little cabin boy who wants to be in the navy, well, in the manga he was funny. In the anime, I wished, repeatedly, that he would just die. The anime annoyed me. Glad it is uncut, but I don't know if I'll buy much more of the anime."
1,uncut isnt all that,personally i don't see what's so great about uncut i bought the original version and it worked just fine. uncut is just the same thing only more expensive.
1,Think for yourself,"This is one of the best comics I have read in a while and the anime is faithful. Great characters, goofy plot lines, and great animation. Everyone has a great back story and One Piece can be very touching and inspiring but its mostly good fun, though not always clean. Anyone who cares to read will see that both the comic and anime are for teens though the story is generally light hearted. I can't recommend this piece of art enough to fans of action adventure stories in the vein of Dragon Ball. Much inspiration for One Piece is credited to Akira Toriyama by Eiichiro Oda himself. I only give it one star because today is opposite day."
1,Gift for my daughter,"I purchased this item for my daughter who is evidently addicted to Japanese cartoons. She seems to love it however I don't get it. Bad language, not suitable for children as far as I'm concerned."
5,This is the beginning of a legend.,"This is where it all stars. Season One, First Voyage (Uncut) of One Piece. The beginning of the end of human beings ever going outside. This is where it's at.How to get? Buy. Right now. Just click the button.You won't regret, you won't be sorry. This is the best thing that will ever happen to you.You will fall in love with Odas' characters, his imagination, his creativity and long-lasting humor.Don't think, just buy."
5,"Strange, Addictive, Exciting","That is how i would describe this cd. I don't know a lot about music, i know what i like. I bought this just to see what the fuss was about. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it. I thought i would listen to it once and then put it away. I have had it for 5 days now and i play the whole cd atleast twice a day. I can't get these great songs, with great lyrics out of my head. The lyrics go through my head all day long, it's disturbing. And i also sing the songs to myself while i'm walking down the street when knowone is around. I even try to sing some of nico's songs. When i'm away from the house i can't wait to get home and play my favorite songs. Great, great."
2,"nothing new, waste of money","i love the original cd but the second cd is the same than the first,should be like Loaded (fourth lp of Velvets) in his version "" fully loaded edition"" two disc with alternate and different versions of the same songs"
3,It was okay,"It was okay, but nothing was great. It was like a baseball team with a 500 record. Okay but not great."
2,Blew Me Away,"You can read all the reviews you want to about this album; for me, anything with the Velvets boils down to feelings. I was 19 in 1971 when I heard this album for the first time, and it simply blew me away. I was into what I thought for the time ""alternative"" music: Doors, Iggy, MC5; and then out of the mainstream stuff: Blind Faith after Cream, Spooky Tooth, Jimi. When I heard this album for this time, it was like the gods slapping me out of a trance. I couldn't believe, that in the age of dysfunctional and psychedelic love, a band had the guts to write and play brilliant music about the decadent side of life. How does an album affect you? Does it kick you in the stomach and force you to see things in a different way? Does it make you reflect and reorganize? That's what this album did to me. Lou and the Velvets may have influenced the last 30 years of rock's punk, alternative, and whatever else. All I know is that they influenced me. And that's much more powerful."
4,"Great album, overused Bang and Olufson production technique.","The recording and production is fantastic but its time to move on from this sound.These ""teen idol"" pop rock 'n' roll songs will last forever in music though."
5,Finally got it on CD,"I finally got it on CD after all these years. I love this album, when I had it on vinyl I went through three copies. I think this is the VU's best album,although they are all good. Lou and Nico sound great on the vocals and Lou wrote some of his best songs on this album. For me this is where Rock n Roll begins."
5,The greates rock album ever,"If you think you're cool at all, you have to know every word on this album. The velevets are the coolest band ever, and they happened to have written some of the greatest music of all time, in any genre. Punk began here, and good rock and roll wouldn't exist without Lou Reed's drug/kinky sex ballads, the Velevet Underground are one of the greatest bands ever, arguably, but this is most definitely the greatest album of all time."
5,"So beutiful, so uncompromizing","Just listen to it! It is so great. One might believe that it was all about making as much noise as possible, or making the music sound as ""weird"" as possible, or just about trying to create something that no-one had done before. This is not true. The real goal was to make every song as good as possible, as perfect as possible, to create a wall of sound that just sweapt you away. Don't let the distortion and feedback hold up your mind (if you like to do that, listen to White light/White heat), just appritiate how perfect every melody and every guitarlick is. Run run run is perhaps the best of all. It brings the orignal rock sound, deeply rooted, with the modern monoutony, the intelligence and humour. Sheer joy, folks."
5,The most influential recording ever made?,"If you haven't heard this CD, you absolutely must, because this is where it all started. There isn't a punk, alternative, industrial, new wave or experimental band in the last 30 years that hasn't been touched in some way by this album. A timeless mix of drugs, R&B rhythms, insanity, viola, drones, folk, feedback, pop and Greenwich Village poetry viewed through the lens of the New York art scene of the late 60's. Rife with references to heroin, war, love and death, this album has it all, and every song has become an underground classic. No rock lyrics written since have begun to cover the ground traveled by Lou Reed in these 45 minutes of sonic sacredness and profanity."
4,Good but Very Dark,"This album has Lou Reed's great lyrics and also great music, which I appreciate. But at times it can be very dark. I liked it overall and found the selection of music to be quite varied over the entire course of the album. I bought it because it is listed as one Amazon.com's essential alternative albums, but the sound it has is not very similar to many other alternative albums. In many ways it just sounds older, more like the classic rock of the 60's and 70's than the alternative rock of Nirvana and the ilk. That is not a complaint though and overall it's a very good album."
3,A bit of a kick in the face to a lot of fans,"This is a rather difficult product to rate, The Velvet Underground & Nico is with out question one of the most influential albums in rock history; It has also become a personal favorite of mine and the availability of the mono mix as a stand alone release would be great news...eight years ago when the deluxe edition was released. Yes this is the second disc of that edition for considerably less, so more than a little frustrating for many. However for new fans this is a great starting point, the rare mono mix is a great, gritty and energetic experience. Ultimately the music is phenomenal and as I said for those that don't have the deluxe edition this is a welcome essential release."
5,Save yourself some money and just get the box set.,"I woludn't even bother buying any of the seperate reissues. Just get the box set, ""Peel Slowly and See"". The great set includes all of the original lp's plus lots of bonus stuff. Their entire recorded legacy is damn near flawless. Trust me on this one, you'll end up buying all of their stuff anyway, might as well get it all in one shot. Get the box set, then get the two 1969 live recordings, and then, if you still need some more Velvets get the Robert Quine three CD set (which sonically is not as good as the 1969 recordings, but the performances are outstanding. So there you go, first the box set, then the two live 1969 cd's, and then the Robert Quine box set. The Velvet's were probably the most interesting, influential, under appreciated, underrated, and innovative bands of the 20th century. All good pop music, rock and roll, indie rock, art rock, punk rock, alternative has it's roots here."
5,Just...Yeah.,"You need this record. You will like it. I cannot imagine anyone not liking it. This record totally revolutionized the music industry. It was light years ahead of it's time and there really isn't anything like it, even today. There isn't a song on here I don't love and that's very very rare. Buy it, listen to it, love it."
5,THE MASTERPIECE,"This album show all the bases of Rock and Pop music. ESSENTIAL. Great attitude in making music as simple as it can be. Don't expect too much melody. Here you'll find experimental sounds to construct a Rock or Pop song. John Cale gives the experimental parts, Lou Reed gives the superb lyrics and the Pop touch. This is only the BEST debut album EVER. This is a MASTERPIECE, unrrated, brilliant... Let this thing GROW on you, and you'll find the purest of Art! -Seriously!"
5,Bananas in leather jackets,"In their latest album, the Australian super band Bananas in Pjamas have grown up quite a lot. Rather than songs about cleaning their teeth and coming down the stairs, they are now going up the street for drugs. It is nice that they still let the three bears & Ratty sing with them, even if Morgan (the girl bear, for those over 10) is tone deaf. The songs arent as bright and cheerful as their earlier work, but their devoted fans can surely look forward to following their development."
5,Where All Good Rock And Roll Begins,"'Venus In Furs' defines rock and roll. It is the perfect song and yet so is 'Waiting For the Man' and 'All Tomorrows Parties' and 'Heroin' and every song on the album. They should teach this stuff in school. 12 songs and that's all you ever need. You could toss out all your other CDs and just keep this one because it simply does not get any better than this. Off course you may as well buy the other three (White Light/White Heat, The Velvet Underground, and Loaded) and totally overdose on perfection. All homes should have a copy!! If you don't, buy it now, you'll love it."
4,"""Going for the kingdom in mono""","The VU & Nico reissue in mono is a very cool listen. This also contains some rare single edits of ""Sunday Morning"" & ""All Tomorrows Parties"". This mix seems have a beefer bass & very cool sounding echo on the vocals. The mono comes across as more raw & in your face v the stereo counterpart due to the sparce instrumentation used by the VU. I have the LP in stereo & that is ok too. This version seems to rock & really compliments the VU like many of your favorite garage singles do. I have been on a bit of a mono kick lately & so far have not been disapointed. Only 4 stars as this version would be for mono freaks or ""completists"" only but this is a 5 star release all the way. This is also available on vinyl as well."
1,"This is it, folks...","This is truly the most overrated album of all time. Nevermind? Ten? Dark Side of the Moon? The Wall? Wish You Were Here? Sgt. Pepper's? Machine Head? Images and Words? Wishmaster? Lift Yr. Skinny Fists? OK Computer? Disintigration? The Downward Spiral? RATM? Nevermind the Bollocks? Anything by Minor Threat? Reign in Blood? Ace of Spades? Evanescence's worthless Fallen? Hell no. This is the king, always and forever."
2,It was good in its day....It does sound dated now,This was a classic in its day. Listning to this album in 2005 is truly painfull..it's almost 40 years old. You do the rest of the math.....
5,truly alternative,I wish to add that this band is a truly alternative rock group. this overused term does not apply to the pop bands of today that loosely call themselves alternative. Green day and offsrping are not alternative. the Velvet underground define what is meant but alternative rock.
5,The Summit of the Rock Art On The Edge,"Before they met Andy Warhol in 1965, Velvet Underground has been ready. Poet Lou Reed far from the dominant order on his own, his rhythmic partners Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker and even avant-garde artist John Cale. In 1965, Velvet Underground met Andy Warhol in his mixed media show, Exploding Plastic Inevitable. This album is commonly known as 'Banana Ablum' and combination of the artist who has his own talent and desire."
5,Last words. No comment. LISTEN!,"This album does not require any more words, because no one will be able to describe it. It is a caleidoscope of music. It is the ONE for the island. Just go, buy and LISTEN."
3,For all Aspiring Sado-Masochists out there..this is for you.,"Yep..I bought, and was ""corrupted"" by it way, way back. Hard to believe that one album could contain such beauty,and such ugliness all at once. I still spin ""Tomorrow's Parties"", which could be a gypsy anthem. ""Femme Fatale"", and ""I'll be your mirror"", along with ""Sunday Morning"", are the other low-voltage ditties here,and all interesting in a quiet, though bizarre way, the latter being the Warhol/Underground tradement. ""Venus in Furs"" is based after a novel by the fellow who gave his name to the word ""Masochism""...The other efforts,especially ""Death Angel"" and ""European Son"" are the result of some post adolescents trying to shock their younger peers.Very Bad. Same with ""Heroin"". The album could be better titled ""The Beautiful and Damned"", but that was already used! No wonder the Boomer's parents did not always appreciate their kids' music!!"
5,In a Dreamworld,"This is one of the greatest recordings of the last half-century. Even though the Velvet Underground weren't great soloists, they managed to create lush, beautiful, dreamy songs. There is a Beatles-like quality to their songs, but the VU's music is much darker and more hypnotic. These guys sound like they are in a dreamworld; they must've consumed massive amounts of drugs and alcohol while making this album. My personal favorite tracks on the album are ""Sunday Morning,"" ""Femme Fatale"" and ""Run Run Run."" The last song, ""European Son,"" is extremely irritating and I rarely listen to it. So, I'd give this album 4.5 stars if I could. Anyway, anyone who enjoys classic rock shouldn't live without this album."
2,Vinyl was not yellow as promised,"While everything else was fine, the album did not come in the yellow vinyl as the description said. I paid a few extra bucks for it that I could have saved if I bought just the regular vinyl, which is what I received."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS REISSUE,"This is a terrible reissue of one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Instead of messing around with why the album itself is good or bad, I will just go right in to why the REISSUE is anything but essential.The reissue starts with the album in stereo. After that, there are a few NICO solo tracks. NICO is great, and I love NICO, but her work needs to be appriciated on its own. This would be like reissuing an album by the Who and adding Pete Townsend solo tracks.After the NICO tracks, the Mono Singles begin. After the mono singles, the mono album composes the second disc. Listening to the album in mono is kind of neat, but why put the singles on there if they are already on the album in the mono mix.In the end this is a waste of time and money. Rather than spend thirty dollars on this pitiful two disc set, I would suggest buying the original version of the album and a NICO album. This would cost roughly the Same amount of money but more worth the listeners while."
1,"Sorry, I just don't get it","I know this is going to be heresy. I first heard this band's record over thirty years ago. The rock press was fallin' all over themselves with praise about how important this band was. They were mentioned in the same sense as the Beatles, Stones, Byrds .ect as major rock influences. I bought this album in the mid sixties, I listened many times, trying to like it and wondering what I was missing. Most garage bands I knew could play and make up better songs. The songs are one or two cords (oK sometimes three), the singers drone on and on, I'm never sure what they are going on about and the whole thing was recorded in a substandart fashion, which makes it unlistenable. I was recently making a late sixties mix and bought the album, I am leaving them off! Sorry, not the Beatles, not even the Iron Butterfly or even Blue Cheer.. Skip this one, if you want a better picture of the sixties and it's wierdness, get the Nuggets box set instead: Relics From the Psychedelic Era.."
1,One of the most over-rated rock albums of all time,"Lou Reed can't sing, or play, and if you combine that with a penchant for writing songs that are unpleasant to listen to, then you can call it avante garde , and it can somehow justify this foursome of nobodies having a record deal when many other bands with talent went hungry. Influential? You bet. Punk rock would not exist without this album. Interesting? Sure. It's different; that's for sure. Fun to listen to? Only if your tastes run the gamut from the frog-voiced fashion model Nico to the psycho rantings of Lou Reed about Heroin, sadomasochism, and other ""fun"" topics. John Cale's violin screeches offer the final proof that this is one album you cannot listen to for pleasure.If you like this album, you deserve it."
5,viaje la centro de la VELVET,"completa y recomendable edicion, reune en 5 maravillosos discos el legado de esta particular banda, con sus joyas, su basura, sus momentos increibles y su desechable monotonia...el primer cd reune demos que no dejan de ser una curiosidad ,aunque realmente son ensayos y divagues inconclusos...su valor historico es notable. los demas cd nos llevan de la mano a las cañerias del new york que nunca conoceremos...en fin , un producto altamente recomendable.BUY IT!"
2,I don't like it.,"I've listened to this album repeatedly, and I just don't like it. Why should I settle for a band with very little musical talent? There are so many other bands that have good songwriting AND talent to spare that I don't see the point of dripping praise upon Andy Warhol.I wonder if anybody has ever compared Velvet Underground to Phish. I think this comparison perfectly demonstrates the difference between bands with opposite levels of talent. Both have the appeal of a band that never made a deliberate effort to become popular.I realize that a lot of people really like this album, but I think it's completely ridiculous to call it the best album ever. Do you realize what sort of competition is out there? If this tops everything that Led Zeppelin (or a hundred other good bands) ever did, then I must just be crazy."
5,the greatest band in music history.,the words velvet underground are very importand to me. these albums are priceless. one classic after another. you get all four of there studio albums plus an album of demos plus an excellant detained book on the most important band in music history. i can't even explain. just listen to the live version of what goes on. it makes the hair on my neck raise.
5,the greatest box set ever..,"i've owned this set about three times for one reason or another. i always come back to it, though because it holds up well. it actually holds up better than most of the music that came out of that hippie era because the experimentation was way ahead of its time. i also like the way the avant garde blends with pop melody, to make it more accessible in some way..this music really is not as hard, as say Ornette Coleman is to fully digest. you just have to have an ear for it..beleive me, the rewards come in great dividends for sticking with this music."
5,The best music you've never heard.,"The Velvet Underground are that band from the late 60's that few people have ever heard--at least directly. While they never achieved great popularity (this box set has sold more than all their albums have sold combined), the Velvets influenced music like NO other artists ever have. Their music has been so subsumed into the sound of modern rock music that their great originality hardly seems that astonishing anymore. Bands like R.E.M., Nirvana, the Violent Femmes, and many other greats have taken the Velvet sound to new levels, but it all started with this quartet headed by Lou Reed. Buy this set. Every note on every album matters, and you'll never forget the experience of ""Sister Ray""."
2,Over Rated,"This album is one of those records that is bought by sophomores in college who want to look cool. It is soooo avante-garde and so hip to buy an album all the other cool people say that you should have. But upon listening to this record years later, I do have to say that it is really boring! The chord progressions are trite and simple. The production quality is lousy. The lyrics are about uninteresting people who have no socially redeeming qualities. The singing hurts my ears. Lou Reed is a terrible lead guitarist, and when he attempts to play ""fast"" he is about as lousy as they get. Sell this CD at a used record store and get a life! Spend your money on something else. You'll regret buying this boring piece of music in about 5 years. Trust me. Or else buy ""Rock and Roll Animal."" It's a somewhat better album."
1,Pretentious '60s garbage,"Pretentious lyrics, painful melodies, mediocre musicianship, a guest appearance from the enigmatic ""Nico,"" and an album cover that Andy Warhol spent five minutes designing. What's not to love? Well, everything. But this record has always been a critical favorite. Why? Because critics love music that no one else does, especially pretentious music. That's what separates music critics from the proletariat. So who do you believe, the critics, or your lying ears?"
1,Uhhh??,"I've been hearing about this band forever. People really like them. That's awesome. However, these guys dont even mask ripping off other artists. There She Goes Again, IS, Hitch Hike from the Rolling Stones. I have never heard a band rip off anything like that before.I think this CD is pretty lame. If you want to buy something different thats a bit off the mainstream, don't start here."
5,One of the Greatest Albums Ever,"In my growing up days, I listened to this album and The Clash's London Calling and little else for about three years straight. This album may be the most influential album of the past 40 years, amazing since most people haven't even heard of it."
4,Impressive overview,"A fine boxed set detailing one of America's premier experimental groups, it is still constructed for the knowledgeable (borderline obsessive perhaps) fan already familiar with their 4 studio discs, which work alone fine for me. The first disc of looping demos alone articulates this fan-intensive approach almost to an alienating degree, although the remaining four studio discs come packed with a treasure trove of B-sides, many of which are quite good in their unvarnished ways."
4,"Not current fashion, but...","This is the translation by Leonard A. Lyall, from 1909. As such, it uses the older Wade-Giles romanization. I prefer Ames & Rosemont from more recent translations, but this is very representative of its turn-of-the-20th-century type."
5,Nice Collection,"Great, quick inspirational sayings that are as timeless as they are full of wisdom. Good for people who are short on time."
4,Pretty Good,"I found this book to be very interesting, despite the fact that it seems to be mostly the sayings of his disciples. Some of the translations are pretty rough, making little sense. But hey, its free."
3,Confucius,Just looking for a read and with something that involved a well known philosopher. Still working my way through the book though.
3,Confucius says,Its neither bad nor good it is a preference thing and you have to see how you feel about it Im still undecided
2,i don't like it,it wasn't what i expected and didn't interest me like the other books i have purchased in the past couple weeks.
3,Good book!,"Good book, even better that it was free. Kindle format is not bad either. Umm idk what else to say."
3,A little too detailed for enjoyment of the meager.,"It is interesting to follow sayings of famous people. ""To know what we know, and know what we do not know, is wisdom"" is a little difficult to use in common society. But the book is fun to scan through."
1,tough read,tried this out as my first kindle free book. It is a pretty tough read. Maybe something is lost in translation but seems to jump around.
1,Don't Record Things When You're Ill,"Fahey explained this disaster by saying that he had a virus when it was recorded and during the playback. It's a very poor album, full of bum notes and uninspiring playing. There's plenty of potentially good material, but it's really an object lesson against recording things when you're ill. His producer should have called on him to re-record it when he was better. It's too late now, of course."
3,A return to the old days,"John Fahey is a very interesting composer of solo guitar music for the most part. This album is all instrumental, all solo guitar. Quite interesting and harkens back to his early days and his first recording, The Legend of Blind Joe Death, a name he made up for himself. It is less melodic than the 60s recordings, but still very Fahey-esque. I am giving this one three stars only because the first five albums all seem to deserve five stars. Probably the best place to start with Fahey is the Kottke/Lang/Fahey record or any of the first three albums. The later records are more mature and more eclectic. He is just a great musician and one of a kind. See reviews of his other albums for more insight. I just did not find this album as moving as the early works, America (!) or God, Time & Casuality, but still recommended!"
3,Celebrity Stereotypes,"While I enjoyed the book for what it is, Chick-Lit, I question how closely the Jill character is modeled after Jennifer Lopez. I seem to recall that Jennifer Lopez was set to produce and star in the movie version of ""Dirty Girls Social Club"" and wonder if something went wrong and she created an enemy in the author, for the character was vapid and, clearly, unflattering. With the former business relationship between the two I question why she feels this hatred towards her and how she was allowed to move forward with this ""fictional"" portrait!Again, the book does not profess to be more than it is, a Latin version of Chick-Lit, and it succeeds in creating a fast-moving plot with love stories, tragedies, etc. that I was excited to finish."
2,Read her first 2 books instead,"If you have never read any of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez's books, do not start with this one. Her first two books are good reads, with characters that you feel for and like. There isn't one character in this book that I liked. The lead is a superficial, whiny brat with a crush."
2,So -so,"I won't say the book was horrible, because it wasn't; nor will I say it was boring, because on the contrary, it kept me interested, but I will say that it had many faults. For one, the writing seemed a bit ""young"", similar to junior high and high school writing, and not that there's anything wrong with that, but I was expecting a more elaborate and mature sense of writing style, since the writer has written more than just one book. Also, the dialogue seemed so unreal. Yes, I know, it's a fictional story, but there was nothing to relate to, but also little fantasy to have fun with, and what I mean by that is that the characters were very underdeveloped, and many of the individual story lines seemed incomplete. At the end, I felt that I needed to read more, to feel I read a whole story. By the way, the book had many typos."
3,So so,This is not my favorite book by her. I love The Dirty Girls Social Club. This however wasn't her best effort in my opinion. It could have been better just not sure how.
3,A somewhat entertaining read,"This is the first book I've read that is written by this author and I was apprehensive at first. The back synopsis seemed a little flighty and contrived and I was wary of it being too predictable. In the end, it turned out to be funny and somewhat sweet. Yes, it was a bit much sometimes especially with the Jill Sanchez character, but still it kept my attention. A good vacation/beach read."
4,Quick and easy ... no brainer,"If you want a book that reminds you of a tabloid magazine, this is it. If you want something that removes you from your daily life, this is it. I enjoyed this book for the simple fact that it was a mindless and easy read. It's not a novel by any means, but a quick read."
1,wish there was a negative star,I would not let anyone in H.S. and definitely not in grade school read this book. Many inappropriate and unnecessary scenes. Thought I was reading the magazines at the grocery store.
3,Not her best,"I bought this book after reading the author's first two novels. The first two were great, this one was barely ok. The materialism and brand-name dropping is gratuitous and distracting. The characters are shallow and underdeveloped. Some characters -- Jill Sanchez, for one -- are so clearly based on real-life celebrities that there is no originality to their story. And the main character and narrator, while initially sympathetic, later becomes almost unbearably naive and annoying. I love high-end fashion, I love South Beach, and I subscribe to US Weekly. And even I thought this novel overdid it.However, there are some bright spots -- a short chapter told from the perspective of a cat was amazingly written. Some of the romances are touching. And the plot is interesting, even though the climax and ending seemed a little farfetched. Hopefully the author's next offering will have more originality and substance, and less flash."
1,"If I wanted to read US Weekly, I would have","I was extremely disappointed in this book. I loved her first two novels and expected much more out of this one. The blatant references to JLo (""JSan""? Really?) were unoriginal, the characters were weak and boring, the storyline itself was completely transparent. Don't waste your time or money on this book. Check it out from the library if you ""must"" read it, or check out one of her first two for a better read."
2,Valdes-Rodriguez Strikes Out,"As a fan of Alisa Valdes-Rodriguez, I had high expectations for ""Make Him Look Good"". It turned out to be a sore disappointment. Though it had its interesting moments, this book got to the point of being almost painful to keep reading. The writing was unimpressive, the plot completely over-the-top (even moreso than ""Dirty Girls""), and the author included sexual situations that were crass and unnecessary to the story. Characters were recognizable as parodies of Marc Anthony, Dayanara Torres, Jennifer Lopez, Tommy Matola, and Thalia. I'm not sure what Rodriguez has against these celebs, but wow. You know, on second hand, maybe you should read this book, just to see what I'm talking about. Piece of advice though: borrow it from a friend or the library. It's truly not worth your money."
3,Not looking too good,"I loved Valdes-Rodriguez's ""Dirty Girls Social Club""...it wasn't perfect but it had soul. Since then both her following books haven't impressed me much.Make Him Look Good is filled with one too many characters, as much as I'd like to know everybody's story it gets kind of annoying. The characters don't warm up to you as much, some I cared about, some I very happily skipped. They were all pretty much cookie cutter predictable characters. The story was also equally predictable. The most unbelievable was the way the end shaped up.It's a pass-time type of a read as long as your expectations are low!"
4,Plesant Surprise,"I usually shy away from anything depicted as a certain cultural fiction (this one labeled as ""Hispanic"") but was pleasantly surpised at how wrapped up in the story I got. It is definately more about women maturing and coming of age- a universal topic we can all relate to. I enjoyed all the different voices- it kept me interested and was similar to Judith Krantz novels in it's richness of character and plot development. I will definately be recommending her as a must read author for my all-caucasion book club!"
4,"Very nice, but a few annoying flaws","I love this series. I bpught it some time in November and have just started on King's Sacrifice. King's Test is a nice start. The best part of all the books, as well as the first, is the internal conflicts of Derek and Maigrey. Most of what kept me reading this book until late at night was trying to figure out just who the bad guy was. i quickly learned that its not that simple. I see how in one moment a good friend becomes a great enemy, and vice versa, then back agian. The turmoil is nonstop. The only real problems are the references to ancient Earth mythology and literature. There is a complete lack of references to anything ""modern"", save that of the Revolution. There's also the whole similarity to Star Wars. Some of the roles can be easily matched between this series and the Trilogy. Tusk= Han Solo, Sagan=Vader, Abdiel=Palpatine, the list goes on. There are enough differences that one can tell the two apart, but still..."
5,Excellent galactic fantasy on a grand scale!,This was a great book that a friend of mine introduced me to. The Warlord is an awesome villen. The characters and writing are great.
5,One of the best stories I have ever read!,Margaret Weis has written many books over the years that Ihave enjoyed but this is the first that I believe has atouch of greatness. Margaret has created a new universenever before seen and it is fantastic. This book is writtenin such a way as to never give away what is going to happennext with more twists and turns than a bag of pretzels.This book is one that will make you take the day off work tofinish and I suggest order the next volumes ahead of time oryou will regret it when you finish this one.
2,Not realy my type,"I did not like this book. However, that does not necesarily mean you wont. The main problem is that several (two) of the characters seem to be undecided as to weather they are going to be antagonists or protagonists. And if you didn't understand the meaning of the two words I just used, this book is too advanced for you. I would say that if a person likes a lot of internal strugle, gore, philosiphy (there is a line from ""Paradise Lost"" at the begining of every section, and quotes from various well known novels and poems at the begining of each chapter, not to metion the philosiphy that is writen into the story itself), but dosen't need a lot of action, then they would probably like this book."
2,I don't see what's all the fuss,"First I got to say I've been a Weis/Hickman fan for the last ten years and I've really love their other series, but this one...No, I don't really think this one is a good one. The characters are not completely developed and the story is so thin there isn't really one. As for the future world she developes I agree is quite good, it is, however, an almost exact copy of Star Wars (you only have to read about the bloodsword or XJ).To make it short, I'll only say, for all of you Weis fans that, like me, absolutely had to read this book: There are librareis, (and may Amazon forgive me.)"
2,Disappointing,"I can't figure out what book the other reviewers read because I have to disagree with all of them. I found the storyline to be predictible, and the dialogue was simple and uninspired. I didn't think any of the characters in the story were truly developed which made it hard to really care about any of them. There were also some errors in the hockey aspect of the book, such as having an NHL team play three days in a row. I wanted to like this book since I love hockey but I found it hard to get through because it failed hold my interest."
4,Weather or Not,"The item arrived in a really timely manner, which does not always happen with amazon orders. i appreciate that! And it was a really cute and touching movie. i had been unable to find it in any local video store so was excited to find it on amazon, and at a reasonable price."
2,"Cheap production, bad acting","I was surprised to see Mark Harmon in this low budget flick. The first scene where 'Weather Girl' loses it on the set is very poor dialogue and she cannot act for peanuts. No-one in the movie could act, even Mark Harmon! There is no situation or person in this movie that you start to cheer for. Just glad I did not buy it! A failure in my books."
2,"Blu-Ray, ""Forbidden Planet""","Here is the {Bottom-Line} on the Blu-Ray edition.The Video portion is just fine.The Audio that is suppose to be as I recall in 5.1 Surround is, ""Pitiful"".Sorry folks but you might as well here it the way it is before you order the Blu-Ray edition.I'm not going to get into the Movie in regards to the Special effects etc.I think all of us know about that.The real question that should be answered in this Review is about the Blu-Ray and if it is Good or Bad.Terry Honaker"
1,Poor Transfer for a Great Movie,I loved this movie on laserdisc but folks this DVD has poor color quality and a terrible video transfer. I would not purchase it until Criterion or somebody does a special edition.
5,The BEST!,Classic file that will forever be rated as GREAT in my books.Please continue the fantastic operation we have all come to adore.
2,Good movie - poor technology,"The movie would have been fine had the audio and video kept sync. Unfortunately the video got ahead of the audio and I kept having to stop and restart. Also, don't rent an online movie from Amazon until you're ready to watch it. They cut you off the momemt your 48 hours are up."
4,Value purchase.,"Good price on an ourstanding movie from the early sci-fi years. Have not actually looked at it, but I know it's goung to be good. A good sci-fi collectors item."
4,Forbidden Planet 1956,"My 6 year-old and 10 year-old grandsons loved ""Forbidden Planet!"" This ""early"" science fiction adventure movie features an amazing robot named Robby. My grandsonswere mesmerized by his strength and peaceful attitude. The romantic aspects of the movie were mostly light-hearted and elicited just a few ""yucks!"" I enjoyed this oldie but goodie film. If you are a science fiction fan (of any age), you'll get a kick out of ""Forbidden Planet!""George Hargrove"
4,Great classic SCI-FI,"While it shows it's age, this is a great SCI-FI movie. For being a pre-CGI flick, the animation of the 'Monster from the ID' is excellent. This show has many of the elements later used in STARTREK. . ."
4,Missing Element,"OK, this movied is a favorite. Having said that, I am less than blown away by this new transfer. Still looks a bit dull to me. It's a fun set though. Getting the box was a no-brainer. Am I the only one who's missing the poster offer? A sticker on the outside claims that the offer is to be found within. Well I don't see it..."
5,Still great even in the new century!,"This was made in a time when story telling was more important because special effects were at a premium, so they wouldn't look too hokey and laughable. The story was taken from Shakespeare and the acting is a bit wooden, but I still get lost in that time when I was 9 and the first time I seen this -please realize I saw Star wars just a couple of years earlier in one of only three times my father ever took us to a drive inn movie, - and it was still cool with Robbie, the animated monster, and other worldly sound track. The end is a bit of a disappointment but this happened I'm sure mainly cause of the lack of quality special effects. The extras on this are worth the price of admission. It doesn't rate high on my favorites list, if I had one, but I still like going back to that place and time."
4,Stylistic showcase of the 1950s,"This film defined the artistic design of sci fi for the 1950s. It's like an old sci fi magazine cover come to life. Props made for this film continued to appear in sci fi up to the 1960s. This is a must see for any sci fi fanatic.The only weak point in the film is the Anne Francis character that was clearly inserted for a bit of cheesecake. While she is lovely to look at, nothing she does drives the plot forward, and the entire film would be the same without her."
3,"Love the movie, but only 3 stars because it is not HD-DVD","I ordered the Ultimate Collectors Edition (HD-DVD) back in December. I finally got around to watching it yesterday in my weeks old Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player. To my surprise, I found that this disc is a standard DVD version which outputs at 480p, and not an HD-DVD. I think Amazon may have inadvertently mislabeled it. If you want a true high definition version, you must order the one with the red HD-DVD case or you will end up with a standard definition version.update: I contacted Amazon about the issue of receiving a standard DVD instead of an HD-DVD and they apologized and shipped me another Ultimate Collectors Edition (this time correctly in HD-DVD) and said that I could keep the standard def version as well. Amazon definitely does what it takes to ensure customer satisfaction. The image quality of the HD-DVD version is obviously better than the standard def version, but it will not blow you away in image quality."
5,Must-Have Collectible,Very much ahead of its time. Excellent. Great special features on the BluRay. Transfer for BluRay is great. A Science Fiction must-have collectible.
4,Sci-Fi at it's finest,"I had already had the DVD version of Forbidden Planet, but when I saw it available in Blue-Ray, I couldn't pass it up. I really enjoy the added features that are on the disc.I especially liked the concept ideas for Robby the Robot and, how much of a movie icon he has become, since this movie came out."
5,A Classic,"This movie is a classic. It is one of the best sci-fi movies from the 1950's. Besides Walter Pidgeon - you will see many recognizable faces in the cast (if you are 40 years or older).It won awards for special effects and it introduces ""Robby the Robot"". A ""remake"" of Shakespeare's Tempest - it is a great movie."
5,The best,"As the previous reviewer said there isn't much more to be said. This is one of the greatest science fiction films ever made. Its even more remarkable for being over 50 years old now, as some of the special effects, if dated now, are good enough to make you think 'how the hell did they do that in 1956'? Remember no CGI at all.Its influence on the original Star Trek series in terms of the story and the sets is clear for all to see: A long dead civilisation leaving behind a mind enhancing machine. An apparent Alien force that can't be seen. Sets made of polystyrene etc....Quite a few important Science Fiction films were made in the 1950's, but this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. If you've never seen it you've missed an absolute classic."
4,A Fifties Sci-Fi Classic,"I love it: great cast, great sets, great colour, cod-Shakespeare story spin-off (the Tempest), invisible monsters, flying saucers, robots, unique soundtrack. This really is a must in any sci-fi collection. It's not erudite, or genre making, but just a great piece of entertainment and escapism.When I bought mine, there was no European version (region 2) available, but the region 1 disc is nice (if you have a multi-region player) as it is double-sided with widescreen (16:9) on one side and academy ratio (TV 4:3) on the other."
5,Forbidden Planet,I am very impressed with the way this product purchase went. I ordered the DVD and expected it to take 4 to 5 days before delivery. It arrived in 3 days with no issues. I played the video the day I recieved the movie and did not have any problems with the disc.
3,DVD is a major disappointment,"This great film is simply transfered from a somewhat marginal LD digital transfer from MGM. Every noise spot, etc. is there.This really deserves some careful cleaning up if this is the best original MGM can find.Again, a great film. If you have LD, don't buy this, it is no improvement at all. If you have tape, it might be worth the cost."
5,Forbidden Planet: The all-time best sci-fi movie?,"While typing away on my computer and watching one of the cable premium channels the other day, I came upon the Sci-fi classic, Forbidden Planet. This was the first time I'd seen it from beginning to end. I was amazed at the great special effects, acting and overall storyline of this movie. I must have this for my private collection. This movie holds up as well today as it did more than 40 years ago. I highly recommend this classic to any sci-fi buff."
5,Monsters from the id.,"The new digital transfer print of this classic sci-fi movie gives the movie a new life for another generation. Watching this gem you will be able to see the influence that it had on the directors of today, Riddley Scott, George Lucas, James Cameron & Steven Spielberg.The extras are all worth watching, there are no ""filler"" special features that really aren't worth the bother. The clarity of the images printed on the tin box are amazing. All up, a definitive version well worth owning.Note: My multi-region player had no problem with the region 1 enhanced coding."
5,French language,I can tell to french customers that these DVD do have french language and french subtitles
5,movie is sadly unbeatable;,"do you feel the dark ages coming?Serioulsy, Nielson obviously knew he'd never see another movie like that in his lifetime and went into comedy for the rest of his life!Seriously, a movie that is still relevent at least to our future.About all the added stuff; glad they left it out! Well, the extra scenes of the approach of the planet might have been nice, but everything else deserved to not be included.About the electronic music - if you listen to actual nasa data of space noise, you'll see the movie is both ahead of its day and intellectually superior to anything else since then even 2001! That is what a space movie is suppose to sound like because that is the sound of outer space!"
4,a real special edition,"This Ultimate Collector's Edition HD DVD reminds me in a very positive way of the ""good old laserdisc special edition"" days wich unfortunately have gone the way of the Dodo.Lots of special features on the disk and also lots of goodies in the metal casing.The only minus in my humble opion is the size of robbie the robot, wich is extremly small 3,5"" ...come on....and not very detailed, maybe Warner should have asked the guys from wetaworkshop to make a sculpture of the robot carrying the girl(like in the movieposter).Neverheless its a grand Special Edition wich will make you enjoy this movie to the fullest."
5,Forbidden Planet Bu-Ray - an incremental upgrade,"In comparing the 50th Anniversary Edition to this Hi Def release, I would say the Video quality is marginally better, a little more detail is there. The special features are the same here, no more or less. It's the uncompressed Audio that makes the Blu-Ray Disc a must-have for fans. Sound clarity is present, one can distinctly hear the breathing of the id monster as it approaches and ascends the stairs of the starship, even while the guards are speaking."
5,Forbidden Planet [Blu-ray] (1956),"The Blu-ray transfer,etc. is simply ""OUTSTANDING"".This movie was made in 1956 without CGI and 2,000 people making it all happen.And yet this movie was way ahead of it's time. Many movies that followed used this movie as a blueprint on how to make a GOOD Sci-Fi movie.5 stars plus. A must see."
3,They Coulda done better.......,"This movie is one of the all time classics and it never disappoints when watched. However, this presentation has no extras and is cheaply packaged. As the title says, they could have done better!"
3,Fair Reproduction Hi Def Movie,"I have always liked sci-fi movies with this one being no exception. Receieved the movie in good condition, watched it and enjoyed the movie, but really expecting a little better picture in hi-def thou. When watching it either on my 47"" samsung 1080p or my hp 720p computer, the picture had alot of like grain in it and was not smooth or that clear..(That of course is just my opinion), others may disagree... I thought cause maybe its an older movie, but have a few others just as old that don,t have this. Otherwise good movie.."
2,Poor blu ray,The blu ray version is barely superior to the DVD...it is very grainy.Not worth the upgrade.
2,I GOT THIS IT'S OK BUT NOT ALL THAT ASK THE CRELL !,IF YOU LIKE.. ROBBIE THE ROBOT ! IT'S NICE TO SEE HIM IN OTHER STUFF... THE TOY FIGURE IS TOO SMALL SAVE MONEY ? GET THEM ONE AT A TIME THE TIN IS OK BUT CAN GET BANGED UP IN THE MAIL THEN YOU WILL WANT YOUR CRELL MIND TO GO OUT AND GET CRAZY ON THE FED/X OR BROWN GUY TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK !
3,Review of Forbidden Planet,"This classic sci-fi movie has been one of my favorites for decades, and I was pretty eager to see this again without TV interruptions. However, I found that I'd bought a reformatted version, which is my main reason for 3 rather than 5 stars. This should definitely be seen in widescreen. Be careful when you buy to check the format."
5,Forbidden Planet is a Movie close to heart,"I woved this movie...it has the name Pidgeon as someone's name...that's funny...anyway, it is a movie that is woosly based on my wife!"
4,Almost great,Everything ok except metal box items came in was dented a little. Based on packaging I would have to say it was that way when it went into the shipping container.Unfortunate
4,excellent restoration!,This DVD is a very good restoration of this sci-fi classic! The last time I saw this film on TV it was avery poor and deteriorating copy! This is a very crisp and clear restoration! I like it!
5,FORBIDDEN PLANET,EACH TIME I SEE IT FROM THE FIRST TIME IT CAME OUT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO TO THE DVD IT HOLDS UP EVEN WITH SOME OF THE NEW ONES
1,What a disappointment!,"While the movie ""Forbidden Planet"" is a landmark science fiction movie, and well worth including in anyone's media library, I cannot recommend the DVD version sold here. The widescreen side is distorted, with characters and perspective appearing tall and narrow; and the TV-formatted side is dark, fuzzy, and poorly dubbed. In my opinion, anyone interested in purchasing this movie for their home library should be sure to buy it in a brick-and-mortar store where they can view the version being sold to assure its quality. That would hold true of the VHS version as well as the DVD version, since it is probable that the same distributor who made the DVD version also made the VHS version sold here. I should have paid attention to other reviewers who have had the same disappointing result from purchasing this DVD as I have. I am writing this review so that others won't make the same mistake I did."
4,Forbidden Planet 50th Annviversary Edition,"I must admit, for a 50th anniversary edition, I expected the picture quality to be better. Don't get me wrong, the picture does not suck, it is good, just expected better for a 50th anniversary edition. As far as the movie goes, and anyone who has ever seen it knows, it is just a really great science fiction movie for its time. Still a classic today! Any sy fy fan who does not have this should get it!"
4,Classic,"I was pleasantly surprised with the graphics of this movie. Also, I was better able to like and appreciate the story and characters as an adult since the last time I saw this movie was in my childhood. I recommend it to any science fiction fans."
4,Looks great on Blu-ray,"I've viewed this film in various formats since the 1960s. The Blu-ray transfer is by far the best version. I suspect it looks better than most of the prints that originally went through theaters in 1956. They put a lot of effort into making this picture look great.When I'm paying twice the price for a Blu-ray disk than I do for a DVD, I do it to get a better image. And so often this is not the case. But I definitely got my money's worth on Forbidden Planet.As far as the movie itself goes, it's a clever premise and Walter Pidgeon knew how to act. But the other actors are pretty stinko. And the screenwriting is just plain awful. However, it's worth seeing just for the analog special effects that had to have been the best put in any movie of the 1950 decade. And with this excellent transfer the effort behind them really shows.Besides, how can you possibly pass up watching 30-year old Leslie Nielson playing a straight romantic lead in high definition?!?!?"
2,A real disappointment,I purchased this DVD in the hopes that I would be seeing the original CINEMASCOPE print of this sci-fi classic. Sadly the only frames in Cinemascope are the opening credits. The rest of this glorious film has been chopped up to accommodate a standard format. What a loss!
4,A well loved classic,"Tremendous special effects, and a great plot, combine to form a movie that is very watchable even today. Some of the acting is a bit old-fashioned, but the style is amazing.This DVD transfer is about average, clear and bright but taken from a rather faded print. I saw a lower-definition broadcast of it which did have better colours. However, it's a miracle these old movies are now frozen in time, no more deterioration (is this true?)"
5,Awesome DVD,"Highly recommend this DVD version of Forbidden Planet. The quality of the transfer is clean and crisp. The extras on the second DVD is worth watching. If you are a fan of 1950's science fiction movies, this is a must have for your collection."
5,FORBIDDEN PLANET,THIS MOVIE IS EX. THE SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE GREAT AND THE COLOR IS ALSOGREAT. FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY.
5,Science Fiction Fans Will Love This!,"Your Science Fiction collection will not be completewithout this ultimate Forbidden Planet Set! It ISthe first major Science Fiction movie to be made inglorious color, and from a major Studio... Great castand this set even includes a miniature ""Robby the Robot""to put on display, WOW! The backup material in thiscollection is worth the price... A must for earlySci-fi fans!"
5,THE CORNERSTONE OF MODERN DAY SCI-FI,"It would be difficult even in todays hi-tech fx to come even close to this incredible and believable 43 year old masterpiece which also helped to launch at least 5 major actors careers. As I replay this film over and over again. it would be a travesty not to own this great video transfer on DVD. If an attempt to recreate this film is even remotely considered, I would have to say that in thiscase, there should be very little deviation from the original story line. It will take years before people really understand the foresight this flick has had on tomorrows movies!"
1,Forbidden Planet,Region details not available. Does not play on Australian DVD player. Waste of money in the end. :(
1,BAD DVD - not the movie just the DVD received,"I received the DVD. It would not play on my DVD player. Thinking that the HD DVD would not play on the older DVD player, I purchased an HD DVD player only to find out the DVD was actually BAD - NOT IN PLAY MODE."
5,Forbidden Planet A True Classic,"It was very nice to be able to order Forbidden Planet from Amazon, but more importantly, this movie is a TRUE Sci-Fi classic. Young and old should watch this together. Robby The Robot to this day still permeates our society as what a robot is and can do for man. Usage of humor, the lack of bad language and a great story equates this movie to one of the all time greats."
4,Ahhh the Krell,"Although the special effects are somewhat primitive, the sense of drama that is created as the secret, left-behind machinery and technology of this ancient civilization are revealed, are mesmerizing. Or at least they are to me, at the age of 54, years after having seen this for the first time on a small B&W television. More dated are the sexual innuendos, and, of course, the references to alcohol."
4,Forbidden Planet,"Considering the year that this movie was filmed, the special effects are very sophisticated, and the story interesting. It is fun to compare the space exploration in this movie to what is going on today."
4,"Comedy Surley? (no, and don't call me Shirly)",A great film with elements of action and in depth story lead to a well crafted peice of cinema. The only real drawback to the experience id that you spend the entire film waiting for Lesley Neilson to deliver a punchline that you subconsiously know is never coming.
2,not quite as pictured,"The DVD's are fine, the postcards are an intersting touch, BUT the robot is a smaller than pictured solid rubber model with a decal face. Placed in a tin box, I would rather have spent $20 less for the DVDs alone."
5,The reason DVD was created,"The DVD version of ""Forbidden Planet"" does extreme justice to this incredible movie which is one of the best science-fiction films ever made, and my personal favorite. It captures the film's original brilliance with crystal-clear sound and picture and offers a variety of options which prove the greatness of the DVD format. Offering both Widescreen AND Pan & Scan (which extremelly diminishes the beautiful cinematography) as well as both English and French versions [NOTE: watching the French version with English subtitles can increase the viewer's feelings of superiority and overall pretentiousness.] This DVD truly is the reason the format was created."
5,great movie at a great price,great movie at a great price hope to deal with again. woulg recommend this movie to everyone. great price too
4,Just like the............,"..........song that's the theme for ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" states; it's a fun for the family goofy sci fi schlock flick. It's fun; try it!!!!!"
5,Not happy with packaging,"The item I purchased was a Christmas present for my father-in-law. I had it shipped directly to him in Kansas. However, when it was opened the packaging was not sufficient to keep the item I purchased from getting CRUSHED. This was a rather expensive purchase and considered a ""collector's edition"" I was not 100% satisfied with the way the item arrived."
5,Mr.Movie will be very happy with this one,"Well this film is Mr.Movie Steve Friedman,who for years has not only been the top movie critic in the business but a great friend to myself and others on The big Talker 1210 in Philadelphia.I had heard Steve talk about this movie for years and went back and looked at it and indeed its one of the true classics along side the likes of The Wizard Of Oz,plus its a chance to see Leslie Nielson be a real serious actor.Well Steve I,am glad you will finally get to see This Great Film your all time great pick and see it like it was meant to be seen on fabulous Blu Ray.Scott Denny"
3,T.Johnston Review,"I did not care for this movie, but my Dad loved it. So for him a gave this movie a good review."
3,Happy Halloween!!!,"I just watched this for the first time tonight with my dad. I've seen clips of it in 'John Carpenter's Halloween' The movie itself was okay. I loved the classic sci-fi look and atmosphere it had. Commander Adams takes his team to Planet Altair. They are to check on Dr. Morbius, who has been there for 20 years. While there, they must battle an invisible beast created by the doctor himself. Robby the Robot is awesome and my favorite character. If you want a classic science fiction flick, you'll enjoy FORBIDDEN PLANET!!!"
5,Second Review,"This is my 2nd comment on this item.I had the original dvd of the movie, but gave it away after the collector edition arrived. The picture quality and sound is the ultimate You can get with a dvd. The extra items included with the collection are priceless to me and the deleated and outtake scenes are a must see for real sci-fi fans. Dont Miss this chance to own this ultimate collection at this price or any price. You'll be glad You bought this. I am."
5,One of the Best!,"To say that ""Forbidden Planet"" is one of the best, timeless classics of Sci-Fi is no exaggeration! This is clearly the inspiration behind many of today's movies & television shows, and when one watches this great movie, it's not difficult to see why. With the characters, the setting, the romance, the special effects & the psychological over-tones of this film, this is clearly a movie that is well worth watching over & over & over!"
5,Classic,"Great classic science fiction movie, one of my favorites. remastered with great color and clarity. A must have for serious collectors."
5,Amazing,"The effects are amazing for its time. Story compelling. If you enjoy this and get a chance go see, check out Return to Forbidden Planet Shakespeare's Lost Rock and Roll Musical."
5,Forbidden Planet,A classic that I've enjoyed from my youth. It is great to seeit again and to share with friends.
3,Rather disappointing Blu Ray transfer,"The Blu-Ray edition of this classic is rather disappointing. It's a double-layer BR disc, but the whole package uses about 32 gigs and LESS THAN 20 gigs are devoted to the feature. As with all Cinemascope pictures, the camera negative is compressed and the uncompressed screen image is fuzzier than standard ratio films of the period. The upshot is the feature looks only marginally better than the DVD. The HD soundtrack, mastered from the original four-track recordings, has never sounded better, though. ""Invisible Boy"" and all the other material on the second disc of the two-disc DVD has been ported over and most of it is not in hi-def."
2,Poor reproduction.,"I bought this film because it has always been one of my favorite classic Sci-Fi moves. It has everything from monsters to sexy women. But it was a real disappointment for me to have to watch this poor quality reproduction. I will hope that someday another production company will remake this with the quality it deserves. If I wanted this junk, I could have stuck with my old VHS."
4,"Nice set, but the poster arrived in terrible shape!","Great HD-DVD set, love the tin, miniature Robby, lobby cards, extra features...etc. But the poster that I waited 8 weeks for arrived in a flimsy, dented cardboard tube which didn't even have end caps (!), and the poster itself was crinkled, creased mess. What a disappoinment. I'd gladly have paid a few bucks more for shipping if they'd sent it in a sturdier tube. :("
5,Forbidden Planet Ultimate Collector's Edition,This is a great addition on any collection. The packaging is very well done. The DVD has exceptional visual quality. A lot of information about the movie and how it started it all for true outer space science fiction.
3,"Love it, but...",I love this movie. It's classic science-fiction. But the DVD transfer leaves some to be desired. The picture often has bits of fuzz and other debris that you just wouldn't expect with a DVD.
4,Definitively to watch if you love bad movies.,"Leslie Nielsen as the captain of intrepid purebred horny spacemen ? Robbie the Robot ? A long-lost civilization ? This romp to planet Altair, besieged by an unknown evil force, is unbelievably hilarious for its pulp and sixties sensibility. The movie always threatens to morph into a weird episode of some sixties sitcom with a name like ""Leave it to Beaver"" in outer space. Bonus points for having a story that actually makes sense and manages to be interesting, despite the movie being hilarious. Definitively to watch if you love bad movies."
5,Still One of the Best,I saw this film when it first appeared in the 1950s. I've been a movie buff all my life. This film is as entertaining and packed with surprises today as it was then. But one does notice the changes in the roles of women since then. A five star movie for sure.
2,a rip off,i would not advise any one to waste their money on this blu-ray package for one main reason. sound track IS NOT 5.1!!! the entire movie soundtrack played out through my center speaker ONLY! the regular 2 disc 50th anniversary has the dolby sound. so if you have that stick with that and forget the blue ray until they decide to include a good sound track. i mean if you are watching a movie on the big screen don't you want surround sound too?
2,"As the first SF film that tried to be good, it's worth watching, but judged on its own, it's stiff, shallow and SLOW.","I tried to watch this and couldn't. Anne's legs kept distracting me from the mind deadening godawful dialog---and her legs weren't even that good. Despite the scenery, effects and main idea, it's still not worth watching as a film. Want a great SF film? Watch Fifth Element or Aliens"
3,Forbidden Planet - interesting concept,"The best thing about Forbidden Planet is the concept of the power of Freud's 'Id'. Otherwise, without the base on earth from the 1950s, such as in This Island Earth, War of the Worlds, It Came from Outer Space, The Day the Earth Stood Still & maybe The 27th Day, it lacks the charm of comparison with the era then, thus has to be compared with the 'total space' movies of the latter part of the century, like the original Star Wars - still the top of the genre, Alien & Star Trek II the Wrath of Khan. The best films of aliens or futuristic creations combined with earth settings, like Blade Runner, Solaris, Terminators 1&2, Starman, Dark City, or even the inner space of Tron from more contemporary times have a far more sophisticated resonance for repeated viewings. In sum, after seeing it again after many years, I found Forbidden Planet fairly boring & simply not very well done overall."
2,HOAKY,"Saw this movie at the theater when it was released. I was about 13 years old at the time and thought it was the second best movie I had ever seen (Around The World In 80 Days being number 1). Since then I have owned it on Laser Disc but will not add it to my Bluray collection because of the HOAKY ARTIFICIAL SOUNDS. When they remake it and put in some REAL music, I will buy (but I'm not holding my breath)."
4,The Barney stuff rules.. Dorian stuff is OK,"Mass Appeal Madness is slower than the usual ND hyper jaunt but no less brutal. A great ""song"" where as sometimes (at this point in their career) their tunes tended to blend together at times. ""Pride Assassin"" has that great trade off low vocals from Barney and screaming from Mick...it's awesome. Again, another ""memorable"" tune. All the tunes here that featuere Barney are both memorable and brutal.. fantastic stuff. If you enjoyed Utopia Banished or Harmony Corruption this should appeal to you (although minus the hyper drums a good amount of the time). Dare I say that some of these songs are ""catchy""?I don't particularly like the Lee Dorian cuts... at this point in recording history I think a lot was lost on bands that were so ""low"" especially vocally. Rerecorded today it might have come out different but the product on the CD is a bit muddy.This CD is worth the $$ even if half of it is weak."
5,The design makes sense....,"I spent way too much time picking out my last ice cream scoop (I can never get those 30 minutes of my life back!), so benefit from the time I spent... When picking an ice cream scoop, a couple of things to consider. 1) The handle: having a handle that ""gives"" with you a bit is a plus, I like this handle because most of it is stainless steel so it looks good, but it has the OXO flexibility where it counts. 2) the actual scoop itself: the ""business end"" of this tool should be pointed, it only makes sense. I used to use a spade, but it just isn't as effective when trying to get through hard ice cream. This design works beautifully. One more thought, ignore the scoops that have a lever to release the ice cream, its not necessary and is likely to break eventually. Spare yourself further searching and go with this one..."
3,A good remake - entertained - with a few drawbacks,"It was hard to imagine Ryan Renolds without his comedic overtone but he proved to be a great dramatic actor as well. So Hollywood puts out another Remake? - so whats the verdict? I always thought the original was a really scary film.... and this one..although it didnt give me the same creepiness it still was a worthy opponent. Some of the new special effects added were effective, and of course they messed with the script again to yet give another variant. The back history part that was added, didnt make for better story-telling...so to leave it alone would have been better. In my opinion the part where the house tells the priest to ""GET OUT"" lacked the power of the original...which was a rememorable part. I liked the enhanced editing in this version which added a new level of creepiness, and the story really didnt have many slow parts... so overall I call this a great effort that I enjoyed in the cinema as well(Eyesofchaos dot com)"
3,Needed to be more scarier,This movie is not scary at all. It blows. The amityville horror four is way better than this. There should have been scarier parts in this movie
4,good movie,"This movie kept your interest. One of the better scary movies out there since it was actually believable, unlike most out there today."
2,Amityville Redux!,"This had a lot of potential. Had a good atmosphere to it. Ryan Reynolds was actually pretty good here as well. The rest..ahh. What you have here is a very forced and silly movie that just doesn't live up to all it could have. The changes were all for the worse. Whats with the whole secret Indian Cave area? Don't you think someone would have noticed that at some point? Like ever? According to George Lutz that isn't what happened..yep one of those lets add crap for the sake of adding crap. THe whole Lutz story may or may not be a crock, but you could at least adapt their story and not make up some crap..very disappointing. Overall one of those bigger budget and updated look and feel don't make a better movie..Don't get me wrong the original isn't a masterpiece, but at least it was true to The Lutz's story and not a crock..."
4,Ryan Reynolds in Remake,"This is a great rehashing of the original. Ryan Reynolds goes for a change of pace from his typical comedy role to deliever a great performance in this thriller/horror remake.The Lutzs move into a fixer-up of a house in mid-1970s Amityville, NY. Just a year prior to their move in a grizzly murder occured in the same house. Now all kinds of freaky things are happening. But is it the ghost of the prior residents or does this go back hundreds of years when an evil priest was torturing the natives?Whatever it was, it drove the Lutz family away from Amityville, never to return, not even for theise possessions."
3,So?,Another remake lacking any real reason. Im getting sick of some of the remakes way did I have to pay to see the same show. I cant see the difference from the old one. The acters may even be wores. expiate the wife is more f^$kabal but there are some improvements. But not as many as one Should expect
1,"Oh the horror, the horror.","Please do not under any circumstances buy, rent or borrow this film. It is that bad. No not even funny bad. I made the mistake of giving this ""film"" a chance and had my good intentions thrown back in my face by a weak story line that resembled nothing in the reasonably frightening book, pathetic acting, cliched special effects, and way to much of the lead actor half naked. This film would be a great lesson for future film makers in how NOT to make a scary movie.I suppose the ritalin addicted youth market may enjoy this film for its quick cut scenes that play out like a bad cross of a music video and out takes from ""Jacobs Ladder"", and they certainly will not have to focus on anything to cerebral here either. Please if you want a decent haunted house film check out the original B/W ""The Haunting"" and avoid this piece of *%^$*^%!!!!!! I gave this one star as the option for no stars does not exist."
5,M-AZING!!!!!,"i loved it, it was so freakin scary. pop-outs throughout the whole movie. i saw it aat the theater and one part made me jump so high i spilled popcorn on the person next to me. there was an even amount of gore and freakyness which is what i like. i mean, whats cooler then a dead girl putting someones finger in the bullet hole in her own head. just sticking it in. i absolutely loved this movie, but theres only one thing that i didnt like about it. for anyone who has seen the original one, he kills the dog. i dont care about people dying in movies but i care about animals dying in movies. so i think anyone who loves scary movies should definitly add this one to your collection."
4,More Historically Accurate than the original,"I wouldn't call this remake exactly a horror flick, it was more of an interpretation of the real life story the original Amityville Horror was based on with a few scary scenes added to pay homage to the original film.This movie is really about the secret tension that exists in most families and how at times it can get taken to far. A man moves into a house with his new wife and her children from previous sex and they all seem to get along until a demonic presence in the house possesses him and encourages him to kill them all. The same spirit that alledgedly possessed a man some years earlier and caused him to kill his siblings and parents in the same house this new family now lives in. In real life, the jury didn't buy that story, but who knows? In real estate that say that location is everything, so if any of you are thinking about buying a place, don't buy a house built on the gateway to Hell. It's a bad investment."
3,The Calamityville Horror,"One year after a twenty three year old man goes on a rampage and murders his entire family in their sleep, a young couple (James Brolin and Margot Kidder) move into their house. They fled in terror twenty eight days later. Some effective scenes, but some things meant to be ""scary"" are unintentionally laughable. Very effective score, which was originally written for ""The Exorcist"" six years earlier and had sat unused during that time. Credibility of this haunted house story has been hotly contested for years, and the tormented family has often changed their versions of what had happened during that twenty eight days. Film is watchable despite these idiosyncrasies. Followed by a pseudo prequel that detailed the lives of the murdered family, and several other sequels that basically just capitalize on this sensation. Good campy fun, but I would take this with a grain of salt."
3,still a scary good time,"Much has been debated about the ""true events"" thisfilm was based on. I have to admit, when I first saw THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, it really freaked me out, especially since I was unaware at the time of the ""hoax"" rumors. Still, I thought it was scary.In seeing the film again, I have to say it hasn't matured particularly well. There are still many scenes which give me goosebumps (hello, those glowing red eyes in the window and the demon voice telling Rod Steiger to ""GET OUT! ""), but I now find the film to be very slow moving and some of the dialogue to be silly.On the plus side, Margot Kidder STILL makes for a wonderful heroine (check her out in BLACK CHRISTMAS too!)and the climax is still one of my all time favorite, energy charged escapes. The blood pouring down the walls and stairs... Margot's face turning old and wrinkled... the ""eye"" windows shattering... it all still makes for some spooky good fun if you're willing to endure the ""down times.""... END"
4,IT WILL GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A MONTH,"I, personally believe in the house. If it is a hoax, then why do they keep going on about 1 house? Very scary, but would have been even scarier if it would have followed Anson's book completely. (Like if it would have shown the lavetating secne, the statue moving, etc.)"
2,"Some good scares, but boring.","The Amityville Horror, to tell you the truth, is a yawner. The movie took a long time to get going and it was very fake. There are some scary parts in it. Such as when the lady gets possesed at the passage to Hell. But, the rest of the movie is a yawner."
5,Cant Wait,"I cant wait to see this movie. This movie looks so much scarier than the original, and it seems to be much more atmospheric, and hopefully this movie isnt butchered down to a PG-13 level, so all the goodies will remain! The trailers are just enough to put me on edge, and I havent seen something scary for a long time, and most nothing scares me, and i hope this movie will change all that!"
1,come on!,"I live in amityville. The whole story about the young guy killing his family is totally real... but the whole amityville horror is pathetic! I know for a fact that the house isn't haunted. I've known the last 2 families that have lived there, both friends of mine, and they say there is no chance that the house is haunted. The house is a beautiful house though, but all thw windows are covered with blinds to keep all the tourists to stop from looking in!"
1,Amityvill Horror is right!,This movie is stupid and dull. Not to mention laughable special effects. I have seen more done with less! I especially hated the way we had to fall back on the marrital relations yet again. And we had to look at that fuzzy faced man. Even the flies were silly! Didn't Rod Steiger have anything better to do that day!
1,"zero stars, dont waste your time.",what movie were the people watching that give this tripe 5 stars ?????here is a good synopsis for this movie..... a series of completely unexplained events followed by the end of the movie.i hope you dont waste your time on it. whats even stranger was that they made an equally bad remake of it too.
1,It isn't even a matter of opinion!,"Empirically, this movie [stinks]. The book itself turned out to be a hoax, but even still, had the movie simply stuck to the book, it would have been all it was ever meant to be -- scary. But there are so many red herrings, so many scenes where something terrifying turns out to be just a spouse walking into the room or the wind blowing, that impatience soon turns to exasperation. People actually thought this movie was frightening? Now THAT'S frightening!"
2,Not great,"This movie wasn't that scary. It had its moments but wasn't that great. I had heard how scary is was but now I know it isn't. This is about a couple and their kids who move into a house that years earlier, had murders commited in it. Their isn't much action and the story is good, but they didn't go far with it. Don't waist your time with this. If you want a good haunted house story, see THE CHANGELING."
1,Would give 0 if possible...,"Bad acting, bad cinematography, bad effects, bad editing, incoherent storyline, completely devoid of anything terrifying, and an anticlimactic ending. What else is there to say. See The Changeling instead if you actually want to be freaked out since this movie is nothing but a freakishly bad waste of time."
1,Movie actually PROVES the story is a hoax,"This is one of those amazing films where NOTHING seems to happen. Scene after scene of James Brolin acting rude and obnoxious, then some doors gets locked, cut to Steiger (a horrible performance) jawing about having the flu, then repeat. Eventually, the family leaves the house...that's it. Boring and relentlessly tepid and unfrightening. It's become common knowledge that the story is untrue, and this movie actually proves it by showing nothing that couldn't be produced by the Lutz's overactive imaginations, their broken heating systems (that's the truth, folks!), and George's need to get some cash. Three years later, this was practically remade as POLTERGEIST, a haunted house flick that deserves your hard-earned money a lot more than this poverty-row snore. Oh by the way, ""Jodie"" was actually the neighbor's cat, Evinrude, who liked to climb up trees and look in the windows of adjacent houses."
1,For God's sake...get out of the theather,"I saw this movie for free and I want my money back. The screening I saw was filled with laughter at the trite dialog and ""hand on the shoulder, oh, it's just my husband"" fake scares. This movie was one of the worst I've seen this year."
1,Another Remake How Suprising..............,"I think Hollywood has ran out of Ideas that is why they keep doing remakes.I have not seen this movie and do not intend to. 1-You cannot simply cannot compare Texas Chainsaw, The Ring, to this movie I adored the original and that has gone down in History But all this hollywood crap of Horror Movies Really (...).................... 2-I'm sure this movie is predictable and has the same plot like every other remake a chilling little girl from what I read Phony Digital Gaphics and Untalented Actors. 3-The whole legend of the Amityville is extremely exagerrated. 4-I 'm sure that once it's release on dvd people who were so thrilled about when it came out will sell there dvd because they realize that it sucks and it's just like every other stupid modern horror that hollywood comes out with. Amazon will be loaded with and it will sell super cheap because I guarntee that this stupid remake will not go down in history as a Horror Classic........................"
1,Overrated mumbo jumbo,"This film was a big hit back in 1979. Truth be told, it's one of the most overrated films of all time. First of all, the events in the movie did not happen. That's ok, most horror is fiction, but the book upon which the movie was based is so much better than this poorly produced flick, you might as well read the book. The only saving grace is the wonderful, creepy score."
5,A Classic.GET OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I rate this movie Good to Excellent.A few scenes sent chills down my spine and gave me goosebumps,now that's what i call a good horror movie.Never will forget that line that Kidder said 'She Was Shot In The Head'.A very well picked cast and Margot Kidder really a HOT Babe.When i look at James Brolin what comes to mind is Dr.Kiley from Marcus Welby M.D. what a transformation.I recommend this movie if you want some old-fashioned thrills and chills.An American Classic with a cool twin windows title logo,who can forget that."
5,The Amityville Horror,"The Amityville Horror is about a large house on the coast of Long Island where newly weds George and Kathy Lutz and their three children move into the house that they hope will be their dream house but it ends up in terror. Despite full disclosure by the real estate agent of the home's history, George and Kathy buy the house. George says, ""Houses don't have memories,"" but they turn to their family priest Father Delaney who believes the house is haunted and performs an exorcism on the house. But the evil spirit in the house causes him to become blind and makes him very ill. George and Kathy with the help of another priest Father Bolen and a police detective they face the fears of the house, but not knowing the spirit is planning to possess George and then the children. ""The Amityville Horror"" has all the trappings of an excellent haunted house story. A very good supernatural thriller. If you enjoy being scared out of your wits, this movie will do it for you."
3,Plenty of buildup horror,"The Amityville Horror tells the story of a family moving into a possessed house, and builds up in the familiar way, where everything seems great at first, till slowly, things get worse and worse, as the father begins to lose some of his self control. Good performances, a classic horror tale, where walls bleed, chandeliers sway and doors creak open. And yes, there's something in the basement. It's not as exciting as some other haunted house horrors, but it is a required classic for any true haunted house movie collector. Now I'm waiting for the DVD release of the sequel, part 2."
