3,How to Be President: What to Do and Where to Go Once You're in Office,How to Be President: What to Do and Where to Go Once You're in Office - Interesting book just for the curious. However bought it not for fact but interest. Do not know how accurate it is.
4,Works really well with Motorola Phone Tools and my Razr phone.,"I bought this to sync my Razr phone with Outlook 2003 on my computer. Using Motorola Phone Tools software and the Belkin adapter allows me to sync to the contact list, upload and download photos and download ring tones to the phone. All this is easily done wirelessly. All I have to do is turn on the phone in the same room as the computer and away I go."
4,light duty,"I wouldn't call these ""heavy"" duty, more like the thickness of a plastic bag from the grocery store - very thin. But, if you use to to catch paint droppings, this will do the job. If you need to cover oriental rugs so that the urine from your guinea pigs doesn't accidentally go through the blankets that they run on top of, then this is wicked good. does the job. I think. They never had an 'accident' yet since they use the toilet, like ladies. But one can never be too safe."
1,1ml thickness is too thin,"Purchased this item with the intent to rake leaves onto it and pull the leaves to the street. The product is too thin to accomplish this. When I pulled it out to the street over the grass and some sticks it tore in several places. Didn't really focus on the thickness when I purchased it, but you need a thicker plastic than 1ml."
1,WTF,"I order the thing for $5.95 and now it wont download, i want my money back. I thought it would be convenient but it turns out to take up more of my time. Not happy, it is supposed to be compatible with windows but how will i know if i can't even download it amazon i want my money back"
1,"I have a question about the ""tribe"" in this story.","Is this a story of indians in India, or Native Americans in the American Southwest? What Southwestern peoples practiced firewalking and crystal meditation? The men dive into and roll around in the hot coals while the women only have to walk over them. At one point a ""shaman"" gets ontop of a sick person in a(in as many words) sharing of ""energy"".This book should be billed as science fiction not as historical fiction."
4,Disappointed at the edit,"I love the cruisin series- I have the vinyl. When I bought the CD, I thought it would be the same as the vinyl. Unfortunately the edited out my two favorite songs- Blue Moon and Barbara Ann. It is still good, but It isn't what I expected."
2,it's a fake re-edition,"For all of you that possess the original Cruisin' LP seriesI don't recommend to buy these CD series because they are different.First of all, there are 11 songs instead of 12, the playing secuenceis different and some songs aren't even the original ones. Even ifyour LP version is scratchy (like mine)it's not worth to change itfor the clear sounding one because it's fake...Sorry"
2,Not what you expect,"You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit properly. They only fit properly for one wearing, stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry. I have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought I would try these. ""You get what you pay for"" applies to this product."
1,Horrible socks,"These socks were thin, large, and horrible. They had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently. Absolutely worthless."
5,A great book dealing with St. James Parish,"Having lived in St. James Parish for most of my life, this book gives a great look into the past. While many of the sites stated in the book have been lost in time, this book gives a look back to the eary years when this parish was a little Cajun settlement. Being black, this book has given me a link to my family's past and our cajun roots"
4,Straight from the Coon's mouth,"My family is from Cabanocey, and they touched on the various ways to spell my maiden name...which was impressive. It was helpful in identifying where my family's customs come from and how my ancestors made it to their settling grounds in St. James.This book got me interested in Genealogy, but I don't think it's a good fit for an avid researcher. It has some really interesting history about the parish, and the people, and some monumental locations.I liked it and rated it 4 stars because it opened up my eyes to my own history. If you're an outsider looking to learn more about Louisiana, perhaps this is not a good place to begin. You'd need some prior knowledge about South Louisiana, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, and St. James Parish itself. Being native helps a lot since it talks about plants located along specific highways, sugar mills that the old locals will remember, etc. It's a great book for anyone in the 10-12 corridor."
4,Fast delivery and decent quality,The item was delivered within 10 days (in Europe) and the quality was very good.So I am pleased:)!
5,Pastoring people,"I needed this book as a text for my commissioned ministry course where I am working toward certification in pastoral ministry. This was a great book and will be used as a reference book on my shelf for a long time. Anyone who needs to care for or communicate with families in a pastoral sense will benefit from this book. Also, it arrived in a very timely manner and arrived in great condition at a good cost. Thank you Amazon!"
1,c'mon,"This CD should not be offered for sale by Amazon. The original LP vinyl's were well produced. The CD is crap, some songs missing, songs mislabeled, tracks overlapping. I love this Disc Jockey and this music. This is my youth. I feel humiliated by this product.Jeff Wilkinson"
1,Don't waste your money!,Before purchasing you should listen to the samples. If you're expecting a CD of these songs you'll be surprised because of all the ads and the DJs comments. Not at all what I was expecting.
1,The Incas,I wish sellers would let buyers know when books have been highlighted. I hate to read around somebody else's annotations.
3,It is not what I expected...,"I had very high expectations for this book, and, truthfully they were not met. Although it is a ""workbook"" and helpful in that way, I did not find the actual chapters helpful. As a psych major in college, I had access to similar ""quizes,"" however it was helpful to compare my fiance and myself, which I did not have the opportunity to do in college. Plain and simple: it is cheeper than taking a course in Psych of Personality, or having a psychologist administer a psychological inventory, but if you have experienced something like this in the past, don't waste your money... Oh yah, one more thing.... If you are not religious, and don't want a book that discusses God's view of money, this is, again, not the book for you."
2,Too Religious,"I'm sure this book has good financial advice, but before I even finished looking at the first chapter I felt bombarded with biblical references and mentions of God. My fianc√© is Jewish and I am a Unitarian Universalist. This book just does not fit with our beliefs and we had hoped it would be a helpful book for all people, not just Christians."
3,American price for Chinese goods.,"I needed a straight grinder in a hurry, to finish a job. Hey look, Amazon has a Milwaukee for a fair price.The grinder worked OK.... But it was made in China. Milwaukee Electric Tool Company, Brookfield, WI, making there stuff in China.I dislike paying western world prices for equipment made with 30 cent per hour wages. The ''Nothing but Heavy Duty'' guys are off my list of potential vendors....."
4,Quality coat!,"I wasn't expecting a whole lot for $30 but the quality of this coat is fantastic! It's really great except for the shape. I'm going to return it because it looks horrible on me. The coat is very boxy. I'm 5'9, 125lbs and it gave me no shape whatsoever and the Small was very big on me. I was very disappointed it wont work."
2,Not much happens,"This is a movie that isn't good enough to watch again and was quite forgetable. I watched this movie a week ago and really can't remember a single thing about it. What I do remember is that there wasn't enough action to catch my attention, nor enough drama to make the story memorable.Below average special effects and acting highlight this forgetable fare."
4,Entertaining Teen Thriller,"The Shortcut wasn't a hardcore horror flick but then again it was a PG-13 thriller .I didn't mind that there wasn't gratuitous violence in it and I usually like a lot of gratuitous violence.The actors are appealing and the characters interesting enough to keep your attention.It's more of a mystery and that lends to it's appeal.They don't sugarcoat anything or have any less victims of violent deaths because it's PG-13 they just make you use your imagination more instead of showing you the actual kill in full effect.There are a couple of twists that I saw coming but it was still a good story and cleverly done.I think even a slasher fan ""like myself"" would enjoy this movie,I did.There is a story within a story.The back story is how the Shortcut came to be and as time goes by reveals one of the mysteries.."
2,SCOOPIE DOO,"There is an area of woods occupied by an ""old man"" through which lies ""the shortcut"". When high school students suspect their their dog was killed in the woods by the old man, they play Scooby-Doo investigators.The movie has a few flashbacks to the time of the ""old man"" growing up. The ""twist"" is exactly as expected. This might be a film for teens that liked Scooby-Doo. The characters were good, the plot might put you to sleep.Parental Guide: 1 F-bomb (WTF near end) attempted rape/grope, sex talk. No sex or nudity."
4,Interesting,"With The Shortcut you *believe* you know what's going to happen, that it's just another cliched teen horror movie, and while in some senses it is, it diverts from what you expect and prove itself by twisting itself around so that by the time the end comes...you never saw it coming. And I appreciate that in a movie."
2,Lifetime Quality Horror,"This movie was mostly boring with ineffective scares and twists. In short, the movie is about a seemingly crazy guy living on a remote farm (in the woods), and the interactions of a group of teens with this guy. While the movie was generally well done (i.e., good production values, decent acting, good camera work, etc.), it just wasn't that interesting. There were almost no scares, just more ongoing tension with kids being hunted by the old guy. The movie did present a twist at the end, but it was stupid. Is the identity of the bad guy what we think it is? The answer to this question gets addressed with a twist that really has no impact, save for one very momentary surprise. The quality of the story seemed on-par with what my wife forces me to watch on Lifetime - slow, dull and over-directed. If you are forced to watch this, it won't be your worst experience ever, but I'd highly encourage someone to rent before buying."
1,Bad,"I bought this book few months ago. Wow, I wish I did not buy it. Half of the ingredients are not local. Less than 5 recipes are real- local . The book is not worth it. 1 being worst 10 being outstanding. I give it 5"
4,Herbal Teas 101 nourishing blends,Very informative and entertaining. Wish there were a few recipes with only one or two ingredients that would make it easier for a beginner.
2,Not sure if this is the original 'Forever and Ever',"My wife loves 'Forever and Ever' so I bought it this year for Mother's day and after putting it on her face changed (not in a good way), so we went back and put on the previous 'Forever and Ever' (this I had purchased in the airport) and was the one she liked and could smell the difference in fragrace. I have seen other reviewers comment on the perfume being not the right one but never took into account that view but I got to experience it with this one. I don't know whether it is a fake perfume I got or if Dior has changed fragrance slightly in either case it was not the most pleasant experience."
4,Great Product! same as original scent!!,I loved the original forever and ever when it first came out. I searched high and low for it until they recently re-launced this product! I have to say it is exactly the same as the original and I love it! Great floral romantic scent!
3,A disappointment.,It was written in Max Beerbohm's student days. It is not up to his mature work. It is only good for a fan of Max who is making a study of him or his life.
3,Wong CDs,The Wong CDs are a good tool to use if you believe in the message the Wongs send. They have good information. Only down side is it is only CDs with no paperwork or information other than that on the CDs.
3,NEW LG BATTERY,"The battery may be new because it may of been never used before, put it was manufactured in 2006, hardly ""new"" for a battery purchased in 2012. The first charge lasted 3 days, the second lasted a week like a new battery typically last in this phone. So the jury is still out."
5,Lithium-ion replacement battery,"Not much to be said, it's a fully functional replacement battery for my cell phone. My cell phone is retro as far as cell phones are concerned (LG VX-8300), but the battery works as well as any battery could."
4,I like the Gray Spear Society books better but definitely worth reading,"I haven't felt like re-reading this one yet which is one of the criteria I use to decide how much I liked a book. Still, I liked it quite a lot and I probably will reread it at some point."
3,Slowest Trovatore I ever heard,"The looks of this video and the cast are fine, but Karajan's conducting is so slow on many of the cabalettas, it's annoying. Also, Kabaivanska is not my favorite soprano - her voice always seems to have a hard edge to it, which displeases me greatly, however many people enjoy her just fine - she is a good singer with a lot of class and she always kept herself looking nice. Placido Domingo seems a bit uncomfortable with the agonizing pace of the 'Di quella pira...', but otherwise he performs beautifully. Everything else about this video is very good, with Cappucilli and Cossotto performing flawlessly. I have three other Trovatores with Karajan conducting and this is definitely his slowest and the slowest recording of this opera I have ever heard, particularly on the cabalettas. I understand why most people give this one 5 stars, but for me, Kabaivanska takes one away and the slow pace takes away another one."
2,It's not what you think,"I have to agree with some other reviews here in that this book was a disappointment. I thought it was going to be a normal-sized book when I ordered it, but it actually took me about 20 minutes to read. Oh sure, it's attractive with lots of cute pictures, but if you're thinking like I was that it was going to give you lots of ideas on how to be a ""Hot Mama,"" forget it because it just doesn't. I received no new information, which is what I normally read for, ya know. Although I do agree with the other reviews that say it would make a great baby shower gift - it is a fun little book. But there's really nothing more to say about it except if you really must read it, you could probably get it from the library and save your money."
1,Flip Through it in Minutes,"This was more like little tidbits from magazines that had been compiled into a book. If you are looking for something light-hearted yet still gives useful information, read Vicky Iovine's ""The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy"". Thank goodness I only got this as a gift because it is not worth the money."
2,disappointing,"i think i saw this book advertised in a maternity magazine, thought it was cute, and bought it online...i just wish i had seen the actual book before purchasing. it is not what you think. it's tiny, not a normal size book. it also has a lot of nothing in it. i don't think i would even give it as a gift. sorry author!"
1,PAY ATTENTION TO REVIEWS,"My true opinion of this little thing would need to be censored. It tells you info that women should already know, pregnant or not. This was some bull. I'm a first time mom but I'm not an idiot. Don't waste your money."
2,Belly Laughs is Better,"Her idea of ""Hot"" isn't in line with mine. She suggests baring your belly and states that it's hotter to show belly skin than when you don't. Personally, a line of bulging belly showing doesn't make me feel hot. It makes me feel like my clothes have shrunk and I need to find something that fits better. I actually bought this for myself when I first got pregnant and was trying to get used to the idea. I agree with the other reviewers; there's very little substance in this book. If you are buying this as a gift or buying it as an easy segue into the maternity world, I'd suggest going forBelly Laughs: The Naked Truth about Pregnancy and Childbirthinstead. She'll tell you what's down the pike in a way that will make you laugh out loud. Now *that's* HOT."
4,Great gift !,This was a small book in size and a perfect gift for a newly pregnant friend. Just a fun light hearted book but with some good information.
1,Broke after a week,I have now had this item for a week. It is now broken. Not worth $15 for a week's use. Do not buy.
4,Haunting....,"As a previous reviewer mentioned - this book does a brilliant job of describing August in Florence. The heat is so pervasive, it is like a third character. This book starts so slowly, it almost meanders - we are ""with"" the Marshal through every step of his sweating August. It seems to gather momentem in the final third, rather like a horse race - (I read that Magdalen Nabb was a great rider). I think you have to be in the mood for a book like this - it is not going to pick you up and take you for a romp (ANOTHER horse metaphor!). You must be in a contempletive mood and take it on its own terms. You'll be rewarded!! And there are many more MArshall books to read!"
1,How not to write a mystery,"I was very disappointed with the two ""Marshal"" books that I bought. Yes, it is fun to re-visit Florence, but that is the end of the attraction. The author seems to have failed the basic class in mystery writing--developing plot and character through action. Long explanations substitute for action. I did not feel I knew the characters and did not care much about them."
2,Too Maudlin,I don't know if it's the way Lurlene McDaniel writes or not but it's really difficult to read the Dawn Rochelle series. The plot is great but as soon as you get interested in seeing what the charactors have to say the word cancer pops up. There must be at least thirty times the word was used in the first couple chapters alone. Nobody with a longterm disease talks about it every five minutes unless they were newly diagnosed and need to get used to having it. Dawn had it and is in remisson when this book starts so the author should really have given the word a rest unless it actually carried the plot along. With the counselers talking to each other and the word doing absolutely nothing to speed the plot along the whole book is laughable.
5,"Read Again, and Finally Responded","This is the 43rd time I've read this book, this being my favorite of the Dawn Rochelle series. I love this book! This is my favorite one, because Dawn is older in it, and able to understand what cancer is and how it's affected her, a whole lot better. Also, this time, you see how she's able to readily deal with the impending death of a friend, and her realization of what has to be done beforehand and how she's prepared to act afterwards."
5,A review by a teen who loved this book,"I have read all 5 of the Dawn Rochelle book and I fully enjoyed them all. I would recomend these books to any teen who loves a good cry, and/or a good storie. I would also recomd any other book by Lurlene Mcdaniel. God bless."
4,So Much To Live For Review,"I really enjoyed this book. The character,Dawn,shows courage and compassion. This book will bring hope and warmth to the heart of the readers. It is a good blend of mixed emotions such as happiness and tragedy. The book will make you appreciate everything that you have and not take things for granted."
1,The Temptations - Live!,The singers on this video are NOT the Temptations---they are Imatations at which they perform awful at imatating the Temptations' music. Not one of the singing group was part of the Temptations at the time of recording this video.Don't waste your time or money if you want to hear the REAL Temptations.
3,Good product,"This is a good item, but the $5.00 shipping for a 50 cent item was a bit overboard. I feel that a more reasonable shipping source could have been found."
2,Quality control needs to work on this product,"Drueke is a great name in chess and cribbage gear, so I bought this sight-unseen online. I was most disappointed. The mousepad style floppy board was great. The carrying bag was great. The style of the pieces was good. The problem was that the weights are not all glued in very well. There were a few that rattled around. I returned it and bought the Plastic Collectors set from House of Staunton. I'll never go back. The detail, finish, and build quality are all superb. I have other Drueke chess sets and was not disappointed. They really need to go back to their old (high) stnadards of quality control. Apparently, this is what happens when you pack up and move manufacturing to China..."
4,I'm That Woman,I am that woman in the book. I have a depressed dog. My kids are gone. And I'm on the loose. Each essay I understand completely and I'm grateful to have someone who does also put my feelings in words.
3,Purely physical,"Lots of fun and useful for physical descriptions of animal, vegetable and mineral. Not appropriate for writers looking for inspiration in abstracts, emotions or thought."
5,Another Great for Writers,I love my reference books but only if they can deliver in that time of need. This book certainly does.
2,Not as good a a thesaurus,"Perhaps useful for someone who doesn't own a thesaurus. I found his book too basic. More for children really.The title gives it a more grandiose impression, but the content is seriously lacking.Disappointed."
1,Technical: Utterly Lacking in Creative Invention,"How about this for the sole entry under ""having turned in feet: pigeon-toed""? The entire volume is filled with inanities of this type. One would have to be pretty low on the vocabulary food chain to be incapable of readily summoning to mind almost any of the synonyms listed in this book. Also, the quotations sacrifice the sublime for the politically correct, and are therefore equally lacking in excellence. Don't buy it unless you are in the lower 20% of the populace in verbal facility, for you will be wasting your money."
5,positive,"Although I haven't had an opportunity to review this yet, it arrived in a timely manner and in good condition."
4,Who played the Jazz Guitar Riffs in season 2?,"I have been watching the re-reruns on Encore Westerns. After not having seen the show for many, many years,my perspective now is the first season seemed to feature better written scripts with some degree of humor while the second seasonwas more of a let it all hang out, campy endeavor to perhaps reflect the onset of the new age, counter culture which envelopedus. Look at the outrageous, flamboyant outfits of Wolders character Eric, Smith's sideburns etc.I would really like to know who the jazz guitarist was playing those devilish riffs during the action scenes, etc, long before the fusion genre became popular. I suspect it was one of the great LA session guys around at that time, but if anyone can verify, please I would like to know."
4,Laredo TV Series,Purchased this for my wife who loves old westerns and tv series. Best price we have found for this item.
3,Laredo Complete Series a big disappointment,"In 2007 when ""The Best of Laredo: Season One"" came out - I didn't buy it - I very seldom buy a ""best of"" anything as I want complete seasons with episodes in the order they were originally seen so I can enjoy the series the same way I did when it first was aired. Eventually they released most of the episodes in multiple ""best of"" sets but I didn't but any of them because I wanted complete seasons with episodes in the order they were first aired. When the complete series came out I was excited about it and finally got it - what a disappointment - first of all it is not the complete series as the pilot episode is not included and second is the fact that these are the very same discs that were in the ""best of"" sets - the discs even have labels that say ""best of"" - so the episodes are out of order along with the missing pilot episode. How the Timeless Media Group can get away with calling this the Complete Series is a mystery to me. Very disappointing..."
2,Didn't keep me iterested,"I thought Shoeshine Girl was kind of boring. It didn't keep me interested. I thought it was rather plotless, too. I don't reccomend Shoeshine Girl."
4,Very good,Sarah Ida is mean to everyone but then she gets a job in a shoeshine stand the man she works for and she sometimes are strangers and sometimes best friends. Butwhen he gets hit by a car Sarah Ida keeps the shoe stand open then she brings the money to either his wife or to him at the hospital.Then Sarah Ida becomes good to everyone
5,Absolutley awesome!,I just finished this book and I would like to recommend it to other kids because it is the kind of book you can read over and over and over and never get tired of it. She is a little mean but she comes to her senses in the end and is generous and kind.
5,Very informative,The dvd itself is very insightful about U.S. history and on how the U.S. was founded and how it has become in the way it functions and goes into detail about secret societies.
3,Secrets of the Founding Fathers DVD,"Found some interesting throughts but was disturbed by over-dramatized production and lack of understanding of the Mason moveent AT THAT TIME. ALSO, some very disturbing mistakes! The History Channel usually does much better! But, from now on, will always question their productions.Florencemhorn@gmail.com"
1,trying to distort our history....eh!,"I am only going to say a little that says alot. The people who put this documentary together had the gaul to suggest that the american revolution was insipired by men sitting around smoking hemp, getting drunk and having relations with strange women. you commie bastages these men were on a God inspired mission and a man can not be God inspired while under the influence of mind altering substances. A person is either God inspired or drud induced there is no middle ground."
3,kinks up,I was hoping to find a hose that wouldn't so easily kink up. Even in warm weather this one does.
1,Worst hose ever,"As soon as I got the hose, I hooked it up and tried it. In addition to the horrible quality of it, it kinked in about 5 or 6 different places as soon as I turned the water on. Packed it up and sent it back."
5,Cooking at Home with America's Test Kitchen,I like how they test proof and illustrate their recipes in well displayed photos. I love country food and old time recipes. AMT staff bring back the wholesome cooking and the taste of the past.
2,Repeats,As in most books from Cooksillustrated recipes already appeared in their other publications - nothing new!
5,Scroll saw clocks,We really like the detail in the patterns and we are very satisfied with the book. We will definitly buy more of these kinds of pattern books. Thank you!
4,Hardtail,I bought the hardtail pants and I do like the way these pants fit. But I really don't like that they fade pretty quickly. I will buy them again. I buy bebe sport and I have to say their pants are pretty good they don't fades as quickly. I notice with their pants they either fit perfectly or they are too long and don't fit as good. I want to try the SO LOW pants.
4,good service,"Service was great - the yoga pant is comfortable, but a bit tight - so yes they run small"
4,"Roll Down Yoga Pant by Hard Tail (Mud, Medium)","Not sure if they are the original Hard Tail, because the material doesn't seem quite that soft as I recall. Still great fit though.Haven't washed yet, but bought brown and black and love. Great deal."
2,Absolutely Mortified,"I have been doing yoga in Hard tail pants for about 12-14 years. I love the way they fit and have bought pair after pair. Yesterday in class, I noticed that a student next to me wearing black pants did a forward fold and her pants were fairly see through. When I got home, I thought - these are not cheap pants, I am sure that I am fine but maybe I'll check. Not only could you see skin tone, you could make out every detail of the lace on my underwear. (The pants are only 6 months old.) I am absolutely mortified and won't be able to wear any of my Hard Tails ever again. If you love the Hard Tails, make sure to bend over in front of a mirror before you go in public!"
1,Too long,Way too long... Will be returning. What else can I say? They say I need more words to write a review...
5,Awesome Crusin'!,"This cd is the greatest. A trip through time, back to the good old days. I would recommend it to anyone.Hank"
3,A Great One In The Past,"Dick Biondi was one of the greatest DJ'S in the 50's and 60's. While in Buffalo almost half of the audience was his. It was listen to Biondi, or else. While in Chicago his ratings were even greater. Unfortunitely his sound does not hold up to todays standard. I have the entire Cruisin' Series and Dick Biondi is the weak link."
1,Don't buy - if you're just after the songs!,"Don't buy this cd if you're just after the songs. It's a recording of this Dick Biondi character's work as a DJ, complete with him speaking over the begining and ending of the songs - in horrible AM radio sound!"
3,Maybe for someone else ...,Wasn't what I thought it was. Interesting but incomplete in my opinion. I'll read his next one to see what happens.
1,Lightweight TV series,"OK, I was sucked in. I read all the endosements. And I thought this would be a good book.As it turns out the endorsments are from fellow show-biz people.I shudda known.This book would make a good TV series.It is lightweight and the characters are shallow and unimaganative.A 35 year old who thinks he is still in school is not cute, it is ill.And his uncle who thinks he is a sliver tounged wise-cracker, but is an Ivy-league bore.Oh yes the cleaning Lady, Lady? Yeah who am I to judge?She's just running from life, so be a hooker!And the so-called jokes in this book, bland, but I do wish I was half as clever as the author thinks he is.Later,Out"
5,Don't wait for the movie!,"I read a couple of books a month, most of them off suggestions from friends. This was recommended to me by the saleswoman at my local bookstore. Either she and I have the exact same taste or she is clairvoyant. Trememendous characters, a surprise ending and at least two out-loud laughs on every page. If they make this into a movie (which they should!), I hope they don't screw it up."
1,Big Let Down,Being a sports fan I thought I might find this interesting and funny. Boy was I wrong. Not only was it not funny but it was boring. The characters did not intrigue me they just seemed to hard to believe and the plot was even more foolish. Dont waste your time or money on this one.
2,Keep the Letterman gig!,"Okay, I gave it a shot - some funny bits but that's it. Writing a good novel is much different than writing JOKES for a comedy show. Maybe the Jewish comics(Sheft, Larry David, etc) have had their run after Seinfeld finished, let another group in!"
5,BUY THIS BOOK,"Not being a gifted writer as Mr. Scheft is I don't know how to explain what a wonderful novel he has written. I only know that the old adage ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" could not apply more. I looked at this book and saw something that looked like it would be all about sports and hookers, two things I am not much interested in and although there is a woman of the trade and sports in the novel that is not at all what this brilliant first book is about. It is about people and I was very engaged by the dynamics of their relationships. It's a book for everyone. ... and I loved it. I think you will as well - buy a copy for your friends."
1,Publishers Weekly has it right,"A stinker of a book, I finished it only because of the many favorable reviews on this site. I laughed 2 or 3 times in 256 pages, or for you mathematicians, 0.01 laughs per page. It has no character development, a weak, boring, and confused plot, unauthentic and uninteresting dialogue, and countless unfunny one-liners. Over-all, it is a downer like the Valium the protagonist is addicted to. Scheft wrote that Letterman made him much funnier than he made Letterman, and if you bother to read this book you'll agree with him in spades."
2,Disappointed,"Although it's a great looking case, quality is poor and Thermaltake was less than responsive in assisting with a resolution. There were several broken parts and rather than dismantle the entire machine, I offered to buy the parts if they would provide me with prices. Customer service never bothered to get back to me.I won't buy the Thermaltake brand again........"
4,There's more to D Train than meets the eye...,"Perhaps because Hubert Eaves III's productions were always on the cutting edge, James ""D-Train"" Williams was never recognized as agreat soulsinger. His ultra-soulful, full-of-conviction and strong and powerful yet sensitive vocals do place him in the same league as legendary R&B singers like Teddy Pendergrass, Otis Redding and Marvin Gaye. ""Thank You"", Something's On Your Mind"", ""Walk On By"" and ""Keep On"" all prove this."
3,Different but not terrible.,I have given this system a 3 star raiting because it is different from the beloved originals but it isnt terrible. The combat system is definately a revision that could have been done without but that being said everything can be changed. Just like to original series if you dont like a rule... change it. I hate the static damage/combat system so I use the old rules for that. Other than that I think things can stand on their own.The point of this review is to make the point that if there is something about the new system that you dont like ... change it. That is the beauty of the WW games. I personally mix some of the old rules into the new system and it is fine. (Why the got rid of potence I will never understand but that is a different review). So the point is if there is something you do like adapt but don't say the whole system sucks - make it better yourself.
2,Why?,"Why make this book? The ""Old"" WoD was too widely distributed, so they had to create a new version to sell. The last time White Wolf did this, at least they didn't nuke the setting and have a do-over. If you look at this book, with it's vampires' blood potency that makes them go into torpor and therefore become weaker only to awaken and repeat the process, why be afraid of elders? You might as well be afraid of someone reincarnated as a butterfly!What I think is funny is that when I talk to bookstore people, they try to sell this book as a revision. What it really amounts to is creating a market for more books.Like the book? You should check out the old ones. The bottom line is that if it was so important to ""streamline"" parts of Vampire, Werewolf, etc, that could have been a pamphlet sized companion to the 3rd edition."
1,Complete waste of money!,"This phone stopped working after a week. First, the machine would record half of a message. Next, it started combining messages from various people. Then, it just stopped recording altogether. It would play the outgoing message, and even beep, but NO MESSAGE. We forwarded all calls to our mobile and ordered a Uniden - thank goodness, no problems with that one! Don't waste your money!"
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Purchased this model 3 weeks ago, the answerer would not work. Exchanged it for another again it would not pick-up, play message or record incoming call. It will also be taken back and exchanged for a phone with caller id. Will go back to voice mail. Too bad because this model if it had operated as stated would have been easy to use. I called GE and they suggested that I mail it to them, but I don't know how long it would take them to get it back me and if it would work even thenalso I don't think I should have to pay s&h; plus ins. on a new phone that should work. I gave 1 star because the is no option for 0 stars."
1,Too many red flashing lights,I bought this phone because I wanted an answering machine with a red flashing indicator to remind me to listen for messages - because I always forget to check. They sent me a slightly different phone - because of the colour - white GE29893. It works fine and the answering function is unproblematic. Two problems - firstly there are two indicator lights which flash red - one for messages and one for calls - so everytime someone calls it starts flashing and I have to delete the call record. Of course it ends up that the thing is always flashing and I still forget to check for messages. It is also a little quiet - hard to hear the person calling - even with the volume on full. I wish I had bought a less complicated phone.
2,Phone Purchase,Phone is just O.K. The design has a flaw in the Hand Piece so that it does not hold the handpiece on the base. Just a slight movement of the base will shake the handpiece off. I would choose a different model if ever I tried to replace this phone.
2,Not great for wall mount,"The phone is difficult to wall mount, the phone cord they provide is tough to roll up behind the unit. I did not find it possible and had to buy a special 1 foot phone cord to tuck behind it. The handset is very thin at the bottom and hard to get your hand around it to pick it up. The front of the unit is curved and not great for wall mount either. I bought it because of it's small size compared to other units this one is at least an inch smaller, but I ended up returning it and still looking for a replacement. For desk it's probably ok."
1,Why do companies bother making such junk???,"We bought two of these phones for our parents and are having the same problems listed with the other reviews for this same model. And, it looks like their reviews are over a year old. Can't believe that a company would continue making, let alone selling, such a piece of junk! Just goes to show -- check for reviews *before* your purchase. Ours are going back. What's the use in having an answering machine that doesn't work?? Shame on you GE!"
2,Buy Paget's other books instead,"I'm a huge fan of Lou Paget's other books: How to Give Her Absolute Pleasure and How to be a Great Lover (my girlfriend and I have the books and the tapes). This is what led us to buy the Big O, but we were disopointed. It's pretty much a rush job that seems to be a repeat of her last two books. Most of the same information is repeated, but phrased differently. It also dosen't cater to male orgasmims much at all. It's more of a guide for women in doing their part to help their man orgasim as opposed to helping men cultivate their own. Paget has a lot to teach and she has helped our sex life a lot, but this book wasn't all it was cracked up to be. If you've read her last two books and want to learn more, perhaps another writer with a different approach would be refreshing. But make sure you get her other two books first!"
4,What your momma should have told you,I only wish I had had this book when I was younger but even at 68 it has improved my life.
4,A pretty complete guide to orgasms,"Lou Paget has written a lot of good sex books - this one will appeal to almost anyone interested in having or giving orgasms. She presents a wide variety of avenues to orgasm - just about any practice you can imagine can take some people over the top.The Big O doesn't go into much depth, and is a little short on emotional and psychological issues, in my opinion. But it's kinky enough and clear enough to give almost anyone some good ideas.David Spero RN, author of The Art of Getting Well (Hunter House 2002) and Diabetes: Sugar-coated Crisis (New Society 2006), both available on Amazon."
1,Poorly written,Very poorly written. Doesn't give any info on having orgasms. Only talks about theories and studies. Waste of money. :-(
2,Not great.,"This book is really poorly written. It feels like it was slapped together without much editing, which sucks considering it starts out talking about what an expert the author is because she's read so much and is so deeply interested in the field. The ""historical fact"" injected everywhere are extremely annoying. Some of them aren't even fact, or historical.Beyond that, I found it to be a little sexist, and incredibly inconsistent. It also felt like the author couldn't figure out who the target audience is. It talks to you like a beginner who's never had an orgasm or masturbated then BAM, suddenly we've moved on to anal sex and toys. It just feels all wrong.I considered giving it one star, but maybe it's not a total throw away? It seems like if you don't take all the nonsense to heart maybe you could get something out of it? I guess. But honestly, I wouldn't bother. I'm sure you can do better than this."
3,Ok mystery,"Somewhat predictable outcome. A few twists to keep you guessing, but not very believable. The writing... grammar etc....is fine, which is not true of a lot of more modern writers, but the plot is lacking."
4,On the borderline,"I've owned this CD for many years. Part III of the involuntary songs is a layered collection of laughter, which Johnson plays with and accompanies with various instruments. It always brings a laugh from me - I can't help it.All the pieces are on the border between found sounds and improvised spontaneity, between pop and advant-garde, and between story telling and avoidance of story telling. It reminds me more of Steve Reich's pieces (where he brings forward the natural melodies and rhythms of speech) than of any other composer."
3,3 stars but I would still recommend it,"Boguslaw Linda saves the whole thing, but the movie could have been a lot better. Some characters are cardboard, like Linda's new woman, some plot twists standard and hurried, and the ending is a completely unoriginal stale cliche from hollywood. The movie could use another 20 minutes to get some depth.One of the authentic things is that Russians and Ukraininans are played by Russian and Ukrainian actors respectively, and their lines are anything but cliche. Valeriy Prijomyhow (R.I.P)is great as usual. Of course, part of vodka-balalaika folklore could not be avoided, but it is not distracting."
5,Great Cover,"I was looking at The Strokes' Myspace page today see what songs they had posted, and there was a song called Mercy Mercy Me I didn't recognize. Marvin Gaye's original didn't even come to mind when I read the title, I was just trying to think which album it was off, haha. These guys did a great job though. I bought the single at lunch off iTunes so I could have it for work for the rest of the day.I love Pearl Jam so it made this song that much better having Eddie Vedder on vocals. Josh Homme is also in this song (lead man for Q.O.T.S.A.) and Queens of the Stone Age is another of my favorite groups. I didn't notice Josh's voice in this one though, he might've just been helping out on the guitar, which he's been known to do. Anyways, awesome cover, makes the single worth buying."
5,great cover song...great music video!,"I really don't like cover songs but this one was really great. The strokes did their magic once again. Music Video for "" You only live Once"" was really cool, loved Julian's little dance."
5,Reliable pistol,"This is a very good pistol. It is very reliable, powerful, good for a beginner, and it has never jammed for me. The only bad thing about it is that it gets dirty often. So get a pipe cleaner or something. The clip holds 12 rounds, not 14."
3,Acrlic Jewerly Case,"The item arrived with scratches that may or may not be expected on an acrylic surface; however, they were not glaring enough to return the item. The item was shipped VERY poorly, only protected on the top/bottom. All four sides of the box were caved in and ripped when the case arrived. I was surprised there was not extensive damage. If you order this case from this company, request proper shipping. The item also took longer than the specified time to arrive (perhaps because the shipping was free)."
2,Too Technical?,"You bet! There is far too much focus on the science through technical jargon and brain charts and not nearly enough on practical advice. The advice that is there is solid and easy to implement, but you really have to hunt for it. Overall, the book is average. THere are far better books out there."
2,not impressed,I was disapoined and not agreedable with a lot that was said in this book. I have ADD the Inattentive type. I just could not grasp it.
1,"Safe, is it really?","In page xvii of the introduction, Dr. Amen writes ""Stimulant medications such as Adderall, Ritalin, or Dexedrine are among the safest and most effective medications in psychiatry"". That sounds reassuring until you read the article in Medical News Today (August 22, 2006) mentioning that ""Dexedrine and Ritalin are drugs used to treat ADHD. The FDA announced changes to their labels, and possibly those of some other ADHD drugs, to include a warning of a risk of heart problems and psychotic behavior"". That is not reassuring at all. This book is writing in an authoritative style - sort of the bible of ADHD, the book that tells you what it is, and how to go about it. The only problem is that it is flawed."
3,Book condition review,I have purchased many books via Amazon that were sold as used in good condition and all of the books were pristine. This book was in poor condition with many markings. I was very disappointed in the condition of the book.
4,A Good Start,"Through his groundbreaking research Dr. Amen, a well-respected psychiatrist, demonstrates that ADD/ADHD is a neurological disorder, which can be positively identified using brain imaging. Although some experts in the field may take exception to his characterization of different ADD/ADHD sub-types (since we have always identified many of those sub-types as co morbid disorders existing with ADD), he makes a valuable contribution to our understanding and therefore treatment of ADD/ADHD. Surprisingly, by identifying each of the sub-types, he makes medication recommendations, which have been used by many doctors for years, they just never called it what Dr. Amen does. A good read for struggling parents of ADD/ADHD kids who are not responding to standard stimulant medications and those wishing broader and more diverse knowledge of the field.Ali Hashemian, Ph.D."
5,"On par with ""Driven to Distraction""","This book should be as helpful as ""Driven to Distraction"", if not more so. The author is empathic to ADD sufferers (some people with ADD really do suffer, and so do the people around them). In addition, he writes from extensive clinical experience.With this book, you can evaluate yourself or someone else; you can read numerous case studies; and you can learn what might help you succeed in spite of ADD. Amen offers a balanced view of therapy, including traditional and alternative methods which he has personally seen to be effective. Besides telling what you should eat and swallow (appropriate food and medicine), he tells you how you can practice thinking so that ADD doesn't hinder your enjoyment of life.A hopeful and encouraging book. It made me wish I could bring my whole family to his clinic."
5,INTERESTING,"Easy reading book, but If Your on wefare it will not pay fortreatment of ADD and it can cost 2000 to 5000 dollars forservices a year. Book could of coverd a few of the govermentprograms that do cove ADD."
5,Finally some help!,"This book has helped us turn a corner to finally getting an accurate diagnosis and some REAL help! My son has struggled in school (and at home with chores and such) for years. We've seen four professionals who all agreed he suffers from high anxiety. However, after months and months of counseling/therapy and years now of extreme struggle with school(he's 13), I was not satisfied with the diagnosis and started doing my own research. I stumbled up on this book and the more I read, the more I wondered if the author had met my son! I did my homework too and researched the author/doctor. Sure, there are the critics out there but from what I've researched, Dr. Amen seems to know what he's talking about. He's even been a guest on the Dr. Phil Show umpteen times, which for me, helped his endorsement. Even just reading the random few pages available to sample on Amazon.com was enough for me to invest in this very enlightening book!"
1,BLAH!,"I was VERY disapointed with this book!! It has entirely too many of his patients stories. (Long stories) I don't want a book with ""case stories""...I want a book to help me learn about ADD/ADHD and what I can do for my son. This book describes the 6 types of ADD, but where's the ""healing"" part?! This book was an ENORMOUS LET DOWN for me! If you're considering buying this book, I recommend going to the library or a bookstore where you can ""look over"" the book before you actually buy it. You may be glad you did!!"
5,valuable for adults or kids with mental problems,"Pioneering MD who has revolutionized care of ADD sufferers, has written easily understood guide to types and treatment of ADD and ADHD. Incudes self diagnostic questionaire, comments on medications, images of brain, diet suggestions. Worthwhile book."
4,a good book for a first step.,"well organised, this book explains about add, symptoms, and responses to the symptoms. the first step for someone who seek answers."
2,If I had a hammer...,"I really liked ""Change Your Brain, Change Your Life"" and therefore expected to like this book, too. Amen's advances in brain scans promise significant insight into mental disorders. Unfortunately, in this book, he reminds me of the proverbial fellow who has just gotten a shiny new hammer and suddenly sees nails everywhere. In his view, it seems, nearly every possible mental disorder really is a form of ADD. This contradicts the usual psychiatric protocols for differential diagnosis: ADD is generally defined as an attention-directing and impulse-control disorder that does NOT involve delusions, depression, bipolar, and other problems known to have attention-deficiency and/or impulse control components. Thus this book seems likely to confuse the diagnostic issues. I still expect Daniel Amen to produce a great book on ADD one of these days, based on the brain scan research. I regret to say, however, this isn't it."
5,ADD explained,"Although I have not completely finished reading Healing ADD, it is an excellent source for figuring out if you or someone you know has ADD and for understanding how the brain of someone with ADD works differently and that there are many different types of treatment depending on the type of ADD and a person's reaction to the type of treatment or medication."
5,Heal yourself with Dr. Amens' book.,"Regaining my life is work in progress and Dr Amens' ""Healing A.D.D. ...Program."" is the advice I have searched and craved for since school days when I was called ""Semi"" for semi-conscious. Fifty years or so ago, when I was school-age, no-one knew this affliction was a physical impairment of the brain neurons. A recommendation from a veteran Adult Attention Deficit Disorder survivor, like myself, could be all one needs to kick-start recovery to a functional member of society, no matter what one has suffered in the meantime. Salutations and grateful thanks to the survivors that contributed to Dr. Amens' """"Healing A.D.D. ...Program."" The ripples that were sent out from this knowledge are still spreading. This knowledge is blessing to all who are touched by this affliction. AND it is easy to read. Enjoy your learning journey. My sincere thanks to Dr. Amen."
4,very interesting book,I purchased this book for a gift for my sisterto help her with her children who have ADD. I did glance thru very interesting book.
1,this man is a snake oil salesman,"i am a psychiatrist in the bay area. i have seen many patients who have been taken to the cleaners by this man. he is taking snippets of science and feeding back a gumbo of non-useful information to vulnerable patients and familes. he charges exorbitant fees for work-ups that are superfluous and then makes vague, all-encompassing recommendations. he does none of the treatment himself. he is a charlatan. do not buy this book and add to the fortune of this dangerous man."
2,More descriptive than healing,"I love Dr Amen. He is a great speaker, I love his message and I had a lot of hopes for this book for myself and my child.However, this book is more geared to helping you 'understand' the 6 types of ADD and only gives a basic foundation of what each category needs to 'heal'. There is very little on 'healing' unless you count, go to your doctor and get these meds. It only has a a page or two (if you are lucky) on healing.Again it does explain the various forms of ADD which is very helpful but does not offer much on 'healing'.If you are medical professional this may be very useful, for a parent, this is more foundational info not a 'go-to' book."
2,The game freezes on my ps2,"I love guncom games, and judge dredd has very good visuals.. but the game continuously freezes up on my ps2. Thus, I can't give it a good rating.Does it run alright on the ps1?"
4,Real Talent! Real art!,"This is a great starter if you're getting into the Stones Throw record label and Peanut Butter Wolf! My brother recommended me to listen to some J Dilla and Peanut Butter Wolf on YouTube and I was hooked. The music CD is great and has such a variety of what Stones Throw offers: Gary Wilson, Lootpack, Charizma, Madvillian, Dudley Perkins! The DVD then takes it a step further and you can visually see the creativity these guys have! True artistry!These guys enjoy what they do, you can hear it in the music.This is still one of my favorites that I purchased back in 2006, it only took me 7 years to write a review about it (Sorry). Do yourself a favor and buy some real hip-hop that's underground and not on the radio! Real music! Real artists! Real talent!"
1,Didn't work at all,I should've guessed that this wouldn't work d/t the price. Never could even get the thing to turn on... don't waste your time or money!
3,Came Out Defective,Mine came out defective from the wire you have to move it around if you want it to work.Im pretty dissapointed because of that defectiveness.
3,"Build quality's a little ""meh,"" but it's a winner otherwise","First off, the negative: build quality's pretty bad. Speakers feel very flimsy and cheap. The one I got has a battery cover that won't stay on. Not very well built.But the audio quality is fine. I bought them because the built-in speakers on my laptop were awful, and I wanted better audio for when I'm working in the studio. They're not ""good for $2,"" they're just good speakers. Not incredible, but good enough. The USB power cable was a very nice addition as well, since it makes using them as replacement laptop speakers much nicer without having to buy AAA batteries constantly."
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,"I read the reviews and almost didn't order this. But then I figured $2 and some change with free shipping....go for it! I wanted speakers to play my IPOD in the bathroom. The sound is awesome! It is loud enough for me to play in the bathroom and walk arond my bedroom and into my walk-in closet and still hear it! For $2 and change you can't beat this at all! I am going to order one for my kitchen. And for my daughter and son want too! Considering what I was going to spend this is definitely a steal, ummmm i mean deal!"
1,Piece of Junk,"Very, very cheap manufacturing. I bought this for my mother for her birthday, but when we opened it and attempted to use it, it didn't work. The battery panel was broken/not installed properly and the metal connectors wouldn't even stay in place long enough for you to try to put the batteries in.I was very, very disappointed, especially since I had bought it ahead of time for her birthday, and by the time I gave it to her it was too late to return it. True, it may not be very expensive, but it was still $15-16 down the toilet for no good reason. Not all these may be defective, but if you're thinking of getting one, be aware that you're playing a bit of russian roulette with the results."
4,Very good value for the price,"I bought these to listen to my Creative Zen in the car. Besides the bargain price, the sound quality and the construction are very good. The player comes with a USB power cable. I plug this into my USB to car power adapter, eliminating the need for batteries. The Zen fits perfectly in the holder. Even though it fell a few times from the dashboard since I hadn't secured it properly, it still works without any problem."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE SPEAKERS,These quit woking 5 days after I bought them. I should have khown better because they were such a cheap price.It would cost more to return them so I just threw them away. If i could give 0 stars I would.
1,"The WORST, tinniest speakers I've ever heard","Simply said, listing to your earphones lying on your desk, with the iPod volume turned up high is better quality sound than these speakers provide!"
5,good music quality,The only thing I'm not satisfied is that the length of of the speaker wire is too short.
3,Great for office space,"These speakers are great for office space where you have to keep the noice to a bare minimum. The product is not very sturdy, but again, for the price, you can't beat it. It's very lame that CTA Digital doesn't include the AC adapter. I had to purchase one separate so that I could plug it in in my office. Batteries are too expensive to be replacing every week."
1,didnt work,"I bought this, it looked nice when I opened it and I really wanted to see how it works. The speakers did not even work. It seems as if the makers put more money on making it look like it will work rather than making it work."
4,:) :),as of now i have been using this for a few times and it works perfectly fine... the connecting wire could have been little more long..but worth for the price..
5,"Small in Size, NOT in Sound!","These speakers are tiny and adorable, but they BLAST the music like no one's business! It folds up for easy portability and sets up with a snap - the only complaint I can come up with would be the amount of time it works in one go... I was working on an outdoor project and was listening to the better part of five hours and the speakers started to crackle around the fourth hour. BUT the first four hours were golden and after a short rest (thirty minutes or so) the speakers were right back at it! Highly recommended especially for the price!!!"
3,Works for me,"There are some pretty harsh reviews of the product out there. Sounds to me like people who wanted filet mignon for the price of a hot dog. Consider what you want from this item before you buy it. I got it primarily to listen to audio books on Playaway (they are becoming very common in libraries and are a great improvement on books on cassette or cd. check them out, seriously) and they suit my purpose fine. Is the sound quality great? No. For $6.00 speakers I didn't expect it to be. What I wanted from this product was for it to play my Playback so that I could listen to it without earbuds, and that's what I got. If you want to hear some tunes or a book while you're washing the dishes or sorting the laundry, these speakers will do it for you. If you want a transendental music experience then you should know better than to even consider them. They are a terrible steak, but a perfectly good hot dog."
3,Nice design but took a little effort to get it to work,"I was excited to receive the product and was looking for something affordable compared to what is out there.I like the speakers, except for when I received them, it seemed like there was some sort of corrosion on the adapter that plugs into the headphone jack of the iPod. When I plugged it in, the sound was scratchy, like the connection was bad.I scratched off the corrosion with a metal tool, and then they worked."
3,OK I guess,It is louder than the batteryless speakers i bought but they give a lot of distortion. not great but they are ok.
4,Nice speakers to keep in your bag.,"I didn't expect much from these for their price, but just wanted some small speakers to listen to my ipod in the park without having to use earphones. The volume, clarity and sound on these really surprised me. Don't expect Bose, but don't expect junk either. They fold into a nice small square that protects the speakers from other stuff in your bag. My 30g Ipod fit with some extra room in case I have it's protective skin on it. I experimented with my old walkman cd player plugged into it and the sound was still great. Overall I give these little goodies a thumbs up."
1,do not buy,"I'm about to head to Australia for a year so i needed buy some portable speakers. I came across these, which no one ANYWHERE online had yet reviewed - so i had no idea what to expect.and i guess i figured out why no one had reviewed them... because the rest of the world is smarted than me and didn't buy them!they ARE compact. and they ARE light. and they ARE easy to set up. but their sound is HORRIBLE. my music sounds so so muffled and i can't turn it up very loud. so frustrating.huge let down."
4,Super Value,"I had no high expectations for these speakers; just something small and portable that can be used in place of headphones in a hotel room on the road. For the price, they are impressive sounding. Very crisp and clear with low distortion, thanks to the use of the small aluminum drivers. They're not loud, but they are very clear and even have a hint of bass that make it worth the price. The universal stereo miniplug input makes it useful for anything from old school walkman tape players to ipods. You could easily spend A LOT MORE to accomplish the same thing. Great little speakers!"
5,Worth the money!,"I bought these speakers, so I could listen to my ipod in my room without it being hooked up to my laptop. These speakers work wonderful, just make sure to turn the ipod all the way up, then the speakers. I found an adapter that allows me to plug the speakers into the wall. The only gripe I have, is that the stand for the ipod is designed for an ipod without a case. Mine has a case, so I can not place the ipod in the holder."
1,Do not buy.,Besides the expensive price of this set the sound quality is horrendous. At least two of the songs (including Blinded By The Light) are badly edited versions and not the full ones played on the radio. Do not waste your money on this garbage like I did. I would love to have a decent box set from these guys.
3,Fun stuff,I guess I can't think as fast as I should. As the levels go up it gets a lot harder to match the numbers and colors. It's a lot of fun but hard to keep up!
1,Not a very good one,"I love everything about Australia, so I would definitely want to check out this novel. But the scenario was way too simple - they met and they fell in love - and that's all. It's not that kind of book that's worth staying up late just reading it."
3,not bad,"works ok, mouse pad rest is somewhat reversible, but if you have a tall chair at your desk you may need to exchange it for a shorter one. It hangs lower than I expected, but slides smoothly and has a handy little compartment under the wrist rest. This product won't work with unusually shaped keyboards, just the standard rectangle ones."
3,good with problems,This keyboard is very nice and easy to work with but the installation is very difficult. The screws provided are too short for any substantial mounting.
3,Good product -- great company,"Very nice product from a reliable company. Happy with everything I've bought from Klein's. Actually prefer other glazing over these honey glazed though, but this product is good."
5,Great - yes! Historically Accurate - not,"If you can accept the fact that this recording was not made in the 1950s, there is nothing bad that can be said about this CD. Despite his age, Porky tries very hard to sound like his former self, but a careful ear will hear him trying to avoid having his dentures fall out. Kinda like Don Adams still trying to do his Maxwell Smart voice in commercials and cartoons. A little imagination and you are back listening to a composite of Porky's shows in the '50s. And the music is great!"
3,"Cute, sturdy but tiny.","I think this is a nice rake but it is made for a child so small that if they are that tiny they probably won't be raking. However, that doesn't stop my 4 year old (really tall for his age, 45"") from trying. So if you have a small child, it would be worth it."
3,Non Fiction,"Ian Stafford is an average bloke. Just like most of the rest of us, he is not very good at any particular sport. In this interesting book, he travels the world as a writer, setting up sessions with highly successful sports teams and groups to see what it is like to be them, even when not having their talent."
2,Was good in 1985,"Today, albums like this sound outdating, repetitive and crap. I would agree with the 5 star reveiwer if we were still in 1985. Nowadays this kind of music is naff."
3,"Older cartoon, not what I expected","My daughter loves Raggedy Ann. I have purchased several books that she throughly enjoys. Due to the low price, I purchased this video. The video has 3 cartoons. The first one features Raggedy Ann. This is an old cartoon probably made in the 40's or 50's by the creator of Raggedy Ann-- John G. The cartoon is about how Raggedy Ann helps a blind girl ""see"" through her imagination. This cartoon is simply wonderful!! Unfortunately, the next two cartoons are not so great and do not feature Raggedy Ann. The second one is about a fair and the third one sounds like it is dubbed."
3,Powerful prose and raw talent shine through...,"I picked this book up on the recommendation of a friend in Seattle. As I read it, I kept thinking ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" and also ""Homeboy"", although I can't put my finger on exactly why. Perhaps because I so entered the main character's somewhat dark and brooding world, which is a tribute to the author. Perhaps the way the author bowls over the reader with a raw talent that is evident in the aforementioned works. Then again the novel is held back by seemingly endless talking heads type dumping of dialogue, which seems to be a common thread in the current flood of print on demand books like this one. But this book merits at least 3 stars for its reference to the actress Julie Newmar as ""Catwoman"" in connection with the main character's earliest sexual experiences- ""purrrfect!"""
2,Deeply disappointed,"Blair Witch meets the love child of King Kong and Jimmy Durante.I really wanted to like this. I didn't mind the shaky cam bit that much, nor the mocumantary style. I just thought it was way too slow, and the jokes got old rather fast. I nodded out for a few minutes in the middle. The effects weren't bad, and the scenery was quite good, but not good enough to carry the movie.As a side note, the subtitles were some of the worst I've ever seen. Quite a bit of talking would go on and then maybe a 4 or 5 word sentence would eventually appear. I ended up switching to the dubbed version, which is something I almost never do, but I was clearly missing out on a lot of banter."
1,Stupid,The dumbest movie I have ever seen. I think I actually lost brain cells watching this movie. Waste of time
4,"Not as great as hyped, but still worth the purchase","Although the movie isn't as great as all the hype, it is still a great movie. It was worth the price especially for a blu-ray. I enjoyed the troll hunter character immensely and an interesting take on the found-footage genre. The CG is really well done and the quality of the video is top notch. The only problems I had with the blu-ray itself is the few number of bonus features. It merely had 3 deleted scenes, and the concept art reels, while interesting, should have been a lot longer. The amount of troll concepts they exhibit seems like they didn't give it a lot of thought. Great movie, but lacks bonus content."
4,Great Comedy!,"Can't believe some people take this movie seriously! Just go in expecting a fun, uniqaue experience. the titile delivers on what it promises."
3,Enjoyable,"My family enjoyed this movie, but that was probably because we are mainly scandinavians(Norway / Swedish) and I have been read my kids stories about trolls for years. People from the southern counties might think this is a bit dorky."
5,Excellent Friday Night Movie,"Filmed in the style of Blair Witch Project with some very well done CG. If you can get past the English subtitles and Norwegian dialogue, this is a very entertaining movie. Some gore, suspense, and graphic creature violence. I mean they are trolls for goodness sakes. Honest to goodness bone grinding trolls, who can smell the blood of a Christian-man. If I recall correctly one goat, one man, two bears and at least two trolls meet their demise. I wouldn't show this to young children. Reserve this for Jr High and older. My boys 12 & 15 really enjoyed this even though they were put off by the subtitles at first. SPOILER: At the very end of the movie there is some very well edited real news video of the Prime Minister of Norway (the movie fails to ID him though) explaining that the high tension power lines in northern Norway are necessary for troll control."
5,Wow,Surprisingly good! When the film started I thought it would be horrible. But overtime it got better and better. Trust me. This film is worth watching.
5,Great entertainment!!!,The Troll Hunter is a fun flick to catch. No acting or special effects awards here but fun and entertaining to watch. That's what movies are for. It's better then most movies you'll see at the theaters today. Check it out:)
3,not the worst movie ever,"The idea of this movie is interesting, these college kids are following someone they think is a bear poacher, um no, that's not what he does and they find that out. The man decides to let them follow and film him. I gotta say some of this movie in the beginning is boring, takes awhile to get started but over all it wasn't a bad film, it wasn't gory, so if you gore hounds out there are looking for it, this isn't it, but the movie has a story so if you're a fan of that then check it out."
4,The Blair Troll,"I gave it four - but that was a positive four. My spouse hated it, but she hates Paranomal Activity one and two and ""Blair"" - all movies like that. I don't mind them and the mock rammifications of this sort of ""documentary gone wrong"" style actually helps the storyline. Nutshell - I just thought it was a very fun film, will re-watch often, and I was VERY impressed with the Troll designs on a smaller (I assume?)budget - I rented first, watched twice, and bought it for my home collection as it was a film I'll drop in now and again for some just plain good old entertainment."
4,Different,Pretty unique it was like anything I had seen previously. We need more movies like this. All this big budget garbage
5,I don't know how they could improve it.,"This was the perfect (troll) movie. Dry humor, great characters, excellently acted, plenty-good special effects, and beautiful cinematography. I'm going to watch it again tonight if I can make the 48 hour window."
5,Good Flick!,"This movie was really good. A different take on the ""creature movie"", courtesy of Scandinavia. Appreciate it for the differences that make it refreshing. The trolls are pretty damn cool. We need more movies like this in america. A breath of fresh (and entertaining) air!"
3,If your xpecting a ton of action then your going to be dissapointed,"I rented this a while back from netflix and i was kinda expecting a ton of action but was pretty disappointed when i had to not only read subs but wait like almost an hour for a damn troll.the real movie starts like an hour in, the trolls start to pop out and the action picks up, overall the film was good but in my opinion i wouldn't buy it."
3,Very Blair Witch Project-like,"Interesting idea, decent special effects. Though it reminds me of theThe Blair Witch Project, which I did not much like.Very clever ending though."
5,Fun movie!,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit! I watched it after seeing Dead Snow, another Norwegian film. Enjoyable plot and surprisingly good effects."
4,"Not your standard Sci-Fi Channel fare, much better","The digital rental was a little steep ($9.99 US) for pre-release. But the it was a good movie. The CGI was much better than I expected, it was often done as through the lens of a hand camera, or at night, but much much better than what you would normally see on a Sci-Fi channel movie.The movie was sub-titled, which is a minus for me but the story was good. Most of the movie and action is done with a shaky handy cam documentary style (with lots of running involved) If those make you nauseous this movie is not for you.The story played out like a modern day Brothers Grimm style fairy tale, about a jaded giant-slayer followed by three college journalists looking into a bear poaching story.The hero spilling bits of wisdom to this biographers regarding troll ecology, physiology, and mythology, after each near death encounter."
4,Trolling,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I set down to watch this film.'Found lost tapes' style movies are hit or miss with me, and this definitely qualifies as a lost tapes movie. The camera work is wobbly as expected but not so much as to make you queasy (Blair Witch and Cloverfield...). The premise is fun: a student film crew investigating bear poaching instead find a man with an unusual profession. While the characters don't really develop and there is not a speedy-fast plot, I still enjoyed myself a great deal more than I expected I would. The CGI effects are very nicely integrated and definitely give the movie a feeling of quality production value.I wouldn't call this movie horror but it is definitely fun. As an added bonus you get to see parts of the world you normally would not. I guess I have to wait until the August dvd release to see it again."
4,A Fun Ride,"It's just great entertainment, some dry humor, and some action.I had a great time watching it.It seems clever while not taking itself serously.Well worth the time if your in the mood to be entertained."
4,On board with the Troll hunter Guy,We all really enjoyed this film - lots of fun from the start - and we certainly have never seen a film about this Topic - the Troll hunter actor did a great job and really sold us that he was the man - and the kids did a great job convincing us that they were really on this story - lots of adventure and mystery - good story and great trolls - lots of Fun - a must see
1,5 stars - are you kidding?!,"I'm amazed this movie would receive a serious 5 star rating from anyone. I found it amateurishly done and with nothing at all noteworthy regarding the writing. The whole story could have been told in 30-45 minutes but was instead stretched out, without any merit, to 2 hours. It's a complete waste of time."
1,Troll Hunter,It wasn't what I thought! The trolls where different but the acting was really bad! If u like really chessey movies have at her!
2,Fake as Blair Witch Project,"This is a hoax with great effects. They claim to have a real documentation of ""Trolls"" and they can sniff out any God fearing Christian man... Just like ""Blair Witch"" this is all the same. Fake with poor acting."
1,los idiomas y subtitulos no coinciden,"No es el mismo que pedi, el que anuncian trae subtitulos en espa√±ol y el que enviaron no, actualicen la informacion por favor."
3,Might have been good,This might have been a good movie except that I missed a lot of it reading the subtitles. That seriously detracted from the experience.
2,"Boring movie, think blair witch project, but about a troll.","Boring movie, think blair witch project, but about a troll. Nothing original, not interesting. The plot, what plot? It seems more of a weekend camera projet than a movie."
3,Halloween Treat,"Good for children who like spooky movies a b rating for 8 and over, a toddler may cry seeing such huge ugly beasts."
2,"A fake documentary, not a movie at all","The ""movie"" started out at the very beginning with text claiming that these hours of tape were sent to a studio anonymously and that experts had spent a year trying to determine if they were genuine or not--concluding that they were genuine. How stupid. This was not a movie at all but was a fake documentary. If you are a science fiction fan (as I am) but also don't mind watching shows about bigfoot you might like this. But I couldn't stand it. If I'm going to watch a documentary I would kind of like for it to be real."
2,Not up to the hype.,"I typically like this type of movie and I had heard good reviews of this one. I was not impressed. In fact, the only thing I liked about this movie was the scenery. The rest was, in my opinion, poorly written. The dialogue was just plain dumb at times, feeling very unnatural. I wanted to like it more."
5,Pretty neat film,It inst a classic but I enjoyed it. I thought it was unique and worth the fare price. I recommend it. Its a sleeper hit.
5,What a hoot!,"More films should be this enjoyable. I really appreciated its abandon, and its integrity. It's like a good roller-coaster - diverting, exciting and a fantasy fulfilled. Unplug your expectations, and just enjoy the ride. It's great."
4,Well beyond expectations...,"I'm not going to say anything other than Troll Hunter (which is a Norwegian film w/ English subtitles) was a blind purchase, based on some strong reviews, and as an end result was absolutely spot on. While not a perfect film (hence 4 stars), Troll Hunter proved an excellent genre film, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I suppose the best compliment I can offer is that it's not often I hope a movie will not end. That said... Kudos to Magnet Releasing for an excellent blu-ray transfer, and if your like me, and have only ever peripherally heard of Troll Hunter, and have even the slightest inclination towards escapist fantasy cinema (in this case an amusing hybrid of LotR's, Blair Witch, and Spinal Tap), etc, buy Troll Hunter with confidence! Enjoy!"
2,I wanted to like it--but it was boring.,"I missed seeing this film in theaters and was disappointed but after seeing it on DVD, I was REALLY disappointed. It was long and boring.I enjoyed the scenes with trolls but they are in, at most, 10% of the movie. The other 90% of the movie was talking -- mostly unimportant jabber. You can skip through most of the dialogue in the second half of the movie and you wouldn't have missed anything important. The movie just dragged. Some of the explanations about the life and death of trolls were well thought out but cohesively the whole story was a chore to sit through.The 'lost tapes' idea is tiresome. With Blair Witch, at least it had a strong element of fear. Paranormal Activity had that AND some comedy sprinkled throughout. Troll Hunter was just blah and overrated."
4,Surprised me,"I was searching for a streaming movie to watch and came across this one and started it thinking we'd just watch it for a few minutes to laugh because I was figuring it had to be super-cheesy given the title, but it really surprised me. It was a fun, well-acted movie that kept our attention start to finish. Lots of action and the trolls were very well done. We ended up buying it."
1,Not recommend for parents of an OCD child,This book is out-dated and contains a lot of mis information. This book tends to blame parents for OCD and does not begin to mention the chemical imbalance that is now known to be a cause of OCD.
1,review of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder,The author of this book clearly does not understand the basis concepts of OCDs. It is troubling that someone with such little knowledge would publish a book on a very important topic. The premise that OCDs have stemmed from something other than a chemical imbalance is ridiculous and untrue. This book should not have been published nor read by anyone with OCDs.
5,Great book! Very useful!,"I bought this book recently and thought it was really great -- very useful. My aging parents live in South Florida and I wasn't happy with the info I was getting from them about my father's condition -- He's 80, with heart disease and arthritis. Since I used the NY edition myself, I bought a copy of the Florida edition -- and found an excellent cardiologist who recommended a good arthritis specialist. Now I feel alot better about what's going on with their health. I recommend this book to other -- particularly those in my situation -- needing to find reliable medical advice for parents in Florida when they live some where else!"
1,Beware of how Doctors are chosen in books such as these!,"How Doctors are chosen is the real barometer of this books integrity.......As one with a personally distressing visit with one of the Doctors listed, who ironically told me to stay off the Internet and don't do so much reading, I feel these books do NOT deliver. Get referrals from health care workers, such as RN's, technicians, etc., who see the Doctors at work everyday and KNOW who to avoid and who to recommend. Ask ER personnel, anyone at a facility in whom you come in contact. It's the best method for uncovering the best Doctors."
4,Nice one ( except software ),"I bought this one aorund 2 months back. Overall it is good, and the clarity is good. Little bit noise in lowlight indoors ( with backlight on..it is OK). And it is very easy to handle, only the zoon button should be somewhere on top...it is kept to handle by middle finger which I am not used to. The great drawback is the software, which has no capability of burn to a DVD. These days, how can they give a software without that facility, then I used third party softwares for that. Otherwise its a coool one."
2,Panasonic PV-GS300 3.1 MP 3CCD MiniDV Camcorder,"A disappointment. I purchased this camcorder thinking that, with its 3CCD format, it would be an improvement on the camcorder I already have. Not so; my Sony 3.1MP 1CCD MiniDV camcorder I purchased several years ago produces video and stills of much better resolution, and of more realistic color. I have returned the Panasonic."
5,Marieann...my cousin the Star,"This CD is one of the best CD's I've ever listened to! And I'm not saying that because Marieann is my cousin either. She's a talanted singer who's worked so hard at her career and deserves all the happiness in the world. I'm sure you'll all love this CD as much as I do! I listen to it every single day and I never get tired of it either. She has that kind of a voice that you'd want to listen to all of the time. Anyway, buy her CD you'll be amazed! :)"
1,Don't buy it,"I grew up on Buffy Sainte-Marie. I bought this to hear her again. A lot of the cuts are really second rate and disapointing, for instance this version of Piney Wood Hills is awful compared to what you can hear on her album ""Many a Mile"". Also, this best of mixes periods which just don't go together at all. Try to get her original recordings. Not all of them are available on Amazon, there is an Italian distributor you can find on Google."
4,"i hate giving it a ""4"", because BUFFY HERSELF is a ""5""","there are some truly wonderful songs on here, but the compilation also puts on a lot of schloc. almost all of her later work, i feel, is terrible - all her synthetic stuff, ick! and there's a fair amount of it on here. i've owned this album (in record form) for five or six years, and there are just some songs NOT WORTH EVER LISTENING TO.now, all that said, for the wonderful songs on here, the ones with buffy and a guitar (and sometimes with her bass player), they are just wonderful, truly a powerful musical and emotional experience. universal soldier is up there with the best of em, as in ""now that the buffalo's gone"" and ""my country tis of thy people you're dying"" and ""many a mile."" buffy is raw power, and don't be fooled, she's one hell of a talented musician as well, highly sophisticated both in voice and on guitar.she's raw woman, raw human, just raw! (but that later stuff, god, what was she thinking?)"
5,Breathtaking !,"ALL of Buffy's music is wonderful... old, new, in-between...She is unique and one-of-a-kind...A master !!!"
5,"dying to hear it, cannot get it here","I heard this lady sing quiet a few years ago, from my father, who was a singer too, and loved her music. Ever since then I have tryed to track her music now but failled up untill now, great"
3,wellcome home Buffy!,"Was so glaed to see amazon had Buffy on CD, but what gives? Only one listed?! Come on! I've been enjoying her singing since the 60's! You'd think Amazom could have more than ONE!!"
3,Watch the expiration!,I bought several boxes of this product and realized that it expires in less than a year since my purchase date.
2,Disappointing Results,"This product is probably ok for the person who just wants to transfer VHS tapes to DVDs for use on their computer. However, I was unable to get any DVD made by this system to run satisfactorily on any DVD player I tried besides my computer's DVD drive. In addition, a complex installation and registration system made it practically impossible to reload the software in the event of a computer crash. My recommendation would be to save your money."
5,Easy to use!,"Although I am not a techno-geek, I was able to quickly transfer content from VHS to DVD and audio tapes to CD.One note: if you are a Windows VISTA user like I am, you will first need to go to the Honest Technology website [...] and download a software patch. Otherwise, the audio in your CD or DVD will be ""staticy"" in places.Other than that, this product is very easy to use! Worth every penny if you want to easily transfer audio tapes to CD or VHS tapes to DVD using ""point and click"" menus."
3,VHS to DVD,So far I have not been pleased with the video capture. The copy that is captured skips and the end product is roughly 2/3s the original record time (and I'm recording from a digital source). The audio capture feature seems to work fine.
1,"Hardware OK, Software sucks","The hardware works ok, but the software is lacking, the documentation not helpful and the support is non-existent."
4,Honest Technology - VHS to DVD 3.0 Delux,Happy with product. Easy to use. Pretty much as described in the product literature.
3,vhs to dvd 3.0 deluxe,"I bought this program after much research for copying my old vhs tape collection to dvd format and the product has done an adequate job of copying for me however, I find the instructions to be somewhat incomplete. I have had questions about setup for certain dvd copying that I feel a FAQ page, if included, in the instruction manual would help me, as well as others, with using this program. All in all it has done a very good job of making copys of my vhs collection but doesn't seem to work, though it states it is compatable with, dvd dl discs. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't have movies that go over 2 hours in length as if you get into dl discs you will be somewhat disappointed with its lack of instructions as to how to make those copys."
1,Did not work at all,"This goofy software installed as a ""trial version"" only and constantly prompted me with nag screens to register after I'd already done so. After several attempts at installing, it only gave the ""repair"" option. Finally, after launching the ""trial version"" and getting a window to open, it didn't recognize the USB device and prompted me to install what it would not install.fuggeddaboutit...."
4,great tool for old vhs movies,I've been using this for about a month and almost finished converting to DVD's ...the only complaint I have is that we needed to purchase a blue ray DVD player...would not play on a regular DVD player...very distorted
4,"Easy to use, but slow","Produces very good quality DVD's and it is very easy to use. My only complaint is that it takes up to 3 hiours to transfer a 2 hour VHS tape. I just set it and forget it but my kids complain that I'm hogging the computer. I've been trying to transfer 4 or 5 per weekend. We have 20 years worth of tapes to get through and with five kids, thats a lot of tapes. It also offers limited editing features. I'd recommend this product for anyone wanting to preserve their personal memories sitting on VHS."
1,"Difficult to install correctly, crashes constantly","I had high hopes for this product as I have a huge mountain of VHS tapes that are quickly becoming useless. I had problems installing this product from the start. After the first try, the device would not capture any video, simply stating ""unable to start recording"". After unistalling and reinstalling with software patches and driver updates per honestech's website the device did begin to capture video only to crash after a few minutes of recording. I uninstalled and reinstalled several times to no avail. Every time it would crash the computer (which exceeded minimum system requirements) so bad I had to perform a hard reboot to unlock the system. I got nowhere with this product and agree that perhaps it was released too soon. Very disappointing..."
3,Ignore previous review,"For the record..Dolly never has said her worst single is ""Potential New Boyfriend""...the previous reviewer is not telling the truth."
1,Absolute Garbage,"I bought the 15-minute charger and lots of extra batteries to go with it. After the first couple of charges, each and every one of the batteries was useless."
1,Crappiest NiMH battery ever owned,"I bought a bunch of these from another website: Snnoop.com. They charged fine in my La Crosse LCD charger. However, like the prior user said, upon use, they discharge really fast. I used it on my Sangean portable radio. With Alkaline, a set can last me months. With these, they last maybe a day or two. And they claim this is 800mAh. I call BS.Do no buy them. Go for another brand."
2,The power will be discahrged soon,You have to recharge it every 4 days even the battery is never used.
4,OK,"My Duracell 15 minute charger consistently has problems charging these batteries, but my Maha Powerex MH-C800S (a great charger, by the way) charges them without problems. I ran them through a ""condition"" cycle on the Powerex, and that seemed to help them out. I have a feeling that the inventory that's being shipped out has been sitting in the warehouse for a while, and perhaps that's the source of some of the problems that people are having."
4,Aaa nimh batteries,Adorama took seven or eight days from date of order to day they shipped. Other than that great deal. Batteries working well. Package a states 500 charge cycles which is more realistic compared to the 1000 I have seen on some nimh
3,For Disneyphiles and History Buffs,"This hasn't been released yet, but any potential purchasers should be aware of what they are getting. Like the ""Alice"" comedies on the ""Disney Rarities"" disk, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit is interesting for Disney fans because he is rare and historic, not because they are great cartoons. (In much the same way that Steamboat Willie is 'great' because it's the first Mickey and the first cartoon with synchronized sound but is not ... objectively a great cartoon.) I've seen a few of the Oswald cartoons and they are NOT really very good. Storylines are basic in the extreme, animation is crude, and characterization non-existant. But, if you are one of those Disneyphiles or History buffs (like me), I'm sure you'll buy this set anyway! If you're looking for sophisticated and entertaining cartoons that you'll be able to watch over and over again, save your money."
3,UB IWERKS created Mickey Mouse - not Walt!,"The description for this item is WRONG - Ub Iwerks created Mickey Mouse. Even then Walt mostly directed and found talent, he was the businessman and a genius at finding talent but Ub was the creative force behind the early studio. He rejoined Disney studios later too. Ub Iwerks absolutely created Mickey Mouse, NOT Walt Disney and shame on the Amazon reviewer for stating that Walt created Mickey. It isn't true."
1,Not as nice as it appears,This watch is cheap and was such a disappointment to my husband. I received it a few days before Christmas and had no choice but to wrap it up and give it to him. I paid way too much for this item. I wouldn't buy something like this online again.
4,Lucy fun for everyone!,"This game is really great. It keeps the whole family entertained for hours and hours and hours. You can play many many times before getting bored of it. Not really educational, this game provides more fun for people over the age of 11. This game requires a basic knowledge of I Love Lucy so I recommend that players have seen I Love Lucy. This game is fun for Lucy afficionato and people who have only seen the show once or twice. Lucy-tastic!"
2,Lacking in Imagination!,"I held high hopes for this boardgame, as I'm quite a Lucy Fan. Yet this game is so ho-hum. Constant giving or grabbing character cards that do nothing...moving up the board is the only real action on this game. No real predicaments, strategizing required...and the only luck you want is to finish up the game fast. It's a Y-A-W-N! If you really Love Lucy and collect all her stuff, that's the only reason to buy this game."
5,Encourages the child's imagination!,"What I liked about this story, is that it is based on a true story and it is a good introduction to a child about the once standing, Twin Towers. The story itself encourages a child to think outside of the square - and it also takes a child's mind away from anything technological - it feeds a romantic imagination. I gave this book to a friend's son(aged 5) - and it is his most favourite book - even 3 years later! He also shares it with his cousin. Surrounded by 2 dimensional technology, sex and violent filled movies and tv, this story is a breath of fresh air to any child's imagination! Also love the illustrations!"
4,Book about Philippe Petit's trip on a high wire between the twin towers,"Honestly, if the title alone doesn't catch your attention, nothing will.This book walks a fine line (no pun) between serious and fun, and just manages to hit the right notes every time. I firmly recommend it."
4,A Four Star Book,"I really enjoyed the book "" The Man Who Walked Between The Towers."" It had a great plot and I think it would be easy for little children to understand. The book probably wouldn't ever happen in real life. The illustrations were very good and described the book very well. I think the pictures were some type of pastel colors which looked very flowing. Overall I enjoyed the book."
3,Inspiration and comittment can help you reach you goals,This book also had a good meaning the author used a true store y to inspire.The story is abour a man who is a performer and wanted to walk beteen the two towers.So he did something about it he snuck on one of the towers thre a rope to the other one and walked a tightrope for a long time but he was really wanting to do that and so he went for his dream
4,Great Tribute,"I recently stumbled upon this book from it's Caldecott Award. Once I read it I was amazed, I had no idea someone had done this. This book is a wonderful tribute to The World Trade Center. The books character, Philippe, knew he would get into trouble but was determined to balance himself to walk between the two massive towers. He had done this before in his home of Paris at the Notre Dame Cathedral and was so excited about using his talent in New York. The author, Mordicai Gerstein, has written many other childrens books. A few of these where: What Charlie Heard a Gold Award Winner, Wild Boy an ALA notable children's book and Victor which the New York Times reported as one of the top ten children's book for 1998. The Man Who Walked Between The Towers is a great book and would be excellent used in the classroom or in the home."
1,Kindle edition doesn't download (Aug 2012),Beware. Kindle edition results in a error upon download as of 18 August 2012. I returned the book. Sad. I hope this gets rectified so my child can experience this wondrous book.
5,Mesmerizing,"I have read this book numerous times to numerous groups, young and old. It never fails to capture and retain their attention. The illustrations are rich, warm, and inviting, with just enough text on each page to describe the action. The fact that it's a true story makes it all the more enjoyable!"
5,The Hire Wire Act Over the World Trade Center,"This is a wonderful story of Philippe Petit and his walk between the Twin Tower of the World Trade Center. It is done in a very moving way and the story is truly touching. I can't believe he did it! Since the towers are no more, the story is even more eloquent."
4,excellent entertaining recreation of the walk,"My Dad was enthralled for days as i read him the story of phillipe petit's planning and execution of the walk between the towers .. remarkable story . highly recommend it for any agesPut this together with ""Walk in the Clouds' by phillipe Petit as it fills in some spaces -- unfortunately there are discrepancies and i choose to believe Phillipes account ."
5,My Students LOVED This Book!,"I'm a special education resource teacher who works with struggling readers in small groups. I recently read ""The Man Who Walked Between the Towers"" as an instructional read-aloud to one group. They were absolutely fascinated, and these fifth and sixth graders who have reading difficulty were so engrossed in the story of Philippe Petit. They asked wonderful questions and eagerly tore into a post-reading writing assignment. The illustrations in this book, also by the author, are awe-inspiring. I can't recommend this book highly enough; it's fantastic and one of the best additions to my classroom library in a long time."
2,A stylish lady's story.,"JACKIE STYLE is a book filled with the life of Jackie Onassis, an out of the ordinary experience that most mortals can only read about in the tabloids and imagine what it must be like to have been ""Jackie"" ... and with some really good photographs and a lot of commentary from today's designers and tastemakers, Jackie Style is a worthwhile book if you like Jackie ... which I do."
1,"ho hum, ho hum, how do you make an interesting life so dull?","Every story you've ever heard before...every picture you've ever seen before, with a couple of make up tips and advice to buy Valentino couture if you want to look like Jackie? Please, at $45.00 give me a break.There are dozens of other Jackie books and they all have the same five pieces of information and the same five quotes and they just mush them all around all the time and it gets really borning...So, my recommendation, don't waste your time and money on this very predictable retelling of an often told tale."
1,"Qu'elle ""Rip Off""...","Reading Jackie Style, which is what I did with great anticipation as I loved Audrey Style, left me sadly disappointed. The story of Jacqueline Kennedy has been told many times and this is a cut and paste job of most of the stories that have been out in public circulation for years and years. Then there are a bunch of magazine style features about Jackie's makeup (and how to duplicate it), her closet (and how to buy them) and how the many photographers who took the millions of pictures about her took them. It's sad, dull and offers nothing in the way of illuminating this most interesting personality.I don't recommend this book."
5,JackieStyle,"I loved this book. After reading numerous books and articles on Jackie Kennedy Onassis, it is refreshing to read a book which is complete, and not sensationalistic. It is imbued with the writer's sense of humor, insights and competent research. Keogh is always respectful of her subject. I found this to be a fun read which will certainly be enjoyed by many people. Wouldn't it be great if more people had one tenth the style JKO had? Keogh shows just how this style can be accessable to many women. I just hope it's still on the shelf this December, It would make a great Christmas present. However it is a book that just about anyone would like to receive for any occasion."
1,Disappointing--Not up to the Standards of AudreyStyle,"If ever there were a perfect ""second installment"" to the series begun with AudreyStyle a book on Jackie Kennedy would seem to be it. Unfortunately I have to agree with other reviewers that this is a far too wordy rehash of Jackie's life with inferior photos. I cannot recommend."
2,A nice effort...but.....,"Jackie Style is a nice try to portray the American woman of the century as a style maven and great influence of style and fashion. But it doesn't really do that successfully. It's a little silly and uneven. But there are a couple of nice stories and some really pretty pictures. The price is way high, however, given what's out there in the Jackie book market."
5,Picture Perfect Life of a Great Lady,"""Jackie Style"" is a wonderful overview of this amazing first lady who seems to be everywhere you turn these days. Loaded with gorgeous pictures that capture all facets of her life, ""Jackie Style"" was well worth the price paid. I'd recommend Keogh's tome to anyone enthralled by this woman and her amazing style."
5,"A Beautiful, evocative book","Jackie Style is a delicious follow up to Ms. Keogh's first book, Audrey Style. She does such a lovely job of evoking time and place and how history can be read in the pages of what a first lady wears. Some of the pictures were new to me and quite wonderful to see. A great pleasure to leaf through!"
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE - VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I was really looking forward to this book, as I loved the author's book on Audrey Hepburn, but this is a really silly retelling of the Jackie Kennedy Onassis saga...Jackie was an interesting and vital person, and this book makes her appear to be vapid and dull: or maybe it's is just the book which is vapid and dull. ... Some of the photographs are interesting, but most of them aren't.There are a lot of times where the writer makes up what Jackie and John F. Kennedy were thinking at some moment years and years ago. How would anyone know what they were thinking? It's very disrespectful to the memory of a beautiful lady."
1,Too little book for the money.....,"At the price I paid for this book, I expected a large format coffee table book, but what I got was barely 250 pages of a regular biography, although highly designed and with a fair amount of pictures (some good, some bad). There's really nothing wrong with this book except the cost should be about half of what it is in terms of what you get for the money.The writer puts herself into Jackie's mind and pretends to know what Jackie Kennedy was thinking when people took her photograph or when she had guests to dinner. It's not biography, it's not journalism, it's sort of ""Faction"" half fact, half fiction. The writing style is bitchy and silly, but not too bad.Shame on whoever priced this book."
3,Good and interesting book,"This is a interesting book about JKO, but certainly not the best on the shelves. Keogh makes to many shallow assumptions throughout but, the reader can feel that the author maintains respect for JKO. It is also interesting how she decribes JKO's interior designing style, which I loved. She even has pictures of JKO's dressing room in the White House and her drawing room at 1040 Fifth Avenue, which is a VERY beautiful room. Keogh encompasses many aspects of JKO's style, her love of literature and art, and most of all- her family. A good read, worth the price."
5,nice !!,"This is an english remake of ""Dhoom Machale,"" but it is done so well that I think it's better than the original Indian!"
4,"Finally, the phrases you wanted to know how to say.","While very far from an instruction-type foreign language book, this slim volume provides a useful and entertaining selection of colloquial phrases in Arabic. Sections include greetings, parties, cursing, arguing, dating, and sex. Some of the latter are quite explicit. Some of the phrases come with helpful notes on cultural standards regarding their usage. My only criticisms might be that the pronunciation guide is not very complete, and the grammar notes at the beginning are too brief."
3,Interesting,"I would recommend this product because of its new approach in teaching the different aspects of life with regards to language use. However, in the chapters where normal day to day conversation is used, formal Arabic phrases were given when non formal should have been used.Overall it is a book worth exploring though."
1,Good for a laugh,"This book is a complete waste of money, time, and the paper it is printed on. As a previous reviewer said, if you utter any of the phrases this book recommends in an Arabic speaking country you will be at best not understood, and at worst you may give serious offense. The vocabulary and pronunciation this book offers are from modern standard arabic, which is not something spoken in normal conversation, much less in the intimate situations this book attempts to provide vocabulary for. In short, save your money."
5,WONDERFUL,"This is a wonderful informative book!!! Anyone on the path that is searching for enlightenment, would appreciate this book. The few that would say that it is "" mumbo jumbo "" one would have to ask WHY DID YOU BUY IT THEN??? I would suggest this book to those who are wise enough to handle learning about enlightenment..... I give Lia 2 thumbs up!"
1,Tries to ride the wave of popularity of the Pleiadian series,"This is the very first review I have ever written but I felt it important. I was so excited to read another Pleiadian book after the impact that ""Bringers of the Dawn,"" and ""Family of Light"" had on me that as soon as I got my copy I started reading it. Page after page of enticements that we were going to learn something wonderful and it just fizzled! The whole book could have been condensed into a couple of pages of lukewarm information that is not only not new but is condescending in its delivery. What a waste of money!!"
1,"The phrase ""mumbo-jumbo"" comes to mind","The fact that so many reviewers have given this piece of New Age garbage 4 or 5 stars makes me sad for the future of mankind. Barbara Marciniak was bad enough, claiming to be the messenger of some ""spiritual"" (which is here, as always, rather loosely defined) race from an obscure star cluster, but at least she gets points for originality. Everyone looking seriously to buy this book would be better off spending their time and money on something by Richard Dawkins, Michael Shermer, or Carl Sagan, because they obviously need a serious lesson in skepticism. Come on, people, use your common sense."
5,I must say...,"The delivery was very slow, but I cannot say that either the company or the product was bad. I got a speedy reply from the company with great customer service in the end and I am happy to have done business with them. The dictionary itself is a great have for physicists or want-to-be physicists. Great have, great company."
5,Good quality at a decent price,I shopped around for medicine balls at a number of different retailers. This is a quality medicine ball at an excellent price.
4,"It Ain't Heavy, It's My Blubber",Came just in time to help with my workout. Good grasp on ball that is sure to build muscle if used regularly. Good price.
1,perfect size,"3rd type of ball that I purchased. When I received them, it was perfect ball for the excersize video that I am doing. Very Happy with the purchase."
4,Good product,"I got this ball because another brand didn't have the higher weight. The only thing about this brand/ball compared to the Valeo is this has a bit less grip. It doesn't feel slippery, but it does not have the surface feel of the Valeo. With those when you grab the ball you won't drop it, with this one it takes slightly more concentration.Otherwise fantastic product."
4,All you need and more,"Like the other books of the Schaum's Outline series, ""Theory and Problems of Set Theory and Related Topics"" provides you with hundreds of problems, which have been worked out step by step, to show you how the theory works. This is similar to a professor in college showing you the problems on the board, but these don't get erased and are much more legible.In addition to the solved problems, there are supplementary problems to test your understanding of the material. At the end of each chapter, the answers are printed for you to check your work.The discussions of set theory include definitions to ensure that you are familiar with the lingo. There are also plenty of examples to illustrate the author's meaning. With all the information on set theory, there are also chapters on quantifiers, boolean algebra, logical reasoning, and the algebra of propositions.This book provides some good assistance in learning set theory."
4,Well presented with excellent problems!,"The material is well presented with numerous problems that drive home the concepts in the book. The reader must be a little careful as there a few errors in the Problem Solutions though. Overall, this is an excellent text."
4,"Good Introduction, Mor of a Tool","I used this book in a Mathematical Logic course, and I found it helpful when giving examples for Set Theory. It was definitely easy to follow, but we didn't really reference it that often. However, I wouldn't look at it on it's own, but then again it says it's an outline so I doubt one would mistake it for a text book. It's a decent guide to set theory, especially for people who aren't that into math. There are better books out there for people who want to go further."
1,Anything featuring Sharmyn McCraw is a disservice,"to the Cushing's community. Not only is Ms. McGraw admittedly uncured, but she is only out to hype herself, not do service to anyone but herself."
2,Let down.,"I loved Buffy Sainte-Marie's Best Vol. 1 and had high expectations for Vol.2 Unfortunately, her choice of songs left much to be desired. Except for ""Welcome Emigrante"", which was a great song, most of the other songs were overpowered by the music, drowning out much of Buffy's singing. I am a Buffy Sainte-Marie fan and, on the whole, I was disappointed with Vol. 2."
4,Unique and sometimes haunting,"Buffy has a very distinctive style. Her rendition of ""Lyke Wake Dirge"" is very haunting and creepy!"
1,Motorola Battery,"The battery doesn't work nor fit properly in the phone, therefor I am unable to use it at all."
4,Laura Ingalls Wilder,This book is very informative and has a great chronology for those doing reports on Laura Ingalls Wilder.
4,Good stuff!,"This is a delicious product, but not my favorite in the Emerald nuts line. It is very sweet compared to some of the others."
5,Yummy snack for those on the go!,"Emerald Butter Toffee-Glazed Walnuts not only taste delicious, and are good for you, they are easy to take on the go, in their foil zip lock bag. Always fresh and not too sweet, instead of eating junk food, I am eating a healthy snack. I keep a bag by my computerwhen I want to treat myself!"
2,Quality is poor,"It was surprisingly hard to find a Barney toy. At least this one looked like Barney. Two problems: the material is of very poor quality. We never even used it in the bathtub and in two weeks it lost its look completely. Also the outfit is sewed to the body, you cannot take it off. I do not recommend this toy."
4,Good Read,This was a very interesting book. I did sometimes find myself day dreaming when reading his pr & wr times. I'm sure the times would be more interesting to a swimmer as I am not. But overall I thought this was a really good book.
1,Dreadful,Started swimming a bit and taking notice of athletes... this one is a bore. Boy starts swimming. Boy is great from the start. Boy gets gold.Whoopty doo..
2,Big Star...not Big Read,"I agree this Michael seems a bit young to have already written an autobiography. The book was not exactly a ""page-turner"""
3,"Enjoyable, if a bit shallow","Beneath the Surface is the autobiography of a 19 year old. As such, it is interesting, but also shows a great deal of youthful enthusiasm, and immature writing. He skips around a lot, and never develops his topics fully. I found it very difficult to keep track of people as he jumped from name to name. I did really enjoy the insights he gave into his family, and I loved reading the descriptions of his races. Certainly, this is a book worth reading, but get it from the library unless you are a big Phelps fan. Meanwhile, I'm waiting for the book he publishes in 10 years when he has grown up some."
5,A Must Read for Any Swimmer or Parent,"Although this book leaves swim training to the coaches, this book offers the incredible journey of Michael Phelps from childhood swimming to the 2004 Olympics. As a college swimmer, it was a relief to read about his training and see similarities with my own.He offers lessons for life that are necessary for any young athlete. Phelps had help writing the book, but his words and experiences are still there. This man has been through a great deal and it is incredible to read of his sacrifice in the name of achieving greatness.It is written simply and easy to read. Inspirational and any athlete can relate. I love this book."
2,Nothing short of triple-X 70's porn,"To get myself siked for the release of ""Death Proof"" on DVD I get hooked by this tantalizing offer: bikers, sex, violence, complete debauchery. I put it on and quickly realize (much to my surprise) it's no more and no less than straight hard-core porno! Not the most nasty porno (aka- no anal) but still full penetration and everything leading up to it. And, I mean hey, I'm as down with porn as the next cat but it's not what I was in store for, and it's not like I'm gonna sit and watch a whole porn movie front to back. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna find the best parts, squeeze one off and put it away till the next time I'm feelin' randy.So in lieu of reviewing the quality of the porn itself I'll just say that it has its' charm but don't expect even the most meager plot outside of: ""let's go here and bone"" and after that, ""let's go in this other room and bone.""P.S. The ultra-gritty aesthetic is something to be admired."
4,The Dyer's Companion- Bemiss,"A really neat book of old-timey (1806) recipes for dying cloth, yarn, leather, etc. All terms and procedures are explained in the back of the book, but the ""receipts"" are just as they were way back when.Good detail. Herbs and chemicals to get the colors you want. Home remedies too! A fascination! Marlene"
5,cream of onion soup,"Campbell's Cream of Onion Soup is hard to find, so I ordered a dozen cans and used them all during a winter. I don't ever consume it a soup. I use it to make a wonderful gravy for porkchops. Pork chops can dry out so quickly, and this takes care of the problem and adds great flavor. I usually brown them in a pan, then add the can of soup with about a third of a can of milk then scrape the good browning pieces at the bottom of the pan and mix in the pan. It makes a wonderful, hearty golden-brown gravy in which to simmer chops. The pork is moist and falls apart with a fork. Great gravy for potatoes too."
5,Cream of Onion Soup,"How can anyone make certain casseroles or gravy without Campbell's Cream of Onion soup? When stores in my area stopped stocking it, I drove to other areas to fetch some cans. Yummy pork, chicken and vegetable casseroles are especially tasty from using it. Finally I decided it was a lot easier to have a case directly shipped to the every now and then. Amazon made it happen and in another month or so I will no doubt order cream of onion soup again."
1,not good folk,"maybe good for weaver fans, but frankly i think of the weavers as sellouts to pop music. if you want good lee hays or pete seeger, listen to the almanac singers, where they at least have woody guthrie."
5,One of my Top Favorites,"I bought this CD because I have the vinyl album and this has truly been one of the very favorite albums I ever owned. The Weavers have an infectious joy in their singing that I've not heard anywhere else; I tap my feet and sing along and have joy with it also! Seeing the PBS special on them makes it even more special when I know their history and their impressive role in folk music. This is the ""real stuff."""
3,Still the old magic,"I would have given this review 5 stars because the Weavers are the Weavers and these are such wonderful songs. My only disappointment is that I'm afraid I've grown accustomed to the big sound of modern recordings and I wish there were some way they could boost the sound of this one. I suppose several tracks is too much to ask for, but it sounds a bit two-dimensional."

4,"Enjoyable overall, but with a few flaws ...","15 battles of the Civil War, some well known, others not. I found the book a little slow in the opening couple of chapters and admit to being a little confused at times as to who was who, due to the high level of detail on those commanding the battles at all levels. However I soon settled into what became an easy and enjoyable read. The book gives a good flavour of what the ordinary soldier felt and experienced during some of these mindless assaults, and also of the incompetence at (particularly) middle command levels. My main complaint with the book is with the 15th chapter where the author appears to have ""invented"" some conversations (looked for sources, couldn't find any) which are so verbose as to border on the unbelievable. However, this aside, I recommend it as an enjoyable reading experience."
3,Didn't get far...,I didn't get far with The Kabbalah of the Soul though I was interested in a potential psychology of Kabbalah. There are more helpful books out there IMO. Daniel Matt is probably the author I'd recommend most.
2,Kabbalah of the soul,"This work lacks content.The author compensates her lack of authentic Kabbalic tradition by inventing her own terminology,she reminds me of that other bluffer A.E.Waite.Leet repeatedly quotes yogic philosophy and classical philosophers far more than she does Kabbalists to back up her points.Despite her lengthy commentary,theres not much substance here.When the author tells the story of an indian mystic who runs his hand through sand and transforms it into a ruby.....and than goes on to say that its actually captured on film,well you can take it from there.Godzilla destroyed tokyo on film too,or was it japan?"
4,Good read,"I am a soon be stepmom and wanted a little extra advice, I'm currently working my way through the book but so far so good. I would recommend this to any stepmom."
2,"it's a start, but better packaging needed","i've enjoy the 2005 - 2007 installments in these collections. however, the nudity in cashback was unfortunate. the problem with these collections is they mix PG and R rated material. i know there's not a strong demand for these releases, but i think the demand is growing with the awareness of the quality involved in the productions and the storytelling. if it's not economical to seperate these oscar notmiated (and additional) short works into PG and R packaging, these DVDs should be rated R. it's unfortunate though as most of the work is inspiring to younger viewers. fuddy duddy at work."
4,Here are the titles,Here are the titles:Live ActionAusreisser (The Runaway) - Ulrike Grote (German)Cashback - Sean EllisThe Last Farm - Runar Runarsson (Icelandic)Our Time is Up - Rob PearlsteinSix Shooter - Martin McDonagh - ACAD AWARD WINNERAnimatedBadgered - Sharon ColmanThe Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation - John Canemaker - ACAD AWARD WINNERThe Mysterious Geographic Explorations of Jasper Morello - Anthony LucasBonus Short FeaturesThe Fan and the Flower - Bill PlymptonImago - Cedric Babouche (French)
5,Great collection!,"I mainly bought this for the ""Jasper Morello"" animated short, but there's some nice surprises on here as well. Besides this compilation, I was only able to find ""Jasper Morello"" by itself for $25. & over. So, at $12. or so, this was a steal. There's other great material on here, but ""Jasper"" is worth the money alone! Grab it!!!"
5,Blue Cosmos,Very cerebral and serene -- very suitable for meditation and out-of-body excursions into the vastness of interstellar space
2,Nice Pictures,"This is a coffee table book , Very over sized . I am very disappointed in this book . The pictures are great but few and no to little information is given on the pictures or the subject .. The variety is small and the picture take up whole page and often two pages for one picture which is fine but not as interesting as you would expect . a better book is "" The Stars and Stripes "" by Boleslaw and Mastai as it is a larger collection and more varies ."
1,"""Long May It Wave""","It is hard to see why the authors of ""Long May She Wave"" chose to burden it with a title that not only parades a demeaning stereotype misrepresenting objects as female, but rudely misquotes the words of our national anthem to do so. A check of the Smithsonian Institution's excellent web page on the history of the Star Spangled Banner and the drafting and publication of the National Anthem confirms that no one associated with the flag or the anthem ever referred to it as ""she"" as this book title so insultingly does. In documents from those patriots who made the famous banner, used it in battle, preserved it for posterity, and memorialized it in the inspiring poem that became our national anthem, the flag is sensibly termed it, not the coy and historically false ""she"" invented by the authors of this book. Since the the title signalled the authors' disregard for historical accuracy, I left it on the display shelf unopened."
4,Lots of information but hard to navigate,"This book is packed chock-full of information, but its strength is also its weakness. The dense text is good for those who want detailed information, but is harder to flip through and to use for quick planning or decisions. Most useful for those who may be in Prague for a longer period and want in-depth information. The restaurant and accommodation listings are helpful."
2,You will need!,"I spent a lot of money in shipping cost's finding a good ECG book! Nothing impressive about this book, which is why I sent it back. Don't be fooled by the title! You will to find another book if you want to understand ECG's."
2,Mediocre,"This book is meant for people in medical school. It may actually be less advanced then Dubin. I may be biased there as I used Dubin in medical school and then everything was new. If you have gone through a basic book then this may be a waste of your time and money. It doesnot deal in depth with arrhythmias, or with T wave inversions or the use of vector EKG which may help in tight spots."
2,Nice but uncomfortable,Im giving these to my sister.I got these for outings and parties and I looked real good in them.A guy came over and asked me for a kiss. I like them but they just hurt too much.I think I'll save them for my younger sister.
4,Love the look!,"I love how these shoes look, but I hate the way my feet feel the next day. They are so comfortable throughout the day, but the next day, the balls of my feet ache. I still wear them though!"
3,The Tirpitz,I found that the book was incomplete for a book on the Tirpitz. The assumption was that I would have read the book on the Bismarck. I wanted to know about life on board as well as the chronicle of the attacks on the Tirpitz which I was well aware of. The book read very well and was very detailed in its accounts. I was disappointed in the content.
4,Non-Fiction Video Scriptwriting,"There are hundreds of books about writing screenplays, but few designed for non-fiction video production. Hampe hits the mark with this book designed for writers and producers of information videos.He covers research, treatments, script styles and the business of scriptwriting, as the title suggests. Inside are several different script examples, a production glossary and such tips as thinking in pictures and writing for the spoken word.This is a definitive reference book for corporate and instructional script writers--concise and to the point. The only downsides are that it doesn't address writing for the documentary; it is more ""commercial"" oriented. It also is skimpy about computer programs for scriptwriting. Other than that, this is the book to get whether you are writing a corporate training video, a travel video, a TV commercial or any special interest film."
2,Jilly's got some good recipies here,"JIll gave me her recipies for Prime rib,Yorkshire puddin, mushrooms, brussles spurouts, Pasta melonaze and others years ago and they are a staple in my home.I gotta get her book before it is too late."
5,Great for Mazdas,Mazda calls for 70W-80 gear oil which is a non standard weight and not many people make it. It is an improvement over the stock fluid. It is not a huge difference but the shifts are a little smoother and take less effort. But a worth while investment if you are going to change your gear oil. Also this is full synthetic and will protect better for longer than your standard oil.
5,RED LINE RULES,"Red line makes one of the best oils in the world, no doubt about it, i used this MTL in a 2004 VOLVO S40 T4 manual gearbox (M56) to replace the volvo factory fluid; im very pleased with the results, i did a complete research to find the best product for my M56 gearbox, and i think i emailed the red line people and came up with this suggestion, i gave it a try (crossing fingers) and it works perfectly i must say."
2,Absolutely Disappointing,"I played the first dark reign and its expansion and got hours and hours of enjoyment, espically the humorous, rebel traning missions, however dark reign 2 just doesn't cut for me.I think the 3D environment is a bit distasteful and the game maps are generally cluttered with useless obstacles. Units move too slow, buildings take up too much map real estate, and resource run dry to quickly.There however one redeeming quality about the game I enjoy very much and that is the music.Don't spend your money on this one, stick with the first dark reign."
2,the first dark reign is cheaper,"you could easily be equally entertained by any game from the past decade as you could by this game. There is nothing new or exciting (alright i have to admit that techno music really gets me into the commonly abused post-apocalyptic theme of genetically engineered superhumans killing each other with ""blasters"";""rail guns"",etc.) But the graphics are nice. And um, the textures are decent, and can easily be viewed with that nifty camera. But when you actually play, there is nothing to do, but use the same old tactics from starcraft or dark reign or whatever. I did have fun with those snipers though =]"
4,As good as I remember it,"I had played this game years ago when it first came out, but since had moved and lost my CD. For a while now I had the urge to play again. There are not many games out there that allow such a simple thing as building fences or walls around your base, yet that is the main reason I fall back to this game from time to time."
5,Beautiful artwork,"This is a great book with beautiful artwork. I especially like the ark being built with a double page rendition of the ark's framework, giving small children the visual of the enormity of its size."
5,NOAH'S ARK,"GREAT BOOK! I LOVE THE ILLUSTRATIONS OF JERRY PINKEY NORMALLY, AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED BY THIS BOOK! THIS IS A BOOK I WILL BE GETTING FOR MY SISTER WHEN SHE HAS HER LITTLE ONE!"
4,Noise From Sweden,"If you don't know these works but like the symphonies of Kurt Atterberg, you may like these as well. (Both composers are omitted from all mention in latest Penguin Guide, which should tell you something.) But they are noisy--lots of pounding drums and clashing cymbals, and one could argue about whether this music is even in good taste. (Don't expect Faure or Mendelssohn.) The performances and recordings are just fine and there is no real competition anyway, so ultimately the music itself is the deciding factor. Fans of late romantic Swedish symphonies will want to check these out."
3,"Great interface/graphics, but only average gameplay","The ships are gorgeously rendered, and the Enterprise even has ncc-1701-e written on the hull. Scaling for Borg ships a bit too small, however. Sound effects and music are top notch, and the voices of actors Patrick Stewart and Michael Dorn add authenticity to the game.Gameplay became repetative and boring after awhile, with the only strategy being ""whoever has the biggest and baddest ships wins."" Its essentially warcraft 2 in space.Overall an entertaining game and a must have for trekkies, and certainly better than Command and Conquer, but I still like warcraft 2 and starcraft better."
5,Action - Strategy - Coolness,"I've played a lot of the other Star Trek games and most of them are full of brand name and completly devoid of gameplay, ST: Armada manages to full fill both.It also has amazing community support!"
2,A great disapointment from activision,"Ive expected moch more from activision: 1) The campaign is very short (star-craft has 10 missions for each race armada has 4). 2) Maybe the units look diferent but thay ate identical in their parameters (like warcraft 1,2,exspension set 1993-1995). 3) The game has still the look from above that is tipical to old games such as red alert 1, dune 2000, red alert tibirian sun and so on. 4) there ere very limited ships to each of the races.the only good thing of this game is the fact that it is STAR TREK but i'm no sure that this game deserves to carry this great name."
5,Trek Meets AOE,"Excellent game, good action and good graphics. Trekkies will, of course, love it. Its like a Star Trek version of Age of Empires."
1,Bugs & Dumps,This is a good game if or when it works right...Which is never...I think it is a beta version which was raced into product without any real thought of the buying public's real usage. Activision won't email you to explain bug fixes. Resources on cd troubleshooting are limited. I pass on this turkey and any other Activision product.
2,Where are all the Intrepid-Class ships at?,"I was unimpressed with this game. The races are too similar to each other. The ships within each race do not differ much except in size. Mouse control is painfully sluggish. Space is two-dimensional - ...Resource collection is uncreative. Several ship classes are missing, such as the Intrepids. Only 8 ships can be selected at a time. Whether I played the Borg or the Federation, I got the feeling that I was just building the same things with different graphics in a [copy] of Starcraft.Generally, a rather half-hearted effort at a real-time strategy game. It's not bad, really, it's just that there are much better games out there. Like Armada II."
5,great action mixed with stratagey,"you control any of the 4 races federation,klingon,romulan,and borg,and the fighting is neverending good for the people who are bored with all them talking games.thats all"
1,FULL OF BUGS,This acts like a pre-beta release of the game. IT crashes often and locks up even more often. Still waiting for Activision to address their mistakes. Steering clear of this game is a good idea.
4,Great Game,"My cousin loves playing this game and can't stop. Like really, he can't. It's addicting. So he says."
3,A good strat. game.,its a good startrek 3d strategy game but i allways had a problem with it crashing.
4,Not bad at all.,"ST: Armada is a really spectacular first try for an RTS (Real Time Strategy) game. It has a decent story line for the solo missions and it's online playing capability is superb. Only complaint is that there is a severe lack of different ships and it would have been a little better if you could have had a ""higher view from above"" when commanding huge armadas in online play. It's worth buying, it's worth playing. It's a good game."
2,ehhh a big disapointment,"I'm a big real time strategy fan, and when i saw that star trek came out with a game that gives me the power to create and command ships in that way,i was excited. when i finally got it it was filled with nothing but disapointments. first you'd think four different races from the galaxy would be different to use no. they're all the same, just a few cheesy special weapons. the ships look great but my opinion they should be a bit larger, i mean i have a hard time finding my scouters they're so small. the missions are very easy, any starcraft veteran as myself can set up a few defenses and rest easy. another problem is destroying your enemy, it takes forever! i've played star trek armada 2 and they're is such a huge difference. graphics are solid though. but i recommend to buy the sequel you get way more ships, which i really dont understand why you get so few in the first."
5,Star Trek: TNG at its best....,"I've waited for a good Next Gen game to come out, and I was not at all disappointed. I enjoyed watching as an amazing story unfolded before my eyes. It was a good storytelling, action packed, and a thinking game all rolled into one. To those of you who were mentioning the Borg being too powerful...that's what they are. It was refreshing to see that not everyone was on equal footing, otherwise where would the challenge be in playing as the three empires against the overwhelming horde of Borg. I hope that everyone gets as much thrill out of this adventure as I did."
4,A Little Buggy,"I have been playing Armada for the past two weeks. It is a great strategy game but does have a few bugs. In a previous review a user stated he/she has had problems with AMD Athlon processors. I have not had such major problems running the game on mine. It has crashed and kicked me out to windows a few times but not on a regular basis. To solve this, I make sure I am saving my game periodically (so you don't have to start over from the beginning in your current mission). When trying to complete the Romulan missions is when it seems to kick me out. When this happens the game actually ""forgets"" that I have completed the last Klingon mission and states that I must complete my Klingon mission before moving further in the mission series. This game is by far better than Interplays Federation as a strategy game. Overall the game is great and I highly suggest any Star Trek fan to purchase."
1,you can't be sirius,There is a magic ruel abaut star trek games - thay all usualy very bad and unfotunnetly this game is no exseption. I'm a big star trek fan and i had hopes for this game becouse it was suposed to be a good RTS game but it is'nt. first of all the it has lot's of anoying bugs it is very slow and it is on the level of warcraft2(1995) in the matter of groups and above all the price is astronomic for a game like this and i would recomend keep distance from this game.
1,Would have been a cool game expect.,"Start, play for five minutes, then CRASH. Norton SystemWorks couldn't handle those. I hope they have patches soon."
3,PC Only and iMac Owner Swoons,"By PC, I do not mean Politically Correct.I've played the game, to much pleasure. Alas, it's only been on borrowed time on a friend's borrowed PC. Pity it's not up to the Mac OS ... but I do hope in time it will be."
1,bad,"this game is awufal. it has loads of bugs, and gets slow towards the end of it. There are very few units also. I have had it for 3 days, and i am already board. Also the AI is really bad. I need to play on the hardest setting, and it is still easy. If you want a better game for less price, then buy Starcraft."
2,Not Activision's usual quality,Every time I have bought an activision game I have loved it. But Armada is not a game like that. Its major faluts are:bugs(it crashes every few minitues) AI (the computer has yet to beat me) patches (Activision stopped makeing patches!) and that it requres a fast computer to run well. However the graphics are good and it is fun when it isnt crashing. Buy this only if you are a trekke and rich.
4,Anohter Good Trek Game,"In the past year, Star Trek games have gone from worst to almost first. Armada is a Warcraft type game, in which you have to build up your resorces to mount an attack on the enemy. While games like Age of Empire do this better, Armada isn't bad. It has good graphics and the game play is easy to understand. It seems a little buggy, but it hasn't crashed on me once. Activision has good support, so a new patch is never hard to get. Again, this is one of the better Trek efforts and it should please all Trek fans and non fans alike!"
2,Give it a few months.,"Straight and simple: Wait for a couple more patches. It has the potential to be a great game, but the game is presently just loaded with bugs that Activision was just too lazy to fix in the Beta versions.Buy it, but not yet."
4,Buggy but good,I've been playing this game for a few years on my 300mhz and just loaded it onto a 600 mhz machine. It has always been a bit buggy even with the 1.2 patch but it plays well enough to be a good time. With the addition of the mods you can find on the net the game can be changed endlessly to keep you interested. I would recommend this game to any ST fan.
4,really cool but bug problems,"this game is cool, cool details, cool weapon and weapon sound affects and cool storyline i like how it tells you your mission but it would be better if some of the bugs or should i say all of the bugs were wiped out i think activision didnt take there time on this one"
4,First good Trek game.,"I have to admit, it does look a whole lot like StarCraft, except has a whole lot more bugs. But it is a GOOD game. Despite the lack of single player missions, and a storyline, the multiplayer functionality is quite good. I gave this game up for Diablo II pretty quick, but not after a good 2 weeks or so of a good time playing.But, the price seems a bit steep."
2,Ok Game - no great,"I've played ST: Armada all the way through all the scenarios and I must say that while the game is fun, the Borg were made just way too powerful. The Federation ships are ok, but the Klingons and the Romulons are too weak to be belived. Not to mention that the AI is NOT (intelligent, that is). When I play multi-player, I play the borg and it's a rare occasion when I loose ships and/or structures to anything but stupidity.If you are an absolute ST fanatic, go ahead and get this game. But if you are in to the RealTime Strategies, better if you skip this one for now. At least untill some of the sudden abort bugs are fixed (bugs that cause the game to abort and exit back to windows without any notification or warning)."
5,Star Trek as you have never seen it Before!,"Star Trek, the Final Frontier... these words are of the great history of the Star Trek universe. The whole concept of this world is amazing and very likable.Over the years many games have come out that are about Star Trek and have the facts, but they weren't really what people were looking for. Now after so long, a Star Trek game is now released that truly shows how great this World is. Star Trek - Armada is this game. It is a Real Time Strategy 3d game of the Star Trek universe. It expresses it very well. You are able to pick up to 4 races... the Federation, the Klingon, the Romulans, and the Borg. Each race has about 10 special abilities and their own units. The story line of this game is very good and it clearly shows an Expansion coming up. This is definitly a game to put on your must-buy list.If you are a Star Craft or Command & Conqueror fan, this the next game for you."
3,Full of bugs is correct!,"I've spent the past couple of weeks playing this game and havemade it all the way to the Romulan campaign. Right now, I'm fightinglike crazy to defeat the Borg, and every time I come close, the game crashes on me. Of course, I could skip to the Borg campaign, but that would spoil everything, wouldn't it?Good game, but only if it didn't bomb out on me. END"
4,Star Trek - Armada,"I thought the game was very fun and good. You have the Federation,Borg,Romulans, and Klingons. The Ferengi, Dominion, Breen and Cardassians also make appearances. It has the habit of sometimes crashing but that doesn't happen a lot. One thing I was disappointed with is how short and easy the missions were, even with the setting on hard they were easy. The graphics were good. It has a good multiplayer connection and instant action against the computer. If you are a trekkie it wouldn't hurt you to buy it! Also the game I have does work on Windows XP."
2,Would like to play the game but...,I bought this game as soon as it hit the shelves. I tried to play it but it wouldn't work. I didn't have a 3D accelerator. So I bought one just for use in this game. Then it wouldn't work because I didn't have a good enough CD-Rom drive. It wasn't able to read all the info on the disk. Why would a company make a game that to be played someone has to buy almost a whole new computer.
1,Pitiful excuse of a RTS title,"First of all, like most Activision games, it's full of bugs. I not just talking about gameplay bugs, I'm talking about SHOW STOPPING bugs. The game won't even run with the latest hardware and chipsets. It's got a compatibility problem with AMD Athlon motherboards and nVidia-based graphics cards. It says that it looks best in 32-bit color mode, well, SURPRISE, it doesn't even work with 32-bit color graphic cards, namely GeForce and TNT cards. I've also heard, from the Armada Forum, that it screws up your computer's system files.If you're lucky that you have a machine that it will run on, the gameplay is utterly ridiculous and silly. Play balancing is a joke. Each races ship-class's special weapons cancel each other out. Tic-Tac-Toe anyone? An 'X' for an 'O', sort of thing.Graphics don't use lighting effects. Cut-scenes are screwed up with slow video-audio calibration."
1,dissapointed,"The jack would not work out of the crate,called the company was told need to get it repaired. did not feel that I should ahve to have a new jack repaired"
5,great story of a bad occurence,This book takes place in 1995 in the gulf of mexico on the DLB-269 which derrick lay barge which was used to lay completed sections of pipe on the ocean floor to get oil and gas from the oil fields to the yucatan peninsula.The 269 was home to 245 men who were riggers divers mechanics and support crew.This story describes the men who work on the barge and the work they along with the rush to complete so the company they work for could get a 27 million dollar payment on a contract they where behind on .It also follows the fateful decisions concerning the diving crew who were going threw decompression in a diving bell having to be there from working at depths of a 160 feet and the barge it self laying the path of hurricane roxanne and why they were left at sea instead of allowing to go to safe harborthis was a great book of terrible tragdey read this book
4,Book Review - All the Men in the Sea,This was an intriguing read. Being employed in the marine construction industry this was of great interest to me. It helps us recognize the inherent risks that go with this industry. The book was factually correct and well written.
1,Bobble Head: Riddler,"Received this item today and I have to tell you the paint job I found awful and cheesy. His mask, shirt, the rim around the hat and gloves lean towards more of a purple shade and not gray. His suit is more of a deeper green. The bag he holds is green as well with a purple question mark on it. The picture on amazon does it better justice then the real item. Don't waste your money on it, try to find it in a store instead and look at it. If the people at Monogram took the time to give it a better paint job then perhaps it would have been a better looking piece."
1,This is IT!?!,"With a subject as exciting as the Blue Angels and a platform as rich as DVD, you would think it would be a sure winner. This is far from it. With only 50 minutes of play time you think it would be packed with action. Instead we see long crowd shots at airshows, the pilots DRIVING to the airfield, extensive on the ground footage of stationary F/A-18's. All of this isn't bad, it's just too long and drawn out. Except for occasional brilliant shots of the stunning Blue Angels in acrobatic flight, this DVD stalls by the halfway point. The music is second rate and indicative of the effort as a whole. Buy a book about the Blue Angels, it will be more thrilling."
4,Blue Angels - Rolling in the Sky,Outstanding if you want to see the Blue Angels fly! I found this to be excellent for the shots of the arial manuevers etc. The DVD's music is dated but tasteful. No commentary. This is a plus if you don't care about background bla bla bla (other DVDs tend to be that way). Overall a very pleasing DVD.
5,Kids toy rake,"Great kids toy rake for my nephew,also bought the kids toy shovel to go along with this,they make a great combo for that little one who wants to helpout with the spring and winter duties"
3,"Looks fun, but has some issues.","The Genesis version of this is a great buy. It's not like that for the Game Gear Version of the game, but if you have a Game Gear, this is a decent buy. The graphics are the best part, with good looking 8-bit sprites, the music is also a high point, but that is no surprise from SEGA. The game's physics and controls, however, are straight up horrible. Sonic doesn't feel light, as a pinball should somewhat feel, but rock hard. You can't really control Sonic's direction, in which the Genesis version, you can. My final thought: If you have a Game Gear, you should look into getting this, as it is somewhat fun and it is cheap. If you don't, just ignore this game all together. (P.S. Whoever wrote about there being violence and cursing, that is competely wrong. The game is in today's ESRB, would be an E for Everyone.)"
2,Too busy.,"Dizzying to say the least. The camera movement is confusing, what with pans, zooms and distracting close ups ... all uncontrolable by the user. The graphics are nice, but the video options don't warn you when you select an option that is beyond your graphics card's capabilities."
3,3 Realistic Pinball Games,The pinball games are very realistic and the graphics are very good. The ball moves realisticly. You can even lift and tip the machine and it can tilt. I don't see how this game could be improved other than by having more machines. I only gave it 3 stars because it's pinball.
4,bugwatch toy review,When I received this item it was packaged in a brown box for shipping which was fine. When I opened the packaging box the toy's box that it came in was very damaged. They toy was fine but the box looked like it came from a used toy store. I was a little embarrassed to give it away as a gift. The toy it self was fine so I gave it to my nephew who is 5. He enjoyed the toy.
4,Tuxedo Vest and Tie,"The men's silver tuxedo vest and tie were delivered wihtin days.The quality was excellent. The vest and tie combo were a good accessorychoice to my son's prom tuxedo. It can be worn to a school prom, weddings, special occasions and also matches his dress suit."
3,Needs to be updated,"I didn't realize that the book was so old when I accepted Amazon's offer to bundle it with Admiralty in a Nutshell. This is a 1984 edition and, in the section I read, was really lacking some critical information. When discussion how the United States handles oil spills there is, obviously, no mention of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 - A HUGE omission. I suspect that there are other such discrepancies because of its age."
1,puke,"i love Cradle of Filth, as a matter of fact i just got back from Tournography in Anaheim last night, but this is more like a sonic slap in the face than anything else. there are a few impressive piano manouvers but other than that every song sounded VERY incomplete. each track left me dying for the end of the CD much less dying for more. i did listen to about 75% of it despite how much i hate it hoping that atleast one track would be done well but it never came. Her Ghost in the Fog is a song that if you must re-do, you ABSOLUTELY have to do it VERY WELL. All they did for that song was the keyboard intro, and despite the fact that they did the intro very well, it was an immaculate letdown that a) they didn't finish the song and b) every song thereafter was equally incomplete.i think i might take a video of this record burning and put it on U-tube or something."
2,Not what I had imagined...,"I must say that I agree with Silverlychon; this recording sounds, at best, incomplete and is a bit of a ""slap in the face"" for Cradle of Filth fans. Perhaps it is my own stupidity but when I read ""Scorched Earth Orchestra"", I actually expected an orchestra of strings, woodwind, percussion...; grandiose versions of the already stunning orchestral arrangements from my favourite black metal band. I had sonic imaginings of the video footage I had seen of Nightwish recording their orchestral backings with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. However, this is essentially piano/organ versions of the Cradle of Filth arrangements with occasional cello/violin backing and, quite frankly, lacks the any intensity to make it interesting or justify the price I paid for it."
3,The new type of games,"The new type of games besically excel in graphics and not really the game. In this games it's ALL graphics. It's not nessarily based on the card game which was a dissapointment to me. But the graphics are AWESOME especially for it being a gamecube game. So if you can get past not having this be based on the card game, but the monsters go ahead and buy this game.-SteelWolf"
2,"As much as you love Yu-Gi-Oh or RPGs, this game is boring.","The game can go so slow that you would want to rip your hair out. And then, so fast you can't keep up. The graphics recycle the same environments over and over. The sound isn't that great and there is no voice acting. The text is hard to read. It barely explains itself. If you like Yu-Gi-Oh, you will enjoy the characters, but not the crappy game. It's tedious and it barely has any variety to it. If you like RPG's, get Baten Kaitos or something. I don't reccomend this. Even to Yu-Gi-Oh fans."
3,"graphics are good, at least","even if you are a fan of yugioh, you will be disappointed.how to play: 1. click button 2. repeati like the graphics, but it is boring................"
4,OK Game,"This game is fun and I really enjoy using the god monsters. But the only thing that I really hate about this game is that some of the rounds that you have to do are really stupid and unfair. Like, they will make you take on 6 opponents one right after another with your weekest player using week monsters. But other than that I think that is kind of fun."
2,Whatever,"I thought this game would be based on the card game/show, but it is not. You dont do anything but tell which monster you have attacks which of your opponent's and most of the time it aint even your turn for one and secondly, you die basically the first round of play every time you play the game. Graphics is good, and that is the only thing good about the game."
4,Betch you can't!,"Yu-gi-oh Falsebound Kingdom is about Yu-gi and allies or Kaiba and allies struggling to escape a Season 3 based world. I prefernot to play Story-mode...the other mode isbetter cuz you can toughen yourself to ""the limits.""I would buy this game cuz it is well worth its money."
1,stupidest game ever,it is like pokemon. and it is very boring. and i hated it i wish i never wasted my money on it.
1,This game stinks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is so bad that if I play it for one second I get bored.
4,this is a childish game for 2 year olds,this game should stop being made cause its boring and dumb and stupid and for little kids and i dont like it because yugioo is just so dumb when their going to come out with something else like pokemon. dont buy this.
3,An ok game,this game of course has its goods and bads for instace when you battle your opponet could go 5 times using 3 monsters and when your turn comes you can attack maybe only once!!! And also this has absolutaly nothing to do with the cards at all.. You have to beat the to get the Egytion god monsters. Their are some good parts about this game like you think sratigy like and you can take over forts with your army!!! So over all its a OK game rent it before you get it though.!!!
4,AWESOME!!!,This game is so awesome! I was waiting for a long time for this game to come out for gamecube! I'm so happy with it! Peace! This Evil Talking Dogs out! *Winks*
4,yugioh on gamecube,I havve never played it becuse it's not out but I know a little bit about it (note none of this is ofical but it's most likely true) It takes place in a viirtul game world you chose to play as yugi or kiba and try to get out using your cards. also it's ore like a pokemon game becuse i htink you travel around beting cards to get them to battle withh. can't wait for it to come out
1,this game suxxxxx,ok i thought this game would be awesome but i rented it from blockbuser and it stunk. 5 minutes into playing it and i went crazy. i spent $6.00 on it for a week and im never playin it again. its got a final fantasy battle layout which is fine...for final fantasy. can you tell me when yugioh had to do with real monsters (besides holograms) and its 3 on 3 battles not the same strategic cards we love. if i could go into negatives for the rating it would get a -5. im really 14. good job Konami
4,It could have been great,"Yes it has stunning graphics, but to many people it's just another FINAL FANTISY wannabe. Okay it's not that much like the popular Japenese series but that's the fell you get when you play this game.I personaly think this game could have been better, but it's still a preety kick@$$ game."
3,So fun.,"I really enjoy this game. It was worth the money, I love that it isn't just the basic card game like the other games I already have, nice job!"
2,A dissapointment,"Although it has a few promising traits, this was a very bad first attempt for a next-gen Yu-Gi-Oh! game, the gameplay is repetitive and tediously slow. Your stuck with three minor monsters for a long time, and there are no cut-scenes to speak of. Over all, this makes the sims look like an action game. My advice? Only buy this if you have A LOT of time on your hands, and you don't get bord easily."
4,not bad,this game is fun and challenging but when you beat the game not much to do exepect getting all the monsters you don't really walk around but i really like this game
1,BORING!!!,"This was one of the first few games I rented and boy, was I dissappointed!Music - STUNK - They keep playing it over and over...Gameplay - Horrable - You just walk around, do the lamest battles over and over, then that's it!Battling - Worst part of the Game - I couldn't handle it. Just take turns hitting each other. That's it. Sure, you can create a fort, but that's it!Overall - I returned this within the first hour I rented it! It's that bad!"
1,Where are the cards?,"Isn't Yu-Gi-Oh! a card game? Well, this is not. It's just some pick, stand, and watch crap! Not once in the game do you see one card. And when you're not in a battle, you can easily get lost. The map is huge, your character is puny. You pick your location and watch your dude WALK there. You know how long that takes? Hours! Especially if the location's far. When you're finally done killing your enemy, you try to find another location, pick it, then start walking. And your starting monsters are stupidly weak compared to your enemies. I had a Celtic Guardian that was level 5, against a kuriboh that was...guess what...level 30! A KURIBOH! LEVEL 30! WTFH? Yu-Gi-Oh! doesn't have levels like Pokemon. Get the games that are actually based on the cards, not this Pokemon wannabe. Rekanize!"
2,They did it again!,It seems impossible for any company to make a good game based on a franchise. This is no exception. While somewhat entertaining and strategic Falsebound kingdom can be infuriating and features basicly the same gameplay level after level. Hardcore fans will enjoy this but casual gamers most likely will not. Make sure to rent it before you buy it. You might not want to be stuck owning this game.
3,yu-gi-oh! falsebound kingdom,this game is good because of the music and rpg syle fighting system. if you like a good rpg game then this game would be my choice.
4,Yu-gi-oh! Falsebound Kingdom...Is it fun or isn't it?,"Excellant! Brilliant! What else is there to say?This is a fantastic game I can not get enough of it! If you love the series, you will never, ever be able GET ENOUGH of this EVER WICKED game!"
3,...,"um ...k im not here to do a review. Im just here to display my thoughts on how bad these reviews are getting ><. I mean, you guys are sitting around saying its good cuz u can be yugi and stuff. Explin wut u liked! wut u hated! Wut the game is about and why we should buy it! plz write proper reviews...thx."
2,Goes Nowhere,"At first this game is loads of fun, battling and building strength and special attacks. You start as Yugi, battling in the Falsebound Kingdom, a computer generated game. If you beat the first round, then you have the option as playing as Seto Kaiba. If you beat that round, you then have the option to play as Joey. However, after that, the game goes nowhere. there is no ending. You just keep playing. There's just no point. Don't waste your money. Unless you found it at a garage sale for 5 bucks. Then it might be worth it."
2,A big let down,"I rented this game thinking it to be a fun RPG, but I was wrong. It starts out cool you pick Yugi or Kiba. I picked Kiba, it said I had to destriy a rebellion, sounds fun. I deployed my troops to one of there villages and on the way I was attacked by a monster. I tired to add it to my team once I had beaten it but I had to be back at this map to do it. So now I'm stuck with weakend monsters. I get to the village and I play aggainst this guy, It was so bad, who goes is selected by random so your opponet could go three times in a row! It has nothing to do with the cards! I lose so I come back and decied to try and find some monsters, There wasn't a single monster. The next day I went back to blockbuster and traded Falsebound for Kirby Air Ride. I actully had fun with that game. Why did I give Yu-Gi-Oh a 2 insted of a 0, Sagi the dark clowns attack, dark swoop looked realy cool. It was a huge explosion of dark magic!"
2,Same Same Same Same,"The graphics on the game are OK but the game itself is repetitive and not interesting. The battles aren't as interesting as the other YuGi games because you can't mix up your deck; you only fight with three monsters. It's not even as complicated as Pokemon Stadium where you can at least mess with the matchups to get different types. And the adventuring is weak because it's just go to a board, beat all the opponents, move to a new board, do the same thing, move to a new board, do the same thing, move to a new board, do the same thing.It may be alright to rent for a few days but I wouldn't buy this."
5,Great RPG,"This is a really fun RPG. The battles arent really hard, however some of them are really long. Overall a great game.A+++++++"
4,Meet Mario And Luigi!,"Two Brothers set out to find Cackalinena and Fallfull, The plants that cursed Peach's Voice,Took Over the World,But Worst off All they put Bowser out Of a job.Yeah! Talk About a need of Weed Wackers. Join Mario And Luigi save the day in Mario And Luigi:Superstar Saga"
4,One of the best Mario and Luigi Games!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is one of my favorite games I have.Good Parts: Neat items, cool characters, funny humor, and great story.Bad Parts: Sometimes the bullies are hard to beat."
2,dont' get it?,"We love Mario, but we can't figure this game out at all. My 7 year old won't even play it anymore. I don't get it."
2,Decent game but very hard.,I dont know. I guess Im just not good at games like these.My mind doesnt work that way.Theres a lot of people who do have those skills though.I guess I just suck at RPGs except Zelda.
2,"Great Graphics, poor gameplay","This game looks awesome, but its not. The story is weak, and, honestly, pointless. The gameplay is the simplest, most shallow I have ever seen in an RPG. If you're looking for depth, I'd suggest Final Fantasy Tactics Advance."
1,Awesome- until the last level,"This game has a fascinating story line, great characters, etc. However, the last level of the game has one problem. A series of pillars you must jump across. This little excercise has nothing to do with the brainwork of earlier puzzles, the sharp shooter style gameplay of earlier enemies, it's simply a waste of time. Spend 40 hours conquering through a brilliant game to waste 8 AA batteries and 5 hours trying to jump between two pillars before you get it right. A huge mistake in programming."
1,really blows.....,I've been playing the Mario Bros. series since it first came out. This is by far the worst mario game of all time. If you want a truely good mario game get Super Mario Bros. 3.
5,A Paper Mario mimic,"I think this game is going to be like Paper Mario only a better story. A fine looking RPG comes to gameboy advance!!! The story begins with bowser ( Like always). Look for these awsome titles to. Fire Emblem, Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hands, Metroid: Zero Missions, and Super Mario Bros. 3 advance v.4."
4,A Good Use Of TIme,"Ok, I literally spent over 20 hours so far trying to finish this game its story line is the hardest so far to figure out.Not compared to the recent mario and luigi partners in time for the nintendo ds i beat that in under 3 hours compared to 20 thats a big difference considering that nintendo ds game comes with the map so thats makes the whole game overly easy.This game i would definitely recommend buying it never gets boring"
4,A whole new Mario game.,"This game is pretty cool but what the heck is all this bull about it being a sequel to Paper Mario? This game has nothing to do with Paper Mario!The real sequel to Paper Mario is called Paper Mario 2 and its gonna come out for gamecube, (...)Anyway, this game is very good I just have 3 words:What-the-heck? This game sooo confusing For example, you activate Mario's fire powers, opening a door. But to get through the room inside that door, you have to go wwayyyyyy back and do something to complete the room. im like... >_<But besides that, I love the way the battle style is set. You can actually dodge the attacks yourself. You have cool Bros Moves, cool powers, whole new land to explore: Beanbean kingdom (the mushroom kingdoms neighbor) What more do you want out of a great game like this?"
4,Greatest Gameboy Game this Year,"This game has very good battle mode.But fighting the last Cackeletta was very hard.You start off with 1 health.Nonetheless,this game was somewhat challeging and I managed to beat it.I highly recommend this game because of its great story mode and it has many cool items you can equip to strengthen you up during battle.So if you dont have this game already,GET IT NOW!!!!"
4,"AWESOM, BUT 1 MINOR FLAW","this game rules! from beggining to finish, its challenging and the game time is really long. (which is a good thing) their is only 1 minor flaw. (if i could, i would give this game 4 and 3/4 stars.) the thing is, it has a really corny and borring plot. princess peaches (she's the princess from where mario and luigi come from) voice gets stolen and it gets replaced with ""explosive vocabulary."" (when she talks, bombs come out of her mouth.) you will see what i mean if u get this game. it is an awesome, must buy game so you still get it. it is definitly the best game in the paper mario rpg series. (role playing game.) if u wanna chat with me bout other games, instant message me. my sn (screen name) is ""tennismaster013"")"
4,Wow!,"Ok, so I'm a girl. But this game is awsome! It has adventure, challenges, and more! Unlike some other games which are boring. (I mean the ones that arn't Mario and Luigi games). Some may be ok but this is definitely the best!"
3,A little to tough,"Aaron Warner here. This is very interesting, but it's very hard to understand. Most games have you press START to pause. In this game, you switch leader with START. The new story is not as interesting as saving Peach from Bowser though. The controls are hard to use. And, why Luigi doesn't jump when you jump if Mario's the leader However, besides that, the whole 'more then 1 person travels at one time' ideas has always been my favorite. This game is just itching for a better idea on story, a better control system, and an easier to understand game play. That's all. The graphics are pretty cool."
4,Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga,"Condition is good for a used game, the game is easily understood by kids, graphics for being an old game is good enough."
3,"Short, To-The-Point Reviews: Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga","I was unimpressed. The Mario & Luigi handheld RPG series just doesn't stack up to the Paper Mario series or the original Legend of the Seven Stars. Not to label the game, franchise or the creators or anything, but this game in particular is better suited for younger children because of the level of difficulty, involvement and storyline this RPG supplies. Great game to break a younger sibling into the great RPG universe. The characters of this game are a riot though. Simply hilarious."
4,Ech...,"Ok, I love this game to death. All though I could use the money to buy Sonic battle or other but I wanted this game here. I played it and it remended me of a RPG but you have more options to move around. The only thing I have a problems with this game is that in is full of mini-games. Mini-games that you MUST complete in order to move on in the game. But of course if you love the bitter irony of Luigi being the Mr.Green fraidy-cat then go on and by the game. I laugh during most of the game play cause the animations remended me of some silly anime expressions. Hmm. That's nintendo for you."
5,Best Mario Game YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Mario and Luigi superstar saga is the perfect combination of action, adventure, and a little bit of comedy thrown in. This game utilizes GBA Sp's few buttons to it's full potential, Mario and luigi also has incredible graphics for GBA Sp's small screen and limited capabilities of graphics. This game also has the old style of mario fighting, which gives the game it's ultimate perk. Yet by far the best thing about this game is using combos and learning new tricks to defeat your enemies. Mario and luigi superstar saga get a definite A+."
4,this game is greater then everything,This game is the best. i already beat the game it was very enjoyable. the last boss is what you think(thats right it is cakula). but it is a ghost because mario and Mr.green killed her.(...) you go to devehensu's faq because it is the best. or you can go to mefrog's faq which is big and it good.a trick is in the game when you go to hoohoo village go to a cave and pass it. go through the bigde and you will see a fan like thing. go to the water and switch to mario.he will drink and keep the water in his belly. go to the fan and sqirt the water out by using high jump or the hammmers to get 3 shots. you will get a mushroom there for free and is useful in the beginning of the game. most of the time you will get a coin so keep trying and you will get up to 99 mushrooms if you do it for a lot. this ends my review.---- good day mario gamers
4,cool game!,"When this game first came out, I really wanted to buy it. Then when I looked at the back part, for some reason it didn't look too interesting. So I decided not to buy it. Then a few months passed and my friend just got a game boy advance sp.She wanted to buy this game but they were sold out everywhere she went. She looked in quite a few places. After about a week of searching, I found it for her. Then when I read the reviews for this game I started to get interested in it. So when I looked for it, they didn't have it at the places that I called. But then I found it the next day and so I bought it. And now I am LOVING it. Actually when I bought it, I didn't open it for a week. I wanted to try out my friend's game first to see if I would really like it but after playing for about 10 minutes or so, I liked it so then I opened my game and now I'm into 1 hour something into the game."
5,superb,This book is without a doubt one of the best books written on the subject. It serves both as an introduction as well as a practical guide to implementing the theory. Most books on the subject can be very academic and dry (some are downright dehydrated) but this presents the material in a very pleasant and conversational style. Highly recommended!
1,another worthless gadget,"Despite the implication of statements in the review by Dr. McConnell (who happens to be the inventor of the product), mechanical efficiency of breathing and gas exchange in the lungs is not the rate limiting factor in athletic performance in individuals with healthy lungs, the rate limiting factor is typically the efficiency of the metabolic processes which occur in the muscles, which this device does nothing for.It is not the body's ability to get oxygen into the blood that needs to be trained (unless there is some compromise of pulmonary function), but rather how efficiently the skeletal muscles' use the oxygen being delivered to them.Go ahead and give this item a try if you want, but find out if they offer a money-back guarantee first, because chances are it will do little to improve your performance. You'd have better results simply practing your sport or activity and performing conditioning work specific to your goals."
3,Only for elite level training,I dont think this will benefit your average person nearly as much as the person that need the extra edge. Really wasnt that enjoyable to use.
5,Power Breathe of fresh air,I recommend the Power Breathe for everyone who breathes. As an asthmatic and an athlete it has helped my performance immensely. I will be ready to get the next one soon!
2,Powerbreathe heavy resistance,"I'm a confessed continuous improvement freak. You usually find me trying new apparel, shoes, supplements,training, nutrition, etc., Anything to improve the marathon times of a 52 year old male! So I had nothing to lose by trying Powerbreathe heavy resistance(except $55!). The good news is that I can do 30 reps at level 5 and getting better. The bad news is that I don't notice a difference. I hope it can at least make it to a good placebo!"
2,Difficult to understand,"I've been listening to the CDs while commuting. I've found it difficult to understand and cannot always determine which letter some of the words begin with. If I were fluent in spanish already, I'm sure I would have no problems understanding what they're saying. Since I'm trying to learn, I was looking for extremely distinct pronunciation. The sound system in my vehicle, which is a 2005, has 6 speakers so I don't think that it is the problem."
2,So-So,I have a background in Spanish and wanted something to brush up. I just do not think this one is that good. I have heard better.
1,Listen and repeat...,"""listen and repeat....listen and repeat.....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat.....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat.....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat.....listen and repeat....listen and repeat....listen and repeat...."""
5,Berlitz Rush Hour Spanish,"Sure, the jingles are a little corny, but the repitition and presentation make it very easy to learn the basic words and phrases to get started with Spanish. I'd highly recommend it for any commuter wanting something more than to just pass the time."
3,Easy but not thorough,"In my opinion this is a good way to get your feet wet in Spanish I drive for a pizza place and try and put that time to good use and this cd was helpful in learning basic phrases, after I was done listening to it several times I could probabably communicate in spanish at the level of a 5 year old native speaker. Colors, numbers, basic nouns and verbs, for something more in depth though I recommend the series with Michel Thomas."
1,Not for music lovers.... or likers.,"I got this with a little apprehension, suspecting that the music might not be a bit cheesy, but I am really trying to learn Spanish during my commute, so I thought I'd try.Well the music is so heinously bad that I couldn't put it back in my CD player after having heard it once. I'd try and listen, but the cheap synthesiser sound and plinkety-plonk tunes would start to grate on my nerves so fast, I'd reach straight for the eject button."
4,Painless Spanish,"Recodings are very clear and can be understood while driving. Won't know how well I learn until I'm finished but I am sure I will learn something, que?"
5,Berlitz rush hour spanish,A very exciting way to learn something new. Enjoyable to listen to while driving down the road.
3,"Espanol, por favor!","The songs are catchy, and I like to speak along with the actors, but sometimes they are hard to understand. I have found out later that I am mispronouncing things when I look at the little text that came with the CDs. Not for people who have no experience with Spanish, but it's a good review."
1,Yuck,"These songs were so annoying that I considered opening the car window and throwing the CD's out so no one else would ever have to listen to them. I donated it to the children's library instead, since our librarian thought children might like them. I hope the donation is marked ""anonymous""."
3,Some Merit But Very Childish Approach,"I recognize that Berlitz is the industry leader in foreign language courses, but after using this course my only question is 'Why'?Berlitz Rush Hour Spanish is childish in its language teaching approach. Just the music is enough to discourage you.A much better choice for learning Spanish in your car is Behind the Wheel Spanish. No bizarre music, just learning to speak the language while in traffic."
1,This book was terrible.,"I was so disappointed in this book. My two year old son loves Franklin and his friends, but this was a complete waste. It really isn't a book to read, but a ""memory"" book instead, where you are to put in photos and other information about your child. The worst part was that although Franklin looked something like his character in the show, the ""friends"" looked NOTHING like themselves-they were just pictures of animals of the same breed. I'm not sure what the other Franklin books are like, but I would not recommend this one."
3,"Good game, but not accurate","I purchased this game for my husband and 12 year old son who are both avid Stooges fans. If you are obsessed with the Three Stooges and know their shorts inside and out, you will enjoy this game. However, you will quickly realize that the trivia questions are not always accurate. A question as simple as, ""What is Larry's real name?"" has an answer of ""Larry Feinburg."" The correct answer really is Louis Feinburg. We have had to correct answers on a lot of trivia cards and we have only just begun to play the game. The Three Stooges Encyclopedia would be very helpful to have on hand to double check your answers."
1,broken out of the box,"this filter (installed properly, according to the provided instructions), leaked fuel where the metal rim meets the glass housing. very disappointed."
5,"Goofy, but I loved it","Who knew that Chileans could be so goofy? Certainly not I. I must admit initially I was attracted by the box cover and was really anticipating much of anything. But then I watched it. And watched it again. And if I had a lousy day at work, I'll watch it again. It's light (ok, non-existent)on message or moral judgment, but some days you just can't be bothered with heavy. And oh, by the way, Sigrid Alegria is my new favorite actress."
2,So and so...,"A big hype in Chile a couple of years ago, ""Sexo con Amor"" is well acted and has some funny moments, although it looks rather old-fashioned and a little vulgar. It's similar to those famous italian sexual comedies from the 70's, with Gloria Guida, Edwige Fenech or Laura Antonelli. They used to be very popular and producers made good profits out of them. Yet, artistically speaking, doubts arise...Essentially, it was conceived as a commercial massive product, and that's exactly what you get. It will be specially enjoyed by the ones who like rancid jokes on sexuality and similarities. The rest, avoid it."
5,super seller!,Thanks for your review of Carry On Double Feature Vol 4: Carry On Up the Jungle & Carry On Loving!
2,Not really that funny,"I'm a Monty Python fan and a John Cleese fan, but this book in the format of a jovial dialog about ""life"" doesn't strike me as funny. It does have cute observations, and when it was published in the early 90s, it may have felt more timely, but it's quaint now."
3,"Love Cleese, good effort, style needs work","I enjoy this book, and go back to it sometimes for enjoyment, but it is not too deep, and very conscious and a bit slow in explaining its concepts. There's some insight, but I would recommend this mostly for fans of John Cleese who are also interested in the subject of the book."
2,speculative silliness,"'Robin' retains the role of therapist in this discussion with his former patient 'John', who, though witty and charming is a little too uncritical for my taste. Even if one is willing to accept a psychoanalytic account of personality development and family dynamics, and I am, the latter part of the book's speculations regarding management, politics, religion, and the like, are without foundation. I found it particulary annoying how they make the Japanese (not to mention Americans) sound like another species entirely.I found this a very disappointing sequel to 'Families and How to Survive Them'."
4,"Not everyone's cup 'o tea, but I appreciate the author's frank writing.","Not every woman will like this book. Anne Barone is very frank and not politically correct, although she is not looking to offend...you just won't see the AMA applauding its contents. This book is like talking to a friend who has lived in Paris and gives you the scoop of what she learned. The original Chic & Slim is the Cliff's Notes version of this book, so DEFINITELY grab this book over that one. You will get the same info but much more with Encore."
2,no duh,"This book is silly and not well written (who edited this book anyway? It's filled with typos!).While I do not disagree with Ms. Barone's basic tenet (that moderation is key), I think that she takes far too much credit for these ideas. Her observations are trite and obvious, especially to anyone who has spent any time abroad/known anyone who has spent time abroad.I bought the book partly out of curiosity, more so for some insight, and wound up reading it as a fascinating bit of how jotting down a few unresearched, oversimplified ideas can qualify someone as an expert author.Yes, I'm sour grapes, not because I'm a ""fatty"" (which I'm not and wouldn't call myself if I was) but because I could've written this myself but didn't have the nerve. So much for the cultural encounter. Quel dommage."
2,anti-History,"Why is this book anti-Historical? because the authors focus is not concerend with historical balance and truth. In the author's opinion only one race has committed the various crimes of war, racism, slavery and genocide. This race, according to Hess, needs to be punished, not only by paying a fine, reparations; but by acknowledging that all members of that race are racist by birth. To Hess the white race is forever guilty, much like the Eternal Jew. Hess is unable to see or understand that slavery, genocide, racism, war sexism are part of the human condition. So called people of color share in this..Just read the History of Africa and Asia.This author offers nothing new but white self hatred and a false guilt (read some of the other posts). Take a tour of our ghettos and see black culture at its best!"
2,Lots of Hammered Dulcimer,"There are certainly some decent tunes here but the programming is nothing to write home about. The big problem is the hammered dulcimer. What a horrible instrument it is. Its charm lasts about 15 seconds, and then it just sounds like a bunch of doorbells and cell phones ringing. Unfortunately, this is pretty much a hammered dulcimer record."
5,"Harmonious, Tender Soundtrack","This soundtrack is worth the buy! From first watching the film, I knew I had to have the music that accompanied it. The guitars gives soothing strains that calms the spirit, and the piano keys gives a satisfying blend of eloquence and rapture. I particularly enjoyed the recurring theme in ""Blue Morgan,"" ""Deep in Thought,"" and ""Driving"" (I still remember from this track the scene when Maggie said, ""I ain't got nobody but you Frankie""). And ""Frankie's Office"" adds a touch of electric keyboarding that basically did it for me in pulling this whole album in full circle. I collect movie score soundtracks and I am very much pleased to add this to my collection!"
1,Terrible,Dont Waste Your $$$ Cause Well In My Oppinion All Pacman Games Are Borring DO NOT BUY THIS I REPETE DO NOT NUY THIS Go Buy Sonic Insted
4,THE BEST GAME EVER,"This game is one of the best and tightest fighting games ever made for gameboy advance. You can choose from 1 to four players, their are codes, and five levels for each turle."
2,They Could've Put A Little More Effort into Making This Game,"Well, I must say, I was quite disappointed. We have the ninja turtles game for PS2 and that one is great, my 5 year old loves it and can play it no problem....it goes on and on and on....one level after another. This one for the Gameboy Advance however, it has 4 levels. that's it. 4 levels. My son is asking for help every 5 minutes. I have a hard time beating the guys and I am definitely a gaming mom. So, after a few attempts, I beat it. In all of about 2 hours. So...I definitely DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES RECOMMEND THIS GAME. IT WAS A BIG WASTE OF MONEY OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT IS A NINJA TURTLE GAME. THE ONLY THING YOU ARE PAYING FOR, IS THE NAME."
5,Horse Illustrated Championship Season,Would the last reviewer please provide the website for this game. I cannot locate it anywhere.
3,It's Okay,"Overall, this game is okay. I can't do Cross Country because it's so messed up and pretty much gets boring after you get up to 800 credits. Just read the review by ... I agree with them. Equestriad and The Legacy of Rosemond Hill is way better. In Rosemond Hill you compete and theree are different horses for how well you place, four horses if you get 2nd-10th place, and 6 horses if you get 1st. My goal now is to own all the horses at least once in my different 'accounts'."
5,My Advice:BUY IT,"This is such a GREAT game, the graphics are completly the best I have ever seen, I have owned it for a while and still think is is sooooooooo fun, the only thing I wish is that u could own a virtual horse, but besides that it keeps you going, you dont play for 5 minutes and then you beat the entire game, when I started out playing it took me about 2-3 months just to get to the best horse!Also I do suggest to buy any other games that Farnam makes , well actually two companies make it !!"
3,This game is ok,"This game is fun at first, but after a while it gets boring. The sound effects are great and so is the animation. You have to earn credits to be able to ride different horses. There are 4 horses to choose from and even a goat. Theere is also a kitchen, tack room, and feed room.The riding part is boring. The dresage is hard, and the showjumping doesnt get any better. The cross country part has great scenes, but you have to take off way to early in order to make it over the fence. This is very unrealistic."
1,Give Info,"tell me about the game do you do Jumping,do you take care of the Horse can you pick your own horse tell me about the product!"
2,"Pretty Pictures, not much else","While the graphic presention in this book is excellent, the content is sorely lacking in detail. This is more of an idea book than an instructional one. Their rating system for degree of difficulty is completely innaccurate. Removing front coil springs is rated as more difficult than tasks like replacing the upper control arms (which require removing the front coil springs!) or even front rack and pinion conversions, which are extremely difficult. If you are looking for ideas on some possible projects, this is an OK book, although the information is widely available elsewhere. If you are looking for in depth instruction, this one is all sizzle and no steak."
5,Informative Read,"This book presents a lot of ideas for projects in a way that the average person could understand the level of difficulty involved and the tools and products necessary to complete them. Excellent full color photos. If you are a master mechanic or engine builder then this may not be challenging enough. However, if you own a Mustang in need of repairs or upgrades, then this is a great place to begin. Plus, being an old car magazine junkie, I recognized that the author was a former Editor of Super Ford and Mustang Monthly magazines. I would reccomend this book to anyone as a solid information guide."
2,101 Vendor Advertisements...very little help,"As an owner of a similar book for a 911 (""101 Projects for Your Porsche 911"") I purchased ""101 Projects for Your Mustang 1965.5-1973"" expecting it to be an additional reference for my Mustang Shop Manual. Where the Porsche version actually provides technical tips and troubleshooting recommendations, the Mustang version acts as an advertisement for vendors and restoration services. It provides very little help for the DIY restorer."
4,Great Golf Set for Beginners,"This golf set and bag are what I expected for the price. Not professionaly made, but still a great set for beginners looking to try to learn."
4,My Grandson loves it!!,Fast response and shipping. My grandson loves it and at age seven nearly parred a very long par three. I wion't be able to take him with me anymore; I am afraid he going to start beating me!!
4,Great set of clubs for the money,We got this set for my son for Christmas. I put the golf mat in the basement and let him go to town hitting balls at the wall. He isn't very accurate yet so the club hits the mat a lot and they have held up nicely. They seem to be the perfect size and weight for him right now. He's not struggling to get the club around.
2,Came broken,I GAVE THESE CLUBS TO MY LITTLE GRANDCHILD. ONE CLUB SHAFT WAS BROKEN UNDER THE GRIP SO I DIDN'T NOTICE IT UNTIL SHE TRIED TO USE IT ABOUT A MONTH LATER. I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY REQUESTED AND THEY SAID THEY WOULD SEND A REPLACEMENT CLUB. THAT WAS A WEEK AGO AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE REPLACEMENT OR A CONFIRMATION THAT IT HAS BEEN SENT. I AM TRYING TO DISPUTE THE CHARGE NOW.
3,"Good 60's Folks, preview of talent to come!","Good solid folk albumn. It's a good lead in to his current work. His later and current stuff is better If you can find ""Ghost's on the Road"" get it!!"
1,Not the Best of...,"I am not from this era, but I love good folk music and Eric Andersen has produced some great stuff over the years, but this is not his best. Yes, the songs are good, but they are ""overproduced"". If you are looking to get introduced to Eric or looking to catch up on his music, then I would recommend 'Bout Changes and Things. Many of the songs overlap from the two albums, but the versions on 'Bout Changes are more folkie, finding just Eric and his guitar. He may not be the best guitarist or vocalist, but he is definitely worth having in your collection."
5,Critical Race Theory,"So far, great book. It really makes you think about your own life history and view points on race."
1,Who said Marxism was dead?,"Critical Race Theory in short is Marxist Critical Theory (most notably from the Frankfurt School) applied from class to race. This alone should set off alarm bells in people. Marxist theory requires that one side is necessarily a monolithic oppressor and that the other side(s) is necessarily the innocent victim. Such thinkers have heavily inspired the victim industry, the shakedown industry, and modern political correctness witch hunt. Beware of anything that comes from Marxists. Marxists, except those of the puritanical variety, enjoy such works. Those of you who aren't Marxists and stumbled upon this tripe and are influenced by it are what Lenin referred to as ""useful idiots."""
1,Horribly twisted and disgusting,"This book not portrays every white person in America as a racist, but does so in a racist manner itself. The book cites almost no facts to prove its assertions that whites are inwardly racist because of their being white, and that radical measures such as affirmative action across the board (in jobs, schooling, housing, etc.) needs to become common practice to ""overcome the disadvantages of being Black."" The book claims to want to help all poor members of society, but mentions poor whites only in passing. The book does not effectively prove any of its claims, instead using obviously exaggerated and unlikely examples to make a point. This book only incited anger in me, not sympathy for the ""poor Black man."""
5,a long delayed gem,"I love this CD... it was recorded in 1995, yet not released until 2000. I'm not sure why, but that was a shame. Rez Abazi is an excellent, and underrated, guitarist. He displays many different sounds on this CD. Another thing that is great about this music is that no 1 player in this quartet dominates throughout the album. Often times on many jazz recordings, the brass or woodwind instrument (in this case the saxophone) overwhelms the other players, not so here. Highly recommended."
3,it's ok,"after reading this book, my biggest fault with it was that it was too applied in nature, if you like this sort of thing then this is the book for you,"
1,"Very incomplete infomation, and loaded with typo's","In an attempt to find missing information from this book, I have found this forum to review it. This is one of the poorest quality technical manuals I have ever seen, or attempted to use. In one instance for example, on compression testing on page 83, the text refers you to the Tune -Up Specifacations chart in chapter 2 for the compression pressure specifacation, and it is simply not there. I have spent numerous hours trying to find information that is simply not there. This is particularly annoying, as the whole point to this type of book is to save time. There are many other areas of missing and and incomplete information, such as interpeting trouble codes stored in the ECM.Even though the manual refers you to them, they simply are not included in the manual at all!! There are also numerous typo's in this manual. That can generally be worked around with a little effort. However, missing information is simply inexcusable!!"
2,Bad Mistake,"Went my parnents first bought our S-10 they purchased this book very short after. I did not like this book so I then I went bought Hayes book for S-10s. That is went I discovered a misprint in the Chilton's book a bad mistake. The mistake is on the 2.8liter the firing patern they show is for a 4.3,and the firing patern 4.3 they show is the one for the 2.8. I hope they have corrected this problem. Note: They have own our S-10 for Ten years now. It has always been there for us very reliable."
1,"Chilton's Repair Manual : Chevy S-10 Gmc S-15 Pick-Ups, 1982","Yo compre este manual pensando, que contenia toda la informaci√≥nnecesaria para la reparacion de S10, pero en realidad esta muyincompleta, y le faltan muchos datos tecnicos, yo realmente nolorecomiendo."
2,Not the best toy.,"Don't get me wrong, we really like Thomas the Tank. However, this is not a great toy. The handle comes off way to easy and it arrived with batteries like it said but they don't work and they are specialty batteries (like watch batteries) so we still don't have batteries. For the price get something else."
3,Cute but Handle comes off too easily,This is a cute toy but the handle does come off too easily. My little boy walks but everytime he trys to push this toy the handle the handle comes off. He does like to just play with the thomas on the floor. You can proberbly find something better for the money.
2,No Bubbles,"My 2 year old son received this for a birthday gift and loved it at first, but there are very few bubbles that come out of it. After 10 minutes of pushing it around and only getting 5-10 bubbles every minute or so he got frustrated with it and has not played with it since."
2,"Nice, but flawed","This roller is really nice in concept and is attractive and sturdy. Moreover, it does give a nice massage. However, the one I received suffered from two flaws. (1) Since there was no rubber track and the wood was smooth, it slipped very easily. (2) The other edge had a slightly greater diameter than the inner edge, so instead of rolling straight down my spine, it would roll in an arc. Both of these requiring me to contort my arms to continually adjust the roller, which I ultimately returned. I ended up purchasing theBody Back Company Back Rollerinstead, which I've been pretty happy with."
4,A good laugh,The characters mix in and out of top artists singing some Western favorites. You won't play it everyday but when you need a laugh it is alot of fun.
5,Adoption from both perspectives,"A Bear Named Song--The Gift of a Lifetime is one of, if not the best book for children on the sub- ject of adoption that I have ever read. The first part of the book, in which a girl sacrifices a favorite doll so that a less advantaged girl can have it puts us in touch with the birth mother's perspective. In my own experience with open adopt ion, my daughter's birth mother had the exact same feelings described in the book. The second half of the book is from the perspective of the adoptive parent and the adoptee, and it is a very accurate account of the feelings of all concerned. It is all very touching and I must admit that no matter how many times I read it, I always cry."
3,Sturdy filter,"Not an expert in filters, but the construction of this product is pretty sturdy and seems like it will last a while. Never did any DIY work on my 06 civic, and seems fun to change a filter!"
2,Maybe I Got a Knockoff,"Interesting most of the reviews say the performance(hp) of the engine improves and the mpg stays about the same. I would say my performance stayed about the same and my mpg went down a good 2-3 mpg. I am rather disappointed by this product in how it has mostly hurt the performance of my 2008 Civic. I suppose you can do worse, but like maybe those other products that are supposed to do great things for your car(like oil additives), just save the extra $40-50 and replace your air filter with any ok one every 50,000 and you will be allright. I can't recommend the K&N."
3,Great for a disorganized teacher,"I see that some reviews trashed this book. There are some things I disagree with also (especially about not having fun). But if you are a first year teacher or even a second year teacher that fell on his/her face a few times, this is a book for you. At my new school they sent us this book and then gave an orientation about its contents. Although most of it is common sense, Wong's ideas about procedures and expectation have made a world of difference in my classroom. I agree whole-heartedly about the dressing chapter. We as teachers get little respect because of teachers who wear jeans to work. It is not hard to look nice. We are professionals you know. So read the book, pick and chose your chapters and learn form it. You might not agree with everything but if you get a few solid ideas from the book, then it is worth it.By the way, it is easy reading and sometimes I felt like they wasted space by bulleting, large fonts, and repetition. But buy it anyway."
3,book for a class,"this product satisfied my need to buy the book for class.i do, however, find it very repetetive and fluffy"
4,Great Book!!!,This book has tons and tons of great tips and pointers on everything from classroom management to lesson plans. It is easy to read and to the point. It has strategies for grades K-12 so it is beneficial for everyone. Definitely must read!!!
5,"Excellent ""nuts & bolts"" for the beginning teacher","I recommend this book to anyone who is wondering ""Where do I start?"" in anticipation of their first day of teaching. Contains a great deal of practical advice. It helped me organize my thoughts on how to begin in a new school, and get off on the right foot."
5,Its As Good As I Thought It Would Be,"I had heard how good this book was and have been wanting to get it for awhile now. It is full of good ideas, and I like that is written in short snippets..not long drawn out chapters in which a lot of time is required to sort through the strategies."
3,Harry Wong,"This text was recommended to me by other seasoned teachers. I'm a first year teacher and found the amount of text to be a bit overwhelming, especially trying to plan for a new schoolyear. There are some valid ideas- and his videos are good. I also downloaded the CD to my MP3 player and listened to his talks while I was driving to school. The book is helpful- but may take a bit of time to get through."
5,Tool for Every Teacher,"This was a required book for a classroom management class. It turned out to be a GREAT addition to my 'toolbox'. I've used it on many occassions. It is not a book to read straight through, rather, you read what you need. Novel idea. Dr. Wong knowst the classroom and how to make the classroom experience best for both the student and the teacher.Great gift for that new teacher on your Christmas list."
4,LOVED IT!! (Especially Great for First Year Teachers),"I don't have professional teaching training however, I do have many friends that do. After reading this book and speaking to them also I realized this book is good for anyone interested in teaching, especially first year teachers. **This book teaches you things that they don't teach you in school** Easy to read, organized, and the main points are highlighted. It shows you everything from what to wear, how to arrange the classroom, where to stand, what to say. I loved it!!"
1,Not Great.,"After all of the hype, I really expected and hoped to find more than I did. This book is nothing great, and there are better ones out there.The main problem is while Wong may be a good speaker, this book is very vague and general, and not user friendly. More, the author seems to lack real ""hands on"" experience. For me, insight, advice and tips from someone who done the actual work and has been ""in the weeds"" (so to speak) themselves, is much more valuable than some one who just talks about it.Personally, I'd recommend Dr. June Stride's books over this one. Practical Strategies for Including High School Students and Street Smarts - A Drug Education and Prevention Program are two good ones."
5,A Perfect Book!!!,This is a perfect book for the new teacher!!!! Everyone new teacher I know has this book. Filled with great info from discipline to maintaining an effective classroom.
4,Good advice for all teachers,"As a ""newer"" teacher in middle America, I was anxious to read the Wong's book, especially since it has received rave reviews from every source! And it was a worthwhile purchase and easliy worth the hours I spent reading it. I will refer to you often. However, it is not the *only* book to read on this subject. For a full, well-rounded review of teacher advice, also check out Unauthorized Teacher Survival Guide by Jack Warner and If You Don't Feed the Teachers by Nell Conners. Buy and read all three and you will have a good start on your teacher education after college."
5,Harry Wong is the Best,"I am a new teacher and this book brought me insight into some aspects of teaching that I had never even thought of! I really enjoyed the CD with video of Harry Wong. He is such a wonderful speaker, I would love to see and hear him in person. I fully recommend this book for new and seasoned teachers of any age!"
5,A Must-Have,"No teacher should be without this book. Mr. Wong addresses issues they just don't teach in college. The title is a bit misleading, though. Any teacher, at any time of year will benefit from the advice given in ""First Days."""
5,Lynnstyr,"This book is informative and full of ideas even for veteran teachers. Written with compassion for the less experienced, the book deals with the workday problems of real teachers. This book offers many helpful ideas for becoming a really effective teacher and should be required reading for everyone entering the field of education."
4,More ideas,"Wong and Wong is a great resource for all teachers, but it is true that it is intended more for the elementary classroom. If you are looking for a practical guide, especially for new teachers, read A Lesson Plan for Teachers, New and Old. It is a more practical approach to the real incidents and experiences faced by seconday level teachers."
2,Childish Book,"Why are teacher's always treated like the children they teach? Teachers are smart, college educated, professionals. Yet no body would ever think this based on the books written about teaching for teachers. This book like so many is no different. It looks like a book for a child and it is written in much the same manner filled with no brainer facts and pictures. The only good advice offered in the book is about keeping the list of classroom rules short and making everything else a procdure. That is useful and helpful but the format of the book and dumbed down method in which Mr. Wong writes is awful. Read the $100,000 Teacher by Brian Crosby instead and learn what can be done to change this problem and to give teachers the respect they so very much deserve."
5,This is the most practical book for teachers I've seen.,"This book has shown me, a first-year teacher, the most effective ways to budget my time, energy and resources. There are so many valuable examples and suggestions for behavior management, procedures, setting rules, and overall ways to be a highly successful teacher. This selection goes beyond theory and actually shows the reader a path to take in order to be the kind of teacher that makes a positive impact on the lives of children, parents, and collegues alike. Reading this book decreased my anxiety in the few weeks before my first teaching experience, simply because it helped me realize exactly what I wanted my classroom to become. I highly suggest this to any teacher, new or veteran, as a refresher course in why we have chosen this career and how to be our best!"
2,There has got to be something better,"You would be better off just asking someone for a little advice. If you've actually been to elementary, middle, or high school at any point in your life, this book will provide only the tiniest morsel of wisdom to ease those terrifying days at the end of summer vacation before your first-ever class. This book would be great if it weren't for the sidebars, graphics, or text. Peruse the other reviews for more suitable recommendations.I gave it two stars simply because I imagine that there is someone out there just clueless enough to require Harry Wong to hold their hand for three hundred-odd pages of fluff. I fully intend to sell this book as soon as possible, so the two stars might do something for its resale value. Two very grudging stars."
1,waste of money if you have common sense,"if you have any common sense, this book is a waste of money. with advice like (paraphrasing)--be sure to smile at students--and your attitude will affect the students this book isn't worth the ""new"" price. this would be a good book for someone who has never set foot in a classroom, and lacks any self confidence in teaching.i found the book to be a waste of my money and time."
2,Skim it at the book store and that'll be enough,I have heard Harry Wong speak at a conference and was blown away. He spoke for three hours in front of thousands of teachers and kept us all engaged and laughing for the entire three hours. He is definitely a gifted speaker with a wealth of knowledge about teaching. But I must say his book was far less interesting. I was reluctant about this book at first as I was already an experienced teacher but it came so highly recommended that I thought I'd give it a chance. There are some good tips about teaching but there are too many redundant sidebars and footnotes. There are topics that could've been covered with a paragraph which Harry Wong goes on for an entire chapter. The lay out of the book looks colorful and busy but for reading and learning about effecting teaching - not so effective. I would not recommend this to beginning teachers or experienced teachers.
1,Useless drivel,"Not helpful at all--just the usual kind of packaged drivel with a catchy title. Real research and critical thinking skills are needed to improve education in this country, not cute slogans."
4,The First Days Of School: How To Be An Effective Teacher by Harry K. Wong,This book was brand new-still shrink wrapped-it took a little longer to receive (a couple of days) than another book I ordered the same day from a different vendor.
2,Not thrilled,"I was not as thrilled with this book as many people seem to be. I found the information in the book to be very generalized and vague. Additionally, what little specific information that is provided seems to be repeated over and over again in different chapters. I also found the layout of the book to be annoying with too many different graphics and fonts scattered all over the place! I think that this book is O.K. when used in conjunction with another, but I would not rely on this as my only source of information."
3,I hope there are better books out there,"I've read Harry Wong's book as have many teachers. This seems to be a popular giveaway to new teachers. The advantages of the book are that it does a good job of informing teachers of what they will face. I don't, however, feel it does a good job of preparing you to face your new job. Here are a few observations on the book:- Wong comes across as a know-it-all frequently- Wong judges the reader as if he knows the teacher in question.- Some of the strategies seem a bit hurtful to students.Finally, I am a high-school teacher, and while the book helps all teachers in theory, most of the practical, usefull applications suggested are immature and would get a secondary teacher laughed out of the classroom. If your students think you are a schmuck, they won't learn much."
1,"If This Book Is Right, I Want To Be Wong","This book is very redundant and presents ideas that are mundane and obvious. With chapter headings like ""The Purpose of School is Learning"" and ""Effective People Know What They Are Doing,"" the authors seem to be writing for elementary school students and not their teachers. I would recommend this book only if you like covers that have lots of pictures of teachers from the 80's."
3,A Good Starting Point; but like all books on teaching...,"A good jumping off point; but like all how-to books on teaching you have to pick and choose what you want from many sources. The section on classroom management was wonderful and I will use some of his ideas, but other ideas like shaking every students' hand at the door I will take a pass. That just isn't my style.Read it because it has some excellent ideas; but don't expect it to give you ideas for the rest of the school year. This book starts you off the first week of school with procedures and routines, and that's it. Aptly titled, in that respect."
4,A great book for beginning and veteran teachers!!,"Not only should beginning teachers read this book, but teachers who have been in the profession for many years should read it! I'm not sure why anyone would give this book a bad review. I would have to admit, I thought some of the ideas were a bit absurd when I was a pre-teacher (as many are who are giving bad reviews), but as someone who has been in the classroom (and various classrooms, at that), Mr. Wong's ideas and teaching methods are effective and are MUCH NEEDED IN TODAY'S SOCIETY!"
5,Best book ever for classroom management,"I realized early in my teaching career that punishment in the classroom was counterproductive, and that rewards never did engender the kind of commitment to order that I wanted. A friend told me about The First Days of School, and my teaching began to improve from that day on. Establishing a culture of mutual respect from the first day is the clue to success. I bought this book for a young friend who's experiencing the chaos that breaks out from time to time in a person's career."
2,Outdated and Superficial,"It was hard to get through this book with all of its cheesy quotes and outdated layout. I think that there has to be other resources out there that can cut to the chase in a more readable way.Some of the advice is solid, though it comes off as gimicky in some ways. I suppose that the book is good for those who need a quick fix management system to get them started, but to build a truly caring and effective class community teachers need to dig deeper than what Wong offers here."
4,The First Days of School - Wong,"This book is simple yet very effective in helping the novice or the seasoned teacher. I read it, took notes, and am applying what I learned."
5,I am a first year teacher...,I thank God someone advised me to read this book. I would not have been prepared. This is a must have for every teacher and anyone contemplating teaching.
5,Brand new.,Thanks for the book. I've searched book stores for a while and they never had it in stock. It was nice to find a new book still in it's package cheaper than any book store.
1,"Wow, what a disappointment!","All the 5 star ratings are really misleading. This book does alot of talking about ""HOW THINGS SHOULD BE"", but does not give much advice on how to do the things it talks about. This book is 300 pages of ""no-brainer"" stuff! Sorry all you five star people, but I was not impressed. The graphics and lay out of this book take up most of the space, and it is so busy it is distracting to read."
2,PollyAnnaEducation,Mr Wong is making a good living selling his book and working the lecture circut. Some good ideas but a lot of impractical stuff included. The reality of the classroom and the ineffectiveness of school administration make working under such ideal circumstances unrealistic. Work in 5 classes of 40-50 kids each day who can't read (many are moved up so they can be with their friends) and such touchy feely programs quickly fall aside.
4,Practical Resource!,"My school system purchased this book for every teacher. As a veteran teacher, I would have never read it otherwise. I find that this book is a quick, easy read, and I love to read it every summer to prepare for the upcoming school year. The information is useful for establishing procedures in a classroom. (It's that teacher handbook that I wish I had had when I entered the profession.)While reading, I have to get past the obvious nature of some of the suggestions. I feel as though I've stepped into the past because Wong sounds very ""old school."" But his methods for lesson mastery are right on the money -- and hardly antiquated.The layout of the book makes it easy to locate information that is relevant, and to ignore what isn't. I recommend this book for first year teachers AND for anyone who needs a boost in the classroom."
3,Not excited,"I thought that the book would be somewhat of a good source for new teachers,but it was repetitive. I was looking for more ideas. It used so many analogies and definitions. I just wanted some ideas on what to do on the first days of school, like I thought I was going to get. I did find some of it helpful."
3,1days,It was ok it came in promptly only thing is it was used and written in but hey I still got my use of the information inside. I would definitely recommend this book.
5,Fool-proof!,"100% fool-proof way to run your classroom. The Wong's have it figured out, for sure. Simple to implement and maintain, and makes life SOOO much simpler!"
5,Excellent resource,This is a good resource for beginning teachers. I have read this book myself and a have ordered it for several students teachers.
1,Nothing but a bunch of platitudes,"Aside from the absolutely garish design of the book that makes it nearly impossible to read, it has absolutely NO SUBSTANCE!!!All it is is a bunch of platitudes. Over-used statements about what makes a good teacher, without any explanation about how to become one.Also, for a book titled ""The First Day of School,"" it never actually tells you what to do on the first day other than smile a whole lot.What an absolute waste of time and money. The people who gave this book positive reviews must all be new teachers who don't know what they're talking about. I've been teaching for eight years and thought this might give me some new ideas, but it didn't."
3,Wong is wrong for Middle or High School but Okay for Elementary...,A bit too corny for Middle and High School but Elementary teachers may find it useful.
1,waste of money,These people live in fairy land. They need a dose of reality. Their suggestions are not applicable in the real world.
5,Great Quality,"The book that I ordered came very quick, and it is in really great condition. I am really satisfied with the product that I received."
4,Very Good!!,"Came in when I least expected, really fast and that's great for people who have deadlines for an assignment."
3,First Day of School - timely purchase,I would purchase a product from this seller again. This came in a timely manner.
4,This is not a recipe book!,"If you are looking for a poster of rules to duplicate and use, please look elsewhere.This book is about refining your own personal style, how to steal ideas from other teachers, and how to be the best possible teacher ever! No book can tell you what to do, and this one does not. It instead gives the reasons for you to teach well, and how to go about doing that. You must act on your own to create your materials and make your classroom function.I have found this book to be very inspiring, it does not talk down or denigrate the teaching profession. If you can't accept criticism, this isn't for you. If you feel that blue jeans and a t-shirt are always appropriate for teaching, look elsewhere. If you want to be a professional in a demanding profession, then try this one out. Read it with your collegues, check out the videotapes (your distric or COE probably has them.Enjoy!"
1,"Same old, same old","Yet another ""authoritative"" tome on behavior modification. The title of the book made it sound interesting, but upon closer scrutiny its tired, teacher-in-control theme reared its ugly head. It's amazing that years after more effective models of classroom management have been devised, implemented, tested and their effectiveness confirmed (both by teacher/administrator evaluations...AND independent research studies), the Skinnerian behavior modification model still reigns supreme. If you must buy this book, do yourself a favor and also check out Beyond Discipline by Alfie Kohn and/or Teacher Effectiveness Training by Dr. Thomas Gordon -- then make up your own mind."
2,Assigned?,"If this volume is assigned, as it was in my case, our opinion doesn't matter. I find Highlights Magazine for children to be a more penetrating look at ANYTHING than this revenue generator. Good luck, sorry if you, too were required to buy it."
3,for elementary school,"This is OK for someone going into elementary school initially. However for higher grades it is lacking. When you are dealing with keeping butts in seats, where the desks are arranged is irrelevant."
4,good basic advice,"This book will give you the first steps...if you are just starting out. Helpful hints, such as setting class rules, attendence procedures, how to start the day and the school year. Most of the examples are very specific and useful...if this is your first year teaching, I believe this book will be a great resource.This book encourages you to take responsibility for preparing a learning environment, and for challenging the student to take responsibility for participating in the learning experience. I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned Wong's assertion that school is not about fun activities. I believe there has to be a balance between challenge and interest."
5,Great book that gets down to the brass tacks of teaching.,I enjoyed this book tremendously. I had Harry K. Wong for an instructor in Biology more years ago than either of us would care to admit. When I saw the book I had to get it. I am a middle-aged woman getting her teaching license and I needed help in beginning a career so late in life. This book has given me confidence and resources to get and keep me going.
5,I give it as a gift to new teachers,This is one book that all teachers and perspective teachers should have and read. As the principal of a small rural school there is not always time to give new teachers all the hints and ideas that are important as they begin the year or their career. This book is one answer. There are so many good thoughts and ideas. I have read it myself and now give it to any new teachers we hire as well as career teachers who need to revitalize themselves in relation to teaching basics. It has been well received.
4,Continued existence guide for educators,"A good quote by Harry & Rosemary Wong to remember from the book: ""What you do on the first days of school will determine your success or failure for the rest of the school year. You will either win or lose your class on the first days of school."""
5,"Delivered as promised, in great condition...",I received the book as promised and it was in great condition. I was given a timeframe of when the book would arrive and it arrived in that timeframe. It was also nicely packaged. I would order from again.
5,First Days of School - a must for all teachers,"What a godsend this book has been for me! If only all colleges would use it as their classroom management textbook, there would be a lot more successful first year teachers. This is not a book about the theorists and why this method works or that one doesn't, it is a book about how to make those first days of school organized and set the tone for the rest of the year. It is about how to maintain your composure even when you want to strangle the little darlings! :-) There are countless tips, tricks and tools to help every teacher make their classroom run smoother and let the teacher go home feeling full of energy instead of drained and exhausted.It's simply wonderful!"
2,Stop gushing...,"I had some pretty high expectations for this book and after reading it I must say I'm fairly disappointed. Several criticisms, not one of which is that this book is targeted to elementary school teachers (i.e.,larger customer demographic). Also I couldn't get over the condescending nature of the writing. I feel like I'm 16 years old and Dad is giving me a lecture on how to handle the ol'Buick on my big date. This book DOES have some great ideas but the all of the hype as well as certain unnerving flaws ( of which I only mention two!) prevent me from thinking it the Bible so many others do."
1,Good for those who don't have a degree in education!,Don't waste your money! Our district bought this about 8 years ago for all the new teachers and it is pointless and they are sitting on shelves going to waste! It discusses the obvious things you would have learned in your first education class or not even - most is common sense! There are many books out there that are excellent and I refer to often- this is not one of them! I can't believe it keeps coming up in Amazon's recommended!
2,Metaphores & Platitudes,"What a disappointment this book was! Fully one half of the book is devoted to metaphores of good teaching. The target readers are teachers - We get it! The other half of the book tells us the general differences between great teachers and horribly incompetent teachers. We get that, too! What's lacking in this book are realistic scenarios with detailed suggestions for making the best of them. This book was recommended by a colleague and I was looking forward to some insights on making my classroom better. All I got were platitudes."
3,Not a bad book for the first teacher but still leaves something to be desired...,"I bought this book before going overseas to teach English. I had never taught before and thought the advice would be useful.The advice is useful, but most of it is common sense: Don't let the kids get out of control and establish rules the first day; say ""hello"" to your students everyday; be prepared; etc.If you really are at a loss for teaching and have no experience with kids than yes, get this book. It's wonderfully laid out and even funny at times. But if you are teaching, skip it.But you don't have to take my word for it."
5,Buy used,"I purchased the item because it was a game that i liked. Since it is short, you are probably better off buying a used one. I bought one in ""good"" condition and apparently it was. So it was great. The seller sent it in 5 days and received fast shipping. I am happy"
2,"new game,but bad","Trust me this game is not as good as you think it is.It's cool that you get to walk around,and control the god cards,but you got to give them back to ishizu.And the card effects are not even right.And you need exp.points so you could have good cards in your deck.If I were you I would get the Yu-Gi-Oh game stairway to the destine duel world wide edition game(which I ready got).I hope this review was helpful enough."
4,IT SUCKS,This game is that bad. You can only duel 20 people once unless you wan to fight Marick over and over. You don't ever get all of the god cards. There are no effect monsters ether.
1,Just bad....,"I love yu-gi-oh. Im a big fan but this game is just bad. I work next to a videogame story and bought this one without even trying it. I play the card games, but never played dark duelist story games. The card system is a total joke. If you played the last yugioh game for GBA, play the card game, or watch the series you will be very dissapointed by how weird and illogical this whole thing is. The yugioh card game is great but they decided not to use the same rules. What a peice of junk. Well at least I can trade it in"
2,THIS GAME WAS SSSSSSSSOOOOOO EASY!!!,hi im a kid who loves and i mean LOVES yu gi oh but this gamewas SSSOOOOOOOO EASY!!! i mean yeah it was cool and stuff but ireally hated this game!!! and whats the deal with not beingable to save at the end of the game! i do not reccomend thisgame because its a BIG waste of thirty/twenty dollars so doNOT get this game!!! i mean yeah i got it used so i didnt getthe cards.(WELL THAT REALLY STUNK!)and i beat Marik/Malikwith a PUNY deck!!!
4,Dark Duel Stories all over again,"Yes, you get the god cards. Yes, its like an rpg. but the duels themselves are atrocious. they even use the real rules! they shouldve stuck with the WWE and EDS game play. I suggest World Wide Edition instead of this game.telling the truth on everything yugioh- Kajom"
1,cheaper by the dozen,if i were you i'd not buy this game you can get it at alote cheaper price for only less than 12.00
2,Well....,"Not great, the AI's are awful, most of the cards that are famous for their effects like Morphing Jar and Magician of Faith have NO effect, Spell/Traps are almost useless, your deck throughout the game is pitiful, Even IF you get a good card Your not allowed to use it until you've battled the same cheap AI's Over and Over.The reasonI was generous enough to rate it 2 stars was for the story it followed...."
3,"Not bad, but not very good either.","If you're an avid fan of the trading card game, this game is probably worth it for the 3 promo cards you get in it (perfectly ultimate great moth, riryoku, and negate attack). But if you're looking for a gaming experience like Worldwide edition, look elsewhere.This game does not comply fully with the trading card game rules, opting to settle for an RPG-style game using the interface from Dark Duel stories, that has been slightly modified. The game is kinda short, and really annoying when it comes to restricting the cards you can use in the game.I, personally, got bored with the game quickly and don't play it anymore.If you're a rabid fan of every little schlocky piece of Yu-Gi-Oh merchandise, by all means buy it. But serious duelists will either want to look elsewhere, or get it for the promo cards. Believe me, It's probably cheaper than getting the cards a la carte from some hobby site."
4,Keena70 says: Awesome!!!!,"I don't know how many girls are into Yu-Gi-Oh!, but I'm one of them! My sister, dad and I really like the show, game and cards(except for me because I LOVE it all). I was surprised I could actually walk around in this game. I'm still building my Dragon, Divine, Magician, and Warrior deck.It follows the T.V. show(depending on how far in the show you watched). I haven't gotten too far in the game yet, but this is definetely one of the three best games I'm obssessed with. I haven't found any faults yet, so I'm assuming this is one of the greatest and most Perfect games out! You get three cards with it, as with many Yu-Gi-Oh! games: Negate Attack, Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth, and Seiyaryu."
4,Awesome!,"This yugioh game is EXTREMELY fun. it is so fun that ever day i was at school i couldn't stop thinking about it. The game starts out with you being a duelist that is friends with yugi and joey. You perticibate in the Battle City Tourtoment and duel many framiliar duelist, Bones, Espa Roba, Rex Raptor, Mako, Weevil, Ishizu, Kaiba, and many, many others. The game was pretty easy for me, even Kaiba was a no brainer. A cool part is that you get egyptian god cards and you duel marik's rare hunters like, arkana, the exodia guy, odion, the mime dude, and joey being taken over. My problems started was when i got to the finals, the first duel took me six tries to win! But somehow the last duel in the game, it took me 2 tries to win! But anyway overall, this game is pretty good and i like this the second most of all that i have tried with gameboy advanced yugioh games."
2,Only good for the promos,"This game was disapointing because its like DARK DUEL STORIES (DDS) for GBC. It has some new cards like revival jam that is the best card with a good attack and good effect. I beat the game and you cant get The winged dragon of ra. You can get Slifer the sky dragon and Obelisk the tormentor. Thats it. No RA. World Wide has better cards,graphes and ect. I like the Forbidden Memories for Playstation better because it has alot better graphs even though its an older game."
1,Dissapointing,"The walking around in battle city is really the only good part. The dueling has totally gone down back to dds times. almost none of the monsters have affects! cyber jars, man eater bugs, and witch of the black forests and everything else that have good effects dont do anything. there are almost no trap and magic cards and everyone has extrememly weak monsters like 900 atk. you cant even use strong monsters until you duel like a million times because you need points and its really dome. dont buy this. eternal duelist soul was much better."
4,SHORT!!! but fun.,"I bought the Yu-Gi-Oh! Worldwide Edition, and am still playing it. When I bought this one, I was thinking it would be more like Worldwide. Boy was I off. It's more like pokemon. Not that it's a bad game, but I bought it on a Sunday, played it off and on at work and home, and beat it by Wednesday, then sold it back to the place I bought it from the next Saturday. It was just a bit to quick for me.It was harder to win duels, what with the ""points levels"" and ""Gaming Level"", and kinda annoying having to do everything in a certain order. Not like Worldwide, where you could play anyone in you first game.I would still recommend buying it, as part of the series, play it, enjoy it, and be done with it."
1,I can't beleive they went backwards,"I was hoping to get the best of both worlds when I bought this game. I thought with it being in an RPG atmosphere, it would be great. However, they went back to the crappy card rules of DDS. If they would have kept the same rules as WWE, and incorporated the RPG aspect, this would have been the greatest game ever. But the walking around is definitely not worth the bad style of card playing. If you are looking for an accurate representation of the actual card game, play World Wide Edition."
2,horrible game,This is the worst game ever. The Game is based on the YU-GI-Oh show. The good thing is you can walk around. The duling is like (DDS) the cards do not do what they really do. It is easy to win but it is hard to get locater cards. NEVER BUY THIS GAME! IT IS A WASTE OF $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.
1,this game sucks,"my god, i plyed this game and it was terrible! I mean come on it is crap! you start out crappy and you never get better cards, and when you do get better cards you can't use them. So my advice dont buy this game"
4,Yuhioj,"Hey,If the is like WWE Stair Way TO destany Duel then its gonna be great. When I saw more monsters and more battle city I think man its great!"
3,no girl?,you battle everyone in battle city and you gain expereance i beat the game but then it called me a 'he' you know there girls play too. Beside that it was fun.
4,Yugioh The Sacred Cards,"Yugioh The Sacred Cards is an RPG, which it's why it isn't really good. The graphics aren't really great. The game play is easy, but kinda boring. In my opinion the best thing about the game is that it brings 3 Limited Edition Cards. (Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth, Riryoku and Negate Attack) The Sacred Cards is basically Dark Duel Stories with better graphics. Being an RPG, it has a story. You must compete in Battle City, (again) finding Duelists and challenging them. You have to get 6 Locator Cards, and the Duelists who give them to you are incredibly easy to beat. All in all, it's fun, but way too easy. (at least for me) I you want it, buy it. But if you do, don't expect to be entertained for a long time. The max. you can play it is 2 hours. Konami should have at least changed the DDS Duel System if you ask me."
4,This game is great!,"It's really easy to beat because duelists have really weak decks. The graphic's are good, and you can walk around. The hardest part is collecting the Locater Cards. I have spent over 7 hours on this game, total, and haven't beatin` it yet. I suggest you try buying the strategy guide for this game, it really helps!"
4,cool story bad gameplay,"I played the Japan version of this game an I think that the story of this game is cool because it fallows the Battle City Episodes.What I didn,t like about this game is how you duel.The dueling is even worst than Dark Duel Stories.At the end of the game the strongest level 4 monster in my deck was the Witch of the black Forest and she doesn't have any effect and you need exp. points to have stronger monsters in your deck."
1,horrible game,This is the worst game ever. The Game is based on the YU-GI-Oh show. The good thing is you can walk around. The duling is like (DDS) the cards do not do what they really do. It is easy to win but it is hard to get locater cards. NEVER BUY THIS GAME! IT IS A WASTE OF $$.
4,Not too shabby,"I was quite impressed with this game but it had a few down points:1.) The game was too short, as soon as you got on Kaiba's blimp I thought I was going to face the big five like in the program but instead once you defeat Marik you give the God Cards to Ishizu and the game ends. So you never get to use the God Cards and once the game ends you can't carry it on, collecting the cards.2.) At the beginning of the game your opponent uses predictable moves like all of them placed one monster, face down in defence mode. The game only gets challenging when you face Weevil.If you like a short and snappy game this one if for you."
2,THIS GAME SUCKS,This game is only for children under the age of 10 and amatuer adults who think the show is the only way to play the game. I have lost all respect for Konami with the release of this stinker and I am very sorry I spent any kind of money on this title. Stick to original card game!
4,Oro?,"This is definately the best GBA YGO game out, if only because you can use Slifer and Obelisk (but not Ra!). The game returns to the duelist level and points version of DDS. Also, you can't use many cards, and things like Monster Reborn only bring back the thing you just killed in your OPPONENT'S graveyard. You cannot use Ra because Marik is the last person you duel. Yugi Oh (Dark Yugi) gives you Slifer the Divine Dragon after you beat him (Right before you beat Marik). At the end, you give the gods BACK to Isis (Ishizu)! Then the game ends. Boom. It's over. Other than that, the game is very good."
5,cant wait!!!!!!!,this is gonna be a great game you get to walk aroud and fight way more deulest than the old game and you can use the egyptain god cards
2,It an ok game,This game is fun. It has a new way of dueling but it's still fun. You can go againsts alot of people. Most are easy 2 defeat. Also you can use the Egyptian God Cards :). The first u get is Oblisk by defeating Kiaba. The end is dumb though because you have to give the God Cards back to Ishisu Ishtar. I beat it in 1 day and it only took my like 3 hrs. i really like the game but it would be a lot easier to rent this game instead of buying it.
4,yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.,I beat this game 9 times I got so bored I don't even play it any moreP.S thats because I lost it
1,Unsatisfactory,This game is the absolute worst. The only reason i gave it a 1 star rating is because they do not allow the option to give negative number ratings. Do Not Buy This Game.
1,The worst game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I hated this game so much I sold it the 4th day I got it! It was so short but the cards that itcomes with are good. Otherwise it sucked!!!!
1,Don't even bother,"There is no reason you'd buy this game. Sure you can walk around the city, but the dueling system is the same as DDS, so if you like DDS, buy DDS. This game is the same except it's a couple bucks more, and it will not give you your money's worth. PS, the 3 Promo cards are Perfectly Ultimaite Great Moth (More or less useless) Riryoku (the only decent part, but not worth getting the game for) and Negate Attack (I've seen better) so there you have it. I await the next Duel Monsters game."
1,xsbnhzsh,Boo. This is a freakin boring and stupid game.The wwe game was like so much better.Overall crappy.Rather do something better.you might as well throw your $30 bucks down the drain.YAWN....
3,A allright game.,"I bought this game a week or 2 ago and it's ok. They shouldn't have changed the rules( most monsters don't have effects when they really should). They should have done it to were it's basicly like WWE: SDD but with the god cards being in use. One good thing about it was the cards are really good. If you are collecting the cards and have a GBA, get this, otherwise it's your choice really."
4,The Sacred Game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This Game is a blast I saw it in ToysRus and I Knew it was a Must have to all Yu-Gi-Oh FAns!!!! People This game is really fun I could have given it 5 stars but since most monsters just have the attack and defence power of hundreds only.........well...it makes this game a little bit less fun but still this is a MUST BUY TO YUGIOH FANS!!!! To new people on yugioh i would say buy cards and play with the cards first.Then you play this game
4,Konami's First Yu-Gi-Oh! GBA RPG is Awesome!,"Okay, this game is fun, I'll give it that. However, when I tried to tamper with my deck, it wouldn't let me. I got stuck at the ""Starts at 9:00"" part. You have to walk around, challenging all the main duelists (i.e.: Espa Roba, Bonz, Yugi Motou). Then, you have to figure out where everyone is hiding! (Tip: Go to the Graveyard to challenge Bonz. He is easy and you'll nab a locater card from him with ease.) The duels are too easy; mostly because the duelists usually just play low-def.monsters face-down. I would have given it 3 stars, but the bonus rare cards (Perfect Ultimate Great Moth, Riryoku, and Negate Attack) included in the box are great. Thumbs-up to this great Yu-Gi-Oh game!"
3,Very good game BUT SHORT!,"This game was very good, but too short. It had all the aspects of the show, including the egyptian god card, but ends before the third is aquired. Although it was extremely good and fun, I finished it in three days!"
2,Way overpriced.,"I chose this bullhorn hoping to get something less likely to break from cheap construction. Years ago I bought one on Amazon for about $30 and it was decent, but broke within a year (because the plastic isn't the best).When I saw this for $100 with good reviews, I figured I'd try for quality this time around. Big mistake, this unit is almost identical in construction quality, power & range to bullhorns costing 1/3 as much. As far as I'm concerned, I just got ripped off for $70.Sometimes, you don't get what you pay for."
4,Destination ---- Fabulous!,"this is a great CD compilation, however, I only really cared for CD1 which contains all the downtempo Chill and Lounge stuff. CD2 contains upbeat dance tracks I didn't particulary care for, but what I got from CD1 more than made up for it. I'd buy it again just for CD1. This compilation turned me on to Tosca and more especially, to Llorca with their incredible track called ""The End"". Researched and bought the Llorca CD ""Newcomer"" b/c I loved ""The End"" so much. and that too, my friends, would be a very worthy investment."
3,For math people,"if you plan to learn a little Dif Eq on your own find another book, if it's for a class don't worry about it. this book is definitely difficult to learn from on its own but paired with a good teacher it is a valuable resource. this book is full of poorly explained examples but the plethora of problems makes up for it. basically find a good teacher learn the material do as many problems as you can and the ones you can't do go to your teacher and ask them how... make sure you understand it i am a math tutor and even i had a tough time with this book also i found a few typos just in the first few chapters. so if you are learning on your own try a different text book but this one is full of good problems from which you could benefit from doing."
1,Pointless,"This text is expensive and pointless. While it is obviously designed for upper division courses, it lacks concrete examples and a clear thought pattern. Sections do not seem to connect in a comfortable way and they should be much longer. The odd-numbered solutions pages at the end are a joke; most say ""proof not shown."" Do not buy."
4,"Student's Solution Manual for Diff. Eqs.: Theory, Technique and Practice","The solutions manual is fine, with a clear analysis of the problems discussed in the text. I thought that more problems should have beenlooked into, but many math books don't provide solutions to all of the problems they offer. Answers help those trying to fully understand the text material. We shouldn't be working in the dark when we try to solve the problems."
1,Point Less,This solutions manual is point less. It's just like look for answer in the back of your book.
3,Beautiful book,"This is a very nice book, filled with beautiful photos of horses, farms, and the world of racing."
4,good game,"Star Trek Voyager Elite Force is quite fun. I have enjoyed it thoroughly. The only thing negative is that the ""used"" product did not come with a CD key which means I cannot play it online. However, given the age of the game, it is likely that no one plays it online anyway. The single player is a lot of fun and it was well worth buying."
5,Star Trek version of Jedi Outcast,Well kind of... if u played JK2 be4 this... wish I have. Its fun. I lept into it. Its almost easy... but the Borg are hard to kill with their shields (I use god... don't contraadict me!!) this game is awesome!
4,Awesome Multiplayer SciFi - So-so Single Player,"Finally, a Star Trek game worth it's jewel case.First, yes, the single player game is REALLY short. I actually finished it start to finish on one Saturday. Adding to the pains of the single player game are the seemingly hours of cut scenes, so many that the story almost becomes distracting to the gameplay.And, yes, the ending is sooo cheeseball. You know, evil laughing big alien you have to kill. Same ol'.That being said, Elite Force is the best FPS I've played since Half-Life. The graphics and detail are terrific, the gameplay is great (albeit short) and the voice acting is relatively good.But the real beauty in EF is the multiplayer! Fast, easy and competitive, Elite Force has taken over for Unreal Tournament as the FPS of choice for me.Buy the game for a couple days of single player fun and then work on those death matches!"
4,"Impressive ""Trek"" game, the best one in years","Well, this is my second review of this game, and it's still impressive although a bit too easy. I just got into playing it a week ago, after upgrading my computer with the 3-D Voodoo card. It only took me that long to beat it. The only thing left to do now is enjoy the holodeck adventures either alone or with someone on-line. That's always the sad part about a game; when you've beaten it. I know it has to happen sooner or later, but this seemed like a very short time compared to other games. Oh, well. The holodeck adventures are still there, thank goodness.Still, a must have for all fans alike."
5,Great,"Well everything technical has been said and it's a wonderful game, although a little confusing at first.But my favorite part is when you chose your favorite character (B'ellana) and use her/him to shoot at characters you hate (Chackotay,Seven and Neelix for example).All in all it's a good game."
5,Arrrgh! Fun! Innovation! Graphics! Trek!,"Yes, this is the game that has it all: graphics, sound, multiplayer, length, innovation, fun, and, it's TREK! Yes, this IS a Star Trek game, and unlike many Trek games, you WON'T be dissapointed with this amazing game! After you finish the 40 levels of single player, multiplayer will leave plenty more. Wait, what am I doing? I gotta go play it...now."
5,"The best ""Trek"" computer game ever!","Wow! This game is the greatest in the ""Trek"" games to be out for the PC. I've bought plenty of what's out there. Some have been good, and many have been bad, such as ""Klingon"". This has to be the best of all of them. They have really outdone themselves this time. The graphics are great, the sound effects superb. You almost feel as if you're actually in a television episode.The only mishap I had is when I purchased this game, I did not look at the box stating that a 3D card was required. My computer did not come with one when I bought it, so I had to do my first upgrade. It's only ... to get the Voodoo 3D card. Get that before you get this game, and you have it made.I only wish the other ""Star Trek"" games could be as impressive as this one."
4,Fun for Adults - Great For Kids,"Having loved the series Voyager I was expecting something different from this game. Now that the series is over I can still enjoy it in this simulation game.The graphics are great and the special sound effects and visuals are stunning. Still the people look a little mechanical (unreal), but the PIXAR technology is still a few years away to be put in out homes as of yet.The action is believable, the training is semi real and the charcaters are interactive. Seeing the ship is very cool as well. The younger people seem to like the color and interactivity of it.This is a good game to have!"
5,My Favorite Doc Watson,I have quite a few Doc Watson CD's but I think this one will be my favorite. All the songs are good ones and many are lively and fun to listen to. It's truly sad that both of these men have passed on now. I would recommend this one to anyone who is trying Doc for the first time and the collector also. I have listened to it a hundred times.
4,Only One Thing Missing,"Just so you know, folks, there was one advantage to the double-album vinyl release (Vanguard VSD - 9/10, 1970) and that's the inclusion of Hank Snow's song ""Movin' On"" between ""The Cloud's Are Gwine Roll Away"" and the instrumental ""Windy & Warm""; it was presumably removed because of the length of the album when transferred to the 80-minute CD limit. Admittedly, you don't miss much but those of you with turntables might want to keep an eye out for this one in the used record stores that are rapidly disappearing from the American landscape. For those without turntables, give thanks that this classic recording is available on CD because it's a true American treasure."
5,A documentary with songs,"This is actually more of an documentary in praise of Peter, Paul, and Mary. It is not a concert. There are songs, though, between each interview or clipping. I usually skipped the the words that were spoken, and listened to the words that were sung. The songs are good and I enjoyed them.As a tribute to these three, I think the DVD succeeded. And as a look into their music, I think the DVD succeeded as well. It is really hard sometimes to separate their activism from their songs. Are they not one and the same at times? The DVD certainly answers that question.For now, if you just want to listen to good harmony, get a good CD.If you want to take a look at the ""musical legacy"" of the trio, which involves their work in American civil and global rights, buy this DVD. If that turns you off, just enjoy the songs that are there."
5,Good reading!!,I purchased this book a couple of years ago. The author did a great job of wetting the appetite of an admirer of Madame Walker. The pictures were great and I look forward to passing it down to my children. The only downside to the book was that it didn't give any info as to what happened to the business after Madame Walker passed on and what happened to the grand daughter of Madame Walker. Madame Walker is an inspiration to me and was a remarkable woman.
4,how to tighten up your WiFi network,"Curran gives a timely warning to anyone setting up a WiFi network. It is so easy to inadvertantly leave it exposed to crackers. Exacerbated of course by the wireless nature of the network, which means that a cracker does not need to actually tap into a cable to gain access.The book explains in detail how to conduct wardriving. In part so that you can defend your network against this. But it explains that this can also be fun. Simply to drive around town with your laptop, and seeing who has open networks. Some of these may be accidental. But others may actually be for anyone to use. The latter especially is becoming somewhat common, as a movement has arisen to deliberately enable widespread WiFi access."
4,A Must-Have for All Pet Owners,"This easy-to-read book is an estate planning guide for pet owners. It offers a realistic approach to making arrangements for your pets when you are no longer around to take care of them. The thought of your pets being without you after your death can be worrisome. This book gives you concrete steps you can take to relieve that worry. It also provides resources so the reader can further investigate their options. It takes the phrase ""pet care"" to the next logical level."
3,Hmm,"Well both are cheap graphic novel movies. Nothing innovative or exciting, but they please my 4 & 8 year old grandsons and that was the purpose."
5,Batman,It's the animated series batman so I luv that anyway so this was A good deal I saw one of the movies at wal mart for the price of both
4,3 yrs. old,I bought it for my Batman obsess Godson. He wants every Batman movie there is; so why not buy two in one! He loves the fact that it has two different movies and he watches them both every time it goes in!
4,"Two great Batman films, So-So DVD","""Mask of the Phantasm"" and ""Subzero"" are two fine animated Batman films (two of the best animated films in general). But it's too bad that none of the DVD's, including this ""Double Feature"", have any interesting special features. There is lack of audio commentary, behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, etc. And the quality of the movies themselves are only mediocre: none of them have been digitally remastered. I'm hoping there will be Special Editions of these two movies soon. But until then, I'll enjoy these for what they are."
4,Batman & mr freeze movie,The dvd movie is awesome i love it both films bring me back when the animated series came on tv
3,This game is nothing compared to the original.,"The first Metal Gear Solid on PS was awesome. That game was mind blowing. And one of the best features it had was the music. It was incredible. This version completely did away with the music and did a whole new soundtrack which was a huge mistake. The graphics were better, but that still didn't make the game better. However, if you 've never played the original game on the PS, then you might want to check this game out."
1,Love the original masterpiece - I just wish I could say the same thing about Twin Snakes.,Let's face it - Twin Snakes blows. Anyone who says it's good is totally lying to themselves or has not played the original MGS1 for PS1.A majority of the cut-scenes were unnecessary and really stupid. Snake does some super-human moves that just ridiculous - this isn't The Matrix or some Steven Seagal movie.
1,This game sucks snakes,"I bought this game today and ten minutes later I was completely sick of it. The graphics are okay; the game play is straight out of 1995. I might have been impressed by this game ten years ago, but by to days standards it's weak! You have no control what so ever of the angles you view the game from, making the left control stick useless. This game's idea of stealth is hiding in a freaking locker while guard pass by. There's really no shadowing or anything to hide in. It's more movie and corny dialogue than game play. Don't believe all the phony hype surrounding this game; it's not the best game of the year. If you are a fan of the first MGS go ahead and buy it, if you're looking for a game like 'splinter cell' save your money. I wouldn't even accept this game as a gift."
4,Rockin' HARD! they've done it again!,"This game is great. There are some minor flaws, but don't let that distract you from the real gold. This game is put particularly well on the nintendo gamecube system. In fact, the GC discs have less memory than ps2. The game is formatted really well and a lot of features from sons of liberty were added in. The tranquilizer gun and the sniper gun have been included. the voices and everything is done well. the game has palm sweaty fun. although the cut-scenes are long, think of it as a break from your controller. I suggest that you rent this game before you buy it. never the less this is a game worth buying."
4,sams review,metal gear solid is a really good game it is devently worth buying if you have the cash. I would give it about 96% if it was me and if you see it for around 20 30 quid it is really worth it because it is such a amazing game
5,amazing,"it's the orginal but in an amazing new form. better graphics, new added intros. this game is just bloody amazing. the best remake ever!"
4,Nintendos new metal Gear,WOW! the AI is so much beter in this game. if u loved MG on PSX then you will love it on GQ the cool thing is when u fight psycho mantis and he tells u what u have in your memory card like hes reading your mind LOL the only thing I had get use to is the controller I wish I could use a PS controller then my fingers dont get in the way somtimes but its a Great Game just same game just new cut screens are sweet and looks and plays like Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty I think it is easyer than the PS one for the [money] why not!for me 9 out of 10
4,not as good as the 1st,because I liked the old music better it is allright I guess I liked it 1st person shooter to a 3rd person is good more to do
2,Long on story short on fun,"The Solid Snake game series had a reputation among my PlayStation friends that for years made me jealous. But when I heard that there would finally be a version for the GC I was so excited that I pre-order the game. After having played and won the game, however, I really have to wonder what the hype was all about. In terms of graphics, this is probably on the best games for the GC but the game play is almost nonexistent for a game that requires 2 discs. Fully two-thirds of the game is given over to cut scenes that last as long as 8-10 minutes and are horrible written. The overall plot line for the game is interesting and does have some very clever interactive moments but, the scenes you have to suffer through to understand what's going on are down right embarrassing. The controls are awkward and I never became comfortable with the game play.If you want to watch a bad movie, buy this game. If you are actually interested in playing a game, I say look somewhere else."
3,bad REmake...,"The REmake of the Original Metal Gear Solid on the PS1 wasn't supposed to be bad if it weren't for the bad Voice acting and redone music.the feel of thrill was gone when you first hear the music when Snake rides the Elevator to the Surface. Boos Fight music has gone...boring and excitement was gone. the PS1 version my have ""Limited"" capabilities, but the REAl action is in THERE!"
2,...bad remake,"The game over all is not that bad but there where some problems.The new cinamatics in the game take the realism out of the game,mainly where the sceen where grey fox cuts a block of the wall out and kicks it at snake.In stead of adding to the game it just makes it feel sappy.Also the the controls are verry glitchy and awkward wich seems to be the only chalange to the game.If you have played the first one you will be dissapointed in the cinamatics if you have played Metal Gear Solid 2 you will be dissapointed in gameplay and controls. Just stick with the original."
2,"Plays like the orignal, but doesn't hold true.","If you are a fan of the original you may be shocked to see what the cutscenes are like in this game. Snake finds himself jumping off of live missiles and doing cartwheels down hallways. You feel like you're watching Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon instead of an MGS cutscene. Snake is no longer a cool-headed soldier, but an overly aggressive maniac who points his gun at injured old men. That's aside from the slapstick humor that's been injected into every other cutscene.The gameplay is largely unchanged. You can now go into FPV and a few other features from MGS2 make it in. Other than that nothing has really changed. A few very minor level changes. If you are an old fan and can get over the cutscene and voice changes than you'll find the gameplay is fun like you remembered, if a bit too easy. Newcomers will have fun playing the remake of a masterpiece, but might find themselve confused by the story if/when they move onto other parts of the series."
2,TERRIBLE,"I will start by saying that first of all, the gamecube is the worst system in the world, and the Metal Gear Solid series is probly the best thing to happen to video games. OK.Twin Snakes is just a copy of Metal Gear Solid (PS1) it might have a few added parts and better graphics. but it it still the same game that we all played years ago. The only reason i gave the game any stars is becasue the original game rocked. bye."
1,PUT IT ON PS2!!!,i want to play the best video game ever made with better graphics and better gameplay but i have a ps2 AND I BOUGHT THE PS2 BECAUSE I WAS SURE THAT ALL THE NEW METAL GEAR GAMES WOULD COME OUT ON THAT SYSTEM!! i dont want to have to buy a gamecube just so i can play one game [...]
3,Oh Why?,"I bought this game because I had read many favorable reviews, but I made one mistake. I ignored those reviewers who had some critisms. I realised that majority doesn't always rule. I will admit that I have never played any other Metal Gear game before, but I love sneaking, spying type games (loved Splinter Cell). So I bought this game expecting something similar. Boy was I disappointed. First the game is short. Over half of it is cutscenes. Lots of long and drawn out dialog. I also got a feeling that through the dialog the creators were trying to preach to me some political agenda. Which I hate! The controls were very awkward. Which makes the game difficult. I also found the story a bit ridiculous and some of the characters were quite annoying. Overall I felt like I was jipped by this game. You spend lots of money for games these days. If I wanted a movie I would have bought myself a good dvd to watch. Unless you are a huge fan of the orignal, I'd say skip it!"
4,A remake of the playstation classic,"I give this game 4/5 stars because its just a remake of the mgs for the psone. It will have a few added features like, better graphics and an all new first person mode but nothing much else. If you owned the first one then you might want to rent this one. But, if you never had an opportunity to play the original than get this one."
3,Major Disappointment,"I got this game as a gift, so that eases the frustration, and I started playing it, unfortunately after finishing the original Splinter Cell, so I was expecting something similar, and also I was expecting something else due to the fact I have read great reviews abut this game.The most frustrating thing us that you get a fixed camera angle, sometimes you get lost in what you are supposed to do, in boss fights if you don't read game guides there is no clue of what to do.What I have enjoyed are the cutscenes and the audio, but the gameplay I guess you can only like it if you are a fan of the series and hadn't played before Splinter Cell."
4,Great game......Hey TO THE GUY WHO SAID ITS STUPID,Hey if you think the game is stupid why the hell are you reviewing it. This game is awesome! You dont know crap about video games. AND WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU GO TO BEST BUY JUST TO SEE IF THE GAMES WERE SOLD OUT????! If youre trying to prove a point than you suck at it. Maybe if you wanted to get something thats alright but just to check if they were sold out is just plain stupid. Like you.........So why dont you go check your self stop making a stupid point.This game is off the hook even though they didnt add anything new.
5,On My Way to You by Judi Connelli,An extraordinary talent. The rest of the world has to catch up to Australia and discover this wonderful sound for themselves.
3,OK,"I bought this camera as a beginer, and it was a bit to much advanced. It does have some very handy features, like 3 flash modes, but it is much to complexed for beginers. For advanced people, it doesnt have all the bells and whistles you would want (my neighbour, who is crazy about photography said that)"
5,One of My Favorite Game Gear Games,"Sonic Chaos is one of the best game gear games, so if you have a Game Gear, I highly recommend it. It's great that Sega also kept it 2D, unlike it's poor attempt at 3D in Sonic Blast. Tails is also playable, and he can fly, which is awesome, because Sonic Team rarely makes Tails playable anymore. I'm a hardcore video gamer, and I've played a lot of video games that are kind of recent, but I suggest you keep it classic until the new Mario, Lego, Metroid, and that cool Cars game comes out. Maybe I'll try Sega Racing (I don't know if I can trust Sonic Team games anymore), but, for now, stick to the old school games. I highly recommend it, and this is coming from a big Sonic fan. Get Sonic Chaos for your GG, and it'll be one of those games that you just can't regret."
2,not exactly buttery,"Love the idea of a low calorie popcorn as a snack while on a diet. But this one is pretty flavourless. It is a wise decision from a healthy point of view, but beware the lack of flavour."
3,3 Points?,Convenient and relatively tasty for microwave popcorn. But is it really 3 Points per bag or is it 3 points per serving and there is 2 1/2 servings per bag making it more like 8 Points per bag???!!!
1,non-pop corn,"I bought a 10-pack box of this from the local grocery store and after trying 2 bags, I am throwing the rest out. The problem is that most of the kernels don't pop. Of the few kernels that do pop, the flavor is ok, but there are soooooo few of them compared to the hundred or more unpopped kernels. (My microwave works fine for other brands.)"
4,What do I think about this grate book,"This book is about the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In this book it says that the Germans told the Japanese that they would declare war on America if Japan attacked first!This book is a little hard to read because of all the different names.I gave this book four out of five stars because it is full of facts and a great read, it is also full of great information. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about this significant event."
3,my book,"My book, Air raid Pearl Harbor,was a mixture of good and bad parts.First I found out that the war was unexpected to the Americans.On december 7th the japanese attacked our air base on Oahu.they sank many of our ships and airplanes.i felt that the begining ofthe book was not very exciting because the author madethe book toocomplicated and diffcult to understand.The action got a lot better and the got more exciting.The Americans entered the war and ships were sinking and planes were being blown up.Iwould recommend this book to somone who is interested in complicated books."
4,Pearl Harbor,"I found this book really interesting, its like little stories in the one book. It also puts u in perspectives of the people in the book, which was sorta cool, but all the same concept of course. I would recommend this book to 7th and 8th graders."
4,my review,"my favorit part is when the whole world found out that prarl harbor had been deyastated in a japanese air raid. they thought nothing could hurt this deck until japs. came along. Although the wuited states prossessed to advanced on technolgy such as rador and purple . a top scertecode braker, the information gathered was often discered of misclassified. but once the raid was luanched , bravery abounded- on booth sides."
1,deth tolls on ye strange travelor,"this book is inbetween action and history and by that i mean that 6 out of 8 chapters involve no action whatsoever besides i little thing on spys while the 7 chapter involved the bombing and the 8th involved whom died and who was a hero if i had wonted to learn about the purple machine then i wouldve gone to a museum and learned about it instead of learning what they said before the attack which is totaly useless and it does inolve if not racial hatred itself it still ""forgot"" to tell of dead japanese and the japanese hero born that day anyway read this book if you wish to read a poorly substituted substitue for action or your moms forcing you too"
4,Serious Scooby fan,Who can pass up Scooby Doo? Have been a fan for years and enjoy watching Scooby Doo with our grandchildren!
3,"Fun, but not like the classic cartoon","I originally bought these for my 3-yr old nephew but he's not quite ready for the Zombie Island movie, but found the Aliens to be funny. The cartoons were both okay, but not as good as the original cartoon series. I personally liked the Zombie movie better than the Aliens."
2,pathetic copy,"The new CD of Jarabe de Palo is great. A new refreshing style that reminds me the 80s Madrid pop-rock, with influences from Los Ronaldos. The sound quality is good but after a few minutes of the end of the last song, a ranchera sounds! It seems this CD has been recorded on top of an older CD...unacceptable. Also the title is wrong! Let's copy it right: AdelantAndo. I will never buy a CD from Warner latino again."
3,It was okay...,"I recently purchased this CD for myself. The background music is pretty similar to the original songs. However, the backing vocals were not as great as I expected. Overall, it was pretty average. I would still recommend it, though."
3,Nice socks but not worth the cost.,Purchased these socks for my husband that is on his feet all day. I thougth they would have extra cushioning on the bottom. They are well constructed but basically just like any ordinary tube sock. I don't see them holding up any longer than normal and my husband does not feel any difference in them. For the same results and to save money might as well buy the tube socks that the chain stores carry.
2,"although it installed easily the range of sound on this speaker is sub-par,","I did replace a sony woofer so i should not expected the same quality and did not. Although it was a quick install the dynamic range of this pyramid speaker is lacking severely . the old saying you get what you pay for applies in this case, cheap speaker=cheap sound"
3,Lighter than I thought,"These speakers were ok, but had a very small magnet, They still fit good in my old cabinet,that i needed to repalce old speakers, I'm using them for surround speakers anyway."
4,Good sound Good value w/ measurements,"Like some others, I bought a pair of these to replace dry-rotted woofers in my old, but quality, home, floor speakers.When I went to install one of the 10"" Pyramids, I found out that all 10"" speakers aren't the same. These won't just screw into my speaker cabinets.It sounded pretty good when I held it in position against my speaker cabinet, so I made some adapters and installed them.Now my speakers sound good again.I'm an older gentleman that wants sound quality over loudness and 'rumbling', so 'sound good' is in that light.For the record, these are 10-1/8"" across. The mount holes are (about) 9-5/8"" across. The cut-out dimension is 9"".BTW; I went online and looked at the specs of multiple 10 and 12"" speakers and found the dimensions of speakers varies greatly, so it's not anything against Pyramid."
4,An excellent value if you need mid-bass replacements,"I was surprised at the quality of this low-priced woofer, even before breaking them in. I added a pair of them in a customized home theater speaker. They handle the mid-bass (down to the THX 80Hz cutoff) between an Altec horn and a 15-inch subwoofer, and they're surprisingly tight and punchy. They are dynamic enough to handle reference-level volumes, although I suspect they would have noticeable limitations if applied for full-range bass reproduction in a bookshelf speaker enclosure."
2,Excellent Cast in a Horrible Production,"Do yourself a favor skip this current DVD offering and get the excellent ARTHAUS MUSIC DVD with Gottlob Frick, Arlene Saunders and an excellent cast in a great traditional (in the best sense of the word) production."
4,A great bobble head! (Never thought I'd say that sentence.),"In general, I am not a huge fan of bobble heads; however, I was pretty smitten with the Batgirl bobble head when I saw her on the shelf at a local boutique. The sculpt of the figurine is wonderful, as is the paint aplication.The only thing that is sort of weird is that the inside of Batgirl's cape is painted yellow; this is odd because the rest of the figurine is based on the comic-book version of the character, which has a solid blue/black cape. Aside from this one thing, this is a great figure. The cape flexes slightly, so it won't easily break. A fun item for Batgirl fans and bobble head collectors!!"
3,"Ok, not great...","Ok, not great. I ended up buying the Lonely Planet phrasebook once I was already in China and found it more useful and better organized. While there's lots of useful information in Speak E-Z Chinese, it's not well organized (at least to me) and its medium text-book size makes it less practical to carry it around if you don't want to carry a bag compared with the pocket-sized phrasebooks. I dumped this book at the hotel and carried the Lonely Planet phrasebook in my back pocket or jacket pocket. However, others may find it more useful depending on their needs."
4,Works Well Easy to Understand,I have found it to be useful. I am using it to supplement my other language learning resources. Looking up words is quick and easy. The phonetic spelling works well. The pronunciations must be the official language dialect. My wife is Chinese and her version of words pronunciation differs slightly but she is able to understand my attempts.I wish it had more words. But you can't have everything. Good Book!
5,Fantastic!,"I've been in China for 3 years now and this book was my lifesaver. I bought quite a few books and software/audio before coming to China and have tried many things here, but this is by far the very best AND the price is much better than say Rosetta Stone!What makes this book great, is it covers many words used in daily life/slang, not just textbook words. And it is so easy with the English phonetics of each word. Anyone who is considering learning Mandarin, needs to realize that tones are the key part of the language and this book helps you say it correctly.I have also bought their little helper cards and downloaded their audio recordings as well.I am a BIG fan of this and you will like it a lot."
5,Mandarin can be fun,"This is great book. My husband and I are going to China and we want to learn some Mandarin. We hired an instructor from Inlingua. After we showed her this book, she decided to use it for our lessons instead of tradiional materials. We really liked the computer access."
3,"Eh, same complaints","I bought this book knowing the complaints about it. They're all accurate but it doesn't mean this book is useless. It is great for introducing one to slang and uncommon yet useful mandarin, which courses would not necessarily expose one to. Good for the intermediate or novice mandarin learner."

5,"Finally, Disneyland USA","Finally 'Disneyland USA' makes it to DVD. And worth the wait. This is a beautiful print in full wide-screen Cinemascope. Other early footage of Disneyland under construction (IN COLOR) is included in this set as well. Tony Baxter's commentary is great. There are other things on the disks, but if you're a fan of Disneyland, just these two items make it a must-have."
5,Love it,"I love this Walt Disney Treasures Disneyland. My mom was so thrilled to see the old rides that she remembers, everytime I looked over she was smilling. The DVD's are so wonderful and I know I will be watching it over and over again. This dvd is a must buy for any Disney Fan or anybody that is just looking to get a smile on there face."
5,The Secrets of Jonathan Sperry,This is a great teaching tool along with the entertainment for young youth group ministries.Takes on situations that young boys learn growing through the word of God.Great Movie
5,Teh secrets of Johathan Sperry,Item shipped fast and item was just as described. This is a very good movie. We enjoyed it so much.
5,Secrets of Johathan Sperry,"I bought this children's DVD for my grandson who has a problem at school with bullies. This story is about a 12-year old boy who cuts grass for Jonathan Sperry. The boy shared his concern about a bully at school. Jonathan Sperry helped the boy understand why that boy is a bully and how to handle the situation in a Biblical manner. Jonathan Sperry paid the grass cutter to mow his neighbor's yard who turned out to be the man, drinking and driving, killed his beloved wife. Near the end, the grass cutter, his two friends, the bully and his two friends become Christians and share Bible Study together. When Jonathan Sperry died suddenly, the grass cutter started holding home bible studies for his friends. The man who killed Sperry's wife started reading the Bible. All the children grew up to serve God in different ways. It is also a story of forgiveness."
5,Good Family movoe,"I liked this movie. It is a bit odd, but who wants to see the same thing over and over. In real life, boys do not change their entire personalities over night, but I thought the movie had a good message. I did not understand why the boys were not baptized for the remission of sins until I saw the extras, which explains it was created by Pentecostals. I am going to show this movie to my grandchildren. After, we will have a Bible study to let them pick out the good parts of the movie and those that are not biblical. I would recommend this movie."
3,Title,"Not as exciting a movie as I had hoped. However, I received it promptly and without any problems."
5,Great for the Whole Family!,A great movie to teach powerful lessons to your children (and yourself!). Make sure to have a family discussion afterwards and discuss the lessons learned to reinforce them!
5,Amazing,"This record is one of the best country albums to come out in the last 5 years. I am very impressed, although what should I expect from Alan Jackson's nephew. I am also amazed at the guitar talents of Adam on the record. Its good to see a young guy playing Gretsch. I can't say too much though because I am kind of biased because my brother is on the road with them right now as their pedal steel guitar player (he didn't play on the record, but he's on the road). But yeah, its a great record if you are looking for some laid-back, real country music, non of that pop crap!"
5,Super duo!!,"This is a really refreshing CD to listen to. Very nice harmonies and lyrics. There's been entirely too much junk coming out of Nashville in recent years. Seems like they're more interested in selling sex than music. If it gets any trashier, they might change the name from Nashville to ""Trashville"". My only suggestion for improvement here would be to add some fiddle to some tracks. A fiddle would fit right in. Try this one, you'll like it!!!"
5,On the Wright road,"I knew about this cd but I did not plan to buy it, but on 7/7/06 I went to the Rhonda Vincent concert in Newnan, GA. The Wrights were the opening act. Two guitars, two voices, and I was sold on them. I had to get their cd. Here is the thing, these two can write great songs. If you like the songs of Guy Clark, Rodney Crowell, Buddy and Julie Miller then you should like The Wrights. They have a bit of an alt-country sound and that is the type of country music that I love. I wish them the best."
4,Who would have known...,"As a backdrop to the entire history of the already world reknown Castlevannia series, this game lives up to its predecessors. Only lacking in game length and depth of the story, the game mechanics are challenging at first, but after a short adjustment time, it can be easily mastered. While lacking in length, the difficulty of the game is one of its strong points since it escalates while you advance in the game, offering the player a variety of options with regards to the approach of the same.Overall, this game is a must for Castlevania fans everywhere in order to read about the humble beginnings of the Belmont Clan, and most of all, brush up a bit on Castlevania Vampire lore."
4,Very good storyline.,"I truly did enjoy this videogame. This is my first Castlevania game, after spending almost my whole life hearing about how incredible the series was. I was not dissapointed. But the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found the gameplay to be a bit repetative."
4,Great monsters,"There were quite a few things about this game I enjoyed. The story line was excellent. It started off typical(guy says girl from X)but takes a dramatic twist when you have to kill the girl you saved. That is sweeeet. There is an abundancy of different monsters and the bosses are well done. I thought they could have did a little more with Death, but the creature in the prison of eternal torment was amazing....A THREE LEVEL BOSS! Wowzers. I thought a lot of the whips were a little to difficult to find and I completely hated how you had no control over the camera angle. All in all this game was a little bit short, but I thought it was a real keeper."
2,Not a fan of this game,"It lacks camera controls, which I simply do not like in a game.I put this game down after just a couple hours...seems to be a pure beat 'em up, which is not my personal cup of tea."
4,Good,"Castlevania: Lament of Innocence is a good game, the gameplay is good, the graphics are good and detailed. The mood, feel, and just overall atmosphere for the game are great. And the music is that awesome Castlevania-style music everyone (or, I think everyone?) loves (or should love). It's a bit short, and exploration isn't as strong as other Castlevania's, but that doesn't affect the fun-factor too much, it's still a good and fun game that I definitely recommend. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
4,Not bad for a 3d game,"Lament is a fun, though fairly short and simple, game that marks a promising new beginning for this beloved series since N64."
2,Nah don't bother.,I played this game and it made absolutely no sense - maybe if it was Yaoi or something it'd make it worth playing. But I recommended Devil May Cry 3 anyday.
4,Trevor is back!,"I have played and mastered Castlevania when it first came on the game scene with Nintendo (actually i still have the game and my old N system). It's a great play for those who like adventure games with a twist and judging from what I've seen , it's going to hold up to all expectations. I'm looking forward to owning my own. One thing though, this game should have been released much earlier. What took you so long guys?"
4,Best Castlvania of Recent yrs.,"All in all, this was a great game. the graphics are appealing to the eye, lots of secrets to accomplish in order to get 100%, and items tie well together. My only complaints would be how you must use items during actual gameplay, when fighting a boss (such as the final hidden one) it becomes a chore to find a safe spot to scroll and select your item,completing some of the puzzles can cause repeated swearing,MOST BOSSES ARE WAY TO EASY, and backtracking can be annoying. Other than these, i enjoyed the game very much so and beating some of the ladder enemies does give you a sense of accomplishment. Just hope the next installment on PS2 is more challenging."
4,Awsome,"Woot Konami! Lament of Innocence rocks!However, it's not perfect for instance, lose the real-time item selection, i mean, come on I hate a really easy game, such as Devil May Cry, but i found it a bit difficult to use items in battle and not die. I don't like that. And i have a really old tv, that has a bad picture, and i couldn't read the gothic writing, such as the names of the 5 parts of the castel.Other than that, i didn't have much of a problem.I loved the sub weapons, the A/V, and the enemies were neat(except for Red Skeletons, grrr).Over all, it's a great game, although i wouldn't recomend it to a beginer, it's pretty challenging."
5,I loved it,If someone gave this game a poor review don't listen to them. This game is so cool. The bad guys that you fight are awesome with brilliant textures. Some parts of this game make it look teen. But as you adventure on through the amazing 3D levels you will find it gets quite red and bloody. Leon is really cool. As Leon Belmont you can use your whip or your knives. Also their are a lot of moves you can do with each of them. I strongly recommend this game espically if you can find it for 40.00
3,Decent old school feel,"The title of my review basically said it all. No complex controls, no spectacular controls and or odd camera angles. This is your basic hack and slash run through game. Even though it's not all bad it's not all great. When this came out I really looked foward to it because I played most if not all the other Castlevania games for the older systems back during the day and I thought it would be cool to see this title in a more modern way. Don't get me wrong, this is a little more modern but no where near what I thought it would be. This is a game worth having/ and or renting if old school is your style."
3,Could have been a lot worse...,"... but by removing the exploration and RPG aspects of the previous 4 games in the series, they removed most of the compelling aspects since Symphony of the Night. The whip-action translates well into 3D, the graphics are great, and the music is adequate; but for a game set at the start of such an epic story, we could do with a bit more than a quick intro and a dull outro for story. It's good enough to finish, but not something you'd want to purchase more than a lot of other games. Rent it."
3,"Decent ,but cannot compare to Symphony of the night","I have been really looking forward to this game for a long time.Honestly I am a bit let down. Symphony of the night was without a doubt the BEST Castlevania game ever, this game was made by te same people that made SOTN, but yet it isn't even close.While it is probably worth owning, it cant hold a candle next to SOTN. I am starting to think that Castlevania may not be possible to make into a 3d game that is as good as the 2d ones.they should have made a sequel to SOTN and made it 2d.THis is the kind of game where you HAVE to have a strategy guide or you get nowhere.COME ON!!! thats never any fun!rent before you buy."
4,castlevania,"you can tell its a konami game because of all the camera angels.it is still very fun,but also very complicated thats why you need the stratagy guide."
2,A Disappointment,"Many of the video game magazines are of the opinion that this is the first 3D Castlevania game to be worthy of the name. It is better than that joke on the Nintendo 64, but that's not saying much.The action is tedious and repetitive, and the levels are way too simple for their size. You'll spend a lot of time just walking all over the place to hit switches. BOOORING! To make things worse, most of the rooms are nearly identical. While playing this game, I felt like a rat, running through a maze, looking for my piece of cheese. The music is weak too, and I was really expecting better in this department since the music for Super Castlevania 4, Bloodlines, Dracula X, and Symphony of the Night was first class!If this kind of game interests you, I'd suggest 'Devil May Cry' or 'Metroid Prime.'They're actually good!"
3,Common Sense,"An interesting book with quick and easy to read chapters that are very well written. The book does, however, read like it is written for high school students or at most college freshman. It is a bit too easy to understand and states the really obvious a bit too much so it isn't a good book for 2nd year college students or above. It might be good for liesure but I doubt you'd walk away having learned anything new."
1,very disappointed,This order came with one one juggling ring - which I did not think was clear from the picture. when I complained that it spent $5 on one ring and $5 to ship it - the company indicated that it was clear in the add that only one was included.
1,Complain,They didn't send me the right item plus it wasn't the right size either so I can't rate this with five stars sorry!!!!!!
2,VERY CHEAP SHIRT - Nice design but cheap,The shirt is very cheap. So thin you can see through it. The 'first to fight' is so light you can barely read it. I bought this because of the design and somewhat for the good reviews but the quality is poor. It may fall apart completely after washing.They had a good logo but the shirt itself is very very cheap. I'm not sure what will be left after washing.
1,Poor Quality,"I was SO disappointed in this shirt. I ordered a medium, which looked like a small when I received it. You can see straight thru the material it is so thin. It was a Christmas gift for my FIL who is a Vietnam veteran and I had no choice but to give it to him because there was no time to return it. I pray it retains its color when washed and doesn't shrink. I did contact the seller to let them know I was unsatisfied but all they did was offer to have me return it. I have to say, they did contact me within a few days of me emailing them so they were prompt. Still, I won't reorder again. :("
4,"Well, It's OK","I really wanted to love this cookbook. But I don't. I like it just fine, but it didn't make me as happy as I thought it would. Why so many recipes with turkey? Am I so far outside the norm that I don't have 3 cups cooked turkey lying around all the time, and everyone else does? I know that I could subsitiute chicken, but that's not the point. Not a bad cookbook, by any means, I just don't love it as much as I thought I would. I like the little ... cookbooks that you get in the checkout lane at the grocery just as much, and those aren't as much of an investment."
3,"Ok, nothing special","I bought this book because I was searching for recipes which I can prepare in advance and leave for my family when I'm away. I have tried a few of the recipes (Bacon Cheeseburger Upside Down Pizza, Baked Ravioli with Meatballs, and a few others)and they have all been good. In other words, my family and I were never displeased with any of the recipes, but they were never excited about any of them either. But we are used to more flavorful dishes since I cook mostly Vietnamese and Mexican dishes. The recipes are really easy to follow though and the pictures are wonderful (most of which looked better than they taste). Overall, the book is great, the recipes are so-so. The dishes in here don't really excite the taste buds, but I'm sure with some experimentation and imagination, anyone can customize them and ""kick them up a few notches."""
2,ARCHIVAL PRODUCTION,This was a good dvd if you really wanted to see the Julie Andrews production. Not so great if you wanted high quality viewing as this is a old taping and the technology wasnt invented yet. SO its kinda shadowy sometimes and dark and not high quality production values. It fit my purposes fine as I was researching different productions of Cinderella.
3,cinderella,I was disappointed in this movie.I know it is because it is not the movie I thought I was getting.The movie I wanted was in black and white and I saw it as a child.I thought this was the same one and it was done in color.It is a good movie if you like that kind.I just wish I had made sure it was what I wanted.
1,Deceiving Cover,"I didn't read the fine print or I wouldn't have bought this low quality, grainy black & white TV version of Cinderella. Julie Andrews sings beautifully but the camera angles are HORRIBLE and whoever filmed this didn't have the skill or talent for film making.Only old TV buffs will like this . I didn't get past the first ten minutes.Waste of money."
4,The Julie Andrews original,"The problems with the picture are familiar to other aficianados of old television productions and no fault of its sellers, and the sound quality is amazing and wonderful. A good way to get our ""fix"" of a young Julie Andrews."
4,Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (1957 Version),I Didn't know that this Cinderella existed. It is not as good as some but is close to the Lesley Ann Warren version. Julie Andrews of course could play any part and make the charactor her own. I really like that Julie Andrews introduced the movie in the beginning and gave us some history about it.
5,Vital Piece of History & Great DVD,"This DVD captures a vital piece of history. Originally broadcast live in 1957, technology was finally developed to create the DVD from the original kinescope recording--a predecessor to VHS. The original live CBS production was seen by more than 60% of the American population. There is an absolutely stellar cast with phenomenal performaces made even more amazing when you realize there were no breaks, no pauses, no re-takes, and no edits. What you see was what was happening live in the studio and what was broadcast live across North America. WOW! Bravo to the original company and Bravo to the Rodgers and Hammerstein origanization for making this available to the world."
4,Fantastic rendition!,"We have seen this play several times in different areas of the country, and this original version is truly fantastic. The songs are perfectly keyed for Julie Andrews. I agree with the previous reviews about the her wonderful performance. Not to be overlooked is Jon Cypher's performance as Prince Christopher. Although he looked a bit older than the role's intent of 21, he gazed at Cinderella (Julie Andrews) with such devotion during the dance scenes it really made you feel like he was in love. Just enchanting!The viewer must keep in mind that this was filmed in black and white from a live performance in 1957, so do not expect 2011 technical quality filming or effects. If you appreciate theatre and old movies, then you will enjoy this original rendition."
2,Lovely music but terrible video quality,"I was really looking forward to viewing this video, but the film quality of it is miserable. It is not a restored video and looks worse that I imagine it was when it first aired on television; terribly grainy and out of focus. There is no voice quite like Julie Andrews' and that is the ONLY thing that carries this production. I did read some of the other reviews that weren't very complimentary, but I didn't think something with Julie Andrews in it could be that bad. I was wrong. The producers of this product really need to pull this DVD and restore the video before it's released again. It could be--no, SHOULD be wonderful, even in black and white."
1,Original TV movie of Cinderella,"I received this DVD as a gift and I was very disappointed. The ""film"" quality was so bad you could barely see the actors at times. It looked like a movie made sometime in the 1930's. The music was still great but I didn't get a music CD. I would never buy this product for anyone unless it was remastered. I plan to return it."
5,PERFECT,Used movie in great shape. Bought the movie for my mother and she was thrilled beyond belief. She is a big Cinderella fan.
2,Original Cinderella,"A bit disappointed - I had never seen this version before, having grown up watching the 60's version in color which I love, and even though Julie Andrews is very good, the story line was somewhat different and I found I prefer the 60's version"
2,Horrible Video Quality,"Even for 1957 Television. Nothing to see here, I would recommend skipping the DVD and buying the CD soundtrack to get some decent audio. Julie Andrews is good but cannot save the poor quality of the production. By the way, would it have been possible to find actresses under the age of 50 to play Cinderella's sisters?"
3,Wish I would have rented it first,"Being an R & H movie I knew that it would be good, but having never seen it I wish I would have rented it first. The lines were odd. Julie Andrews voice though does make up for it. Glad that I have it, completes the colection of all the Cindrellas made."
3,Cinderella - Julia Andrews Version 1957,"Loved Julia Andrews! Loved the special feature about the making of the show! Loved seeing Rogers and Hammerstein on the Ed Sullivan Show! These guys are icons. It is amazing what was accomplished on live television.I find this to be a great historical record and and enjoyable performance. However, television and the staging of musicals has become more lavish and creative, so based on that criteria, my preference is the Brandy version. However, even Brandy does not hold a candle to Julie Andrews for being Cinderella! (And Leslie Anne Warren, 1965 version doesn't even come close!)"
3,cinderella,i never knew that julie andrews made cinderella. she did pretty good. the tape came quickly and in good shape. thanks
5,great,what a great movie i have not seen this for 45 years and truley enjoyed seeing again thanks so much
3,1950's style television performance of Cinderella starring Julie Andrews.,1957 Television Production of Cinderella starring Julie Andrews was entertaining as long as you realize that 1950's television was not like the sophisticated performances and techniques used Today. Julie Andrews took the part well and her voice was at its peak then. The play was a happy reminder of the era.
5,Black and White TV Musical Treasure from the 1950's,"I had never seen this musical as it was only broadcast the year I was born. We did enjoy Julie Andrews on a recording of My Fair Lady and later in her movies. So, it is amazing to see this DVD of her early efforts so many years later. The studio was small, but the staging makes use of it all. The small screen is filled with singing, dancing, and musical drama. It is not as refined as the 1964 remake with Lesley Ann Warren, or the later Disney version with Brandy Norwood which did show on our childhood TVs. But it captures a bright moment in the 1950's when TV was still a new and blooming medium for family enjoyment. (But it never explains how all those ladies managed that staircase in high heels!)"

Came with some screws, may need more depending on your application. Over all it looks good, and would get another if I need one."
5,"""The mother of all books on the Gulf War""","""[The Continuing Storm] is the mother of all books on the gulf war written by one of today's most brilliant political-military analysts, Avigdor Haselkorn...The author's extraordinary documentation--the encyclopedic footnotes alone are a sort of volume two--and reasoning must be attended two.""""'As long as we accept the arguments of Bush and his colleagues as they struggle to explain their stated reasons for ending the war,' writes Mr. Haselkorn,'it will be impossible not to conclude that the president was either dangerously out of touch with the events at the close of the war or was simply acting irrationally. It is far better to believe that he and his cohorts are simply less than truthful.'""Arnold Beichman in WASHINGTON TIMES, April 18, 1999"
5,great stroller,"I am a new grandmother that hadn't bought a stroller for 25 years. I found this one at a baby re-sale shop and couldn't be happier. I am surprised that it is considered an umbrella stroller. I took the 6 month old to a ball game and everything fit in the storage and the ""book bag"". I didn't have to carry the diaper bag.I am 5'9"" and I did kick the wheels a couple of times, but I adjusted.This is a good quality stroller that fits my needs well."
4,Great Stroller...except for the sun shade,"I agree that the sun shade is pretty useless. But overall, this is a great stroller. As long as you pay attention to what the features are when you purchase it you should not be suprised when there is no cup holder. My bottle of water fits great in the attached bag. I was looking for a stroller that was lightweight, compact, a good name and sturdy. If I wanted all the ""bulky"" features like a snack tray for the child, cup holders, and a larger basket, I would have purchased a large, bulky, heavy, inconvenient travel system. I would recommend this stroller to anyone who is looking for ""simple""."
3,"Not the best, but good enough","I bought this stroller to go along with the Britax car seat companion and because I thought the car seat would not attach to any other stroller. I bought both online and I feel that I should have gone in store to really check it out. A good tip to any other new Mom buying a stroller: test it first, so you really get a good feel for what your buying! It's very important, especially if a stroller is going to be a big part of you and your baby's everyday life.Some down points:1)the wheels are to close together and I constantly kick the back wheels when I'm walking.2)the arms are not adjustable, so if you and your husband are tall, you will be always leaning forward to reach and push it.3)it is not very light and easy to maneuver."
5,Power Metal As It Should Be,"This is power metal as it should be. Watching Kamelot rocking on stage is a much superior experience to listening to the CD. The filming was beautifully done, capturing the mood perfectly. There is a story line to the show and the band moves from song to song effortlessly, keeping the excitement up even in the slower numbers like 'Abandoned'. Kahn's duet with Simone Simons of Epica on 'The Haunting' is flawless. Simone has such a charismatic stage presence at times it seems she might very well upstage Kahn!Not since Queen's Live at Wembley had I enjoyed and rocked so much to a live concert. Kamelot prove that they are the masters of their trade and this concert might very well go down as one of the defining moments of their history.Get it and rock your way to a great time."
5,Gods of power metal...,"An amazing DVD, Very well put together,the artists themselves are very open, including a lot of information on their second disc. The concert itself brought back memories of my concert experience and it was an incredible thing to have on dvd. I've played this concert DVD more times than any of the movies I currently own and am in love with the singers amazing high pitched opera style voice.A powerful band, and an amazing disc. Very good stuff and lots of fun."
5,Kamelot in Concert,Love to see truly talented bands in concert. I wish more of the progressive heavy metal bands would tour in my city of Dallas. Kamelot represents metal for fans who love the old progressive metal with todays technology. Really makes you wish kids would see the light and embrace rock and metal over hip hop.
2,VERY expensive for what it is....,"While the food is 100% organic, it contains quite a lot of inexpensive and not very nutritious grains. Better than the purportedly organic food that gets its protein from non-organic chicken meal, but not the perfect food. Six fishes by Orijen is a better food in my opinion - clean wild caught fish and grain free."
4,Love Awoh,I found myself dancing to the music from this CD. I was cleaning my apt. and it made this chore fun.Great harmonies and love the Marley remakes and the mix of hiphop and reggae. Looking forward to the next one.
3,A fun album,"These are bouncy tunes that capture some of the humor vintage roaring twenties that is presented with cleverness and love for the genre. Try not to smile when you hear the comb solos on Beedle Um Bum. Nice to hear Maria Muldaur singing on some of these songs, ""I'm a Woman"" is one of my favorites from this CD. Worthwhile."
4,old memories,"I had this album over 30 years ago. it was fun to sing along with. the fact that these arttists are actually playing the jug and washboard, kazoo etc. makes it well worth listening to. its a nice addition to anyones music library."
5,Love these!,"Bought these because too many of us gals are having to live with this illness. I am giving them out to my friends as one way to show our support. But remember, your car needs to have an antenna to put the ribbon on."
5,Highly recommend!!,Tyler P. has incorporated lots of laughs with some very talentedentertainers. Very funny you must see this one!
5,Great Play and Movie!-,"I saw the play a few years ago and I thought it was wonderful. I have seen all of Madea's plays and Tyler Perry did very well in this one. I would advise anyone who loves great entertainment to get the play.I watched the movie this weekend and it's wonderful. It's a little different from the play, but it is still wonderful. It will make you laugh, cry, get angry and happy. That's a great movie.It's a must buy and 'go see'."
2,Measure closely,The width of this item is about 1 1/2 inches too short for my grill. Measure closely with exsisting grids and do not assume it is close enough to work. Length is OK.
2,Boring and directionless,"I'm always looking for new, interesting, and EXCITING music and not afraid to try something new. I favor all kinds of jazz and rock, and after stumbling upon this CD and the reviews, I wanted to give it a try. It was rather boring and had no real direction. The worst selection being ""For You"" with the ridiculus words that are sporadically spoken. Obviously, the two individuals who gave this recording 5-Star reviews must be related to be band members or were paid to give a good review. Most likely this CD will go unlistened to for a very long time."
3,"not the best, but worth spending some time for it","Awful AI, save and load problems, game interface is sometimes useless. I had expected much better from a Masquerade adaptation. The only positives are graphics and sounds, but not enough to save a boring game. Keep playing the pen and paper, and unless you are a world of darkness fanatic, spend your money for a better game!"
4,a vampire's tale,"this game is pretty good. it isn't exactly the best but then again no games are. as an RPG, this game is fairly standard. the first hour or so is really boring, but once you become a vampire, things pick up rather nicely. i LOVE how you have vampiric abilities and are able to feed off whomever you see fit. this is the ultimate game for anyone who wants to live out their dream as a vampire. the story is good. the thing that i hate are the other characters in your team, maybe it's me, but the were annoying and got in the way. they didn't have terrible path finding, but they had some awkward moments. another thing that bothered me is that if you don't have control of A character, they usually go off attacking some monsters you might not be ready to attack, due to the nature of their vampiric ways or the character's build. overall, this game is fairly exciting, with something nice for lovers of RPGs and lovers of vampires."
3,A worthwhile game - almost...,"I would have gladly given this game 4 stars - without even trying the multiplayer side, which I hear is very awesome - if it wasn't for one great flaw. I was almost 6 hours into the game, kicking vampire booty and taking no prisoners. Then, something happened. With my usual grace I accidentally clicked on the ""New Game"" button at the menu screen. I thought it was little problem, and allowed it to accelerate me through the first few cinema scenes. I waited until it allowed me to control Christof, then I opened up the menu to escape and load my old game. Instead of seeing my old saved game, I saw ""Convent"". Well, needless to say I was very frustrated and angry, mostly at the absolutely thoughtless save-game feature. I still may try the single player game again, but not anytime in the near future."
4,Thoroughly enjoyed this game,"Although this game can get slow at times with some long winded diologue, I found this game to be right up my alley. If you love vampires in general, and appreciate some kickin graphics, this game is for you.I would not consider myself a gamer afficianado, however, I found the game easy to learn and found the fighting/story line combination to be a wonderful balance.All in all, the story line is really great, and the cliff-hanger ending has left me waiting for the next release. Enjoy!"
3,Vampire the masquerade,"I bought this game when it first came out and so I was happy to see it for so cheap on Amazon. The game was in great condition and I was able to play it on my Windows XP edition. Unfortunately my roommates got a new computer and it had Windows 7 which made the game obsolete. The graphics were a bit outdated, but it was just like I remembered."
2,Vampire: the masquerade redemption,"the story line is unchanging no matter what game chose you use, not worth the trouble."
3,"severly lacking, even considering its old age","this game is old, ill give it that, but its still no where near as entertaining as its followup game, bloodlines, which is actually very fun and has a decent replay factor. This game engine, along with dynamics and over all suckage makes for a waste of money. even for a walking down video game memory lane."
4,Vampire: The Masquerade-Redemption?,"This is an excellent RPG. I played it for over 10 hours non-stop! It isn't a simple or easy game to win, which makes it more interesting to play. (I don't know how many times I got beat on each level before figuring a stategy that worked, but it was a lot! But don't let this discourage you!) I just don't understand why it's called ""Redemption."" (I never became Human again.) Also there is an area I could not gain access to. There is a locked door called ""The Bowels of Vukodlock's Lair."" I could never figure out how to unlock this door. (Maybe that's why I was never redeemed.) Excellent Graphics, Action, Etc. A Very good game!"
3,Vampire Looks Great!,"I will admit that I bought the game because of screen shots, but I am an RPG fan albeit I play mostly AD&D. I have been reading a ton of vampire books and happend to see this so I rushed out after seeing the screenshots and purchased the game. The graphics are awesome and so is the scrolling but there are areas the game could be improved...Your characters seem to get in the way of each other, range weapons don't seem to 'snipe' from a distance, characters like to do their own things. That aside, I am finding the game rather enjoyable. If you like hack and slash type games this is for you. And keep the blood setting on! :)"
4,VTM - Redemption - Superior to Bloodlines,"Played both, as far as ""adult"" games go; Redemption is far superior for it's storyline, characters, and - despite being earlier in graphics development - it has much more interesting settings. As an addict to VTM games, I was very happy to see Bloodlines released; nonetheless, turning it into a clone of every other ""war game"", adding a few vulgar terms, then severely limiting character development and disciplines did not work. The ""godlike"" werewolf was not interesting for any vampire fan, and humans - even ghouls - running backwards in the dark, faster than any vampire can move, while firing weapons (And hitting the target) gets too silly. Flaws in middle english grammar, and the concept of ""average"" medieval europeans being able to read or write is not as silly as much that is in Bloodlines. As an adult game, both are too censored, but Bloodlines has no excuse."
4,vtm:r,well the game its self is good but oldthe gameplay is restricting wich gives it a chalange the ai is not very smart but it is old and over all its worth playing for the story line and multiple endings
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This has to be one of the biggest computer game dissapointments and waste of money ever. This game does not run - I tried to install it on three different machines, two of which had graphics cards which the game claims to support. Every time, the install routine crashes. I don't care how good the hype or the potential may be if you are one of those lucky ones who have managed to get this buggy disaster to run. I was so disgusted with the product that I sent an angry letter to Activision's CEO with the product."
4,Well done activision!,"Two years ago I read a computer magazine which contains vampire in reviews section.It was amazing i like the story i like the characthers especialy i like the four cities.Two of them in ancient times two of them in modern times.After two years Activision released the game and bought it.It was the same thing which i saw in the magazine.In the begining of the game (after you bit by woman) the enemies are strong i defeated them hardly then the boss of the first place came and i tried to defeat him sixteen times so it is a long and a hard game but the saving system of the game is worse but you can use your spells to save easier (except the clock level in viena you can't escape from there and you can't use your spells to escape so you can't save).I think activision made a great game about vampires the graphics are very good,the spells(disciplines)are very good...so, if you want to play a great and a long,hard game choose this one.(so so so so so....... :-P"
2,"save problems, but the not the norm","Apparently I'm the only one to have had this problem:After I saved, when I'd load the game, or when I'd start a new game, all the enemies I had killed up (as up to the farthest point I'd played to) were gone. Yes, even when I tried to start a new game, and watch all those freaking scenes again, the enemies would still be gone. Eventually I went into the file system and by deleting certain data files (the ones the system registered as updated at the time of my saving the game), I managed to make the enemies reappear. By that time, however, I was already way too annoyed to play it anymore. Then again, I seem to be the only person with this problem. Sigh."
2,"Ever taste cod oil? Like that, but fatal.","Boy, oh boy. I can remember the day that I waltzed into Software Etc. with hopes of buying a great game. What's this? White Wolf has made a game out of a paper and pencil RPG? Well that's great! It'll beat Baldur's Gate, hands down! So I bought it, along with Deus Ex (a great game, btw). Anyway, so I got home and played it for 3 hours.Hm... this kinda sucks. Well, I'm not even a vampire yet, it'll get better. Oh, was I wrong. It was even less fun when you have to worry about running out of blood. God, this game sucked so much, that I don't even want to finish this review.I'll just say this. A game that stops you from going somewhere by putting up an invisible wall is not worth buying. Way too linear. No freedom. Please don't buy this game, unless you're Richy Rich or something.PS: Buy Deus Ex instead!"
4,It captures gothic roleplaying very well.,"I found this game very worthly of the genre. The graphics are among the best, and it's not as gory as you are led to believe. The single person game is unique, and full of story plot. The various puzzles in the game are challenging but not overly difficult, and the creators did a good job in trying to bring the entire VAMPIRE game to the computer. It is a fun game. On the down side, you must go into a different area or find a certian scroll in order to save the game, which can be a problem and frustrating at times. I also wish that the game could have come with the ability to print out the characters you make in the multi-player games. All in all - Not bad."
4,RPG a major misnomer,"Heres the deal. People who liked the pen and paper version bought the game expecting an RPG but what they got was a clickfest akin to Diablo. This disapointed many hardcore RPGers but pleased those who like action games. If you want a good AD&D based RPG wait for BGII, pools of radiance, Icewind Dale, or better yet NeverWinterNights, for an action game which hasd very few RPG elements, buy The Masquerade."
5,school songs.,This was the perfect album. I needed it for a DVD we were making for my 50 year high school reunion and this album had it plus many other school songs on it. I was very happy it was available.
2,Authentic or Interpretative?,"If you're looking for something that you heard on those brisk fall Saturday's, this ISN'T the CD you want. It takes the well known melodies you loved and destroys their authentic sound. I have to admit it does some clever, interpretative stuff with the music, but ""clever"" wasn't what I was looking for. I gave it two stars because creativity must be rewarded even if it fails."
2,"Missing ""Hail State""","Misses probably the most rousing fight song in all of college sports, ""Hail State,"" the Mississippi State University fight song."
2,Pretty darn limited,"Has some good college songs on it but notably excluding the University of California that has a wealth of terrific songs:Sons of California Big C Stanford Jonahand many others. Pac Ten is underepresented - picking Ucla is silly. It only has one song, which is stole from the University of California!"
1,Yankee CD?,"Where's the SEC? No music from LSU (my school), Alabama (Yea, Alabama), or Tennessee (Rocky Top)? The only music you have that I recognize from a southern university is Tulane. They could've at least put in the FSU War Chant. If you're looking for Music from northern universities, enjoy this. If you're looking for the SEC (like I am), stay away!"
1,Left Out Cal!!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"Considering the fact that the University of California - Berkeley boasts the largest repetoire {sp?} of school songs of ANY university in the country makes the fact that this compilation has not included ANY of them problematic at the very least. Big C (or Sons of Westwood to you theiving baby bears out there) - Fight for California - Sons of California - Stanford Jonah - Golden Bear - Make Way for the Bear - Roll On - Cal Band March - California Triumph - Palms of Victory - California Indian Song - California Marching Song - One More River - All Hail - Hail to California - California, We're For You --Take your pick - they are all fantastic - and I think I forgot a few...To leave out Cal is either shoddy work or bad temperment.Go Bears - Beat the Cougars!"
1,Roooooooll Tide!,"This CD represents Michigan very well; it blows. There is a very noticeable geographic discrimination, i.e. no SEC at all???????? No Rocky Top or Yea, Alabama!:) Only CD like this to exclude either of those, let alone both! Sound isn't too bad though."
1,Dont Bother,"Nice idea to have 41 college fight songs. However, all done by U of M band, which seriously detracts from authentic flavor. Also, not done in fight song tempo, but in concert/orchestra structure...too slow and chorus-like. Need someone to put out each college band doing their own fight songs, and supply the lyrics! As a Buckeye, I didnt expect anything more from U of M. Dont waste your $$. GO BUCKS!"
4,"Good Selections, Well Played",This collection of college songs is large and includes more songs than other such collections. The songs are all well played and consistent with the style required for college fight songs.
3,They're Arrangements,"Nobody can fault the performance - Michigan (along with Illinois) has the best concert band around. But these are arrangements of the fight songs, not the original versions - at least for the Big 10. They won't do much for your next tailgate."
3,ok,"it was just sort of the usual- in my opinion. a new, mysterious dude comes to sweet valley and jessica pulls every trick in the book to get him. uh-huh. the book was all right but outrageous 2 me. liz was da only girl with da sense in dis story because she didn't fall under da guy's spell. SV will always be my favorite book series but they should kinda chill with da cursed/vampire/werewolf/magic stuff. just an opinion. i'm out."
4,Excellent addition to any dark world,"Mysterious Places is an excellent companion to Antagonists (1588464784) and Ghost Stories (1588464830), althoughy it's premade settings have more in common with the latter than the former.As part of the ""World of Darkness"" role-playing system, Mysterious Places provides a variety of backdrops (along with inspiration and a few monsters) for any mortal, Vampire, Werewolf or Mage chronicle. Storytellers playing ""mortal"" games might find this book most useful (unlike Antagonists, which has several entries with supernatural protagonists in mind), but with a few adaptions, any of these stories could be challenging and interesting for even the most jaded players.The only thing this books could use is a greater variety, and perhaps more for supernatural characters to interact with and challenge."
4,Little Disappointed.,"Just got the package from UPS today so I havent had a chance to actually use it. ARP makes great products though.I'm giving it a 4/5 stars because the picture is wrong. This is not for three bolts, it's for a single bolt that goes into the end of the cam shaft, mainly to hold on an eccentric if you're running a manual fuel pump."
3,Ahhh... confusing..,"I bought this game for my daughter last Christmas since she loves to dance. But I must say, I was dissapointed in the game because the directions were very broad. Now what I did not know was that you had to buy the mat which was not specified in ordering this product. Also, they price was a little high, and the music wasn't that great. My daughter enjoyed it, but I, as an adult, didn't think very much of it."
4,Dance like you've never danced before!!!!!,"This game has the BEST songs in the U.S. all packed into one Video-Game!The thing is , The difficulty is absolutly ridiculous!!I mean they might as well call ""Standard Mode"" Super Expert Mode!!!!!My favorite songs are:1.Let's Groove2.Twilight Zone3.AM-3PThis game is REALLY REALLY fun!!!You should definitly buy this game!!!It's also really good excirsise.Get the whole dance dance collection!!!!!! vote ""yes"" under this ok!!sincerly,kenny"
3,not what we thought,"My son wanted this game for a present and I read the reviews and chose this one. Now he got it with a pad and it is very difficult. The reviews did not help out that much. There are complicated arrows to follow and he just cannot move that fast. A week after getting it, he does not play with it.The customer reviews presented were not helpful and I based my purchase on them. Maybe he will revisit it but it takes a lot of coordination."
5,Great way to spend time with my teenage son,"This game is an awesome product. We have two dance pads at my house, so my teenage son and I can play together. I play on light mode, he plays on Heavy, and we have a great time together. The workout mode is excellent when playing by yourself for exercise. This is the only type of exercise that I can't wait to play!! Even when he is grounded from all other video games, he is allowed to play this one because he gets so much excercise from it. He loves the game as much as I do. One nit: cannot play two-player in exercise mode. Thus, you have an annoying end sequence to cycle through after every five games. Other than that, the game rocks. Highly recommended."
5,DDRMAX 2,DDRMAX 2 is hott.When i bought DDRMAX it was alright and i didnt have a lot of good and hard songs on it.But when i bought DDRMAX2 it actually gave me a challenge.I am really good at this game and its no lie.The hardest song i have ever did was probally AFROVANA and i got a B.So if u think your good at this game becuz u can do standard im sorry but trie to do that song and get a B
5,rockin!,"Great game, the best music of All the ddr series. I used to have this game but over time it scratched. Years later I find myself to miss this game. I just had to purchase again. Still fantastic!"
4,Its Ok.,Most of the songs you see listed are not the ones you get when you start the game. You have to play for hours non-end before you can start getting better songs.
5,Great Aerobic Game!,"I'm 34, overweight, and easily bored with exercise programs. I just hooked up DDR Max 2 and the dance mat that came with it, and so far, I love it! It's *quite* a workout, even on the beginner level (beginner means less intricate steps, *not* less intense workout).There's a workout mode, too, which you can set so that you're playing the game (hitting the right symbols at the right time) but the game doesn't end if you screw up too much. That's cool too.If I had young kids, I think I'd love this game as a tool for using up some of their energy. :-)If you buy this game, get the dance mat. (Toys R Us sells the mat and the game packaged together.) Using the hand-held controller for this game would be utterly lame."
4,Great DDR edition,"I've had a lot of fun with this one. Great music. The ""light"" mode has a few songs that I don't consider too ""light,"" and the setup can be a little annoying (specifically, turning characters on or off). Also, too many screens at the beginning and end (I don't need to see the credits every time I finish a game!). But you can stomp through them pretty quickly and get to the gameplay. If you find a similarly rated game for cheaper, buy it. I couldn't, so I got this one, and I'm pretty happy."
5,AMAZING FUN,"I recieved this game for Christmas with a Dance Pad. I must say it is the most addicting game I have ever played and an extremely fun form of working out! I just play till I can not stand anymore. I exercise and do not know it. I love DDR and you will too! Great music, fun courses, awesome time! Buy it, you will love it!"
1,YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!,"This is a disgrace. Whoever calls THIS a game, has problems. It's really cool! Ya get to ""dance"", or hit freakin' squares on a mat, while the worst techno music is being played in the backround to pornagraphic images. It is a disgrace to the dance culture! I have been taking street funk, hip-hop, world dance, and breakdancing for seven years, and I know dance. Overall, an annoying, expensive, retarted game that could be used for some other purpose. Just look at that cheesy cover! Dear GOD! Well, I'm rambling... just don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Much better than seditary gaming!,"I love this, I still don't understand how anyone can actually do the advanced levels (seems impossible to me). The thing that I'm not sure about is if it will save info for 2 players? Overall fun and a good workout for body and mind and spirit."
4,Da Best,It's the best it actolly has some real songs like dj sammy heaven and others and still have some old ones like groove and end of the centery BUY IT!! worth every penny... buy the konimai made mat it has slip profe on carpet and wood bottem you can tell where the buttons are and you wont fall on ur ass when u slip on the other ones
5,Awsome,I love this game!!! I got this game for christmas and before that I hade neva played ddr before. I like it because when I was a beginer they had a beginer mode which helped me get started. Has awsome songs!! One day me and my friend played for like 10 hours straight.lol. I would deffiently recomend this game!!!! A+
4,An entertaining introduction to some basic vocabulary,"""Inside, Outside, Upside Down,"" by Stan and Jan Berenstain, is one of the excellent ""Berenstain Bears"" series of children's books. This volume uses a very simple text and colorful illustrations to introduce some basic prepositions and adverbs to beginning readers.The simple plot follows the adventure of the Bear family's young boy cub, who ""stows away"" in a box and gets shipped to town. This is, however, one aspect of the book of which parents should be cautious. Enjoy the book with your children, but make sure they know not to climb into and hide in strange containers--such activity might be dangerous! The hero of our book, on the other hand, suffers no ill consequences from his actions.Overall, ""Inside, Outside..."" is not the best in the ""Bears"" series, but it is still an entertaining book with educational value. And the characteristic Berenstain artwork is always charming."
1,small book,attention to those ppl looking for a great deal.... please be mindful when ordering these that they are the very small board books... unfort i did not realize this when bought them.. very disapointed child on xmas.
2,Inside Outside Upside Down,"Inside Outside Upside Down was a very cute book. This story really has no moral; it's just a cute book to read. It talks about how the boy bear cub goes into a box and gets turned upside down on a truck and drives into town and comes back the very same way. I wouldn't recommend this book to any child if you are looking for something educational, it's just a fun book to read over and over again. But I would recommend it just for fun!"
4,Perfect for little hands,"I loved this book as a child and was excited to be able to buy it for my daughter in a size perfect for her little hands. Its a little less complicated than I remembered, but she loves to be able to sit with a book and turn the pages herself. She gravitates towards these smaller books, and will play with them frequently."
5,This book is awesome,this book is the bomb! i read it and it was a fun book to read and i got some laughs from it. Go buy and read this book for your kids!
5,Great Book,"My little boys love this book. It is a board book that is easy to read, and is entertaining. We take when we go to places. They love to turn the pages and look at the pictures. The board book also take a more wear-n-tear than a paperback. It is small enough to put in a small diaper bag, for those times when entertainment is needed."
3,Clock owner,"I purchased this clock few weeks ago. When it arrived it was packaged wonderfully. I assembled it and placed the battery in, the instructions were not clear on the pendulum part. The clock is lovely, a fine piece of art.but the plastic arm that holds the pendulum seems weak.My arm of the pendulum does not swing side to side when the clock is in motion.I complained to the seller and is having a hard time to return this clock."
3,Good camera but very basic,I got it for my son based primarily on price. I think a camera with an SD memory card woukd have made things much more convenient.
3,Web cam function?????,"Amazon's description says that the GS-80 has a web cam function -- but I just got mine today and after reading the manual I see that the instructions for using the camcorder as a web camera are for PV-GS85 ONLY! Am I missing something here, or is Amazon advertising some false information about this camera?"
3,Where's the Options,"OK, so first off, let me tell you why I bought this camera. I bought it to transfer miniDV to computer. Now it does that fine like every camera is suppose to. The problems are with the lack of options...- You have to unplug the battery to use the power adapter AC/DC Option- There is no mute option or audio routing, so when you play back tapes you have to listen to everything. You can't just hit play and let the computer digitize, you have to hear everything- There are no advanced options at all in the menu.It does what I need just very annoyingly..."
4,Nice little video camera,"I bought this for my parents, so that they would have something to record sailing trips and grandkids. They have only used it for one trip, but my dad is tickled with it. So far, so good."
2,Panasonic GS80: widescreen disappointing,"The wide screen playback was disappointing on the Panasonic PV-GS80 Mini DV Camcorder. The sides of the screen looked distorted. Other features worked well. Good zoom, but still returned unit."
1,Can't connect to your computer.,I purchased this camera yesterday and will be returning it tomorrow. The PV-GS85 will connect by USB cable but the PV-GS80 will not. I failed to check what I thought would be an obvious minimum feature. Shouldn't a digital camcorder connect to the computer for file transfer. An A/V cable was the only connectivity.This hot day after Thanksgiving score ended up being not so hot.
2,Doew not have any features,"The price is cheap but it is limited in what a person wants in a camera. Not light features, does not take still pictures, can't down load to a PC. This camera has limited features. Buy a digital camera that has the same features as most camcorder. Thats what I did and saved money plus have way more features than this camcorder did!!!!"
5,Easy to use,The camcorder was easy to use and seems to produce a good quality picture. This model does have have USB capability which means that transfering the videos to a computer is a more complex process. The camcorder is user friendly and easy to use.
2,Don't,"The Panasonic PV-GS80 is a good low end Camcorder, But it's big brother PV-GS85 is a much better buy. You can take pic's and save them on a SD card, It has more features than the 80. Don't buy the 80, buy the 85"
4,Pretty Much As Expected.,"The only issue is that the tab on the male ends are longer than they should be, but a quick trim job takes care of that and they are working well."
2,"When worked, it was nice","We had a very hard time finding DVD's that actually worked in this unit, but once we found the right brand/type, it recorded DVD's from VCR tapes very well."
2,"Do not buy this, it is a piece of garbage manufactured in China",It ran well as a VCR but we only recorded 6 disks and watched a few DVDs and it ceased to function.I popped the case open and all the vents for cooling are blocked by pieces of plastic or metal braces.The one inadequate cooling fan is isn't enough to suck the heat out of the device so it simply cooks itself to death after a few uses.I'm going to save up and buy a Sony Combo.
2,Easy to use but un-reliable,"Worked fine for 6 weeks then started having glitch problems on playback-exchanged it at Wal Mart for a 8320 model-timer is goofed up and tech support is of very little help. It seems like they know less than the consumer and very hard to understand during conversation. I really liked using the 8310 nd the 8320, they were a snap to use, gave sharp movies but all short lived."
1,RCA DRC8310N DVD Recorder / VCR Combo.,"It records but I cant get it to finalize the disk, lost over 10 blank DVSs to date, I Agree its crap."
1,Agree... junk.,"I bought this product brand new (not a refurbished model). Worked for about a year. Put in a DVD and it put up an error sign. Called the service, which said to unplug it and the computer would reset itself. NO such luck! VCR played a bit after the DVD, but error sign kept coming up, interface problem. Now it is completely dead, and I will open the case to hopefully dig out my VHS movie. At $149 dollars, not a good deal for only one year! If you buy this RCA, I strongly suggest getting it where you can purhase a powerful 3 year service warranty. For the one person who has gotten a good deal with this, it is the exception, and congratulations. I had mine about the same time, and out of the blue, kapoot!"
2,"Be afraid, very afraid-Never buy this product","Bought this at WalMart about 2 years ago. Started off ok, then the problems started. You never know when you are going to have a problem. The number 1 problem is finding a disk that will work. The stupid system must like the first disk it sees. Every time I try any other disk than the 1st one I used, I spend an hour or two trying to get the system started. Right now I am watching the stupid pile of junk going thru it's menus in slow motion. This started about 4 hours ago. Nothing is easy on this system. I should have taken it back after it stopped working after a few weeks. I got it going again and went thru a few more weeks and it all started again. I will find a new and better one somewhere and then watch this thing burn in a very hot fire in my back yard. I can't wait until then."
1,"turn , run , and dont look back !","This item is as they say "" if it looks to good to be true , odds are it aint !"" One word sums it up nicely ""JUNK "" Didnt work right from day 1 , shortly after the warrenty expired it died and I buried it i the bottom of the trash barrel ! Had to learn the hard way ! Its rated 1 star cause I couldnt put zero stars"
4,Garlic is very good for you,"This product is garlic in the form your body needs, and I digest it with no trouble. No garlic breath or anything like that."
2,Edited Lousy,"My advice to the publisher of ""Built Hard"" is to read a book with a title like ""Edited Right"". In at three instances, the descriptive text clearly doesn't match the exercise depicted. This is no minor shortcoming because even when there is no obvious descrepancy between text and photos, it leaves a virtual novice like myself wondering if the exercise is properly presented. The exercise presentations are medicore at best, even when there is no obvious discrepancy between text and photos. There are plenty of exercises depicted though, but a few are described only in a text and others with a only single photo. Though useful, the photos are on the dark side. One welcome bright spot is this: the book explains how exercises that are essentially similar differ in their effect on the same muscle or muscle group. Still this does not redeem this sloppy and disappointing book. There are much better choices."
4,Step by step,"This book is very good for beginner's I thought. I have just expressed an interest in weight lifting and training. I was very confused as what type of schedule to do and how to do it. I got this book, and I'm starting their requested routines. There are plans as to how to do it and what muscle group it works. The only negative aspect is that I don't have all the equipment it shows, so many excercises can not be achieved, unless at a gym."
2,2 STARS,"This book does show the proper form of exercises, but it lacks the emphasis on some of the exercises. The workout routines for beginners are way too advanced and will lead many people down the wrong path."
4,Beautiful Journey,This is a great example of what a good DJ is capable of. Takes you on a wonderful journey. Neil Lewis is a skilled artist and sensual master of the mix. Those of us who are lucky to catch him on the club scene know what I mean. Get this CD you won't be dissapointed.
1,"Poor design, made for tiny hands","Cons: Don't bother. The handle is a failure of design basics-- your knuckles will adjust the temperature knob while you are ironing (unless you have really really tiny hands). The steam blast does not work well (even waiting 30 seconds between blasts instead of the recommended 5 seconds), nor does the self clean button (which you have to hold down during the entire self clean cycle-- which is supposed to allow boiling water and steam to ""flow out of steam vents"". It doesn't). The Blast and Spray buttons are in the way of the handle, which requires a back grip behind the center of gravity, so your knuckles hit the buttons while holding the iron. The water fill door will not stay closed. More water dribbles from the lower vents of the iron when you stand it upright on the heel rest, than comes out during the cleaning cycle with a full tank. Maybe I got a defective iron.Pros: It looks sharp, and the semi-transparent base cover lets you see the water level. It irons."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"There is good music here, but the cd compiler failed to 'edit' the sound volumes from the sources. Upto about track 8 the volume is low, then for the rest of the cd (from later recordings), the volume is significantly higher.To make a consistently listenable compilation, some volume tweaking would have been desirable.The only other disappointment for me, is that one song I remember having on an LP didn't make this compilation. I think it contained the line ""the subway is not the underground"" but I can't remember the title."
5,Beautiful santa fe decor,I absolutley love kokopellis and this poster once framed has blended in beautifully with my santa fe decor.
5,Excellent value for the right item!,"These filters were the same as the original equipment - no cheapie replacements here! Sent quickly and packaged well, I was happy with the product and the company!"
3,"""Activision was in its prime in the PS1 era, and this one of many games that shows it.""","For an original PS game, this is challenging and you can tell effort was put into the making of this game. 'Activision' was in its prime in the PS1 days, and this one of many games that shows it. Even if platformers are not your type, this is a very good looking, fun game. It even comes with the original arcade 'Pitfall' and the main character is voiced by Bruce Campbell (which should be enough said). It has surprising graphics for the PS1 era, though the soundtrack is a bit repetitive at times. Works perfect on a PS2, haven't tried on a PS3.My only complaint is that my jewel case, when it arrived, had a giant sticker across it. I abhor stickers that block the view of cover art, and I do not understand why game stores do it.For a challenge, and for Bruce Campbell fans, this is a unique experience."
2,Not much to read or see here...,"This is a catalog of WSB's shotgun paintings and non-shotgun paintings, with Timothy Leary writing text. WSB wrights a small piece, and Tim Leary writes some essay about... well, his usual upbeat-but-not-quite-coherent stuff. It's rather bad writing, I have to say. Tim Leary was suffering Alzheimers, and this was probably written right before his death, so you shouldn't expect any master pieces, but even with that low expectation, it's still bad.The designer must have understood that, and tries to save the book by overdesigning Leary's text. A huge font here, totally covering the page, and then just some in the corner... Good try. However, you can't shake the impression that it's cheaply made.So if you are a huge fan of WSB or Leary or Weissman (you must be, if you are even READING this at all!), you might want to have it. But otherwise, no big deal."
2,waste of money,"This book is a review of articles, not useful to the common person at all. Unless you are doing a research paper, look elsewhere"
5,First cable without hum,"Usually bought cables in the $0.99 to $5 range, but always had hum problems when one end was unplugged. This cable is really beefy with solid connectors that look like they won't ever come loose from the wire. For me, a great investment. Only downside was that the blue is so dark that it looks black. Good cable!"
1,Keep looking...,"If you have a basic sense of rhythm, and the manual dexterity to open the box your congas came in - you've already surpassed the contents of this short instructional video.Rolando Soto may be a star on the stage, but he's ""dumbed it down"" too much for this video.After 30 minutes, you'll know without a doubt that you use a wrench to tune the drum - one lug at a time. You'll also discover that you can use one rhythm pattern for every song ever written...if you change the tempo.My advice? Skip it...unless you need a video cassette to record ""I Love Lucy"" on. You could probably learn more from Ricky Ricardo, anyway!"
3,Decent but not the best,"This text provides very terse definitions that may not be easily accessible to younger students (I purchased this for my niece in Middle School). There are no illustrations to clarify the definitions. This would make it even less suitable for younger (middle school) students. I would recommend the Harper-Collins Dictionary of Mathematics over this one for most people, especially middile and high school students. It includes illustrations, the definitions are more clearly written and it is thorough in its content."
3,A trashy novel from another era,"Don't buy this book expecting a fine and fancy piece of literature: that it ain't. Zhang Henshui was the Danielle Steel of early 20th century China, and this, one of his best known novels, has it all. Sex, suspense, intreague, betrayal...a page turner indeed.Shanghai Express is an enjoyable if not very edifying read. Like all trashy novels, its hard not to feel guilty for the expenditure of time and money, but its foreign-ness and time frame should assauge some misgivings.As 1930s pop literature, though, it does paint an interesting portrait of the manners and mores of its time. Ways of dressing, talking, eating, etc, present an unintentioned history.Be advised, though, the book has absolutely nothing to do with Shanghai. It is also unrelated to the American movie of the same title."
3,Runs small,I purchased the yellow. It is a pretty shoe but it runs small. Heel is two and a half inches high perfect for work. Order a half or full size up.
5,The Stones are still GREAT,Music to really take you back but also great for those who have never heard the Stones. They are still far better than anything today!
3,Few hidden gems here,"If you are a Stones fan (and if you're reading this then you probably are), you're probably familiar with all the hits on this CD (i.e., the songs that are on greatest hits compilations). You may be tempted to get the CD to hear some hidden gems -- songs that are good but that for some reason didn't become hits. Anyone doing that will, I think, be disappointed. The songs that did not become hits did not do so for a reason, and the reason is that they're really not that good.When they made ""Flowers"" the Stones had not yet reached their peak of the 1969-74 glory years. Prior to that, although they made some really good stuff, they also made some clunkers. This CD reflects that."
1,Not as advertised,"Flowers was advertised as a SACD hybrid, I received the remastered CD. This rating only reflects Amazons incorrect listing on the website."
1,Just Plain Rotten,"I was a big time Stones fan in the 60's. Just listened to the CD of Flowers and now I realize it stinks. We went from down and dirty, toe tapping stuff like Satisfaction, Can I Get A Witness, I Use TO Love Her and Little Red Rooster to such violen, over produced crap as My Girl, Sweet Lady Jane, Back Street girl. The Bee Gees sang better stuff.It was all for the money. Write your own songs and you do not have to share it with any one. Starting with Aftermath the Rolling Stones became the Mick and Kieth show with various back up. No wonder Brian went crazy. And they all knew it. The worse the songs got the more they depended on big stage productions with Mick wearing lipstick and jumping around like a frog. If anyone wants this CD and the LP let me know at Trishdubois@mac.com and it's yours. God help you."
2,It Stinks,"Yes, there are some good early Stones tunes here, but criminey...Sittin' On A Fence?? Ride On Baby??? My God, what awful drivel! I had a listen to this album last year, and had to take it back. If one takes it in its contextual framework, the we can recall how in-synch it was with the time in which it was created. But that's it, really, as the music is quite dated and it does sound like a garage band recorded it."
3,An incoherent Odds and Ends collection,"Okay, first a question. Why bother sticking both sides of the ""Let's Spend The Night Together"" single on two consecutive releases (""Between The Buttons"" being the other) when there was still some great b-side material left over from the mid sixties (See the ""Singles Collection: The London Years"")? This album was essentially a lame attempt by Abkco to make money off the Stones while waiting for their psychedelic Summer of Love statement ""Their Satanic Majesties Request"". Of interest to Stones enthusiasts repurchasing all the early albums: the version of ""Mother's Little Helper"" on this CD is a stereo mix while the one appearing on the UK ""Aftermath"" album is a mono mix. This is also the only place you'll find ""Ride On, Baby"", an above-average effort."
2,Unintelligible for the uninitiated,"I'm a student of contemporary art, and I consider myself educated and well read, but I find even this brief ""introduction"" to be chock full of the jargon and philosophical pretensions of a lot of high-level art criticism. Even though the author playfully tries to put these pretensions in their place, the book is still very dense and filled with the philosophical verbiage of the postmodern art criticism world.That being said, this book is a surprisingly comprehensive review of the philosophical underpinnings of the postmodern movement. But it's frustrating and dense, and if you're not already fascinated by this world, it will bore you to death."
2,It is what it says it is,"This book serves as a fairly straightforward introduction to postmodern thinking. Unfortunately, it is overly critical of postmodernism, which may discourage the curious beginner from pursuing the subject further. It might have been more appropriately titled, ""Postmodernism: A Very Short Critique"". While there is nothing inherently wrong with casting a critical eye on postmodernism, an introduction should be more balanced than this book is. I would recommend ""Teach Yourself Postmodernism by Glenn Ward as a better introduction."
2,disappointing read,"I've read the Very Short Introduction series on Poststructuralism and Art Theory, and they were excellent (I use them in my classes, because they're so clear and concise, beautifully outlined, and so well written, and I've recommended them to my students). I already know quite a lot about these subjects, but I learned a lot.So I was expecting a good solid work this time too, but it was pure negativity. He's hostile toward the subject, and the book reads like a harangue, or an editorial. It's just not a serious treatment of the subject."
3,The other version is better..,"Hope 7 seem like a cool band, but this song is EXACTLY the same as their other single ""I Want Everything"" on the Sleepover soundtrack. The lyrics are the only difference, and personally, I like the other one better. Listen for yourself and decide."
5,An Excellent Read,"I recommend this fantastic book to anyone intersted in Iceland. Forget the other guide books, none of them compare to this complete guideto Iceland."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"If there were zero stars, I would've used that. I read voraciously, mostly mysteries and science fiction, and read fast enough that it's hard to bore me into stopping before the end. I rarely fail to finish a book. But I didn't make it past page 20 in this one. Horrible writing, ludicrous plot, which would be fine as a parody if it was funny, but it's just stupid. If you visit the author's website (www.cliffordcroft.com), you'll see that he's written 17 books, not one of which he's ever managed to publish until he self-published this one. He offers all of his books as e-books for free, so if you really want to read this you can do so there without wasting your money on this book. However, if what I read was an example of the 17, I'd say at free they're horribly over-priced."
5,Nice cd holder,Bought several of these and I love them. The quality is great and the price isn't bad. Fast Shipper. Highly recommend!
4,"Great camera, horrible lens","If you can get this camera, GET IT. Just stay as far away as you can from the 28-80mm consumer lens this comes with! Spend the few extra bucks and get the 28-105 or 28-135 IS lens instead (or better yet, get some high quality prime lenses: 24, 50, 100, etc). Remember, it's not the camera that makes the image, it's the lens in front of it. The lens this kit comes with is a piece of garbage and you'll likely get the same images as you would from a $150 point and shoot. You'll NEVER get an acceptable 20X30 image from this lens or even a high-quality 8X10 for that matter. I've had the camera for a number of years and it's up to just about any task you can throw at it. Canon has a winner with the Elan II, but a dud with the lens they include in this kit."
5,Best of both worlds,"I traded a well-seasoned Minolta 700 for the IIe with eye-tracking. The IIe is more versatile and easy to use as a creative camera. It really can't be beat as a fully automatic, very fast and very quiet auto-eveything 35mm. Perfect for planned composition and point & shoot alike. Only regret is not opting for a longer zoom lens - - the 35-80 is good, but many outdoor shots cry for something over 100."
5,Photo Nut,"This is the BEST camera I've ever used. It is a great camera for beginners and for those on the pro level. Canon offers the BEST range of lenses, which I recommend buying the Elan II/IIE body and then a proper Canon EF lens (Ultrasonic 28-105mm or better). It matches perfect with the Canon 380EX Flash. The optional BP-50 battery pack + grip extension + verticle shutter button, all in one, is the perfect accessory to round out the perfect outfit! If you wear glasses or contacts, as I do, you may not be happy with the IIE (eye-controlled) model. I have the Elan II with a 28-210mm and have used it for everything from weddings, portraits, landscapes, architecture, family, flowers, etc. It beats my old Nikon, the Canon Rebel series, and Dad's Minolta! Truly the BEST for your money! SMILE...Jesus Loves You! :-)"
3,It's OK.,"If you desire for extremely good picture qulities, this is not the one for you, there are many many much better cameras out there! If you are just a light traveler who can not bear any extra burdens, or you are just lazy about learning anything complicate, then buy a smaller, easier and cheaper camera! but if you are not the two kinds of people above, you are just a regular guy who likes to take pictures, want nice pictures, and don't have $1300 to buy Top EOSs, this is the camera for you! At the end, I need to tell you that I DO NOT LIKE THIS CAMERA, AND I THINK THIS CAMERA IS BAD is not because it's really bad, but because that my EOS 3 ( which cost $1300) is one of the best 35mm camera in the world, and Elan II can't be compare with it at all."
2,Overpriced,"Even if this item wasn't on sale at most sites right now, they only cost around $9.00. $18.00 plus S&H is ridiculous."
5,Perfect gift for a Dita fan!,I absolutely loved the photography in this book! Very tasteful and beautiful. I especially liked that it is two books in one. Great coffee table book and a perfect gift for any woman/man who appreciates real glamour.
5,Burlesque by Dita von Teese,"I bought the book for my wife, for Xmas 2011. I don't think she has read it all yet, but I will try to get her to review it for you.Sorry."
5,Gorgeous book,"Gorgeous photos, beautiful layout. I love this book!! Brought a smile to my face. I especially love the double sided/flip feature. If you love Dita, you will love this book!"
5,Awesome,"With this book, the lovely Dita Von Teese shows that she is more than just a pretty face (and body), she has actually done her research! A very enlightening book."
4,Burlesque and the Art of the Teese/ Fetish and the Art of the Teese,"'Burlesque and the Art of the Teese / Fetish and the Art of the Teese' is a stunning look at the history of both Burlesque and Fetish from the point of view of one of the most famous models and Burlesque dancers of today, Dita Von Teese. It has stunning imagery and is well presented, without being lascivious or in poor taste. This book is class all the way. The various sections focusing on the history of both arts are fascinating, with information you would never have considered and you can tell Dita is both knowledgeable and passionate about her art. If you're a fan of Dita or just interested in Burlesque or Fetish then this is an excellent place to go, and though slightly unorthodox, this would make a wonderful coffee table book.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
5,DITA,"If you are a fan of DITA, burlesque, modeling, style, fashion, or photography this is a must own. It sat on my coffee table for years, but now is art on my wall."
5,Simply outstanding!,"The photography is superb, the layout is fantastic, the concept of two books in one is wonderfully unique. Buy this one in hardcover before it's gone and you're forced to buy a cheapy paperback later - an outstanding book and magnificently produced."
3,Burlesque and the Art of the Teese/Fetish and the Art of the Teese,"Content: 3 stars, some awseome photos, but alot of 'filler' images. Layout: 2 stars, general book layout is not an excellant design and lacks an edge that would suit the subject matter and artist. Doesn't have a special or unique design layout, binding or printing that is asscoiated with hardcover editions. This is maybe the reason for the low price.Overall: 3 stars."
5,The Best Of Erotic Beauty & Art,"This is a very well put together book about a very erotic and beautiful pin-up and fetish model, Dita. One of the better books I have bought about erotic sexual beauty, and yet can actually be displayed on your coffee table. A very nice addition to your pin-up model book collection, and a blast from the past......."
1,Sapranos DVDs,The product took more than a month to be delivered. Half the videos didn't play. Displayed only an error message. Working on exchange or refund now. Hoping for a better experience.
2,The Sopranos: The Complete Series,"The first 4-5 discs had quite a few jittery segments with bad pixellation. Fast forward to season 5 and I encountered the first instance of an episode that was unplayable, literally. It stopped right in the middle and couldn't be persuaded to finish. Also, quite a few times, when you select an episode, it plays a different one than the one you selected. Overall it's not as bad as I would have expected from a pirated product (among other things the packaging seems to be very professional and well made, but how would I know; I've never knowingly purchased pirated DVDs, and would be surprised if Amazon sold any), but way below what I find acceptable. And for the record, I have a brand new, mid-level DVD player of a recognized make. No excuses."
1,"Missing scenes, bad disks","I've been meaning to update this review. All in all the quality of the disks is pretty disappointing. Several scenes (on at least four separate disks) are bad and will not play. The entire Disk 3, Season 6, Part 2 is bad and does not play--which means an entire three episodes are un-watchable.I downgraded my rating to one star. I recommend you find a different put-up.------Has anyone else noticed that scenes seem to be missing? I watched the series on HBO very closely and I distinctly remember several scenes that are not on these discs.For example, the scene where AJ is scolded after locking Bobby's oldest boy in the garage. What happened?One of the discs in the first season skipped, but I haven't had trouble with any of the others playing."
1,Awful,"I bought The Sopranos The Complete Series as a Christmas gift....and it turns out that several DVDs do not work. Their blank...I'm not talking about 2-3 DVDs..I'm talking about 5-6,7 DVDs. How embarrassing! I wish I would have paid the extra and saved myself the hassle and bought elsewhere. Which I just did. I purchased for just a few dollars more at Walmart and not only is the giftbox much nicer, but the picture quality is great. I will never buy a boxed series from Amazon. Ever. Not worth the hassle."
5,sopranos,wonderful gift for yourself or adults whom want to watch the series from the beginning and enjoy at their own leisure
1,Never received item,"I ordered this series on 2/7/09 for my husband for Valentine's Day. It was expensive, I was charged, AND IT NEVER ARRIVED. Seller did not return my email. To make matters worse, the arrival date kept changing, as late as 3/7/09. Now it is passed that date and still no series."
3,A few glitches,"Great series. Be prepared to get hooked and make it a marathon. The dvds have a habit of just stopping in the middle of an episode but start up again right away, one disc was moderately scratched and one episode could hardly be seen or heard, but hey, there are 8 seasons to enjoy."
5,Great Value!!!,I ordered this for my husband's birthday. This was the best deal I found! Perfect way to collect the entire series.
1,Overpriced....,"I know this has been touched on before but as someone who owns the series i hate seeing people being ripped off.If you are to purchase this set individually it will only cost you $499.98 vs the box-set price of $579.98. Now that is the regular price, on sale it is $358.88 individually vs the box-set sale price of $514.98.... And there isn't anything special about this set it's just all the DVD's put together, so save yourself the money and buy em individually on the same order."
5,Complete series of Sopranos was great!,The Soprano complete series was great! the packaging and added features of bonus dvd and booklet on episodes made it a perfect package for my dvd collection.
2,Glue on DVD'S,Got the package from UPS package was fine it didn't have any damage to the box. My Wife open the box and open the first DVD in the middle of August and started to watch the first one. One night she was opening the DVD'S and she called to me to come look at something as I came into the bedroom she had two DVD'S in her hand and told me to look at them. I looked at them and two of the DVD'S had a thick clear glue like matter on them. It is a quarter inch wide and almost a inch long on both DVD'S so we could not watch those DVD'S.
4,The Sopranos - Complete Series,"I had been wanting this complete series for some time after becoming a fan of the show. I was very pleased with the price, and even more impressed with the efficiency and ease of receiving my DVDs. It is a beautifully boxed set and one that will bring many hours of enjoyment."
5,The Soprano The Complete Series,I can only review the shipping method which was very good. However I have not open the box since this is a gift for my husband for our 5 year anniversary on the 24th of this month. I will come back and do another review after he opens it. Thank you.
3,"great show, disappointing packaging","I purchased this after selling my boxed sets. I wish I had just kept them. The packaging consists of a cardboard box with a cardboard ""book"" that has cheap cardboard sleeve inserts for the dvds so I had to buy a new case to put the dvds in to prevent scratching (if you own the Sex and the City dvd collection its almost the same concept), the ribbon that lifts the ""book"" out of the box became detached right away and I notice creasing that developed in the cardboard pages which makes me think they will eventually wear out and tear the pages apart. Bonus features were very disappointing, I have the Sex and the City dvd collection and they had better bonus features. There could have been montages, farewell colllections, video clips, award show scenes or something. No interviews with James Gandolfini at all! I just think HBO went cheap considering the status and impact that this show had. Whaddya gonna do about it though right?"
1,"PLEASE READ...great show, but watch out for Amazon marketplace sellers offering this set for under $150!!","BUYER BEWARE...Fastastic show, BUT...it has been my experience that the sellers offering this set for dirt cheap are selling Chinese knockoffs. The Chinese knockoffs are really poor and no doubt illegal. In addition, I did some research and found out that selling these is against Amazon selling rules because they are a replica of a trademarked item. To all fellow buyers, please be careful of sellers who do not have a considerable outstanding history of selling quality DVD's! It seems that the sellers offering this set for $100-150 are the shady ones. Here's how to tell if the set being sold is legitimate. The UPC number for the legitimate U.S. set that is sold in retail stores is 883929022311. If it is anything else, then it is not a legit U.S. release. Then report the seller to Amazon!!! The real U.S. set is fantastic though!"
3,warning poor packaging,"I enjoyed this show and was glad to purchase at this price($119). I received the series today 1/7/2010 and the box was in good condition. I have not had a chance to watch the series, but will say that the packaging is poor and every disk that I took out of the glossy cardboard case had very slight scratches and disk imperfections. I don't know yet if any of the content will skip or if it will not play. I would recommend that if you buy this set you should also purchase paper or nylon sleeves (or even quality jewel cases)as you will not want to continually replace and remove these disks from the cardboard box because of the potential to damage them."
5,"Excellent Series, You'll Believe It When You See It","After watching it, it is very easy to see why the Sopranos is praised so often. The stories are fantastic and buying the complete series is the way to go. I love the special features and the inclusion of the two soundtracks! The packing could have been a little better, but I've seen a lot worse (Simpsons 11th season). All of the discs play perfectly, even though some had a few little scratches, but it didn't hurt the play. I'm very happy I got this :)"
5,excellent value,"My son was thrilled with this gift. Usually it costs almost $300 to buy, but this was such a great deal and when it came the contents were in perfect condition and my son was very happy."
5,Loved it.,"This is such a great series. I had never watched it before. My husband and I couldn't get enough. There were no problems with the discs either. I would definitely recommend this as a gift to your significant other so you can snuggle up together to watch. It also makes a great ""decoration"" in our family room :)"
3,Just Okay,"Not bad. Just okay. Music CD was disappointing with many of the good sound tracks from the series not on the CD. Additional scenes, not that great. Dinner with the stars and writers, was a little entertaining, but just okay. Always fun to watch the series again, though."
5,The Greatest Series Ever on Television,"The Soprano's is simply the greatest television series ever. From the acting to the writing it is an absolute masterpiece. Through the series you find yourself creating a bond with each individual character. Sooner or later you'll be even saying OH!!!! in everyday life. Not only is it about the Mafia Family but even more so the Family of Tony Soprano that makes it such a great piece of work. If I would have only one series to watch for the rest of my life, The Soprano's would be it."
4,The Sopranos,86 episodes and I'm sorry it's all over. The blood and guts. The morality play... How could you not like Carmella?
1,"Rip Off Artist, Beware","Now that I have finally gotten around to watching this set, many of the discs are defective and won't play. I have attempted to contact the seller, but have received no reply. Judging from other reviews, this seller appears to have been a rip off artist!!"
5,Fantastic !!!!,The Sopranos is one of the best TV Series ever. The producers couldn't have chosen a better cast. Every character just fits perfectly !! Highly recommended to anyone !!
3,Just SoSo,"The Soprano's was one of the BEST shows on T.V. I had to save up for this purchase and was very happy when it arrived. What upset me was the way the dvd's just slid into a cardboard like sleeve. Because of the way the dvd's slid in, they would not stay put without slidding even further down making it difficult to get to. On top of this mess, there was three episodes that completely froze up toward the episodes ending, I think the disc.'s were damaged because of the way they slide into position. So I did enjoy the Disc.'s that played without problem, but at the price I paid for this, I thought they should have used better care in packaging."
2,Where's the Blu-Ray version?,"Hey Amazon, when does the Blu-Ray come out? You're not going to sucker me by selling me this, only to hit me up for $500 more, for the Blu-Ray version!"
1,Was I the only Sucker for all these years?,"After getting hooked in the first season and faithfully watching and BUYING EVERY DVD SET and SOUNDTRACK CD marketed by HBO for this series, true fans recieve the final insult! HBO wants us to buy the entire series over again just to get the extras we didn't already have? Why were we loyal suckers for all those years? I wrote an email to HBO when this was announced and was bounced around to ultimately get no reply. HBO should do the right thing and market these extras as a set for those loyal fans who paid every year to have this series on DVD and CD, not slap us in the face. Call it ""Sopranos: The Cleaver Chronicles"". I'll be spending my hard earned monies on other products this holiday, since I am fortunate enough to still have a job. HBO, get us the True Blood DVD series pronto! May this Sopranos box set sleep with the fishes."
1,complaint1.,"Product sent to my home instead of to recipient. I requested that the gift be sent to a memphis address where the the recipient and I would be for Christmas. Instead the product is here in Baton Rouge and now I have to drive to post office, wait in line, and pay for it to be resent at additional expense."
4,Other Versions?,Has anyone here purchased the much less expensive version of the Complete Sopranos being sold by dvdsetshop for only $59.99? What do you think of their quality? Thanks
2,Sopranos box set,"The decription of the box set did say a little normal wear and tear on the box and that it was still in its factory packaging. However, the inside of the box set was also beat up and the entire set looked beat up and cheap"
1,The Sopranos Complete Series,Ordered this for my husband. It arrived in great condition but only series 1 and 4 accurately will play. This was his birthday gift and I am very disappointed in this a lot of money down the drain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Disappointed,"In each season there is one episode missing - it appears that the episode is there, but when you start watching it you find it is a duplicate episode that you've already seen. Most of the time it is the season finale. Very irritating to spend this much money and not even get all of the episodes.The Sopranos: The Complete Series"
2,"Caveat Emptor, Let the buyer beware","My husband and I really like the Sopranos, so I decided to buy the complete series for him. We have made it through 2 1/2 seasons and so far the content is accurate. However, the set that I received from the seller was not the set pictured above. The set I got has DVD regions 1,2,3, so it is intended for foreign distribution. The images, especially in the beginning of the episodes are sometimes pixilated. Also, there are special features on the DVDs but they have no sound. If you are looking to buy the complete series, my advice to you is to buy it from Amazon directly or from another big retailer to avoid any surprises."
4,"Great show, not so great package.","Series shipped very quickly, and the show itself is stunning.. However, like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired. It's kind of flimsy and not very well designed to remove and replace the discs. Plus it won't fit into a DVD shelf all that well.. Regardless, great product."
4,Sopranos Box Set,"The set I bought was the international edition. The discs aren't consistent in features, such as what each episode is about. Some of the discs have some weird Chinese characters as subtitles and some of the English subtitles make absolutely no sense whatsoever. Still, all the episodes are there, waiting to be watched. The price was why I bought them here at Amazon because the price at HBO is totally ridiculous."
5,That's Entertainment!,"This is seriously good entertainment. And with this package you get a lot of it for the money. If you didn't already know, it's not just a ""mob series"". It's much more multi-dimensional than that. My wife and I are both addicted! And as her brother told us, who'd seen it before, he enjoyed the program so much he's actually jealous that we're just getting to start watching it now. And he warned us not to watch it too fast, but to savor it, because we'll miss it when it's over. We already think he's right."
5,Great Deal,This is a great deal for any Sopranos fan. This has many interesting extras and doesn't disappoint. It was a new and came in it's original packaging. A must have!
4,sopranos review,"Until we purchased the full series, we only had seen a few reruns on A&E, but now we are completely hooked on the show...Our only regret is the series is not still being produced!!!"
3,Upgrade Policy and wait for the Compete Blu-ray release,"I have bought passionately complete release from season 1 to 6.2. And with this kind of release, there is no doubt that all die-hard fans of Sopranos will out this to their wish list.What HBO should do to their loyal fans:1. Give Upgrade policy, learn from Criterion which gave all their customers to upgrade their DVD to newer release with lots of goodies (including Blu-Ray) release, for $20 + S/h by just sending their original discs to the company. Then Criterion will send the new one with the new packaging.see http://www.criterion.com/asp/faq.asp#FAQ522. I will wait for Blu-Ray release of the complete series, and hoping for the English subtitle too."
3,Not all episodes work,"Obviously I love the Sopranos but when I started watching the season from the beginning, I noticed that some of the episodes did not work. Instead they repeated the first episode on the disc. There are several that are like this. I'm able to go to scene selection on season 2 so I can watch those episodes that way but not on season 1. Not sure if it is a dvd player problem or the disc problem but either way, kind of disappointed."
1,p'd off,"The Sopranos: The Complete SeriesI just recieved the soprano complete series (or so they claim its complete) last night. The first dvd i inserted was season 2 disc 1 episodes 1 to 3,to coincide with the last program that i watched per my on demand cable service. The dvd was season 4 (a duplicate) doesnt anyone check these. So i checked the rest of the dvd's and lo and behold season 6 part 1 disc 1 episodes 1 to 3 wont read on either of my dvd players (which are 2 months old) nor will my p/c player read this disc. So my so called ""COMPLETESET"" is missing a total of 6 episodes. Now mind you i havent tested if all the discs will play the episodes as listed. I just checked each one at the index screen."
1,Disappointed in Denver,"I ordered a product and waited out over 3 weeks and still didnt get it! I was so anxiously awaiting my set because my husband and I got hooked on this show through my brother and his wife. We were looking forward to spending some of our quiet time away from our 2 boys (which is almost never) watching the Sopranos. So, I just went to EBAY and found it cheaper and it got here in less than 3 days....so Thanks anyway!"
3,Love the series but some of the discs skipped and packaging is crap.,"The Sopranos series gets 5 stars but HBOs discs and their packaging doesn't. I had 3 discs that relentlessly skipped... no I didn't contact anyone about it, it wasn't in any ""good"" parts...lol.But my biggest complaint is the packaging... it's accordion folded somehow and glued and some spots weren't even glued right out of the box... which means the discs just fall out.. had to repair it twice already."
5,Awesome,"Exactly what you want, full series, cool graphics. Might as well get it. I got it for a friend as a present and he loved it."
5,Paradise Group Mkt.,"I had originally orderd the Sopranos complete set...the order was give to Paradise Groujp Mkting. I had some problems with some of the discs in the set. Paradise not only replaced the entire set but also provided me with some bonus dvds! They are a great organization to work with.James Upton203 Gall St.Philippi, WV 26416"
4,Sopranos,"Set of Sopranos is enjoyable, price was good. The additional inclusions proved very informative and added greatly to the enterainment value."
5,Great,"Had an issue with some discs not working properly, sent it back to amazon and filled out a replacement order. 3 Days later I had the new one (and I'm in NL, Canada) Easy transaction, Amazon was great to deal with, and an awesome box set!"
1,Disks do not play,"I am having the same problem as noted in other reviews and in the discussion forum for this box set - most of these disks do not play, and for the ones that play, they play only halfway through and will not forward to the next episodes. What a disappointment!"
3,"Great Series, Poor Product","The Sopranos series is one of my favorites. That being said, I would not advise anyone to buy this collection. There are so many discs that having even one of them not work makes it not worth it. Buyers would be better off getting each season individually as the chance of defective discs is less of a hassle since you don't have to send the enteire series back just for one or two defective discs. Personally, I could not play the dics on my playstation 2, which acts as my DVD player for my home theatre. The PS2 will play any other movies and HBO series just fine, but The Sopranos discs will only play reliably on my computer. I can usually get one or two episodes of each disc to work on my PS2, but then it becomes unable to read disc and I have to put them in my computer to finish watching them."
1,.,I received this as a Christmas gift. Two of the first three disks would not play properly. I love the series but the quality of the product is very poor.
4,The Sopranos collection,Bought this itrem as a gift for my husband. We love most of it. Occassionaly there are some scenes that we like to fast forward through.
2,the dvd freeze in the middle of the chapters,"My friends, I have All the sopranos seasons, but when I try to view the image freeze in the middle of the chapter (in every disc), I try different dvd player and even a blu-ray player but is the same, even in my computer the image freeze.I clean my dvd disc and the same.does anybody has the same problem?thank youraul rodriguez"
5,Sopranos - The Best Ever!,"So glad I waited 'til the HBO Sopranos series ended. Now I can watch episode after episode without waiting weeks and/or years to find out what's going to happen next. This is one of the best purchases I've ever made! Wow, wow, wow!! Great story lines and great acting! I recommend that every household should own the series!"
2,I should have listened to the other reviews,"Several reviews mentioned that because of the way the disks are packaged, that some discs arrive damaged and unreadable, and this was the case with the set I received. The very first disk was unplayable on all 4 of my DVD players in my house. I tried other disks in the set and some played perfectly but about 1 out of every 4 discs could not be read. I will have to return this set and buy the seasons individually."
3,Love the series.....not the discs,"I was so excited to find such a great value on this complete series. But maybe you get what you pay for? Whoever packed the gift box, did not have it in the right order and the discs were not in the correct sleeves. Pretty frustrating since this was a gift. My biggest complaint is that it was missing episodes 8-11 of Season 1! My other complaint is the fact that some of the discs make so much noise! I know its not the DVD player because I can put in other discs and it is quiet as a mouse. Amazon offered me a full refund if I returned everything, but they were out of stock on this so I couldn't get another one. So I bought the whole first season again (with a partial refund from Amazon)so now I have episodes 8-11 and duplicates of all the other ones from Season one, too! Love the series, but frustrated with the actual gift set packaging and quality of the discs. But not so frustrated that I wanted to return it for a full refund!"
4,not bad,"nice price for a series Ive always wanted to see from start to end-the packaging isnt the best-the whole series comes in a book that gives you episode rundowns,has extra musical cd and cloth bag that the book goes in then its encased in a sturdy box-that part is nice but the dvds themselves just sit in cardboard slots in the book.Great value tho for the price the gold box was selling it at!!!"
2,poor workmenship,"So far there has been a couple of disks that the plastic coating on the face of the disks are on the readable side, can't get it off so certain parts are unreadable."
1,WARNING - Buyer beware....,"This set looks good - all intact. But just try to watch these perfect looking disks - the picture suddnely freezes, skips, over and over again. Unwatchable. I later learned that this was a bootleg copy - of which thousands were made. I was out of a lot of money and had to re-buy seperate seasons. So you have to ask yourself, ""Do you feel lucky?"" Roll the dice, order this set - I hope you aren't 'stuck' like I was."
5,Killing time,Need to kill a few days get this series. ALOT of hours but easy to get hooked and into the story. Wish it was still airing as I wasnt into it at that time.
5,The Sopranos,This set of DVDs is excellent and should last until DVD players go the way of VCR tapes - a few years
5,Best Series EVER,"The gift set was the perfect gift! It arived on time and in perfect condition...if you are looking for a gift for your brother, father, boyfriend, husband-ANY man in your life-this is it!"
1,disgusting gross container,"I purchased the Box Set of Sopranos and was thoroughly disgusted when I opened it. The outside box (once you take off the fancy Sopranos overwrap) looks like something stored in a basement. It doesn't smell moldy, but looks like it had water damage. The liner notes have food splotches or some kind of stains on them (it's hard to tell as the paper is black). The DVDs are all in plastic bags, making me wonder were they originally in paper and were damaged? It is just so gross; very very disappointing. I did not open until Jan as they were a late Christmas gift, but as this was purchased in August and not opened to check it out (My mistake, I didn't think there would be any issues....there never has been from Amazon and I buy quite a few things). BUYER BEWARE no matter what check your purchase immediately!"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I purchased this item as a gift for my son. Since this is a complete series it takes a while to view all the dvds, I didn't know there was a problem at first. VERY disappointed. 2 of the disks are scratched / non-working. One of them being the last episode! Of course, it's past the return date so I'm out of luck. NEVER will I buy a dvd set or any dvd from amazon again. Beware - poor quality!!"
3,Not as interesting as most DK books,"This book just didn't interest my kids very much. Maybe it will when they're older (they're 4 and 6), but it's a bit dry."
3,Does not cover CS,"John von Neumann was a brilliant man, making significant contributions to quantum physics and higher mathematics. However, as this book says, ""Von Neumann is best known in the general public for his work in computer design. His activity in this field is very well documented inthe work of W. Aspray. Aspray's book contains quotations from many of von Neumann's letters concerning computer science; thus the current volume contains just a small selection of von Neumann's letters related to computers"".If you're interested in von Neumann as a computer scientist, buyJohn von Neumann and the Origins of Modern Computing (History of Computing)instead."
2,George Rickerson Only Scratched the Surface,"This book is not only inaccurate but it contains virtually some of the same text originally published in ""Alfa Romeo Spiders"" by David Owen in 1982. The similarity of certain passages is just too similar to be coincidence."
2,Chris Rees is not an expert,"One would expect a book with this title to be written by someone who is an Alfa expert. But twice in the opening chapter Mr. Rees states unequivocally that the original Alfa spider was designed by Bertone. This is, of course, ridiculous. All Alfa spiders have been designed by Pinifarina.The photos are good, and Mr. Rees appears to be thorough. It is just that the error about such a fundamental fact undermines my confidence in the rest of his work."
3,Bertone spider?,"There's no question that the production Alfa Giulietta Spider was by Pininfarina. But what about the photo of the Bertone prototype at page 18 of David Hodge's ""Essential Alfa Romeo"" (1995 ed.)?"
4,mostly awesome,"This collection includes the stories Pancakes, The Nature of the Beast, King Vold, Heads, Goodbye Mister Tod, The Varcolac, The Right Hand of Doom, and Box Full of Evil. There are also several pages of sketches at the end. The artwork is awesome, and the stories are usually pretty good. My favorites were Heads (Hellboy steps into a really freaky Japanese folktale) and Box Full of Evil, which is one of the longer stories of the bunch. Pancakes, one of the shortest, was pretty cute. This probably wasn't the best collection for a beginner like me to start with, but it wasn't bad. The only thing I really missed was a better insight into the characters involved - other than the Hellboy movie, I have absolutely not experience with any of the Hellboy characters, and I'm starting find out how different the movie is from the comics."
3,MY GRADE: B minus.,"These are a series of short stories about Hellboy from youth to maturity. It was mildly engaging and the last story with the Cthulhu references was the most interesting. The previous ones tried a bit too much for humor and only half delivered to my tastes. Some of the tales weren't developed enough, too. ARTWORK: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN READ: March to April 2012."
5,Men' red vest,"Great product. Very, very pleased with the quality and look of this vest. It came in great packaging and size was perfect.Thank you."
3,These Run Very Small,"The vest is not bad for the price, but they run very small. I normally wear only an XL, but I purchased a XXL so that I would have a little more room under a suit jacket. The XXL does not fit and could not be buttoned at all - not even close. I can't believe that I need a 4XL just so that it will fit properly. The 4XL should work fine for our Christmas Dance, but please note that these vests run real small. Otherwise, it seems OK."
4,Regional Geography of the United States and Canada,Even with the Christmas season I still recieved this book (expidited) in very good time... Thnx USPS & cheshire-lad... Book was a great bargin (new) and in great condition... Would recomend to a friend and order again... Thanks again for the no stress order...
4,a little dry,"A required book for school, it leaves a little to be desired. The writer is obviously from a huge metropolitan area, where population seems to be factor he is most interested in evaluating. If a region has no population, they are apparently not worth more than a few pages."
3,For Die-hard Fans,"I consider myself pretty-close to a die-hard Baez fan, but agreed wholeheartedly with the amazon.com review of this album. There is some terrific stuff here, including all of her classics. Some of the ""rare"" and ""live"" material was previously unreleased for good reason - they aren't Joan at her best or the recording quality is lacking. If you're truly a die-hard fan and need everything she's ever recorded, then you need this and may be thrilled with it. If you're not, go for some of her other, more-consistly wonderful CDs."
5,something in the way she sings...,"If you don't like Joan, so be it. But if you appreciate the mind-blowing beauty and clearness of her voice, this is the collection of her songs you must get.And, can an album that starts with 'Scarlet Ribbons' even be less than perfect?"
5,Joan Baez classics,"I was born in the mid 50""s and went to the Woodstock Festival in 1969,Joan was there and I loved her ballads and classical songs.I ordered this CD on Amazon and really enjoy the songs,she is a classy lady and her music soothes your soul!"
5,Oui to Chic and Slim!,"I am inspired by all of Ms. Barone's books. I read them out of order, but no matter. I have taken away ideas from each."
4,"A Great Singer, but Not his Greatest Songs","As a tremendous fan of Paul Robeson - I regard him as the greatest singer of all time - I have to say that whilst this CD gives some idea of his wonderful voice, it is by no means the best. In fact, my giving it 4 stars is too generous based upon the songs on the disk. If it were possible, I'd make it three-and-a-half stars, and still feel a little generous, when comparing Ballad for Americans with, ""Green Pastures,"" ""Big Fella,"" ""Paul Robeson"" (the CD), and ""The Voice of the Mississippi,"" all of which really do merit 5 stars."
5,"""Descended from David"", can't beat THAT genealogy!","A prose translation of Wolfram's ""William"", including a 13th Century illustration showing William's casque carrying a six-pointed gold star-with nothing else to identify him to the reader.No wonder there was no archbishop in Narbonne when Charlemagne wrote his will."
1,Crummy print-on-demand edition full of typos,"I haven't yet read this book, but I'm very disappointed to find that the brand new copy I bought is some sort of print-on-demand edition that looks like it was desktop-published. The paper stock is better than average, but the text quality is poor, and I've already noticed several typographical errors: on page 15, for instance, the block of text has unaccountably slid down to the center of the page; and on the back cover, the book is identified as ""Literaure"" [sic]. This is not the first time I have been disappointed by a badly printed Penguin, so from now on I will be buying used copies of Penguin books whenever possible. Apparently Penguin is now nothing more than a couple people with a desktop computer and an inkjet printer."
3,Totally mediocre novel about infidelity,"""Private Lies"" is one of those forgetable novels that rip-off a ""bodice ripper"" and try to probe serious questions. Well, it doesn't work, but it merits more than one star. Basically, there are two married couples, and everybody is doing everybody else. The adman loves the former ballerina and the computer whiz wants the do-gooder jet setter. A lot of sex ensues and a trip to Africa happens where adman realizes he'll never be Hemingway, and the path to lust and love maybe is cleared when one is the four is killed in an accident."
1,Love and Betrayal,"Ken and Carol meet again, years after the passionate and sultry love affair of their youth. Each married to others, they plot together to end Carol's marriage. They must find a way to keep her wealth from falling prey to her prenuptual agreement, which could leave her virtually penniless, which Ken knows all to well, not being a financial success himself. This book is so far off the mark - it's really all over the place, including a Safari complete with raging elephants, a drunken guide who speaks swahili and sex drives that are just too much to be of any interest to the listener (or reader). This is adult material, with far too much of the sappy description of private body parts and their functions, usually reserved for the romance novel set. Reader, David Dukes not particularly proficient at the voice characterizations on this one. My advice - don't waste your time on this audio cassette."
4,Not your typical equipment book,"I appreciate most about this book what it does that isn't typical of an equipment guide. It offers legal context for items. It lists common myths about weapons and the truth behind them. It gives results for the often silly and overly cinematic things that the players may try. It offers guidelines on how high a character's skill should be based on background and training, often giving creative means to justify having a score (Weaponry dots justified by playing baseball, for example). Lastly, it doesn't feel the need to provide lists and lists of weapons, rather it encourages the Storyteller to just use the stats of the most similar item provided. Not at all what I expected and I am very happy with it."
4,Armory delivers new options while keeping the system simple.,"Armory presents a wide variety of new weapons, vehicles, and equipment for any World of Darkness game. New fighting styles and other merits add many new combat options for characters, and the discussion of how real world equipment and weapons training works is very helpful. If you want more detail than the World of Darkness corebook offers, or just don't know a lot about guns and weapons, then this is a great product offering enough detail and discussion to flesh out equipment without overwhelming the reader with endless lists of identical weapons."
4,"We got Nukes, Knives, and Sharp Sticks","This book is good in some situation, but in not all. It gives the stats, costs and discriptions of a good number of guns, swords, knives, grenades, etc. Plus if you need a different type of vehicle than the generic car, you it lists different types and styles of vehicle, including heicopters and airplanes. I would recommend this book if you have someone in your game group that has to have thi kick @$$ smg, pistol, and armored vehicles. If you don't, save your money and stick with the stats of the guns listed in the World of Darkness core rule book."
5,Perfect combat resource for all NWoD chronicles,"This book is exactly what I hoped for, and more. It goes very in-depth on each main type of melee and ranged weapons: knives, kukri (and the skill needed to use them), swords (both ornamental and real), chain weapons, bows, blowguns, black powder muzzle loaders, chain guns...the list is exhaustive.But it goes further and adds information about skill specialties for certain exotic weapons, and provides players and storytellers with ideas on how the characters can learn to wield such weapons, and where to obtain them (legally or otherwise).And then the whole book is dotted with sidebars to help the creative juices flow for the storyteller, by providing simple ideas for plot/story starters, like what you find in the main rule books."
4,Chainsaws!,"This is the book that the Camarilla (official White Wolf Fan Club and World Wide LARP group) use for weapons and equipment. So, if you want your Stonebone Ogre High School Security Guard to have a tonfa with the proper stats, you have to have access to this tome.What I liked about it is the way they did non-standard weapons, such as chainsaws (difficult to wield, but have the potential to do a lot of damage)."
3,Not What I Expected.,"As the previous reviewer stated, it's okay but not what I expected. I agree that someone must have found it necessary to tone the sculpt down. I really can't figure out what they added to the back...Is it a cape? It just looks odd. I will add that I would have given this 4 stars if the photo had been accurate. I do think that anyone who likes Wonder Woman will like this bank, but keep in mind the actual piece is quite a bit different.I know in the future I won't order products from Monogram until I've seen reviews. The sad thing is this new sculpt would be fine on its own, but considering what they were promising, I'm disappointed."
5,REALLY the best!,"Wow- this really is the best muffin and quick bread cookbook I have ever seen. The recipes are great and I love that there is nutritional information about each recipe. I started to turn down the corners of the recipes that looked good, until I realized that I was turning down every page. A must-have for anyone who loves to bake."
3,"Not bad, but cover a little deceiving","A good book, but the situation outlined on the back cover doesn't take place until hundreds of pages into the story. Not good for fans of the 2nd Amendment, though..."
4,"Fantastic book,great reading","the book kept me all night,I really enjoyed this book. the action in it was great. the characters in the book really kept me interested. I couldn't hardly wait for the next one to come out."
5,All I can say is David Drake...move over.,I thought the book was well written. I am a war veteran and the imagery the book brought to me reminded me so much of my own experiences both in Panama and then in the desert. The young man in the book reminded me so much of myself before Panama and the older veterans so much of myself in the desert. I look forward to the next book in this series.
4,A great Military SF Heros in action,The action builds and comes to a power packed ending.. I've been looking for the next book it won't get here fast enough.. loved the story the characters are great.. I need More of this....
4,Surprise! Better then I thought,I have been reading about this book for sometime now. I never got around to picking it up. I would read the reviews and decide against it.Well I should have picked this up a long time ago. I finished this book very quickly.The story is great the characters are great it's a very enjoyable story that moves quickly. It is obvious that the authors draw on their military experience. I think it lends the book an additonal layer of authenticity. I found myself concerned with the plight of Srg.Bass and his unit. My only gripe is that the real action was a bit later in the book and it was too quick for me. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the portion of the book about their training as well. I'm glad to also report that their are serval more books in the series. If they are as good as this one I will be a happy reader.Don't even think just buy this book!
3,Where's the Text to Speech ??,"I'm tell'in ya now. I'm not going to pay for a Kindle book that does not have Text to Speech enabled. This feature was the number 2 reason for me to purchase this device. This is an extremely important feature for those with vision problems. However, having said that, I got the book because it looked really interesting and it was free. And if Text to Speech had been enabled, I would have still gotten it. It's worth paying for. So, my rating is slightly lower because of the Text to Speech not being enabled. But the book is well written and I think the folks who like Military Sci-Fi will enjoy it."
2,"Stick to military SF, leave PC out of it","Starfist lived up to the expectations of exciting and action-packed military SF, right up to page 198, where the authors chose to pontificate on their anti-2nd-Amendment political views, and at the same time take a public dump on another SF author. They should stick to military SF and keep their poltiical correctness to themselves. They don't have the skill to blend both."
1,Basic Training Reduex,"Um, no thank you - 100 pages of Basic Training - Military Sci Fi should be about those already trained UNLESS the training has some special information or purpose - Yeah, I know that the authors are both ex-military - so am I, and I do not need to relive Basic with Laser Guns with guys that are boring, DI that are generic and nothing actually happens - this is more of a info dump beginning - no purpose and no desire to continue - thanks for nothing."
4,Old Timey Concert,"If this album had a scratch and sniff it would have the fragrance of mountain dew trickling out of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Sad ballads and even sadder love songs. Three virtuosos, two rarely recorded, turning Carnegie Hall into a barn dance."
5,Great book!,"This is an awesome book. I felt like I was journeying to the ends of the earth with Peter Lourie. This guy has a talent for putting you right in the place he's writing about. His photos are vivid and eye catching. I've got a 4th grade nephew who will love this book for his birthday. If you know a kid that enjoys history, exploration and interesting nonfiction, buy this book!"
4,Better on second listen,"I didn't like this record much when I was a kid, but after hearing a bootleg of session outtakes, I heard excellent music.After re-listening to it after that, I have a new appreciation for this record.I think the words were what annoyed me the most about it.Now I just tune that part out & enjoy the music."
5,The Stones Rock Forever,"The reason I bought this is because my copy went missing...very suspicious. But this is one I can't live without. I love the whole thing from first to last song. I""m an old lady with a BIG pump for the boys."
4,"Great Early Work, Surprising Sounds","This CD captures a very early sound.Cool, Calm and Collected has a rich sweet but powerful melody to itSomething Happened to Me Yesterday is a unique piece too.On the whole it's a unique sounding CD of The Rolling Stones that I recommend."
2,Disappointed,I ordered the book with the pretense that it would have been complete with the CD study guide that it is supplied with when purchased. It was NOT stated on the the order list or at any time during order that an accompanying CD was not included. This CD is a feature of the book that was my BIGGEST reason for ordering and needing this study guide book. If you really truly read this post I hope that someone responds in regards to my disappointment. Amy
3,ok,My teacher said not to use it because it contradicted the text so i stop using it. haven't picked it up
4,Good for overall studying,"I used this book to study for my comprehensive HESI finals at the end of my first semester and I found it to be helpful! I purchased it because I thought it would be divided into sections, i.e. pharm, patho, etc., but it was not. It's still pretty easy to find information regarding a particular system because they're split by chapters."
2,Daunting and boring,This book is just too large and daunting with not enough illustrations. It frustrates me so I am going to order a different nclex review book. Maybe I can use this one as a reference because it is chock full of information. It is just debatable whether you need all of this information or not.
4,Excellent resource!,"I used this book primarily for studying for the NCLEX. I LOVED it!!! I would absolutely recommend it to anyone! It helped me pass the NCLEX with 75 questions..Just beware the CD-Rom does not work with Macs, which was kind of annoying, since they say it does...."
3,Helpful,This is very helpful. The book is excellent but the cd does not offer many questions in study mode
4,Fantastic Review Book but CD doesn't work on Macs,"This book was INCREDIBLE! I just took the NCLEX-RN last week and passed with 75 questions. The review questions are phenomenal & they prepare you very well for the NCLEX. If you pace yourself & go through the entire book with the review questions at the end of the chapter, you will definitely pass. Although the size of the book can seem very overwhelming it is definitely worth it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the cd does not work on a Mac. I had to borrow a friends computer so I was able to use the cd. But, overall, it's a wonderful book. The book is so helpful that you honestly don't need to even use the cd. Definitely a great decision to buy this book!"
5,Absolutely Love this Book!,I am currently in nursing school and I use this book to help study for tests or reinforce what I have learned in class rather than to study for the NCLEX and I love this book. It has a wide variety of topics and for each question it explains why a certain answer is correct and why the other choices are not correct. The rationales really help you understand concepts that you may not have mastered. Excellent book and I would recommend to any nursing student!
5,The best in this category!,"I only studied for this book to passed succesfully the NCLEX exam! I recommende it for averybody! If I will take the exam again, I will study for the same book!"
3,"Very In depth, but overwhelming","This book was great as a companion to my class, note I say class. Depending on how long you intend to study for the NCLEX, I would say the longer you will study the better. Otherwise this book has way too much information. The good thing? It has exclamations stating important NCLEX information....if you are pressed for NCLEX study time, then I would suggest you only read these points, otherwise, get another book. My CD arrived broken so I have been unable to use it, but there are many other resources, and I am told you really only need 2 MAX nclex review book. But you can never have too many questions. I do not regrt buying the book, it helped me pass my class."
4,Prentice Hall Reviews & Rationales Comprehensive NCLEX RN,"This book is a great supplement while you are in nursing school. Class exams are given in NCLEX format and the rationales help nail down the reason for the ""most correct"" answer. I use it as a study aid when preparing for exams. If you are a first semester student, I advise you purchase this book."
1,CD doesn't work for MACs,"The book is fine, but I bought it for the CD, which will not work on my MAC. The book specifically says the CD will work on MACs, so it is very frustrating and I will be returning this book for one that comes with a working CD."
4,"Lots of info, but...","I was excited to get this book because it came highly recommended by my nursing instructor. The book does have a TON of information in its 1450+ pages, but I have some problems with it.* It doesn't contain many illustrations or charts* I have found many errors both in the book and on the CD* The CD repeats a lot of questions even though it has over 5000 on it* I wish it would but the diseases together with the drug treatments to avoid flipping from chapter to chapterOverall, it's a pretty good book and has every piece of info on everything imaginable. If you are a visual learner like me though, you probably won't like it."
2,Disappointed - Not as good as they used to be.,"Soft & comfortable, but the padding is VERY thin -- not like the last Dearforms I bought at the store."
4,warm and comfy,These slippers are warm and comfy. The only complaint I had is on one side the little plastic tag didn't go all the way through the slipper - it was stuck somewhere inside and I had to resort to pliers to pull it out through the bottom so I wasn't walking on it all the time.
4,Soooo soft,"These slippers are made with the softest material I have ever felt. Cushy for your tooties. True to size. Wear great. Maybe a little too warm for the summer, but they were so soft I wore them in 90 degree days anyway.Dearfoams will last forever. My last pair of Deafoams was 5 years old before they bit the dust."
4,Comfy Slipper,"These are super comfy and warm. Did not have a problem cutting out plastic tagging. I am a size 91/2 and ordered L. Wish that they had a better sizing chart. With the L my heal rested on the seam in back. However, after a few months they have stretched to fit less snug and I am off the seam. Liked the idea that I could wash, but afraid to since on one slipper the base liner has come undone. The base is sewn in. Maybe if I had a larger size. Overall, I like them. Glad to see price down. With shipping total price was $24. But couldn't find the flat base and microfiber anywhere else."
4,Comfy,"Pretty comfortable. Good Quality. Warm. Nice. My parents appreciated them for Christmas.Ccolor was a little faded, but ove all a good buy."
3,Diverse info on the subject.,The author presents great info on this subject and to get a greater veiw with this get Timothy Myers El book Huevolution of Sacred Muur Science and Zachary Gremillion book African Origins of Freemasonry. The reveiwer below must have not read this book or Winters to make such assertions.
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"As a huge Counting Crows fan, I thought it was kinda cool when I came across a tribute album to them...right up until the time that I listened to the cd. It is nearly impossible to get through. The best way I can try to explain it is to call it bad karaoke. I rated it one star because there's no ""0 star"" option. If you have any intentions of buying this cd, find a website where you can preview it first, and thank me later."
5,Love this Album,"This Album rocks. I love each and every song on it. I remember I was CRAZY about the Power Rangers, and to this day at age 23, I still love the Original 1993 show. I don't care much for the new show."
3,"THIS IS A DSD REMASTER, SO YOU CAN'T COPY EVEN TO YOUR MP3","There's no indication on the Amazon description that this is a DSD Remaster. What's the difference? You can copy it to your computer and play it, but you can't copy it to any other device or blank CD. They should let the buyer know beforehand. I'm sending my copy back. The music's good, but I want to be able to play it without being at my computer."
1,another stones sacd ripoff,"Yeah, the music is great. Blah blah blah. We all know the music is great. But seriously, what's up with this SACD junk? I'm not gonna pay $20 CDN for a hybrid-SACD. And I don't have a SACD player and refuse to get one. I really don't think the sound quality is gonna be what they market it to be. It's definitely not going to be that good that it covers the ridiculous price that they charge. If they're gonna remaster it like this, at least keep on printing the originals so they're affordable (kinda like with the Bob Dylan catalogue). And if you're gonna remaster it and charge this high a price, AT LEAST PUT SOME BONUS MATERIAL IN THERE."
4,The Sound Quality is Great.,"I have a SACD player, but even the CD layer is great on this CD. I bought 3 RS remasters, and while playing Beggers in the car (CD layer), I decided to stop at another store and buy High Tide and Green Grass. I will buy more.Right now, I'm having difficulty deciding which is my favorate of the remasters. It's between Let It Bleed, Beggers Banquet, and High Tide, Green Grass. Aftermath (US)is recorded well, but some of the cuts are not that interesting to me.For a week now, I've been playing the Stones in my car, on my computer, and at home on my SACD based Home Theater System. I can't get enough of these remasters."
3,Original GTA,"This has the original GTA game and comes with GTA London 1969 also. The game is dated but this is what got the GTA series started. The main problem with playing a game this old is you can't save it in a PS2. You must have an original PS1 game card to save it to, and the PS2 won't recognize a PS1 card. The game won't save to a PS2 card. So either buy a PS1 to play and save it on or try to play without saving your game."
5,Review from a friend,"I bought this book because Dene is my friend and I'm supportive that way (and I thought it would be cool to have a book on my coffe table signed by the author.) I wasn't planning on writing a review, though, because that sort of thing is kind of cheesy, don't you think? But anyway, I opened it up and started reading, and couldn't stop laughing.I found Together 4ever absolutely perfect for perusing alone in a coffee shop or giggling over with buddies in the break room. I wanted to throw a party right away so all my friends could enjoy using it to break the ice.I never finished it, although I'm dying to. In fact, I'm here to get another copy. Couldn't get past flipping through it, then dropping it to cross my legs and crack up, before giving my only copy to a cute guy I just met. He loved it so much we're good friends now, the book is that good.For what it is--and I have a lot of integrity so don't take it lightly--I give my friend Dene's book 5 stars."
3,Like going back to jr. high school...,This book was a lot of fun and took me right back to junior high school. It made me wish I had kept all my old notes from school! They would be a kick to read again.
1,What a rip off!!,"I ordered 3 boxes of these, not knowing how much each box sold for in stores. I happened to pass through the Crayola section at Walmart and found the 96 count crayon boxes are actually $5.97 ...not the $10 + dollars per box that I had spent. These are going back for sure."
5,Crayola 96 Classic Color Pack,"The Crayola Classic Color Pack with 96 colors is great. The product arrived on time and in excellent condition. As always, the crayons were very high quality and the color just glides onto paper. Definitely makes for an enjoyable coloring experience with my 2-year-old twin toddlers. The variety in colors is also excellent; there's a color for just about any situation that you can imagine, ranging from mango to mahogany."
1,Agreement,"I must agree with ""a software user from Germantown, Maryland"". This game STINKS! I have never used any thing worse in my entire life. I have played flight simulators of all sorts for years. This is the WORST!"
5,A release in the spirit,A Letter to My Sisters: The Way OutI am indeed invigorated and ready to proceed into the future. This book helped me to break away from the bondage of things that had been sitting in my way for a while. Thank you Lady Beth for sharing you revelation.A Letter to My Sisters: The Way Out
5,Breaking Free,One of the best women's Bible studies I have done - life changing! I highly recommend this for Christian women - no matter their maturity level.
3,the workbook is better,"The book is fine and it's cheaper here on amazon than the workbook. However, any of Beth Moore's studies/books are always better in workbook form because the workbooks make you stop and reflect on the information given. The workbooks give you time for things to sink in."
1,Misleading information,"I bought this book labelled as very good conditon. It was, but what was not said was that the first hundred pages of this WORKBOOK were filled out IN INK and large partsBreaking Free: Leader Guide Updated Edition-The Journey, The Storiesof the questions highlighted in yellow by the original owner. A friend who also bought the book upon recommendation also had the same problem. A filled in workbook is NOT ACCEPTABLE as a sale item and I am surprised that the owners would even consider doing this to the purchasers, considering the subject of the book!"
2,Breaking Free Workbooks,I was not happy to receive the Beth Moore workbook Breaking Free to find the first 3 chapters were missing. I would have appreciated the seller informing me that some pages were missing fromt the workbook.
3,Help!,"I liked the game, but I could never get past level 5. My friend had it on her computer, But I can never find it anywhere!"
1,Don't Get this GAME!!,"This is one bad game. The graphics are bad, the controls are horrible, your character moves weird, sound is messed up. This game is sux."
1,DON'T BUY IT!,"The characters are ugly. When they are not beautiful, or handsome, don't buy the game."
1,Physically Bad Product,The DVD would not play. It was returned but could not be replaced as the seller had no additional copies
5,A BEST OF with a difference,"With so many artists pushing out endless compilations of their old material, it's refreshing to see that Darden, original as ever, does it a little differently. So this one's worth buying even if you've got all of his other albums. And you get one new song.Okay, some of these versions aren't THAT different from their original versions, but some are - Loving Arms on solo piano for instance... maybe worth the money for that alone.In some ways I prefer the ""Deep Fantastic Blue"" material on here than on the album, just like I do when I hear him ""live"". And there is a bit of ""live"" recording here, with some judiciously edited applause in the background.If you're unfamiliar with Darden's work, what's wrong with you? Start here so you can decide which one to buy next."
2,Smith Wigglesworth book,"I knew that product was used, but I did not expect any personal comments, marks and writing in it! For me a used book is used but not written and highlighted and so on."
2,Here's hoping the full album is better.,"I love Breath From Another. It's seriously my favorite CD ever, by anyone. Considering that, I just can't get into this EP. There are a couple tracks I like (not love), a couple I'm indifferent about, and one I think is absolutely terrible.I like Gone, This Lullaby, and I Drive Alone. They remind me of Breath From Another - obviously not the same, but to me they are the kinds of songs I would expect.I hate Every Day is a Holiday With You. Not only is it a cheeseball song that I would expect to hear from the artists Esthero is apparently rallying against, but her voice just doesn't work for it!The title track can be a little catchy, but the lyrics are insipid and used. I really don't get Amber and Tiger's Eye...I think it's dull.All in all, I'm still going to buy the album to see what direction she chose to go with her music, since this EP is definitely all over the place."
2,Ehhhhhh....,"As a fan of Esthero's debut album, I was excited to hear this new EP. However, the only halfway decent song on the album is the title track. The rest of the songs are a mix of oddly sorted tracks that really don't offer much substance. The songs don't really fit into any musical genre and even the sultry beats on GONE are just boring. You would expect something a little more LASTING for someone who declares her outrage over all the ""sh*t that is played on the radio""...This album just isn't very good. I am just glad that I didn't pay for it and managed to get a free burned copy."
1,I was very disappointed at the first sight...,"...I realized this costume, saying that it fits up to sized twelve was pretty much nothing compared to the descripition. This is not even a costume that a teen can wear, more like a 9 yr old and under. The mask is so small, it doesn't even look like the one in the movies,..., plus this costume is so small, and doesn't really fit the description. I recomend dont buy it or youll wanna get a refund, honestly."
5,love,We love it the costume My son is extrememely picky and he loves it. Fast delivery and all. Thank you!!!
3,Ghostface Costume,The costume ripped very easily. That was disappointing! The item was shipped fast and I received everything that was stated in the sale.
5,"'THE ROLLING STONES NOW!"" ... and forever!","What can I say after all these years? ""The Rolling Stones Now!"" is still astonishingly good. It cooks from the get-go, and ""Down The Road Apiece"" has been used by me in more ""mixtapes"" than any other Stones' song. Back in '64-'65, they were so exotic to a 16 yr. old kid from Kankakee, IL! Little did I know this music would stand the test of time & still give me thrills. DAMN, they were good! Literally changed my life. Thanks, Lads!! See you ""Down The Road Apiece""!"
3,"Pre-Satan, its mostly rubbish","Why doesn't anyone have the courage to come out and say early Stones is pure rubbish. The Stones are one of my favourite bands, and I even own quite a bit of the early stuff - but IMHO a compilation is about enough to own. Don't get me wrong, I probably own more Stones CDs than any other band (except Jethro Tull, and would be the Beatles if they'd simply made more). But early Stones I find very hard to listen to, and for that reason never do so. People compare the Stones to the Beatles - but listen to their early recordings side by side and there's absolutely no comparison. Of course, from 1968 onwards its a very different story."
5,Baby you gotta good thing goin',"This is the best of the Stones. Although Brian Jones had his personal idiosyncracies you can't fault him on his musical accomplishments. Rhythm guitar and harp playing are what made this band come together. The whole organization is kept moving by Charlie Watts who is the standout artist on this particular outing. His rim crashes make each one of these tunes a keeper. By recording in three blues locations the band overcomes any black/white analogies, criticisms etc. With the help of Muddy Waters et al they learned their roots and weren't afraid to demonstrate them on this master disc. 'Now' points to the blues and each guitar and drum beat make this a house rockin' band which grabs you immediately. This is still the way it feels after 40 years. Right on!"
5,Classic STONES!!!!!!!,This is awesome The original stones as they were when we knew them. My stepson and His mother and I were able to really enjoy this album together as a family. Kids these days wish they had new groups like THE STONES.
4,Impressive incipient mastery of the blues for Jones et.al.,"One of my favorites. Just one listen, and you may be convinced that this is what the Stones were (and are) made of, rhythm and blues. They raised quite a stir in Chicago in Chess Studios, and gained the support of many of the great bluesmen there, an indication perhaps of the Stones dedication to their craft. ""Oh Baby (...Good Thing Goin')"", ""Everybody Needs Somebody to Love"", ""Down Home Girl"", ""Down the Road a Piece"" are just a sample of their versatility on this album, which I consider an essential to their early roots. Hard to believe it's been forty years, and still going."
4,"Rolling Stones, NOW!","It's strange to still be in love with the music you grew up with. I'm 59 now and I can remember spinning this LP when I was 14! The Stones have long proven their greatness, and this album is the beginning of that greatness. This SA-CD, like all of their SA-CDs, is a revelation sonic wise. If you can still get it in SA-CD, then do so."
4,Pinion Yoke Kit,Most of the parts in my kits where Dana and Spicer parts so at least you know that they are not some cheap china import.
2,Not for the Sensitive-Skinned Babes,"This set is very tasteful-yet-fun, unlike some of the tacky-looking, busy-patterned ones you see all the time. And the animals are very cute; my daughter enjoyed the ones on the crib bumper especially. But geez, the material is rough to the touch. The quilt is so stiff, and too small to be useful, really."
1,Junk but at least it can be returned,"The longer clamps don't clamp, but moveable half just slides freely along the bar. Tried moving the release lever back and fourth but it made no difference. Then one of the handles broke.They may be expensive, but they sure are junk."
5,Great Clamp Set,"I bought this set to build cabinets and cabinet doors... It is perfect for this work since it holds everything in place while you make fine adjustments. I have received the set and it is heavy duty and well made. I may not use these clamps for ""quick hold"" jobs but whenever I need lots of force and precision... these should work well. As others have said, watch the sales since the price varies quite a bit. When I bought them, Amazon had the best prices with free delivery and they came quickly."
5,Excellent Clamps,"These clamps are great. Easy to grip handle, good pressure, large clamping area. Very good product."
5,Jet 70411 Parallel Clamp Set,"These clamps are the best, even better then Bessey. I have over 50 of the different Jet parallel clamps and use them side by side with the Bessey every day. After they are tight the Bessey are really difficult to loosen, these jet with the big handle are so much easier on the hands! These DO get discounted! I have purchased them for 1/2 price at a different site many times and just purchase 16 of the 50"" clamps for 23.00 each! The combo set I purchased for 89.00! Even here on Amazon I purchased the 98"" for 44.00 so keep your eyes open Amazon changes the prices everyday! Check the other woodworking stores, amazon better start offering the same deals or they will lose a ton of sales. Jet clamps rock, but Bessey has a new clamp in the works and I am sure it will rival these or even be better. 129.00 including shipping and NO tax is a great price Amazon I will take more!"
5,Great Clamps with Features!!!,"I have a number of Bessey clamps and decided to try the Jet clamps. The added features make the Jet clamps even better than the Bessey. They are a little heavier, but the trigger pull keeps the clamps from slamming together when you hang them up."
2,I have it.,"Have not had an opportunity to read it, or use it yet. I look forward to challenging it in the future as I need to to use, and will know then if was worth the purchase."
4,good book,Our daughter's piano teacher asked her to get this book. Her teacher really likes it and my daughter seems to be learning from it easily.
4,Easy for kids,Good explanations for kids. Easy to understand. Just the right format for somebody that is just starting to play piano.
5,Nostalgic piano book still inspires,"My father taught me to play piano with the Schaum series over 60 years ago. I like to keep this at my house to inspire grandchildren to play on my piano. It was funny to see how words were updated such as ""computer"" in place of typewriter."
4,Recommended for young piano students,"This series of piano instruction was recommended by another piano teacher. Its illustrations, suggestions, fun songs and progression are excellent for young piano students."
4,Great for young students - easy to use,"This book is a great tool for young students just getting started with learning piano. It walks you through the very basics of how a piano works, the letters for the keys, the numbers for your fingers, etc. It is visually appealing, which is a benefit for kids. There are even notes to the teacher to help guide learning throughout the book. It starts with simple number melodies and then begins to introduce music notation.The only area where the book is lacking is practicing rhythmic notation by itself. Many students have difficulty when it comes to playing rhythms...and especially keeping a steady beat. It is certainly easy enough to supplement the book with my own materials, but it would be nice to have it all in one book."
5,Enhanced with stunning full-color photographs,"Seahorses by Twig C. George is a children's picture book that introduced young readers to these amazing creatures with a text of interesting, entertaining facts enhanced with stunning full-color photographs and showcasing a wide variety of seahorse species. A wondrous and wonderful introduction to these beautiful creatures of the ocean, Seahorses is a delight to page through and very highly recommended for both school and community library Pets/Wildlife collections."
5,Great Live Album From A Great Band,"This is a such a good live album the only acttuall good live album from the stones in the 60s songs like, jumpin jack flash, sympathy for the devil etc. all sound fresh and new on this cd. This would of been a great concert to see of the rolling stones this is the stones when they still sounded fresh and new live in concert buy this cd if you still dont have a live album of the rolling stones"
3,"Not enough ""Life!"" in this live album.","If the definition of ""Ya-Ya"" is ""fun"" then you will be needing to get some of yours out since there's not much to be found in this album. Don't get me wrong, the band sounds great. Its just that for a (live) album it's ""life less""... even the audience is too well behaved. It all sounds so very mechanical, just another day at the office for Mick and the boys.Unless your a die hard stones fan or a collector needing to complete your catalogue I suggest getting the studio versions then clap and whistle at the end of each track, you'll get the same effect."
2,Get Yer Ya Ya's Out,This is one of my favorite Stones albums. ...Like I said.. I Love this album ....
4,Ya-ya!!!,"Although somewhat overrated in my opinion (Live in Leeds it's not), it's one of the best live RS records available, in my top three with Love you Live and Stripped."
5,Tight and loud,"Their sound was a bit more raw back then but still very tight. I like hearing the lesser known hits such as Love in Vain, Stray Cat Blues, and Little Queenie."
2,NOT an SACD,"Amazon needs to update their listing of their Stones discs. This and the others like it are NOT SACDs (Amazon states they are hybrid SACDs). Not true. They are DSD remasters on CD. Big difference. I'm only keeping it because I didn't own the disc anyway. Buyer beware.Two stars is for the deceptive description, not the music."
5,Best Sympathy,"This is still the best Live Stones. Period. Maybe more importantly, it's the best version of Sympathy For the Devil - and that's saying a lot!!! My only regret is it contains nothing from Sticky Fingers and Exile, arguably the two best rock and roll albums of all time. Of course, that's only because those albums came out after Ya-ya's - ""you can't always get what you want"". This is a must own."
5,Remaster definately worth it.,"Another reviewer, ""exileonmainst"" has questioned the value in the remastering on the Stones' ABKCO releases. Take it from me. I replaced my old cds with the new remasters, and I can assure you that the remastered versions are FAR SUPERIOR to the old releases, and I do not own an SACD compatable cd player. ABKCO's previous releases have been remixed, making the track less muddy sounding at high volume. The level of clarity is amazing, and the mixes have been opened up to allow for a fuller sound. Definately worth the price of the new CD."
5,They Used to be Great,"Young people who know the Stones only as an ""oldies"" band that charges outrageous prices for medicore concerts should sit down and give this disk a listen-this is the work that got them their reputation. Recorded over 30 years ago,this is probably the best live album ever released.It is true that this band is now something of a joke,but there was a time...and fortunately it was recorded! .... There really was a time when the Rolling Stones were(as they themselves brag on the intro)The Greatest Rock and Roll band in the world. ... But this album was made when they were still young and strong and cared."
5,Faithful reproduction of a classic vinyl,"Another ""well done!"" to whoever engineered this onto vinyl.I think this the Stones' best live album ever. These live versions (of earlier, studio recordings) are so pleasingly different, that I love listening to both.I think this is also the Stones' 'heaviest' album - in that wonderful Cream-Zeppelin sense. Mick Taylor approaches Jimmy Page in his solo (2nd solo, first is Keith) on Sympathy For The Devil.The amount of banter (Mick with the audience) is just right too.Well done to the U.S. fans who obviously inspired such a classic performance from the Stones in November 1969 at New York's Madison Square Garden. Some people in here in Australia (I'm an Aussie) & the U.K. 'bag' 'the Yanks', but it was the U.S. audiences who appreciated the British Invasion the most.A great heavy, but danceable rock album."
5,"""you devils""","I tell ya what this is wicked stuff. At their pinnacle, with Mick preening and teasing. Keith as always the driving force of the band. Mick Taylor now fully ensconced. And the base of it all solid and creative always and forever.. Bill and Charlie. Moments before they launch into THE best version ever of 'Sympathy for the Devil', A female voice is yelling for 'Paint it Black' ""Paint It Black you devils!"" She didn't get her request , but I doubt she was disappointed. I wasn't. You won't be either."
5,Better than C# for Dummies,"Well thought out with a good progressive flow for the reader, starting with the basics and then dealing with all the fundamentals intrinsic to a well-rounded education for the programmer."
3,"Very good for beginners,..but","I'M in the fifth chapter of this book. For the most part, I think this is a great book, especially for beginners. My only complaint is that some of the programs are hard to follow because the author doesn't tell you when he's editing a previous program or starting a new file all together. You are given new snippets of code combined with some of the old ones, having now idea how to put it together. I think this book may be a little better in a class with an instructor. Apart from this one complaint, I would have given it five stars."
1,I strongly do not recommend this book for a beginner,"I have over 10 years experience in IT, but I am not familiar with Object Oriented Programming. So I took a brand new C# course offered at a local community college and they used this book as the text for the class. They will not use it again. All 12 students in the class concur with the decision of the IT department, but wonder why the book was chosen in the first place.The book is not structured, sample programs are broken up into pieces and displayed on different pages and it is not clear at all as to what is happening. Most of the time that you spend reading the material you waste on trying to figure out how numerous silly game programs work, rather than on how to construct code properly."
5,If you're interested in The Book of Kells then this is for you,Watching this dvd is like being given a little tour through the Book of Kells and the history surrounding the tradition of this type of manuscript and the methods used in it's creation. I found the section onstylized metal work and engraving and the influence it shared with calligraphers to be fascinating. Watch & enjoy!
3,The Book of Kells,"Just one comment: This DVD needs subtitles. I am hard of hearing, and I could not get much from the material. Sad. I'm sure I would have enjoyed the DVD much more if I could have followed along with the spoken word."
