3,"Dreadful Hilary, Good Other than Hilary","I am not a Hilary hater! I think she has talent in some things, but definatly not singing. Hollywood needs to know when to stop, enough is enough! The songs on this CD are good, but everytime any song involving Hilary comes up, I just can't help but turn off my CD player. If you listen closely Hilary is singing about 10% of the songs she is in and the other 90% is editing and other musicians who do HAVE THE TALENT in this matter. Hilary should stick to the things she was meant to do, which I am afraid involve only acting and looking sassy."
5,The best CD ever!,"I love this CD. Track one is Why Not, My fave song, two, Tide is high by Atomic Kitten, My fave band, three, all around the world, perfect music for cartwheels, ten, What dreams are made of, and Why not remix number 14. I love this soundtrack and everyone at my school has it. I watch the show, and seen the movie. Lizzie McGuire rocks my world!..."
1,No where,Hilary Duff will not be the next female vocalist of the year. She can't sing! If you listen closely that isn't her real voice!! Let's get Hilary at a performance where she has to sing live and without the help of any computers and such to help her voice. I can't believe people would purchase this cd. The songs are horribly disgusting! Listen to them! They are so so teeny bopperish. And I'm not talking like NSYNC teeny bopper. This is way worse. Her acting in the movie was horrible as well. She needs to go back to school and continue with her life. Either that or stick to TV shows because the movies are too much for her.
3,List of songs are reviews,"It will either be: good, bad, okay.1. WHY NOT: Eh. Okay. The first time you hear it its okay but it gets annoying faster then you can say ""Duff""2. THE TIDE IS HIGH: GOOD! GREAT! BEST SONG!3. ALL AROUND THE WORLD: ...BAD BAD BAD!! WORST SONG!4. WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF (PALO AND ISABELLA VERSION): EW! Bad. Bad. Bad.5. SHINING STAR: Okay...just okay.6. VOLORE: Okay....just okay. (again)7. OPEN YOUR EYES TO LOVE: Ditto...8. YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A STAR: GOOD! I like this song!9. SUPERMODEL: EW.10. WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF (LIZZIE ADDITION): BAD!11. ON AN EVENING IN ROMA: EW....thing song is old.12. GIRL IN THE BAND: Haylie Duff (Hilary's sister) is a good singer. Id like to see more of her. Good song.13. ORCHESTRAL SUIE: BORING.14. WHY NOT (MCMIX): It's okay."
4,Cool cd,"This cd is pretty cool. I liked the songs that Hilary Duff sang. It says that there are 2 songs that aren't in the movie that are on there, but they are all in there somewhere. You will like this cd if you are a Lizzie McGuire fan. My favorite songs are ""You Make Me Feel Like a Star"" and ""What Dreams Are Made Of"". I would reccomend it!"
1,A forgettable [weak] soundtrack !,"Hey, man is this CD ever so cool ~ ...This CD has a definite target audience of pre-high school tweens.If you're a parent wanting to disctract the children for a few minutes then by all means purchase this package ... but if you are a TRUE music collector and hope to mount a serious collection, I strongly suggest that you pass on this item...."
1,what to say?,i work as a nanny and let my charges pick the car music when we drive around. the 11 and 9 year-old girls i babysit for bought this cd and even they hate it...an unoriginal and overproduced collection of artists singing unoriginal and overproduced songs. hilary duff has perhaps the worst voice of anyone in the music industry. spare yourselves and buy some real music.
3,Thnx 2 da girl who said dat hilary wuz a brat-ur right.,"I hate hilary isn't it unbelievable she USES COMPUTERS?????? If she couldn't sing without them, why'd she even become 1? o yeah. she thinks she can do anything since she's already famous. she's definately a brat. But the other people are OK. At least they don't use computers. U hilary fans if NE1 eva asks u if u like N E fake singers, u can say, i like hilry. then they'll say, oh, that bratty guy."
4,Good Job Hilary,"I thought this was a great soundtrack, perfect for the movie.Some of the songs are a bit too boppy but overall if you like Hilary Duff and pop it's a great c.d. Of all the songs, my least favorite was the one sung by Haylie Duff- Girl In the Band-it was pretty lame,so was All Around The World by Cooler Kids, that song just repeats the same two lines over and over again. The best one, I thought,was by Hilary- What Dreams Are Made Of-very cute, not bad for a newcomer."
3,Hilary,"First off, I am not a Hilary hater. I believe she is a good actress. So too put it in logical terms, she should remain in the acting business. A soundtrack like this is decent. It is too bubble-gummy, and it is great for young pre-teens. But overall, the movie was good, but the soundtrack is too overrated."
4,Supermodel is Awesome,"I own the lizzie mcguire soundtrack album and i really like it my favourite track on the album has to be supermodel by far. I love that song! unfortunately it has that Barbie feel to it i think when she sings 'cindy i can feel it, gladia work that runway sweetie and so on. but i just listened to the original version 'supermodel of the world' and im happy to say that the taylor Dayne version is much better! I am also a fan of Hilary Duff herself."
1,What is this stuff?,"As another reviewer said...This is music? ""Ear-candy"" or ""bubblegum pop"", yes...because it sounds good and sugary-sweet but is bad for you. indeed, it's easy to listen to...too easy. and too computerized. Anyone who is going to buy this CD should at least listen to Charlotte Church or Billy Gillman first...people who have TALENT. Not a computerized voice that is electronically ""enhanced"" to make sure that it sounds like the girl can carry a tune.Notice that the ""ballad version"" of the song is NOT sung by Hilary Duff...it's by a mysterious ""Isabella"" who you might assume is Duff, but it obviously isn't from the good quality of the voice...someone's obviously trying to trick people into thinking that the girl can sing."
3,It was ok.,"The movie was pretty predictable, and a one time watch. Ecept for when Lizzy goes on stage. I prefer the series to the movie."
5,IT'S ALL ABOUT ATOMIC KITTEN!!,"The only reason I bought this soundtrack was to hear Atomic Kitten's ""The Tide Is High"", which is by fay the best song. The other songs are a bit too childish for me. Also, this soundtrack is not all about Hilary Duff. The girl can barely sing and her songs are a bit immature. ANyway, I strongly recommend checking out Atomic Kitten because they are great!oh, and yes, ""The Tide Is High"" is the song at the beginning that goes ""Im not the kinda girl, who gives up just like that waooooo""."
4,bob rules,"Definitely buy this album, listen to it enough that you change favorite songs a few times, and go to see him live when at all possible. You would not believe how good his band is live--especially the horns (he often travels without them, and the experience is not quite as good when this is the case)! He should be BIG, but his seemingly careless attitude toward fame is one of the big attractions of his music."
4,surprise favorite,"I'd never heard of this guy, but I got this CD free and played it out of curiosity. now I can't stop listening to it. I love how varied it is, and how versatile the artist seems to be. recommended."
4,Austin's Biggest Kept Secret,"I first got introduced to Bob Schneider's music about a year ago. A few of the songs like ""Big Blue Sea"" and ""Metal and Steel"" were frequently played on the radio. These got me interested in hearing the rest of the album and I've never looked back since. This album is the real deal showcasing Bob Schneider's varied musical talents with catchy lyrics and sincere emotion. Everyone will find something to like, probably to love, about Lonelyland. ""Tokyo"" speaks to the frustrated, twisted way we all feel amid personal crisis (this is where the explicit lyrics come in) while ""The World Exploded into Love"" takes us to a higher level of awareness with it's intensity. Having seen Bob perform live, I can honestly say he's put his heart into this CD, just like he does on stage, and it clearly shows. Since nothing's perfect, I can't give this CD a 5, but it's the closest I've seen in a long while. Austin's got yet another reason to be proud."
5,Great Texas Music,"I have been a fan and follower of Bob Schneiders music since I moved to Austin, Texas in 1992. He writes songs that are fun to listen to as well as appreciate. His writing style is so diverse that it almost sounds as if you've changed your CD from one artist to another while listening to his work. If you are a fan of music written because the perosn behind the lyrics loves what he does then buy this CD and wear it out. And if you are lucky enough to see his show live, do so. What he holds back on the CD he releases ten-fold in person. Bob, keep up the good work!!! A fan from Texas stuck in California"
2,Ugh,"A ""friend"" told me about this ""album"" because he thought it might mesh well with my musical tastes. I've been a fan of singer/songwriters like Lucinda Williams, Townes Van Zandt, and Jay Farrar for years. And as they and their confederates in ""alterna-country"", ""insurgent country"", ""The Austin Sound"" (or whatever other pretentious label culled from the review pages of Rolling Stone makes you feel special) have become more popular with people like you and me who just like good music, there has been a rise in the number of ego-driven coolies who have taken over Nashville and, now it seems, Austin.This guy is the rule, not the exception.If Billy Ray Cyrus had a selection of distortion pedals, a thesaurus, and started thinking that he had something profound to say about the human condition, this is the album he would have put out. In lieu of that, we have Bob Schneider.Ugh."
2,Maybe not for everyone?,"I read about BS in La Vie magazine. I was so excited when I found this CD at the Uni Prix after locating my favorite cheese. I know that this guy is from Texas. I enjoy at least one other recording from a pop group who reside in Austin. My favorite singer is Serge Gainsbourg. He has songs also with risque words. I wanted to like this Bob Schneider. The songs are ok, but they remind me of the play toys of my little dog, Jean Pierre. When you squeeze them they make a sound and you are amused. Before you know it, they are under the chair and your puppy is bored and looking for something more fun to play with."
3,GREAT AUSTIN ARTIST,"I was lucky enough to get ahold of a promotional cd the end of last year and have been fasinated with this award winning artist ever since. I even bought The Scab's CD and one of his earlyer ones. I also went to see him and he is awsome. From the first chord of Big Blue Sea, I was hooked. A lot of it is however an aquired taste. Big Blue Sea and Metal and Steel being two major exceptions. These songs hook you instantly. The only reason that I gave it only 3 stars is that I never give anything over 4 because no cd (in my opinion) is perfect (although after a few listens this one comes close) and since some songs have to grow on you I choose 3. A lot are more mellow like 2002 but after 3 listens I ashure you will love these as well. It's totally worth it!!!!"
5,Classic,"You gotta Love Bob Schneider. Being in the TX area, I learned of Bob a while back and have seen him many times. This album is classic and is what got him noticed. He can master a variety of styles, jazzy, funky, americana, plain old rock etc...This is an excellent album. Highy Recommend it."
4,Newly Bobbed,"After seeing Bob Schneider's fantastic performance on Austin City Limits, I tracked him down. I am now a big fan--you just can't help it! Lonelyland is a great listening album. Check him out with The Ugly Americans and Mitch Watkins. You just gotta get on your feet. From ""Big Blue Sea"" to ""I am Batman,"" Bob rocks."
1,"Not the correct CD, advertised as the Limited Edition","I already owned ""Lonelyland"", but found a used copy online that appeared to be the Limited Edition cd that had the song ""King of the World"" on it. When it arrived I was disappointed to find that it is the same regular version that I already owned. I guess i should have inquired instead of just ordering based on the album song listing that I read online."
5,Top Cast,"Not since Dire Straights, Bruce Springstien or the Stones first broke loose, have I found music that has turned me like Lonelyland. It is a unique sound, blended form so many influences and guitar that betters Clapton at his best. You want to start listening to one of the big names of the future.. then listen to this. Schnieder.. will follow the example of Dido and explode internationally. Can't wait for the next album."
4,Finally Everyone Can Know,"That Bob Schneider can rock, roll rap and cradle you all on one cd ! He is one of the least recognized musicians around! I mean in Texas we recognize him but it's time he burns up the radio with a catchy infectious song like ""Metal and Steal"". ""Big Blue Sea"" is great when your mellow and loving the world and no one can hear ""2002"" and not relate on some level. And when your ready to party put on ""Bullets"" and everyone will join in the chorus, lift their beers and dance right there in your apartment. I have seen this artist live almost 300 times over the last ten years. This Cd is wonderful but live is truly a unique experience! Check him out if he comes to your town. We all complain about the cheesy music of the bubble gum pop stars! Only you can help make radio better! Buy this CD! Start a trend don't follow one!"
4,"EXCELLENT, VARIED SHOWCASE FROM BOB","I got hooked on Bob Schneider at Antone's and my ears haven't been the same since. Very, very talented musician/songwriter who hasn't sold out desipte being on the verge of emerging into a pop-culture breakout artist. Will you love EVERY single track on this CD? Maybe, maybe not, but you will not be disappointed. I listen to everything from Massive Attack and Garbage to Robert Earl Keen to SRV to....you name it. Point is that if the ""eject"" button broke on my CD player, Lonelyland is the CD that I would want to be listening to. In my years of being a music lover I have come to realize that some people/bands are great musicians and terrible songwriters (Aerosmith ROCKS but not too deep), while others are the opposite (Willie Nelson anyone?). I think Schneider's appeal is that he fulfills both roles in a big way. Enjoy!"
5,Outstanding,"Laura and Janis have been there, done it, and not without the struggle and strife that allows them to be real. The book is incredibly huge, tough for a mom of a 1 and 2 year old. Yet each page is full of wisdom, humor, reassurance, and some good old-fashioned know-how. Also, while Laura doesn't disclose in this book that she experienced abuse as a child, she has in her other works. I say this to say, she's overcome very real hardships and struggles to give us real words."
4,"Great for toddlers and preschoolers, a bit off for babies","As everyone so far has written, this is a wonderful, empathetic book. It includes a wealth of information, in a depth rarely found in popular parenting books. As a single mom, I appreciated that the authors do not assume that everyone has the ""ideal"" two-parent middle class WASP family. However, although the book's subtitle says that it is for the first five years, I find some of its advice on infant care questionable. They think it is okay to let your baby cry to learn independence, if it agrees with the parents' values. They also wrongly claim that ""...some children never lose interest in nursing..."" and advocate adult-led weaning. Buy this book for helpful information about your toddler and preschooler, but for babies, see the books by Martha and William Sears (The Baby Book, Parenting the Fussy Baby and High Need Child, The Discipline Book) for a more sensitive approach."
5,Very good book!!!,"I have read a lot of parenting books and I really love this one. It talks about children's feelings and also the feelings of adults. This book is not just about raising your children, but also raising yourself. She talks about the way society sees things and how we shouldn't worry what society thinks. It also talks about the way we were taught by our own parents and how that can come out with your own children. It shows that feelings of sadness, anger, embarrassment are all natural and we need to let our children know that, but to teach them to express those feelings in good ways. I think this book is a must read for any parent. We need to view our children like they are.....little people with feelings. They are not our property. We are here to guide them and to teach them."
5,A Great Gift,"This is a book that I like to give to parents who's parenting philosophy differs significantly from my own or to brand-spankin-new-doesn't-have-a-clue parents. It doesn't define the best way to do things, but helps parent's define their own style based on their own beliefs. This book is not about dogma, it's about *your* family.This would make a great gift early in pregnancy too when mom's are highly motivated and have free time to explore ideas. Along with the AAP Birth to 5 Years reference, you've got a complete early parenting library. If I could, I'd give these two books to every new parent I know.Appropriate for any family configuration including single parents, full-time grandparents (who may need a refresher course), and adoptive parents."
2,Not my cup of tea,"I do not recommend this book. While parts of the book are good, for example about fights with sibilings. Other parts are just plain off, for example the section on discipline. Just keep in mind that this book is one person's opinion on the subject. I felt that this person had a one sided agenda that they wanted to get across instead of a balance view of parenting."
3,great but,"These looked industrial grade but in actuality there are a couple things which I was disappointed about. The pad under the nose section came off on every single one I used (3 in all). The pad would dangle in front of my eyes which was really annoying. The straps are attached in the same cheap way as all the other masks, with a staple. You have to really baby these masks or the strap will break. The comfort and ease of breathing was very good however."
2,pictures are not real.,"what do you see here ?RED MUG.i got PINK MUG:but anyway, i bought because i need the word ( Big Hug )but i'm not sure if i would buy anything from the same store. i will wait for a customer to upload his/her own photos"
3,diaper,very comphy to wear very thik and soft . but they dont havee elastic in the front and only 2 taps on each side they fix that there great.
3,"MY mom, felt like she was wearing a diaper.!","I bought this product for my 75 yr old mother. I had her try this, due to the outstanding reviews. My mom, was not pleased: she felt humiliated and said it looked and felt like a diaper. I went back to the garment briefs that feel and look like underwear. They are comfortable and absorbent and less than a third of the price. A package of 90 for $30.00 and includes shipping at Sam's. Hope this helps some of you to decide."
4,Need More Tips,"I liked the kit for a started piece. The rubber was large enough to make (re: attempt to make) a few stamps. One worked out alright of the four I attempted. Issue I had were the nibs, there was a small and a medium, I would have rather had a fine tip and the medium or gouge tool for the dead space around my designs. Over all though it was okay."
1,Disappointed with Toys R Us,"My son received this Megazord for Christmas. I thought this was ""the megazord"" advertised at Toy R Us as the one that transforms into the command center. After explaining what I looking for to a very nice sales person, he brought it down from the top shelf for me. It was the only Megazord in the toy section of this size and I thought that it was the one advertised. Wrong. Except I did not find out I was wrong until Christmas day when this hard piece of non-transforming plastic had been ripped out of its box by my very excited 5 year old. He was disappointed to say the least when he discovered that it wouldn't transform. But... he wouldn't let it go back to Toys R Us since there is not a transforming one to replace it!!! He wanted a megazord so badly that he is keeping it to look at it! I wonder how many others are out there like us, who were also dupped, and are keeping it just because the one that they really wanted is not yet available? Shame on Toys R Us."
2,A Robot & A Big Gun,"When we bought this toy for our 6-year-old we thought it was a shape-shifting robot toy. That it is, but one of the shapes it shifts into is that of a big gun of the size and configuration for the child to hold and play with. If you don't want your kids playing with toy guns, get a different toy."
2,Overrated,"Wow. This is one the most overrated books in history. If you are CS student, prepare for your doom! Everytime I tried to read a page, I look back and wonder ""What did I just read?"" One will need an EE background just to begin to comprehend the stuff in this book. The examples were so bad that I would have to look online just to see a good example. The author presents the material in such a boring format that I wanted to go to sleep everytime I read a page."
4,Buy this book...,Highly informative text with detailed illustrations. A necessity if you are deciding to take an introductory Digital Design/Logic course.
1,completely useless book,"This book really sucks at teaching you anything. When I do the homework, I spend most of my time google just to find out how to do something. When I find it on google i completely understand what to do. I look it up in the book and there like 5 pages on the subject which I have no idea what he is talking about and does not help in doing the homework."
3,I'ts just OK,A friend recommended this game because we're scrabblefans so I got it. They have improved upon the game sincethis one was published and the newer one which Ipurchased has a better format.
5,This is PERFECT for beginners!,"My wife and I both have recently started working out and this DVD is perfect for it. I knew some things about weights, but she knew nothing. Well, she does now! :) These two instructors, Phil and Julie, are perfect to get things going. They are so friendly in their approach it makes you want to learn. You won't go wrong with this one."
4,Great beginner product,This is a very good dvd for learning the proper use of weights for fitness training. Easy step by step instructions though the audio was recorded lower than normal and volume needs to be raised higher. I would recommend this dvd.
5,Pat is back!,"Pat is back and better than ever. From the opening song (the title track ""GO"") it is clear that Pat has returned to the signature rock that made her famous with an updated sound that should appeal to fans of modern rock. Neil's guitar work is some of his best, and of course the vocals on both the rockers and the ballads demonstrate Pat's range. A must own for fans!"
1,What a Disappointment!,"I love Pat Benatar! But this album is just pathetic- - -I never thought I'd be sorry to spend money on anything she does, but this is soooo poor. Trying to be a punky late 90s-2000 rock chick. Give up the sound of the new millenium- - - it doesn't suit your voice at all. And all the rhythms are similar. I am so disappointed! And what's up with the makeup???!!!Any other of her albums are so much better. Pass this one up and buy Annie Lennox's ""Bare"" instead."
2,average at best,Pat Benatar use to have a edge about her but you gotta go back 20 years to fully appreciate what she brought out in her music.these songs for the most part feel half baked&lack the kind of edge that Pat Benatar sparked back in the day.Her voice is still there but the music comes up short overall.
2,Dont Go buy this,"I ham a die hard Pat fan since day one....The music was getting progressivly better in the late 80's..I love Le Bel age, One Love..songs that seem to reflect Pat and Neil's life...since they've been married for so long I hope they are happy...the songs on the new Cd are full of bitterness, hopefully not Pat and Neil's life experience at the moment. I wish them both success..I wish alll the fans some new colaborations..with other rock artists...and new writers..Or maybe they should write about love,,??"
2,Go Bananas instead!,"I just bought GO along with Deep Purple's latest album, Bananas (import) and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience.Two of my favorite artists seem to be going in different directions and I'm not talking musical. I can't believe how boring GO is, the playing lacks spark and the songs simply aren't good or memorable. The arrangements are typical modern smoke and mirrors studio work and Pat just don't sound like she's having fun! When the disc ended I knew I wouldn't be in a hurry to play it again any time soon.Conversely, Deep Purple's Bananas is everything GO isn't. Great songs, unbelievable performances and the band sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the running order of the album is just outstanding. I've played Bananas 10 times as much as Pat's latest.It's safe to say this is not Pat's finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple's.GO: 2 starsBANANAS: 5 stars"
4,Play it LOUD!,"I knew from first look at the cover artwork that this was going to be one high voltage, kick-[butt] CD. I remember buying my first PB album back in 1979, and with one listen of ""GO"", I felt transported back to my high school days with memories of such classics as ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""Crimes of Passion."" This CD has everything a Pat Benatar fan could ask for. Electrifyingly driven by Spyder, Pat soars on the soon to be classics ""Go"" and ""Girl."" My favorite track, as I write, ""In my Dreams."" This is one haunting tune, I love it! I saw Pat and Neil on their Summer Vacation Tour and was fortunate enough to hear a few of the new tunes earlier this year. If you haven't got the ""Summer Tour"" DVD, buy it now!"
5,PAT'S BAAAAAAAAACK!,"And she ROCKS! The 6 year wait since her last studio album has been well worth the wait. 11 new songs and, as a hidden bonus, ""Christmas In America"" unlisted as track #15 (3 quickee blanks in between 11 and 15). A nice mix of mid-tempo numbers (ala ""Innamorata""), a couple of softer ""ballad-y"" songs, and some rockers with nice crunchy guitar riffs. And as usual, her voice is in top-notch form.Some of these songs will be familiar to anyone who's seen Pat on tour over the past couple of summers. ""I Won't"", ""Girl"" and ""Out Of The Ruins"" have been part of those shows and they sound even better here. I think my favorite song at the moment is the title track. It's got a great metal feel to it (especially the guitars) and Mrs Giraldo's vocals are slinging more attitude than they have since ""You Better Run"". Way cool.The only downside? Some scary makeup artistry in the cover art. I'll deal.Highly recommended, well worth the money for any fan."
3,BEAUTIFUL INCREDIBLE VOICE TOTALLY OVERPRODUCED CD,"I am a HUGE Pat Benatar fan and I love this CD. BUT it is really overproduced. PAT seriously needs to work with some outside producers if she did ever seriously want a come back. Neil is a great guitar plaer, but producer...it ain't workin', her voice is still so AMAZING she deserved somethign better and a HUGE comeback. Also, why on earth they released HAVE IT ALL as a single is beyond me, GO was the obvious single, but just as the last CD they release the oddest song that no one will play. I LOVE PAT BENATAR and her music and this CD is good, but it has so many different styles on it , it makes no sense, she needs a REAL producer for her amazing abilities"
4,She still Rocks!,"The new CD titled ""GO"" will take you right back to 1980 and all the things you love about Benatar's powerful voice and her husbands raging guitar. My kids are embarassed about how hard it makes their Mom rock out! I just can't help myself!"
4,GO -- AND GET THIS GREAT COMEBACK CD!,"Wow! I really looked forward to this CD but I didn't dare to even hope that it would be THIS GOOD! The first song -- GO -- also the name of the title, starts off like many old Benatar songs... hard rockin' and hot! Other noteworthy songs are I WON'T and SORRY... I love part of the lyrics to HAVE IT ALL... ""You think you're the second coming, Sorry to say it doesn't do it for me."" Ha ha sounds like some people I know! While it is about half hard rockin' and half ballads, there is NOT a bad song on this entire album. I like the fact that Pat's Christmas Song -- Christmas in America -- is included even though it was not listed on the insert. GO PAT AND NEIL! KEEP 'EM COMING AND ROCK ON! (However, wouldn't it be AWESOME if someday Pat did an entire opera CD!)"
4,"Watch out people,, she's back!","Well after all this time, I have been waiting for this release from Pat Benatar, and finally here it is, Neil and Pat are one,, and they can still put out the best music ever.A definite must for anyone that is a Pat Benatar fan."
3,Could be better,"First the positive...Love Pat Benatar's voice and always have...she sounds great as always...But on first listen through my initial impression was ""noise""... Nothing new, nothing fresh, just noise. After a few listens it starts to grow on you, but nothing like innamorata which I thought was great. Maybe a colaboration with a good song writer, and a band like Nickelback would help...My best advise for Pat, if she ever wants to get back to her 80's fame would be to try something new and daring."
4,Pat is back!,"Pat is back and it was worth the wait for us die hard fans. The last studio album that came out, 1997's ""Innamorata"" was a bit of a disappointment. It was too acoustic and mellow for my liking. But with this new cd she totally does what she does best, rock! Her voice sounds better than ever and the new songs are very fresh. Check out ""Brave"", ""Have It All"" and the catchy ""Girl"" which could be a great single."
4,Your princess will love this!!!!!,This purse come with all the things your princess will need to head to the ball. It is a great buy and will keep your princess entertained. My daughter plays with hers everyday. It makes her feel like she is a real princess.
5,Fun that lasts!!!,Both my girls enjoy their little purses with everything inside. The sunglasses get a lot of use. A great buy!!
5,Lens quality is surprisingly high.,"I was shocked to find that this *little* lens has better optical quality than the ~4 others I tried, most of which were 2-3X its size. It's great for taking that narrow FOV (60 degrees) of most cell phones up to around 90. Most of the other lenses I tried were *really* bad, so relative to them, this thing is hands-down 5 stars."
4,gold lame',"I agree with the Le Tigre comparison, but not so much with the Peaches one. But, Electrocute IS on tour with Peaches, and if you miss it you'll be sorry! Buy this CD if you like Ladytron, Tracy and the Plastics, Le Tigre, and of course, Peaches. Hell, they're from Germany, too."
4,does the job,Wish it amplified the voice a little more but it is still a cool inexpensive toy. I keep one in the car and pack it in my son's suitcase when he is spending the night with relatives.
1,Waste of Money,"First, as an adult i had trouble holding it in one hand. It did not really amplify, more fun could be had by a child talking thru the end of a empty paper towel tube!"
3,It's OK,"The microphone did exactly what the advertisement stated. It created an echo effect and does not require batteries. Unfortunately, even though I knew this fact, it was still very ""underwhelming."" I don't think my 2 year old toddler played with it 30 seconds. My advise is that your child will either love it or not. Just ask yourself...""is the price cheap enough to roll the dice on this one?"""
1,Does not fit the phone correctly,"If this is the only case you can find for the LG8700 it will work in a pinch, but it really is too generic to fit the phone with the standard battery. If you add the extented battery is stays in the pouch better."
5,Ayahuasca Visions,"The best of the best. If you ever wanted to know what it ""looks"" like to take a real ""trip"" on the DMT Queen of the jungle. The visual imagery is very much like the real thing, only a little clearer. It is sort of a best of the trips synopsis without all the trouble of getting down to South America. And even better, in my opinion, is Edwardo Luna's commentary on what these visions may mean in both a cultural and scientific context. He is of course an anthropologist who has taken many trips to try and understand them. Highly recommended for anyone thinking about learning more either with or without entheogens."
5,Pictures and Stories,"Well printed, nicely written and interesting with a forward describing his life-- Castaneda is nothing comparing what has happened to this man and it's for real. Buy it, you wont regret!"
1,What a joke...,"The storyline was not researched, the acting was that of a kindergarden play with the dialogue of a poorly run house of corrections, however the 9 year old operating the camera did quite an impressive job for his age. My favorite part was when the 'senior year college students' were doing their reseach on camera as if to tell the audience: Look, we CAN read. Don't waste your time."
1,very bad,"well as you might have guessed, there are several fake reviews here from cast and crew trying to make this movie look good. sadly, this is a common trend on amazon for crappy movies (check the reviews for haunted changi and bake street hauntings for some hilarious fake reviews). anyways, this movie was pretty awful. for starters, it looks like it was filmed entirely on a cell phone... its below flip mino quality. the acting is bad. i guess the scenes exploring ""the ridges"" were kinda creepy but everything else in this movie was horrible. avoid"
1,The Ridges,"This was the worst documentary we've ever watched. It was so amature and fake, we just rolled our eyes the entire movie. Don't waste your money."
1,This was free on IMDB,"Now it's ""private"" and the author of the FAQ is putting links to the Amazon page on other movies on IMDB claiming either he finds it enjoyable and well done, or he wants to get it banned because of the ""real"" footage and ""yuck"" join him in standing against it.In any case, asking $19.99 for an unreleased burn-on-demand movie from an unknown director is a bit much, and insinuating (falsely) that there is real footage of dead kids to get people to buy it is just sad."
2,Avoid,"Seriously? Forever Young and Turn The Beat Around. Both on Disc 2. The rest is ear noise,cd filler, bad dj fodder.... get the pic?"
2,Great if used properly User Beware- can cause blindness,"This bulb is awesome - if you are not using it as an only light source. Meaning, you need to have daylight as well.This bulb (and other compact bulbs) can cause what we call ""snow blindness"".If you notice your lizard not opening his/her eyes, trying to get away from the bulb or squinting, etc -please stop using immediately.We use this on our Sulcata tortoise ONLY when she gets light from the window as well and when not in her night habitat so that she can get away from this light source if need be."
5,great light for box turtle,"I adopted a 25 yr old 3-toed box turtle in July. She had spent her life indoors without a UVB lightsource and was very sedentary, suffering from mild MBD. She now lives in a 3-season outdoor habitat but we brought her in for the winter and set her up with this light.. what an improvement! She is noticeably more active and has a better appetite since I installed this over her terrarium.. in only a few short months she has even started to develop colorful spots on her face like the outdoor kept boxies I have seen. I leave it on about 4-5hrs a day during the brightest hours in the natural light of the windows near her.Obviously outdoors is best, but I definitely recommend this bulb for turtles who are wintering indoors like Sonny."
2,Works Great when It Works!,"Purchased 6/28/12, installed 6/29/12. Set up on a timer to be on 8 hours per day. Today is 8/18 and the bulb is dead. Grrrrr. For $25.00 It would be nice if it lasted a bit longer."
1,Do not purchase this product!,"I purchased 2 of these in less than a week 1 from amazon that died 1 day later, 1 from the pet store that died 3 days later. What a piece of rubbish!!! When I have an alternative I will up date this post."
1,Don't buy this bulb...,"This worked great for 2 and 1/2 months, and then it stopped producing UVB (It was supposed to work for 12 months) and my Dragon stopped eating and pooping. Research the MegaRay or the T-Rex mercury Vapor bulb for a professional set up. I went online, and others are having the same issues."
4,my tortoise loves it...but...,"I like the design of this lamp, I've replaced an older spotlight type UV lamp with this one and appreciate that it is smaller, uses less electricity, and produces less heat. However, I've aware that this lamp will stop producing UV at some point but I have no idea when. I may buy a UV tester, which is very expensive, so perhaps some sort of indicator could be built into these things to let us know when they are no longer producing UV.My tortoise took right to it and loves sitting under it."
3,Brains...,"If you like to read about the unfortunate accidents that occur daily without our knowledge, pick up this book and find out what gets done to remedy some of those grimm situations. The in depth description and multiple examples given of the use of hypothermic arrest for repairing deep brain aneurysms put you right in the operating room. A few grammatical errors and an unessesary Arizona history lesson bog the main body and, at times, the author seems to jump around but, all in all, a good read. I learned a few things and the detailed written description of where certain structures in the brain are located created a vivid mental picture of the severity of head injuries that occur in the greater Phoenix area."
3,Wish I could give a better rating,"Someone in another review said that the examples dont work. I cant tell, because I cant even get them to download from the web site. There is a detailed errata, which is a good thing, and the book's content is wonderful. It's always the little things that get you marked down, I guess."
1,not that great,This book doesn't really show me anything new that I didn't already know. Most everything in the book has already been done in other books.
1,Examples don't work,"Sample code provided in this book does not work. For example on page 65 sample, there are sooooo many problems in the code that it took me more than half an hour to get it to work. There is a typo at the top, in the directive there is a parameter used which is not supposed to be there, and it is missing a parameter. AND ... This is just on the first two lines of code! The datareader is missing, and the list goes on ... I hate picking a book which is filled with so many errors. I would not recommand it!"
4,"It helped me, but no c# code","This is not a beginner's guide it is a book full of examples. I was able to use the examples in the book to build what I needed. I just started with ASP .NET and don't really have the concepts down yet. This book offered some examples that allowed me to better understand the concepts while giving me code that works (meaning I didn't have go figure out how to apply the concepts to write the code).I'm writing in C# and sometimes the VB code is a little confusing, but this book saved me."
3,The show is a little slow,"I have seen her in person and on several stand up tv shows, Comic View, First Amendment Comedy, Laffa Palooza, and Def Comedy. She has been around for a while and I think she may be finally breaking out. I saw her on a Valentines day show a few years ago where she opened for Katt Williams. She was hilarious!!! (and kinda stole a little of Katts thunder) And man when she went out in the audience to talk to people she was on it. Do ya?? Do ya?? Do Ya??? Well Do Ya?? (if you have seen her show you know what I am talking about) She does some of this here near the end and it is funny but prior to that it seems the show took a while for her to get really going. It is funny but not to die for."
5,Prepare to Laugh your Azz OFF,"The video was hilarious. I saw Leslie live with Katt Williams. She stole the show. I have been waiting for her to come out with something. I was so excited to purchase. Yes it was worth the wait. A little raw, a lot of adult content. But Very funny!!!"
2,This could make you hate this opera,"There is a lot of good intent in this recording but it just doesn't come together. Bonynge's tempi are sluggish and his inclusion of the Paris ballet music exposes the listener to one of Verdi's most atrocious pieces of music - no wonder no other conductor included it. Sutherland, while still in her estimable prime, here sounds hooty and tired. Pavarotti sounds workaday - his adoption of heavy roles like Manrico was beginning to wear away at his voice. Marilyn Horne is totally miscast as Azucena - a heavy-handed, matronly personification. Ingvar Wixell sings Di Luna's music but little else.There were so many other (bel canto)works in which this trio could have shone but Verdi's masterpiece is not for them. There are many fine recordings of this work which demonstrate how gripping and lyrical this piece is. Avoid this one!"
5,Great Product,Arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition! GREAT price! Would most definitely purchase again.
4,A Good Collectible,"Having read only the original Dune, I was unaware of what was going to happen in this follow-up to the earlier series of Dune. It was reasonably easy to follow however, and I really enjoyed it. The ending left me wanting more. It was harder to emphathize with the main characters and I was somewhat less concerned about what happened to them. On balance though, I look forward to seeing it again."
4,Okay spin on the second two books.,"Dated special effects, decent acting. Follows books fairly close. Only really for Dune fans. If you are a Dune fan then you will probably like it."
4,This movie weaves a rich tapestry of scifi fantasy.,"I saw it on the scifi channel and was extremely impessed by it. The music is extremely good and the effects are first rate. To people not familiar at all with the lore of Dune it may seem confusing at first, but they should catch on. Quite a show!"
2,Read the book,"I bought this DVD recently, after a 20-year lapse since I last read the Dune books. With only a vague memory of what was supposed to be going on, the movie was pretty much incomprehensible.What was the reason for Leto II transforming himself into a sandworm? I don't remember, and the movie didn't explain. Somehow, this was supposed to be the next evolutionary step, or some such thing, but why? And why did Leto seem so confident and at peace with his decision, when later we find out that he sobbed in his sister's lap and asked her to help him die?A lot of the acting is truly dreadful, and seems more appropriate to a stage play than a movie. Many of the costumes look like they came from old the original Star Trek series. And many of the sets were obviously just that ... sets with painted backgrounds.As with the other adaptations of Dune books, too much had to be left out in the interest of time, and if you aren't very familiar with the story, you can easily be left scratching your head."
3,Amusingly addictive ...,"I don't know what it is about this series, but I like it, even though I was prepared to dislike it based on the first Dune series (which contained laughable costumes and boring conversations). And so that you know where I'm coming from, my standard for costume, locations and actors is the movie directed by David Lynch.Some reasons why I like it are: Alia with her wide eyes and strong nose, the pathetic Princess Irulan, women who are in positions of power, Leto with his presence, the sad music, the decent costumes, and the better acting overall.Some reasons why I dislike it are: the fake outdoor shots, the wedding costume of Prince Faydeen (?), and Alice Krige as Jessica who looks too delicate."
2,"Dune: Save your coins, buy another DVD","I'm a Herbert ""Dune"" series fan. If you haven't read the novels the mini-series is based on don't even attempt to follow the story line, it won't make sense. It was hard for this fan to follow. The mini-series is very much a soap opera and not the intricate story the book is. But to give the devil his due, the films SFX's are great, costuming, etc. is also good. I'm not sure Dune can be successfully made into a movie because so much takes place in people's heads. So I suggest use the money and buy the books if you've not read them. You'll be much happier."
4,Great!,"I loved this. I never much liked the second or third books when I first read them. I only liked the first and fourth. However, after watching this miniseries, I like them much better. The acting was great, they got the characterization spot on, and the more confusing aspects of the books were explained very well. They made one understand Irulan a lot better. I really liked her in the movies. One could also feel more for Alia."
5,Wonderfully done,"The two books these are based on are confusing and muddled. This DVD brings them to wonderful life, with amazing acting all around. The special effects are better than Sci-Fi's previous Dune effort. Highly, highly recommended, especially if you didn't like the books."
4,Far better than any of the movies based on Dune.,the mini-series did a much better job of character development than the movie versions. And it tried much harder to remain faithful to the book(s).
5,loved it!,"I am not a Dune devotee, or at least I wasn't before i saw this miniseries! Now I have delved deep into reading Frank Herbert's masterpiece, and I must say that the miniseries certainly lives up to it's name. I think that Daniela Amavia and Alica Krige were the shining stars, and the other devoted actors and actresses also shone brightly. Of course, the talent was characteristically snubbed by the Emmys this year, the miniseries only going up for a couple of technical awards, but that just strengthens my belief that this project is one to remember! Definitely worth buying!"
1,Inexplicably high rating,"Laughable costumes, god-awful acting (even from 'the names'), terrible special effects. I'm embarrassed to have seen it. How this travesty ended up with a 4.5star review is beyond me. Avoid."
5,Children of Dune,Frank Herbert's Dune is a glorious story that I read over twenty years ago. I love this movie because it follows just what it's in the book. I only wish that it was in high definition. I can't wait for it to come out in high definition. I hope Amazon will have avaiable soon.
4,Great series,"Great series, wish they would continue the saga. Have a feeling young Professor X would be a bit out of the price range now though."
5,A new Dune's fan!,"Oh my, I LOVE THIS MOVIE and i'm not a science friction fan. my husband thinks i'm obessed abd crazy, but i looooooooooved this movie when premiered on SCIFI channel. The cast, the music....can't say enough about it. I am buying the original DUNE and this one on DVD"
4,Surprising..,"I liked this movie.. and yet I don't know why! Once I had watched the whole thing twice I didn't know how to feel. Happy because the ""evil"" people were punished or depressed because the ""heroes"" died or were left unhappy/doomed. This is the kind of movie that you either like it or you don't."
1,the second is always done with a marginal budget,"I was gravely disappointed in ""children of dune"". I had waited for the second installment after throughly enjoying the first. To my disappointment I found the second lacking in imagination. the impressive costuming of Dune was replaced by jeans and tank tops. The sets seemed like cheap studio flats.I will say that ""children of dune"" did follow to a great extent the storyline. For this I am grateful. I just wish that the producers of a series would not cut the bugets of sequals in order to make a quick buck off of an existing market. Quality people quality, not quanity will turn the trick.Over all I was greatly disappointed in the second installment of the dune series. I hope if they proceed they will do better next time."
1,Frank Herbert's Children of Dune (TV Miniseries) DVD,"I loved the first DUNE movie released in 1984. I must have watched it a dozen times over the years.This new stuff (Children of Dune) to me is not even science fiction. I would call it a boring soap opera.I've try to watch it several times, but lose interest.One of the reviews by Noctem said the 1984 Dune was a disaster. Noctem must feel that a movie has to be like the book or it's no good.I haven't read any of the books but I know the different between a good movie and one that's not worth watching.The old 1984 DUNE movie puts ""Children of Dune"" in the dirt."
1,How was this movie made?,"I thought that this world was one ruled by law and thus surely all the characters and even all the support personnel that had ANYTHING to do with bringing about the original Dune movie, whichever version presented, the long, the longer or the incredibly long version, would have immediately be ""aborted"", post-natal of course.Please tell me that was true and that there inst really a ""Children of Dune"" mini series in existance...please?"
5,happy customer,Easy to shop and order. The seller provided useful status updates and the item arrived very promptly and in satisfactory condition. A very pleasant buying experience.
5,Frank's legacy lives on!,"I first read Dune in 1986 as a kid. I loved it then and still do. I now have the entire collection of both Frank and Brian's books and will continue snatching them up as soon as they are printed.This movie covers Books 2 and 3 of the original Dune Chronicles (Dune Messiah and Children of Dune). They kind of missed the mark on character image, but absolutely nailed the storyline! This is one of the greatest movies of all time, based on the greatest science fiction saga to ever grace this planet."
4,Children of Dune Review,"This was a very good buy, I like the Dune saga and it was a good ending to the story line that Fank Herbert started."
5,Starts from nowhere and goes to nowhere but is fun to watch,"This made for TV series looks like the standard made for TV items on the Sci-Fi channel. However, most of the actors are well known (as Alice Krige ... Lady Jessica Atreides) and the others should and maybe will be well known. The actors do not overshadow the characters. The sets and costumes are better than the average made for TV sets and the dialog is not that droll-rehashed soap opera over the top tripe. The story follows the books (2nd and 3rd books in the original series) close enough for real dune people to enjoy.The story starts where the movies leave off and we get to see the politics and treachery along with the nobility of the nest couple of generations. In the end, we are left with the question ""What is the Golden Path?""Dune"
5,More Mini-series,"I thought that this mini-series was even better than the first. It kept Irulan and Paul and introduced some new, really cool charectars. And the music was amazing. Hopefully there is going to be even more. If you like this mini-series and would like another, then you should visit [...] and jion the petition on the discussion board."
3,"didn't do it for me, alas","This installment of the mini-series fell short for me, as vastly inferior to the original one of 2000. Not only did I no longer believe in Paul as the preacher - Newman is a great physical actor, not a religious orator - but the Alia actress was simply terrible and unconvincing. Then there is the house of Corrino, with the exception of Irulian and to a degree Sarandon, which also essentially fell flat for me. Leto II and his sister are quite good, however, and hopefully will appear in some version of God Emperor of Dune. In part, the Dune version by Artisan was so good, such as completely realised rendition of the original sci-fi classic, that this was bound to fail.Tepidly recommended. You can't win em all."
2,Frank Herbert's Children of Dune,"Certainly a disappointment for the book aficionado, as is often the case. Entertaining though with one great dead weight and that would be Sarandon, what a waste of breath. She exemplifies the Hollywood ditz that should just shut up and act - could have been cast better."
1,Boring and confusing,The first Dune was an OK movie however and this is an absolute bordumfest. I can't believe I sat through this garbage waiting for it to get interesting. It is boring plain and simple there is nothing entairtaning. It does deserve 1 star for the worms they are awsome. Other then that this is boring.
3,Lesbian Fiction,"This was an enjoyable read. The plot centers around Cass, a forty-something dyke in Austin who is trying to track down an old lover while simultaneously trying to figure out who murdered one of her acquaintances, and why. The quality of the writing is about what you'd see in an average popular fiction novel. In other words, the only reason this one wasn't published by a mainstream press was the content, not the quality. One small thing--I bought this book because somewhere on the web someone said it was science fiction. It isn't."
3,Bathory DVD,"I got the dvd today and was all excited to watch it, but as soon as I stuck it in the dvd player I found out the dvd was from the UK! They failed to mention it! I had to buy a multi regional dvd player the same day! Next time warn a person before they buy it!"
1,"No box with this so-called ""box set""","My big gripe with this release is that the disks come in a folding sleeve, but there's NO SLIP CASE for it. It's just left there to flop around or unfold or possibly have DVD's fall out accidently once the shrink wrap comes off. I realize that ShoutFactory! is a fledgling company to the world of DVD's, but come on, if you call something a box set then please include a box. Either release it in a snap case or include a box, please."
4,Loads of Personality,"Groucho Marx was great at thinking on his feet, and his caustic humor could always get laughs. Whether he was using puns or ribbing his guests, Groucho was at his best on You Bet Your Life, his quiz show that asked contestants trivia questions from predetermined categories in order to win money.Guests ranged from kooky citizens with interesting stories, like the hitch-hiker who wore a military uniform to gain drivers' trust and a sweet blonde who modeled herself after Marilyn Monroe, to full-fledged celebrities. Harpo Marx made an appearance on this show to promote his autobiography, but he didn't utter a word. Johnny Weissmuller let out his famous Tarzan yell.Each episode is interesting and entertaining; they encapsulate an era gone by. Although we still have quiz shows, we don't have personalities like Groucho Marx who is the glue that holds this show together. He has chemistry with everyone in one way or another and makes this a fine DVD set."
5,You Bet Your Life The Lost Episodes,"This collection is so cool. It features lost episodes that you cannot find anymore until now. It also has a feature where you can pick either episodes, extras, and outtakes. Groucho's wit is so subtile and funny, you can watch this CD over and over and over again and still laugh your head off! Groucho is truly in his element by being a quiz master and interviewing so many different people. His timing, his sense of humor and his jokes just hit home time after time!"
4,Brigth and beautiful,Is much more than I expected for the price... It was a x-mas gift for my niece (13 yo) and she loved it as much as I did. I totally recommended
5,Best book ever!!,"My son absolutely loves this book. They read it in his class, he is grade k. He talked about it every day for a week so I ordered it. He was so excised when it came in the mail he couldn't stop jumping up and down! I got the one with the cd so now he reads it every night in his room as he fallows along with the cd. It's really cute because we don't here anything unless he is at the part about the pumpkin cuz we hear really loud ""and the pumpkin goES BOO!!! it's great!"
3,Okay,"The story/illustrations were fine. The book sent was flimsy. I know it is a paperback, but it was a little too papery, not quite booky enough. Oh yeah - The content of the book is terrific. My 4 yo loves it."
5,ANY child would love this book!,"My 18 month old loves this story! My ""slow"" student in class loves this story----read it to the kids with props---someone in the shirt, someone wearing the hat, and someone lifting up a jack-o-lantern! Read it to them just TWICE and see how much they remember and enjoy! A little old lady goes for a walk in the woods and finds the objects of a scarecrow attempting scare her---she persuades the objects to scare the crows out of her cornfield instead! Read it on Halloween day! A must for classroom and at home! Any time of the year!"
2,Broken CD,The book I ordered came in great condition but the CD was broken. I haven't had time to return it.
5,family and school children fav,I have been reading this book to children for two decades and i had to share it with the next generationGreat book to do actions to the lines.
5,Miami 4th gr teacher,Excellent tool for instruction in multiple representation. Includes transparencies to assist visual learners and includes lesson ideas in a logical sequence. Highly recommend for helping students comprehend non-fiction text.
1,Long Speech,"The book is a long speech to convince you that you need to re-parent yourself, and doesn't explain what this actually means. It's like going to a restaurant and talking with the waiter all evening about the menu...."
1,"Poor Quality, Poor Experience",I was hopeful based on the other reviews that even though this product may be difficult to put together that it would be a decent piece of furniture. Not so. My husband was not having that much difficulty putting the item together until he got to the CAM locks that hold the drawers together and they kept breaking as he tightened them. He also pulled out the feet and saw that 1 of the feet was drilled incorrectly so it would not fit into the rest of the piece. It was simply beyond fixing. In addition to that it comes in 3 huge boxes weighing several hundred pounds. Amazon is unable to send correct parts so you must return EVERYTHING. And just a side note Amazon's return process is neither quick nor easy and we are still trying to figure out how to return the thing. Just save your time and money and get something else.
1,WORST PURCHASE EVER!,This is the worst purchase I have ever made. Peices were not cut straight and did not fit together like they were supposed to. Some pieces were scuffed or chipped and others were coming apart where they were glued together. The product came covered in dust/dirt and was in 100+ pieces. I would NEVER purchase this item or recommend it to anyone.
4,"very happy, good value for the money!","This is a beautiful piece of furniture, well made- no particle board anywhere. It took my husband about 2 hours to put it together, and it looks great- exactly like it looks in the picture. It's true that the drawers don't hold silverware trays, but we are using them as ""junk drawers,"" which is what we needed, so that's no problem. We are very happy with it and would definitely recommend it. Also, it came within a few days of placing the order, which was great."
4,Good product,"This is a very solid, sturdy piece of furniture, and real wood. You WILL need 2 people to assemble this and you will want a power screwdriver. The finish is perfect and looks like a much more expensive piece of furniture. All the pieces are extremely well labeled - no wondering which screws are for what. This was the best home assembled piece I have ever seen as far as labeling. The furniture itself was easy to put together, it's just HEAVY.It came with mounts to secure to the wall but, even with little ones in the house, it's not needed. That thing is not going anywhere. It's so heavy it would take a LOT to make it tip.I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars for a minor issue with the hutch - the door hinge on one side was a bit off and the magnets stick so bad it's hard to open and close. Also the drawers and cabinets are a bit smaller than I expected. It did fit my china setting for 8 plus serving pieces though.I would recommend this - it really does look terrific!"
3,Nice cabinet,"Nice cabinet. Beautiful color. However, drawers are very small. Picture is deceiving as the drawers look bigger. Some parts of the cabinet were damaged and I had to order replacements. The top of the buffet had several long marks on it and the company would not replace the top even though I sent them the pictures showing the marks. I did receive the other two parts that were damaged but I also had to take pictures of the damaged items and send them to the company along with the part numbers before they replaced them. If you need a lot of storage space, then I would advise not to order this cabinet but if you want something to fill an empty wall and you do not need a lot of storage space, then this cabinet will do nicely."
3,"Looks decent enough, but quality is not top notch","Took about 1.5 hrs for 2 people to assemble the bottom part.One of the drawers had to be redrilled because the factory had the holes reversed. I know it sounds like we probably made a mistake, but we each checked several times, the T4 piece had incorrect drillings, the holes were actually underneath draw slider, which comes pre-assembled, and that would not make sense.There was slight damage to visible parts during shipping, although it was packaged quite sufficiently. I'd blame the damage on Fedex for roughing up the packages unneccessarily.We'll be tackling the upper piece tonight and applying some sem-gloss where the damage is visible. It's still a keeper even though it wasn't pristine. There's too much time vested now..."
4,Beautiful Piece!,"This is a beautiful piece. I had one damaged piece and it was replaced with no hassle. Assembly was not difficult (I'm over 50 female). I've had many, many compliments on the buffet/hutch."
3,A LOT OF ASSEMBLY required,"I didn't realize that these items arrive completely disassembled. Fortunately, I've had a lot of practice lately putting furniture together. The instructions were straight-forward. However, considering the hours I spent assembling the two pieces, I think they were over-priced."
4,Comfortable after the first wear,"The first time I wore these shoes, I was crushed because they're really attractive but they gave me terrible blisters (which then tore open to become ugly sores) on the inside of my foot where the strap attaches to the shoe body. They were also a little tight. I've worn them since, however, and they are now among my most comfortable shoes. They're beautifully constructed and the soles are completely silent (important to me since the floors are marble where I work and I hate that prissy ""tick tick tick"" sound made by most high heels). Overall, a great shoe, but you might want to break them in by wearing them around the house, maybe even with socks on."
2,ouch,"I consistently wear a 9.5 M. Not so for these shoes! They are so narrow, my feet were squishing out the sides. Not comfortable at all. Otherwise, they seem to be of good quality leather and are well made. Too bad I can't wear them..."
2,So Cute but hurt,"I wish I would have listened to the other reviews. This does run small. However, it is so cute. I really love the look but can't wear them on a long day."
1,So sad!,These shoes hurt my feet. I can't even wear them. The sole on the inside has a black leather design running through the center that is raised and gives you a nice blister on the bottom of your foot. I have very narrow feet and this show rubs and pinches. This is my first Clarks purchase and I will never make that mistake again!
4,Andersonville,"A little long and a little slow. I had trouble with Richard Basehart's accent for his character. It's an interesting film that shows the bias in history, as Basehart's character mentions, that there were other such prisons in the north during the war, but no one talks about them. There are also numerous philosophical arguments regarding the entire immorality of the concept of such prisons, even if during a time of war. I did learn more about the prison from this film than I did from either the Hollywood version or any Internet film about this subject."
4,Andersonville Trial,"A gripping court-room drama,not as good as ""12 Angry Men"" but very emotional . William Shatner hams it up as he always does, but this is a good performance. Captain Werz, the evil commandant is nobly portrayed as saying that he did not have the supplies to feed the (starving) prisoners and kicks the blame up to his superior officer, Gen. Wilder. Having seen the ""Andersonville"" (Ted Turner)movie and read about this I know that this court had been rigged against Werz and he was headed for the gallows anyway-but he had his share of the blame by personally abusing and striking prisoners. I highly recommend this as a companion to those that enjoyed the ""Andersonville"" film."
2,"Great Play, Terrible DVD","I remembered this play from when it was first on PBS and eagerly bought the DVD. Some of the actors give great performances. Richard Basehart is outstanding. Jack Cassidy shows he can excell in a drama. Cameron Mitchell, in a supporting role, gives a performance of a lifetime. The great weak spot is William Shatner. Still a great play is worth seeing...BUT the DVD is terrible. The sound annoying. Find another way to see this play!"
4,good show,This is good drama and pretty good (although not perfect) history. William Shatner CAN act. He struck just the right balance in this show.
3,A rare find but...,...be prepared for the poor quality of transfer of vhs to dvd. If you remember actually seeing this on television when it was originally broadcast. Enjoy your memories and buy one of the excellent books on the subject.
5,DVD,This was a very interesting movie! I had heard about this trial but learned many new facts/information about this event! Highly Recommend this movie!
3,Scratched when received,"I bought these as a gift for someone. They seem cute enough, however, since there is no insulating material within the package, some of the heads looked scratched and some of the paint seemed to have come off onto one of the other heads. This is particularly noticeable on the lighter colored heads. Just a little disappointing since this was meant as a gift."
5,"yes, this is the stipplicon you've been looking for!","If you have heard this album before you are probably buying it now. If you haven't...well it is something you must listen to once in your life. These people put on a great show, I only wish there were a live album. I can't say if this band is still going, but this CD is the supreme testament to their profound musical sensibilities. It may be their only recording so get this while you can. One of my favorite tracks is LIFE SIZE.Lyrics, Guitars, AND Rhythm all extremely well done. Enjoy."
2,more of a review,"buckland has a better sumary of this and practice examples. this is more of a review after reading that.silver ravenwolkf has some useful examples as well, but they are extremely lengthy."
2,Special Printer Needed,Be advised that just because you printer has an IR input doesn't mean it will work. Only a very few printers are compatible. Check the PrintBoy web site first for list of printers that will work.
5,Austalian Rainforest sounds with beautiful ambient piano,"This release has sold over 300,000 copies since its release. It was the first Rainforest release in Australia and possibly the world. Kens unique ability to capture simple melodies and mix them with crsytal clear nature recordings have made him a household name in Austalia. he has a staggering Thirty Three CD Listing take a look!"
4,Fated Love,"Wonderfully written, i could not stop reading! A beautiful journey of love an passon,consuming you as you read along with honor and Quinn."
5,Fabulous,"Wonderfully developed characters. Very romantic and extremely sexy! I love this book. Radclyffe's creativity is a gift that, thank goodness, she shares."
4,Good read. Good story.,"I enjoyed this book. It's well-written & contains a good story. My only complaint is I felt like Honor's failure to act on her growing feelings due to past heartbreak & loss was drawn out a tad too long, but otherwise it's certainly worth the read & I will read it again, eventually."
3,Pretty Good Disc,"I actually came to know this band by hearing one of their songs featured in NHL 2002 for Playstation 2. I'm happy I did, because this is a great CD to listen to and have a good time with. It's not earth-shattering, but the music is fun at times, harder edged at others, and is never boring. My favorite song is Brand New Low (as featured on NHL 2002), but the rest are very listenable. Overall, a very good disc...pick it up if you're looking for something new."
2,*sigh*... Treble Charger used to be good,"Wide Awake Bored is a monumental disappointment. With it, Treble Charger, a band that used to create great sounding and catchy Canadian alternative with a hint of pop-rock, has totally de-evolved further into the world of pop punk or straight out pop, even going so far as to play up their friendship with Sum-41 (aka the Antichrists). While the music remains catchy due to the raw talent of the band, the lyrics and overall musical depth are nothing. Perhaps the biggest mistake was by establishing Greg Nori as the ""true"" lead singer when Bill Priddle is far more talented. Perhaps they just wanted to go mainstream, and they've certainly established that.Check out ""Self = Title"" or ""Maybe It's Me"" if you want to see Treble Charger when they did something with the talent they posessed. I am not one that uses the word ""sellout"", but this album fits the description more than any other I have heard."
4,Very Good Overall,"1. 4/5 Brand New Low: 3rd verse is catchy because of it's similarly to other songs.2. 5/5 American Psycho: Pretty solid. The verses are better than the chorus.3. 5/5 Business: Chorus is really catchy with the backup high vocals.4. 4/5 Cheat Away: Good, wouldn't like it at first. The 2nd chorus and stereo bridge is nice.5. 3/5 Funny: I think the guitars are annoying but the singing is good.6. 5/5 Favourite Worst Enemy: Underrated. Everything is very catchy; very singalongable. Their most poppy pop-punk song. Can get annoying.7. 5/5 More's The Pity: Everything is perfect including the nice long ending. The ooooh at the end of the chorus is cool.8. 2/5 I Don't Know: My least favourite track. The chorus is annoying.9. 5/5 Wear Me Down: Sounds like a surfing song. Also very catchy and singalongable.10. 3/5 Another Dollar: Cool intro. Good but not the best.11. 4/5 Just What They Told Me: Nice holy-ish instrumental. Nice guitar during it.This album gets a 4.5 not a 4."
3,treble charger rocks,"this is a very good album, but treble charger is too much of a pop band and the album loses its edge as it goes on. however, the first two songs alone make this a 3 star album. dont buy it, just download the first few songs. i actually heard of this band through the video game nhl 2002. theyre too much like sellouts."
2,a disappointment,"This book is almost totally useless unless you only want to create small-scale simple MFC applications in Visual C++. That's an extremely narrow market. I'll admit, if it fits you, you probably won't complain, but i was quite disappointed with the lack of usefulness and living up to it's cover. It says it is a complete guide to windows 98, etc. but it doesn't handle any true win32, just mfc. I think if they renamed it the Visual C++ MFC Bible, i could take it more seriously. As it is, it was very misleading to me and is just collecting dust on my shelf."
2,No enough explanation,As a new programmer to MFC I found that this book did not have enough explanation of the classes and options. Also I found that the book relies too much on the App Wizard in Visual C++. I felt that using the App Wizard as a new programmer only created more questions and those questions weren't explained in this book. One good thing is that this book does cover a lot of topics that others do not.
3,It is a good book for new programer,"I get this book as a free gift. In fact, I think there are not much new topics. But there are really some interesting topics.So if you want to know how to program a MFC program in Windows'98. It is good. And if you want to get some interesting topics such as Data Encryption. You can buy it too. But don't expect it have many such topics."
1,Nothing New About The NFL,"This book about life in the NFL is really a series of very short essays. There is absolutely nothing new here and the essays are so short that there is no depth at all to the individual subject matters. The cover of the book really tries to draw you in by claiming to tell you about the ""dark"" side of the NFL, but frankly there is very little dirt here, and certainly none that hasn't already been out in the public domain for some time. Granted this book was published around 12 years ago, but given the content I am surprised it is even still in print.As a football fan, I am disappointed. There is not much to recommend here."
4,Interesting and eye-opening,"A very good, behind-the-scenes look at the NFL from a player's perspective. It may not give everyone the ""dirt"" on specific players that they might want, but it does give the reader a unique view of the NFL from the player's perspective. I learned a lot by reading it and was fascinated to know what it's like for an NFL recruit/rookie.If you are an NFL fan, it's worth reading."
3,Dark Side Not Up To Hype,"This book does tell somewhat of what its like in the NFL, but on most of the accounts its based on one persons view. I am sure the writer had first hand knowledge, but he paints a picutre of the NFL that makes it look bad. In a time where image is everything the writer seems to paint a bad picture of the NFL. I found the book hard to read and it too me a long time to read it. There are other NFL books out there that I am sure are better, but I have yet to find one. This book is ok, it takes you behind the scenes in the locker rooms, the training rooms, the hotels and travel. It gives you a first hand look at what the players do on the field and off the field. However I don't think it was written all that well."
2,The Lightweight Side of the Game,"Though it professes to be a frank tell-all expose of the NFL, Tim Green's ""Dark Side of the Game"" is nothing of the sort. Green is a third-tier broadcast analyst for NFL games on television and he is clearly still far too indebted to the league to be truly critical of it. Every time you thinks he's strating to get to the good stuff, he pulls his punch and lets the league off the hook. The result is a wishy-washy mish-mash of some gossipy dirty laundry being aired without any information truly damaging to the league's powers that be. And might I add this; as a writer, Green is a lightweight. Rarely in this book does his prose rise above the level of the barely compotent."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought that a book entitled ""The Dark Side of the Game"" would present a no-holds-barred look at the underside of the NFL. Instead, Green comes off more as an apologist. Moreover, his prose is boringly simplistic. If you're looking for something more than light reading, look elsewhere."
3,"Dark Side of the Game, is a major disappointment","Tim Green's ""Dark Side of the Game"" is a major letdown to those fans expecting a journey through the many unchartered waters of the NFL. Green dangles his unquestioned NFL experience and insights, without ever letting his audience devour his wealth of knowledge. After reading his book I expected to have black and blue bruises from having shared in his past battles in the trenches. I expected to leave with scores of untold stories about NFL life that only a veteran as Green could tell. However, I left as exactly as I came, a diehard fan still curious about the Dark Side of the Game."
4,Very satisfying model to build,"I have built LEGO models for many years, but the cost of buying them is just too high. This model was an absolute bargain (back when I bought it for $25) based on the number of pieces alone, the model is huge. It is quite a challenge to assemble, the design is clever but not intuitive, so you really have to follow the instructions carefully (makes use of a LOT of flat pieces in clever ways that can be frustrating). I had a lot of fun building it and it looks great when complete. It would be nice if the turret were more securely fastened to the body in the finished model, but if you like LEGO-type models, you can't go wrong with this one. Despite it's working treads and moveable turret/cannon, this is a model and I don't intend to ""play"" with it (much)."
3,Not as durable as the others,"I recently put the M1A1 Abrams tank together, it was my 4th mega bloks set to put together. Although it cool to look at once it is done, it was bear to put together. Since I'm 23 years old i dont ""play"" with it, but even when i move it or dust it the pieces still fall off."
1,bubble pop/rock fluff of a tribute,"Only ""Two Little Fishes"" comes close to capturing Tharpe's sound. The rest of the album is top 40 radio sounding bubblegum pop fluff versions of good songs. The song ""Shout Sister Shout"" is also given nice treatment, but 90% of this tribute is wasteland kiddie pop. this ends up being more of an insult then a tribute to Tharpe? Where are the Blind Boys of Alabama, where's Lavay Smith???"
1,FALLING from ORBIT,"FIRST GENERATION is a collection of early 4-track demos made while the band was still forming.If you want to hear bad, muffled, monophonic versions of ""Love-Missile F-11"" or ""Sex-Bomb-Boogie,""then this CD is for you. But why would you want to? The sound quality is horrible,and it's difficult to figure out how these ugly little songs ever led to a major recording contract.Also included are a handful of 8-track demos recorded in the early 90's.These songs might have been interesting if they weren't so boring.Unless you're a Die-Hard Sputnik Fan, intent on owning EVERYTHING ever recordedby Sigue Sigue Sputnik, this is a worthless CD.By the way, there are about 3 different versions of this CD,often referred to as ""1st Edition"", ""2nd Edition"" and ""3rd Edition.""They are all essentally the same album with different cover art, andeach ""Generation"" has 1 or 2 extra tracks than the version that preceded it.They're all equally boring, though..."
3,"Good enough, but too many defects","At least two great condcutors--Karajan and Klemperer--have done a magnificent job with the Dutchman on disc, along with one excellent conductor, Sinopoli. Dorati isn't in their class, and his way with Wagner is to push too hard and neglect the romanticism and poetry. Of the singers, no one is first rate. George london's grainy voice and staunch, usually loud portrayal wears thin despite his commanding presence. Giorgio Tozzi's Doland lacks character and forcefulness.Rysanek comes close to being the center of interest. She has a full, mature dramatic soprano voice, far from the girlish Senta, and her top notes can be squally, but she dives into the role with her usual super-intensity. That counts for a lot, but not enough to lift this Dutchman into excellence."
4,Family problems.,"Unable to convince Case McCord to marry her, Prudence Kenyon leaves, keeping her pregnancy a secret. When Case realizes Pru is carrying his baby, he must work to woo her back and convince her he wants to marry her. After the marriage, Pru works on reuniting Case with his family and clearing up the mystery surrounding the death of Case's fiance.I've always liked when the heroine defends the hero without knowing the whole story. This is one of those books. Pru is wonderful and Case is truly appreciative. While his family should've known Case better than to believe the story told, it was a deathbed statement, taken far too seriously in most cultures. I, for one, believe that marriage should be for each adult involved, not for the sake of the child. The child suffers when the parents are together only for them, believe me."
3,"Re-write of her Amanda Quick ""Ravished.""","This book, copywritten in 1987, is a modern-day version of one of Ms. Krentz's most successful Amanda Quick novels, ""Ravished."" The plot line still works, however I enjoyed this story when written for Harriet and Gideon; it seemed to work better for the characters. ""The Family Way"" is still a fun read, but becomes a bit of a let-down for die-hard Krentz/Quick fans."
4,Good Sunday Afternoon read,"I have read almost all of JAK's books and I enjoyed re-reading this one. The story line was good, plot was good, characters were good, and the ending was good. If you read an authors books over a long period, then re-read an earlier novel, you appreciate how far the author has come. Bravo to JAK for her talent, people are easy to criticize what they can not accomplish themselves."
5,what a book!!!,"very informative,i liked the history included with the guide,have recommended the book to my friends,very reasonably priced should have ordered two"
4,Shows the talent,"Talk about a hard to find cd. Over it is a great band(besides thier latest release) and this is some good, raw, fast melodic punk music...the way it should be. Only thing is the second half of the cd(from the Ready Series) is just to raw sounding for me. I only listen to the first 5 songs(re-released from Hindsight is 2020) which are stupidly good. THis really shows where Over it came from and were the groundworks for great albums like ""Timing..."" and ""Silverstrand"". Truly is a hidden gem"
3,Didn't resonate for me,"I'm a beginning meditator in a similar Vipassana discipline that Peter Conradi practices and picked up ""Going Buddhist"" hoping to find some inspiration for my practice. The best I can say is that I'm apparently not the audience for this book. I found the prose too abstract in tone to engage me and the content often too detailed on tangents (e.g. in discussing Tibetan history). The Iris Murdoch references were altogether lost on me; the author's actual experiences with Buddhism are sparse until the last chapter."
4,Solid western story is a hidden gem,"This western is a decent entry to the cavalry-Indian theme that was a mainstay of westerns of the 1950s. The Gadsden Purchase is the basis for this tale of warfare in Arizona between the Apaches, Mexicans and Comanches, with the American troops on hand to make peace with Cochise and prevent raids by the Comanches into Mexico. The film has several nice action scenes but the editing is sloppy and diminishes its overall impact. Robert Stack and John Hodiak are the main characters with Hodiak doing well as Cochise in spite of his somewhat mannered portrayal. Stack, the future Eliot Ness, is typically no-nonsense as the cavalry major who is smitten with a Mexican woman, played by Joy Page."
1,Absurd,"Once and again DC Comics keep making stories full of characters and with plots that make it difficult to continue and understand. All starts with things we knew about Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, and as the story goes everything tuns into a mess of villains and heroes coming and going, of twists and things that only make the story even more boring. At the end of the story you don't understand anything you wasted al leats one hour of your life and a lot of money. And they use several artists that make this story lose even more quality. DC must rethink the quality of their characters and the stories because they're getting absurd number after number, every day I understand why Marvel is beating them on sales. Don't waste time and money in this junk."
2,Ha! I made it through,"You can try to retcon me out of existence, but I'll show you!!! I'm in it for the long-haul. No hack comic book churners can get rid of a long-time fan favorite like myself. Not as a token death, not as a reimagining! I yam that I yam!That said, I enter this series with some trepidation. On can clearly see that as"
1,How could you? Why would you?,"In 1985, Marv Wolfman and George Perez took on the incredible challenge of bringing all the alternate universes in the DC world and converting them into one uniformed world. While I didn't think it was necessary, it was an excellent read. I regretted the deaths of Supergirl, Flash, and others, but I felt they did a nice job.One of the highlights of the story was the 'final' fate of the Golden Age Superman and Lois Lane. They, along with Alexander Luthor and Superboy Prime had made enormous sacrifices to save lives and were rewarded with an eternity of peace and happiness.Then, here come Geoff Johns who decides that these four heroes need to be destroyed. Johns rarely thinks about the character or the fan when he writes a story. He writes from the 'wouldn't it be cool' mentality.If you enjoyed 'Crisis on Infinite Earths' from 1985, stay far, far away from this abomination. While COIE brought heartfelt tears, IC brings nothing but tears of regret."
3,Superboy Punch!,"This series is oft-mocked by Marvel execs and comic fans for the ""Superboy punch"" that brought dead characters back to life (such as Robin II aka Jason Todd) and slightly altered Batman's origin (I think...it was never really directly addressed in the Batman books). This ""punch"" was supposed to ""fix"" incongruities in DC continuity, but if you're worried about continuity then that probably means that you're taking super-hero comics just a little too seriously.And that's the main problem here--this series buckles under the weight of seriousness. ""Infinite Crisis"" started off with a bullet-in-the-head of Blue Beetle (not included in this collection!), and ended with a bullet-in-the-head of one of the major villains. In between, other characters were killed in similarly brutal fashion...and for what? The art is gorgeous, but the storyline became too convoluted to follow as the series progressed."
2,Infinite Crisis a disappointment,"As a young teenager, Crisis on Infinite Earths made a big impression on me. I was a big Wolfman-Perez fan from the New Teen Titans, and was amazed with the effort that went into the Crisis storyline. So I was naturally curious about the Infinite Crisis product. Though I'd always wondered what ever became of Alex Luthor-Lois Lane-Superman-Superboy Prime at the end of Crisis, I quickly realized that Infinite Crisis was a serious mistake and those four characters should have been left alone. The corruption of Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor was not believeable, nor was the duping of the Earth 2 Superman (The Greatest DC Universe hero of all time!) obviously forced in order to make the Infinite Crisis storyline go. So I cannot recommend this weak book."
4,Very good tie ins to the DC multiverse,"The book is a great read for those who want to have some closure on the DC Multiverse. I did my research before I purchased this product so I knew what I would be getting. Great artwork to accompany the story telling. (Who knew Batman even cared!)Of course when you get this many artists together, there will be some periods where the artwork is not what it should be! (The Supermen battle falls way short artistically and is the only point where the story falll short!)Outside of those two items, this is a excellent book. The delievery from Amazon was great! On-time and the book was in great condition."
4,The end of the world...again...,"This book took a long time to find its legs. In the end I wasn't really sure what about the book needed to be told. All things being equal, this felt like a story that was being told because DC wanted to do something earth shattering. These large scale comic events are great once every five to ten years but it seems to be that the earth is consistently being torn and retorn to shreds. Scale back DC, then when you threaten to destroy the world it will mean something!"
4,A decent read,A nice perspective on what solitude can do. Having the best intentions and desire can bring. A must-read for me and old fans.
4,infinite crisis,good book. very good storyline to follow from start to finish...shows the strength of the writers and animators...would recommend highly..
3,Cleanup time at DC,"These crisis events are basically superhero elimination time at places like DC. With so many characters it's very easy to dispose of extraneous characters in a collection like this without evoking a super emotional response. Which is somewhat sad in it's on right. Overall the story telling and artwork in this collection are decent enough to make it one of the superior ""crisis"" titles from DC. Essential reading for DC completists."
2,Too busy,"Infinite Crisis covers a lot of events that are important to the DC storyline, but the Graphic Novel itself it's too busy and often hard to follow."
1,Maravillosa mini-enciclopedia de Info. de Admon.de Proyectos,"Altamente recomendable, a pesar de ser un pequeño libro (en cuanto a no. de hojas) el contenido es sustancial, directo y muy bien explicado.No importa que no este usted muy familiarizado con términos de Administración de Proyectos, este es un libro esencial como un curso introductorio de planeación."
2,Did not appreciate from the start,"I have used Quicken (pc) for decades and was sick of them as much as the next person. Quicken's 3 year sunset mode is a crime. I trialed MD 2011 and was disappointed immediately at the interface. Guess I've been brainwashed by Quicken's ease of use. I do simple finance which even Quicken Starter can handle. I'm sure MD can out-pace Quicken on many levels but not for a simple user. MD did not download my correct (verified) checking acct. balance. It was way off, but tweakable. Online bill pay was a less flexible and was too basic even for me. Decided not to explore MD further and re-upped on Quicken. Maybe 3 yrs from now Md interface will improve so I'm not chained to Quicken anymore."
2,Just like all the Mac finance software,"Quicken Essentials has not been updated in, well too long. So I tried Moneydance. It is nothing special. Menus are not logical. The layout so not friendly. You have to click on the top to use something at the bottom. The fonts are too small. The pulldown menus open with the least used choices first. Setting up printing requires manual testing instead of using the most common format. I personally quit trying to download a quicken file, and entered directly instead.While Quicken Essentials is only 20% of the Windows version, it is far better than this."
2,"Looks nice, lacks the basics","I was hoping to switch from Quicken to a Linux program like Moneydance so I tried the demo. On first glance, it seemed speedy and feature-rich. Then I clicked an unlabeled button to see what it did, and... it deleted a whole account without any warning or confirmation, and without undo! Ouch. That is too dangerous for my taste.On a smaller note, it was also easy to make Moneydance display incorrectly sized pie charts: just resize the window. The chart gets big when you enlarge the window, then stays big after you reduce the window again. That shouldn't happen.This review is based on 10 minutes of checking out the program. It might be great but the deletion event made me nervous."
3,Not ready for prime time,"Moneydance is a smooth product for those who want to escape the Quicken and Money. The interface is simple and intuitive, and it allows for multicurrency transactions. Unfortunately for those of us who have and want to preserve financial records, investments, brokerage accounts, going back over several years, Moneydance cannot at present smoothly take over .qif files. For anybody who wants to start from scratch, Moneydance is a great idea, although it still seems to be a beta rather than a market ready product."
2,Try the demo first,"I downloaded the demo version for Mac OS 10.5; my quicken files imported easily. I downloaded the QIF file to update my Visa account, but most of my transactions were flagged as possible duplicates (even though they were all new). The interface was really clunky: Most transaction were entered one at a time after making a selection as what to do from a pop-up. My 100 transactions for the demo were quickly used up after several attempts to import and reconcile my statement. This SW is too cumbersome to use."
2,NOT YET READY FOR DVD,"Having just watched this dvd version (Apparently the only DVD availble) and I was very disappoinbted in the picture quality. In fact, it is the worst I have every encountered on a DVD opera. It appears that the theatre production people were unaware that a video recording requires a great deal more lighting than usual. Most of the scenes were so dark that it was almost impossible to make out who was singing unless you were aware of the voices.I have over 100 0pera DVDs in my collection and this one is by far, the worst one I have wasted my money on."
5,Fast install and awesome quality!,Talk about fast! No need to spend extra $ or time installing those silly rings. I got this curtain up in less than a minute! I am happy with my purchase and I'm confident that you will feel the same! Bravo Hookless!
3,good but not as waterproof as it could be,"This item really brightened up my shower! It lets in much more light that the plastic white (vinyl) curtains.My biggest problem with it is the fact water goes right through it, if the shower head accidentally gets aimed at it. If it's indirect water, it rolls right down as it should... but I wouldn't hang it in a shower where kids might play with a shower massage on a hose. I could see where you'd end up with a really wet floor.Otherwise it's been good. It's been up for months and it's been stain and mildew resistant. So far no tears, breaks, etc."
1,just bad,"I used a small amount but the stuff just does not do much look who the verified purchasers are when looking at the reviews I would return the stuff if I could.really bad marks on the windshield and it was pretty much impossible to get rid of the smear marks it left on my windshield, like little bird tracks and no beading of water at all!"
4,Another tutorial book,This is more for the advanced baker but has some great tips and recipes. Dry reading but you will pick up ideas and techniques along the way as well as different types of grains and additives to improve your dough.
3,"The best of ""Blueprint 2"".","I'm not sure why so many people seem to have a problem with this release. All he did was put the better stuff from the 2-disc ""Blueprint 2"", onto 1 disc for those people that wanted it. If you don't want it, don't buy it. I do admit it's not one of his best, but there's still some sweet jams on here. Included is ""Excuse Me Miss"", ""Hovi Baby"", and ""03' Bonnie And Clyde"", with Beyonce. The opener ""A Dream"" is pretty good, and there's also ""Guns & Roses"" with Lenny Kravitz, which is odd, but interesting. The two bonus tracks are good, but not worth buying this twice for. So overall, it may not be the best of ""Jay-Z"", but it is the best of ""Blueprint 2""."
2,not worth buying,"This album contains jigga's favorite tracks off B2. there are two new joints called ""stop"" which is produced by Swizz Beats and ""Excuse Me Miss Again"" which is produced by the Neptunes. the two songs have killer beats with decent lyrics to them. The album is a cheap attempt to get people to spend 15 bucks. this cd is only intended for the hardcore jigga fans out there."
3,This isnt the Best Of the Cd,"The Tracklist you provided is great, too bad the cd isnt the same, Too Many Hoes isnt on the cd which is one of my favorite songs, And i hate Guns and Roses. The Swizz Beats Bonus is sweet though, maybe there will be a blueprint 2.2 so he can get it right"
1,GREED!!!GREED!!!GREED!!!,"It makes absolutely no sense to buy this weak cd because this is the same as the blue print 2 with the exception of 2 songs.In my opinion most of the songs are weak anyways.He made this cd to fool people into buying it and in order to give him more money.This guy does not care about his fans or no hood,so stop supporting him already and save your money.All he cares about is caviar,crystal,jewelry,rides and cash.DO NOT BUY THIS WEAK CD!!!"
3,Hmm...Another Jay-z classic?,"I liked this CD because it was basically the hot joints from Blueprint 2 The gift and the curse. Its the same songs in different orders. For that Jay gets one clap. I would've liked to see more from him than just the same songs rearranged with like 2 bounus joints. But if you have Blueprint 2....dont bother getting this. Like I said, it's the same songs... Dame, Haffa, Jay..where ya'll at man...hit me harder next time. but till then ...ITS THE ROC"
4,"Better Then It's, 1st Release","whell it's the same album of ""the gift and the curse"" but cut down to the more better tracks off the double album to form one disc of the best picks.....the songs blend nicely on this one disc blueprint2.1 plus 2 new unreleased bonus tracks ""stop' and ""la la la (excuse me again)""only flaws are it's missing the more dark heavy tracks like ""daimond is forever"" and ""blueprint2"" which murders ""nas- ehter"" diss track, jay-z won this round with this song. ""some people hate"" could've poped up also ""i did it my way"" is missed on this one.besides those missing tracks its good he knocked off the other tracks that wouldn't be missed that much, its a 3.5 it's a great album just not classic as his 2001 release of ""the blueprint""that's why some people say its disapointing they where exspecting an other classic he'll be back next year with that classic don't worry."
5,See?,"I can't stand all these people who say Jay-z don't care about his fans. He dropped this probably cuz stores sell double albums for too much money.And I cant stand everyone who say Blueprint2 was bad, hell no it wasn't bad, it was the realest jigga album yet.The two bonus tracks are ill as *$$!Sellout or not, man it doesnt matter, jigga knows what he's doin. Like he says, us blacks gotta make it out the hood one day and this just what he doing (even if he signs a little girl to his label [young steff or whatever])"
2,A Blueprint Bust!,Ok I'm a big Jay-Z fan but not that big of a fan. It's the R.O.C. all the way but now it's getting ridiculous!Only if you are a super big Jay-Z/Roc-a-fella fan and you need every Jay-Z CD then this CD is a must. But if not and you already got Blueprint 2 then don't even bother.The only HIGH point of this CD is that it is in a good order to were you won't have to skip.....in other words you can be lazy and won't have to press the skip button. And that is really the only purpose to this CD.The bonus tracks are hott....but not hott enough to buy this whole CD. I don't encourage downloading music off P2P networks(like Kazaa)but I rather you download the bonus tracks than buy a CD with the same songs just in a different order.WARNING: BLUEPRINT 2.1 IS ONLY FOR JAY-Z JUNKIES!!!...and if you got Blueprint 2 don't bother even looking at this one. This whole Blueprint 2 project was a bust...A Very Disappointed Jay-Z Fan is Cooper04....peace folks!
2,FREE,"That's right this c.d. should be free. O.k. let me get this right-first Jay-z drops buleprint2(garbage) now this a whack little collection of songs that he thinks are his best off of his whack c.d. He has the nerves to give us the buyers some new cuts like everyone was going to be like, I just brought the blueprint2, but I just gotta go spend 11 dollars again on the same c.d. with some extra tracks. I just don't understand the need for this c.d., and why does Jay-z have no mustache. Just pick up the c.d. and look at him--yeah I think so too. Like I wanted to hear a track produced by Heavy D--Heavy D give me a break. Jay-Z is doing too much for me. I think jay-z should be injected with sars and put in prison for thinking that everyone wanted to buy the same c.d. and for a heavy D track. Jay-Z BOOOOOOO"
1,should give 0 stars,the worst rap album ever. same crap over and over from blueprint 2buy any 2pac album instead
1,EAST BAY THUGG,"MAN I HATE THIS GARBAGE CD , DONT BUY THIS WEAK ONE HITTER QUITER ALBUM FROM THIS MAN! .... I DONT THINK HES PUTTIN ANYTHIN NEW OUT SOUNDS LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE EAST COAST $H!# , GO HEAD N CALL ME A HATER I AINT MAD!"
3,Average,"The only reason JayZ released this album is becasue he realized he had 2 many wack songs on the double cd. Should have only released 1 cd in the first place. Jayz definately fell off on this album from a classic Blueprint 1 to an average rap album. I was not amused by Jayz's new projects. Jayz needs to reclaim his self next time around better. Perfectly summed up in the words of Common ""I can tell how you rap you ain't hungry no more"""
3,3.5 TO BE EXACT,LOVE THE SONGS SELECTED.IF THERE WAS NO BLUEPRINT 2 THIS ALBUM WOULD BE A CLASSIC...I GAVE IT THIS RATING BECAUSE PEOPLE COULD HAVE MADE THIS AT HOME THEMSELVES.
3,please,"I was a bit annoyed with this album,fisrt of all the best song on here is probably dream feat b.i.g.The thing that was annoying was that the bonus tracks were really good,instead of putting them in normal tracks u have to wait until the last track on the album is finish.Otherwise it just goes back to the start.There are'nt that many good songs either apart from dream and excuse me miss,and the bonus songs.Most of the songs are wasted,its ok but your better off getting nas-god's'son or unreasonable doubt."
2,And the point of this album is....what?,"Don't get me wrong, I love Jay-Z but I don't understand why he'd even drop this album.The guy is near the top of the rap game, but it seems like he pretty much made this album just to add a couple of stacks of cash to his collection. All of these songs can be found on Blueprint 2 except for two bonus tracks. The bonus tracks are hot, but there's no need to buy this album unless you don't own Blueprint 2. This album is basically a 'Blueprint 2 Greatest Hits' collection. At least he put 'A Dream' on here. I really love that song. Definitly one of Hov's best tracks since Reasonable Doubt dropped. But stay away from this album, just get Blueprint 2 and download the bonus tracks."
2,Jimmy Dorsey's Geatest Hits - Curb D2-77411,"This album is something of a misnomer, because while Jimmy Dorsey's orchestra does play on every cut, almost every cut really highlights the vocalists, who unfortunately are not credited on the liner notes! They are probably Bob Eberly and Helen O'Connell, who sang many duets with Jimmy Dorsey's orchestra, but if you are looking for an album that shows Jimmy's expertise on the clarinet and tenor sax to advantage, look elsewhere. On the other hand if you would like an album of duets by a great pair of singers of the 40's and 50's, this may be exactly what you are looking for.I am disappointed with the liner notes, or rather I should say the absence of them, since they don't credit the individual personnel on any of the cuts. I am sure that information was available right on the record label to whomever copied these old 78's, and I wish that they had passed it along."
2,Jimmy Dorsey & Orchestra - Greatest Hits,I was disappointed in the quality of the recording. The needle noise inthe recording was more prevalent than on a c.d. that I had burned from an old vinyl record.
5,"BUY, BUY,BUY!!!!!!","if you are a fan of frenzal this album is a must have! it shows how far frenzal have come from their first garage-recordings to now, top notch sounds. every album of frenzal is a must have by the way, and this one is one of the best, behind meet the family and not so tough now, but very close. the humorous lyrics are done only the way that Jay can do it, and the guitar from lindsay is amazing. there is a new bassist too on this album, who is the son of S. Aus newsreader for all you aussies. to cap it off, buy buy buy!!"
4,The Faith has returned,This album is awsome and I regained my faith in the almighty Rhomb. (because they went a bit down-hill after 'not so tough now') This album is funny and good. and if your pissed it's even better.I cant belive they got rid of lex tho.
5,If you like NOFX or Lagwagon you'll love Frenzal!,"This CD is great! I bought it not knowing if it would be good or not, I had only downloaded a song from www.fatwreckchords.com and I must say, this is one of the best albums of 2003, and Frenzal's best CD to date! Buy this CD you'll love it...first download ""Punisher"", ""Ballchef"", and...uhhhh...""Lead Poison Jean""...then buy it."
5,Internal Combustion,"It's hard to imagine that a trio can pump out this much music. The first two songs on the CD really grab you wanting for more and Tryptonite keeps on giving you just What U Want. Then they finish with two rip your head off songs with Snakeskin Style, a Texas style bluesy song with ripping guitar licks and then the CD finishes you off leaving you totally spent with Tryptonite's version of Jimmi Hendrick's Vodoo Chile.I bet these guys are a great act live!This band is going places and I forecast that we will be hearing them on the radio real soon.Great job and can't wait for your new CD."
3,Good cd's,The CD works well but the first night I played it all night and my brain was very tired the next day. After that I just used it to fall asleep and let it shut off and it worked much better.
4,Great - give it a try. But I prefer his Brainwave Symphony.,"I wish there was a 4 1/2 stars rating - this is really good, but not the best. I bought this set and the Brainwave Symphony at the same time primarily so I could sleep on airplane red-eye flights.I found that the sleep CD in this set has some very slightly startling sounds that make me listen more actively than I want. Just when I'm about to fall asleep a fish jumps or a bird chirps and it catchs my attention. I keep not getting around to trying the other disks for other purposes.So, if you are just looking for an alpha-wave sleep inducing CD you might want to try something else before this set. If you are already familiar with this kind of relaxation music, and like new-age and natural sounds music, then this is a great set."
1,does not satisfy,"I was rather disappointed in this film -- it really didn't seem to offer anything new or insightful. Though I welcome Allen Estrin's obvious political position as his right, I would have been more happy if the film were more than just a series of things we already know about, told from an Israeli perspective. It might appeal to the so-called ""Israeli Left"", but not to US viewers who don't hold a personal stake in the Mid East conflict. Nothing to shout about."
3,Ineffective for Oral Thrush,"I purchased this product after reading a number of articles suggesting that tea tree oil mouthwashes might be helpful in cases of oral thrush. After daily use with this product, I saw no improvement. However, I only purchased one bottle, so I may not have given it enough time to have a meaningful effect."
2,Not very good,Veggie Tales have lost their touch. This just wan't very entertaining. My 8 year old was bored with it after the 15 minutes.
5,"Planet Hulk, certainly unique","Having never read the comic book, I have to say it helped to hear the audiocommentary and watch the special features. This is, however, a great story and I thought the way it was put together came across well on the screen. I didn't understand the Hulk from this movie, because in previous shows it was a screeming non-intellgent Hulk, whereas this one actually displayed non-angry personality. Overall, a great show and a good buy.Thanks for reading."
4,Worth a look,"Perhaps should be called Planet Hulk ""lite."" The book is always better and you become more sympathetic with the creators when they admit in the special features that they love the storyline, but can't commit to a six hour adaptation.Having seen the blu-ray first and then reading the source material, I'd definitely recommend reading the source material as the whole Planet Hulk universe makes more sense, and is more palatable, with the character depth and lingo that is presented.My only qualms with the blu-ray is that the colors don't quite pop they way they should for a blu-ray release, though some may say this is because of the muted color palate. You'll also notice some color banding after repeated viewings.Having said all this, I enjoyed the release."
2,The novelty of it was nice but a poor movie adaptation.,"I just rented this movie last night, in hopes it was good enough to purchase later. I'm sorry to say that it took too many short cuts and took out a lot of the underlining themes that made the comic books such a hit.As you know by this is this your typical Gladiator/Spartacus Hulk storyline where the Hulk finds himself a slave and must fight his way to freedom. Again a good theme but the execution of it was as if they were spiriting for the finish line and cut corners to do so.There were many inconsistencies such as: Hulk thinking as a Grey Hulk, Hulk using full sentences one moment then sounding like the green Hulk the next, or even how Hulk is bound to slavery with a disk which is so easily destroy in the ending scenes.I would equate this to DC's Superman: Brainiac Attacks. Marvel has done relatively well with the last couple of movies it would be nice if they tried to put some continuity into their movies but that's wishful thinking."
3,Meh,Positives :Lots of actionLots of BloodNegatives:Yet another Gladiator/Spartacus themed comic book movieThe Hulk talks in complete sentencessimple story and characters
3,Good,"This was a Fair Purchase...The movie was not riveting at all, and though it goes with the story of the comic...still it wasnt a good move for Marvel to ship its Strongest warrior off to a distant planet and now make him able to speak intellectually...people like the hulk cuz hes a beast but yet kind and not too educated...just knows right and wrong..still...The product was accurate and delivery date was as well....i give this user and its dependability 4.8/5I would purchase from this user again as well as recommend them to others, due to FAIRNESS in PRICING and INTEGRITY"
2,Planet Dull,"I suppose upon release this might have been a passably watchable movie,but cutting edge features from DC Comics (eg. Wonder Woman, Green Lantern,Batman: Under the Red Hood, and All Star Superman) and Marvel (The Avengers:The Earths Mightiest Heroes) have made this movie obsolete, almost painfulto watch. The animation is choppy, the character designs are too simple andrepetitive, the story is dull and predictable. Most of the characters aretired cliches (eg. the weak, sniveling, cowardly character who manages to ""find his courage""by story's end; the tough-as-nails-female fighter with the heart of gold and the troubled past).This isnt even the most appealing incarnation of the Hulk himself -- he's kind of a cross betweena brooding, introspective, birkenstock-wearing philosophy professor at Hofstra University,and a frontal lobe-deprived MMA fighter. Okie, thats a bit of a stretch, but you get the picture.This one is a definite pass, at this point not even worth a rental."
2,just didn't work,"i dont know why marvel cant get their animation line right. this was just not enough of anything to make it very good. the animation is mediocre. the story was stunted and choppy. the voice acting was often ridged or forced. i wanted to love this lke i loved the books, sorry to say i didn't. my 9 yo, who read the comics also, said ""ennn, it was ok. why'd they change it so much?"""
3,Not as good as the comic series,"After reading the comic series of the same name I thought that this would be a pretty good movie. This is actually not a bad movie, unless you have read the comic beforehand. It leaves out a lot of the story lines from the comic, so much so that it feels almost like a completely different story.I actually returned my copy because it didn't come with a digital version like the description said it would on Amazon and on the box pictured."
4,Planet Hulk,"Planet Hulk is a great film especially on Blu-ray bought this off Amazon because Australia never released it and its also Region B not just Region A. Though the image of the Blu-ray is a bit deceptive I thought I was getting a green Blu-ray case cause of the green bit up top of slick also it says digital copy and special edition but the one i got didn't come with a digital copy and it only said special edition up top. Other than that its a great animated film, cant wait to read the comics of planet hulk."
4,Decent movie 2nd disk is just a digital copy,"Product arrived quickly and In condition stated (all shiny new) the movie itself is ok not exactly comic accurate but close enough. The second ""bonus"" disk is just a digital copy of the movie so not really worth getting the two disk edition imo"
3,Get the book instead,"It's not a bad animated movie, but I enjoyed the book so much that my hopes were really high for this DVD. And I came away somewhat disappointed. So, I'd have to say, buy the Planet Hulk graphic novel instead.Incredible Hulk: Planet Hulk"
3,PLanet Hulk,I was dissapointed with all the needless changes in the movie from the actual story. If they followed it it would've been way better. To see Hulk visually destroying everything is impressive. I recommend Hulk Vs. Much better.
3,A Serious Hulk,"An enjoyable film. It gives a new dimension to the Hulk. This is not like his prior story lines, where he pretty much gets angry, smashes everything, and possibly mumble a few phrases. This is Hulk story line is more like the movie, Gladiator."
1,Mediocrity as an art form,"Greg Pak wrote what is arguably one of the best story-lines in the history of the Incredible Hulk. It's kind of like Conan meets John Carter from Mars, with the Hulk as the main character. It sounds like it wouldn't work, but it does. This animated movie managed to turn a fantastic storyline into a dumbed-down, choppy, poorly voice-acted version of a much better comic book. I honestly think the Ultimate Avengers movies were better. The best part of this was the cover artwork by Alex Ross. My suggestion? Watch it if it's on TV or something, but don't shell out the money. I regret paying for this DVD. I really, really do."
5,Entertaining,I was a good story line if you are not familiar with any hulk comics. My kids and I enjoyed it. The sound and visual were good. I would buy a similar product.
2,wtf were they thinking,"ok, lets say you never read the comic and have no clue as to this story line... then, and only then would this movie be good... otherwise WTF were they thinking?!?!?!?! it butchers a beautiful storyline and turns it into a shot story piece of crap... they loose so much depth as to who the charaters are, and who the hulk and and what he becomes. theres so much lost imagination put into the comic book in this movie it feels like a cliffnotes version. this movie should have been done in 2 or 3 movies and every line, scene, part of the comic should have been included... wtf were they thinking?!?!?!?!"
1,Hulk Not Good!,"If it were visually interesting, the utterly cliche ridden script might have been more tolerable. Maybe... Of course it was also filled with weird logic gaps. For example the gladiators are kept in line by tazer discs that shock them if they misbehave. Midway through the movie Hulk shoves a sword through Beta Ray Bills disc and shorts it out. If it were that simple, why didn't it happen in the first 10 minutes? Hulk himself is completely inconsistent. sometimes behaving like a mindless brute and sometimes calm and relatively intelligent. No explanation is given for why he never turns back into Bruce Banner. The other characters are either ciphers or (in the case of the bug-like Jar Jar Binks/Golllum character) gratingly annoying.The previous MARVEL direct to DVD efforts have been entertaining, this one not so much. Don't crash into Planet Hulk."
3,game probly fun but graphics horrible,I liked disciples 2 so this will probly be a good game if i can get over my attraction to the graphics of other similar games.
5,She's One Step Ahead Of The Rest!!,"I love Rhonda Vincent!She's the best thing about Bluegrass music and this gem of an album shows why.From the gorgeous ballads You Can't Take It With You When You Go,Caught In The Crossfire(about a child affected by their parents divorce),Missouri Moon and the single If Heartaches Had Wings.All amazing!As well as the cracking An Old Memory Found It's Way Back Again,the gospel classic Walking My Lord Up Calvary's Hill and the simply stunning Fishers Of Men-sung a cappella!!!This album is an essential for any Rhonda Vincent fan and any country music / Bluegrass fan...."
4,wish there were more.........,"...........more of rhonda's songs, that is. too bad it's relatively short.One Step Ahead is a terrific album with many songs to be played over and over including one with Allison Krause's harmony. enjoyed it more than ""All American Bluegrass Girl."""
5,Outstanding,I saw this group at the Grand Ole Oprey. They play excellent Blue Grass. Rhonda Vincent is a future star!
4,Gooder than snuff!,"As always, I really love the CD, and thoroughly enjoy her songs. One more for my collection of Rhonda's stuff!"
1,Spewings from a cultist,"Just more ramblings from an uneducated backwoods preacher who wants your money so he doesn't have to work for a living. Pray instead that he finds Biblical truth and abandons the hate-filled, cultic path he's chosen."
5,Dexpan,"Purchased this item to break a 1 foot thick concrete retaining wall. Bored 1 1/2"" holes as prescribed, mixed and poured the Dexpan. Thought it was useless after waiting 6 hour for it to starting breaking the wall, on the 7th hour cracks developed, the next day the entire wall had broken up. Be patient, this stuff works, sure beats renting an air compressor/jack hammer.. so much easier. With a 90lb jack hammer this wall would have taken a day to demolish. Pre drill with a 1"" bit, then with a 1 1/2"", drilling took 4 hours for about 60 holes. Follow the instructions, great stuffPaul Meiners"
5,Dope Breaks!,"What can I say? This CD is amazing. One of my best buys on Amazon. If you like your breaks hard and fierce, buy this album. Not many Breakbeat DJs know how to layer scratching as well as Madame Mercury. It's clean. Never is their a moment of, ""Argh, what the hell are they doing scratching now?! They're ruining this track!!""I've heard her live and this CD really captures her abilities. Madame Mercury tears it up!"
1,bizarre,"It was the first (and only) book of this author I bought so I cannot judge other readers' claim that the earlier books were better. With this book at least I could not relate at all. A modern days european, middle aged policeman who has never heard of Los Angeles? Who, reading that the city's name derives from an old Spanish mission expects L.A. to be a cosy european-style city inhabited by catholics? Has this man really never heard about riots, the movie ""colors"", OJ Simpson or Hollywood and should still be considered a credible character? A man who really thinks that, having started from Italy and landing after only three hours flight, he is in L.A. now (instead of Iceland)? This guy could have fallen from another planet, irreal as he comes over. Having read half the book, I just did not care anymore about his further destiny."
2,Not the best,"I read it and it was not great actually. Actually it was a long way from the ...unputdownable.... on its cover blurb.The hero is a Italian Detective Aurelio Zen who is hiding from the mafia who want to kill him. People about him start to die and the plot thickens.Anyway I waited and waited for the revelation but it didn't come. What happened was 174 pages of tripe. I waited for the humour, the paranoia that drips from each page but it never happened.This is one of a series, about number seven I believe and perhaps if I had been along from the beginning I might have got this but I don't think so.The feeling I got was that it was written to fulfill a contractual obligation because otherwise it is a waste of trees.If I read another one of this series it will be because it was a gift."
3,A coda,"This is the eighth in the Aurelio Zen series.It is really a coda - a ""what happened afterwards"" - to Blood Rain (my favourite in the series). I don't belive it stands alone at all, and would not suggest this as an entry point to the Zen series.However, if you HAVE read Blood Rain, then I suggest you do read it. Despite the initially sunny and carefree setting, Zen's demons are REALLY dark, and his sanity in question, as a result of events in Blood Rain.Fortunately, things are looking up for Zen by the end, but I have to say I was very disappointed in the plotting in the final section especially. Whereas Zen has previously used guile, subterfuge and some dubious, even 'shady' techniques for getting himself out of trouble, I felt the actions here were too crude and simplistic, and then more closely resembled farce than displaying any plot ingenuity.This was by far the most disappointing in the series for me, but I am glad that Zen is back!"
5,A long-awaited entry in a great series,"At last Aurelio is back, and better than ever! Aurelio Zen is one of my favorite characters and I heartily recommend ANY books in Michael Dibdin's series about this wonderful Italian ""just a common policeman."" Locales and backgrounds, as the stories move him around the country, are so richly drawn it's like traveling in Italy while having a great adventure. Plots are never simply black & white, but many layered, and the characters are complex. The previous entry (Blood Rain)caused tremendous consternation among my friends who are also fans: ""How could Michael Dibdin do it; do you think he really killed off Aurelio? Trust yourself to Mr. Dibdin's writing skill and climb aboard for great ride. We were so excited when the new book came out we didn't even plan to share copies; we each went out and bought our own--it was worth it. We hope Michael Dibdin is well-started on the next one."
3,Dazed and Confused,"I am an ardent fan of Michael Dibdin and our good friend, Aurelio Zen, and incredibly excited to find another book in the series. Zen lives!Having said that, I guess I just don't feel this one was quite up to standard (and a very high standard that is). In this book, Zen's adventures seem tongue in cheek. Diverted to Iceland? Criminalpol taken over by a guru of new management practices? Zen being put out to the pasture of ""working from home""?Although the book has elements of farce, now that we know Zen is alive, well and in love again, Dibdin is duty bound to keep 'em coming!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"i have read all the previous Aurelio Zen novels and found them well written with interesting plots that always contained at least a few clever twists. I was looking forward to this latest in the series, but I regret to say that I found it a great disappointment. There is a world of difference between a plot with twists and the wholesale substitution of improbable coincidences and bizarre characters for a plot. In the course of reading the book, I was tempted to put it down for good a half dozen times, but persevered because of my high opinion of the earlier books. I kept on hoping that somehow Dibdin would redeem himself, but the absurd coincidences and characters persisted until the end. It will be quite a while before I read another Dibdin novel."
4,The fairly Good CD,"The reason why I chose 4 stars instead of 5 is because I am not as familiar with the selections on here compared to CD 1 in this series. The perforformances on here are generally good, though I feel Harpsichord Concertos I was better."
5,Quite possibly sick enough to make you go nuts!!,"I am a dj and i listen to this kind of stuff all the time. so to make it quite clear i bought this album for three songs that i can't find anywhere else. track one:Follow Me [Lange Vs. DJ Jam & De Leon Mix] - The Morrigha. track two:D.A.Y.D.R.E.A.M.E.R. [Fridge Vs Vectrex Remix] - Daydreamer (which will blow you up so hard that you might just start crying from pure joy) and last but not least is track ten:In and Out [Signum Remix] and all the rest either [be really bad] or is mediocre. get this cd if you want to trip [out], but if you want the good melodic stuff just put the tree song s that i said on repeat and you should be alright"
3,"Soundalike ""uplifting"" trance","I'm sure this dj knows how to mix records and apparently he has acquired a devoted following, but listeners who are seeking anything original in a mix cd had best look elsewhere. This mostly is the same old cheesy ""uplifting,"" big-synth-and-snare-roll eurotrance that has become overexposed both in dance clubs and on mix cd's over the past couple of years. Fans of Tiesto, Corsten, and their ilk will probably like this, but people looking for something deeper, darker, and more progressive should pass."
1,Don't make the mistake i did,"This is not THE LITTLE RED BOOK. This is just a journal(yes a book with blank pages) with a picture of Mao on the front. I suppose if thats what you want go ahead and buy it, but i was confused and thought it was the journal of the chinese dictaor Mao, it is not.One more time, this is a journal with blank pages, not the book with the thoughts of Mao."
3,an ok notebook..,"Good quality paper, small and portable, most of the pages are lined with red dots, some have no lines, and between every few pages there are quotes from the Chairman (only 5 or 6 of these). I actually thought that it would have a more 'old' look but the cover is actually bright red and shiny.. A decent notebook but I don't highly recommend it.. unless you really love red.. or Mao!?!"
4,Poker chip racks,My only complaint is that I wish the bottoms of the holders were at an angle so the chips stay stack on top of one another. The bottom of these holders are perfectly parallel to the table and you always have to adjust the chips.
4,Almost perfect,"I did not like very much the style of the illustrations, but that is really subjective :) Any way - great book, great music, I enjoy it myself (and I am an adult! :)"
1,peter and the wolf,this was a joy to hear. the narration was the best i ever heard. the record was clean and clear. it is always a joy to deal with amazon. peter thoas
3,not what I hoped for,"Although this book has beautiful music and wonderful pictures, the retelling of the origional story is not very good. Many important elements of the story are changed. The wolf is released back into the wild because he says he is sorry and will try to change. I prefer the origional story and was not expecting changes such as this."
1,CD damaged and unplayable,"The book is beautiful and what we can hear of the CD is, as well; unfortunately the process used to afix the CD to the book's inside cover leaves gobs of glue on the CD, rendering it unplayable. We have had the product replaced twice, and both times experienced the same problem. A great disappointment!"
5,Brings back Memories,I loved this story as a child and was very pleased to find that my 3 year old nephew does as well. Very good for the imagination!
1,IT DOES NOT TELL YOU WHEN TO CHANGE THE PAGES,"I GOT THIS FOR MY SON, I LOVED THIS STORY WHEN I WAS A KID. IT DOES NOT TELL YOU WHEN TO CHANGE THE PAGES, SO IT DOE NOT WORK FOR HIM. I HAVE TO BE THERE TO HELP HIM CHANGE THE PAGES."
3,Too Expensive For What It Is,"I used to listen to this story as a child, and have very fond memories of it -- I remember being confused the first couple of times I listen to it because I thought it must have something to do with ""the boy who cried wolf,"" after all there was a boy and a wolf! I had probably come across that story not long before this one. This is a decent version, though the sales pitch at the end is disconcerting, and blares out soon after the story ends. I could enjoy a different telling and would have, except I thought that there would be some booklet wih this since that's what it looks like, right? The CD is packaged with a styrofoam sheet to make the package look more bulky, like maybe a booklet comes with it or something! Don't be fooled. There's nothing to this but the classic recorded short story, the box, and some styrofoam. And while it is the very one I listened to as a child, so it has a bit of nostalgia connected to it for me, it really is too much money for what it is."
3,"A for illustrations, D for text, B+ for audio narration","I agree that there is no reason to change the ending of the story and it is weaker for it. However, the illustrations are terrific, and I haven't been able to find many options for a Peter and the Wolf illustrated book that are not 'cartoon-ish'. The audio narration is also quite good so I'd give that a B+."
5,As much fun as a walrus with a parasol!,"Not only was this book very helpful, it was also very educational. The stickers look great on brown shoes. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of pirates (or not). The reading isn't too difficult either! A absolute must for parties. It will boggle your mind."
5,Great recording!,"This is a great recording of a little performed work. However, it may not be to everyone's liking, but to each his own. The Te Deum is probably the best track on the disc. The soloists are top notch, the orchestra is in fine form, and the choir sounds great. Recommending this recording!"
3,Re-packaged Recording,"This performance is fine, but it's been released several times before (I know, I have the other releases). There was no specific way to know that this recording was a re-issue, else I would not have purchased it."
1,just bought this book,"I just bought this book by mail at a closeout. I haven't tried any of the patterns, but the designs disappointed me. They look like they are from the 1970's. There is not one box in the book that inspired me enough to read the whole description or even consider going to the trouble of making it. I'm glad it was only five bucks."
3,estoy de acuerdo:.... no llega a la grandeza de ¿Cuando....?,"Pero sí, vale a pena.... también recomiendo ""Me Gusta Como Andas"": mas ""pop"", pero en mi opinión, muy bueno. (no puedo sacar de mi cabeza la imagen de los chochos voladores ja ja)Siniestro at their best can hold their own with The Clash and the Sex Pistols. Some of their classics (""Ayatolah"", ""Hoy voy a asesinarte"") can be found on the compilation ""Trabajar para el Enemigo"") but I'm still waiting for a collection that puts together only the most hardcore stuff. I had the pleasure of seeing this group perform in Seville in 1992, and - along with La Polla Records - they are one of my favourite bands from Spain."
2,no pasa mucho con Siniestro ahora!,"primero que nada me da gusto ver que alguien Peruano como yo este ofreciendo su opinion sobre en mi criterio el mejor grupo punk que ha existido en nuestro idioma, hablamos obiviamente de Siniestro Total, pero lo MEJOR de Siniestro fue ya hace muchos años, el Cuando Se Come Aqui? es indiscutiblemente el mejor material de Siniestro, canciones como Cobrador Loco y Te Tirare del Atico jamas han podido ser duplicadas o al menos se ha estado cerca de obtener ese ritmo punkeke que le rompe el craneo a cualquier persona, Coppini para mi fue lo mejor que le paso a Siniestro, lastima que solo duro para un album, pero como todo lo mejor, siempre hay poco, yo considero el Cuando Se Come Aqui de Siniestro a la altura del Never Mind The Bollocks de Pistols o la Novena de Beethoven, OBRAS MAESTRAS!!!! perupunk@yahoo.com"
2,"Rage and Mage rhyme, yay","I played this one online for a bit.Wasn't overly impressed with it though, it was something new so I went for it andwhile not terrible then, it is now.Another early upstart in the rpg's being pushed online though.The map building tool was fun, we exploited it to have massive in rushing monsterswith BA guards posted nearby that could slay them so we could easily level up.Definitely had entertainment value.If you played it now though you may be a little put out."
1,Doesn't Fit 2004 Toyota Matrix,"This part doesn't fit 2004 Toyota Matrix front wheel drive. It might fit the all-wheel drive model, but do not purchase this if you have the front wheel drive model"
2,Dragon Image Bleeds Through - Shoddy Material,"Even for the price this costume wasn't worth purchasing. The red dragon image smudges (yes...smudges) as soon as you touch it. It got all over me, my son's hands, and worst of all all over his shirt and pants. I tried to spot bleach the areas and it didn't get it out. I didn't even attempt to wash it because if it smudges I can't imagine what would happen if water actually touched it.Also, the stitching was terrible where black thread was used in some parts to stitch in areas (costume is white). Really bad and I'm a person who is not that picky especially when I paid so little. But even $10 wasn't worth this. If it can't be worn even once then what's the point :("
1,poor quality! a mess!,the red dye gets all over the white costume on its first use! costume was ruined before I even tried to wash it and did not improve in the wash. my boys loved it but did not get more than one use out of this! :/ booo!
5,A family of Ninjas,"An inexpensive costume for my 3 and 5 year old sons, my mom, and myself. NO, it's not the BEST fabric or quality but the boys love it!It's thin (the white is see through) and the pants tend to have a long ""crotch"" area. I nipped and tucked here and there w/ my super nonsewing skills and TaDah... we look awesome."
3,I've Purchased better,"It was a sloppy fit. Too many pieces and the hood was the worst part. I had to stitch the leg and arm ties on just to keep them in place. Velcro is what is used to supposedly keep the hood in place, but the hood is so baggy that it continued to droop off. I had to make alterations to tighten the hood a little... more work than what I wanted to do."
2,Cheaply made costume,"This costume is made from a super thin material and I'm sure won't last longer than Halloween night, the hood is not attached to the shirt thus leaving a gap around the neck and the mouth cloth is awkward to put on and tie.Although I'm not impressed with the quality, the price was low enough to consider this a ""use once and toss"" costume."
2,ninja costume,"purchased this ninja outfit for my son. He is into ninjago legos and wanted a ninja outfit. He wanted it to include a ""mask"" that covered his face. The pants and shirt in this outfit are fine but the mask portion of fabric will not stay on- falls right off unless it was tied too tight for comfort and durability. Then the maker of the product throws in a bunch of black pieces of fabric which are showed on the packaging. Well, these are ridiculous! They don't stay on at all so are a complete waste. The hood and mask a no go as well as all the black pieces of fabric. The pants are see through so childs underwear will show but pants and shirt are fun to wear around the house. Fine for the inexpensive price I suppose."
4,The Goddess In Me,I am still reading this book but am connecting to the various Goddesses as I amtaking notes and using this to see my many sides as described in length by the author. I have never been in touch with this area in my life but am now ready tolearn about the complex nature of some of the Goddesses and see how they relate to me today. Very interesting book.
4,Goddesses in Older Women,"thoughtful and provoking -- an academic description that gets a little detailed for the casual reader. Still, highly recommend to those who are studying Dr. Bolen's messages re. spiritual quests and journeys."
5,Empowering and Supportive for Older Women,"This is a good read for ageing women in our youth oriented society. Whether you ""believe"" in the idea of Goddess archetypes or not. The author dicusses various aspects which come into stronger focus as we age, and encourages women to be aware of them. The idea is to foster strengthening those aspects which are helpful, and to be aware of any negative attributes of an archetype, in order to overcome them. I found this book to be very nurturing, for its fresh perspective on the great things about ageing. Kate Boswell MFT"
4,An amazing melodic gift,"Ferenc Erkel was the Hungarian analog of Mikhail Glinka: the founder of a national school of music. His melodic gift rivals that of Bellini, and his dramatic sense is worthy of comparison to early Verdi. Bank Ban is packed with music that would become greatest hits, but for the isolation forced by its Hungarian-language text. The performance is first-rate; Ferencsik was a masterly conductor and most of the singers are world-class. Alas, Jozsef Simandy, a great heroic tenor, was well past his prime when the recording was made, and his singing is often effortful. But don't let this fact deter you from trying out this masterpiece, relegated by language to undeserved neglect."
4,A great Opera.,I've saw this opera in Budapest in Oct. 2006. It was fabulous on stage and I can't wait to hear the entire recording.
2,You may NOT get what you order.,"Product is fine, fit fine. The reason for ""2 stars""? I did not get what I ordered.Here is what the seller said to me when I got a BLUE and WHITE unattractive ironing pad cover, when clearly the order was for Cotton Fields! And there is a drop down menu to order from indicating what PATTERN is desired! From Seller: ""We have not mentioned the colour of it. The picture is only for the identification of the product not to ensure the colours."" Sure, they offered to take it back, but the time and expense of sending back such a small item? Not worth it. Will not order from them again. Not happy.here is the link from SELLER's email to me - while saying ""colors not mentioned""[...]"
4,Is the pocket necessary,"This is a lovely ironing cover, but the iron cord hangs on the utility pocket. It would probably work well for a left-handed ironer, however. If you're right-handed, plan on removing the pocket."
5,I abuse my ironing board pad...this one's great,"I'm forever glueing, stitching, and ironing and crafting items on my ironing board... this one's is great with the measurements e directly accessible. The pad is just the right thickness too so that you can get a nice crisp edge to a fold as well as smooth finish to straight ironing. If the pad is too thick you cannot get a crisp edge to a fold when you are ironing thicker fabrics (canvas, heavy cotton, etc.)...This one is perfect."
2,A lot of errors in this book,"First of all, do not buy this book if you are expecting to understand how to be a good NT administrator. This book is only good for passing an exam. Don't get me wrong, if you are only buying a book to prepare for an exam, this is an ok purchase. However, if you are wanting to be a good administrator and an MCSE, then you would assume that you don't need a dummies book anyway. This book has a lot of errors which only get worse when coupled with the extremely flawed ""flash cards"". My advice is to read braindumps as this is all you are paying for. If the content was deeper and the errors less, this would be a good book. I don't dislike the dummies series of books, but if you take one thing away from my post it should be this, always buy one other book as well - if you're buying the dummies. It will help account for the errors and lack of detail you receive when reading dummies."
3,"Good sound, a little bit repetative","Like many English-language people, I first heard this band's song ""Kiri"" when it was used as the opening to the anime series Ergo Proxy. While the rest of the album is very professional and the lead singer's voice is very good, I don't find that the lyrics resonate with me in the way that Kiri does. It's not a bad album, but I couldn't pick out another song on the album that I would consider particularly memorable. Also their style doesn't have a lot of variety to it, so I got a bit bored by the end of the album."
1,people i know,"While watching this movie, I heard an assortment of cool recognizable songs . The soundtrack was dominated with original uninteresting music. Preview all soundtracks before you buy them."
2,"Great paper, but arrived damaged.","If you have an epson printer and are printing photographs, you should definitely use epson's photo paper and ink. The prints come out great! Unfortunately, Amazon's packaging wasn't very good and some of the sheets had damaged corners. Amazon's packaging has been bad on other orders I've made in the past so I won't buy printer paper from them again."
1,do not buy this from amazon/wasted packaging,"I ordered four packages of the same paper, all of which were shipped individually as separate orders. A total waste of packaging materials.And this was for free shipping... someone is making unnecessary money off this"
1,"Sent Wrong item, slow to communicate",Beware of this seller! I was sent the wrong item. This seller is very hard to communicate with and did not respond to my requests for over a week. They did not offer to replace with the correct item and have a very slow return and refund system. Also I had to pay return shipping and hope they would reimburse me after the fact.
1,Does not work well with HP,I read the reviews. Tried the Epsom Paper. The photos were bland and without the vibrant colors and depth I got with the more expensive HP Photo Paper. Truly disappointing.
4,Retail price has to be an error on Amazon,This is great paper...but I don't know where Amazon gets that this normally retails for one hundred dollars. That is just not true. It must be a type error. the retail is what Amazon is actually charging.
5,Highest quality and makes ink waterproof!,"I'm a professional graphic artist, and I've used this paper for about 10 years since I purchased my first Epson printer. It produces, by far, the highest quality photographic images over every paper I've used including Kodak, Canon, HP, and Kirkland papers. So what sets it apart? (and makes it more expensive?) This paper has a chemical coating on the surface that sets inkjet dye virtually on contact. So prints on Epson photo paper are smudge-free and able to be handled right out of the printer. The chemical is why you have to store this paper in its self-sealing pouch until use, because it will otherwise evaporate. But what most people don't know, is that it also makes inkjet dyes nearly waterproof. I've actually run a print under the faucet, and when it dried, it was completely unharmed. On other papers, the print was destroyed. This might not seem that important, but it makes your prints resistant to fingerprints and accidental spills."
5,Impressive!,"I can't get over how great this paper is! It outperformed the other brands I'd tried, including Kodak and Canon. Since my printer is a Canon MP610, one would assume that Canon paper would give the best results, right? Nope! This Epson paper blows it away. Crisp, vivid, streak-proof, dries instantly, and the images are durable. It also has a nice weight/thickness to it. It makes your photos seem like pro quality. I love it and I love the price! I don't think I'll ever use anything else."
3,"It's OK, but no better than the Kirkland brand glossy paper","On a Canon 4300 printer, and comparing side to side with several prints, I could not tell any difference in 8X10 photo prints between this paper and the Costco (Kirkland) paper. None. Same gloss level, same detail and color hues, and if I mixed them up on the table, I bet nobody could tell the difference. Remember, this is the high gloss premium, not Epson's next step up. I haven't tried that one yet, but I will."
5,Great photo paper at a good price,I bought this paper for use in my new Epson Artisan 837 all-in-one and I'm very pleased with the results. Definitely lab quality in my opinion and the price here on Amazon is very fair.
5,"High Quality, Quick Drying Photo Paper - Highly Recommended!","The Epson High-Gloss Premium Photo Paper is very high quality inkjet paper that produces fantastic looking, smudge resistant prints from myEpson Stylus Photo 2200 Inkjet Printer.This paper is very quick drying so prints can be stacked without worrying that they will stick together. I also like that it is fairly heavy stock so prints have the feel of professional lab quality.Highly Recommended!"
1,bad product,this is the worst paper for making photos. it left images purple. i used canon without a problem and bought this as it was 8 x 10. big mistake
5,Epson papers are the best. Sorry that the shipping is not.,I receive a lot of things that I purchase on line and I have never seen anything packed so poorly.One of the packages had been tossed around so much in this huge box that it was open!
1,Poor Quality paper-disappointing for Epson,"Bought the Epson Artisan 810 this summer after owning a Cannon for many years. I still had some Cannon paper to use up - all was printing fantastic quality. Once the Cannon paper was almost gone, decided to order the Epson paper - as is recommended. I thought something was wrong with the ink, with the printer - faint lines across every picture. I put a couple sheets of the cannon back in that I had and it printed perfect, floorless pictures. DO NOT BUY THE EPSON PAPER! The printer is fabulous, the paper is horrible. Buy Cannon paper."
1,Didn't work in our printer,"The photos we printed with this paper had an awful blue cast. Followed instructions, this was a bad experience! Do not recommend for the Artisan 50 Printer, especially if using remanufactured ink..."
5,"Epson S041727 Premium Gloss Photo Paper (4x6, 100 Sheets)",Very good quality paper and prints from Epson PictureMate. Don't risk using lesser quality paper. You will be very happy with this product. Amazon has better price than BestBuy.
4,This I buy by price.,"Since I've learned that it really is important to use Epson ink in Epson printers, I use theirpaper as well. My wife likes glossy and thinks four star is good enough---so that's what I buy.I do shop around for the best price. I've never had a bad box."
5,My pictures look great!,"I recently bought an Epson C82 printer and I am very pleased with what it could do but my photos weren't looking as good as I thought they could on the heavy weight matte paper. I tried using the Kodak glossy paper that I had left over but was rather disapointed so I decided to check out the Epson brand paper after reading some of the postive reviews here. It really does make a huge difference! I used to think using the same brand paper as the printer was a bunch of company hype. Not true with Epson, especially with their Dura Brite ink. I am sticking with this photo paper as long as my printer keeps working!"
1,Watch Them,They advertised the Premium Glossy Paper Part # SO41290 for sale. However they shipped the less expensive Photo Glossy Paper Part #SO41156. This is false advertising and a rip off.Update 10/30/09Computer Brain gave me a $15 credit as compensation for their error. They stated on the phone that they no longer have the Premium Glossy in stock but I see they are still selling it here!!!!!!
5,Amazing!,I am using this paper in my Canon I850 and get just as good of results as I do with the twice as expensive canon photo paper pro. I would strongly urge everyone to try this paper. The quality of prints are equal to the canon papers and much better than the kodak or other brands.
3,not really glossy,"i just bought a new epson workforce 600 printer and this 4x6 film paper. it says 'premium glossy'. however, when i printed a photo it looked like a matte finish. the quality is still very good. but i was dissappointed that it was not reall glossy."
2,1+1+1=try again,"I HATE to have to write a bad reveiw, but the songs that are on SOLO are just not catchy tunes. The lyrics are as deep and introspective as I expected, but the music was lacking. I applaud the guys for trying hard NOT to sound like dctalk, but their efforts came up a little short. Tait is the highlight of the cd, but the songs sounded like grammatrain+michael tait; decent, but unoriginal. KMax's songs were done in a techno-dance-over-the-top-artistic fashion that was almost insulting. Toby gave an AWESOME effort in ""Extreme Days"", but the attempt to old-school rap over a turntable and a loop were...well...white. I hope that the guys have much success with their solo efforts; but, even more than that, I hope they continue with dctalk."
4,Oh No! The DC Talkers Are Going SOLO!,"This album starts of with a very good version of 40 (live!). (9 of 10)Tracks 2 &3, Alibi & All You Got, Come from Tait's album Empty. (8 of 10)Tracks 4 & 5, Return of the Singer, Be, Come from Kmax's album Stereotype Be. (10 of 10)Tracks 6 & 7, Somebody's Watching Me, Extreme Days, Come from Tmac's album Momentum. (9 of 10)While there is only one ""new"" song on this album, it serves as a good last fairwell for hardcore dc fans. The rest kind of serve as a sampler for the group's first solo projects."
5,Great to see that there is still life after DC Talk.,I look forward to all the upcoming solo releases. I think all three members and their fans (including myself) have alot to look forward to in the next few years.
2,No real connection,I have to admit this band just dont cut it for me they sound as if they intromit too often and too much until whats left is the result here of a very boring band.
4,Promising material,"I bought this when I went to see dc Talk in concert, their last tour before splitting. I liked it, and it made me go and buy all their solo albums (Toby's being the best). Worth a listen, or just go buy the three solo albums they recorded."
3,Give it a chance,"Most reviews of this book were to say the least bad. I however enjoyed it. it was what I like to call brain candy. YOu don't have to think hard to read it. You just enjoy it. If you like Andre Norton's works, this is not her best effort, but it is a fun and quick read to pique further interest into scifi/fantasy reading for someone just starting to develop a taste for it. BTW, I wouldn't reccommend this for a guy. This was definitely a chick book."
4,Very Good Book! I loved it.,"This was a really good book, Twilla and Ylon are both strong characters. I enjoyed the way she (Norton) described the castles of forest and underworld. It was good enough for 5 stars by almost any other author's standards. I think the Witch World series topped this, but just barely."
1,A Painful Experience,"It was only through a great act of will that I was able to make it through this book. The characters are flat, the story is predictable, and the rhymes scattered throughout are the worst in recent memory. I would not recommend this book to anyone, except possibly to convince them that if this book can get published then so can theirs!"
2,This book needs help.,"Although, the underlying story was interesting and creative, I found the writing of the story wanting. The diaglogue seemed forced and inconsistent. In addition, there were many redundancies and just plain poorly written segments. I am an avid fantasy fiction reader and have read many different books by many different authors. I truly enjoyed the basic premise of the book and its main character and that is why I finished it. But I found it an unenjoyable experience and am disappointed that it was such."
5,A Chess Instructor's Dream,"Excellent!!!! This book helped me through teaching a two week course on chess for summer school. The kids were in grades 2-4. This serves as a help for the question, ""What do I teach next?"" and as a guide for curriculum. Nice nice nice! Definitely worth the purchase to improve your game. I learned a few things and I've been playing chess for 5 years. Excellent!"
2,Some Good Points Covered - But Lacking in Many Others,"I found this book to be a major disapointment. Math in the classroom is certainly one aspect of chess that this book covers. What about how chess works on reading skills through pattern recognition? How about actually covering in detail the actual lesson plans that a teacher should use over an entire program? And, finally how do you make it fun for the kids in the classroom (boring and dry doesn't do it!).[...]"
2,Kid's Textbook,My parents suggest I write this when I was given this at a local chess program as a book for me. It is a book for the teacher first and is not written for me being in the 4th grade. It has some more or less sample stuff but not lessons set up in a workbook or problems to solve like kids like. When it was to be part of a class I was to take and it is the book more for a teacher then I had my mom say write about it on amazon to say so.
3,Decent Book For the Classroom Teacher,There are several good and several weak attributes for and against this book. Overall it is a decent book for a classroom teacher to use who wants some ideas on how to approach teaching chess and some ideas on methods to do this. Some of the methodology suggested is excellent. [] certainly this is not a book for a young student. A couple of suggestions are flawed and do not work very well in practice (I know this from years of teaching chess myself). This book will not replace using a couple of solid books containing more extensive lessons plans at the beginning and intermediate levels. But it can be a valuable book to give you ideas along with getting these other books. Perahps the author will write a solid book with step by step lesson plans to go along with this one - if done and complimented by this (or any other book that would accomplish this) then I would have considered a four star rating.
4,Absolutely WORTH the Watch!,Bruce Marciano is a humble man who definitely portrays the love of Christ! This movie addresses people as we are and gives HOPE in this day of trouble and adversity! Take time to view; you will not be sorry! We are glad we purchased and plan to share it with many!
5,Definitely a five-star movie !,"Buy this movie for someone you care about this Christmas. Especially if they are questioning their faith in any way, or are new to faith. We got this from Netflix, but when the credits were rolling, my husband said ""We've got to own this movie....go buy it."" And I did !"
5,Awesome movie,"This was a captivating movie about a chance encounter with Jesus Christ. All of the characters came from different walks of life, yet Jesus knew all about them and knew where they needed the most help. I loved the compassionate, approachable, yet unwavering stance taken in the portrayal of Jesus. I would recommend this movie as a great give to an unbelieving friend. Also great movie for any believer that wants to see the heart of Christ in action."
4,Great Wholesome movie answering the tough questions,"I loved the encounter on so many levels. How Jesus knew every one of them, their deepest secrets and why they refused him or wouldn't let him in wholeheartedly. What stuck with me the most was the fact that the woman, Helen, with her husband Hank, that she believed or thought she was a ""Christian"" and Jesus told her she was not! Yes, she may have been a Sunday School teacher and walked up to the altar and said a few words, went to church every Sunday, but never truly repented for her sins. Lastly, the ending, what happened to one of the people who didn't want what Jesus was offering.Adrienna TurnerAuthor of ""The Day Begins with Christ"""
4,Heavy message,"This movie was on the lines of an old Hitchcock movie. There were about five different families with problems of the worldly type,and Jesus was running the small isolated dinner. The gospel was shared with each one and some rejected while others accepted....sounds familiar doesn't it?"
5,Great movie!,"""The Encounter"" is a great Christian movie that gives an idea of what it would be like to meet Jesus in our world today. It shows His deep love for all kinds of people, shows how He knows everything and uses circumstances in our lives for a purpose. I'd highly recommend it for anyone wanting to know more about who Jesus is, or people going through difficulties, unsure of the direction of their lives."
4,Encounter review,I was pleased that this dvd was in great shape and all that it said it would be. I was dissappointed however that paying for expedited shipping it still took two weeks for me to recieve the dvd. Just be honest as to the time of delivery. I had a program planned for the church. I would have been elated with my order if I had recieved it at least within a week. This to me is false advertisement. A range of a week is rediculous.
2,Shaky Camera Work,Message good but camera work is horrible. Tend to get sea sick with all of the jerky camera work.
1,very weak!,Poor acting! Fell asleep during the movie . Definitely would not view again. Thought it would be better. Thank you!
1,"Junk. Bad story, acting and direction","I don't dislike this just because it's cheaply made. It's just pure junk. As if the bible itself doesn't tell a bad enough story, you've got a rip off (and a bad one) of Needful Things and a sprinkling of ""Jesus"". Junk. Pure junk."
5,Awesome Movie!!,"What an awesome and powerful movie! You will want to want to watch it again and again! Very thought provoking! Everyone can relate to one of the characters struggles. This is a must see! This movie has touched our lives! This movie draws you into it from the beginning straight through to the end! It continues to remind you of what an awesome, loving, God we have! You will be blessed!"
5,My faith has increased and I am encouraged because of this film.,"This film was scriptually sound and did much to increase my faith and increase my trust in Jesus. It is perfect for the saved and the unsaved as a wonderful witnessing tool. Thank You, Lord, for giving us this film and the actors/actresses therein!! I cannot speak highly enough of this film!!"
5,Outstanding,"I highly recommend this for families to watch together - it is suspenseful and entertaining, while at the same time delivering a very powerful message of unconditional love. What an excellent alternative to all the vulgar movies and television shows that have become so ubiquitous in our society!"
5,Awesome story line!!!,"I was really impressed with this movie and the story line. It flowed really well was one of the better movies that tell us how God really feels about us. I have seen other ones that have tried to do this but they really were not very believable and this one does not pull any punches, it spells it out they way it is. I would highly recommend this as a witnessing tool which I very rarely do with a movie. Would also be good for new believers."
5,HELPFUL WITH UNANSWERED QUESTIONS,"My husband lost his father one year and his brother the next year. He pleaded with God not to take his brother away when we found out he was taken in for heart attack. Although we are both solid Christians, he had his doubts and questions when his brother died. He was really angry with God but after watching this movie his anger and frustrations turned into hours of brokenness. Needless to say, he felt such a relief and thought his questions were legitimate but most importantly found some answers that came out from this movie. Thanks for investing time and money in making great display of the truths such as this movie."
2,Encounter,It is just ok. It was rated higher by other people but it was slow and choppy. We will give it away.
3,it was ok,"no problem with the order, came just as expected. The movie was just ""ok."" It has a good story line just a little slow getting into it."
4,Great CD but...,This is a great Guy Clark CD except that the last song (#15 Texas Cookin) is flawed. Amazon allowed me to download it again but I had the same problems. I am confident that it will be fixed and I will get song 15 eventually. I would highly recommend the CD after it is fixed.
1,Worst USB drive ever,"If I could give it zero stars I would. I've never in my life seen a thumb drive that causes so many problems, and I've owned over a dozen of them. This company has found a way to take a wonderful invention and make it a nightmare by adding in their little application that is not worth using. Everyone I know who has one of these had to format it, and had to go to the web to find out how. What a hassle. I'll never buy another one."
4,Awesome price and memory!,"Pros: great price, great memory,switch back function, and U3cons: made very cheaply,"
3,Just hope if works out of the gate,I ordered 20 of these at the same time. One of them was defective and it was a major issue to get it replaced. For an item that has a lifetime warranty why do I have to exchange at least 5 emails before getting an RMA? The next to last email requested the color of the packaging before they would issue an RMA.
2,1 out of 4 didn't work,One of the micro cruzers worked one time and after that... nothing. I won't buy this again.
4,Great!,So useful and portable! Love the capacity and the small size! comes with a small ring so you can attach it to your keychain. The plastic housing seems rather flimsy and would not tolerate the most extremes of physical hardship. The U2 or U3 software it comes with is not compatible with older computers. My mother's older Dell with Windows 98 cannot even read this drive even without the U2 software.
4,"Great hardware, aggravating software.","The SanDisk Cruzer series has been good to me. I have the 1GB model, and when I needed some more mobile storage and saw the 4GB model on sale, I jumped at the chance. Functionally, it's the same great flash drive with more room for files. People also love the sliding retractable port, for silly reasons.My only complaint is the U3 software that's embedded on the drive is marginally useful, and usually just plain annoying. It's buggy and sluggish, and doesn't add much to what should be a simple device for transferring files. Uninstalling the U3 software is a chore, despite attempts to make it look easy.I'd certainly buy another Cruzer, and I likely will when 4GB doesn't cut it, but I'll be sure to research the U3 software next time."
5,Seems flimsy but works okay.,"Pros--4gb gives lots of room, the u3 lets me run my bookcollector/libray software on multiple computers so I can track my many books at work and home, including those I lend to other folk. No cap to lose is great.Cons--nothing serious so far. The thing's a bit flimsy feeling, but has not broken, seems to be mostly plastic, but oddly, that makes me treat it gently so I probably will not break it. No lanyard comes with it, but there's a ring to slip one through if you feel the need.Overall, it's good enough that I'm considering getting the 8gb size soon."
2,Can't get keychain on...,"The reason I got this one over others was because it had a keychain hook, but it came without a metal ring on it. I tried to fit my smallest rings on with no success. Fortunately it's a decent 4 GB hard drive, but just not as portable as I want it..."
1,Unwanted software loaded on drive,"I've had this product for over a year now and rarely use it because it is inconvenient and a hassle to use. All I want is a jump drive that I can stick into a USB port and use, thats it. Without getting technical, this item has extra software loaded on it so that it requires TWO open drives on your computer to be fully functional (i.e. I needed an F: drive and a G: drive in order to use this on my home computer) When I tried to use this at work it failed because most of the drives on my work computer are in use. Consequently I was unable to use this item without totally reassigning my drive mappings which is a pain to do. Therefore, I have an old PNY 1 GB that I use now because it is hassle free and plug and play. No pre-loaded software, no extra drives, no problems."
2,"Hate the continious flashing (""breathing"") light effect!!!","I have used Sandisk usb devices and think that they are great. I like the retractable plug and the sleek design. I have several usb's that are a year old that the light stays on unless transferring data, the new one's apparently (according to sandisk)all ""breath"" when idle. I personally cannot stand the new ""breathing"" light effect. I find it to be distracting while pluged into my laptop especially in darker rooms. There is no way to stop this ""breathing"" and according to an e-mail from Sandisk they are quite happy with their new design change. I returned the one I just bought and will be trying Kingston next time."
2,U3 is terrible,"Can't stand the U3 stuff; why do manufacturers keep wanting to shove software down our throats? The U3 stuff causes a delay in loading and it's an awkward interface for software that you don't really want/need anyway. The Kingston 4 GB USB drive is selling on amazon for $17 right now, so that's a better deal. If SanDisk offered this same product without U3, it would probably deserve a 4- or 5-star rating. U3 is really useless."
3,Does the Job,"This SanDisk does the job, but doesn't always transfer files well. It has it's glitches, so I don't know if I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Not as advertised.,"This is a U3 Flash Drive. This is important information which was not included in the seller's description. I had to do a Google Search to find a removal tool for unwanted and space wasting U3 software from this drive. The construction is flimsy, being very poor quality plastic. The slider is also not well constructed. I was afraid the drive would break every time I plugged it in or pulled it our. Definitely not what I had in mind when I saw the brand name SanDisk. That company can do much better. But as a Gift Certificate buy, these drives are not the worst thing I could have selected.Overall, you can do much better with other models/ brands."
4,OK product,"the flash memory itself seems to be OK, but than again there is no real way of telling in advance, since by definition flash memory is a very reliable product. the main differences between the manufacturers are the outer cover and/software. with this product, the plastic shell fills cheap, and retrospecting, I would have added the additional 7$ or so and get the titanium model. at least there is a 2 year warranty. the U3 software is really nice, and actually upgrades the unit from simple storage level to an almost portable PC. I only wish that there would be a free U3 anti virus. this is a basic tool on this kind of product (helping friends and family recovering their PC and so on). there is a free portable anti virus (clamshell), but it is not U3 compatible."
4,Nice product. U3 is a plus,"Nice product, I love the retractible USB plug (no lost caps anymore!).I am not using the U3 functionality, although it could be useful."
4,Good size on key chain,"I wanted a simple USB drive to attach to my key chain. This one has the right size and the retrievable head works well. No plastic caps to mess around. The software is very annoying though. It's also embarrasing to use it on friend's PC. ('Gee, you installed something on my PC!') You can not remove it by delete/format. After downloading that removing tool it's completely gone. I am happy now."
3,Seems fine,"Small size, large capacity, no cover to lose. Plastic case perhaps a bit flimsy compared to the titanium ones they also make. Package requires locksmith skills to open up, quite frustrating. Who needs the U3 stuff, also?"
5,Great for all those things you want to carry around,This is just the way to carry around all the little utilities you cannot live without and that spare file you just might need.
5,Great product,"Love it - it's compact, light and very affordable. I bought it a month ago to back up all my files so that I could reinstall my operating system when my computer had some weird virus. Now I keep all my picture files on it and my computer runs a lot faster. I also back up all my files (learned my lesson before it was too late!) I highly recommend this cute little flash drive.7/30/08 Update: Still love it. And I LOVE that it's retractable - stays protected when not in use and no parts to lose! (Things tend to get lost in the abyss that is my computer room!)"
2,It broke.,It broke. It no longer lights up and cannot store information. Maybe I just got a defective one: I don't know.
2,Get the titanium,"This is a flimsy flashdrive. Works well enough, mind you, but do yourself a favor and invest in the titanium cruzer. And note that it doesn't come with a strap."
2,Sabdisk US software locks up often,"It is really cool having a small 4GB thumb drive - I just wish the SanDisk US software worked more reliably. It frequently locks up access to the drive. Just now as I was writing this review, I put the SanDisk drive into the USB 2.0 port on my WIn Xp SP2 computer to refresh my memory as to the problems, and it aborted my IE application and I had to start all over with the review. I am considering re-formatting the drive so I can use it as just a USB drive although I will lose the occasional benefit (when it works) of the U3 functionality. Otherwise it was a wast of mone - it is too small to use as a paperweight..."
1,Great... while it lasted.,"I loved the retractable connector, software was great, etc. But it died with no warning after just 28 days."
1,Ripped Off,"The packaging should clearly state,""This usb comes with annoying and only marginally functional software that you cannot delete."" My girlfriend (the gift recipient of this item) has to use Mac and IBM interchangeably daily, and even though the packaging says Mac compatible the sandisk product support site says the following:SUPPORT FAQ QUESTION:Mac users: I recently purchased a Cruzer Micro with U3 and when I plug it into my Macintosh I get an Untitled CD and a Launchpad.exe icon on my desktop that cannot be deleted. How can I delete these files?SUPPORT FAQ ANSWER:WARNING: Cruzer Micro with U3 is not compatible with Mac.Thats it Sandisk, I'm never buying another one of your products. I feel this was deceptive and shortsighted.Don't buy it. Even if it is cheap it is still overpriced."
1,"Worst drive ever, Sandisk support just as bad","Do yourself a favor, do not risk your money on this flash drive. It works reasonably well (very slow) as a flash drive, once you remove the U3 software. That is, IF you can remove the U3 software. And if you need assistance removing the U3 software, you can call Sandisk Support. IF you get someone who understands the English language, you MIGHT eventually get the U3 software removed. Oh, and if the U3 software is why you bought the drive in the first place, tough luck. Sandisk will not offer you a refund because technically the drive is working, even though the drive causes an error whenever you eject it. Do yourself a favor, there are a lot of alternative flash drives. Don't risk your money on this one. If you do decide to risk your money, good luck if you ever need support from Sandisk."
2,Flimsy.,"So far I've owned three Cruzer Micros: 256MB, 1GB, and 4GB, and the quality has steadily declined. The 256MB was encased in 1/16"" of hard rubber on all sides, you could step on it without breaking it, and it felt like it was even waterproof (never tried :) The 1GB (with soft rubber ""Skins"") unit was about the same size, but the three skins degraded to shreds in a year in my pocket with keys rubbing them. Luckily the naked brushed-metal Cruzer looks great and doesn't scratch. The 4GB model is even bigger than the original 256MB one but this time has a cheap plastic exterior, and the LED is on only one side (the sliding panel glows) instead of on the end like the previous models. Guess which direction it faces when I plug it into the handy USB plug on my monitor? You guessed it. Away from me! I popped the case off, and the insides are exactly the same size as the 1GB model. They need to go back to the original casings which deserved the name ""Micro""."
2,It was great when it worked... only 3 months,"I was really happy with the performance of my 4 GB unit, with or without the u3, you can get used to it and actually find a use, it's a good idea that needs just a few tweaks.The problem here is that it workded only for 3 months of average use. I reported the problem to sandisk and they gave me a terrific service and in less than 48 hours I already had my shipping label to send them back the unit and get an additional one.I would wait a little longer if this is your first time just to make sure they have fixed all the bugs."
2,Not for ReadyBoost,I bought the SanDisk 4GB to boost my PC through ReadyBoost. The advertising indicated that it was good for ReadyBoost. However when I inserted it in my PC a message appeared that it was not fast enough to enable any improvement via ReadyBoost. I still use it for memory back up but I feel as though I was misled.
1,Did Not Work,"I've had a lot of flash drives and this is the first one that wouldn't work. Errors, doesn't copy data, maybe it's a conflict with the preloaded software."
3,"Good hardware, terrible software.","Why would you take a simple product that everyone in the world knows how to use and screw it up royally by adding this U3 software? I was giving a talk at a conference recently and needed to print my outline at the hotel and this thing failed to work in THREE PCs. Of course it took forever because I had to wait for the software to start up, then fail, in all three. Do not purchase this thing unless you 1. Like headaches, or 2. Are savy enough to figure out how to remove the software they added (you can't just delete it)."
4,the products SANDISK are very goods,The pendrive is excellent in relation to its capacity and the information contained in him; Very useful at the time of keeping much information. My negative point is that the connector is something exposed to that him between sweepings or small remainders. The factory would have to consider it in the future.
3,U3 is cool. Flashing LED Annoying,"First Big Note: If all you want is a USB drive for storage DO NOT buy U3 enabled technology.The Bad First: There is a flashing LED that is beyond annoying. It is large (3/8"" x 1/2"")! I have to cover it up each time I use it which is a pain. I took 2 stars off just for this.The Good: If you compute on more than one computer, or use other computers, U3 enabled technology can be great as it allows you to carry software along with your files. Such packages like OpenOffice (Office Suite that will open Word, Excel, Powerpoint docs), FileZilla (Ftp client), Skype, Avast Anit-Virus, Foxit PDF Reader, Opera and Firefox browsers can be downloaded and installed for free from u3.com. I am a developer and also bought a version of UltraEdit for $40 that runs on U3.I paid $10 + S/H through Amazon.PS - SanDisk...lose the flashing LED...What were you thinking?"
1,delivery in April 2008,"Availability: In Stockorder date Nov. 10delay note received on Nov. 21,espected delivery date: April 2008What does ""In stock"" mean for Amazon and Sandisk?"
3,Sandisk 4 GB Cruzer,"Thumbdrive has preloaded software on it that I felt was hard to use and if you tried to upload or download from a computer that did not have the ""Cruzer's"" software on it... it did not reconize the drive."
1,"Requires ""High Power USB Hub Port""","This device will not work in most laptops. It is useless for the purpose for which I purchased it. Now I have to purchase and powered port, and cannot use the ""Cruzer"" without a wall plug. I do not see this requirement stated anywhere in the specs."
2,Software Is Horrible,"This is a great thumb drive, but with a built in disaster. The U3 software might seem handy. But if you use it it soon reveals that it is crippleware. You have to pay $25 to get a 'rull function' version. THEN, if you decide to remove it, it keeps reinstalling itself, just like a virus. I would AVOID this product at all costs."
2,Beware -Do not try to remove the U3 Software!!!,"I purchased a 1GB Cruzer months ago and a 4GB Cruzer today. I originally didn't know what the U3 option was but I figured it wouldn't hurt having it. It is extremely annoying when you're using a Mac, as someone pointed out, you can do anything with the U3 on a Mac but you do get the useless CD icon.This morning I read the comments where someone said you can remove the U3 from the SanDisk website so I decided to try it. I carefully followed the prompts only to watch in horror as it deleted the U3 program BUT it also deleted all my files!!! I immediately called SanDisk customer support who told me the only thing they could do was to offer a $150 U3 software that may or may not find my lost files.If I ever find the guys that created the U3 option, especially the removal software I'll give them a real piece of my mind."
4,Nice.,"The Nazty North compilation gives us a taste of P Family Records' solid roster of Minnesota and Chicago underground artists, to overall good results.The album succeeds nicely in showcasing many different styles - toungue-twisting, club / bounce, hardcore, and meaningful. All of which maintain that North Coast sound that Midwest rap is known for.The album's production, handled mostly by the artists themselves, is surprisingly strong.The album's highlight comes when Rif Raf and Don Deedy hook up on ""Trip 2 Da Go,"" a masterfully constructed smooth twisting track.Although the album has a few weak spots, this is still a nicely done compilation which accomplishes it's purpose: to showcase P Family Records' unknown talent."
4,This is not the best from this label.,"Don't get me wrong the CD is good, but this label has some new young talent that are not really featured. Like Foe Foe and Da Fam. Look out for these artist. matter of fact Foe Foe is already out."
5,Do You Swing?,"With garage bands, you're always wondering whether a new album by a new group will have the genuine spirit that the best garage does, or if it will be a fine imitation of the greats, just somehow without that je ne sais quoi. Well, the Fleshtones will slap your je ne sais right in it's quoi, and you'll be smiling right from the first tune.Whatever it is, they've got it. They were never imitators. They mixed garage with R&B;, old soul and a bit of punk anarchy. One thing you never want from a garage band is too much reverence, and the Fleshtones love the old stuff but have no problem bending and twisting the sound for their own glorious purposes.Their latest stuff seems to be picking up momentum and getting even tighter and yet crazier. This album is terrific, more than worth the price."
1,Don't Be Fooled by the Price!!,I was excited when I got a gift certificate from my hubby and kids for Valentine's day to amazon.com. I knew just what I wanted. After much looking I settled on the Philips CD and Cassette boombox. What a mistake! I've had it only a month and today I boxed it back up and I'm sending it back. The base boost is terrible. The sound is muddy and cd's sound terrible. The cassette player started playing my cassettes backwards! These are new cassettes and work fine in my car. The reception on the AM and FM bands were lousy. I was VERY disappointed with this product. I only hope I will get a full refund. This is not a good product. It looks better than it really is. Cheaply made.
2,Does not hold the bottles it claimed it does.,"Chose this cooler because it claims to hold 80 bottles. No way it can hold that many. At 11 bottles per rack times 6 racks does not equal 80 or close to it. Being dual control, since I prefer reds to white wine, this cooler cannot be regulated to a constant same temp on top and bottom shelves. Therefore, my reds on the bottom shelves are much cooler on bottom shelves than on the top shelves. The compressor is also a little noisey.But the cooler has nice appearance."
5,jewish lolly candy molds,bought this chocolate mold and the kids love the sucker idea. i use it alot when jewish holidays come around.
3,Out of control,"The book should have a parental advisory sticker on it. It was way to explict and to drama filled. Call me square but Modesty was too hot for her own good. She did things I wouldnt do even as an adult. No child of mine will be reading it. Although it was entertainment, it was to much drama. She needed her a** kicked, real good. But the good thing is she didnt catch AIDs and she got her self together."
2,Don't let the Stiletto's fool you!!,"This book was a hard read! I think I kept reading to find out if Modesty was going to find out that her drama filled life was not the way. It was written in the end that she had learned, but her actions showed otherwise. Modesty was out there if a dude had money she had her legs open. She was a little too wild for me. I'm sorry this book did not do it for me!!"
2,"Horrible racing games, not worth the money","Powerboat racing is one of the stupidest releases from Interplay.This is probably the worst racing/multiplayer game I have.There are very few boats to choose from, not to mention only 3 tracks. The graphics are sooo bad, barely even 3-D, and the multiplayer mode is very confusing.I don't even know why Interplay came out with this. If someone you know has it, borrow it, do Not buy it.On the other hand, Whiplash isn't so bad; check my review on it."
2,bad book binding,"horrible book binding, it fell apart in one week of *careful* handling.the book content is great, though, highly impressed with Sr Gutierrez"
3,Quartets in the Fog,"Back in 1994, I was so enamoured of the Sun Quartets that I practically listened to nothing else: they are astounding masterpieces, even if they ended up being somewhat of an evolutionary dead-end in the development of the string quartet. This survey was one of my many acquisitions. The Tatrai are a fine ensemble. No-one gives a more searching exposition, say, of the slow movement of the G Minor quartet than this group. The notes are exemplary. Sadly, the sound is inversely proportional to the artistic excellence. It is murky analogue. A London 'pea-souper' fog is clearer in comparison. Hungaroton is largely moribund nowadays but we would be indebted to them if it were to remaster the entire cycle (insofar as that would make a difference).The Mosaiques Quartet deserved every one of the laurels that came their wayHaydn: String Quartets, Opp. 20 & 33; The Seven Last Words of Our Savior."
3,Weird combination of great writing and pop sleaze,"Joyce Carol Oates is a terrific writer, and some of the passages in this book are incredibly powerful. However, whenever the topic turns to sex and romance, her prose becomes embarrassingly commercial, excessive, predictable, and gushy, kind of like Danielle Steele on speed. The character of Corky Corcoran is realistic in some ways, but when she ultimately presents him as some kind of macho superstud hero, the book takes an irrevocable turn toward being a disappointment."
2,Oates makes a bad Tom Wolfe,"Oates attempts a spiralling, stream-of-conscience style that reads suspiciously like a craven imitation of Tom Wolfe. She tries to pull off the highwire stunt of writing from a man's perspective, but the voice rings false. Ideally, a novel presents a seamless front to the reader; we should have no idea how it was constructed. ""What I Lived For,"" unfortunately, reveals all of its machinery."
1,Oates has written many fine books - this isn't one of them.,"I gave up on this book after reading about two-thirds of it, and I am an Oates fan. The stream of consciousness style she attempts is dizzying, and you have to sift through a ton of minute crap to get to small nuggets of what's actually happening in the story. I guess every one can't be a winner for an author as prolific as she. This one was certainly a clinker."
2,Corky -- what an annoying character!,"Maybe I just wasn't in the mood to read about someone as self-centered and obnoxious as Corky, but after a while I just didn't care what happened to him and stopped reading. Oh well, maybe I'll try again at a later date."
4,Interesting.....,"A humorous interpolation/remake of the Pink Floyd classic. This is a must for any fan with a need for a laugh. From the beginning to the end, you'll be blown away with the memorable tunes combined with twists of comedy."
5,Brilliant parody/tribute,"This one is a must for Pink Floyd fans (those that have a sense of humor, anyways) as well as people who will forever hate ""The Dark Side of the Moon"" because of endless dorm-room playings and classic rock radio airings. The Squirrels ingeniously take each song and de- and reconstruct them, in sequence, giving you a Bizarro World version of this rock staple, with unexpected segues into jazz, disco and bluegrass. They integrate the main riff from Barrett Strong's ""Money"" into the Pink Floyd song of the same name! And the non-musical sound effects are a hoot, too! Haven't seen if it synchs up with ""The Wizard of Oz"" yet, though."
4,Enjoyable Korean Mini-Series,"An enjoyable mini-series with a happy ending. Nicely done although not in the same class as ""My Lovely Sam Soon"" The male lead grows from a rather dumb, naive yet nice person to a major Korean film star in the meantime winning the girl of his dreams. The first part of the series where the fake tv contest takes place is better than the second half."
2,subtitles,the shipping was fast and the price was right but the subtitles are really hard to see and don't always make sense.
2,Not like the original,"This was no way near the original classic ""Rebecca"" by du Maurier. It is a poorly conceived spoof on a classic."
3,"It's ugly and it ain't Calphalon, but it's cheap...","Farberware is one of the best makers of inexpensive quality cookware around. Their stainless steel Classic line is also among the most durable and attractive. But on this line, I have to say, they have created some of the ugliest pans on the market. But hey, the price is right, isn't it? If you're looking for nonstick, and don't have a big budget, you sure could do worse. But if you want top quality and design, go for the Calphalon Commercial Nonstick, the best available. After all, you are going to be cooking thousands and thousands of dollars worth of food in your pots, so the cost of the pans is almost incidental.Enjoy!"
1,Worst set ever!!,After only 2 months this set is ready for the garbage. I was shocked at how easy the cheap nonstick coating cooked off the large pot after making fudge the other night. The nonstick surface on the other 4 pans were also unusable after 2months. I can't believe I fell for all these high praises for this set. I'm sending the pots back to Faberware COD since there isn't any guarentee or warrantee.
3,"Great Quality Sets, BUT.......(LOOK BEFORE YOU ORDER!)","We got this set as a great bargain here at Amazon.com. The qulity is great! Easy to clean and durable even after one year of use. The quality itself is much more beyong my expectation!! BUT.....I just discovered that the ""10-inch deep skillet"" is actually 9.5 inches. Maybe this is the reason they are on sale, but I think they should either change the statement or give a ""real"" 10-inch deep skillet."
5,good value!!,"I just received my set today, it's great! The quality is very good. I would not hesitate to purchase another Faberware product. I also got the Faberware tea kettle, again excellent quality. For the money you can't go wrong."
2,Extraordinarily mediocre,"Non-stick is a bit overstated. Not the easiest to clean (yes, I know how to cook--ask my girlfriend.) Saw the price drop and thought I would give them a try. Takes a while to heat up. One pan already has scratches and I only use it for eggs which inexplilcably seem to be able to penetrate the non-stickability (yes, I only used plastic utensils and a sponge to clean.) Was really expecting more because the name. I let my roommate keep my Analon when I moved. I predict this Farberware set will be tossed, given away or gather dust. Guess I will be buying a new set. If you have never used anything nice or just want a starter set or need to collect rain coming in thru a leaky roof, this set will do just fine."
5,I do not believe I have ever had such a good deal...,"so I had to say something. There is nothing wrong with this set except the price. I probably would have paid more. I have had them almost a month now and all is cooking swimmingly. They heat evenly; nothing sticks to them and the clean easily. I wasn't that enthusiastic about the glass covers (because I drop everything) but they are very sturdy and the covers are a non-issue now. The set is the perfect size and amount of ware and I cook everyday.Ok, I've had these bad boys three years now and they are tremendous. Above recommenation still stands."
2,All peices smaller than average set's peices,"I just received these today, to replace a set (different brand, similar make) I got 1.5 years ago. The set I'm replacing had the same # of peices only they are the ""typical"" size you receive when you buy a set like this. When I first saw the size of all the peices in this set I was shocked. I didn't compare the sizes of each peice in each set before I ordered the Faberware and I wish I did because I think I'll be sending this set back. What am I going to use a one quart sauce pan for? Or a 7"" skillet? They only things I can think of is warming a cup of milk in the first and scrambling ONE egg in the latter.The quality seems durable, so I'd only recommend this item if you're looking for peices in a set sized this small."
3,Made it so I qualified for free shipping,I put these in my cart since it would be cheaper to spend a couple of dollars on these and get free shipping than it would have been to pay for the shipping. They are cute and I kept the biggest and the smallest for making St. Patty's cookies and my daughter uses the rest with her play dough and loves them. Good buy!
4,good album,"I bought this album after reading a review in Magnet magazine. They do sound a bit like the shoe gazer bands of the late 1980's and early 90's, but there is more to them than that. They incorporate acoustics into their music which the other bands of that particular genre didn't, ie: Lush, My Bloody Valentine, Chapterhouse, et al. The guitars seem to be layered, adding a deep, somewhat brooding sound to their music. I'm still getting used to the tracks and don't know them by heart yet, but #3,4 and 7 are very good.This is petty, but I wish the cd or webpage had the lyrics to the songs because they are somewhat difficult to understand. I might appreciate the songs a lot more if I knew with certainty what they were saying."
4,The best Star Trek computer games ever in one package!!!,This game is a good start for Trekkies looking for a good game. I didn't understand what was wrong with Star Trek:New Worlds. I think ERSB rated to high. That's the only problem that I see.The other 3 are really cool. This is a 'must get' for Star Trek fans.
4,Whoozit photo albuum,"It is a very nice product. I bought if for my 1 year old grandbaby to take to nursery with him. I put in pictures of the family so he could look at them with his teachers. My daughter says it very useful, and he is adapting to his nursery quicker."
2,baby photo album,This photo album was a disappointment - it is strictly for infants up to about 1 year of age - not appropriate for the 2 year old I had in mind. Not enough pages for photos. Textile inserts that were not advertised. Would be great for infants but not for me!
3,Settled in desperation,"There is an album out there that I've purchased before and like much better, but this sufficed. The photo dividers weren't as impressive as they described. Wish I could remember where the other album was from."
3,nice idea,"My baby girl is definitely stimulated by the photo book, but it seems that the toys that I have bought from Manhattan Toy, including the photo book, are poor in quality and not very sturdy. I would try and different photo book next time."
3,"Won't protect your pictures, but baby still loves it",Really bummed out the picture just slides in do baby can pull it out. Other ones like this have a small plastic flap that flips over the back of the picture to secure it in. My daughter loves this though!
4,Helpful for the time between lessons,"I find it very helpful to have the basic steps outlined in this book. It helps me know what steps I need to practice. For visual learners, it's just what is needed. I looked all over the web for just such footstep outlines for the dances, and this book is very clearly written and explained."
5,satisfied,Ordered the book 'Shall we Dance' to help me learn foot placement and other helps in ballroom dancing. It was just what I wanted.
3,Very good for beginners,"This is very good for green beginners. You will soon outgrow it, but it will keep you busy for awhile. It has footstep diagrams, which I found very helpful. When you are ready for something a bit more challenging, check out my review for ""Ballroom Dancing: Step-by-Step"".My wife & I just completed beginning ballroom dancing classes, and have enrolled for intermediate. It is cheaper than marriage counseling, and more productive and enjoyable. You can't fight when you're concentrating on your dance steps!"
4,Surprisingly good,"I'm not one to read sports biographies and this one had sat in a basket at a relative's condo for years. Finally, one rainy day, I picked it up. From the cover, I expected a few corny anecdotes and a slathering of platitudes. Instead, I found a man who is tremendously down to earth, who has tremendous insight and understanding of life, who doesn't take himself too seriously, and who genuinely appreciates people - all types of people. I learned a lot about life and how to live it from this book. I'm a football fan and miss him doing commentary, but never realized what a down to earth person he was/is. A good read."
3,a pretty cool/informative journal of various punkrockers.,"for anyone into the punkrock scene,here is a book that captures all the sights and smells of being on the road. not as many sado-masochistic rantings as henry rollins book ""GET IN THE VAN"",though. man,those punkrock kids sure do talk about their bodily functions. it's a beatiful thing when you're in touch with your bowels. Rachael did a great job with this book. And by the way,I have a personal story of my own on page 147 and it doesn't contain anything about gastric distentions,urination or constipation. enjoy."
4,Great for scuba,Great product. I use this for scuba trips. Works as advertise. Just a little thick going on.
3,No angelfish anywhere!,"This book is a great book if you wish to read up on a multitude of fish types, except angelfish, which are the most popular!I found it very frustrating when trying to decide on the last of seven fish to get for our aquarium, not to find the most popular in, what seemed to be, such a comprehensive book. There is also no clear indication of what follows in subsequent volumes so I don't even know if I buy those, whether I will find the missing chapter!The book also covers fish for both the diver and the aquarist and so as an aquarist I get very excited only to discover that most of the fish are not available at local pet/fish stores.Apart from these I was torn about my rating because it is a very well produced and thorough book except for those few foibles."
3,Not complete.,"Although what is contained in this book is good material, the atlas was in fact not what I was looking for. When I purchased this book I was not aware that other volumes would follow. In attempting to create an all-in-one sort of book, this covers filtration, etc. I bought this for the care of inverts and fish, yet half my stock will be in ""future volumes""!!!!, so I can find out about them in 2-3 years, If you expect this book to be your all-inclusive guide, plan on waiting for ALL the volumes."
4,Pretty good but missing some of the most popular fish,"I purchased this book as a reference for all marine fish and reef organisms only to find that the marine atlas has A LOT of invertibrates and fish but missing Clown fish. It never occurs to me that these popular fish are not included in the fish sections (although it is mentioned in the picture captions here and there, but no special fish section to describe such).As with one of the earlier reviewer commented, this was written and translated as a German book; maybe some fish types are not allowed to be sold in Germany but it is quite sad to see them selling the English version worldwide missing some of the most common species of fish that marine aquarist kept. Hopefully they will combine the entire volumne in the future for the worldwide market."
3,Good,"The product serves its purposes, however is a little wobbly. Feels like the screws are loose but it isn't when you check. It is not a bad product and my daughter likes it. I am satisfied with the product."
1,Horrible Delay,"so far, this product is over one month late. Not here for Thanksgiving. Not likely for Christmas and it shows ""shipping soon"" so I can't cancel it.Horrible company. I do not recommend it."
1,Poor manufacturing makes it impossible to assemble.,"Assembling the table requires attaching 4 legs with 2 screws each. Unfortunately, the screw holes are not properly drilled, so the screws get stuck about halfway through.When I complained, Lipper kindly sent me another table, which had the same issue.Perhaps the problem can be solved with a drill, which I don't own, but that's more assembly than I expect from premade furniture.The shelf on the first table was slightly off kilter as well, an issue I probably would live with if I could assemble the table."
2,Table is too tall.,The table is too tall for a 3-4 year old. I had to get out my saw and cut the table legs. I had a chair seat with a broken piece. I used wood glue and clamped it overnight to fix it. The chairs are not level. They rock back and forth. This purchase was not worth the price.
1,"Recevied two, both were damaged","I purchased this as a lightening deal over the summer and kept it for Christmas for my daughter. When puttin it together on Christmas Eve, multiple places of the set were damaged (although the box it came in was undamaged); the corner of the table was scrapped and the edges were missing paint. I called Amazone Customer Service, who was VERY helpful, and had a second set shipped out to receive in two days. The second set arrived as scheduled but now this table was damaged as well; pre drilled holes were missing and those that were pre drilled didn't match up with the parts. Called Amazon Customer Service again and again was VERY helpful. We will be sending both of these sets back and purchasing different set all together. I would not recommend Lipper International for any furniture."
2,Disappoined as to quality,"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. There were several rough places where a child could almost get a sliver from brushing up underneath the edge of the table, the table and chairs weren't stained very well, and there were scratches in several places. I would not recommend buying this product!"
2,Table/Chair Set,"Product quality a disappointment. Flaws in finish require better inspection before shipping, and if incurred in transit, mandate much better packaging. Some work required during assembly to correct holes too small to accept screws.Would not order this product unless you have good tools and can do some repair to finished surfaces."
5,More than I expected,"I am more than pleased with the quality and size of the table. I bought this for my grandchildren who are 3 & 5 years old. My grandson who is 5, is very tall for his age. I was worried it would be too small for him. It is perfect, and will last for years to come. I have no problem sitting on the chair myself. The wood is very heavy and solid. I read one review that said how hard it was to put together. My husband (and grandchildren) put this together in about 20 min. I have been shopping around for a long time for something that would last for a long time, and trying to find a good deal. I found it!!!! It looks like I paid alot more for it than I did."
3,"Lipper International 534C Child's Table & 2 Chairs, Cherry",Very Heavy. Putting table together use a power screw driver/drill to tighten all the way. All went well till 4th leg. Not sure if the holes weren't drilled right or the screws were just too soft. Stripped the screw head- with manual driver & it needs to be replaced. It still was sturdy w/out the 8th screw. It's nice looking. The construction (except 4th leg) seems good. The finish was spotty & should have gotten another coat. I expect that the kids will bang it up & it WILL stain if that matters to you. The color is on the lighter side. Looks more like maple.
3,Okay - does the purpose but kind of shaky,Does the job for the price. We've had it about 2 weeks and it is wobbly already and needs to be tightened. Not a huge deal but one screw was stripped from the get go. Still functional but just okay.
5,Best killing ever!,This game is so brutal. The use of the physics engine for dealing damage was an incredible innovation that I don't believe has been recently matched. It's all about beheading ogres.
5,"A realistic novel, set in 1958","Night Riding is a great book! It is set in the countryside of America, in 1958. The narrator of the story is Prin, an eleven year old girl who lives with her mother and fifteen year old sister. Her father is sick in hospital, from TB. When the Hammonds move into the house next door, Prin hears all sorts of rumours about them. That B.Z. Hammond (the father) beat up his wife, before she died, and now beats up his fifteen year old daughter, Mary Faith. When Prin gets to be friends with Mary Faith, she also finds out Mary Faith is pregnant. Determined to find out more about the Hammonds, Prin goes night riding and watches B.Z. Hammond try to molest his daughter, but what she doesn't know, is that B.Z saw her, and now Prin's in danger herself..."
4,Fun and yet educational.,this book is can be fun and yet also educatonal for youth. I am absolutly love Elizabeth II and when I saw this book you can only imagine I wanted it. but i must say after it came in th mail i was rather diapointed after it came in the mail. The characters did not look as they do in photographs and th eoly likenessess I could see were princess anne both when she is a infant and a grown woman. Young Elizabeth II as pictured on the cover of this book just dose not look like herself as she did.I was not really impressed by the clothing presented for the dolls either. The cover really seems to hamm up this book.
5,"The Canon Logic, stepping it up to new levels","Amazing album, great light rock easy to listen to and always enjoy. Recommend this to all sorts of music listeners. You won't be disappointed. Get a copy!"
5,Better than pictured,Very sturdy and durable quulity. The bar is made of commercial grade playground plastic rather than wood as pictured. The handles are large enough for hands or feet. The chain is heavy duty and coated about 2/3 up. The only drawback is the chain was not long enough for the bar & handles to reach low enough for our 4yr old (our swingset is 7ft high). But additional chain can be purchased at any hardware store and easily attached with quick links.
4,Out of the box and on the swing in minutes,Great product and a great value - trapeze was delivered on time. It came complete with all hardware needed to replace the old rusty and sticky trapeze. The hand grip (on the bar)and the rubber-coated chain is much nicer than the old trapeze and we'll have to give it some time to see how it holds up to the elements and little kids. At this point I'd buy it again.
5,"great lyrics as well, though","i would agree perfectly with the previous reviewer, but to understand the thoughtful lyrics offers an ultra-bonus! its wonderful to discover an album with a honest purpose, and to reiterate the last review, that is beautiful. break out the french manuals for an extra star.as a functional review for browsers: if you appreciate stereolab, this album is complementary in many regards."
2,"untrustworthy journalism, but a reflection of the times","The Lyman Family account is mostly fiction. In an anniversary book Rolling Stone magazine compiled a few years ago, the author relates how his desk was piled high with drugs so that he could finally start writing. What I find fascinating, however, is Mel Lyman's compassion for David Felton. It's the wise man humoring the fool. And if you read the whole article between the lines you can learn a lot. Rather than spend a lot on a beat-up old paperback, though, you could try microfilms of Rolling Stone at your library, I believe it's issues 99 and 100 or thereabouts for the original two-part report. Mel Lyman is one of the most fascinating men of the 20th Century."
3,Not Totally New,"This book should prepare one for the NEW GED, but the book itself is NOT totally new. The greatest changes are in the areas of math and writing, but even these pages are largely a repeat of Steck-Vaughn's old book aimed at preparing one for the l988 edition of the GED.Most of the publisher's hype about the book are unfounded. It, for example, is clearly not the biggest GED book available, despite that claim on the cover. And it most certainly is NOT the best. If you buy individual study guides for each subject, then you don't need this book. It is just a condensed reprint of the others."
2,GED,If your going for GED testing soon this book is not the book for you. I don't like this book but trying my best since I brought book already
4,gift book,"This item was given as a gift to a friend, who specifically requested it, and expressed great satisfaction on receiving it. Pricing, delivery and product integrity were all satisfactory. My rating it a 4 out of a possible 5 reflects only the fact that I lack first hand experience with the purchased item, and can only reflect the limited information conveyed to me by its recipient."
5,Complete GED Preparation,This is an excellect book for preparing for the GED. My son was stuggling to get through the pre-test for the GED until I bought this book for him. I would recommend it to anyone looking for help with the GED.
5,GREAT,great way to prepare well enough to test out right away! Simple to follow. Good pretests to start with. Breaks everything down perfectly!
5,Helpful,I brought this book to help me get ready for my GED . It is very helpful and has helped me prepare for it with a lot of information.
3,GED Preperation,"I recommend this book. It is very well done. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it was written in, and I thought only the first pages were going to be written in. But the seller was nice enough to reimburse me the money and let me keep the book for the inconvenience. If anyone wants a book for GED prep and for general knowledge, it's great!"
4,just what i needed,this manual is exactly what was need. i always find what i need on amazon. the manual is for my son and it is easy for him to use and understand.
5,Great for math,"I bought this book strictly for the math section and it was the best self teach math lessons I've ever studied. I completed my GED in July of 2012 and this book helped me tons with my math, which was my weak spot. This book covers everything from basic understanding of place value up until geometry. It starts at the very bottom of all math and works it way up. Plenty of practice problems to try on your own too. Covers all areas as well but I didn't use it for them so I can't really comment on how good they are. This book was also way cheaper then I would have thought it was. Worth every penny:)"
2,GED BOOK,The kids did not care for the book at all we ended up getting the online test. I needed this book because I home schooled my kids but like I said they didnt get much out of it so this was a waste
4,Okay!,This book is good if you are preparing to take your GED. I still working in the book didn't take my test yet but overall you can use this book to help get ready for testing.
3,Angela barnes,"This is a good book for only those who are serious about studying for their GED because it is very thick. The exercise are ok some are unclear, lied some of the drawings related to social studies or science questions at no clear and it'd difficult to,answer the question using information from the drawings. Overall the book is ok. It a lot of information."
5,STECK VAUGHN GED prep.5 star!!!!!!!!!!!,"The steck vaughn GED prep book is a great book because thay are the same publishers of the GED TEST. So the book is in the same format as the test,also it has all the subjects to study and vary easy to follow.I got a super bye on amazon.com about half price at $17.00"
3,Two and Half rating,The information in the book is fine but the lessons in it are not what I hoped for. The math especially. There are only two questions to solve in each area and it simply isn't enough practice when you're as rusty as I am with the UNUSED math. I'm disappointed.
4,Great love story!,This book was well written and had interesting characters. I liked the way the author blended the characters and wove them together in this love story. Excellent reading!
3,worth a listen!,I thought that this album was hilarious. If you laughed at Hooray for Boobies then you'll love this! If I had to compare it to another artist I would say that it was like Less Than Jake - the album is quite punky and makes good background music.......although I would not have paid more than about $11 for it.
3,I expected some prison testimonies I guess.,I am somewhat disappointed with this because the cover decieved me. I felt that Mr. Wurmbrand is bitter toward those who do not know of the persecution going on in other countries.
3,"Interesting, but very judgmental",Not my favorite read. I wasn't impressed with the judgments the author makes on America as a whole. I don't think the actions of some should be an indictment on us all.
5,No problems,"This was a fast, easy transaction with no difficulties. I would buy from this seller again.This is a great book that makes me realize that today's Christian needs to get their spiritual armor on and prepare to be persecuted. We're worrying about mosquito bites when the early Christians faced lions."
1,not worth it,"My three year-old received this for Christmas. The video is a half-frame off, so you see the bottom half of Cinderella dancing with her torso and head *below* her feet - terrible! When run in ""rewind"" it is better, but still the picture is slightly off. Don't bother with this toy."
2,mom of 3 princesses,"My 4 year old recieved this for Christmas and it worked for about 5 minutes. Another reviewer complained about the screen being a half a frame off, well that can easily be adjusted with the the focus wheel. My daughter's showed the movie one time and froze. The rewind feature didn't work. Even fresh batterries couldn't bring it back to life. The packaging was thrown out with all of the Christmas debris so I can't return it. Not very durable, but it was cute when it worked."
5,Kids are happy,"I've never used this personally, but my 6 yr and 3 yr old love it. They fought over it at first. They pretend it's real and record stuff around the house."
1,oh...disappointing...,I thought it would be better..Now I think that it's not even better than it's precurser...
3,Alot of action; not alot of depth,"This book is not one of the best I've read (not a book you can't put down), but it is entertaining and some parts are very good."
1,Juvenile Writing,"I have been an avid reader since I was five and a writer since I was seven. I mention this because the writing in this book goes back to my skills around the age of ten. The characters are like little cardboard cutouts with no depth at all, the motivations seem false, the ""I am a good guy"" or ""I am a bad guy"" inner monologues are ridiculous, and the author commits a serious writing no-no by telling instead of showing.I am all about a good, brainless read, but this one did not keep my attention at all. Usually I can trust reviews, but it seems that the reviews posted here are a little off this time. I feel that I need to warn intelligent readers that this feels more like young adult fiction than anything written to capture the complex minds of adults. Pass on this one."
5,Thank you Rebecca,"This book is wonderful.Rebecca's use of imagery and character description really sucked me in. I read most books 2 chapters at a times, I found myself reading this book 5 chapters at a time.She really sucked me in to her world. It was a wonderful read."
3,Not as good as C.L. Wilson's Lord of the Fading Lands....,trilogy but OK - the Wilson's first two books were just so much more superior in writing and suspense. I could have put this book down easily (truly I don't know why I kept going). The characters were a bit shallow and childish - not really developed. You never got to know Elena too much - yeah she was depressed but the author did not spend too much time on her. Marigold was just childish in her thinking. And Ezratah's misogynist comments got to be too old. The author spent too much time on his character and too little on others. The pace of the book was slow too - it could have been half its size -- but I did finish it.
4,Mellow,Heard some of this group online and decided to buy a few of their CDs. Nice mellow type tunes with mostly female vocals. Seems to be a two person group with some computer gen'd instruments - guessing. I liked it and highly recommend adding it to your collection.
1,not good...,"while i do like the idea and intention behind the 'truth about series', i have to say that enochian magick is not a subject that can be justice by such a treatment. that being said, it becomes obvious that this book is a waste of time and money. if you do not want to commit to reading one, or even several books, on the subject you will still be better served to use your pc and the internet to do some 'research' vs relying in this pitiful excuse for a 'book'... stay away from this one."
2,Not worth the money,"I read other people's reviews before buying this brief case for my wife. One said it was made of soft italian leather and has beautiful stitching. Not! It is advertised as a leather brief case. I can't say it isn't leather but I can say it doesn't feel like leather, it doesn't have any flexibility, it definitely isn't soft and the stitching looks like relatively cheap white thread that wouldn't hold up for long under the stress of being stuffed with papers. Unfortunately it seems like companies can get away with claiming any material they want if it's been swabbed with that material before it is put on the market. The whole thing may be leather but it has more of a feel of plastic covered cardboard. Obviously, wanting to return it, i didn't dissect it to prove my point."
3,This is a huge bag,"McKlein Winnetka looks well made and nice, except that it is huge. It is also very heavy. If one needs a bag that just fits a laptop, some papers, and a few small things, then there is no need for a bag of this size. Maybe it works for taller women (I'm 5.4), but I returned mine, and instead got a Jack Georges laptop tote."
3,Great bag except for the outer latch!,"I purchased this bag for my daughter who is studying to be a doctor. She used it to carry her laptop and medical instruments she uses for examinations. The bag is beautiful but the little turn latch on the outer compartment broke off. We tried to have it repaired but it could not be repaired. I bought her another model to replace this one. It is a McKlein too, hope it holds up!"
3,BEAUTIFUL,"I gave it 3 stars, because although my daughter loved itthe smell is still there weeks later.We tried airing it out, using freshner and if you leave it in your carfor a day the smell is still there."
4,Beautiful and Functional!,"This laptop bag is true to the color shown online, has plenty of pockets, and has held up well so far to everyday use. The only drawback is that it's rather large. I tried to find a slightly smaller bag for my Macbook, but everything more compact was also more expensive!"
4,Great quality for the price,"This is my second McKlein USA bag and I am pleased once again. It's a beautiful bag and I get compliments about once a week. The quality is top-notch and not only is it attractive but also very durable. I generally carry it over my shoulder and the handle is plenty long enough to be comfortable for my 5'9 frame. The front pocket has a nice organizer. My only complaint is that it could be a little bit deeper in order to accomodate more easily my medium sized water bottle. This bag is more of a streamline breifcase so if you plan on lugging a bunch of stuff around, this is not the bag for you. It's also a made of a thick leather and is definitely not the lightest bag available. For the price, an excellent bag."
4,Love it!!,Love this bag!!I have gotten complements on how it looks.Not a lot of room after my laptop is in therebut it holds everything I need. Easy to get thelaptop in and out of bag with the removablesleeve.
2,Served for one week only,"I would like to warn all potential purchasers about this product. It looks very nice and professional. It is heavy, but the quality of leather is good, should lasts for a long time. BUT the front lock fall off in one week (((((. It is still functional, but you expect more for money you got paid."
3,Not big enough,It's a beautiful looking bag but there's not much room in it. It doesn't open well when you need to put thing in or pull things out. I'm going to have to find another bag. Should have returned it.
3,A revised version is available,"It should be noted that there is a revised edition of this book (September 1999, by Jason Carl). There seem to be some fairly significant changes, so if you are looking for a manual to explain the rules of an existing LARP, find out which edition they are using before you make your purchase."
3,A useful companion for live roleplay.,"This book is a reasonable rules set for the larp folks. It's not a thrilling read, being mostly rules and mechanics, however it doesn't claim to be anything different. There are a lot of things it leaves out which I feel should be included, such as Hunters, Magi, Garou, the Faithful, and other world constructs, however these are published in other books, presumably to rake more cash out of the roleplayers. And while it's not the most clearly written of any White Wolf product, it's not cryptic. If you like vampires and live action, pick this book up."
3,Quality is lacking,"While the ring looks very nice (shiny), I had it for less than a month & already one of the CZ diamonds fell out. Some quality is lacking, but given the good price, it was probably to be expected."
1,thick posts,I tried to leave a review before but amazon wont let me. These posts are so thick you cant possibly get them into your ears.
1,"i agree -- bad writing, bad advice",more than any other Let's Go book i've used - and i've used many - this book reveals the immaturity of its writers.
2,"""Baptiste"" Power Yoga","The name of his brand of Ashtanga Yoga says it all, despite his denials - the man's a raving ego-maniac. The actual yoga is OK, but his rationalizations about ""finding your own way"" the way he did, to arrive at what he ""modestly"" says ""others may call enlightenment"" is just skin-deep, self-indulgent self-infatuation. He doesn't even acknowledge the sources of his teachings; it's as though he invented yoga de novo. My advice is to skip it and go to a book that at least pays tribute to the 1500 or more year-old yoga traditions, and to the rediscover of Ashtanga Vinyasa, Krishnamacharya, his students, Desikachar and Iyengar, and those who brought it to the West -- Van Lysbeth, Norman Allen, and David Williams. A really good one is ""Ashtanga Yoga: The Practice Manual: An Illustrated Guide to Personal Practice"" by David Swenson."
2,Good start for Asana,"Baron's use of Iyengar Yoga and Ashtanga are accessible and a good starting point for Asana practice (postural Yoga). There is little insight that can be gained by reading his stories. His philosophy is at best very basic. This should be called a beginners guide to yoga. Once you have read this you will be ready to do poses. Where you will go from there is up to you. Eventually you will want to shed the Ego and develop a yoga practice. Good luck on your journey. If this works for you great. I didn't like his classes, teacher training and I found him to be angry, cruel and self centered."
1,Could he be more annoying?,"I have been practicing yoga for quite a few years now. I can't begin to fathom, knowing what I know about the principles of yoga, how the yoga world puts up with Baron Baptiste. Mere pages into the book it's quite obvious that the man is an unapologetic narcissist - rumor has it he's a misogynist to boot.Save your money and buy a book by someone who respects yoga, and wouldn't take a ... advance to write about it (like Baptiste did).Better yet, if you want to experience power yoga without the ego, buy one of Bryan Kest's new DVDs. He's fantastic, and refreshingly unobsessed with himself."
5,A great self-teaching guide,"This book is an extremely well structured course in the fundamental poses that comprise the Vinyasa style of yoga. Whilst we use this book as a guide for beginners at my yoga club, it would suffice as a self teaching guide. Detailed descriptions of the key elements of poses, as well as risk factors to consider, act to encourage good form and can often correct mistakes of some more experienced practitioners. For around the price of one yoga class, you can't go wrong."
5,Awesome,"Clear and to the point. Every yoga student should read it, particularly if they want to start their journey into themselves."
5,An Outstanding and Informative Work,"This book is the definitive work for anyone who wants to know about extremists in this country. I notice that one reviewer described the book as ""tedious."" I cannot agree. The book was extremely well researched, well written, and fascinating from one end to the other. A must read."
2,Informative but boring.,"Although I am a student of Poliical Extremism, I found this book very tedious. I have found many other books, scholarly and otherwise, much more interesting and worthwhile."
1,Better together? Diffuser won't fit on dryer,"I clicked on this ad for the VS624 Universal diffuser.""Better TogetherBuy this item with Vidal Sasson VS784 1875W Ionic Travel Dryer by Vidal Sassoon today!Buy Together Today: $21.58""So I ordered the combination. The dryer has an oval end and the diffuser has a round end. I cannot put them together."
3,Doesn't work for our dryer either (2.5 stars)...,"Looks like a well-designed and manufactured product, and though it does fit on my wife's hair dryer, it also pops off quite easily when the dryer is turned on and blowing. We could glue it on, but that would defeat the flexibility a bit, eh?And it doesn't fit at all on our other hair dryer.So despite what looks to be a well-made 5-star product, I have to give it 2.5 stars to balance out the ""0-star"" usefulness of the thing for us.It does say if fits ""most dryers"", but a displayed list of compatible hair dryer models would be quite helpful."
1,Crazy size,i have bought diffusers in the past and they were all universal in the fit. This one didn't even fit the hair dryer i bought to go with it. It also didn't fit the many dryers i already had at home. Would not suggest buying.
5,Good Buy!,This product works great and was priced really good. Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this to others who are interested!
3,SEEDS OF GENIUS,"One can see the seeds of Siberry's genius in these tender and remarkably mature songs with their simple but touching melodies. My favourite is Bessie, an angelic song about a cow that flies away. But I do not listen to this album as often as I do to her other work ... it lacks the emotional transcendance of her later music. So I do not recommend Teenager for those who want to investigate Siberry. Rather start with When I Was A Boy, and if you really like her music, try this one."
5,las mejores canciones en dos discos,"estos dos discos son probablemente la mejor compelacion de los heroes porque contiene las canciones mas chingonas de: el mar no cesa, senderos de traicon, senda 91, espiritu del vino y avalancha que les trajo la fama y sus siguientes fieles.hasta contiene apuesta por el rock n roll y no mas lagrimas en directo de el dicso de rarezas. Las nuevas versiones de las canciones tambien son mas que perfectas. si quieren saber porque muchos los consideran la banda mas importante en espanol, compren el disco porque captura por la mayor parte la esencia de la mejor banda de rock...HEROES DEL SILENCIO."
5,LO MEJOR DEL ROCK,if your a true Rockero than this is a must have for your collection. feel the music inside. Heroes es lo mejor del rock n espanol.
5,Maravilloso album!!!!,Este es un maravilloso album ya que contiene una recopilacion de las mejores canciones. Ademas no se nesecita comprar cada disco de los Heroes ya que cn este album es mas que sufuciente.
3,I expected more from a McKinsey than average.,It is a paradoxical view of the future. It might or might not happen. The redundancy of his views went as far as stagnation. I expected more from a McKinsey. He should have focused more on the relevancy of the more (poor) than the few (corporate world).
2,Economic Determinism at its best?!,"Kenichi Ohmae's 'End of the nation state' is a short essay on how the knowledge-driven economy is rapidly rendering the nation state irrelevent. No longer the natural business unit it will become a thing of the past. Alas, if only it were so simple. Ohmae is prone to repetetiveness, and worse still, he turns a blind eye to any non-economic factors in play. His book can be regarded a typical representative of the globalization-school, along with the inevitble economic determinism. NO, man does not live for the mall and the multinational alone! On the positive side is that at least Ohmae tries to come up with an alternative for the nation state, so lacking in many other books on this subject. But here too, the idea is one-sided and too wide-ranging to convince. This book might enthuse the fans of globalization, but it is unlikely to convert the skeptical."
5,love love them,"I love my j renee bev pump shoes. so comfortable, like walking on clouds. Look sooooo good on.The cognac colour goes with everything. Everyone asks me about them. They dress up jeans so well.Heel is not too high and can dress up or go causal with these shoes."
2,too tight,"I ordered a WW but the shoe was still too tight on the instep. It's a beautiful shoe and the color was perfect for my needs. Unfortunately, it was too uncomfortable and I returned it."
2,Like the shoe but does not fit.,"Tried to return. neither Amazon or the manufacturer provided me with return instructions. I now have a pair of shoes that I like the look of but are too small for my feet. I wear a 10.5 so I ordered an 11 and the 11s are way too small. Since I can't return, I'll give them away. I am always pleased with ordering from Amazon but not this time. I'm very disappointed with this shopping experience."
2,"Comfortable, but thats all","My old Sonys broke and I needed a quick pair of phones so I saw these and went for them knowing I was taking a chance. The frequency range got me excited about them but the price tag did not. Here's what I found:Pros:Very comfortable including long term useGood highsCons:Mids and lows are horrible.Some songs with a good balance of lows mids and highs produce an unacceptable amount of static.Bent connector can get annoying with some of the devices I plug my phones into - I prefer straight connectors but that is just my personal preference.Conclusion:I listen to a large range of music from metal to pop to piano to full orchestra. For everything I listen to, these are just plain sub par."
2,For larger heads,"I got these many because I liked the earlier model UR15C. I bought these and took them bad because of dissappointment. They don't fit, and I have a pretty normal sized head. The earcups are supposed to go around your ear, and I couldn't get the earcups to get a seal around my ear because they'd keep going in different directions. When I pressed the earcups to my ears they sounded good but otherwise they sounded terrible, no bass at all. I'd only recommend for larger heads."
3,more convenient than the whole can but hard to spin the top around.,"i have this formula dispenser and the avent formula dispenser and i must say i like the avent one better.Philips Avent Formula Dispenser / Snack Cup, BPA-FreeThis one is harder to clean and the top doesn't spin as easy when you are changing from one compartment to the next. You have to put a bit of effort into it. Even my big strong husband struggles with it. and the avent one spins with ease.I run it through the dishwasher and no matter where I put it in the dishwasher it always ends up getting flipped upside down and filled with water where as the avent one doesn't for some reason.i say buy two of the avent one and don't waste your money on this one. even though it holds more volume of formula. unless you enjoy cleaning things and working your arm muscles while you make a bottle for your screaming baby."
3,Covenient but hard to open...,I ordered this product after a friend of mine referred me to it. It is ideal for bringing your formula with you as you travel throughout the day. Only issue I have is that the cover is really challenging to get open. As embarassing as it is to confess that...it makes for a frustrating morning when trying to get ready for the day.
4,Great for travel,"I always hated toting around the formula can with my other 2 children, so when I found this, I had to buy it. So far, I haven't seemed to have had the same problems as some of the other reviewers. It is a great help to have it already measured so that it cuts out some of the mess. The only thing would be if the hole was a little smaller. The larger hole makes it a little messier, but it's still a great product."
2,Shifting does occur,"Ok product for little bottle (4oz). Formula did shift from one cell to another, which defeated the purpose of the pre-measuring option. I eventually gave up on the option and bought a thermos to hold hot water and pre-measured formula into each bottle - it was a lot easier in the end."
1,Lid doesn't stay on,I ordered this item and was shipped something that seemed like a knockoff. The lid barely stayed on and ended up opening all over my purse. If I could return it just for the principle of doing so I would. They should also reimburse me for my new diaper bag. The only thing worse would have been spilled breast milk.
4,Great but hard to open!,"I bought this product because it holds 4 dividers instead of 3. I don't have a hard time twisting it to go to the other divider for the formula, but it is a bit hard to open. I do not sterilize this for, I think, it is not in the instructions to do so. I just clean it with mild soap and warm water and leave it out to air dry. I have read in other reviews that it only holds 2 scoops. No it does not. It holds upto 4 scoops of formula. The powder comes out fine especially when you tap it in the bottle, unlike what the other review said. Another review complained about the color, which I thought was kinda weird. The color looks fine for me. The dispenser is a bit large than normal, but probably because its a 4-divider dispenser.I did not give it a 5-star because it is hard to open and you are worrying you might spill the powder inside if you are trying to open it. But all in all, a good value for the money."
1,Not very good.,Each section only holds enough formula to make a 4oz. bottle. The formula also moves from one section to another.
1,Buy the Munchkin,"We received one of these and two of the Munchkin (3 compartment dispensers). Both my husband and I HATE this one so much that we actually avoid using it. When we are holding our baby and trying to shake the formula out into a bottle, it often ends up spilling onto the counter because of the flat lid. The opening on our Munchkin dispensers has a slightly funnel shaped lid that lets the formula slide out with minimal tapping. ONE STAR for the fact that it has 4 compartments instead of 3. The Sassy dispenser would have been a waste of money, had we purchased it ourselves. Get the Munchkin dispenser instead."
1,disappointed,"I ordered this book in the hopes that published patterns (as opposed to those patterns posted by random people on the internet) would be more accurate and less mistake-ridden. However, I was disappointed. Both patterns I have tried so far from this book have had multiple mistakes in them. Some of these mistakes were immediately obvious to me and fairly easy to correct while others were harder to spot and resulted in wasted stitches and wasted time. On a more positive note, this book has photographs for all the patterns and it is sometimes possible to recreate the pattern relying solely on the pictures. On the whole, I was expecting much more from Anne Orr, a highly esteemed chrochet artist with an impressive reputation. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,"Spielberg throws a curve ball with ""Munich"".","I remember some of the controversy over Steven Spielberg's newest film entitled ""Munich"" when it was quietly released to theatres. After finally getting to see it recently, I have to honestly say that ""Munich"" is an incredibly well-done but ultimately thought-provoking movie and ranks among the most `out of the blue' films of Spielberg's career and yet another home run from him and his crew.It is the 1972 Summer Olympics in the city of Munich in southeastern Germany. The games go smoothly and joyously until on September 9, a vicious band of terrorists who call themselves the Black September, take eleven Israeli athletes hostage."
5,Another excellent film from a real virtuoso director,"Spielberg deserves warm congratulations for engaging in such a difficult and misunderstood subject such as terrorism and ""Munich"" brings the mark of a genius in his prime. The film has an excellent plot and very good tricks on the way which make it a fine thriller, but also tries to give a very personal and human view of the grave problem of terrorism and how this new kind of warfare eats away the souls of friends and enemies alike. Of course he does not avoid to follow mainly the Israeli view of the subject but through an encounter by chance he presents also the arguments of the ""other side of the hill"". The final closing picture which focuses on the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center as they were in the 70s, is an indirect but stark reminder to the American people that Israel's long war against ""terrorism"" has now become their war also."
2,"Hard to follow I recommend ""Sword of Gideon""","20 Years ago ""Sword of Gideon"" was produced with a viable cast of characters and althought slow at times as is ""Munich"" I feel it gives the viewer an easier to follow format and although S of G doesn't have the blood and gore of Munich, I believe the ""Sword of Gideon"" is a far better movie and leaves its viewers emotionally a part of both the circumstances and issues surrounding the massacre at the Olympic games and the stress and resolve of the Israelies to avenge their losses. I fell asleep through Munich and cried through the Sword of Gideon."
5,Perfect,Excellent movie. Great cast and well directed. It is an excellent depiction of the events that happened during and after the 1972 Olympics.
4,The Soul Searching Of An Assasin,"In 1972, palestinian terrorists kidnapped and murdered 11 Israeli olympic athletes. Over the next few months, ""unofficial"" Israeli agents track down and blow up several of those responsible. This movie never condemns nor excuses Israel's retaliation or collateral damage. But there is an event near the end which changes the nature of the lead agent's motives. It's refreshingly free of Spielberg's usual sentimentality."
2,Too long and boring,This movie was a disappointment as a form of entertainment. Movies are supposed to be a form of entertainment. I have no idea how it occurred to Spielberg that it would be entertaining for the audience to watch the hatred and killing between two ethnic groups depicted monotonically. I can't empathize with either side. Too gross.
3,"Good, but nothing special.","When I saw this movie with my college buddies I was expecting a very intelligent real life story. I got exactly what I expected. Eric Bana was very good in this movie and Daniel Craig was his usual self as in Layer Cake and Enduring Love. Direction was brilliant and real, with very life like stabbing in the head moment and woman getting shot in the chest bit. There was a lot of talking in this movie which was needed, but I found that all of the long talking scenes where quite boring to me.Overall this movie had no emotion or heart. I didn't care about the characters and found the movie too long. It was good, but nothing special."
1,the theme is so familiar,"there are so many things to say about the movie but l hardly put my thought into the correct order.Just as an ordinary movie it is exciting but politically it is not honest.l watched several movies of the director,steven spielberg,like shindlers list,saving private ryan,and munich.l noticed that at those three movies the theme was turning around the sufferings of jewish and their honorable struggle with their enemies.it is quite disturbing.why should it be so?they killed children and innocent people of course the opposite side did the same but that doesnt make jewish right.in short the movie is just a show and it has no humanistic character except for the Juden lives itself"
2,Boring and drags slowly,Sword of Gideon came out on VHS in 1987 and it was better than Munich. Obviously the story was the same but SoG did a better job with action and keeping your interest. I was very disappointed since it's been 19 years since the same flick came out under a different title.
4,Need Blu-Ray,"Why is there no Blu-Ray of this yet? This is a very good movie and deserves it. The drama is intense (particularly with those ominous drums from the John Williams Score), and the themes concerning violence and revenge come through very well."
3,"yes, but....","One of the reviews posted here bashes the movie as tripe. Well, Spielberg has his style which you may like or not, but it doesn't degrade the substance of the story, perhaps only the form which, again, is a matter of preference and taste. The bottom line in this movie is that the eternal feud between the parties involved has no resolution in sight as long as the (meaningless) violence is a part of equation. The movie doesn't take sides, but just shows the futility of violence on both sides. That is why it has enraged both parties who criticized Spielberg heavily. In that respect, the movie hits the nail on the head, but of course should not be compared with another format, i.e. a documentary ""On Day in September"" which is a must see, and in a way complements this work of SS et al. I give it three stars for the idea, but Spielberg's commercal and somewhat routine execution is not my kind of a movie language."
2,Over produced. Bad acting. Questionable direction. Poor camera work.,"I almost gave up on watching this movie. After three tries I finally watched the whole movie. The story line and historicity are fairly accurate. However the acting is very poor. My guess is in trying to incorporate an aura of mystery and secrecy into the scenes the producer went way overboard. The viewer is often left with shadowy scenes, mumbling dialogue and disjointed melodrama. I was surprised that this was put out by Speilberg whose direction and movies I thoroughly enjoy - except this one."
5,Alpha and Omega,"Stephen Spielberg's made two really fine movies. One is ""Jaws."" This is the other one.Holds together, with none of the sugariness or sliminess of the other movies, that make the viewer come away with a sticky-feeling soul. Spielberg isn't waving at the audience from the screen in this one.The title art is elegant. ""Munich"" appearing as just another city among names that soon fade say this story could happen anywhere today.""Schindler's List"" meant ""Schindler's Deception,"" and the movie had that coy archness all the way through.""Munich"" doesn't. Good movie, on a hard subject."
4,"Good, thoughtful and deep",Well worth watching! Stieven Spielberg shows you he is a master of getting his ideas accross - and they are not what you expect them to be!
3,What A Mess!,"Not the movie, but the Middle East, nay, the whole friggin' world.Brutish Neanderthal madness run amok. Say your prayers ,kids, becauseSanta and the Easter Bunny ain't gonna wave their magic wands to deliver us from our own ignorance. The highlight of the movie was seeing Peter Green's ""Black Magic Woman"" performed in some Middle Eastern language.Was it Arabic? The guitarist nails the solo, although you don't really get a close up view of the band. The Great Greenie is listed as ""Peter Alan Green"" in the credits. An above average movie. It had it's moments of inspiration and insight... and too many unecessary scenes. What's with the bloody naked chick dying in her chair? Sheesh! I suppose that scene is meant to draw in the women haters, or maybe to show how violence leads to the most repulsive acts. Thanks for the reminder, Mr. Speilberg."
3,Above average...,But not by as great an extent as some would have you believe...As all Spielberg movies it is a great story and well shot...but in comparing it to something like Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan this comes up well short. The executions of the supposed members of Black September become repetitive in rather quick fashion and the over the top preaching by the characters about the duality of their assignment (are they creating more terrorism than they are eliminating--sound familiar?) is trite and not believable...Overall this film comes off as one made by an AMERICAN-Jew descent...I would like to have seen the same film as made by someone who is an American first and Jewish second...I would like to see the same film done by someone who is a Jew first and an American second...the product would be far more gripping and with a lot less hand wringing...
2,Could have been a lot better....,"No need to summarize the movie...you know what happens. So, with that said:I understand what message was trying to be conveyed, but the film just lacked something. Bland acting (other than Eric Bana), gratuitous nudity (girl in the bar - it's what happens to her afterwards), unnecessary scenes of violence (you don't need to show the athletes being riddled with bullets to know what happens to them), way too long. This could have been another notch in Spielberg's belt of outstanding movies, but alas, it isn't.I do however, commend him for taking on a difficult subject matter, and for that, I give the film two stars.BTW, I lived in Munich during the '72 Olympics. I was only 11, but the memory of what happened that summer had a lasting and profound effect on how I view the world, or more specifically, on how I view humanity. I would have hoped, 34 years later, my son would have a different view."
3,Wish it Focused More on the Event.,"This was a good movie. I was a little disappointed in that the movie really didn't elaborate about the actual Munich event itself though. I was interested in the athletes, the terrorists involved, the authorities, and mainly what really happened that particular day at those ill-fated Olympics. Instead, the picture focused on the revenge of the athletes. Still, it was a good movie. Good to see historical elements and people, like Golda Meier."
4,So much blood and violence. That's basically what this title is about. 3.65 stars.,"All I remember is that 11 innocent guys who are half naked get shot for no reason at all. They're totally innocent and didn't even deserve to die based on what we knew about them which was next to nothing.I remember killing people with guns and people blowing up by bomb implants by phone. The caller calls the receiver picks up and BAM.Then I remember the main character having a family and being with them and such but that's about it.I also recall it being a ""war thing"" as far as the killings went. The killers had next to no remorse and they cared not of their worried-sick families. I also recall families watching the news about the hostages being safe and then being slaughtered. The families were so distraught and full of sorrow and pouring tears. :^(That's all I can recover from my memory banks.My personal moral: War sucks, Guys.Cover Art: C-Story: C-Dialogue: C-Characters: CLength: D+Overall: C3.65 stars."
2,"A DEPRESSING, RAMBLING FILM","With such an excellent story line, why was this viewer unable to connect with the characters and the events? I was a young man when the terror at Munich occurred - I remember with clarity and outrage. Yet, there is no real horror transmitted to the audience - only the constant confusion of watching a depressing and rambling film.I guess the people of the world must hide under their blankets and hope nothing bad happens again. Why ever take action against those who want destroy the free world? Gosh, you could make a mistake!In war, there is never a fair and balanced response - only more death and destruction. The hope is that you hurt the other side more than their capacity to hurt your side. Then, hopefully, they decide to stop and the world gets another brief respite until the next war.Avoid this film. I wish I had not seen it."
1,One of the worst.........,"This is without a doubt one of the worst films I've had to sit through in recent years. Despite the great hype surrounding the movie (largely generated by clever and misleading advertising), it fails on all fronts. The story unfolds in a slow and predictable fashion. Long periods of boredom are punctuated by scenes of gruesome, graphic violence that are much better suited for a horror film. The movie revels in this brutality to such an extent that the real message is lost. In as much, it becomes what it pretends to condemn - senseless violence. There is most definitely a deep and compelling meaning in this sad real-life story, but, as usual, Speilberg fails to find it."
2,"violence, murders, deaths and lots of hatred","I cannot believe Steven Spielberg directed this movie. This time he blew it completely. The worst Spielberg's production yet; confusing, pointless, most of the time boring, except for those scenes where bombs go off or people are murdered. The plot is totally mixed-up and extremely violent. It's a spy vrs. spy kind-of-sickening-intrigue. Did it really happen? Maybe the movie is historically accurate, may be it isn't. Be that as it may, it is still not worth watching."
4,"Great film, but emotionally draining","I won't go into the plot since other reviews already describe it accurately, but this movie is emotionally draining in the same tone as Saving Private Ryan. Eric Bana's best work. Despite it not winning any of the Oscars it was nominated for, it was definitely a worthy contender for Best Picture.This film gives a very insightful look into the Palestinian/Israeli conflict from the level of the people involved, without the news angle.Not to be missed."
2,Not what I expected,"When I rented this movie, I thought that it would be about the murders of the Israeli Olympic athletes, an event which I remember with great sadness. This event does occur in the DVD, but it is right at the beginning and the rest of the movie concerns the attempt on the part of Israel to avenge the murders and to kill those responsible. The narrative is often confusing, and the movie is full of bloody scenes of murder and mayhem, none of which was very appealing to me. The point of the movie seems to be that revenge never really works and it only becomes dehumanizing to those who engage in it. I wish I had not sat through almost three hours of this movie in order to come to that conclusion."
2,AWFUL,"What a terrible film. Clearly, all the five star reviews here are written by people who have not seen ""Sword of Gideon"", which effectively telsl the same story. I was shocked by Spielberg's lack of originality. Many of the scenes have simply been re-made, based on those in Sword of Gideon. And the attention to detail was totally dissapointing, particularly considering Spielberg is renowned for that. For example, Swiss Bank attendants, and Golda Meier, with an American accent? Not to mention most of the rest of the cast. But it is not worth wasting words on. Check out ""Sword of Giedeon"" and you will re-evaluate your high opinion of ""Munich""."
2,Munich,This movie was a disappointment to me.I was at the summer olympics in 1972 the day that the Palestinian terrorists killed the Jewish athletes. Maybe this clouds my judgement.
1,its not the truth,"this movie, isn't the truth, mister spielberg, havent spoken to the people (jews..) this movie is a wrong history"
1,Terrible disappointment,"How can this film--about an important and complex subject--be so bad--and especially so--since the great Steven Speilberg directed it. It is shallow in character develoment--very important to understand ther psychology of BOTH sides. And dully photographed. Not one really good shot. I waited to see this on video, thinking it would be really good. I just can't believe it. Worse than Da Vinci Code."
3,Spielbergs Big Dissapointment.,"This could have been much better done. The love scenes could have been left out as they served no purpose except to take up time. The movie reminded me of one of the old Three stooges, or gangster movies with a bunch of amatures running around in trench coats instead of one of the best trained and secret intellegence organizations in the world. As I had seen The'Sword Of Gideon' some years back and was very pleased, I thought this would be a good one. I was very disappointed so went out and reordered THE SWORD OF GIDION for my collection and gave Munich to one of my kids to watch so they will not waste money on it. Sad, Spielberg, you should have done better. Worth a one time look if your into spy movies. Edwards 832"
3,Deep and Disturbing,"This movie actually more deeply touched my sensitivity nerve than the original movie, ""Sword of Gideon"", however, I don't think it was as good of a movie. This is a stand alone telling of events that followed the massacre of the Isreali athletes during the Munich Games. Yet, there was no depth to the story of the aftermath of this action that Isreal took to avenge the murders. There was no background established or created about those that were killed in retaliation for planning the attack, nor those that actually carried out the attack. I gained no depth of character about the operatives (other than Eric Bana's character) nor do the film makers attempt to have you learn about them.This story, though thought provoking, could have, no should have, been better, deeper, and educated the viewers more about this historical event."
4,"I liked it, but","Technically, the movie is superb with impeccable production quality and impressive direction. Politically, the movie was partial to the Israeli point of view, which is fine since it's told from the Israeli perspective. What bothered me about it, though, was the whole shpiel about negotiating with one's own morals and values to inflict pain and suffering upon others. The movie seems to show that only the Israelis go through this tough moral questioning while the Palestinians don't. I found that to be blatantly rediculous, wrong and irresponsible.The movie successfully shows the futility of conflict and the pain it continiously inflict on people's psyche and mental health. I especially liked how the Twin Towers were shown in the background toward the end as the Mosad operatives were negotiating carrying out another ""elimination"" operation against Palestinian leaders. The symbolism of it all was striking!All in all, it's a good movie. Rent it when it comes out."
3,it wasnt really good...,i actually fall asleep on the last 20 minutes... :Sbut well... it has good performances... good special effects... it's kinda scary!! i'd say creepier than scarier!! but well...let me tell you that i would watch it again...
2,Why?,"I can't believe this is Steven Spielberg. The dialogue was so cheesy at times it made some friends and I laugh out loud.And it felt like one long commercial with all the snazzy camera moves. Then the female nudity felt completely over the top and I'm not even a prude. To me it felt disrespectful in many ways and didn't help shed any light on this complicated part of history, as I imagined it had hoped to. He should have stuck to the sensibility of Shindler's List. Instead he gave us a wham bam thank you maam shoot out that barely gets into the minds of the characters."
4,In response to Neil,"He said it is unbelievable for Daniel Craig to play a South African since he is blond haired, blue eyed. That is not unbelievable. South Africa is primarily white people. Charlize Theron is from there."
2,Bana Makes a Strong Argument......,"......For Dullest Actor on the Planet. He leads a cast of no-name nobodies in this immensely unbelievable movie. If you can watch past the ridiculous shootout at an hour and 16 minutes, give yourself a pat on the back. With so many liberties taken with history, it's ashame this travesty was even made. Dialogue rarely rings true, and characters never seem to develop any sort of rapport or even a hint of a personality. A tragedy that should've translated into a riveting movie just bored me to tears, and my eyes rolled back into my skull so many times I am permanently cross-eyed. Good shots of cities around the globe, and for capturing the look and feel of the early 70's, cudos. Otherwise, a shameful mess."
5,Few movies are this good.,"I work at one of the largests theater chains in the US, and this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The history, acting and story keep the viewer so interested in the movie that you won't want to miss a second of it. If only most movies were this good."
4,Fairly realistic,"Gives you an idea why the Israelites are failing now.Shows you the human side of the Is.First 3/5th is quite engaging, kind of loses steam towards the end. But, definitely viewable."
2,"Tough, sad subject matter","Lotta graphic violence. Lotta graphic sex. Tough, sad subject matter. I thought Mr. Spielberg did a good job showing these guys had a conscience, Eric Bana can act and does accents very well, but I just didn't enjoy the movie."
2,Not That Good,"I was real interested in seeing this movie. But its just an average movie disguised as a masterpiece. Theres one scene in the movie thats particularly terrible towards the end when Eric Bana is having sex with his wife and they show flashbacks of the terrorists, then back to Bana humping in agony complete with slow mo sweat flying off him...that scene was so bad it was funny in the unintentional sort of way and just about ruined the movie for me."
4,Land Dispute,"When Tony Kushner sticks to actual events, he's got a fast, thrilling script for Spielberg to work. The trouble is, a fine action movie is saddled with philosophical meanderings. The obviously contrived debate between the Mossad assassin and the PLO guy, the same old hackneyed arguments about what is essentially a land dispute, well, come on, why didn't the PLO guy realize Eric Bana really was a Jew? All the PLO fighters tell you how much they love their Palestine and Allah is their leader. Of course, the barbarity that meets their aims, all praised in heaven. Jews prefer a settled life on Earth be as it may, but there's little peace in the Middle East.I must tell you, The Soprano's or Godfather movies were suggested by the Munich revenge assassinations. The Mossad is so careful not to knock off civilians, too careful perhaps as their foes could care less. Good versus evil, makes for a better story, but not if you're political liberal."
5,Know what you're seeing so you won't be disappointed,I really enjoyed the film. Just know it is not the story of the athletes who died rather about the men hired to do them justice.
4,Typical Spielberg film,"Spielberg's films are so finished that it is hard to identify any work that has gone into them. Nevertheless, he consistently turns in strong films with good pacing that hold your attention. Munich is one of these films. With a great supporting cast including the evil villain from the old James Bond Moonraker and a memorable perfect set of breasts, the film has a lot going for it. An excellent job of re-creating the look and feel of the 1970s. Violent and will disappoint supporters on both sides of the Israeli-Arab conflict."
5,Before there was Bourne.,"Very tragic movie. The acting, story line and special effects were great. I bought this some time ago and have watched it several times."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A movie that captures perhaps better than any other the weariness of being an assassin far from home, Munich sometimes feels too long (especially during the scenes in America) and ends inconclusively, but supplies so much good material that I can recommend it without reluctance."
4,Really enjoyed it!,"My only regret on this film is that it is very slow going. I enjoyed the thought of the film, and the original live events that underlie the film are incredibly interesting.However, the film itself runs very slow, and is hard to follow. I love the premise behind the film, and Spielberg writes a wonderful script, but it is very hard to give a film like this five stars. That being said, it is definitely worth the money!Enjoy!"
3,Munich,"Good movie, not as action packed as I have seen but I recommend it to anybody. It wouldnt be a waste of your time if you watched it."
3,Too long and tiring,"Very little of Munich takes place in Munich. What you'll find are a series of tense situations throughout Europe where the Israeli protagonists plant bombs to kill associates of the terrorists responsible for the Munich killings. I watched, engrossed, during their first mission, but after that things started to get old. The violent, stressful, predictable scenes started to tire me out after the third mission to kill yet another terrorist associate. Munich is a good film, but it's too long. I would have been far more satisfied if the movie was an hour shorter."
3,Disturbing ...,"Any movie on this highly volatile and flammable topic by default invites curiosity and audience. The movie however turns out be a spaghetti mix that makes a vain attempt to show both the Palestinian and Israeli perspectives.The protagonist in the form of Avner starts of as a quiet team leader, turns into an obsessive head-hunter, defies initial marching orders and after a near-complete mission suffers from pangs of repentance. The end is too hackneyed for a sensitive, volatile and serious topic.In my opinion, this movie should have been directed from a reporter's perspective who does not take sides, but very simply reports on the events from a neutral perspective. Judgmental dialogs and rhetoric should be clearly avoided."
4,"it,s fun to see spielberg at his best(again)","a great dramatic thriller film .filled with eye popping period details, drama , charecters and a first rate cast and crew. there is a real peace massage for all communities in this one so it will move you and that is for sure . bana did a very good work but craig steals the show.john williams' score tunes right for the movie.brilliant use for flashbacks to give such a strength for the story .you will experiance the death of the athlets as you are being killed. you will feel a spielbergian atmosphere in this modern masterpiece.a must see for fans of the stars and the director.rush has a great role here though."
2,star systems?,"The film had good and bad points, you can't quantify qualities in a star rating. As a movie it was gripping, but it was certainly gratitious in a way that was sometimes hard to respect. It also brought out the pitifulness of the story."
5,Great Introduction to Christian Rap,"Let's get this straight- DJ Maj isn't necessarily a artist- he has other rappers perfom on his songs, while he mixes! Therefore the DJ part! Anyway, I am NOT a hip-hop type of guy (as far as I dress or talk) but I love the music,and I like this one so much that I listen to it all the time. If you every wanted to hear some of the Christian Hip-Hop/Rap artists that are in the forefront, this is like the WoW of the genre! Can't wait till the next one!"
1,this game is really bad,"I didn't like anything about this game, and I got it for cheap.Well okay the graphics were nice, but even for a 4x game it was pretty lacking. Mostly the issue I had was that you'd constantly be swarmed with enemies very fast and easily, with almost nothing you can do to prevent this. Maybe it was a bug? Not sure, but it was extremely frustrating since I don't usually have this issue with 4x games."
3,off world resource base,ok game with limited margins for victory. hard to navigate in 3d mode 2d works better for me
1,not worth it,"difficult controls, bad camera movement, and mediocre graphics are just some of the things that plagued this game. among other things were horrible AI, lack of originality, and its very...very... unintuitive. I probably wont play it again."
1,Bad game,"I ran this game under Windows XP. It crashed quite often. The game controls are poor. The game moves very slowly. Screen perspective is unrealistic -- far away objects are too large, compared to near objects. Battle action is not visually appealing. I would not recommend this game for anyone who has played Homeworld."
5,ONE OF MY TOP 10 GAMES,"I WAS LOOING FOR A PRACTICAL STRATEGY GAME AT A LOCAL BESTBUY WHEN I CAME ACROSS A REALLY COOL LOOKING GAME. I TOOK A LONG LOOK AT IT AND AFTER A WHILE I STARTED TO THINK THIS WOULD END UP BEING AN INCREDIBLE GAME. IT DID LOOK COMPLICATED, NOT THAT IT ISNT. WARNING: THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ADORE INSTANT GRADIFICATION. ANY WAY T I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT A SHOT. AND I WAS SOOO HAPPY WITH MY CHOICE I THOUGHT I SHOULD TELL ALL OF MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS GREAT UNKNOWN GAME.... SO THATS WHERE I CAME TO WRTING MY REVIEW. FOR SPACE BATTLETIME LVERS ITS A ""MUST HAVE"" ALSO ITS VERY COMPLICATED TOO. GOTA REMEMBER ALOT OF STUFF. ON THE GAME, THERE ARE TWO SPECIES YOU CAN PICK FROM: MALUS:ALYSSIANS.: THEY ARE BOTH VERY DIFFERANT BUT THE BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE THEM IS THAT MALUS ARE GREAT IN FORCE AND ALYSSIANS ARE GREAT AT MOVEMENT AND ACURACY. OVER ALL A ""MUST HAVE""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Good, but really not the best in the SVJH series","I can't exactly remember how this book went anymore because I read it months ago. I read it pretty fast, so it was interesting enough to make me keep reading it. I think this is a pretty important book in the SVJH series because stuff happens in here: about Sal kissing Liz, how Anna's brother died, etc., etc. so SVJH fans have to read it so they can get all the good details on these happenings."
4,Book4,"In this book, the twins' parents are out of town, so they decide to throw a slumber party...that turns into a party...that turns into the party of the semester! You get to read about the party from each charecter's point of view, which I find to be very interesting. And this book includes almost all the charecters from previous books. I would only say that many issues in this book are slightly more mature, and I would not recommend this book to children with very protective parents."
1,WOW this is verrry bad!,"I was introduced to the Free Designs music via their1967 debut album ""Kites Are Fun"" in the mid-nineties andthey are one of my favorite pop groups. However, theremix moniker is somewhat dubious. All these new fashionedmixes are just fragments of vocal and musical partscut and pasted to beats and electronic noise. I like re-mixes that take the actual original song and then addnew keyboard or drum on top of them to give them more of acontemporary finish. Nothing here is danceable and withthe exception of maybe one or two, they give me a headache.Very sad, because this compilation is more widely available then the groups actual ""original"" work."" I call it Trance lo-fi at best."
4,"Great practical part, bad theritical part",This book is a great protocol book for blast.But the theory part is not well organized. You may want to seek other book if you are interested in this part.
3,useful for comparative sequence alignment tasks,"BLAST is a well-known tool for bioinformatics (biological sciences+computer sciences). In this book contains a concepts of central dogma of molecular biology, sequence aligment, sequece similarity, practical BLAST programs (divide into 5 programs), and how to install and use BLAST tool. Moreover, it also offers enough tips to improve my BLAST searches usage. I think this book's content is well-writing and well-organizing for comparative sequeces alignment tasks. I use this book to begin in bioinformatics and it can help me to learn about this. But this book does not contain all of things that I want to known on bioinformatics or computational biology."
4,Something for the timid.,"This ""Quickie"" album is only 4 songs. Perfect for the first time listener. Popular songs (Magic Carpet Ride, Go-Go Dancer & I Wanna Be Like You) plus a Karaoke version of Magic Carpet Ride. I Wanna Be Like You has a rap provided by a guest artist. This can be had for a few dollars. Go for it."
5,great inspirational music,"One of my family's favorite inspirational CDs. All the songs are good, and some are really great--the title track, ""I Heard Him Come"" tells the story of Jesus's visit to a leper from the leper's perspective. Our other favorite is ""Oh Lord My Redeemer,"" a first person account of someone who walked with the Savior. This CD is guaranteed to touch your heart and bring you to tears. It really makes the Savior's life and teachings personal."
3,Could be better,As a newbie I found the book explanatory (theory wise) but my frustration stem from the fact that the codes are full of errors and thus made the whole practical part very frustrating. If only the authors could please re-read the book and make necessary corrections.
2,A bunch of code... little explanation,"This book has a bunch of code and little explanation. I don't understand how this can actually be published. The authors didn't take the time to even explain half of it, just dumped code and left us wondering."
3,Errors,"Well I tried the source code from the chapter 25 of the book , on the e-coomerce store front and shopping cart, and it didntwork :(just simply does not show anu of the categories it should fetch fromthe database."
3,Better know PHP,"I got this book because I wanted to learn PHP and MySQL. Although the book does an OK job helping you set up your AMP, you will need to visit the MySQL, PHP and Apache sites to complete your setup. The PHP info given is really quick, I assume the author thinks because he mentions something that I am suppose to completely understand. This book is not for beginners at all. It seemed to have some good info and nice code to help you build a site as long as you did not plan on altering the code to much, because you better know what you are doing. I'm sure this book would be good for someone who has some programming experience not just HTML. You should look else where if you have no actual programming experience."
3,weak,I would not recommend this book. It is certainly NOT for a beginning programmer. It assumes C programming knowledge which surprised me while reading. I found the book useful but if you are a beginner at programming find another book. Most of the examples also failed to function correctly but their content could get you going on the right steps.
1,"NO ERRATA, NO SUPPORT SITE, NO RESPONSE","The biggest reason that I would suggest that you NOT buy this book is that there is no errata, no support and no response from any of the authors or publishers when you try to contact them about a question. I don't know about you but I find it frustrating when I have a question about a book that I am working through and there is absolutely no where to go. Every other programming manual I have used has had an errata page and most will either have a forum or someone will respond to your emails if you send in a question. This book has none of those. I have not tried the other books that other people have recommended in addition to or instead of this book, but I suggest that you check those out first before you buy this book."
5,Great book for various skill levels,"This book is exactly what I was looking for. It's a great reference, and has good tutorials. It also very up to date, and deals with the new version of PHP defaulting to Register_Globals = Off. With this off, it can 'break' code, and this book explained work-arounds well. I reccomend! It also describes some security issues as well, making it a very well rounded reference."
4,2nd Edition rocks!,"This book is so cool! As a beginner in PHP I leaned a lot in this book. The price is reasonable. I wish all books are like this ""by example type"", like the PHP book by Julie Melonie that book also rocks!."
3,Not for Beginners,"I am new to PHP/MySQL. I spent a lot of time on the internet(php,mysql,apache sites)learning first how to install AMP(apache, mysql, PHP). The book does an OK job but it really does not cover troubleshooting very well. Once I got my enviornment up and running, the book was OK. Again, not for beginners. I am going to be taking a class later to help explain things a little better. I was able to get out what I needed, but I would not buy this book if I was looking to learn from scratch."
2,not that impressed,"This an acceptable book, it does assume previous programming experience and more specifically C programming experience. The examples are rather pathetic and they don't spend really anytime explaining the examples, they just suddenly appear out of no where. I wouldn't know what book to recommend but I wouldn't recommend this book for most people. I think where the examples went wrong is they went off into some huge programming example instead of using a short example to demonstrate the current topic. Large sourcecode programming projects I think are better left for the back of the book or for the authors websites."
4,Fragrant bubble bath,"The girls love this stuff so got it for my grandaughter. She was very pleased. An inexpensive gift, but liked."
3,Disappointing,"I had used Bath and Body Works' ""Very Cherry' shower gel at a friend's home last fall and was hoping to buy some of my own. The new ""supercharge Cherry Blossom "" gel is no where near as fragrant and does not have the lingering quality that the old product had. If you want something similar to the ""Very Cherry"" I suggest searching another product line."
5,Battle Chess COLLECTION is better,"Battle Chess is a great game, but don't buy this version. Buy the *Collection* instead. It has 4 games in one: Battle Chess(DOS), Chinese Chess(DOS), Battle Chess Enhanced(WindowsVGA), and Battle Chess 4000(WindowsS-VGA). The last two games, graphically, are outstanding and will work flawlessly with Windows 95/98."
1,Do not buy this CD-ROM,"I don't know what you are expecting. I don't know what you hope Battle Chess will be. I don't know how low your expectations are. But whatever your answers to those questions are, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. It is awful. I had one years ago that I played on my old MacIntosh, and my kids would delight in watching the pawns joust with one another and the queen zapping other players. But, unbelieveably, the graphics have gotten worse. It is too fast, all the action occurs without any drama. The color almost spoils it. I was so disappointed, and my children, who were looking forward to playing chess with this program, were immediately disinterested.This CD is worse than it was 8 years ago."
4,Thanks Starlady!,"""The new version however is violent and sleezy. The pieces graphically beat each other up and the queen struts like a hooker across the board. At one point when the red king challenged the blue queen, they grabbed each other in a passionate kiss, and she pulled a knife on him. He promptly swore and killed her.""You sold me!!! Oh Ya!! I love the violence, the sleeze, just the ticket to jazz up a boaring game of chess!Yup, I've had Battle Chess since the old Win3.1 daze, but I really wish they would update it to today's standards. Improve the graphics, and like one of the others stated 'add some drama to the battles', perhaps even add an adult 'R' level (lets put some real sleeze into that slut Queen!!)"
3,dos games under win2k/me/xp,"You can probably use this game under WinME, etc. I've noticed that, by default, the Soundblaster emulation is not installed for some cards. I had to do this manually for my motherboard's sound, for example."
5,"Yippeee, for want of anything intelligent to say","A mate of mine (Kiwi for friend) told me that this was like the Jayhawks and that I should check it out. My mind immediately went to Tomorrow the green grass/Hollywood era, but its more like Smile and in fact I would say closer to Golden Smog and Sweeney himself has a touch of the Jeff Tweedy about his delivery. Anyway enough of the comparisons. Its one of those albums that grabs you with the friendliness of the musicianship and country rock immediacy. Not to mention some intelligent lyrics and shifts. I know this is going to be a great favourite of mine for some time to come. So if you enjoy music by any of the afore mentioned and are looking for another band to follow maniacally, then try these guys. I don't know a lot about them and notice that they haven't been active under this moniker since 2004, having put out an album a year since 2000?What does this mean?Buy it and tell your friends. Also has one of the most fantastic packages I've seen."
2,Seam Ripped Already,I just bought this as a Christmas gift for my 4 month old. It's been one week exactly.... the seam ripped tonight and water was all over the floor. Great idea but cheap product. Bought it from a specialty store and cannot take it back. So annoyed!
3,Disappointed,"I got this as a gift for my 4 month old son. I was excited by the way it looked online, but when I received it, it is much smaller than I had expected. It by no means is the size of what you would consider to be a ""mat"". I hope my son will enjoy it anyway."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I got this mat for my 3 month old, I was very disappointed with it. It is a very hard plastic,..and has sharp edges. It isn't plyable enough for a baby to pat and play with.. I was swooshing the water around trying to soften it up some and it split at it's cheap and sharp seems..Water went everywhere.. Thank god my infant wasn't playing near or on this product when this happened. I won't be buying anything from WHOOZIT again."
4,Deeply insightful and inspiring,"Beumer's overview of Nouwen's life, work, theology and spirituality is a remarkable gift coming so soon after Nouwen's untimely death. One is drawn deeper into reflection, not only on Nouwen's thoughts about ""home,"" ""community,"" ""ministry,"" ""service,"" etc., but, unavoidably, into one's own heart and soul. The author does not present Nouwen as a ""canned"" saint, but truly as a ""restless seeker,"" a real person with positive and negative traits -- someone who, throughout his life, tried with all his might to find a place, both within and without, that he could call ""home."" I would highly recommend this book to those who have studied Nouwen's works as an excellent summary of his spirituality and theology. I would also recommend it to those, like myself, who desire a first or second taste of this modern-day mystic."
3,This book will help the beginner from the first day of sales,"The very short and easy-to-read book had numerous suggestions for making your yard sale stand out from the crowd. It addresses advertising, types of items to sell and how to market and display them, pricing, sales day, and provides a countdown of things to do before the sale to reduce your stress load.I would have marked it higher, except it dealt with topics irrelevant to yard sales in this area, like how to market antiques(hah!) and multi-day sales. I would have liked more specifics on how to price different types of items."
5,A Treasure,"Here are some useful living tips, advice and observations from that quintessential American literary figure Mark Twain, real name Samuel L. Clemens. This compilation contains a delightful mix of humorous writings on the mundane and sometimes very unusual occurrences that reflected his many gifts as a writer/humorist. Many of these snippets are from some of his more famous works, while others are from personal sketches and writings not as well known. The tarantulas escape, a borrowed overcoat, a lecture to a youth group, the use of foul language, a note to a burglar, and so many other little anecdotes, observations, and etc will elicit periods of laughter from the reader, as it did for me. A wonderful little treasure."
5,Somewhere Between Emily Post and Amy Sedaris,"Mark Twain weighs in on everything, even the social graces. His critique of ""American versus European Food"" makes Martha Stewart sound like Alice Kramden. (It will also make your mouth water.) Not sure what to do in case of emergency? Twain covers everything from apparitions to earthquakes. These helpful hints will improve your parenting skills, raise your I.Q. score, and prepare you for a career in foreign diplomacy."
2,Poorly typeset,"The book is hard to read, as the typeface size is too small. It looks to me as if the book was set for a larger format, and then, perhaps for economic reasons, optically reduced to 6x8"". If you look at the footers, which include the title, chapter and page, you'll see how odd they are; the page number in particular is very hard to decipher. Some of the pages are printed unevenly too, making the characters too small and too light in places. And the pictures and graphics, while nice, in quite a few cases are cropped strangely--again suggesting a larger size was originally used and abandoned. All in all, it's a shame, because the material, as much as I could read, anyhow, appears to be a nice compilation."
3,mark twain's helpful hints,"the book, wsan't what I expected to long, love twain, but this went into too much detail, where twain's charm is his brevety"
5,Easy--Mark Twain is the best.,"The man is a genius. Charming, witty, even biting at times, and to be understood with an undercurrent of the love of mankind and his foibles and failings, as well as the pathos of having a lived a life of struggle and pain. He was a real person, and what he had to say is still real today. Read him with your heart."
1,Worked for two months,This was a factory reconditioned unit. It has developed a problem--echos occur when listening to HD stations
2,Great sound quality...with the right external antenna,"Just as most reviews state, the Receptor's am/fm tuner is extremely weak for a radio of this ""quality."" I took some advice and tried a few ""T"" type antennas and found one that actually locks in (and holds 99% of the time) all local HD fm stations. It is a simple non-powered VHF/UHF Indoor TV antenna from Radio Shack (Product# 15-1874). Note: the dual-antenna poles must be folded out into the ""T"" position, which makes it very visible unless you can hide it behind a piece for furniture (i.e. its ugly). It has a 3' coax cable and connector that is the right guage/thickness to screw onto the back of the Receptor very tightly. I have not found the included AM antenna to work at all, even with the strongest of AM stations. But for FM & HD stations, the Receptor seems to work great with the right antenna."
3,Don't expect wondrous new sound!,"Well, it's cool to be able to hear some of the digital stations not available on an analog radio. But the FM sound quality of this radio is no better--and sometimes not as good--as the little analog Bose radio, which is about the same price and same size. And the Boston Acoustics remote doesn't work if it's held a little above and about 15 feet away from the radio. A minor point, but the Bose remote works great at that angle and distance."
1,Boston Acoustics HD Clock Radio,"Very ""muddy"" overdriven bass which you cannot trim out--even with the control. The manufacturer admitted to the problem in an e-mail to me. For the price, there should be treble AND bass controls, or an equalizer. FM reception was fair at best, but it was the huge bass component to the sound that prompted me to send it back. Cannot recommend."
4,Very good reception and easy to operate.,"I am reasonably impressed with the reception abilities of this radio, especially after reading some of the reviews here. I live in the SW burbs of Omaha and can get 13 HD stations (one of them is even AM).The radio is very easy to operate, in fact I have yet to unseal the manual. Comes with a standard FM dipole antenna and an AM loop antenna, which I am using for my antennas.I haven't used it as a clock radio very long yet, so I can't comment on the long term accuracy of the clock section, but it seems to be good so far.The only two features I would would have liked to find and did not on this radio are an equalizer for the radio sound and a scan / auto-station load into preset feature. Other than those two (minor IMHO) additions, I think the radio performs well and is priced accordingly."
2,Great Sound and Clock But Unreliable,"Bought a Receptor at Radio Shack. Hooked it up and it sounded great. The radio came on in the morning - perfect. Shut it off for the day. Came home and the unit would not turn on again. Fussed with it for 30 minutes - nothing. Display was on and showed signal, volume, all the signs of radio life. But nothing came out of the speakers. I will return today for a replacement. But the three strikes policy will apply."
1,Defective Radio,"I purchased a refurbished Boston Acoustics Receptor HD Radio from Beach Audio. It was defective when I received it. I notified Beach Audio, got a Return Authorization Number from them, sent it back and received a refund immediately. A reputable seller, in my opinion."
1,disappointing purchase,"I received the radio promptly but could not plug it in, because the power cord was missing. I rang up Amazon in hopes perhaps Amazon had the missing part, but no, I had to pack everything up and ship it back (try getting parking near the Alexandria UPS store. Just try). Could it be replaced, I asked. No, Amazon told me, Amazon isn't carrying this model any more. Talk about a lot of time and trouble wasted!"
2,Secret Menu Discovery,"Looks great on paper and all, but sounds really bad. Way too much bass which realy muddies up the low end frquencies, regardless of location. I too have the original BA Receptor and I rate it much better overall in both reception, audio quality, and value. But since I am early adaptor, I just had to try the new one. It sounded so bad out of the box I knew something was wrong so I started adjusting a few things. By accident, I was able to access a hidden menu by continually pressing the clock button (under the controls lid) for 20 seconds or so. There are many more ways to adjust EQ, etc., but without a manual there are some adjustments I am hesitant to make. I did however attenuate the bass to almost nothing, but the unit resets itself after I leave the menu and goes back to sounding like do-do. Any thoughts?"
1,Not up to expectations,"I recently purchased the Receptor HD. Out of the box it was a fairly complex set-up. The antennas are totally inadequate. I am 10 miles across water from Seattle and neither antenna can pick up more than half the HD stations there. I have an Accurian from Radio Shack and it picks all the stations up with no difficulty using the same antenna(s) in the same place. And it cost 1/2 as much. The Receptor sound is ""boomy"". If you walk away from it, all you can hear is muffled booming. After 5 days, the radio quit entirely. Boston Acoustics was non-responsive to emails and has only a toll number with long waits to speak to anyone. They say they will repair it...but I must wait for an RA...and shipping is at my expense. Not a lot of confidence in their products! Listen and compare before you buy. The Accurian only lacks an input for external devices..and it sounds more balanced."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this first HD radio effort, and I do look forward to great improvements in the technology over the next few years. The Boston Acoustics radio has been buggy for me, with power issues and also an occasional lockup requiring a ""reboot.""I have a Cambridge SoundWorks HD radio on order and I anxiously await testing that in the same scenario."
5,OMG!!!!!!,i have only dreamed of this kind of innovation. I can't believe I ever doubted it would happen! You guys at Boston rock! I'm gonna buy one as soon as i get the money. Sorry I can't right now!
2,What A Disappointment,"Boston Acoustics Receptor HD Clock Radio (Platinum)This radio does nothing well. It has trouble receiving local and HD stations, so that the sound goes in and out constantly. It has far too much bass (which cannot be adjusted)so that it is almost useless as a radio unless you are listening to something that is all about the bass line. And it doesn't always work - sometimes it turns itself off without warning (no, I am not setting it to sleep mode by accident), and loses the presets regularly. I highly recommend you stay away from this overpriced, very disappointing radio. I will certainly never buy another BA product after this experience."
1,Does not measure up,"This is a very expensive clock radio, and I bought it because of the HD capability. I was very disappointed in its reception. I placed it on the same spot on the nightstand where my $25 AM/FM clock radio had sat. The cheap radio picked up all my AM/FM stations with pretty good reception. The Boston radio could barely pick up the local PBS station. My favorite local AM station sounded like it was in another state. The engineers should go back to the drawing board. This is a very expensive radio with a very cheap reception system. It's hard to appreciate all the features of HD if you can't hear your station. I returned the radio one day after receiving it. I purchased it from Amazon and was very pleased with the entire transaction. I never hesitate to buy from Amazon because I know they will take returns with no problem. I hope I can find an AM/FM clock radio with HD that will really do the job."
3,Great Sound / So So Operation,"Gotta love the sound of HD radio. Ditto for the way the unit looks. But here is the problem: there is a glitch in the control program; I know this because I sent the unit in because of the problem and was sent a new one (different serial #) and it has the same problem. About three times out of ten when I turn the radio on there is no sound. The volume is up and the station is tuned in. If I cycle though AM, FM, Aux and back to AM everything is fine. I'm going to live with it because the sound is sooo good. Duke Masters4/18/08 Update: I have had much trouble with this $300 radio. It was replaced once and the new one has all the defects of the first one and more. I now have to slap it to get it to play. It also has to be cycled through the modes to get AM radio. The company has discontinued it and that says it all. I have asked them for a refund or credit this morning we shall see if they respond. KDM"
3,My Aunt is easily pleased with new technology,"I bought this HD Radio for my Aunt for Christmas. She was upset that Smooth Jazz was gone from the Philadelphia area for a time and couldn't find any other station she enjoyed, the HD Radio seemed like a good fix. She likes the sound quality and has found enough stations to satisfy her, but I feel the radio stations need to broadcast more HD stations with stronger signals."
2,"poorly organized, not good as a reference","I found the author spent too much time trying to be cute. The topics in the book seem to jump around rather than flow from one to another. After reading the book, and working with AppleScript I do not feel I am any further ahead. If you want to do something productive with AppleScript I would look into another book."
1,no good,"I didn't learn anything from this book.By ""covering"" Excel and Filemaker they mean two short pages.by a different book."
4,Great book!,Great hard to find book was available and in great condition! Very prompt service! The item was in better shape (for a used book) than I expected it to be as well :-)
3,Gummy Pumpkins,"I think these gummy pumpkins are great but Jelly Belly isn't carrying them this year, I live near a Jelly Belly factory/outlet store, so I'd be leery of this or any other company selling them, as they might be from last year."
2,Same Deborah who previously rated product with 5 Stars,"I feel just awful that my review of this product probably caused others to have purchased it.What I said before was true, the day I rated it. A pair of nylons holds up better than this product. It makes no sense that a company with so much going for it would choose to lose so much for so little. The styling of all their cookware is so very attractive. This set is no exception. It's beautiful, until you look a little more closely. The non-stick material just doesn't hold up at all. If it's cared for precisely as indicated in the use and care it just comes off. I feared when I read the warranty that they never intended to stand behind it-still, it was so beautiful. That beautiful red finish however, practically rubs off. Enough said. Unless your purchasing it for STRICTLY decorative purposes, DON'T."
2,Really cool looking set...BUT....,"The quality of this set is dodgy. I purchased my set, brought it home from the store, unpacked it and washed it. Noticed the next morning there were already scratches on the red exterior from simple hand washing and setting on the counter. In their information page enclosed in the packaging they recommend storing it with sheet of paper towel in between so that they don't scratch! I've used a set of Revere Ware copper clad cookware for nearly 12 years and it still looks nice. Needless to say, I packed it up and returned it to the store. If it can't handle hand washing, how will it handle cooking? Too bad....I really love the look of this set, and it had *all* the features I was looking for in a cookware set. It is far too expensive for the quality. Two stars because it looks awesome."
3,A Good Highlighter,"Just a bit on your cheekbones is all you need to add a healthy ""dewy"" glow/look...too much and it looks blotchy, unnatural, and makes your skin look dry (at least mine did)."
4,ooops - not 20 anymore,"Benefit Cosmetics High BeamI used to use this product when I was younger (much younger) and liked it very much. It highlights any place you want to draw an eye to - cleavage, shoulders, brow, etc. Forgot that a couple of decades had passed and NO, I no longer want to draw anyones eyes to my cleavage anymore! I gave it to a 29 yr. old and she LOVES it, like I used to."
2,Benefit High Beam,"I bought this hoping I would finally get the dewy look that I see on the red carpet!Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I assumed since this is a highlighter, it would be very satiny since you have to dab it on to your makeup and you need something light and soft for that.It is a very pretty color, but it sinks quickly into your skin, not giving you enough time to put it on evenly."
1,Cossacks is a rip off!,"Being an Age of Empires junkie, I bought Cossacks thinking it would be similar. I give credit to the designers and people who made the game. Cossacks has gorgeous backgrounds, beautiful buildings, and units, unfortunatly I was disappointed with how it played. The game played very slow and it takes forever to build things. More than anything I was frustrated and recieved no satisfaction from playing it."
5,its good very good,"this is one of the best games i erver played. i find it better then aoe you have more options and its easyer 2 learn the game then aoe. everyone must by this game and play it on the internet.their is an aad-on cossacks: ""art of war"" white more option and 2 nation, more units ... . just must have it in your house. their are more then 1000 players on the internet who play this game every day !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THE VERY BAD GAME,"Cassocks barly lives up to its expectations. It does not teach you to play.The built in teacher and manual don't teach.Im sure if I knew how to play I would like it,but let's face the facts, it stinks.I may be 10 years old, but I know a good game from a bad one.So it derserves a 1 star rating."
3,Almost as good as Age Of Empires,"The building, units, development of resorces and gameplay is essentially the same as AOE. The interface is confusing and difficult to manage (right/left click). The graphics are slightly better than AOE and the game is slow compared to AOE.Plus:Great campaigns.Large scale armies (much larger than AOE).Better resources management.Cons:Not as good nor fluid as AOE.Game is not as addictive as AOE or C&C or Starcraft.Overall: if you like the historical period and want to play with units of that time, this is a good game. Otherwise it's just AOE stuck in the 17th century."
3,Could be better!,"I bought this game as soon as it was released. First, I couldn't know how to start an interesting compaign. Scenarios are really boring. On the otherhand, there are lots of units and different countries with cool graphics."
4,Age of Empires Rip-Off,"I know this has probably been said but I decided to say it again. No matter how good this game was on its own I couldn't play it at all without first thinking Age of Empire. Don't get me wrong the missions are unique and challenging(sometimes enormously hard). But I somehow feel like I have played the game before. The game is wonderful and this one had the decked stacked against it from the outset, to bad.My impression-A decent game that could have been a great game"
2,Not a worthy competitor to AoK II,"I got Cossacks because I was tired of AoK II and wanted a new game in the RTS genre. I am not impressed. The big advantage that many people cite is that you can have larger armies, up to 8,000 units in the game. Unfortunately, this decision has two negative results: 1) The cannon-fodder mentality, instead of throwing dozens of units at an opponnent, you can now throw hundreds. As an example of how the game caters to this mentality, you can create 5 units in a click by holding down shift. 2) Graphics obviously must suffer as the computer is drawing 10 times as many objects. I'd say stick with AoK II."
2,Could be fun...but too much resource management,"I bought this game anticipating a very fun and enjoyable experience. How wrong did I turn out to be! This game has great graphics and a wonderful premise but the emphasis is on resource management and that detracts from the game. You have to have resources (food, gold, etc...) to create units but also to MAINTAIN them. So your resources are constantly being drained. The more units you have the faster the resources are drained. The game claims to let you have up to 8,000 units on screen (divided by the # of players) but I can't imagine how bad it would be if you had 500 or so units. The game has wonderful possibilities but this emphasis on resources takes away from what could be an enjoyable game. This game is only for those who have plenty of time (4 or so hours) to spend on a single game. It is too tedious for me to be considered fun. For this reason, I can't recommend this game."
2,Would be great but BUGGY,"This game has so much potential, but it is filled with fatal bugs and no patches have yet been announced to fix them. It constantly seizes and freezes, forcing you to reboot your whole system each time so saving often is key. However, in one hour of gaming, it froze 5 times on me, making it hardly an enjoyable experience. It is a shame that it does this, for it looks like it will be better than AOK. Nevertheless, the constant reboots are infuriating and will make me question ever buying a game from this company until I see the patches are out.For those who wonder... I have a 700 Mhz Athlon with the latest 3dFX and 128 Mgs of ram. It is less than year old and is able to easily handle such games as Baldur's Gate II, Deus Ex and Mech Warrior 4. Hence, I can only blame the game."
4,"good game, with 1 or 2 drawbacks","It's a small break from AOK, but the configuration makes it seem like SF copied off of one of Microsofts best-sellers. I like the 16-18 c. timeline, because I like the ""mass""-troop(generaly speaking) tactics. The first drawback, besides the copy of the config., is that the training costs and speed seems excessive for the time period. The other drawback is that the upkeeps seem excessive because you have to build all these mills and goldmines, and then train peasants to run them, to maintan your army. I think that its a good game, but I also think that you should vist [the website] to download the demo and play it before actually buying the full version."
2,So much work equals so much defeat,"When I first got this game I thought it would be just like a pre-colonial version of Age of Empires 2. One brutal defeat after another told me one thing: that this game was not nearly as good as AOE2. I consider myself a very good AOE player, (I can beat 4 hard enemys in less than 2 hours) but this is simply an hard. The main reason is that it's simply unrealistic. I build a whole army of soldiers and they get gunned down before they get half way to the enemy town. At the beginning this game can be fun building and gathering. Some of the missions are good also (including combat ones.) But like another reviewer said, ""This isn't strategy it's a race."" And I couldn't agree more."
2,Great game .... if it worked.,"The demo was great, and so I bought the US version. Unfortunately, many people are having problems getting the US full version to work at all. Check out the discussion groups on (...) for more information.I had to install a CD crack just to get the stupid thing working. I'd suggest waiting a couple weeks before you buy (hopefully they'll have a US patch by then)."
4,Greed will save my irresponsible brother!,"This is a cute little romp about a couple who are thrown together by the death of an aunt. The aunt's will stipulates that the nephew and companion must marry each other to inherit. The one who does not show up to the wedding inherits nothing.Normally, the sweet companion would have handed the money over, but she must save her brother from himself. He has become a smuggler underground to hide from the loans sharks that covered his gambling debts. As he is risking his life daily, the heroine decides to risk going up against the formidable lord in order to make him cry off so she can pay her brother's debts. The lord in question, however, is a worthy opponent, and hijinks and romance ensue...Fortunately, this story features likable characters, as the plot (and the heroine's and her brother's repentance for their greedy ways) seems a bit sketchy, improbable and formulaic.Enjoy!"
2,"Fah, Gad, and Syrup",Not much more to say than I found it extremely tedious just to finish the book. Somewhere beneath all the syrup and silly language there was a hint of a plot that I found sadly lacking.
5,GREAT MUSIC!!!!!!!,This is a wonderful CD. The Alley Cats take some already great songs and make them better. Wonderful catchy tunes and a great sound!
2,"Okay, but not what I expected","This CD is okay. Some tracks are quite good and cachy, such as At The Hop, but others, such as Sh-Boom, really seem to have no intelligeble meaning or beat. If you likethis lively kind of Rock, than there are better CDsyou can get. I wouldn't waste your money on this."
2,Not Typical Hagberg!,This book was certainly a letdown from other Hagberg books that I have read in the past.Not even aaltime McGarvey villain Baranov could save this book. There was little or no action in this book. This book consisted of a great deal of dialogue between McGarvey and the other characters. There are little or no action sequences that have been a trademark in other Hagberg books. This definitely must have been one of his first books.He got much better in his later writings. I know why this book is unavaliable for purchaese. It is to boring to read. Buy his other books. You will like them much better.
3,1/4 good,"This book is good up till you get 1/4 of the way through it. The first quarter of the book is good and it goes over general SNMP stuff then history different versions etc. The last 3/4 of this book cover configuring proprietary monitoring systems like open view and solar winds.I dont care about open view.. or solar winds.. i wanted to learn about snmp... not some vendors software package. Im suprised that this got published with such a general title.. when really the book is an snmp intro, followed by how to setup a proprietary monitoring tool."
2,Disappointing,Most of the books in this series are very technical and go into serious details. This one reads like a compendium of owner's manuals. A really good book on SNMP is needed and this one is not it.
3,"Good book, but where is there one for idiots?","I pretty much hate SNMP. It's stems from not understanding it. This book has given me a grasp on some of the concepts, but has refered to a few things that I am supposed to already know. It's not for beginners."
5,Excellent SNMP intro for beginners,"I got HP OV NNM 7.5 started at work on a rush due to the need of increasing proactive response to the regular problems. This book, even based on old versions of the software I have in hand came up to be very straight to the point and was full of examples that aid me to realise how SNMP works. Even when you are a seasoned sysadmin/netadmin you happen to be off the road with topics of paramount importance such as SNMP. Don't be afraid of the age, this book is great for the price, and the authors made it big. Five stars..."
5,Good Book,I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about SNMP. It was helpful and straight foward
2,"SNMP for Users, not Programmers","Essential SNMP didn't quite hit the nail for me.I needed introductory documentation on the design of MIB files and the implementation of agents, but this book provides more of a quick overview of the usage of SNMP from the perspective of a network manager.There are lots of basic examples on data collection, but researching on the internet helped me much more than this book. Especially the Net-SNMP website covers much of the internal workings of the SNMP protocol and the advanced usage of OIDs, like tables, octet string indexes and multiple indexes. But I still had to search and experiment a lot before finding the relevant information."
1,Boooooring,"Book is a collection of ""down memory lane"" pieces by some old Bulletin writers, none of whom seem to have been interested in much that occurred after about 1970, at the start of the Bulletin's last twelve years in its losing death-struggle with the Inquirer. The tired, often insipid anecdotes that these people recall are unwitting testament to the essential boring nature of the Bulletin. They all pat each other on the back a lot, too."
3,King Silk Comforter Review,"I bought this product because it was supposed to breathe and allow me to stay cool at night. I got the spring weight silk and it is extremely light but it does keep the body heat in, which is great if you get cold at night. However, I still had to throw it off of me between about 1:30 and 5 AM because I was too hot. It is a beautiful, light, silky comforter but if you get really hot at night, it's not going to work for you."
1,"If it ain't Brach's, it ain't Candy Corn","I've been eating Candy Corn all my life, and I can tell you there are a lot of companies out there packaging little yellow, red and white cone-shaped candies, but there is only one candy that is worthy of being called Candy Corn, and that's the Brach's variety. All others are posers, wannabes, johny-come-latelies. Amazon! Give me the good stuff!"
3,I'll eat 'em,"Lotsa people love to whine about whatever candy they particularly dislike, and Candy Corn is a particular target. Pshaw I say. Candy is candy. Sugar made into a plasticky form. Tastes fine. Not the sorta thing I'd buy myself, but I've eaten pounds of it over the years and will continue to do so."
4,Lots to Ponder,This book is a very good collection of material that requires a slow reading (it can be heavy/thick at times) but is well worth the time. I am far from finished but have really enjoyed the way this book causes me to think and rethink my own position and understanding of foundational theological points. This would make for very good seminary reading but anyone would benefit from reading it.
2,yeeah..not so much.,"Three years ago I bought this skillet in a cookware set. I bought it through JcPenney's and spent just over $275(including shipping) I am VERY dissapointed, although it says you can use metal utinsils DON'T,the ""non-scratch surface"" scrathes so easily.I don't do ALOT of cooking. I use them more than 3 times a week and on holidays.These pane are great if you don't do alot of cooking and are looking for something pretty just for awhile. After awhile they become incresingly difficult to clean..look clean as your washing but after they dry..take another look. So having said ALL of that...Great at first..they don't last long...dissaponting."
2,did not live up to expectations,"I purchased the smaller version of this pan (which is currently out of stock). While the directions clearly state that metal utensils CAN be used on the nonstick coating, that does not appear to be true. After only a few months of use, the cooking surface of my pan is scratched and discolored.I have a Farberware Millenium 18/10 stainless saute pan, which you really can use metal utensils on without any damage. I didn't realize that this Satin Enamel pan would be lower-quality. I don't recommend this product, though perhaps it would be more durable if you refrain from ever using metal or hard-edged plastic utensils."
5,Buen producto decorativo,"Este es un buen producto decorativo para cualquier habitacion, sobre todo para aquellos niños que les encanta los personajes de Disney como al mio, los colores son bonitos e intensos tal cual se refleja en la foto, perfecto para hacer buenas combinaciones de colores de pintura===============This is a great product to decorate a child room, specially to those child who loves Disney character as my son. This product is perfect to combine with several paint colors...."
5,About To Jump!!!,"I recently picked up a copy of this book and found it to be very helpful. Nearing graduation, I have been doing alot of research and reading before entering the work force. This was motivating and exciting, it has an easy to use approach that I hope to apply to my life over the next few months."
2,Not at all what I expected,Having tasted the mudslide flavor in a different brand -- wish I could remember the other brand now -- this one was not at all what we expected. It's got a weird taste and nobody in my family likes it.
4,Good Stuff,"I like this coffee... but I wish it had just a little more density in the chocolate flavor. I am truly hooked on Coffee Masters coffee, though. (The amaretto flavor is my favorite.) If you like a mild, chocolate essence in a good medium bodied coffee. You will like Mudslide. It's very good."
3,Nandy MRC-11X22 Channel Bike to Bike Communicator/Headset,"For a basic communication device, I feel the radio has too many function buttons. Radio works well using push-to-talk button. The supplied headset is for an open-face helmet. There is no option for a closed-face helmet headset with the initial purchase. You will need to order one separatly. With the helmet and headset I have, hearing at speed above 45mph is a problem due to wind noise. As for factory support, the question I emailed two weeks ago about the headset is still to be answered. Ride Smart."
4,good buy,"These units have a few problems but work well for the money. The units come with an external ptt button you can mount on your handlebars I had the units replaced once and the external ptt button did not work on all 4 units. It is pretty simple to reach down and hit the ptt button on the unit clipped to your belt. The units do have vox but it is slow to react so it is easier to use the ptt button. The units work both bike to bike and as an intercom, however they do not work very well as both at the same time. When 2 headsets are hooked to the same unit the headsets are in constant communication therefor the wind and engine noise is heard constantly making it difficult to hear if someone from another unit is trying to talk.I would recommend these units to anyone, I think the problems are minor and for the price they work very well."
3,Just OK,"It's good but not rugged enough. The external ptt button just doesn't work and it's difficult to listen to music when you travel with a passenger in the intercom mode.They are just ok for the price, but I was expecting a lot more."
4,Very Pretty,"I ended up ordering 3 sets of these, I liked them so much. Very nice design etched on, goes with a lot. It was a miracle that all of them arrived unbroken. I purchased from Amazon and the 2 sets I ordered last arrived with absolutely no packing materials included! They were in a box that was large enough for them to shift around in.But they survived and so far, I am very pleased with them.*Update after 2 months* I have noticed some comments about them seeming ""flimsy"" or ""thin"" and they do. However, I have used these just as I would any other everyday glasses and put them in the dishwasher where they have been rattled around and they have really held up. I suppose if you have some younger kids, they might not make it, but I am not much better than a kid myself with this stuff. I think this is a case where appearances are deceiving. Use and Enjoy!"
1,FRAGILE,ONE GLASS ARRIVED BROKEN AND THE REST ARE SO THIN THAT THEY ARE NOT PRACTICAL. WE WILL HAVE ALL OF THE OTHER 11 BROKEN SOON. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. ANOTHER POOR PACKING JOB BY AMAZON (ALMOST NO PACKING) AND 26 DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN.
5,yes!,"We purchased these knobs for a dresser...we had purchased some about a year ago, and couldn't find any to match them. This was a fabulous price, excellent service, and the knobs are awesome!"
1,Total misrepresentation,I purchased a bag of Nutro Ultra Small bree dog food for 34.00. It was not Nutro Ultra and the bag was the size of a 17.99 size that I could have purchased at Petsmart. So much for great prices.....I bASICALLY PAID DOUBLE AND IT WASN'T WHAT I ORDERED!!!!!!!!
2,Leaves more streaks than it removes,"I've been having very bad experiences with my klear screen fluid on my 20"" Apple Cinema Display. Every time I try to use it, the screen ends up looking more smudged and streaked than it did when it started out. The fluid evaporates so quickly that it's nearly impossible to spread it around with the cloth before it dries and leaves more smudges on the screen. When I spray again to remove those smudges I just get more elsewhere."
3,"Okay, Ive seen better","This work is a well written primer to log home building, covers all major points of building, but does not go far into depth. Tends to strongly discourage owner-builders (although this may not be a bad thing. This is more difficult than a bird house.) This book is far from a step by step construction manual. For the curious may be a good pace to start."
3,building log homes,I was disappointed in this book because it did not give enough info. on any one subject that I was looking for.
4,log home from scratch or kit,i think this bok was the one of best books i ever got on log home it show you all differnt ways to build and there are some many really nice pic so you cane see what they are doing. i think this book is worth the money
3,Amazon! Do something about this!,"The price of this item ($10) is excellent--adjustable ballcaps usually are in this range, but specialty, low-selling versions like this one tend to run higher.However, the shipping cost of $10 is scandalous! Amazon! Wake up and talk to these people!"
5,Purchased as a gift,"My Father in law made the ""honor flight"" to DC. This will make his trip the best it can be."
4,Vietnam Veteran Baseball Caps,"The gentlemen in the Chapter liked them very much. Nice material, good fit. I do wish they were made in America instead of China!"
5,An Unexpected Hug and a Lot of Talk,"When my husband first wore his spiffy newMilitary Caps Vietnam Veteran Logo Baseball Cap, a nice-looking young woman approached him with tears in her eyes and gave him an enthusiastic hug. ""Thanks for all you did,"" she excalimed as she backed away. The hat has been a real conversation starter; I never realized how many veterans there are in our midst -- and each one has a story to share."
4,Vietnam Veteran Cap mismatch,"I order 2 because these caps are hard to find. After recieving the items I noticed they did not look like the pictures at all no ribbons in the middle, no text on the bill either. what I got was a black hat with gold wreaths which is not what was expected but the end product was made from great quality. All in all a great hat to show off."
5,This guy is amazing. Buy this and see him live if possible.,"Really. This album is so good and deep and dark. Robert Johnson channeling Flannery O'Connor? Trent Reznor processed by the Blind Boys of Alabama? Whatever -- it's great. And live, he ALMOST eclipsed Lucinda Williams. Almost. :)"
4,Comfy sandal,"I really like how these sandals are made. the quality is impecable. the only reason i give it 4 stars is because you have to make sure you buy a size larger than your kid's real size. They are better for a medium foot width rathen than wide (as it is with my son). however, my son liked it very much and I wish it came in my size :)."
5,Great Pan - Great Value!,"I adore this pan. I cook a lot of one-pan/pot meals and this is the perfect pan for that. Nice & deep for fried chicken. Great non-stick surface, nice tight-fitting lid. This is a great utilitarian pan. I reach for it all the time, and it hasn't disappointed me yet."
5,"Great ""BULLY"" T-Shirt!","This is one AWESOME shirt and a ""Must Have"" for any ""HUMAN"" that is owned by a ""BULLDOG""! Not only is this shirt EXCELLENT quality, the graphics are just TOO CUTE! It actually looks alot like our ""Harry""! lol...Seller was AWESOME...Fast Shipping and VERY professional! Perfect Transaction all around!"
4,I want to read a sequel!,"For a first time writing a book, Mr. Paton did a wonderful job.This book left me wanting more. I truely hope that David Patoncomes out with a sequel to this book. Deffinately a book that you won't be able to put down. Grammatical errors? Not many of them and that did not detract from my reading."
5,very interesting,I really enjoyed Secrets in the Attic. It kept me wondering what was going to happen next and the author's good imagination and description of every detail held my interest till the very end. Thank you for writing this great book. It made me think alot about our future and how our generations are truly connected. We truly do have a purpose in this life.
4,Good reading!,David's book really kept my interest. I couldn't wait to read what would happen next. Very imaginative. Full of adventure. I can't wait for his next book.
2,"Editing help, Please!","This book had good potential. The story itself is good, but the author needs serious help with his writing technique and editing. Many grammatical errors were distracting...it just needs help to gain any more stars."
3,Great artist deserves a better compilation,"Colonel Abrams was the artist in the 80's for 'those in the know'. He was big in R&B circles but never really crossed into the mainstream (which must have been due to promotion as he was talented enough!).I was glad to see this compilation, as in record stores it was hard to find a CD that included all of his work that I remembered listening to on the radio, and hearing in clubs.Here is why I don't give the CD 5 stars: the mixes aren't that great. Perhaps I am a product of New York radio, but I remember stronger versions out there of songs like 'Speculation', and I was dissapointed to learn that they weren't what was placed in this CD."
4,COLONEL ABRAMS MISSING MAJOR HIT,"WHILE THIS CD OFFERS THE UTMOST OF COLONEL'S HITS IN RARE FORM, ONE CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE HIS BIG HIT AND PROBABLY HIS FIRST ONE ""MUSIC IS THE MESSAGE"" IS NOT ON THIS CD. WITH MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME LEFT ON THIS CD, YOU MEAN TO TELL ME SUCH A BIG DANCE CLASSIC IS NOT ON THE ONLY COMPILATION THAT EH HAS OUT! WHO'S IDEA WAS THIS?"
5,The Colonel's best.,"Like Alexander O'Neal, James ""D Train"" Williams and Kashif, Colonel Abrams was able to effortlessly meld his classic soul and gospel-flavored singing style with high-tech 1980s R&B/Club beats with great commercial success. Abrams was obviously influenced strongly by such legendary R&B vocalists as Teddy Pendergrass and The Dells' Murvin Junior--something which becomes convincingly clear on the classics ""Trapped"", ""Speculation, ""The Truth"", ""How Soon We Forget"" and the luscious ballads ""Margaux"", ""Table For Two"" and ""Never Change"". A classic collection from one of the 1980s most important male R&B singers."
4,"""I'm Glad to have Colonel Abrams CD from Amazon!""","As an Amazon customer, I'm glad to have purchased the Best of Colonel Abrams from Amazon since alot of stores, warehouses etc., no longer sell or have it in stock! My favorite hit grooves are ""TRAPPED,"" ""NOT GONNA LET YOU GET THE BEST OF ME,"" and ""HOW SOON WE FORGET."" I enjoy the lyrics, extended groove sounds and beats from back in the early 1990's! So, all you Colonel Abrams fans who haven't gotten this CD should get one while it's available. You will truly enjoy this one! Bye the way, whatever happened to Mr. Colonel Abrams and is he still making music?Tanya ""The Queen""Takoma Park, MD"
2,cd,really like the original recordings that you hear on the radio...but this cd is a re-recording that just doesnt sound the same...but still a pretty good cd
4,all around good cd,"The style of this group reminds me slightly of the ataris. i think it is becuase the lead singer kinda sounds like him...but that is just my opinion. i only gave this cd a four star rating. i like the lyrics and the music but i have noticed that a couple of the songs sound the same if u listen to them enough. all the songs rock, however. and the one thing i like is that i can play it in front of my parents w/out getting them ... off. the lyrics are pretty original and so their music. i like the intro's to the songs. they are very cool. it is one of the more mellow punk cds i have. u should get this cd. o and get it off off amazon. it is waaaaaay cheaper than anywhere else."
5,THEY LOVED THEM!!,Purchased as gifts for my brother in law and the NANA one for my sis...made an excellent Christmas gift!! The sizes were perfect...I just ordered the wrong size for my brother in law but the exchange was a breeze...
5,Four Ingredients Cookbook,"Was very impressed with the cookbook. It appears to be unused, although it was advertised as slightly used. The recipes are easy to follow and I really enjoy it."
5,A ton of usable recipes,"I picked this one up for a dollar at the grocery store, and have made so many recipes out of it. My grocery bill has been under $50 the last two weeks. Many of the recipes throw together really easy and then take a while to cook, so I'm able to get dinner done and in the oven and the kitchen cleaned before the arsenic hour. Great collection! Would also recommend the one armed cook.The One-Armed Cook: Quick and Easy Recipes, Smart Meal Plans, and Savvy Advice for New (and Not-So-New) Moms"
1,YUCK!!!! Just a BAD book!,"After trying 2 recipes, I thought that I was a pretty bad cook. So, I asked my friend, a very good cook, to try a couple more recipes. She had the same results. Disgusting!! These recipes must not have been kitchen tested. Mine as well just boil some chicken and dump a can of cream of mushroom soup on top. The results would be better. Stay away!"
2,Beautiful but NOT functional,"This is a beautiful tea kettle, however, it has some annoyances and some major flaws. The annoyances are that the handle does get hot and the whistle needs to be removed before pouring. The flaws are that if you do not fill the kettle completely before boiling water, the spout gets very hot and when you pour, boiling water spatters all over the place. On one occasion, so much steam had built up as a result of the hot spout, that the lid popped off and burned my hand. Be very careful when you use this kettle and make sure to fill it to the edge of the spout before using."
2,Beware of the spout . . .,"I received the tea kettle as a gift. It is nice looking and the tea pot seems well-made except for the cheap plastic spout. The plastic spout wears out rapidly and eventually the whistle falls out. As I view a working whistle as a safety feature, I am now on the lookout for a replacement spout, but have been unsuccessful thus far. So you end up with a $50 stainless steel tea pot compromised by a 25 cent part . . ."
4,Pretty good at the right price,"Had hoped the design would have a very cool handle and be ""heat friendly"". Reality is handle does get hot and the whiste spout must be removed with a cloth before pouring. That said, it is very pretty and well made. I paid $55.00 with shipping so I am happy."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for its lovely style, and presumed that Eva Zeisel would guard her reputation as an industrial designer. It looks good, and the stainless finish holds up and cleans up beautifully. But, it has major problems. The handle gets too hot to use without a potholder, and in the three years we have had it, the handle began to deform and finally to begin breaking apart. The whistle, which others have mentioned is long gone. More significantly than those defects, however, is the problem mentioned above of the water bursting out of the spout all over the place. That is a design flaw that makes me wonder about Zeisel's concern for functionality. Oh, well, she lasted a very long time. Form counts for a lot in my view, and she did many wonderful looking things. So, I'm moving on to another Eva for my next kettle--Eva Solo. It's gorgeous, I'll let you know how it works.Eva Solo XO Stainless Steel Kettle, 1-1/2-Liter"
5,None Better,"This record, and the Supersuckers in general are cocky, genius, hard rock that can't be beat. Just shut up and enjoy it already. These boys deserve more beer money, and more encouragement from rock fans in general. See them live - you WILL have fun, and {you} WILL be rocked."
4,"Not great, but good.","I have every Supersuckers album and I love them. This album didn't really impress me with the first listen, but it's grown on me. It's a solid album. If you like 'em, you have to get it. It may not be great, but it's still better than most of the stuff that tries to pass itself for rock n roll these days."
5,Hilarious,"Non stop laughter!! If you are a fan of Mike Epps, you will love Tony Roberts. This dude is hilarious from beginning to end. I was weak throughout the whole dvd. Tony has been doing stand up for years but of lately he's been getting more recognition. Long overdue in my opinion! Don't sleep on this dvd...buy it! Definitely your money's worth. As for the seller, no complaints and shipping was fast. Will buy from this seller again in the near future."
1,Tony Roberts Wired,This is not comedy. He is funny every 7-8 minutes sporadic at best. Laughs at himself more than the audience. This is truly sad! Don`t waste your money!!!
4,"Great DVD, but...","It was missing some parts from the stand-up on TV. I have the cable version on DVR. I was a little disappointed that my favorite part of the stand-up was not on there. Other than that, GREAT!"
5,Least piece is best piece.,"As always, McPhee's work is a zenith of style. But, in this collection, his shortest piece is his most fascinating. For, who is this mysterious ""Rinard at Manheim,"" whose knowledge and wit are at least equal to the author's?"
4,Great book!,This book is excellent for the beginning Excel 2002 user. It's written in an easy-to-read and understand format and includes numerous exercises which build on and help reinforce the learning concepts.I teach MS Office classes in a community college and have used this book in my classes. My students have no difficulty following along with the step-by-step instructions and can even use the text for self-study.Practical Excel 2002 also makes a great reference book for those times when you just can't remember the steps needed to perform a task or if you want to brush up on your skills.I highly recommend this book.
2,Didn't fit as well as original pre filter,"Prompt shipping and good quality material, but it didn't fit as well as the one it was replacing. It didn't have a cut to fit around the power cord."
2,Interesting but lacking substance...,"Last year at the age of 40, I finally discovered that there is a word for the way I've always been...Polyamorous. Until I discovered the word I honestly didn't know that there were so many other souls that find loving and being sexually intimate with more than one person simulateously a natural occurance, and I struggled constantly with feelings of guilt and confusion. Mystic's take on polyamory from a spiritual perspective is right on target for my own experiences, but the book did not really help me learn anything that I didn't already know or feel. If you're looking for a book to educate you about polyamory, this isn't the book. This book seems to be more of a very short summary of Mystic's philosophy of spiritual poly and less about the nuts and bolts of living that lifestyle in a primarily monogamous society."
5,Blessed,I had the pleasure of hearing this group minister at our church. They are truly blessed and are able to mezmorize listeners with the word of God. Every member of the group brings a special voice and together they blend so incredibly.
5,Long Time User,"I bought my first bottle of Jai'Ose in 1980 and love it just as much now as when I first smelled the fragrance back then.I'm a firm believer that a persons own body chemistry plays a big part in how a fragrance will smell but I have to admit that everyone who has loved Jai'Ose on me has also loved it on themselves. I receive compliments from complete strangers when I wear it. My 21 year old daughter now makes a joke out of it as she has heard it all her life when going places with me.I'm horrible at trying to explain what a fragrance smells like so I'll leave that at what the product information has said. However I can promise you if you like the smells of Jasmine, Patchouli, Cedar, Musk and Sandalwood I think you will love Jai'Ose.*Please note that the info here by Amazon says it is made by Dior and launched 2000 however it is made by Guy Laroche of Paris launched in 1977. Also my list of fragrances are the correct ones. I have contacted Amazon about the error."
3,A little disappointed,"Product arrived soon and smells great. However, sprayer is not working and only drips out. Wishing I new I could send it back. However, I've thrown the receipt and packaging away."
1,More hype than secrets,"Most of the info in this book can be found in the Windows98 help files. The few scant ""secrets"" that are mentioned could fill maybe one or two honest book-sized chapters. Perhaps by making the book over-bloated they felt justified at the over-bloated price. Do not fall for this scheme. Save your money."
2,Not very helpful. Seems obsessed witn Windows 3.1,"I spent 3 hours looking for a way to change the contents of my desktop tray, to no avail. Then I looked for a way to contact the authors - to no avail. In reading thru the book looking for useful advice, it seemed that practically every discussion and explanation used Windows 3.1 as a reference. I guess if you are seeped in Windows 3.1, that might be useful, but it wasn't to me.I agree with other reviews - the featured areas of Windows seem odd and random, not based on the kinds of things users need to know."
1,Phone are a dud,Bought these phones for a Christmas present and they did not work correctly...you cannot understand what they are saying when you push the buttons. Seller was great. Full refund and told us to toss the phones...don't bother sending them back.
4,Cute Phone,This is a neat concept but it needs something... My daughter loves it and carries it around in her purse all the time. we have lost a couple of the face plates so we can't talk with some of the princesses any more. maybe that is what it needs a small carrying case that is attached to the back of the phone. but it's fun and everyone here get a kick out of talking with the princesses!
4,Very fine book by fellow traveler in Revisionist truth...,A slim volume but a very good contributionto our biblical understanding of the condi-tional-ness of the Israel 'is the god's chosenpeople' thought. R.I.P Chuck Provan. Lookfor Chuck's other books on amazon.com
4,Fun,"A truly different and unusal comedy - everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask as to what a man can do with with his ""equipment"". These guys take what could be pornography and turn it into a most unusual comedy act. It's all there for you to see - yes they show just about everything. Once you get past the ""shock"" that you will see male genitalia (and in closeup) and start ""laughing with the audience"" you can have a real fun experience. I saw the show and the DVD put me in a better seat that if I were in a front row seat! Half the fun is the reaction of the audience to the ""tricks"". It actually becomes good clean fun for those who will not be offended by the nudity and the fact that these are two guys playing (literally) with themselves and enjoying it. This is not a video you would probably watch often but it is a great ""party-type"" video - something to show your friends who think they have seen it all."
3,Dick Tricks,"While searching for the ""Vagina Monologues"" I saw this DVD and thought I should give equal time to male genitalia.Well, it is a hoot and a half though not particularly lengthy (no pun intended.) You may frequently avert your eyes, as does the live audience, but you will have to look again and again. This is a unique and amusing act, but not for the squeamish or easily offended."
2,Stretches the material,"Having heard so much about this show, I certainly expected more. The show runs 50 minutes and at least 30 of those are redundant audience shots, swarmy or silly stage chatter and other assorted time-fillers. The ""tricks"" themselves aren't that spectacular: women and men may be uncomfortable watching them, but for very different reasons. The guys themselves are nothing special to look at and their equipment, apart from its (hmmm) elasticity, is nothing remarkable either. For a commercial release, the stage show video is poorly filmed and directed. The picture is subpar, the music is annoying jokey and the direction usually cuts to the audience before it shows you the dick trick everyone's laughing at uproariously. Slightly more interesting, but only slightly, is an added documentary on how the show was put together and the casting for a replacement company."
2,puppets suffer from boredom,"Although some of the gags are kind of cute, overall the film lacks a decent patter. There is too much focus on the audience reaction. Overall, I got bored half way through the program. It was not that the puppetry wasn't interesting and funny, but the guys aren't funny at all. They seem to be quite amused at themselves, but I couldn't find their chatter anything but dull."
3,"Seen One, You've Seen them All-But They Didn't Do This!","The two guys manage to make the show funny and entertaining without it feeling ""dirty"".Having said that, you sure don't want to watch it with your kids present- it is total male nudity and they use that ""male nudity"" like a clown with balloons to make all sorts of shapes-really! (The first trick made every guy in the room grimace!)It's a fun adult party movie, although a bit too long. After you've seen a guy make a sailboat and a hamburger on a bun..."
3,Questions?,"I have read and enjoyed the other 2 in this series. I really like the other series that Ms. Huff writes. I have only one question- why do there have to be lesbian influnences in this one? The attraction of a Keeper and another female character does not add to the story being convayed. (Was it to make the book PC?) The cats are the best characters in this book!! As usual, their comments pace the story and add a great deal of interest. All that being said, I did enjoy this addition to the ""Summoning"" series."
3,SADLY---not as good as its predecessors,"Don't take me wrong. It's not a bad book. It's certainly worth reading if you really enjoyed the first two, but..... Maybe it's the lack of novelty. The book lacks a certain *something*The first book was charming in its novelty. The cutting insight of Austin....Hell talking to itself...It felt fresh and fascinating. In The Long Hot Summoning, the narrative seemed more forced, less natural.Unfortunately for fans of the series, Tanya said publicly at a conference that it is likely this is the last of The Keeper books. This makes me sad since this book is not of the same quality as the first two."
5,The Last Hurrah in the series,"I love this series (As you may have read if you checked out reviews for the first two books) but the last installment is the weakest. I miss Austin and Sam is just not as good at being a cat (albeit he does have less experience). This books focuses more on the younger keeper, Diana, which is okay but the first two book were mostly about Claire and she doesn't get enough time in this one. If the series was more than three books (and I really wish it was) then this installment would be fine, but it's the last so I wanted what I fell in love with- Claire, Austin, and Dean.That being said this book lacks nothing in the humor and sarcastic wit of the first two. These book make me crack up again and again and I have read the series at least 4 times now. I definately reccommend if you would like a fun, hilarious trip with those who keep the rest of us from knowing just how often our world almost ends. Make sure to read the first two beofre this one!!!"
4,"Interesting, but not as good as 2nd Summoning","Most of this story deals with the adventures of the younger sister from the first two ""Summon"" novels. Diverting, but the dialog is somewhat predictable and shallow, compared to the first two. I think if she writes a 4th ""Summon"" novel, this will improve."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This product is a low budget low quality item. What I received in the mail should have been sent back for poor quality. I just didn't want the hassle. The digital screen didn't display the numbers correctly, reception is poor from the antenna and the speakers are poor. I kept it because it can play my CDs."
4,Great lil system.,I bought this for my mom and she loves it. It sounds really clear and I love the fact that it is not that big. Great buy. I would recommend it.
3,CUTE==BUT POOR VOLUME ......,IT'S A NICE LOOKING SIZE SYSTEM GREAT FOR A SMALL AREA. BUT I WASN'T TO HAPPY WITH THE AMOUNT OF VOLUME....
3,Has its Pros and Cons,"After 6 months of daily use the Pros are: nice sound, nice looking, compact with the bonus of separate speakers to spread out sound. The two surprise Cons I'm willing to put up with for the price: 1) the sound does not go beyond moderately high, and 2) you need both the remote and the system to access everything. For instance only the remote has volume control so a few times when I've lost track of the remote its been annoying. Other than that I like it in my small bedroom for morning music and news and a CD, casette or ballgame on the radio now and then."
1,Recieved it broken,"It's not the product's fault I give this a bad review, just the fact that it came in broken from the company I bought it from."
1,no stars! Had to return TWO of these which arrived not working for TWO different reasons!,JUNK! Ordered one had to return it as defective upon arrival. The replacement arrived defective for a different reason.
3,Mini CD Player SYstem,The unit arrived in a timely manner. Easy to set up. On the 5th usage (previously run probably 1 hour total time) we turned it on....smoke came billowing out of the top of the unit with a strong smell of burning plastic and POOF it worked no more. We contacted Customer Service and they finally agreed to mail out a replacement unit and then we would return the burned up unit. It arrived in about 7-10 days and so far have not used it. Am afraid it too will burn up. We were thankful we hadn't left it running when we went out to shop. Could have been a disaster! Just a fluke..defective item? Who knows?
1,Cheap piece of junk,"CD Player totally useless. Once a cd was inserted, not only did it not play, it was impossible to retreive the cd without destroying the player!I ordered two, returned one and trashed the other. I will not order from this company again."
4,Mini Stereo,"Great little Stereo, 50amp compact stereo works great. Volume, #1 to 30, I run on #14 its by my computer desk. We live in the Missouri Ozarks so AM radio weak, close stations clear, Music, half volume sounds real good, I'am 70years young, Bass Boast helps. Well pleased with Stereo, Price, Size,"
1,Waste of Money!,"My sister bought this from Circuit-City and paid $120! After about six weeks of intermittent use she started having trouble. Unit would not power up. C-C refused refund or replacement since it was over 30 days since purchase. I opened it up to attempt to find the problem but it was not worth repairing.Junk! Poor quality. Coby customer service non-existant! She bought a Sony from Amazon and it is far superior. Stay FAR away from Coby junk.Remember Spark-O-Matic from the '70s? This is the same ""quality"""
1,About Coby CX-CD 410 Mini Stereo System,I was very much disappointed with this product. The AM/FM tuner was the only functioning feature and that poorly. I will not purchase a Coby product again.
2,Disappointing,"After only a few months, the tape player started making a loud hum and then started eating my tapes. I switched to using the CD player, but it no longer recognizes that a CD is in it. I just put it out on the sidewalk for the junkman. If anyone knows of a company still making a small combination CD, tape, and clock radio, please let me know!"
2,Not a serious gardeners book but pretty,"Nice coffee table photos, except for one terrible page, but I wish I'd spent my money on something else. The content was not focused on 'tranquil', it covered a little on lots of garden themes. The writing just fills up the spaces. I wanted exactly what the title promised, I'll probably never use it."
4,St. Lunatics EP,I think that it is an amazing cd. I think that nelly and St. Lunatics are an amazing combo!!! I think that anyone that likes nelly should really consider purchasing this cd!!!!
3,Vale la pena leerlo,"Una interesante aventura en donde se refleja el principio de la realizacion de todo sueno o proyecto que es comenzarlo sin importar si es o no posible realizarlo, solo a medida que transcurre el tiempo se dan las condiciones llevarlo a cabo. Como historia es muy interesante, pero el estilo de redaccion, sus constantes referencias al auto (con lo cual se llega a pensar que sin el auto no hubieran llegado a destino porque fue la pieza clave en la aventura), la constante repeticion de frases, su visible exaltacion del yo personal y la exagerada demostracion de sentimentalismos lo hacen un poco pesado de leer. Es entendible que fue escrito a medida que realizaban el proyecto pero estaria bien que fuera revisado por un editor y estilista literario. En general un evento digno de admirar, quizas de repetir, pero como obra literaria le hace falta bastante."
3,Don't buy this,"I was swayed by the promise of playing a burned DVD right out of camera. and now I wish I had stuck to my old analog Video (Hitachi) which never gave me any trouble.It's the DVDs that are full of errors. I went to Europe with this camera and out of 8 disks , 6 could not be read!! Worst still they can not be played straight on DVD.Do not waste your money on this, instead buy a cheaper miniDV camera."
2,Hitachi 550 not 580,I don't know how many changes have been made in the manufacturing process from model 550. But buyer beware that with the digital media - there are often many errors - like there are when you write a music cd. These write errors cause the data to be lost - I went on vacation and only 4 of the 6 discs I brought were usable after because of random writing errors that occured pretty randomly.I would recommend waiting for this technology to get the kinks out or going with a different manufacter.
5,Something Awesome Even Better,"The last edition of Hated was pretty awesome, however with the little extras this time, it's even better. There's actually commentaries now (one by Merle Allin and Dino, the other by Todd Phillips), and the rest of the extras are pretty cool as well. The interview with Merle and Dino makes the whole price worth it IMO. There's a cool slide show of the submissions from the cover art contest submitted by fans, though some background music would've made it cooler.I haven't had any problems with my disc thus far, so I can't comment on the manufacturing error, but this edition is awesome and well worth it.And as far as the other post, I can't STAND Chicken John's guitar playing, especially live. Bill Weber helped to make that trademark Murder Junkies feel. He made the band's sound change from a goofy garage band to what they tried to be the whole time: BRUTAL. You can't have lyrics as violent as GG's and goofy leads played poorly."
5,A Commentary on the nuclear-aged rockstar,"G.G. Allin lived a life. This documentary portrays a living, breathing anti-hero for the forgotten, irreverant, those of us who wish we could live a life of ""no laws, no limits""."
5,WTF?,"I am GG Allin. You are GG Allin. Deep down inside each us the is a little GG Allin. Get your Burbury slippers out, make some popcorn and cuddle close to the old lady and enjoy this masterpieces of fecal."
1,Stupid crap for the mental brain damaged,"Why anyone would want to watch this crap from some retard is beyond me.My guess is that most of his followers are drug addicts,loners unable to have any relationship with females,and 25+ males that are unable to grow into mature adults,so they try to stay 16,and most likely still live with their parent{or at least depend on their parents paying their bills}.Shun this crap like a leper!"
1,Sad,"Its sad and wrong that someone would do that to themselves and its sad and wrong that people watched and suported him. I can't believe anyone would want to watch this. It's a shame he didn't kill himself sooner. If you like complete trash then you will enjoy this, but if you're not half retarded then don't go near this garbage."
2,Not so hardcore,When I first saw Hated I was 14 years old and hadn't been exposed to many people like GG. I've been meaning to buy the DVD for years and finally did a couple weeks ago. Seeing it again (I'm 19) it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was. It's still really gross but I was expecting grotesque.I sound really disturbed. Ha ha.
4,As Hard-core as it Gets,"If you are the type of person that finds extreme personalities interesting, then this film is for you. If you've heard of G.G. Allin... everything you've heard is true, and most of it is in this film. However, if you can get past the initial cringe of what is presented here, what emerges is a funny and interesting film.In particular the interviews with Allin and his brother, Merl, are fascinating. Especially noteworthy is how articulate the latter can be and the insight that he provides on his sociopathic brother. Moreover, the mayhem that was Allin's live show is largely preserved in this documentary. Thus, if you are only attracted to the anarchy that surrounded Allin, and are less interested in abnormal psychology, you will probably still consider this DVD worth your money. I do not reccomend this DVD to anyone who is EASILY OFFENDED or anyone who has a WEAK STOMACH."
5,"GG ALLIN, ROCK AND ROLL AT ITS WORST","Born Jesus Christ Allin/Died GG Allin.The vile and disturbing antics of this social outcast brought to us on video thanks to this student film/documentary. An award winning portrail of the life and death of the world's most hard core punk ever to set foot on stage.You've heard stories about Ozzy bighting the heads off of bats and stomping puppies. How about GG defficating on his fans, insighting riots, and fighting at shows as much he sang! All this and more are seen in ""Hated"".In fact, most of his shows ended in either his arrest, or issuing of warrants for it. Although many of GG's views and actions may seem a bit extreme, he represented the views of the revolutionary American Youth. Hope you're stay in hell is less miserable than it was on earth GG!"
5,GG ALLIN is GOD!,"For all the kiddies who rant & rave about that sissy Marilyn Manson,check this video out & see who had the ""balls"" to do what he says."
5,hated,"this documentary is the best one ever seen, the only true rock 'n roller, seeing is believing!!!kim"
2,The sponge attachment eventually fell apart & the Facial Tool stopped working.,"I purchased this system at a ""Bed, Bath, and Beyond"" store. I used it, and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System. However, not too long after using the system, problems did occur. The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down & eventually fell apart...And there's really no way to order a replacement. The other problem was that the actual Facial Tool eventually stopped working. I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries, although when I put new batteries in, it still did not work. So the only thing left that still works is the Facial Steamer."
2,The mist is very weak!,"I bought this product to deal with my daughter's acne thinking that the vapor was going to open her pores. No such luck! The mist was so weak that hardly had any effect on her face (she almost didn't break a sweat). So if your goal is to open those pores to extract blackheads, save your money and use the old method of placing boiling water in a pot and cover your head with a towel. The only benefit was the electric facial brush which works fine."
4,4.5 stars,"I have to say that I would have given this product 5 starts, however the timer didn't work right out of the box. But other than that which to tell you the truth I don't really don't care about... This product is wonderful. My face feel super clean and hydrated every time. I was worried at first by other reviews of it not getting hot enough, but it produces the right amount of steam and heat. I even had to take my face out a bit to cool off. Over all I LOVE this product and would recommend anyone getting one to pamper your self a bit at home."
2,disappointing,The sauna part of this is great however the facial brush is crap. I even contacted the company about how much of a pain this is and they made suggestions that were common sense and things I had already tried. I barely use the brush because it slings the face wash everywhere. I should have spent more and purchased a higher quality product. Won't be doing that again.... Save you money and buy something worth it!
3,Steam is very low,The Steamer is okay to use...It takes nearly 10min to steam and the steam is also very low...The brushes provided are very rough...I felt like its hurting my skin.The sauna system works more like a humidifier rather than a facial sauna.
1,Don't waste your money!,This product does not produce enough steam to do anything. It is useless! I am sending it back! Save your money.
1,Not enough steam,Does not produce enough steam. Use a pot of boiling water and it would be better than this lousy system. Waste of my money.
4,pleased,"I am pleased with this product for the price. The face cleaners are an added xtra. Cleans my face exceptionally well before a shave. Perfect for what I needed it for. Getting my sinuses opened is an extra benefit. The timer is great too. Overall, I cant complain and I'm happy with this product."
3,"Not enough steam, water container is too small.","You almost have to put your face really close to the bottom to feel any type of steam. Even then, all you feel is heat, not steam. My mom bought one back in the 80s that really steams and did the job. It was working really well and held alot of water and when I was sick, I would even use it as a humidifyer in my room. But this particular one only hold about 1/8 cup of water. You can't even put green tea or any kind of herbs in it."
5,Wanted to not like it - BUT it is AWESOME - get it - you wont regret,1st - I saw some reviews complaining about plastic smell (with some other saunas also) - DO THIS: wash it with soap & warm water before you use it.As for the quality - you get a lot of bang for money - the included automatic brush works real nice & you probably don't need $200 clarisonic if you use this for cleaning - 2nd brush work real nice for applying moisturizerSauna itself - double whammy - good for your face skin + good for your breathing. Facial sauna is probably the Best thing you can do to clean your pores - you can apply scrub or pore cleaner after for best results.Also - what goes very nicely with this set is to get a small bottle of Essential oils (I use 10ml peppermint with just a few drops)
1,Not much steam,"This didn't put out much steam, and wasn't very hot. Maybe it's because I'm in the mountains and water produces steam at a lower temp. up here. Anyway, I had a better facial with a pot of boiling water, and had to return this. UPDATE 2011: Want steam??? Use a ""My little steamer"" mini clothing steamer!!! CAUTION: Keep at least 12-15 inches away from your face. I used distilled water, and this thing really puts out steam, and in less than a minute too! Remember...do not put it too close to your face!!! It generates VERY HOT STEAM!!!"
3,Conair Facial Sauna,I bought this home facial steamer as an alternative to going to a spa for facials. The steam is not very dense and I find it uncomfortable holding my head above it for the set amount of time needed. It wasn't very expensive so I am still happy with my purchase. It is nice to put essential oils in the water for added relaxation. I put lavender and tea tree oil.
2,Worked for about six months,"I'm glad some people are getting what they need out of this product, but my story is a little different. This inexpensive steamer worked pretty well for about six months. The receptacle for water was quite small and I didn't feel like the steam was dispensing at as wide a range as I would like. It took a long time to heat up and the steam wasn't all that hot. Eventually, it just quit heating at all I didn't feel ripped off because it cost so little, but I agree with another reviewer here... heat up a pot of water on your stove, throw a towel over your head and buy something else with your money."
2,weak,I've only used it once. It's too weak. It's just sitting in my room collecting dust. Don't bother buying it.
3,Steam not that strong,"I've been using this steamer for 6 months. If you are looking for strong steaming action, this is NOT the product for you. The only way I could get a good steam was to put a towel over my head while using it. Some days it steams really well and other days it doesn't. Not sure why this happens. I don't steam for more than 11 minutes and it works okay. The warm up takes a few minutes (make sure you have the water in before turning it on because doing the opposite may not produce a good steam before the beep). The quality is good and it has held up for me so far. I don't use the accessories (brush etc). I wish it steamed a bit stronger and was more consistent day to day. All in all it does what it's suppose to."
5,Works Great,"I love this thing. That only thing I can say that i dislike about it is the loud beep it makes. It serves its purpose and steams your face. I also like the scrubber it comes with to use after. Technically you could boil a pot of water and stick your head over it, but this way is much nicer."
1,Poor,Not happy at allPoor quality it's a toy saunaIt's a rip offIts some thing out of a happy meal boxDo not order this product wast of time and moneySeller refunded my money and told me to throw waySauna
3,"comme la, comme sa","Ok - for those who want to do a general facial sauna. The gadgets can be safely thrown away, the nose-apapter is useless. Takes some time to start up and in my case the timer does not work. Don't want to be harsh, since it might very well be only for me but the bottom-line is a crude cheap product which I WILL ADVICE to purchase if you're looking for a simple model doing just that steaming to your face and you're ready to wait for 10 min. while the stuff heats up."
2,facial sauna,the product was vwey dissapointing the resovor was too smalland steamer was very weak. I want to return this product pleasee-mail me how to return it ASAP also I havent recived the visa card nor the statement. I don't want to incure any late charges.
1,Conair Facial sauna,This is a piece of junk. I bought two of them . one was a mistake and I couldn't find any way of deleting the second one. I was charged for both and they came on time. But they are useless.Don't buy this. The thing takes awhile to warm up and the steam in of no use. Sincerely Wanda Rinehart.
2,CONAIR FACIAL SAUNA,"I am very happy with the subject Sauna. However I am very unhappy with the tardy delivery as it was to be a Christmas present. The product was originally scheduled to be delivered on December 21, 2006. I received it on January 2, 2007.Margaret Espino"
3,Conair MDF2R Facial Sauna,The instructions...or lack there of...was/is a real problem. I still have some pieces in the package which are not identified. Were the instructions written in China or were some of the sentences or paragraphs deleted???
2,uhhh . . NOT as i thought,"Well it`s a you can say ""okay"" product.But basically it`s cheap & it would never be something im always going to usei feel like it just burn`s my face and i dont see ANY steama waste of money . . ."
4,Steam Inhaler,"This was a replacement for an old warm steam inhaler.I like the purpose of warm steam for sinus relief,but I find the whole facemask ( that what it feels like) too big and not necessary, when all we need covered is the nose.I miss my old one."
3,Does the Job!,The product came in a lot sooner than I had expected especially during the holiday season. It came in nicely packaged. I bought this for my teenage daughter. She loves it! She hasn't found anything wrong with the product. The facial scrubber bristles are very soft. I would recommend this product for anyone.
4,It's getting hot in here!,"Well I have to say that it is a steamer and it is supposed to give off heat, but it gets really hot if you don't move your face around. I think the design of it can be improved to give off an even amount of steam everywhere. I found that the chin/mouth area got extremely hot for a few seconds and when it became unbearable I moved my face. It does do its job for sure which is to open your pores. My face certainly felt softer after using. I didn't use distilled water either, I used filtered water. Easy to use, and easy to put together so it was a good investment for that reason."
5,Great Product Great Price,The facial steamer delivers amazing results. My face glows every time I use it. I would recommend it to those who want an affordable facial steamer.
2,Same as boiling water over the stove-,I was excited to purchase this product because it was so inexspensive! I recieved it and was disappointed because you have to have your face in it with a towel over your head and it gets old. You can boil water and have the same effect.
5,Love LOve LOVE it!!!,"The first try was absolutly amazing! After your done, you can feel your face breathing its awesome! There is no doubt in my mind that its worth the price plus more! if your hesitating on getting this DONT! you will miss out. All I do is turn on some music and sink my face in for about 10+ mins. GET IT GET IT!"
3,Item functionality is FAIR...But I don't think I'd pay much more than I did for it...$20 new at Walmart,"For what I paid for this item, it is alright. The main issue I have with it, is it doesn't put out NEARLY enough steam and FORCE with the steam for my liking. So, the BEST way to get the most out of this product, is to throw a LARGE towel OVER your head and AROUND the unit as to create a steam TENT, and get your face as CLOSE the the base of the unit as possible without BURNING your nostrils ;) When doing this, the item does achieve what I want, although they should make the front part of the large cone a little taller and the edge more comfortable so you can TRULY rest your face on the rim, without searing your nose :)"
5,Home medication with safety,"We bought Conair MDF2R Facial Sauna with Timer on 10/3/2010 for $22.00. My wife always has a very stuffy nose with the onset of cold, and more so during the fall. She takes a boiling jug of water and put some Vicks VaporRub into it and cover head and jug with a towel. This method works but the problem is the water cools off very soon and the vapor stops; basically your effort of 10 minutes is gone within 5 min and wastes a lot of Vicks. Then the other day I heard one of my colleague's wife had a burn by spilled boiling hot water while exercising the same. I browsed many and then finalized this one based on price, look etc. After started using, we realized that it worth every penny. It takes just a little water and it vaporizes all the Vicks, so you don't waste the Vicks too. I have recommended this to many of my friends. We don't have use for the scrubber or the facial rotating head thing, but probably others have."
5,Great tool for health as well as beauty,"I ordered this because of the secondary cone which directs the steam more to the nose area than the entire face. Due to a medical condition I cannot use decongestants, so I needed something to duplicate the congestion-busting effects of a hot shower (nothing against showers, but let's face it: Taking a shower six or seven times a day in order to clear a stuffy head is just NOT practical, not to mention the wasted water!) and this facial sauna with the smaller alternative cone fits the bill perfectly. It produces steam almost instantly, is 100% effective, and it easy to store when not in use. I realize it can't be marketed as a health or medical aid but it sure does the job in that department!"
4,Good,"It does take time to warm up. I get the machine going as I start to clean up after dinner. In about 8-10 minutes the machine is going gung-ho. I thought it was a small amount of water in the reservoir, but I got tired of the steam :-) while there was a lot of it left!! I think it will work very well with all the clogged noses we will have in winter. The timer does not seem to work. So I set up the microwave timer to go off at 10 minutes.I am using Deep Scrub on the face. It is much more softer to use the given brush than using my fingers to rub it in!! All in all money well spent."
1,Poor quality product,This facial sauna emits less steam than a hot cup of coffee. I was sorely disappointed. Had previously owned the Kaz steamer and that worked great!
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money. Put towel over you head and a big bowl of hot water is lot more effective than this. It holds up very little water so dry up quickly. Steam is kinda weak.
1,Facial steamer,For the amount of steam that comes out of that thing i reather stay a little lomger in the shower. Not worth my time. Returned as easy as usual with amazon.
1,Very bad performance!,"This facial steamer is totally a piece of junk. I thought it's a good idea to make a facial massage with this steamer, but there's no enough steam produce, and you should be very close to it to feel some warm and steam! And the massager is horrible also, after one time use, the brush rigid and the pad became unusable. This machine is totally cheaply made, not even worth to use. The manufacturer really needs to improve their technology."
4,good enought,"I use this for first time,. and is pretty good, However, if you use this for first time, you have to be very patient because it looks the acne nerver end out of your face, this happen only the first time after that it is much easier the frequenly of using this machine depends of your sking in my case i only use it oneevery month."
3,Question - not comment,"Does anyone know if the plastics on this unit are nontoxic? Putting one's face in a steam bath enveloped in plastic seems illogical to me, esp. understanding that plastics cause a good part of our health problems today.NOTE: I'm rating it mid-range due to this being a question posed for information gathering, and it not being a comment (per se), concerning the product."
3,Does the job,This facial Sauna works fine..the only thing i have noticed is that..you cannot expect the steam to come immediately after it is plugged in(and when the lights stops blinking)..you have to wait for a while..so typically i would leave it on for around 5-8 minutes or so..then put a towel over my head and steam my face.
5,Should've gotten it a long time ago,"I decided to purchase the face steamer, so I could do my facials at home. I do not regret this decision as the steamer is perfect for opening the pores and cleaning the skin. It comes with an exfoliating brush, which is very helpful as well. You can't beat this price for a home spa treatment. If you spend just a little time to clean and exfoliate your skin it will pay off in the long run"
4,Nice facial machine,"I Was looking for something like this, its really nice and relaxing.... And fast shipped... With some extras for facial caer."
3,face steamer,"steamer is ok. I think you can get the same results with hot water running in a sink, lowering your head with a towel over your head....oh well."
3,Produces too little amount of steam,"I have many scars on my face due to pimples, i wanted to use this before the derma roller. I literally had to put my face in the cylinder to have steam evenly on my face"
2,Face scrubber stopped working,"The sauna works fine with distilled water, its open enough to not suffocate you with steam but you can put a towel on if your looking to get deep into the pores. The facial scrubber cleaned out my blackheads. But only after a month it stopped working, its not meant to get wet at all, even the humidity of the bathroom will ruin it."
1,Bait and switch?,"The Conair product photographed and labeled ""Conair Facial Sauna Systems with Timer"" is model number MDF2R, which is what I intended to and thought I had purchased. What I received instead was model number FM3C. This difference is critical. The handheld microdermabrasion unit I received (model FM3C) mounts attachments about a quarter of an inch away from the base; it feels wobbly when applied to my skin. The MDF2R microdermabrasion unit appears to be longer, which would be a better fit for my hand and presumably easier to control. The MDF2R attachments in the photograph appear to be mounted in a flush fashion and probably spin with more stability. I'm thoroughly disappointed with the FM3C. I would not recommend this product."
3,Cannot rest your head,"You cannot rest your head on the cone, because it is too wide. So you have to just lean over the cone. If you forced to lay your face on the cone, you'd probably end up burning your chin and not steaming you forehead.Also,I think the steam can cause permanent damage to some types of skin by bursting capillaries. I would not use the product longer than ten minutes.I gave it three stars because it is still more convenient and faster than boiling water in a pot."
5,GOOD DEAL - NICE PRODUCT,WHO WOULD NOT WANT ONE OF THESEWORKS PERFECTLY AND FASTNICE AND SMALLGREAT DEAL - NICE SHIPPING
2,Facial cup is not big enough,"Now, I really don't think I have a huge face...but I think Conair might. The result of using this facial sauna was my face being un-evenly steamed - well on my nose, between my eyes, and on my cheeks (closest to my nose), but crap everywhere else. Much like another user pointed out, you have to tilt your head different directions to steam other parts of your face. No fun when you are trying to relax. And while you are tilting, the pores are closing on the parts of your face that are turned away from the steam. Pretty useless.I also tried Revlon's Facial Sauna, and found the same thing. Does anyone know of a good facial sauna that has a face piece that allows your whole face to get steam??!Thanks!"
3,Conair Facial Sauna Systems with Timer,Many years ago I owned a facial sauna and I really loved its benefits.Unfortunately this sauna is not as tall or as heavy and it is hard to find a place where it can be utilized without squatting or fearing it will tip over. Even though this is advertised as 'wide' my face just fits inside.I wish I had heeded the reviewer who panned this product earlier. This is probably going to end up in the give-away pile and I will put a towel over a steaming pot to accomplish the same thing.
2,Piece of Junk,"I am not happy with these products. The steamer doesn't create enough steam for a facial, even with holding a towel over my head. I can hear & see the water bubbling and can't help but wonder if it's going to bubble boiling water onto my face. The facial scrubber it comes with is a peice of crap as well. Looks like it was made in the 1980's, and made cheaply as well. Very disappointed. Will return."
3,Not something I've used a lot of.,I bought this back in 2009 and I just used it for the 3rd time the other day. It's not a bad product but it's not really a useful product either. The amount of steam is not that great and I hate to say it but I think it's easier just to use a pan with a towel. The face brush it came with was awesome and totally worth the price of the product but it didn't last very long. I dropped it in the shower too many times and from the water getting in the battery compartment it just stopped working. I just spent $30 on the olay face brush and it's almost the same but I did like the conair one better.
4,IT DOES THE JOB!,"Well if youre looking for a simple and easy way to steam your face, this product is great! I put a towel over my head for even more intense steam. It does the job well! My face feels refreshed afterwards."
4,Conair MDF2R Facial Sauna with Timer,"I was looking for a facial sauna for home use,for my wife, who had just returned from six months of duty in Iraq, but she had never used a product like this before. After following the directions, it worked like a charm. With 110V, it takes several minutes to heat up. You cannot be in a hurry with this product. The battery operated brush exfoliator was a pleasant surprise.She keeps the brush apparatus and the smaller components in the clear plastic container, positioned to the left of the facial sauna. She also used a plastic bag to cover the facial sauna. It is too time consuming to screw on and off the large top clear plastic portion of the facial sauna when not in use. All in all, it did the job of cleansing her facial pores in a grand manner."
4,Great Item,"I bought this item for my sister, who has terrible sinusitis. She is using it to inhale essential oils through steam. Note that this practice actually goes against manufacturer specs. The manufacturer actually warns against placing anything but tap water into the heating receptacle. So far, so good. My sister is experiencing some relief. At the low price we paid, if the unit fails because we are placing a few drops of essential oils into the heating receptacle along with the water, we'll just purchase another one. Great item for the money, and fast delivery, well-packaged and arrived in perfect condition."
3,Good,Steam is not hot enough. Price is reasonable. I've been using it for over 2 years and still working. Will get a better one with hotter steam next time.
1,Garbage,"Does not produce one bit of steam. Followed instructions exactly and nothing happened, the water got warm, but nothing else. No steam. Tried it again a few days later, same result. Returning promptly! Don't waste your time or money!"
1,instantly broke with a flame when i turned it on,"this is no good. i plugged this in, turned on the power and the inside of it popped and fizzed, flamed up and there was smoke for 3 seconds. it was then broken. i had already thrown the packaging out since i trusted this product was going to work, so i can't return it. don't buy this. it's also made of cheap plastic. It's really not that nice. plus a bit dangerous in my opinion. I'm going to stick with a pot of boiling water and towel to steam my face."
2,Uncomfortable,"This product does what it says, but it is so uncomfortable to use that its not worth it. The plastic cone is an awkward size for most people, and it hurts my neck after 5 minutes of resting my face in it. I do like the electric face brush, its great for exfoliating."
3,conair,"good enough for the money paid; but by far not producing as much steam as expected. as well, not a good face fit, and feels like too hot temperature, but can play around it with a towel over the head and just hovering above it."
2,Not enough steam!!!!,Just bought this item. DOnt like it at all. Not enough steam by any stretch of the imagination. I give it a 2 star because the exfoliating brush and other amenities are great added features.
2,Elisa NYC,"It doesn't give as much steam as I would have hoped for, a pot of hot water and a towel as a tent definetly more effective"
4,Great buy!,"Very relaxing way to spend a couple of minutes. Bought it for acne control can't tell if its working. At the very least its relaxing and clears up stuffy noses, just got sick recently. It does get VERY HOT though, enough to make breathing a bit painful, I found having my mouth half in and half out while I breathed through my mouth helped."
2,not bad,"I am used to steaming my face the old fashion way, boil some water, cover with a towel and steam as needed.I bought this because for few months I could not use the stove top.Let's just say the good old fashioned method is definitely better.Not enough steam and does not steam the entire face especially the upper neck and just below the jaw line.Too soon to tell if the scrubber is helping my face."
2,It started leaking,"I bought this in 2007, used it less than 5 times, and just had to throw it away due to leaking. The steam was sufficient, especially for the price, but the workmanship must suck and I can't recommend it to anyone."
3,use a pot of boiling water,"Overall, the product is not what is expect. First, the product is smaller than what I expected. Only the front of your face gets pampered, you have to manuever your face to get the sides steamed. Second, the amount of steam coming for the unit is like a cup of hot coffee. Finally, the product is a big rip off, if the manufactor wanted someone to enjoy it they would have made a product that is productive. Don't waste your money, put a pot of water on the stove and use it."
1,Use a pot....,"this product was bought for some sauna action and i found that using a pot with a towel is just as good, if not better, i used this product once."
3,where is the timer...,"I think it is OK, but I don't know why the timer doesn't work and I don't know how long I have been steamed... Until the water stopped boiling ( I can hear from the water) and I finally saw the water is all dry... Don't have something to stop it automatically when it is dry...anyway I think it's OK because it steamed face quick good."
2,smooshy,"These olives are a bit past their prime. No firmness at all, they just slide off of the pit. I don't really enjoy squishy olives so I guess that I'll have to use them in tampanade or something."
5,The Best Nancy Compilation.,The best Nancy Sinatra/Lee Hazelwood songs are on this CD. The way the two voices play one to another reminds me of some of the old Ella Fitzgerald/Louis Armstrong 78s. Great stuff!
3,Excellent performer,"This record encompasses some of the greatest hits recorded in the past by Nancy Sinatra alone (These Boots Are Made for Walking) or in duo with Lee Hazlewood (Summerwine - which is superb -), her father or Dean Martin (only one song with each) and many other songs which are not outstanding. Thus, no surprises, but a very good general impression. The price is too high!"
2,Nancy Sinatra is the queen of mediocrity,"You can't help but love her. Nancy Sinatra has the voice of a rather contrived singer wannabe. Lee Hazelwood should get an award for writing and presenting Miss Sinatra with any credibility at all. Her sixties pop outing here is part of that era, but she has hardly survived as an entertainer with validity since losing Lee Hazelwood as her partner and mentor. Enjoy this for its' pop culture appeal, and save yourself from any further investments."" SugarTown and Boots"" are signature Nancy."
2,I miss the cassette,The updated version with the CD in place of the DVD looses half the sound. The spelling test (which I frequently used as a demo for teachers) doesn't work. I'm very disappointed.
4,Baroque Music in China:,"A very original idea, with some charming music by minor but very competent composers, sometimes very inventive."
4,Firefox looks and sounds great,"I haven't watched the Heartbreak Ridge disc yet but Firefox has never looked or sounded better. It's not reference quality by any stretch but it is a significant improvement over the DVD in every respect. Firefox is a great movie, btw."
5,High recomnendation for Vocal Jazz fans,Excellent album somewhat reminescent of Hi-Lo's with some Lambert Hendricks and Ross. Outstanding arrangements and performances! Highly recommend this one... you won't be disappointed! Nice job!
3,Good Final Destination But Hard to Reach There,"Book has excellent final points and analysis of system design, but it is exceedingly a challenge to follow the tortured writing style (too many details and hard-to-follow examples). I wish someone would make a Reader's Digest version and then it would be a great book! By the way, descriptions of accidents in this book transpired exactly in recent tragic events in Japan."
3,The author had an accident,"While this book is thoughtful and well written, it fails to live up to its title: MANAGING the Risks of Organizational Accidents. It talks about accidents (I like failure better), it describes the various ways they occur, and it gives many examples. But nowhere does the author distill his insights and theories into a management strategy for preventing failures and/or managing or containing them once the genie is out of the bottle. I consider that a failure on his part, because he is an indisputable expert in this field of study. So, if you want to know ABOUT organizational failures and breakdowns (as opposed to individual failures), this book is worth reading. If you want to know what the organization's management team should do after knowing ABOUT all the ways their company can fail, don't expect to find it in this book. I read it twice and read some chapters three times. It isn't there."
5,Organizational Accidentes,"A great concept for preventing accidents in complex systems. It shows how to manage operations presentign high risks, I recommend."
5,Wow-My faith is flying!,"This book really helped me realize the difference between having faith and ""making a wish"". I'd recommend this to anyone looking to move up to the next level in spiritual confidence."
3,More Than Blowing Hot Air,"This brief (77 page) book is on the career of a Frenchmen who gained control of his [...] sphincter so that he could mimic musical pieces and ""speak""in a variety of voices. The writing style is somewhat inert though the subject matter is truly unique. The book's subject accidentally discovered his talent and developed it into stage acts appearing at the Moulin Rouge, for example. ...A story of someone who worked his way up from the bottom."
3,Bad description,"Item arrived as scheduled. HOWEVER it is not as stated. The unit has a 1/8' input not a 1/4' input. Someone owes me a 1/8"" to 1/4"" adapter. The written specs say 1/4"" input but the tabulated specs, the schematic and the unit are 1/8""."
1,Poorly manufactured!!,After using it for a short while the unit started to get intermittent. So I opened the box. What did I find? All of the leads on the PC board had not been cut and some were shorting to the case. I guess Rolls want their customers to do the QA. Well that is the last Rolls product I shall own. It looks like they do not really do any QA.
4,Eagles Magnet,"I was happy with my order. It arrived when it was soppose to and in the condition I was told it would be in.Thank you,Christy"
3,Decent quality,"My son likes his new robe, but I have to say that the price is a bit too high for what it is. I prefer the thinner fabrics, and this fabric is thin without being too thin. It's fine, nothing wrong with it, but it should be priced around $30 to be worth what it is."
3,Cinnamon Sugar pillar candle,"A lovely scent prior to removing plastic from candle and after. While an attractive color, the scent was to light while burning."
3,average and a bit rushed.,"This is a so-so album. Only 3 songs grasped my attention. Scorch The Ground, Castaway, & October Song. Other songs on this CD are pretty dull and have the same ""feel"" as most up to date EBM artists. This album highly lacks that true seabound ""feel"" that I've grown used to from previous CD's. The composure of Double-Crosser feels a bit rushed. EBM kid - buyer beware."
3,Moving backwards with better equipment.,I wasn't impressed by this new album. Beyond Flatline was great but this album just sounds like it was thrown together at the last minute. It seems like they've also added some expirimental sounds to the album which just throws the whole thing off.
5,A good buy!,These iKlear wipes work really well on all electronic items (even if they are not Apple products). I have used the wipes on my ipod and on my laptop computer. They clean grease and other spots without leaving any smear marks or harming the function of your electronics. I would recommend buy this item for any computer or ipod owner.
1,Excited till I tried it,"I thought these wipes would be safe and handy for my Macbook Pro, but they left an annoying film that was hard to remove!"
1,Klear screen is horrible,"Klear screen has to be the absolute worst product I've ever used. It has nearly ruined my 2001fp. I was stupid and used it on my primary display first, instead of using the 50/50 isopropyl alcohol/water mix that's far superior to klear screen products. My LCD now has cloudy areas and streaks that simply will not come out. My 3 year old laptop's display looks nearly perfect because I only used the 50/50 solution on it, my 2001fp looks horrible now."
3,Immature Release-Leaves You Unsatisfied,"I must say, upon first listen, I thought I loved this CD. Upon listening to it a few more times, I grew to see the multiple flaws. First of all, many of the songs use very similar harmonies and guitar riffs, second of all, many songs sound slightly like circus music, ""Gremmy"" anyone?Overall, this isn't the worst CD you can buy, but I would definately buy Toby Mac or something instead."
4,One of Milsap's best,"A treasure trove of the best of early 80s contemporary country sound. Only the oddly out of place 'I Love New Orleans Music' keeps this from 5 stars. Interestingly, some of the best cuts weren't released as singles...Carolina Dreams, Wrong End of the Rainbow, Who's Counting, You Took Her Off My Hands."
3,good quallity map but not all of Atlanta,"the map is good quality and will fit in a glove box, but to my dismay, where my son lives is in Atlanta, but is off the map! So, very good if you want central Atlanta, but not so good if you are a little northeast, he lives just east of buckhead and it is not covered in that area. As I do not know the area myself, I can't speak to other sections of the city."
4,"P.E. brings FUNK, ROCK, and most of all, HIP-HOP!!!!!!!!!","From the opening scratch-wails of ""Whole Lotta Love Goin On..."" to the blazing thrash guitar of ""Hitler Day"", this album packs a mega-dose whallop of hip-hop fury. This time around, Chuck D and the Bomb Squad crew bring more LIVE INSTRUMENTS into the mix: Guitars, Bass, Drums & Keyboards- Darned near an alternative record. As Chuck D himself may have put it, ""If it's alternative to wack, then it's just that.."" INCREDIBLE!! Chuck takes everyone to task on this record, challenging both the United Snakes of Amerikkka, and the hip-hop audience themselves.Best cuts: ""Give It Up"", ""What'cha Gone Do?"", ""Live & Undrugged"", ""Hitler Day"", ""Godd Complexx"".This album was slept on during its first release. Don't make this mistake again!"
2,Unfocused,"The opener and ""Give It Up"" are terrific, and some other songs (Whatcha Gone Do Now?) are worth a listen, but this album is all over the place conceptually and musically, burdened down with the irritability and poor beats that hurt ""Apocalypse."""
1,garbage,This album is terrible.The early pe albums were pretty good but this album completely sucks.Cool album cover but that is about it.Crappy raps and even worse beats.Stay away.
5,PURE FLAVA,WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? TOP CD. I HAVE THIS DISC AND ITS AS GREAT AS YO! BUM RUSH THE SHOW. THIS CD MAKES ME QUESTIAN THE POWERS THAT BE. BEING THAT IM MIXED WITH SO MANY RACES- IM NOW PROUD TO SAY IM BLACK. ARE YOU?
3,Mediocre,"What a decline in such a short time from their first few classic CDs to this! Chuck D was (and is) a great artist, but this is just an uninspired mess. I'm still hoping for the great Public Enemy comeback (""He Got Game"" notwithstanding)."
2,no,"Get their first four albums first. This album and all of the stuff they've made since just dont have the same vibe, anger and great ryhmes that make the enemy so great."
3,msavage,"This game would have been much better if you were able to play freely against the computer. Unfortunately, you end up as a lieutenant for the godfather and he gives you tasks to carry out. You are only able to move forward in the game once you have completed the tasks.Worth the money but could have been a lot better."
3,"Great game, not enough of it","This reminds me of Jurassic Park III, you have an entertaining thing and then it suddenly ends without any sort of closure. I sat with my mouth open wide when the game ended. Why? Why did it have to end? Why aren't there expansion packs? WHY?!!?! *sniff* Oh well, back to Legos..."
3,"I wanted to be an emperor of the underworld, but....","Though I would like to play it freely--to attack enemies whenever I wish or to expand turfs--I had to do exactly what the Godfather said. Throughout the scenario, I strongly wished that I could carry a coup d'etat against that man. But, after all, I should end up with one of his lieutenants because of its setting.The game itself was fun and worth playing."
2,Not worth the money or time,"Summary: the only thing Mob Rules does is rule you throughout the game. If you can imagine Ages of Empire II or Homeworld with only the campaigns and not with multiplayer vs computer, this is what you end up with.If you are a true RTS fanatic, you will be highly disappointed with this piece of work."
2,I could swear it said Pom Poms,"I ordered these pom poms (or Pom as the case turned out to be)for my three year old daughter along with a kids cheerleading tape for Christmas. I remember thinking that $9.99 was a great price for a nice set of pom poms. The pom was great and pretty and all, but I wasted a lot of time looking for the other one. I just figured that during the hustle and bustle of the present opening we must have missplaced the other pom. I then checked my on line recipt and sure enough it said 1 pom was sent.If you look on the web sight I bet you can't tell me it's obivous your only getting one.Anyway I guess I'm just dissapointed by the whole thing.""Buyer beware."" boy they ain't kidding here.I would have rated this product a 2 1/2 if given the option. Had I got the other half it too would have also been a 2 1/2 rating alltogether giving it the higest rating avaiable."
4,Great for a woman's wrist,"Bought this for a marathon while my heart rate monitor was (inconveniently) having its battery changed. Fits a female wrist really well and yet has an easily readable face. Have only had it a couple of weeks so can't speak to its reliability, but currently working well!"
4,great sports watch,"I am very pleased with this watch. Very simple to use. I have actually replaced my alarm clock with this watch since the wake up sound is very soft and pleasant and it has flexible programming for the three alarms. I have a tiny wrist, wish they make watches with more flexible band. I use it a lot for lap timing"
1,Flimsier That It Looks,"I've owned 3 Ironman watches for about a year each (I'm not a quick learner!). Although all 3 were treated well (few scratches on any of them), the posts that connect the strap to the timepiece broke on each one after a year's use. The Ironman seems well constructed but if it is used for any sports (hiking and kayaking in my case), it doesn't last long. The watch won't stay ""in"" the strap with a broken post. I'm a very disappointed customer and do not recommend buying a Timex Ironman."
2,Decent but started leaking in 4 Months,"Seems like a good watch. All the right features and easy to use. Two problems. First was moisture under the glass after a swim merely 4 months since purchasing. The other problem is minor, but the gloss on the purple finish is starting to chip away and make it look a little rough around the edges. It does have a warranty, but you have to pay for shipping there and include $7 for return shipping."
1,Nice at first....,"I have owned 2 of these watches... I bought the second one hoping that the first one I owned was just a dud. This watch is great at first. I love the colors and the sleek design of it. However, after a few months of wear, the band pulls away from the actual watch part. The second one I purchased did the same thing. I even tried super gluing it back together. I was so dissapointed because I really really wanted to love this watch :( Unfortunately, don't waste your money on this watch until they change the design."
2,Nice watch while the strap lasts,"Like many reviews have mentioned - the strap peels off from the watch after a few months of wearing it. I bought this as a gift for my mom and she really liked the design, look, and function. She doesn't swim but maybe just showers with the watch on. Less than a year later, she showed me that the strap is coming off. I tried contacting Timex about this but got no response. In regular use of her active lifestyle the watch didn't last long. It's too bad because all other designs of sporty Timex watches that I've had before are much more durable.So yes, it's a nice watch, but don't expect it to last. With that, I don't think it's worth the money, even the sale price."
3,Difficult to change battery,"This is my third ironman watch. When the battery goes dead, it is very difficult to get the little screws out to change battery. Then it is no longer water resistance. I think the really don't want to make it easy to change the battery; they just want you to buy a we watch."
4,Acceptable for the price,I had this watch for less than a year because the band peeled away from the watch around the buttons. I did like the features of the watch itself and was happy with how it performed up until the above mentioned issue.
2,Broken Light,"I have had this watch for only 3 months and it is already broken. I went to use the light function the other night and it doesn't work anymore. I saw the light flicker then die like a regular light bulb so now I can't see the time at night anymore. I am super frustrated because I loved the watch, but had expected it to last longer."
1,Fell apart,"I received this watch as a gift. Within less than a year, the buttons fell off the watch, and then the watch band adhesive loosened and the band fell off as well. It appears that this kind of rubbery watch band is not designed to last. I contacted the Timex company, but since it was outside of the one year warranty, they refused to replace it."
2,Badly designed band,"The watch is only two months old and the band has already detached from the watch. Unfortunately this is not a repairable issue, and the watch is now not useable. Great watch other than that..but....."
4,Timex Women's Ironman Sleek Resin Strap Watch,"I ordered this watch to replace a Nike watch that is no longer being made. I've been wearing it for a few weeks and it feels and looks good. Along with that, it had other features I wanted: time, day and date (all easy to read), Indiglo, and water resistance, but other than general hand or dish washing, I haven't had occasion to check the water resistance and may not, just in case it isn't (that's what killed my supposedly water resistant Nike watch). I found the date and time easy to set, but the instructions for setting the 2nd time zone--the one other feature I really wanted--were not detailed enough. Either that, or I am not smart enough to follow them. I have not been able to set the 2nd time zone, so that's a bit of a disappointment."
2,Toast after a swim,"I bought this after having several Ironman watches with the expectation that it would be a solid watch for a few years to come. After the second time taking it to the swimming pool the watch leaked and stopped working. It looks like others have had similar problems. Not sure if it is the design of this particular model that is the problem or not. I will admit that for the price you don't expect miracles but if something is labeled Ironman you expect that you can take it swimming, running and biking without a second thought."
3,"Good watch, but may leak","I bought this watch for my 12-year-old daughter about a year ago. It's been a good watch for her and she loves it. The lavender surround on the face has started peeling a bit, but it is barely noticable. Considering that my daughter wears this all day every day, I can't complain about the durability. One issue of concern was when my daughter wore the watch while swimming. She has done this on several occasions, but this time, some water leaked into the casing. This caused the inside of the ""crystal"" to fog up, water droplets to appear inside, and the display began to fade - as if the battery were weak. I opened the watch and dried off all visible moisture then let it sit open for a day. After reassembly, it worked fine. It hasn't been back in the pool yet, so we don't know if the leaking will be an ongoing problem."
4,"Great, but don't expect it to last forever","I've had this watch for just under 18 months now and have been loving it. I haven't done as much outdoor activity with it as I would have liked, but mainly used the multiple timers and interval timers for reminders (for when I had my first child). I also LOVED the Indiglo night feature, but am saddened and a bit disappointed that that feature has now died completely and the warranty for the watch is only a year long. So the watch still works, but I can't use/see it at night or in any dim place (which is when I probably use it most). I'm hoping the repair cost will be cheaper (even with the shipping/handling fee) than buying a new one as I do really like this watch."
4,Not so waterproof,"This is a nice watch, attractive, and my teenage daughter likes it alot. I got it for the alarms feature and waterproof feature. The alarms are ok, but you cannot set different sounds for different times, but very doable. The waterproofness? Not so much, there are bubbles in there after a few swims, so she takes it off now for swimming and bathing."
4,Timex watch t5E511,"Tiene excelentes funciones, graba la memoria del cronometro, y puede separarse el tiempo en vueltas, el modo nocturno es muy util, lo recomiendo para corredores. Un detalle mi correa se despego y se me perdio el reloj, creo q era porq me lo mojaba de resto excelente!!!"
3,"GREAT FUNCTIONS, POOR DURABILITY","I've had two ironman watches--the wristband on the first one broke & is non replaceable, the second one got water inside the crystal while I was gardening after 9 months of wear. It still keeps time and all the functions (alarm, stopwatch, etc) still work, but you can only see the top half of the display. I was hoping it would dry out but no such luck. As stated before you have to pay to have it shipped to Timex & then pay $7 for return shipping if you want to use the warranty, so it does seem as if Timex has a racket going to make a few extra dollars. It will be easier for me to just buy a new watch. I love the functions, especially the two time zone function as we travel a lot, so it is very disappointing that the durability is so poor."
2,Women's triathlon Sleek 50/100 Watch review,"I'm afraid I find this watch far too complicated. I wanted to be able to recall more intervals than my previous watch handled, but don't care about storage of multiple workouts, and now when I finish the workout I have a hard time recalling the splits. If I mistakenly press ""Start"" too early, I have no idea how to reset it quickly and start it again, so the whole workout is a complete blank. At first I thought being able to set more than one interval timer was a great idea, but it took so long (and would be impossible to do in the dark, as is pretty much everything else) that I am committed to 3 mins., 1 min. intervals and would never be able to change it at my speedwork class when presented with a different workout! Very disappointing."
3,Ok but plastic band eventually breaks,"Bought for my wife who used it nearly everyday for about 1.5 years until band cracked and broke. She liked it enough, though not sure if she used all the features. When plastic band broke it could not be replaced or repaired. To me that's a problem when the band breaks and can't be replaced, so much sooner than than watchpiece itself breaks. I suppose that may impact the aesthetic style of the watch, but the replacment I'm I'm looking for will have traditional cloth or leather band. 3 stars for everyday use for 1.5 years. To me the band should at least last 3-5 years ..."
1,Not a Heart Rate Monitor Watch,"I typed in ""Heart Rate Monitor Watches for Women"". This popped up and looked cute and had high ratings. My fault for not researching more before I ordered I guess. But after getting it and trying to use it, I realized there is no HRM function. UGH, returned it."
1,Band separates from watch face,I too have now owned two of these watches and both have fallen apart in less than a year. The band comes loose from the face of the watch and its non-repairable. With the second watch I was very careful about not having it underwater much (even tho its waterproof) thinking that might increase its life but no luck.
3,Upside: 3 alarms. Downside: plastic wristband.,"I love that this watch has multiple alarms--great for snoozing. In fact, I use it to wake up every day. Unfortunately, I can't actually wear the watch any more. After wearing it for about 6 months with no problem, I developed an allergy to the plastic wristband. The skin covered by the watch turns red and itches for several days after wearing it for only a couple of hours."
2,Don't bother- Band won't last!!!,"The band on this watch separates from the watch face along the sides and is a bad design. I would have given this watch 5 stars had it not been for the fact that I have owned it less than 6 months and it just won't stay together. The band is all one piece and surrounds the outside of the watch by going up both sides and around the four side buttons. The band stretches a little over time and then won't hold. I wear a watch like this all the time, so I may wear it more than some of you might, but I am going to try and find another watch now as Timex doesn't warranty their poor band design. I gave it 2 stars because the watch portion is awesome, but that doesn't do me any good if I can't wear it!"
2,Watch leaks and Indiglo doesn't work...,"I received this watch right before I was heading out of town for a several week long trip. The watch seemed great at first, but I soon found that it leaked when it got wet. This caused moisture to gather under the screen making it near impossible to read the time. Since I was on a trip, I wasn't able to return the watch at that time. As the trip continued, the Indiglo feature of the watch stop working.Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of this product as I have had many other Timex Ironman Triathlon watches and never had any problems.To make matters worse, by the time my trip ended and I returned home it was too late to return the item. So now I am stuck with a watch that leaks and doesn't light up..."
3,NOT Water Resistent,"While I understand that this doesn't say it is water-proof it does advertise that it is water-resistant. It is not. We purchased it to go to summer camp. My daughter wore this when walking in a river and put her hand down to catch herself on rocks. It got wet but wasn't submerged for any length of time. It got moisture under the crystal. We were able to ""dry it out"" in a bag of rice but I'm still disappointed that it doesn't function as advertised."
2,Didn't Last a Year,"This watch looks really nice and has most of the functions that I need, however it didn't even last a year. The strap started breaking where the push buttons were. Inside the strap are little protruding pieces of plastic that hold the strap in. One of them broke off inside the hole where it fits in, and then one by one, the others started breaking as well. Of course, once the strap breaks, it's no longer water proof. It lasted about 6 months before it started to break down, and then it took another 3 months before the whole thing fell apart. I definitely would not recommend this product. I'll give it 1 star for lasting 6 months and another for being a fashion statement."
1,"Great look, doesn't last",I have owned two of these watches. Same as others....looks great....BUT...began leaking w/in 7 months. First one had issues with color fading and peeling. Definitely more of a disposable model!
2,Watch band is awful!!!,"I've had this watch for only 4 months and the band is already falling apart. The gray strap is coming loose from the watch face in all for corners. The indiglo button stopped working about a month ago too. I love the ease of use of the watch...chrono, timer and interval timers are all very easy to set up, but the durability is awful!!"
3,Great watch but at 6 months the light broke,I really like this watch and especially the band (it doesn't hold water) but after just 6 months the Indiglo light no longer functioned. I use the light a lot and it is one of the main reasons I bought it.
3,"very simple, too simple","a very basic watch, it looks vreat but doesn't gice you any importent tools which may help your runinng. quite disapointed."
2,Good watch except not waterproof,"I purchased this water as an open water swimmer. The first time I used I the lens filled with water and timex isn't helpful when reporting a defective product. I even read the instructions and didn't push any of the buttons while underwater. Very disappointed in the watch, it might wok for some but mine was defective."
2,"Little used, never the same after new battery, now dead","I do not believe Timex understands the term ""IronMan"".My wife did have this for 5 years. She did use it about 4 months before 1 marathon a year for 5 years. One year was 2 marathons. My wife is a small petite thing.Changing the battery was a humongous pain in the butt! Had to install and take out ~5 times due to challenges with screen and such after battery inserted and tightened up. Don't believe it ever really tightened up as it should. Not used in water, shower, etc.Great size and ability for the price.Just not an IronMan type quality. Maybe 'PrettyGoodMan"" quality?Would not buy again."
1,Fine if you wan a watch for 6 months,Worked fine for the first 6 months. Then the prong that hold the watch face into the band broke. Just a cheap piece of plastic. now watch is useless.
3,"Outdoors man maybe, but no Ironman","I really like Timex Ironman watches. They have awesome features and hold up well during my outdoor adventures. I think this is my 5th or 6th Ironman watch in the last 10 years. However, as a group they seem to be lasting less and less time. After just over a year of having this watch, the rubber loop that keeps the strap down broke. I fixed the issue by making a comparable loop with duct tape, but now the rubber portion of the strap is staring to peel away from the watch-the glue is failing. Based on this experience, I'd suggest an Timex Ironman with a different type of strap."
3,"Accurate, but hard to use","I purchased this watch when I first started doing 5k road races. It is attractive and does everything it is supposed to. The only problem I had with it was that in order to start and stop the chronograph you have to push the button firmly and exactly. So far that is a challenge for me both at the start and finish lines. Found myself still trying to get it started 10 meters into the race, which sort of defeats the purpose. I am now wearing it as just a regular watch and really like it for that. Attractive, comfortable, and accurate. Timing my races with a watch I picked up at WalMart for under $10. That may not be as high-tech, but it is very easy to start and stop and gives me accurate readings."
3,Some of the Best - and the rest,"Sky are one of those groups with something for everyone. I've seen metallica fans get off on the pounding rock beat of ""Toccatta"" and orchestral enthusiasts in raptures over ""Sahara"". But this universal appeal comes at a price - few like everything the band has done. This album is truly representative of the group's achievements over their first 4 studio albums, and that is both its blessing and its flaw. The problem is that there are so many great tracks - no matter what your tastes - that were left out of this collection in favour of tracks that are not so brilliant. But, of course, for everyone who argues for the deletion of track ""A"", there will be others who insist that it's the best track on the album.... This is a satisfactory introduction to the group, but don't be fooled - whatever you like on here, there is more (and possibly better) on the source CDs. And why ""Fayre"", from their 5th studio album, ""Cadmium"", was left off, I'll never know...."
1,Poor quality,"My daughter was not at all interested. Is it poorly made. ""I"" have difficulty tying the laces and the snaps were plastic. I was very dissapointed so I returned it."
2,Follett was still learning how to write.,"This is evidently one of the first books ever written by Follett. The plot is banal, the characters are built very superficially. It's worth reading only if you are a young writer in need of encouragement - it shows a youthful, unsuccessful effort by an author who grew later on to be a really good writer.However, if you read it expecting the high quality of other books by Follett, you will be frustrated."
4,An exciting thriller,"This was the first book I had read by Ken Follett, but since I have also read the Modigliani Scandal. He keeps the reader so interested with the action, fast turns and dramatics that it is hard to put the book down when you get tired. I enjoyed this book very much and I hope to get an opportunity to read more of this talented authors' work in the future."
3,For those partial to escapism British style.,"The Big Needle by Ken Follet is a short action-adventure novel which aspires to nothing loftier than providing escapist fare. In that regard, it has a lot in common with the earlier work of Jack Higgins.The protagonist and first person narrator is a rich, swinging Londoner answering to the name ""Apples"" Carstairs who decides to exact revenge on the drug kingpin he holds responsible for getting his teenage daughter hooked on heroin. There's plenty of fast paced action as Carstairs goes about carrying out his rather unlikely plan.By and large, the characters are poorly fleshed out and the plot is more than somewhat implausible. No one is likely to mistake The Big Needle for great literature but it is entertaining in a superficial, guilty pleasure sort of way. A three star effort. No more, no less."
5,Best circular saw ever made.,"This is the most overlooked saw in the world. The most powerful you would have to try it. I have used skils, milwaukees, they are weak. Try this saw. Electric brake is handy especially if blade guard gets pinned back. ( accidentally of course... wink,wink) Some guys fear the power I understand it has a torque twist and is not good for guys with weak wrists."
4,Rip Fence Problem,"The saw is great, but doesn't come with a rip fence or thumbscrew to secure the rip fence to the saw. DON'T order the rip fence recommended for it because it's not the proper fit, and as far as I know, Makita doesn't make a proper rip fence for this saw.The best I could do was to use a Skil adjustable rip fence #13896, and order the thumbscrew from Makita, because the thumbscrew that comes with the Skil rip fence doesn't fit the Makita saw."
4,No Brake,"I do not have this saw but there is no brake as a previous reviewer said;the warning in the man. says ""blade coasts to a stop."" Look at the Makita web site manual .pdf.I will pass as I want a brake. I have a Bosch WD and PC without it,good saws but I like to have a blade brake now. Got used to it on my Milwaulkee 18v cordless.Note: This is the new model,better shoe,rubberpad on handle,15A not 14A, as before on ""5277N""."
4,Plenty of power in a Hand saw,"This Makita product is a powerful well designed hand saw. Much to my dismay, it is made in China! This wormdrive saw is solid and heavy , perhaps too heavy. The blade that it comes with cuts fine but isn't one of the sharpest or best quality. For the price this saw is a great value and perfect for home use but I would not recommend it for a contractor, builder or other proffessional that would use it on a daily basis due to it's weight."
5,Great Debut Album,"I am so impressed with Kristy Starling's debut album. She has an incredibly fluid, beautiful voice and her music complements her voice so well. With her music on the Friends promos I wouldn't be surprised if she breaks out in a big way!"
4,Excellent debut for new artist,"I cannot stop listening to this album. After hearing Kristy on the Today Show, I was blown away and picked up her album. I am very impressed by her beautiful voice and meaningful lyrics."
4,Great new artist!,"She has such a wonderful and refreshing pop voice! Her single ""Water"" is so beautiful. You should all check out this album!"
3,the STAR of tomorrow discovered TODAY,"Kristy has a powerful voice, and showcases her talent in her songs. Her first single ""Water"" is already making waves on Christian radio; however, the album lacks a certain ""something"" that makes it unique and a hit on the charts.There are a few uptempo songs that I enjoy listening to, such as ""All For You"". The album also includes several cover songs, for example, ""I Need You"", which was originally recorded by country singer LeAnn Rimes. Her voice in that particular song falls short of LeAnn's, but it is still a good version nonetheless.Kristy is a breath of fresh-air in Contemporary Christian music. Hopefully by her second or third album, Kristy will have a chance to grow musically and start writing her own songs."
3,More Fizzle than Sizzle,"Author seemed to have relied too heavily on detailing things that I found extremely distracting from the story. I just don't find it necessary to know every minute detail unless it has some bearing on what is happening; it tends to make me feel as though the author is just filling space. I enjoyed both characters (Emily and Val) seperately but didn't really get a sense of them together; they sort of fizzled instead of sizzled. The author spent so much time in describing things around them that she sort of left the main characters to develop on their own and as best they could. Although all the characters were quite colorful and indeed enjoyable, ""Waltz With A Vampire"" had all the elements to be a thoroughly funny romance novel but just missed the mark. A shame indeed."
2,Not What I Expected,"I should have known by the title that this would be an historical novel, which is not my favorite type. But my main comlaint is with the vampire and the heroine who I did not like or enjoy reading about. He was too cavalier, distant, uptight and she was too annoying with her prudish, bookish, rather stilted attitude. I also disliked the tedious descriptions that went on and on. I really had trouble finishing this book, because none of the characters rang true or even fantastic, either would have worked for me. By the style of the cover you might think this book is humorous, but alas that angle doesn't work either. Some might find the characters funny, but I just found them ridiculous. Any humor was tasteless and at the expense of the characters. I could have cared less if Emily and Val got together. They seemed so disconnected and distant and their passions so weak and dimwitted, no pun intended."
1,Fashonistas deluded down on the family farm,"Perfect for hanging out at Starbucks, acting condescending towards the poor working stiffs down on the farm, and the best part, you don't have to get your hands dirty! As an organic farmer for some 30 years, these people are clueless."
1,disappointing,"If you are looking for funny, keep looking!! I was expecting some humorous stories that I could identify with as a hairdresser. These weren't stories, they were one-liners all starting with ""customer"" did this or said that. I also read the entire book in less than 5 minutes. More like a pamphlet. It was full of spelling and grammar errors, starting with one on the front cover. That's 10 bucks I'll never see again."
5,Blown away,"These are Bartok's ""edgiest"" works. As such, they belong to the period of his music that mid-century radicals like Boulez think is his ""best"". I am not sure this is correct, because I think that some of his late, somewhat less spiky pieces are masterpieces too. It's all Jelly Roll style, as the man said. But these 2 sonatas are amazing, that's for sure. And this performance rocks! Why did I ever have issues with Gidon Kremer? Youthful jealousy, I guess. He was trying so hard to be a Pop star - Kronos syndrome, avant la lettre...But he can back it all up. Viva la difference! What, you want musical analysis? On Amazon? Just buy the CD and get a good book about Bartok."
3,couple of disappointments,"Overall satisfied but rather disappointed by the fact that though your ad clearly said ""ship free"" when I clicked the 'fast lane' tab to order the s/handling was added& I did not catch this little detail. Is this fair, Mr. Amazon?The other disappointment was the actual size of the font vis a vis the size of the watch. Way TOO BIG."
5,Greatest watch for active people,This is a great watch for active people as it has all the functions you look for. I have tried other watches and keep coming back to this one.
2,The FLIX flunks,"My Timex FLIX froze up yesterday. It was a great watch for the last 6 weeks. Three weeks after the expiration of the return policy, this watch has frozen up on the chronograph view. I will try a new battery. If that works then I maintain it is a good watch. It not then I got ripped off. I have worn Iron Man watches for most of my life. The is the first one that I didn't beat into submission. It apparently croaked on its own. If it is the battery then why did that battery have such a short life? It was only $40 so I will just look for another running watch."
2,"Great Watch, Lousy Band!","I really enjoy this watch. I use it to time my work-outs, and running.I've only used it briefly, and when I picked it up, one side of the band just fell off!It's a tight fit to get it back on, and the watch case appears to be some plastic material. Can't get the pin holding the band back in, and I just keep scratching the case.Ended up buying a nylon strap band for $8, and that works fine. This is kind of a ""classy"" Sport watch and the new band doesn't look too good.I do like the watch."
2,Don't get it wet,I've had this watch for over a year and it has worked great. Two weeks ago I went bodysurfing in San Diego and noticed the display was fading. The next day it was dead. I opened it up and there were no signs of any sea water getting into it. I replaced the battery and now only the bottom half of the display is visible. What gives? So much for the Ironman status.
3,Has uncommanded time zone changes,"The watch works as advertised except for one problem. I will occasionally find that it has changed to the ""T2"" time zone without any action on my part. This is annoying and has caused me to think I am late/or early for things (I use the second time zone for my job)."
2,Crapping out after 5-months,"After 5-months this watch is crapping out. These watches normally will last 3 or 4 years, so I probably just got a lemon. I would like to return it because it's still under warranty, but the return policy for this is not worth the trouble. They may or may not replace it or fix it, and you'll have to send them $7 with the watch just to see what happens. The other thing that bothers me, which is just a personal preference, is that the date is on the bottom of the display instead of the top."
1,IRONMAN ?,INSTRUCTIONS DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW WHILE WORKING WITH WATCH.BUTTON ENTREES LOCATED UNDER GLASS HARD TO SEE.THOUGHT PRODUCT DESCRIPTION A BIT MISLEADING---EXPECTED AUTOMATIC TIME UPDATES
5,Solid,"Great affordable watch. I use it for tri training and everyday use at the office. 100 lap Chronograph with date memory is nice and watch is not too bulky under wetsuit. 2 slight downfalls: 1) Flix light is difficult to trigger and 2) the piece that holds the remaining watch band doesn't lock properly, especially while swimming."
4,Timex Ironman TSE241,"I wanted a watch which could record split and lap times for my running. After reading the specs of a number of watches, I chose the Timex TSE241 as it offered the best value for money. The watch arrived within a week of placing the order, which is very good considering I am in Sydney, Australia. I am very pleased with the watch. It is lightweight and comfortable to wear, and it is easy to record a series of split times when I am running. It does everything I want and was not expensive. I can recommend this watch."
3,"Love the watch, but it has it's bugs","I looked and looked and looked for a new watch when my last Timex saw it's last days. I decided on this one, even went to the store to put my hands on it since no one could touch amazon.com's price. Firstly I must say that I love this watch! Fr the many reasons already listed. But this is now my second one of this watch, both have ended up having problems with the buttons not operating any more. This defect is beginning to upset and frustrate me. Just out of the blue, none of the buttons work. I can't even shut off my alarm which goes off at 7:38 and 7:43 each morning. So all I can do is tell what time it is. It's going back to Timex."
2,does not survive water,"Washed dishes with the watch on, not my usual practice, and several hours later the display had faded away. It is supposed to be waterproof to 100m ?"
1,Very poor quality,"A poor quality watch which malfunctioned two weeks after I bought it.The buttons were difficult to work from the beginning, and have nowstopped functioning altogether.This purchase was a waste of money and time.I would not recommend this watch to anyone."
2,Intervals,"Does not do alarms for intervals under 15 seconds which is useless for 400 meter training, when you have to run 12 and 13 second splits"
5,Scandtastic.,"Firstly I apologise for the title of the review, I don't know what came over me.I bought this album on recommendation so I didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised.What you get from this Swedish duo, is fabulous sunny pop, wry humour and a bucket load of instantly catchy melodies. There really is not a duff track on the album. I guess you'd have to place this in the 'indie ghetto' but I wish so-called main stream pop could be this effortlessly enjoyable.Go on take a gamble, like I did. If you like your music with some rough edges left unpolished, and full of joyous melodic sunshine, I don't think you'll regret it."
4,Great Upbeat Sound!,"I first heard Joy the Bug when they came to my church and played live. The band members were not only extremely nice, but they have a wonderful upbeat sound that leaves you singing the songs long after you're done listening. The lyrics are thoughtful and fun... it's the kind of music that you won't mind listening to every day. I definitely recommend it."
1,CURSE OF THE OSCAR WINNER,"F. Murray Abraham stole an Oscar away from Tom Hulce for AMADEUS and hasn't done anything worthwhile since. Prime example is the horrifyingly bad dud, THE THIRD SOLUTION. Incredibly slow and amazingly confusing, the script is so disjointed that even when you've finished the movie, you're not sure what the whole thing was about. Suffice to say involves some kind of secret organization trying to stifle the Pope's visit to Moscow. But that's just the only thing I could figure out. Who are the heroes and who are the villains is up in the air. Treat Williams, who can be very good (Prince of the City) is awful in this role; Danny Aiello (Goodfellas) is likewise terrible; in fact, the whole cast bites the big one.Don't waste your time on this early Thanksgiving turkey!!!"
2,I need room to breathe after listening to this album :(,"Hmmm I like Reba, so I got this album. Boy I sure wish I didnt! The songs are sooo boring and stale to me. I would much rather prefer newer albums from Reba."
1,ONE STAR TOO MANY!!,I must have been a fool to think that I could have spent good hard earned money on a piece of junk like this!!
1,CD DOES NOT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS,"REBA should have allowed herself some more room to breathe. I tried very hard to like this CD but I just couldn't. The CD is a mixture of pop sounding tunes with one real country song on it. McEntire isn't winning many raves from this CD. She has done a lot better in the past. I'm giving up on country music because when stars like McEntire compromise themselves just to do what sells to the masses, that tells me there is no integrity in that individual. I agree with the review below that success changed one who was once a humble, country girl before she ""went hollywood"" and decided that she was the best country singer and actress on the planet. Not! This is the last CD of hers I'll ever buy."
1,Lackluster CD; Typical Country Pop,"If you like today's make believe country then this is the CD for you. All the ballads sound exactly alike, the uptempo tunes have no substance to them and McEntire warbles on as usual in her big egotistic way! This is not country music and this is one CD I will also sell at my next yard sale!"
1,IT GETS WORSE WITH EACH LISTEN,"As quite a number of reviewers here have noted, I bought this CD with great anticipation only to be thoroughly disappointed. This CD has very little credence and is definitely not one of McEntire's more creative efforts. Her talent is wasted. I thought that it would get better as most music does, the more it is played. Well, I've listened and listened to it but just the opposite is true with this. It does NOT get better. It gets worse. A disappointed listener."
1,REBA NEEDS TO TRY SOMETHING NEW!!,"Lets face it. All her CDs sound alike. There is nothing new here that she has not attempted before in better projects. As for it being classified as country, I beg to differ because that is not what I hear and definitely, not what I believe country to be. And I agree with the reviwer who wrote that the cover displays an unflattering Reba who looks like she needs a breath of fresh air!!"
1,I DON'T HEAR MUCH TRADITIONAL COUNTRY IN THIS CD,"This CD is the pits!! WHen I think of traditional country I think of waltzes, shuffles and texas swing. There is nothing resembling that on this CD. This is just more of Reba's pop drivel which I am frankly sick and tired of. Everything sounds the same as her other albums."
1,NOT GOOD,This is more of the same pop stuff Reba has been recording for years now. I agree with the reviewer who wrote that she needs to try something new because all of her music sounds alike.
4,"Not Reba's best, but certainly very good.","Reba McEntire is at it again! While this isn't her best album (that would be READ MY MIND), it still shows a strong Reba, singing with gusto, emotion and telling a story better than anybody else in country music today.While the songwriting falters in places, Reba still manages to mine some excellence from the material she is given. ""Secret"", ""I'm Gonna Take That Mountain"" and the title track, ""Room To Breathe"" are good songs, that are made better by Reba's powerful and knowing delivery.But the stand-out tracks emerge when excellent songwriting is paired with Reba's outstanding interpretive skills. Songs like the poignant ""He Gets That From Me"" and the clever album closer ""Somebody"", show that Reba can still hit you right where you live.Not a five star affair, but certainly a strong album."
3,"So, So.","Not one of my favorite Reba Albums but not my least favorite. ""I'm gonna take that mountain,"" Definitely lived up to my expectations. And some of the other songs I would listen to from time to time. In my opinion it needs more twang, and to be more personal. Possibly some more songs written by Reba. Its definitely obvious Reba has two irons in the fire (Music and her tv show). She still has what it takes but needs to put more heart into it."
4,Solid Effort By McEntire,"For the last few years McEntire has taken back seat to the new Diva Craze hitting country music. With her last 4 singles hitting the top 3 on the Billboard charts, she decided to take an old familar road, and it works.Going back to the basics, Room To Breathe feels brings back to life classic Reba.From the loss of a loved one ""He Gets That From Me"" a song about a mother looking at her son, and seeing a little piece of the man she lost in him, to the fiesty ""I'm Gonna Take That Mountain"" she grabs the listen by the ears and says check me out.Stand out tracks: Somebody #1 single, I'm Gonna Take That Mountain and It Just Has To Be This Way (duet with Vince Gill)Highly recommened for people familar with Reba, for someone new, and not sure which album to buy, I suggest Greatest Hits Volume 2, which is filled with 10 of Reba's strongest hits."
3,An O.K. Reba Album....,"The only songs I really like from Room To Breathe are: My Sister, Room To Breathe, Sky Full Of Angels & Somebody.... It's an alright Reba album but not an all out done album like Reba usually makes... The good thing is atleast if Reba doesn't make a good album there is always one or two songs you will fall in love with..."
2,Disapointing,"Lead off by an average first single ""I'm Gonna Take This Mountain"", that is sadly how most of this cd shapes up. having been her first CD in a few years, there should have been plently of time to find a better crop of songs then this. Disapointing."
2,STILL OVERPRODUCED BUT NOT HALF BAD,"Best Song: Moving OletaWorst SOng: SecretBiggest Let Down: I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain and Sky Full of Angels. (Patty Loveless could have done wonders with these!)Other Good Songs: If I Had Any Sense Left At All; Room to Breathe; He Gets that From Me; Once You've Learned to Be Lonely;Forgettable: Love Revival; Somebody;O.K. - The Duet with Vince Gill which made such an impression on me that I can't even remember the name of the tune.The CD is way overproduced just like Reba's normal fare. But the material here isn't half bad. ""Moving Oleta"" should have been released as the single and should be winning awards for ""Song of the Year"". By far one of Reba's most moving performances!"
1,ANOTHER BUBBLEGUM POP OFFERING,"""If I Had any Sense at All"" I would have advised Reba McEntire to give herself some more ""Room to Breathe"" and have kept this CD a ""Secret"". ""Somebody"" should have asked a ""Sky Full of Angels"" to keep this ""Love Revival"" from taking place. ""My Sister"" warned me about purchasing this Cd and told me I wouldn't like it but ""Once You've Learned to Be Lonely"" you won't listen to the advice of others. I was too busy ""Moving Oleta"" (my goldfish) to another part of the house that the music failed to move me in any way. I also had to contend with packing my Son's mountain climbing gear while he told me ""I'm Gonna Take that Mountain"" and I told him to take the CD too because I didn't want it around. He refused because he's stubborn, but then ""He Gets that From Me"". I was sorely disappointed in this CD, but then, I guess ""It Just Had to Be This Way"". I've learned now to expect nothing but mediocre stuff from Reba since she stopped recording real country."
1,Worst Release I have ever heard from Reba!!!,"I have always been a huge fan of Reba. However, this album has bored me. To me it has not life to it. Reba to me has always symbolized great energy and fire. This album has not shown me that. I love Reba and love her television show and have always loved her acting and movies. I dont know what is missing with this album, it just doesnt seem like the Reba I have always known and loved."
5,The Queen Returns!,"This album is one of the best. It has a great mix of uptempo, optomistic songs and tear-jerking ballads. Every song on the CD is worth listening to. Reba is back, filling the void she left in country music four years ago. Long live the queen!~Rachael~"
1,I DIDN'T LIKE IT,I wish I could say that I like this CD. I have listened to it many times and I just find nothing here that makes Reba special. Its just an ordinary country/pop collection.
2,NOT UP TO PAR,"First the good songs: ""Moving Oleta"" as others have singled out is a standout. I also like ""Room to Breathe"" but its melody is almost identical to that of ""Moving Oleta"". Only the lyrics are different. I don't like the bluegrass stuff mostly because its too overdone. ""Love REvival"" is terrible. ""My SIster is o.k....the lyric is great but its just too contemporary. ""If I Had Any Sense Left At All"", ""Once You've Learned to Be Lonely"" and ""He Gets that From Me"" are all similar in tempo and sometimes melody. ""Secret"" is crossover stuff that doesn't do a thing for me. If you get this CD get it for one song...""Moving Oleta"". Otherwise this is another one to pass by. Save your money."
5,Reba Always Gives Me Room To Breathe,"Reba's long awaited new album, ROOM TO BREATHE, is a must have for anyone who is a fan of any type of music. Reba has selected some wonderful material from all different genres- country, gospel, bluegrass... She did not disappoint her legion of fans with this come back album. Each song is wonderfully recorded and sounds great. Some of my personal favorite tracks are 'Secret', 'Somebody,' and 'Room to Breathe.' This album definetely deserves your attention whether you are a Reba fan or not."
1,A Dissapointment!,"When I read in TV guide a couple of weeks ago that Reba was returning to her roots (meaning recording real country...not the mish/mash hodge podge that makes her sound like everyone else out there...) I rushed right out to buy this CD when it was released. I should have known better just by looking at the cover. Reba McEntire may sound country when she talks but the songs she picks to sing tell another story. Reba was born to sing 'traditional' country!! Aside from ""Gonna Climb that Mountain"" which is great, the rest of the CD is a disappointment! Reba tries to outdo herself but in so doing let's herself and us down. Just like her television show. Reba cannot act, and as is evidenced by this CD...she cannot sing...at least like she used to...a long time ago when she was 'real' country before she sold out to do as she herself put it...'what sells'. What a shame. I should have known better!"
1,THERE IS ONLY ONE COUNTRY QUEEN AND ITS NOT REBA!!!,"I am sick of reading reviews calling Reba the Queen of Country Music. Anyone who knows anything about country music knows that there is only ONE QUEEN and that person is Kitty Wells. Reba herself will attest to that...if her ego lets her.As for this CD, I hadn't bought a REBA CD since the disastrous ""Rumor Has It"" years ago. I thought I'd give her another chance after reading some of these reviews. Wrong. The CD contains only one true bona-fide country tune but the rest is no different than the 'awful' country music of today.But that's o.k. Everyone has different tastes. But quit calling Reba the ""Queen"". She will never compare with Kitty, Loretta, Tammy or the best female singer ever to rock this planet.....""Patsy Cline""."
1,THE WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR,"This is the WORST album from Reba ever. The songs are drab and dopey. The album is depressing and has NO flavor. I have every Reba album ever released and have seen her in concert 96 times. I know her potential as an artist and she has totally missed her mark. Perhaps she's so busy finding her mark in Hollywood that she's forgotten her grass roots self in the studio with country music. She's notorious for cute, sassy, fun, hip songs, none of which appear in this album. If you're looking to be incredibly bored then this is the album for you!"
3,NEVER TOO LATE TO TURN ON!,"TEN YEARS TOO LONG. FANS OF ALVIN LEE&CO. HAVE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR NEW OR UNRELEASED TRACKS BY THIS PHENOMENAL GUITARIST. THIS LISTENERS EARS WERE PLEASED! ""BABY WONT YOU LET ME ROCK& ROLL YOU"" WITH A DIFFERENT TWIST! ALL HAIL, ALVINS BACK!"
4,gel/lather machine,"The product is good for the money it cost. I owned an earlier model, but it didn't really warm the shaving cream. The only problem I have is that even when the temperature is lowered (via its directions) the cream is a bit (runny) and not a thick lather."
3,The Servants of Minds Eye Theatre Kindred,"While lacking some of the detail that ""Ghouls:Fatal Addiction"" (the White Wolf table-top sourcebook for ghouls), Liber des Gouls certainly provides more than enough information to play a ghoul in any Minds Eye Theatre(MET) game. Full character creation rules, as well as all the nifty little ""ghoul-specific"" odds and ends make this book a necessity to play one of the servants of the damned..."
1,Waste of money,"The author might be a respectful developer for MacOS 7, but he obviously have just discovered development with MacOS X (and in particular Cocoa). There is not a single bit of anything ""advanced"" in this book, and the author obviously have no idea about Object Oriented techniques, neither he understands the design behind Cocoa. And there are definitely better intro texts about PHP. Does the author know that Apple runs WebObjects on MacOS X - set of frameworks lightyears ahead of PHP?In summery, this is #1 worst book about MacOSX development, and a very wrong one to be sure!"
2,Sirius Motorcycle Mount,The motorcycle mirror mount doesn't have sufficient strength on the ball joint to keep the radio from constantly falling (not in place).
1,Disappointed,"This kit only allows for clamping on round tube handlebars and does not fit Honda Goldwings. After paying a healthy price for a ""Universal"" Mounting Kit, I find that I have to have parts machined to make it work.This is NOT a ""Universal"" Mounting Kit."
3,Not the best product,"Although the kit has plenty of extra parts to adapt to several motorcycle applications and was easy to install, the mount is weak. I've been unable to tighten the mount enough to hold it into position and I'm constantly facing the radio back up so I can see the display while riding. I'm going to keep looking for something better"
2,Less than great,This kit uses and older docking station that will not lock in most newer Sirius radios. The antenna also is not very good and gets very poor reception with many drop outs. I replaced it with a stanadrad sirius micro dot antenna and the reception improved greatly. I also swapped this docking station with the one in my car since i am not worried about the raiod flying off in my car. IMHO save your money and buy a sirius radio with car kit and then purchase an after market gadget mount to mount it on your bike. You will get a better docking station and antenna and the after market mounts are better than this.
4,Sirius Motorcycle Mount,"After purchas of the mount, I was pleased with the ease of installation due to excellent instructions and that the mount did not ""clutter"" up the bike aesthetics. I immediately did 1600 miles on the motorcycle, and the only downside that I could determine was that road vibration did cause the Sirius to move downward making the screen difficult to see, however this was a minor inconvienence."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this ointment because it's called Tucks - I love Tucks, the medicated witch hazel pads that I use every day, and I had hoped that the ointment also contained witch hazel. To my great disappointment, it doesn't. It is very greasy and doesn't relieve discomfort and pain."
4,Good introductory,This actually was the textbook used for the desktop publishing class that I took in college. More than adequate as a starter for those interested in learning design theory.
4,Review of Desktop Publishing and Design for Dummies,"Already having a background in Desktop Publishing and Design, I intend to use the manual as a professional ready reference for the subject, and a book to turn to when I need to beef up on specific areas on the subject."
4,Where were you?,"Most of the reviews don't rate this album right. It's like they heard a different CD. ""Can't Truss It"", and ""By the Time I Get To Arizona"" were both big hits. True heads hear me though!"
4,It's All Good.,"This is album is all good. But there's one problem, some of it's profanity and slangs is cut out or replaced by other words, I've read the lyrics inside the album cover and there was cuss words on it, but when I listen to it they were either cut out or replaced by some other word. Is there a edited and unedited version of is album? or did Chuck D change the lyrics himself before releasing the album or while recoding? Anyways, this album is the best P.E. album ever. ""He Got Game"", ""Greatest Missis"", ""Yo! Bum Rush The Show"", and ""There's A poison Goin'On"" are great too. But not as great as this one. If you are a big hardcore rap fan, than you should get this album. It is worth your money."
4,Children's poetry in a fearful dream-like setting.,"Tog the Ribber is strangely interesting book about a young girl who wrongly passes through the domain of a well known and dangerous ghost on her way to her home. What happens to her because of this mistake, changes her life. This is a book on fear. The illustrations are well thought out and the lyrics are nicely written and corrupted in the point of view of a person deliriously frightened. At first, the over-all impression of the book is dream-like. However, as the reader progresses through the poem, things become more frantic and real. This book is not for very young children. The illustrations can seem too far-fetched and graphic. I believe older children(9-12) would grasp the meaning of such a book better."
4,It ain't for kids,"I've assembled two mayflowers and at least 2 paper villages by AG Smith. The ships made nice table decorations for thanksgiving. They were satisfying to build but not that easy. It took about a week in one hour sessions. I found that a glue stick was the best assembly adhesive. Depending on the dwelling/ship there may be internal cutting required necessatating a razior blade or X-acto knife. I would like to see a companion set to the Mayflower in the form of Plymouth Plantation-pilgrim houses, indian longhouses, plymouth rock etc... I'd also like to see this ship kit in a waterline model vice the full hull."
5,A Gem of a Book,"One of a fantastic series of 4 chuck full of informational volumes dedicated to a particular geographic area. A must for any rock hound weather you travel or just live in the geographic area of the volume. If you can afford it, get all 4 regional volumes. Start with your area. The location information brake down of the minerals to be found in each state counties is so valuable you can't do with out it. Saves time, eliminate barren hunting grounds and it's so detailed as to where and how you find the minerals. This is just one of a fact full accurate guide series you'll want to have in your rock library. Don't settle for an older printing, this one is reprinted and has been updated."
4,O.K. Very Creative,"Opinion: I've read alot of Neal Shusterman books and I've loved them all. The Eyes of Kid Midas didn't capture me the way the others did.Summery: When Kevin Midas decides to follow a story that his teacher tells, he soon finds himself in a strange place. When he finds a pair of sun glasses, he soon realizes they aren't just any sunglasses. These sunglasses let him change anything he wants. Any thing he says is true! How cool is that? But with a few misplaced words here and there, Kevin changes two lives forever! Unless, he can get time going again!"
3,Watch out . . . .,"The real price of this program is actually $.. more than what's listed.The product itself is excellent. Easy to use, great for what I bought it for, which is digitizing old LPs and removing years of scratches and crackles.I was really, really annoyed, though, to find that the MP3 converter (converts WAV files to MP3) only works 20 times unless you pay an extra $.. (well, $..) for an upgrade via the Internet. Seems like they ought to tell you this somewhere upfront."
4,"Despite bug, an impressive program for the price","First of all, I will affirm the complaint of several other reviewers: Audio Cleaning Lab was NOT able to burn CDs with my system. Nevertheless, this software is able to do something relatively few others can -- rip LPs, cassettes, etc. and clean the audio to the point that they almost sound like a new CD. If you already have a program that can burn audio CDs from .wav files or MP3s, then use that (if not, you can get one for almost nothing these days). Use Audio Cleaning Lab to rip, edit, clean, and mix your .wav's/MP3s, and you're set. For the price, I still think it's worth buying, even if it doesn't actually burn CDs on your system."
3,Why such an ending?,The ending was truly unsatisfactory. I agree with the rest of the reviews. If you are going to have a romance like that at least end it well or else give the readers a sequel. It nice to see that I wasn't the only one disappointed with the ending.
2,Good Book Terrible End,"As I read this book I feel in love with Frank. I was really rooting for him until the end. The ending of a book is the most important part, it could make or brake the book. In Roby's case it broke it. It left too many questions unanswered. Its a good book until the end."
2,"Good read, but ending questionable?","The book was a good read except for the ending, I really didn't care for Frank's wishy-washy emotions, where his ex-wife was concerned. I am a die-hard believer in good ending romance novels, and the way this one was left up in the air with the couple left me disappointed and not satisfied with the book."
3,a wild fun game,"Our 7 year old grand daughter, enjoyed throwing the meatball and spaghetti at plates. fast game"
4,FUN GAME,"We bought this for our 4 year old son and he loves it! After a little practice, he really got the hang of it and enjoys playing it. His 7 year old brother enjoys playing too."
5,A must have for any B*witched fan. It's great!,"Package arrived very quickly, received notice of shipment and I got my item the next day. VHS was new, in original packaging as far as I could tell, as described and there were no problems with the video itself. Would buy from this seller again. As a fan of B*Witched in my childhood, I was happy to find this item."
5,A great bathroom book!,"This book, patterned after the game ""Trivial Pursuit"" taught me more than I ever could have guessed about the state of Montana even though I've lived here over 20 years. The book really covers all the bases, with interesting and surprising questions divided into six categories: History, Geography, Science, Entertainment, Literature, and Sports. I keep my copy in the bathroom, but it's also a great book to keep in the glove box (for entertainment on those long drives across the state)or in the camping gear (for campfire quizzes!). Teachers and students should also enjoy this book, which presents a ton of useful - and useless - information about Montana in a very easy-to-digest format."
4,Montana Trivia,"I found this read, interesting and for us trivia lovers, as well as Montana lovers, find this to be an enjoyable book. Some interesting bits of fact and trivia on Montana."
5,this boombox kicks...,"This is a very good boombox, nicely packaged, easy controls, and a natural display of its parts. The sound is better than expected for a boombox of this price, would have expected it to cost [more] at the local stores. The colors go so very nicely with my bedroom furniture, that it seems to have been made just for it. The CD player is very easy to use and its sound is just like being at the Music Concert Hall downtown. This lets me record directly into the cassette player and give them to my friends at school, who really like the quality of the recordings so far. Overall it is a great boombox with a digital tuner that makes listening to my favorite radio channels a breeze. Thanks Phillips for such a well designed item."
1,I remember this junk!,"This tastes like rubbish, but French women drink it anyway for some odd reason. Acquired taste is right, blech!"
3,Majority of French female drink this.,"Since I lived in France for four years, I suprised that majority of French female drink this water espeically young age female between 21 to 40. The volume of consumers almost compare to American diet Coke drinkers. I personaly did not like the taste of the water, I think for French ladies, its the results not the taste is important. They want to loose waste. The taste is not going to stop them. I am not fat, so this is not an option for me as it right now."
1,Tap Water,I swear this is Venice Beach tap water. I wouldn't wash my clothes in this water. My mouth has a soapy salt lick residue after taste.
4,insight to signature fender telecaster styles/sounds,"this video and the accompanying booklet provide great insight for the beginner or experienced player to the equipment spec's., and details of special tunings, chord-voicings and techniques of the most prominent and enduring telecaster driven superstars. i have not been able to find a second, or follow-up volume to this video (an effort well-warranted). nonetheless, if you're looking for a launching point from which to delve further into the playing of superstars like danny gatton, james burton, johnny lang, albert lee, kieth richards, and andy summers- this is money and time well spent."
3,Not so good!,"I recieved this product as a christmas gift. Overall I would give it five stars, but unfortunately it stoped working after 15 months I guess that's its life. It has great sound, look, it even has a remot control."
4,Public domain... read online,"In case you want to read this and don't have $1100.00 to cough up, go here:[...]Not as handy as the real thing, but alot cheaper."
3,Size misleading,"The material is 6 x 6 inches, not the 6.5 x 8.5 listed in the product information. Other than that, it is as described - I only needed the cork gasket material but this piece is too small."
3,My own confusion,"I guess I figured if it said 1/16th"", that would apply to the rubber also. I needed just a small piece of rubber, 1/16"" or less. But the rubber in this kit is closer to 1/8"" and too thick for my purposes. The product is okay, but It didn't work for my purposes."
5,Excellent Digital Camera,"While camera brands such as Canon, and Nikon, get most of the media play, Panasonic also has an excellent line up of top grade cameras. The DMC FZ50 is the top of the line in a NON DSLR. Great quality pictures from 36MM wide angle to 425MM Telephoto. The body utilizes Panasonics world leading stabilization system as well."
4,Great Camera,"Lots of features! Still getting used to the modes and feel of the camera, but it is a great camera. I've only had it for a month. The picture quality is good but it can be better. My previous camera was an olypmus C765 which was awesome but had no optical image stabilization, which was one of the reasons for a switch. However, image quality on the olympus was excellent.I watched the tutorials on panasonic's web site soon after receiving the camera, which helped getting acquainted with it. I am able to take better pictures as well as take pictures that you can't get on auto mode, like lit up christmas trees in a night scene.All in all, I am very pleased with my camera."
4,Great camera. Lottsa picture noise though.,"This camera is awesome overall.Just that the amount of noise you get in low light situations is kinda crazy. I was photographing sports outdoor and i got almost no noise,pictures were bright and vibrant without ANY blurring.Then I tried to photograph a Taekwondo tournament, indoor under low light... the noise and blurry was ridiculous. If anybody can suggest better settings for me for this situation please let me know."
5,Great!,"I love this camera, as a design student I try to stay away from stock images and i try to take my own pictures, this camera really fits me well, those 10 mp really work well for all my purposes. the only thing is that you don't get to change lesses but hey! even without that it is still great, really good closeups too! Best Camera i've ever had! get it!"
