2,One of Prong's weakest records,"To me, this will always be ""That album that was released on the same day as Nevermind by Nirvana"". If you don't have any Prong records, I recommend just about any of them before this one. Well, except for Scorpio. That one's even worse than this. If you've really got your dander up, find copies of Primitive Origins and Force Fed and just leave it at that."
2,What a total letdown....then AND now.,"I was a big fan of Prong when they released 'Force Fed' and 'Beg to Differ', but when this CD came out I lost faith really quick. It is just flat out BORING. One thing I definitely require in my metal is that it not be boring. It is the same band, but with all of the energy sucked out of them. The only song that is actually good metal on here is 'Unconditional'. So save your money and just buy that one track.I was a staunch metalhead back when this came out...so I thought that maybe now that my tastes have expanded that I would give this release another try...so I did, and it's STILL boring. Some of these reviews calling it a masterpiece just blow my mind.For the record, I have been a fan again of everything they released AFTER 'Prove You Wrong'."
2,A let down after Beg To Differ,"This album in my opinion has a few good songs; Irrelevant Thoughts, Unconditional, Prove You Wrong and Get a Grip (on Yourself) other than that this album is crap."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!,"Easy to understand, fun to learn. I've bought several books but this is the one that I found to be the BEST in every sense of the word."
5,McFarlane Owens is Awesome!,Normally these go for about $30 in the store...Got mine on Amazon.com for about $8 not including shipping...Came in perfect shape...Very good deal.
5,Everyone is a suspect!,"At least one time in the book, the author makes the reader suspect every character! I do not recommend books to friends very often, but this one is making the rounds at work! And everyone is saying the same thing....everyone could be the suspect!"
4,a good story,This is a good story by a writer I have enjoyed in the past. Suspenseful with a little romance. A book to enjoy if you like a mystery.
3,A brief overview,"It is extemely hard to condense the complexity and breadth of EAI in one book. This book gives a good quick overview without going in deep.The other problem with writing a book of this nature is the danger of being obsolete even before publication. A fair bit of information is redundant, especially descriptions on companies and products.The book can also be better served with a case study or two.Overall a good attempt on a difficult subject. Being from a technical background, I did not gain much from reading this book. But I have found it useful suggesting this as recommended reading to non-technical managers who are contemplating Application Servers and EAI."
2,"Very generalized, little depth","The book provides a basic overview of the various technologies available for application integration. However, there is little discussion of any issues or techniques to apply to be successful at using these technologies. Coming from a technical background I found the discussion of enterprise architecture to be very generalized and of little value. Overall I didn't find this book useful in helping me learn how to apply any methodologies or techniques to succeed at enterprise integration."
2,Basic Education in Communications,"if you have spent some time in architecture and consulting this book might be disappointing. I bought this book because I wanted to hear something new about EAI - wanted to get some ""how to"" advice on typical forces, pitfalls and pragmatic solutions What I read (or better browsed through) were very basic concepts like ""what is data integration"" or ""what is functional integration"" or what is a message queue ... All things that you get from other titles onb distributed systems and some basics on data communications .. So .. not much specific on EAI here - for my goal disappointing"
2,Could be better,"I am disappointed in the Whitney Design trash can I purchased recently. If you don't pull out the can by gripping it in a specific way and pull a specific way, it sticks and you have to jerk it out. Also, it is not very sturdy and the can is not as substantial as I was expecting. It is rather flimsy compared to another brand my daughter bought at the same time."
1,Never buy Anything from Akai. There customer service abysmal,"Simlar to other reviews. My set starting loosing color after about 10 months. It took a month to get an authorized service center, another month for them to tell me it wasn't repairable now we are in Monthy 7 and still trying to get a commitment to getting a replacement TV shipped to me. These guys are crooks. Don't buy anything no matter with their logo on it no matter how great it might look."
3,"Good information, difficult to read","This book was cited by several editors on LinkedIn as a must for their reference shelves, so I ordered it immediately. As someone who edits professionally, I found the (small, odd face) type and the presentation did not serve me well. Perhaps it's one of those works that becomes more helpful with use. I haven't chucked it, but I can't say I use it."
4,Very Erudite,In searching for a good commentary to introduce my dad to the non speculative side of Revelations interpretation I was more or less stumped until I remembered this series by Baker. This series of commentaries is both easy to understand and displays proper attention to the proof for it's assertion in an easily checkable manner. Not a few of the other commentaries I looked at were very good at coming up with all sorts of nifty idea's but very bad at showing me how and were they had researched and based those ideas on something other then personal preference. Simple things like footnotes aside I also appreciated the focus of the commentary being primarily on how Revelations affects the worship of the saints in the present era. To many commentaries on this subject focus on the pie in the sky by and by and not enough on the reason the Revelations was given to us in the present.
3,Review,"One of the good books available in the market; however, as for electronic review tools, it only referred to Word 2003."
3,Couldn't figure out mirror adjustment,"I like this projector. Lightweight, modern. I have one problem, though. I bought it used and, the way that it is set up, the position of the mirror projects the image only onto the ceiling. I'm a pretty good tinker, and I could not figure out a way to adjust the mirror to reflect 90 degrees (straight ahead) without breaking some plastic tabs. There is no apparent user adjustment to the mirror angle. I chose not to break the tabs, and to mount my own mirror in place of the on-board mirror using duct tape. Can anyone tell me how this mirror can be adjusted. All the product info I've found on the internet sounds like this projector should be perfectly capable of projecting onto a wall straight ahead. I don't have the owner's manual, unfortunately. Wish I did."
1,a pity,"Lamentably, I can't say anything about this VHS as I bought many time ago but perhaps the douanes, airways, airports, X- rays or something else made the VHS arrived fully deleted. For me this is a simpathetic superb actress, still beautiful, perhaps some extremist witouth knowing reality about the islamic groups, but I think unable to make damage. Recently she has lost a daughter. The best for her."
5,"this is truly an experience of ""methenygroup Xstasy"" !!!","the intimacy of a private live show ... i was immersed in a flood of delight ... the group deeply sharing it's sound vision ... allowing the camera to capture the depth of the inner resonance of each player ... thank you pat,lyle,steve,paul,pedro, armando and the entire production team ... your love radiates .."
2,Disappointed Silverberg fan,"I bought the Kindle version on the strength of the (generally) positive reviews this novel had on Amazon. I was looking forward to Silverberg's great imagination and storytelling skills with this one, as I had never been disappointed with his works before. Sadly, by the third page, I knew that if my copy had been a real book, I would have thrown it at the nearest wall.The novel seems like an archaic (that's us) human's stream-of-consciousness rant at waking up in the far future, where he encounters different versions of humanity from the various epochs that have passed. Silverberg's depiction of future humans are interesting, but it was the stream-of-consciousness drivel that drove me up the wall!By the way, I haven't finished reading the book. I've been able to plod through two-thirds of the book in the weeks that I've had it, so maybe I can finish it in time for Christmas."
3,Sub Par,"For a book written by R.K, this is sub par. It mainly supports Network Marketing and does not dive into detail about much else. However, for a quick and easy read, cheap as well, not bad/good purchase."

2,Fluff,"This is a collection of very easy to read magazine articles.Some of them are quite good but overall the standard isn't that high - it seems that P.J. O'Rouke's name is being used to sell this book, he is not a major contributor.With some notable exceptions, there is isn't much depth to most of the articles although some are quite interesting. Most of it is just journalists writing for the sake of writing. Useful in a waiting room, or reading on short train/bus rides.This book will leave you with a feeling of being unsatisfied."
4,Gives good tan if you use it consistently,"I've found this product to provide a nice tan, if you take the time to apply it at least once a day for 4-5 days. The days you can get it on twice, such as in the morning and in the evening, you will really notice the difference.The color will fade after about the 2nd day, so you would need to put it on at least every other day to maintain that level of tan. But it will get you dark with consistent use.As far as washing off, I suppose it would if you bathed within a couple hours of putting it on. But I've never done that. What I would recommend is letting it dry for 15 minutes before you get into bed or do anything else that would rub on your skin."
1,Expired Product don't buy from here!,"Wish i could give them zero stars. I just received my product from this seller and I had hoped that the product would be better than what the previous reviews had stated, well was I wrong. I called Neutrogena and asked them to look up the lot number and of course this product is expired. It was made in 2005 and has a 24 month shelf life so even with the two years added to 2005 it has still been expired for 5 years. This seller is providing damaged goods. I have been trying to request a return but they still haven't labeled it as sold so i contacted Amazon and complained. Do not buy from here its not worth the hassle. The product doesn't work when expired, normally the lotion is white but in the bottles i received it was brown so that was the signal to call and find out if it was even a good product. No wonder why its such a good deal, its because they aren't selling legit products."
1,Useless,very dissatisfied with product - does absolutely nothing!!!Don't know why because I used to use this all the time &swore by it but they changed the bottle & obviously the product.
4,Very Nice!,"I recommend this product because it actually does work, unlike so many tanning moisturizers. I started using it because I had a nice tan from the sun, and i was sad that it was fading, so i started using this and i have to say, it's awesome!Pros: It works very fast, as long as you are consistent with applying it daily. It gives a natural look, and if you mess up applying one day you can always fix it the next. No streaks, as long as you do a job job applying it. Cons: it does smell a little odd, it's not a BAD smell, just... different. But that can be easily fixed, what i do is just apply it everywhere at night before i go to bed (let it dry for about 10 minutes though) and then it soaks in while i am sleeping, and i just take a shower in the morning with a slightly darker skin tone and my choice of body wash smell (strawberries!!!).Hope you try it out!!!~Maureen"
2,Product sold was 4 years past expiration date,"I ordered two of these. When the order arrived I noticed the cream was dark brown and had a strong smell. Being I've used this product several times before, the lotion was always white and had very little scent. I called Neutrogena and ask if they changed their formula. They said no. I gave them the LOT number which gives the Julian date and year is was bottled. They were bottled in 2005 and have a shelf life of two years so were expired in 2007. This is 2011. I contacted the seller, they didn't have any fresh product so promptly refunded my purchase. I'm thankful for that. I ended up buying fresh bottles at Target, which still had white lotion inside. I'm sure it was an honest mistake and am thankful for the refund however, I hope they pay closer attention that items are not expired before shipping."
2,"Smells, orangy tones",I couldn't get over the smell. And it didn't have a very nice tone to it. Only use if you want to darken an already dark tan. Doesn't blotch at least.
3,Alittle disapppointed,I received this quickly but was alittle disappointed because I hadbeen using the Neutragene white lotion and this one was slightly tinted.Didnt like the smell and it did not work as well as the white lotion.
1,turned me orange!,"I normally like Neutrogena products, but this product turned me orange (I'm fairly pale) and made me break out all over my skin. Not recommended."
2,cheap and performs like it,"I bought a new grill and wanted to make sure it was used properly. I don't like it when small pieces of food fall through, especially on gas grills, so I bought this. Well, on first use it stained so bad, despite my priming it, and worse, it warped. Hey, I can still use it. But it's kinda like wearing soiled clothes... won't feel as good."
5,Easy Clean Up Grill,This is a great grill topper if you have an older grill. It cleans up very easily and will not rust after cleaning like the coated ones. A great buy for the price.
4,Classic Roots,"These are classic throw backs, this is where it all began people! Cuts like A.J. scratch, Marley scratch, and ""Leaders of the pack"" by U.T.F.O are priceless. I grew up on this music and at 31 I still enjoy it! This is the foundation of hip hop from the top!"
3,Well...,"I had high hopes of this collection, but sadly, the humour is tepid, and the wisdom of the quotes is less than insightful. The chinese food quotes, for example, reflect a sort of ""insight"" that seems wildly outdated these days and rather xenophobic. Other topics covered are often as inane. I relish well turned phrases, and I like to think others do as well. There are few here. There are better resources, which are every bit as suitable for sermons. Only an average average book, more's the pity."
4,Just to clarify.....,"This video was specifically designed for teachers in training, that is why workout I and II are the same exercises. This tape is called ""intermediate"" not for the exercise progressions, but because the detailed explainations regarding muscle contraction, dynamics, etc. are more involved than in the workout I video. If you are considering this video for use as an at-home workout, you might be more satisfied with another product. If you have already been studying the Method for some time, you will find the information on this video helpful and interesting. I enjoyed the video very much, but it was required study material for me, so I don't think everyone will share my view. Hope this helps..."
3,Same ole thing,"This is wonderful Pilates video, but it is nearly the same as PhysicalMind Workout I. I was disappointed since I got the same workout in both vidoes, just different people."
5,Everyone Wants to Be Bad,"Really, most of us want to be bad. And Pat Dailey gives us permission -- even if only by appreciating his music celebrating drinking, sex, fishing, sex, lying . . . you get the picture. Dailey is a naughty balladeer: cross Willy Nelson with John Denver doing R-rated subject matter. And that doesn't do the man justice. He's unique, a one-of-a-kind bar poet of the heart and hormones, and a terrific guitar player as well. If you hear the man live and have had a few brews, you feel like you could be as sleezy as he pretends to be --whether you are 19 or 69. Listening to a CD is the next best thing--crank it up! I have most of his stuff and this is my favorite.Marsh Muirhead - Author of ""Key West Explained -- a guide for the traveler."""
2,Not Impressed,"The product is a cheap print of the actual movie poster. I was not at all impressed with the quality, could print it off like this on any printer."
5,cadillac of springform pans!,"I love this pan would recommend to anyone. Compared to other pans this one is durable, sturdy, high quality, heavy and you pay for what you get and this is worth every penny! I will never buy another pan. It is difficult to remove cheesecake from bottom BUT this really is a scratch resistant bottom so i've cut my cakes right on it with no problems!"
1,not as described,"I was looking for a springform pan for a particular recipe that called for 3"" sides. I was delighted when I saw that you had one so I ordered it. The item was misrepresented as the sides are like any other springform with 2"" sides. I am sure it is a good pan , but it didnot meet my expectations."
2,Seam came unraveled,I would have given these a great review except for the fact that a leg seam came unraveled after 3 washings. They run small so size up one size. They don't ride up. They don't roll at the legs. They are invisible under pants and they are comfortable. It's a shame they aren't made better. For the price I expected to have them around a bit longer than 2 months.
3,not bad,"i love the way the brish looks, but i do not like that the bristles are made out of sticks basically. i know it will not take them long to break. and the brish will be useless. the price is ok. but i couldv'e bought a more durable brush for less. when this one breaks down, i plan to remove the handly and attatch it to a newwer better brush. that was really the only reason i bought it."
2,not what I ordered per product description,"When I received the overhead projector it is a larger and older version of the overhead in the product description, also the glass has several deep gashes and blemishes from not being properly folded although the description stated ""like new"". This product has had a long and uncaring life that clearly shows. Certainly not what was advertised in product description, I will not order from this person again."
2,Disappointed,"I picked this up from a recommendation on amazon lists. The writing style is a half-hearted attempt to emulate the style of the 30's and 40's greats. It is fairly enjoyable reading with interesting characters, but the detective in this book never figures out anything. He has to be told everything even at the end, even though the reader will figure it out quite early on. I can't recommend it to anyone seriously interested in mysteries."
3,TERROR ON HORSEBACK BUSTER CRABBE WESTERN,THIS TAPE CONTAINS A MOVIE NOT ON DVD...I COLLECT THE BUSTER CRABBE BILLY THE KID WESTERNS AND THIS WAS A WELCOME ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION. THE MOVIE IS TYPICAL OF THE GENRE ... B-WESTERNS ARE BOTH GOOD AND BAD THIS TITLE IS ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE...IF YOU LIKE B-WESTERNS THIS IS WORTH THE PRICE...THIS IS NOT A BIG BUDGET MAJOR STUDIO PRODUCTION...
2,its ok,"the item has holes for a handle but it did not come with the handle and it should because its difficult taking it out of the coffee pot without dirtying your fingers or when its still hot, I need to buy another one with a handle"
3,Can't brew strong coffee,"I agree with the other reviewers that the size of the holes on the mesh are bigger so water passes through faster than it would on paper. The result is a watered-down coffee and lots of sludge. I have thePerma-Brew 3 Year Re-useable Coffee Filter, Fluted Basketand it works much better. It makes stronger coffee and no sludge. It works almost like a paper filter. I only looked for the steel mesh filter because the Perma-brew is made of Nylon which I thought wouldn't last as long as steel. I guess I will stick to it.I'm giving this 3 stars because it is well-made and looks good."
1,albino 3,Most people experience serial number troubleshooting with this synth. At the very last stage of download. The price tells the true story of this software. Save your money and use it towards something that wont drive you nuts just to install.ps. The worst customer support ever. Impossible to contact anyone.
5,The Last Of The Bandit Riders,"Matt Warner was a young man when he left home thinking he had killed another kid in his home town of Ephraim, Utah. He thought that he was a wanted man so he tried to avoid the law. One day in Colorado he met another young man from Utah by the name of Leroy Parker. Together they robbed a local mining company and thus started the friendship between Matt and Butch Cassidy (Parker). Although none of the Wild Bunch spent much time together they did pull some jobs together and Matt was with them on some of them. This story is Matt's own story as he told it to Murray E. King, author. I think it is exceptional reading if you want to learn about the life of one of the lesser known members of the Wild Bunch. You may be surprised to learn the demise of this outlaw."
5,Ana Barbara- Te Regalo La Lluvia!,"Where to start? This album is defenitely Ana Barbara's BEST in her 7 year career!! I think it will mark her point as a full on entertainer, especially in the Mexican territory. She has showed us her cumbia side for a while, and now it's time for a change. This album is like a chronicle of her recent breakup, although not all the songs were written by her, one could see that she has lived through every song; especially the 3 songs she wrote. If you like Pepe Aguilar and Alejandro Fernandez, then you'll love Ana Barbara's new album ""Te Regalo La Lluvia."""
2,Not a good money's worth,"This book was a little bit of an disappointment for me. It has good guidlines on how your cichlid aquarium should be and how to maintain it. But it doesn't tell you alot about the fish and lacks information about them such as habits, size, diet etc.I would not recomend this to a hobbyist who wants to learn more about the fish themselves."
2,No Good!,"This book has absolutely no value for me. Even though I have many aquariums with different cichlids ( Malawi, Discus, Scalare and Oscar). For example it has a chapter how generally describes how to funiture a cichlid aquarium. What`s the point, almost every cichlid demand different conditions. Discus vs. Malawi. The total lack of a register is also a big drawback. Another little thing is that the book is made by Tetra, so it includes a lot of their products. The book for example claims that Tetras sponge filters are the most efficient biological filter currently available. What a load of rubbish. My advise is to buy books about those areas (ciclids) you are interested in."
3,Very informative but too technical,"The book contains in-depth information and excellent pictures. However, Dr. Loselle's writing style is too technical for everage readers to understand. He should write it with plain English and minimze the use of technical jargons. His books should contain a glossary to define the jargons that he loves to use."
3,Great information and photos but not a good reference.....,This book does a great job of helping the beginner set up and maintain their first cichlid aquarium and is an excellent resource for learning about cichlid behaviors. The main drawback is with the lack of good index. It is nearly impossible to look-up any specific fish because they are not listed in the back of the book. Nice to have in your Cichlid library but you'll need more books to look up specific fish and their specific requiriements.
3,Fire the Editor,"This is a wonderfully done book, lavishly illustrated, concisely worded, and about as close to a comprehensive treatment as one has a right to expect in a single-volume, non-technical treatment. So who was the bright guy who forgot to do the index? What in the world was the editor thinking to mar such a great volume with something that even the smallest, cheapest, most basic hobby guide includes as a matter of course? By all means, buy the book, but be prepared to scan each and every one of the 517 photographs to find the fish you are looking for."
5,Handy & Durable CD Cases,"These cases are simply the best ever for transporting music CDs between players inside or outside your home or in the car. Each tough, colorful case is molded polyethylene (think: plastic milk carton) with a slot in one end (instead of opening with a hinge). A cleverly placed lever pops the CD out about half way. My favorite technique is to pop the CD out of the case (one handed) right into the slot of my car CD player. It's promptly taken in, never touching the CD at all. Extracting the CD the same way is just as easy. Great design!"
3,Probably GOOD for GMAT but definitely NOT for GRE,"I don't have this book but I've read its table of content. The material is TOO EASY for GRE in Math. Probably it is good for your GMAT but definitely not for GRE. It does not contain much information about Calculus and Algebra (well, it does contain elementary algebra which is not useful for GRE). If you're preparing for GRE in Math, do not choose this book."
2,3RD EDITION..SAME AS 2000TH EDITION,"Shocked and flabbergasted to find that the 2000th edition has same information, page by page as an edition done in 1992. What a rip off. A useful guide but very misleading, so if you have an older edition, please use it and DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Excellent for students with Math phobia.,"This book is essential for anyone who needs a refresher in Arithmetic, Algebra and Geometry. It teaches the rules very well -- better than many math courses I have taken. It is extremely beneficial in increasing GMAT score. Definitely worth the investment. I also used the Princeton version. I found it less effective in teaching math concepts."
3,"Good book, but...","I bought this book because I needed help with some math topics tested on the GMAT. It helped me, but I recommend this book for test takers who have no idea how to sum fractions or how to solve a quadratic equation. If you are above 70% percentile this is not the book you need. Furthermore, this review doesn't content statistics, combination and permutation, and probability. I took the GMAT and I got 3 statistics, 4 combination and 8 probability questions, very hard questions. The test taker should take into account that the math section is harder than ever."
2,A wholly inadequate documentary,"I was disappointed when I saw this film. It was not nearly thorough enough for a much more complicated subject. It completely ignored the fighting prowess of the divisions and the atrocities they committed. It most dealt with how they were treated after the war. I was thrilled to see a video about this underexposed subject, but in the end I was disappointed. I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for what I'm looking for..."
2,Too much or not enough?,"That is the question one asks. Unfortunately, this liner provides no answers. It's not very effective as your guard against winter's chill, but go inside and you'll soon be dripping with sweat. Dripping with sweat is bad when you have to go back outside. I found a simple wool cap to be much better, and a nomex skull cap also works nicely."
2,Disappointing,"This is not the best of ""Crank Yankers"". It is missing the two funniest skits--- the fertility clinic with Sarah Silverman and the dude ranch skit. I want my money back."
1,Who put this together,OH MY HEAD! They did an AWFUL job with this collection. CY was always hit or miss & they chose like 90 of the MISS sketches here. STAY AWAY!
3,Almost Passable,Does what is supposed to do. At every connect/disconnect it feels like it is going to fall apart
2,This isn't a firm pillow,"This isn't a firm pillow at all. It's not heavy, it has no density... Not as a good latex pillow should be. It wont support weight, sometimes it even feels like I'm sleeping without a pillow, no support at all. Don't trust the advertisement or the ""premium"" tag they put to it. It isn't a premium. If you want a good latex pillow try to get a dunlopillow. Used to have one of those, they were firm. Sadly to me they don't sell them any more near where I am."
3,Handy but not egronomic,"the tools are handy and easy to use but the finishing is not that good neither ergonomic, the foil cutter and stopper are made of a weak plastic material which might broke while using them. the best thing is the corkscrew which is stainless steel."
1,Incompetent garbage,"This book belongs to the first generation of flamenco guitar transcriptions, which were often apparently done by pianists with no clue about the guitar. The transcriptions in this book are a) inaccurate, and b) unplayable.What you need is eitherJoseph Trotter's book of transcriptions in staff notation(Hansen Publications); or, presumably,Juan de la Mata's book, which I haven't yet had a chance to look at, but which has to be better than this mess."
2,Nope!,"This product has an artificial preservative in it and it should not! The herbs, spices and honey in this ancient formula are perfectly adequate for preserving the product. Otherwise it seems ok, but the fact it contained preservative was not made clear in product description before ordering, and if the company is out of touch enough to include unhealthy and unnecessary ingredients it makes me wonder about the quality of the other ingredients. I will definitely order a different brand when I need more. There are many good companies that do not use preservatives, and the formula is a wonderful source of Vit C and many other vital nutrients. Also the seller sent me one container and there were supposed to be 3 in a pack. They never answered me when I contacted them, and Amazon had to make good on the order for me."
2,"ehh, not so much","meh. Too difficult to deal with. I'm more used to just poppin' my Flintstones Daily Vitamins and this is just too messy to deal with daily in the morning when I am trying to get out the door to work.Besides that, the expiration date is not that far out and you've got to buy it in a 3 pack...hello...I live alone.Sorry, may be right for many others...but not for me."
3,Took too long to arrive,"Good stuff, but wouldnt have ordered it if I had known it would almost a month getting here. Spoiled by Prime, I guess!"
5,"No Skid, No Slip, Stair Treads - these REALLY work!!","I put these self-stick treads on high traffic porch stairs that were recently painted with a high gloss, extremely slippery when wet, outdoor paint. These treads grip better than anything I've tried before - they hold your step like glue! Perfect for seniors and little kids! Truly NO SKID, NO SLIP. Love this product.**Note: You need to be sure they are where you want them when you attach them because they really stick securely and immediately once the adhesive touches down."
1,Not what I expected,"This product did not meet my expectations for a stair tread. They were like thick sandpaper, which would not have been comfortable to walk on barefooted, and they had a peel off backing to be self adhesive which would have damaged the wooden steps. I could only order 3 at a time, so I had to order 4 times to have enough for the entire set of steps."
1,Not for a Climber,Love mountains. Love mountain books. However this book is NOT about Mt. Shasta. At least not from a climbers perspective. Maybe for someone else but not for me.
4,Everything in it,"I remember reading this in 8th grade - i loved it so much i photocopied it from the library. The nice thing about this book is that although Tatiana was so different from me or from any of my friends, I could totally identify with what she was feeling - especially her utter confusion in the grown-up world. Though this isn't a suspensenovel, I was surprised every page, by the delicate and unique emotions of the characters - they were astounded by common things and calm during turbulent events - yet you could understand them. The book brought different blends of emotions to the world of teenage literature. Very much reccomended"
2,Broke after less than a year,"I ordered this brush on September 17th of last year, and it worked just fine - but less than a year later, part of the paddle with the bristles broke off, and that was after only having used it a dozen times at most, AND only having used it on my little Lodge cast iron hibachi, not a full size grill by any means, and simply scraping off normal grill debris (it was while using the scraper on the end that the brush broke). The paddle part where the bristles are is in three sections - the middle section in one piece with the handle, and then the two sides are just glued on, it appears. It was one of those side panels that broke off while I was just using it normally, not being rough with it at all. I have glued it back on, but really not expecting it to hold for long. Can't recommend this brush, unless you like buying a new grill brush each year."
1,I have never seen anything like it - came infested with termites,"I have opened the box, took the brush in my hands and almost dropped it. It was all drilled thru and eaten by the termites, or some other wood-eating bugs! Amazon box was covered with their excrements on the inside. It is not worth returning this item, as it would cost more in spent time to ship it back, so I just sprayed it with pesticide and threw it away. Please be advised not to buy this product."
3,bristles are too thin,I was hoping for something a little more substantial as far as the bristle stiffness is concerned. They are of a very small diameter and don't do a good job of knocking off heavy buildup
2,disconects from socket,This does what I wanted except the cord keeps pulling out of the socket. Then I have to reboot because its PS2. I would use USB except I have installed a four port KVM switch which uses PS2.
2,"""Clinical"" is the adjective of choice here","This is pretty painful to watch. It is more instructional than ""follow along"" in format but that's not why it's painful. The exercises are demonstrated by three or four different individuals, accompanied by a voice-over (slow and droning, unfortunately). Low ""fun"" factor and something I wouldn't watch again. I'd recommend Jennifer Kries' ""Precision Toning"" for an intro to Pilates that's more enjoyable."
1,Do Not buy this video,Not only is it more surreal than anything but its cheaply made. If anything its more of a science fiction exercise video simply because the people are exercising like robots and there is a lady talking to close to a microphone over what you can only imagine is an interplanetary space ship. Pilates is a great way to balance your workout but not in this video attempt.
5,The Most Specific and Accurate Pilates Instruction Available,"I can't tell you how many Pilates classes I have attended where inaccurate or 'no' instructions are given for the exercises. The results can be very frustrating and sometimes even painful. You're right...this is not a 'fun' tape, but no one is shouting at you to 'come on' and 'move it' either. Calm and accurate instructions yield relatively quick results when the progressions are followed repeatedly over a few weeks. I would not trade it for any of my 40 or more other workout tapes. My only wish is that it also came in DVD."
5,Lovely Book!,"Thanks very much, the book was arrived long times ago, however I need my friend brought back to China for me, thats why I cant rate straight after your delivery. A lovely book and in good condition. Thanks again."
4,"Great workout for beginners, low impact","I'm the kind of girl that DOESN'T lke to work out. After coming back from a hiking trip, I decided that I should start work-out. I came across with this series. It's easy to follow, but does make me sweat a lot. I can see my health condition improved a lot just by doing this for 1 week! I like the way that it divides 4-mile walk into 1-mile mini walks. If I don't have time, I'll just do 1-2 miles, I feel great! I like the part that she integrated strength training into the 4th mile. YES...TONING BAND is included! The only reason I give it 4 stars is that...I'm getting bored and annoyed with Leslie's voice and the music. You'll see what I'm talking about. LOLWell, I recommend to those of you who are just like me----super lazy, and want a simple work out that helps..."
2,It's not worth for the money!,The workout is not what it describe I expected it. The band work is very short and basic. The menu section is not working well so can't choose what I wanted. The DVD is poorly made and I don't think it's worth for the money. I liked her 5 Day Walk Plan so I bought this exercise DVD but I am very disappointed.
5,Love It!,"I just received this workout a couple days ago and I've done it twice already! It's a great workout and makes me sweat! I started with Leslie back in July 2007 and could barely do the one mile easy walk. Now I can do ANY of her workouts and I've lost 81 lbs and all I ever do for exercise is Leslie workouts. This one is my new favorite! Believe me, it will get you in shape and I NEVER exercised before Leslie. It's the real deal!"
4,Leslie Sansone 4 Really big Miles,Mile 2 and 3 are fast pace and you are done before you know itI am a runner and use Leslie to cross train. Mile 4 does stretches with a band that is good as well.
5,Favorite Leslie Video!,"I have six of Leslie's walking videos, and this is my favorite one. It is the most advanced of the videos I have, but that is why I love it! I love the lack of talking at the beginning. The video goes straight to the menu to let you choose your workout. You can also choose your workout. From the menu, you can choose which mile(s) you would like to complete. You do get the same chitty-chatty Leslie, but that is part of her workouts. Overall, a very good workout! Get ready to sweat :)"
5,Fast and Firm 4,This is wonderful! I love the lively music and the upbeat attitudes. It is interesting and fun. The time passes quickly.
4,She really kicks your butt!!,"I like her even though she is suppose to be beginner friendly, sometimes I have to pause to catch my breath. LOL Stick with her and you will reach youe goal."
5,Just what I expected,This is an easy to follow program that gets results. I have found this to be effective in toning along with the weight loss I am trying to achieve.
3,ok,"So, I bought this in order to get some cardio in since my gym membership expired. It's a good walk, but it's not 4 miles...Not sure where they get 4 miles. I was wearing a pedometer and it clocked me in at a little over 3 miles. I would not bother with the stretch band they give you. I tried using it with Leslie and she doesn't seem to even know how to use it. It's kind of pathetic. The other walkers are old and some out of shape. I'm sorry it helps when you see fit people working out with you, not old floppy women. That being said, it is an OK cardio program, but very low intensity. Leslie's annoying talking and the camera switching around all the time on these old faces, kind of confusing...turns me off. I will still do this workout, as it's good for home, but it really doesn't burn too many calories and I barely broke a sweat. I will probably switch to less time (30 minutes) and higher intensity cardio. Less time, tougher workout, more efficient."
1,I did not receive this tape,this CD was sent to the wrong address and I have never received it. I have made many attemps to get it sent to the correct address but no luck.
5,Great Workout!,I love this workout!! I started in February of this year and have lost 23 pounds since I started doing this workout about 3 or 4 times a week. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to lose weight.
5,Great motivation,"Leslie always keeps you motivated. This is a great video for the someone who wants to advance in the walking series. You can do 1, 2, 3, or all 4 miles at a time."
5,Love this!,I'm a Leslie fan so my review may be a bit bias but I find myself reaching for this DVD often. Love the music and the format. This gives me a great workout.
4,One of her best,I have at least 25 of Leslie Sansone's Video and DVD. I many of the older out print like walk away the stress the 1 mile for abs etc. I wish she would put those on DVD. This one is one of her best.Yes she talks no stop for almost an hour. She uses her basic 4 steps but it goes by fast. I like the music she uses for her 4 the mile. I wish she would use it more often. I am thankful for Leslie because she gets those of us up and out of the chair. It has been because of Leslie that I have been able to at the Firm into my routine. And I am using the older firm tapes/dvds and they are long.... but thanks to leslie I am keeping up. I will say this about Leslie Sansone I feel like I know her and her walk leaders.
5,You Do Break A Sweat!,"I've seen Leslie's workouts for years and didn't think I would sweat just from walking. Finally decided to give her a try with this DVD. I broke a sweat and actually felt the burn. The workout is more than walking in place. It incorporates kicks, high leg lifts, side steps and rear leg lifts. So, there's variation in the walking. It's a great low-to-moderate workout. Looking forward to working my way up to 4 miles."
5,Has anyone done the 10 workout challenge?,"Tomorrow is #5 of the 10 workout challenge Leslie claims. I feel so much better, but has anyone actully done it and if so, what were the results at the end of the challenge? I love the DVD. It is the best at-home workout I have ever tried. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that Leslie is a bit too chit-chatty, but I haven't found that so annoying I couldn't do the workout. I think she is truly trying to motivate her viewers. The moves are so easy it really is a no-brainer, but so far they seem to be working. I was terribly sore the next day after the first workout, but I went ahead and did the workout again the next day. Now I will be doing my 5th day tomorrow and I am not sore at all. I'd love to have some feedback from others who have done the challenge."
4,The Partisans,"Andy Peabody is a very creative man who has led a fascinating life. Actually several lives. This is reflected in his informative and entertaining book, the Partisans.Larry"
3,The Browns are incredible,"I really enjoyed the first 3 songs on the CD. However, some of the unfamiliar songs were overpowering to me. I must admit that I bought their CD for Rhapsody in Blue which is truly awazing. I listen to it over and over."
2,A bit dissapointing,"I guess I was expecting more of a Ferrante and Teicher thing with more than one piano going at a time ... could be that it is but, if so, am missing depth ... great family but disappointing album"
4,guerilla prose,"A transitional keywork. Displaying the themes and techniques of his early work and showing mastership in them. Giving glimpses of the things to come, like more narration and further development of the 'language is a virus' theory, but not yet integrating them fluently and a little too political so that the exaggeration and satire lack sometimes the multidimensional and selfundermining force he is so capable of employing. Besides that, the voice, that singing quality of his, is not always heard in this maybe too well wrought book. The spontainity of Naked Lunch is traded for exercise like experiments. Yet he saves the day with gargantuesk displays of the rich elite and fearsome scenes of the well deserved guerilla imposed on them by the Wild Boys. Unhealthy creatures though."
2,This book sucks,"The quality of the copy was fine, this is just a dumb book, I'm very disappointed. Glad i didn't buy new"
3,Not So Simple Knits!,"I am a beginning knitter, and was expecting some very simple patterns without the increasing and decreasing, cable stitches, button holes and many of the other techniques called for by the patterns in this book. What Ms Mackin considered beginner level projects I would consider at least intermediate. Most of the patterns are for sweaters and coats, although there are a couple of patterns for poncho-type garments that seem to be fairly simple. The photographs are lovely and the garments are ones I would wear, but the book will be put away until I have more knitting experience."
3,IMO,"For the price these strings are better than the usual student strings, and I am told that two primere/famous violinists use these. Anyway, They do give a good sound and a near descent feel but they die to quickly! Six weeks, maybe two months.... For the price, having to buy these every six weeks? Might as well buy Obligato, or any other upper echelon strings. At least they would last longer."
1,Color Description is Misleading,"The color described as ""linen"" is actually brown. I don't know why they don't say that it is brown; they say that the blue one is blue and that the natural one is undyed. There is no photograph shown of the item, so that customers can see that the color of the blanket is brown."
1,CONTAINS FLOURIDE,"Bought the 3 pack and looked at entire description and no where did it say it has flouride added.On package it says ""contains 1000ppm max of flouride when packed. Foaming Flouridated toothpaste""Returning these."
4,Good Primer,"This book is a valuable addition to anyone's library that is already well versed in astrology and a good primer for students of business cycles. Handy tools including a useful questionaire for clients are included as part of the book. This one book will allow you to learn when to sell a property, open a business or evaluate the current cycle in an existing business. Written in an easy to understand style, the author covers stock markets, industry cycles and basic astrological business precepts. A must have. The case studies sum up the previous chapters and the appendices should be xeroxed and tacked up for easy reference. The perfect cheat sheets!"
2,nothing that cannot be found free on the internet,I bought this book in order to understand more about the connection between business and astrology after several years of learning astrology but I did not find it in this book.
3,Does not fit 5838,"I read somewhere that this paddle would fit an Oster 5838. It does not! So the paddle is worthless for me, but otherwise there is nothing wrong with it."
5,Breadmaker paddle,This is a replacement part exactly like the one that came with the bread machine. It worked perfectly when I used it to make bread.
1,fit in to Sumbean 5891,"Did the research be4 purchase this paddle. it did say this is right part # for my Sunbeam 5891 , BUT IT DOES NOT FIT IN .It is too big. Now I don't know what to do . It's cheap enough to keep it and wash my money away but I need the right part anyone know where /which get the right paddle for my sunbeam 5891?Update : so since I can't really find the part anywhere , i decided to order 2nd one again cuz the first one i received was not same as picture showing , It works this time it fits in my sunbeam 5891 . I guess they just sent me the wrong part at first time . But I still give 1 star cuz they didn't send me the right part i ordered 1st time and had to sending double money on it."
5,This is the wrong one for my bread machine,"There must be a better way to buy these parts. The cross referencing available on the web gets the parts muddled up. There appears to be six or so machines innards marketed by 30 brands/models.We bought our machine at a yard sale, where that homeowner could not find this essential part. This one would have to be drilled out in order to work properly. The cost of return is almost what I paid, so it's a loss.Service by this seller was excellent, and not his fault that -- what I personally thought would work, simply did not."
5,I like this product,"The paddle for Sunbeam Oster 113494-001-000 Breadmaker is well suitable for Sunbeam 5891. It came on time and work perfect. The original one I used 4 years, but it start loosing its covering layer and the bread glued to it."
2,Worth reading if you're a PC user..,"There is some good information in this book if you're using a PC. And, honestly as a Mac user, I did find some resources that I was unaware of. That said, I found the author's condesending tone and obvious PC-bias annoying. At his worst, he shows that he is totally uninformed about the best Mac tools for podcasting.He has a very simple paradigm for podcasting, one that he does not deviate from -- and I have no doubt his recipe works. However, it would be helpful, in order to understand podcasting more broadly, to venture outside of his approach. I would also point out that much of this information, with release of iTunes 4.9 is either out of date, (not the authors fault) or incomplete. Two stars at best. Wait for it to show up in the bargin section of your local mega book store."
1,Just an Overview. . .,"I got this book since it was touted as the first podcasting book. I can now see why it was the first. I got the feeling it was a rushed production from page 2 on. It just touches on programs and other info in later chapters. Plus there are full page pictures of a microphone and other pointless things to take up space. The book if you were to remove the giant sized pictures would be less than 100 pages of actual information. . .if that. I could go on, but you get the idea. Yes, it's the ""first podcasting book"" but that is about all it is. I'm sure others will be better and more informative. . ."
3,"Unfortunately, out of date...","The tough thing about tech books is that they are out-of-date as soon as they make it to print. While this book gives a great overview of the origins of podcasting and the different technologies that lie behind the craze, it's almost a history book now. With the advent of GarageBand (which isn't even mentioned in the book) and free podcast hosting sites, information about the ins and outs and nuts and bolts of RSS and FTP upload sites is woefully archaic -- and unnecessary.Still, it's a great overview for the geeks out there who want to know everything from the ground-up. And Cochrane's writing is entertaining, light, and self-deprecating. I look forward to an updated version soon."
3,Mac bias and early publication date are problems today,"As noted in many of the other reviews, this was the first podcasting book to hit the market. So, especially as it relates to iTunes it is very out of date. I too found the anti-Mac bias to be a detriment, not just because I'm a Mac user but because 25-35% of all podcasters use Macs.The book is really good at getting people enthused about jumping into the medium and there are good tips on getting sponsors. It's nice that the book has such a personal touch as well.I'm looking forward to the next edition but for now Podcast Solutions is the gold standard for podcasting books."
4,Solid information easily understood and well told,"I'm new to the world of podcasting. So I bought this book because it looked interesting.I've been reading through it and, frankly, I'm feeling overwhelmed by it all. I'm sure podcasting is easy once one gets started. But it's the getting started that I find tedious and time consuming. But I'll keep at it.Todd's book is well written, easy to follow, and contains a wealth of information.I'm a total podcast newbie. I can't vouch for all of the technical content of the book, nor did I pick up on the author's supposed PC-bias. I'm a Mac user myself and I found his information helpful.If you're interested in learning about podcasting, I recommend this book. It's a great place to start and a solid resource."
4,Podcasting: Do It Yourself Guide,"A very good book but a little too involved. Very small print. Lots of information. Maybe once I get my feet wet then things will make sense. Too much information for a rank beginner. Take this into consideration when purchasing this book. Is well put together though.Podcasting,"
2,Outdated as of March 2006,"Probably was on the money back in the day, but 50% of the content is obsolete with the newer technology today."
2,geekiness is no substitute for knowledge,"Todd Cochrane freely admits to being a part-timer and pioneer; this is how most technology has become assimilated into everyday life. Todd might have done better to have hooked-up with someone who could show him the ropes about audio. His knowledge and tips regarding sound recording are, largely to be ignored. This is not to say that Todd's book is a waste of time, as audio is only one - albeit a critical one - aspect of podcasting. The book is approachable and does have some interesting advice and Todd shares his enthusiasm well. My caveat is: if he can make such fundamental errors in a well-established technology such as audio can the rest be trusted? The moral is: read the book and ask a friend."
5,Solid book for even existing podcasters,"I've been podcasting for a while, so some of the intro chapters were a little basic for me. (Of course, they were absolutely perfect for newbies. Can't say enough about how much I wish this book existed late last year when I started my communityguy.com podcast!)But where the book really shines for me in about halfway through when it starts to get into some of the discussion about issues that every podcaster hears about, but never really gets a good answer to. Stuff like ""Do I need a mixer? What is a mixer even for, anyway??""Great job to the author on this spectacular book.The best thing about it is that in two nights of casual reading I was able to breeze through it - the true mark of a great technology book!"
2,Good for a limited purpose,"If your intention is to podcast to a public site, this is a good book, with clear instruction. If you want to set up podcasts from your own website,there is nothing in this book to help you, and you would be wasting your money, as I did. The book does not live up to its title.The author assumes that you are a public blogger wanting to post podcasts on a public site. There is nothing anywhere in the release about the book that this book is no help, if you want to post on your own website. Next time, I guess I go to a bookstore and look at the book. Anyone want a very slightly worn, but unused, copy of this book?"
1,Poor audio on this radio,"I've tried a few different FRS radios. I found this Kenwood model to have poor audio -- very muffled tones. No good! The whole purpose of a radio is to communicate, and it gets burdensome if you have to keep saying ""What?"" ""What did you say?"""
3,Refactoring misunderstood,"While prefactoring is a cute name, refactoring refers to continuous improvement of code, facilitated by unit tests, not stopping a project to do a redesign. The fundamental principle is producing code that is easy to change, because attempting to get it right the first time often prevents getting it right at all."
3,Well written with sound advice for a beginner,"I was attracted to this book by the title: 'refactoring' and the agile development philosophy are sometimes used as an excuse for insufficent design. So I liked the explicit emphasis on the need to get stuff right the first time.Ken Pugh writes with an engaging style that is very easy to read and makes sound suggestions. It would be a valuable guide for new developers looking to broaden their horizons from tools and code. However, there is not a lot that is new in this book and the principles are somewhat introductory for a more experienced programmer. 'Journeymen' programmers would be better served by the Practice of Programming by Kernighan and Pike, or by the Pragmatic Programmet by Hunt and Thomas."
1,TALIMENA SCENIC BYWAY 1star for poor video and apathy,"Length:: 3:54 MinsIMHO - IT's, Mind numbing your ears will bleed and your eye's will cross it's like having a migraine headache. You will never be the same again... The video I streamed here and found the website has clips I watched on 10/25/11 [...] you can see clip's there of what his vid's are like before you buy or stream this..."
2,Boring and repetitive...,"Nothing beneficial, entertaining, or helpful... I expected; local information, recommendations and certainly more actual coverage of the ""bike"" not impressed..."
1,Not as pictured - take care!,Had to send these items back. The pictures are not representative of the product - they were shaped quite differently. Take care!
5,Powerful!,"Very powerful amp. Lots of amp models to choose from. What can be said that hasn't been said before by other reviewers? Yeah, it's not a tube amp, but come on, for the price they're selling this thing, it's a steal."
5,"easy to read, just enough math to keep it complicated","I have not finished this book, but I have learned so much about airplane wings, tails, propellers, winglets, fins, drag, lift, thrust. Lots of graphs, diagrams, pictures (showing drag & lift), to help illustrate airplane flying concepts. How wings actually work.I think the best description for me, for why the curved upper wing surface creates lift is simply, the air molecules are farther apart on the upper surface, and thus the pressure is lower on the top of the wing, and greater on the lower surface of the wing. Thus the wing is ""lifted"" upwards. That is why, if the air does not stay with the upper and lower wing surface, the wing stalls. Since the air pressure is really the same on the top surface and the lower surface, when the air is not flowing over the wing properly. Therefore the wing (airplane) will drop since the air pressure is the same on the top and bottom surface."
4,"Excellent simplified text on the topic, no maths.",A very easy to read & understand text which introduces High Speed & Hypersonic flight concepts in an easily digested form. No mathematics background needed. an excellent introductory text but nowhere near as comprehensive or detailed as the Darrol Stinton books
5,Very Satisfied,I am completely satisfied with this transaction and I saved about 250.00 from what the bulb is through in focus.No issues what so ever and delivery was earlier than stated by a day
1,a disappointment,"i'd heard good things about this brand so i was really looking forward to using it. what a disappointment. maybe i got a lemon? it actually warped on its very first use. the product information claims the temperature limit to be 450 degrees but it warped after toasting bread crumbs for 5 minutes in a 400 degree oven. it clinched the one star rating when i washed it out in the sink and towel dried it off - water was dripping on my foot. i looked and it was actually coming from the corner lip at the seam underneath. that ""Aire"" pocket sprung a leak! i would have returned this product had my toddler not made a rocket ship out of the packing materials and receipts."
5,Favorite deodorant,I love the scent and the convenience and price of Amazon's pack of these deodorants is fantastic. I love not having to go to CVS more than necessary.
2,a little dissapointed,"Im new to baking cheesecakes and I jumped on buying a springform without doing any research or anything, thought I was getting a deal but wasnt. And this pan is great for water baths, it leaked a little but my cake was still edible because i used foil."
5,Who would Have Thought?,Who would have thought that sitcom stars could be such talented singers!This cd has become a personal favourite of mine with its mix of nostalgic and lively Christmas songs.
4,Criminal Investigation,"I recieved the text book fairly quickly. The book was in descent condition, with the exception of some markings inside, all the pages and hard cover was in tact. I am in college, and this is my third time purchasing a book with Amazon, I am satisfied with their customer service and services."
1,"Says one thing, does the other....","I waited over two weeks, was bounced back and forth between dates of receiving this textbook, and STILL do not have either the book OR my money returned to my account yet. I advise everyone to do business with other fine individuals on Amazon.com but NOT this seller. Buyer beware!!!"
5,Finally a ladle!,"Ladle is bigger than I thought it would be. It's a little bulky, but does a great job. Love that's it's silicone."
2,"floppy, sloppy, and a weird angle","This ladle doesn't deserve the high rating that others give it. First off, it's huge, and due to the curvature of the handle/extension and the size/thickness of the bottom, it takes a disproportionate amount of space in your utensil bucket. Beyond that, it's not firm enough to really dig in and hold a full serving of thick chili, so I recommend looking elsewhere."
2,Silicone Ladle,"I was disapointed of it's bulkiness,it should be thiner and easier to use. The handle is so fat that my finger hadly go around it. I don't use it at all. I hate it when I shop wrong thing."
1,Speed change in the wrong direction,"I have a Dell Inspiron 500M and I am looking for a dramatic increase in LAN speed, mainly for backup and replication purposes. I was hoping for 10 times faster (100MB to 1GB), but got 10 times slower.As other reviewers are having the same problem with other cards I wonder if there are limitations in the notebook or Cardbus architectures. My past experience with D-Link products have been generally good."
4,1962 - All About Our Music,"I think those who are critical of the music of this era should lighten up a bit. This album particularly demonstrates the incredible diversity of the musical palate. Sue Thompson's ""Norman"" is a really hummable, polka-type, toe tapping song. Kenny Ball's ""Midnight in Moscow"" has a distinctive dixieland flair yet sonehow manages to invoke images of Moscow indeed. While I certainly am a big Connie Francis fan, her entry in this collection is argueably somewhat mediocre. The innovative foot stomping beginning to ""Sherry"" by the Four Seasons compliments the falsetto voice of Frankie Vali. I think those of us who grew up in the 60's were really spoiled by the incredible mix of our popular music. Sure, it's not Gershwin but then again at least it's not Snoop Doggy Dog."
5,Outstanding performances,"This is an absolutely wonderful set of recordings. The Missa Solemnis is outstanding, the Choral Fantasy has the crispness of a live recording, and the work by Haydn lacks nothing. This two-CD set is one of my favorites."
3,Making Sense of the Senseless,"Professor Megill does a good job with Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault, but less so with Derrida, I think. For the new reader this book is not their best introduction, but if you kind of know the stories already, the book is readable and pretty entertaining.Stylistically, Megill uses many of the same words and phrases over and over (example: toward the end I was cringing every time I came across the word 'corpus'), and the author tends to come across as, perhaps, a bit to highbrow for my liking, but obviously he knows the material well.I give him a lot of credit trying to deal with writers who tend to defy understanding."
2,Decent,"Pretty well made, but a little small (uncomfortable for your rear after about 10-15 minutes). Also, I bought two, and one of the screws on one of them (under the seat) keeps falling off... I think I'll need to glue it back in, because it's stripped (even though I never messed with it). I would recommend another chair, but I haven't tried many others... I hope they get a lot better than this."
2,CONFUSED,"I RECENTLY PURCHED A MEET THERMOMETER MODEL #17003. I AM CONFUSED AS TO IF I CAN PUT THIS IN THE MEET I AM COOKING IN THE OVEN. THE PACKAGE IT CAME IN DID NOT SAY EITHER WAY, BUT HAS LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT I CAN. WILL YOU PLEASE LET ME KNOW BEFORE I DESTROY MY NEW MEAT THERMOMETER.THANK YOU, TAMMY JUSTICE"
5,You can't go wrong with these!,"We had VCR tapes of this CD plus the 1950-54 Billboard CD, among others. Unfortunately, the VCR no longer plays and the tapes are so worn out . . .This music really takes you back to your youth. They don't write songs like these anymore.The recordings are clearly mastered and sound great.Billboard Pop Memories: 1955-1959"
4,A Brief But Pleasant Look Back,"As per usual, this ten-song compilation is over too quickly, but hey, it keeps the price down. All number one songs on this collection (with five years to choose from, they had BETTER find enough number ones!), with many highlights. ""Sleep Walk"" and ""It's All in the Game"" remain two of my favorite songs from this time period. ""Moonglow/Theme from Picnic"" and ""Cherry Pink..."" are two good instrumentals. However, they could have chucked ""Unchained Melody"" - not interesting enough. I'm not a big fan of ""Love Letters in the Sand"" either, but its inclusion is understandable. A very good collection for relaxing."
2,"Was the worst ""DVR"" ever, but now its just bad.","I agree with most of the posts here about the garbage that is the HR20, but it has improved greatly since October. Nevertheless, it si so unreliable that I had to get DirecTV to re-connect my 5 year old TiVo (for free) to catch all the programs this thing misses. They have sent out numerous updates, but it seems that they are spending more time enabling features to make the thing appear to be better than TiVo rather than addressing basic recording (that's what a DVR is for right?). It is like a high end car with an awesome stereo, and brakes that don't work. I nearly left DirecTV over this thing, and I've been with them since 1995!"
1,JUNK,"I have used Directtv for over 10 years and have been satisfied for the most part. But with this new HR-20 HD DVR Receiver, I find that I have a piece of JUNK. I am on my third receiver and I still have the same problems of LOCK UP and have to push the red button. This causes a complete reboot and then have to wait for all the programming to download again. JUNK!"
1,BIG MISTAKE !!!!,"I have used Directtv for over 10 years and have been satisfied for the most part. But with this new HR-20 HD DVR Receiver, I find that I have a piece of JUNK. I am on my third receiver and I still have the same problems of LOCK UP and have to push the red button. This causes a complete reboot and then have to wait for all the programming to download again. JUNK!"
1,Robbed,"A petition needs started for a class action suit against Directv for this piece of junk they call HR-20 HD DVR.Almost daily I have to hit the red reset button because:A) There is no picture on any channelB) The remote quits workingC) Channels just disappear from the available channels menuAnd yes, it is quite slow changing channels."
1,All bad reviews are right,"All the bad reviews I've read here are correct. I'm writing a piece comparing the Warner Cable and DirecTV programming and how the difference is like night and day! The DirecTV remote is also extremely slow, and there are several more layers to the programming before you can get to where you want to go. If two programs overlap, there's no way you can compromise to record one partially. With Time Warner's programming, you can specify one to record a shorter length to accommodate the other for full recording, or vice-versa. With DirecTV, it's all-or-nothing! Their equipment and service are the absolute worst. Any move you make with DirecTV, they will EXTEND your contract! I'm only waiting for my contract to expire so I can cancel them. In the meantime, I'm just holding tight."
1,DirecTV must hate it's customers,"I, like almost everyone else who's rated this product, wish I could give it 0 stars. I replaced an HR10-250 with this ""upgrade"" and I couldn't be more unhappy. This unit does not buffer programs if you change the channel, there is no way to change tuners manualy, it only records about 1/2 the series you have it programed to record, it can't tell the difference between first run and re-run (and it often records everything EXCEPT first run even when set to record both) you can't program it to record only at a certain time, there are too many problems with this unit to name them all. Don't accept this unit, and if you have one already return it to DirecTV and tell them to make one that works or you'll go to Dish network. Don't allow them to pawn this inferior piece of junk off on their paying customers. We deserve better."
3,Not as bad as you might think,"I bought and had this unit installed 2 weeks ago. We have had no lockups, and all works OK. Picture is BEAUTIFUL. The only complaint is that compared to true TIVO software, the DirectTV software is clunky and cumbersome. If TIVO feels like a 5th generation product, this product feels like a 2nd generation product. The reality is that when it comes to DVR's for HDTV there are only 2 choices if you want to record more than 10 or 15 hours of HD programming: A true TIVO product (which requires a cash outlay of $800 with which you have to go with Cable with it's limited number of HD Channels, or this product (with LOTS of HD channels), which needs a LOT of work to get it to feel as slick and smooth as a TIVO product. I have no regrets about this purchase given my options, but if something comes out that is better, I will immediately switch."
1,Locks up,"Just as others have posted, it locks up 3-5 times a week. We have had this unit for 3 months and even had a couple service calls where they tried to charge us $70 to fix this piece of junk. Make sure you pay for the warranty plan if you own the HDDVR. Kind of amazing that you need to buy the warranty plan because of poor quality."
1,is this thing on?,"this is the worst box i have ever had and believe me with that huge cable box i didn't think it could get worse. that is until this awful dvr. i loved my tivo and thought this would be a wonderful addition to my peaceful tivo obsessed coach potato existence. boy was i wrong. the remote never works. first, the dvr would randomly shut off and reset. direct tv sent someone out. no luck! they gave me a new box. after 2 weeks, it doesn't respond to the remote. called up direct tv, they sent me a replacement remote. long story short i now have 3 remotes that do not control my dvr. i have been forced to get up and channel the box myself. this box is the WORST!!!"
2,NOT AN HR20 THEY ARE SELLING,"IF YOU ARE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT AND EXPECT TO BE SENT THE ITEM SHOWN IN THE PICTURE DON""T BE FOOLED, THEY WILL SEND YOU AN HR21 WHICH IS BLACK AND WHILE IT IS A NEWER UNIT DOES NOT HAVE OFF AIR ANTENNA INPUT ANYMORE!! I ORDERED THIS THINKING IT WAS GOING TO BE AN HR20..."
1,First time rater,"While having read the reviews for many products on Amazon to help me decide on a purchase, I have never written one. I feel like I must submit one, now, for this product. The quality is poor. If there is a competing hd dvr out there that can be used with Directv, I would recommend that one. It can't be any worse. Having had Tivo (and still do), this dvr is horrible in comparison. It frequently is unresponsive and the controls and menus are clunky. There are even times when you press a button once and the receiver thinks you've pressed it multiple times (e.g. hit ""0"" once and ""00"" or ""000"" pops up). How can a receiver be unresponsive one minute and then overly responsive the next?! It is so bad that I am contemplating dropping Directv and going back to cable. Yes, I said it. I never thought I would consider subscribing to cable again until this dvr came into my life."
3,"Correct Political Argument, Excess Ideology","I agree with Patterson's opposition to the death penalty. His argument would have been just as legitimate without demonizing those who disagree. Prosecutors, non-liberal judges, and victim families are not all heartless automatons. Patterson's arguments against the death penalty and the failings of American justice in implementing capital punishment are articulate and thorough. His constant demeaning of the prosecutor, judges, and American citizens who support capital punishment as unthinking ideologues limits his work to providing music to the anti-capital punishment choir, but will immediately offend others who might be swayed to his opinion."
3,He's just getting too damned liberal,"I liked Patterson's earl;y books, but he just seems to be doing his research from his office. It's almost like he has started on campaigns for liberal causes. I wish he's just stick to entertaining us and get off his soap box."
1,What A Stinker,"What A StinkerReviewer: Paul Haines from Toronto, Ontario CanadaUp until the last few pages, I would have rated this novel as 5 stars. Patterson had very well defined characters and an exceptional knowledge of Death Penalty Law at all court levels, including the United States Supreme Court. The novel is about a truly innocent man who, in the last 5 pages, dies by lethal injection. How crummy can you get?"
3,Very technical,"The plot line was very similar to John Grisham's The Chamber, only this book was much more technical - lots more legal jargon. I had to skim parts because I was getting bored trying to wade through all of it. And speaking of legal jargon, the main female character was explaining legal concepts to her stepson that he should have learned on day one of law school! I realize that is the author's ""tool"" to explain those concepts to the reader, but it was hard for me to think it was credible that the character would not already know those things. I also think this book may be part of a series? I feel like I was missing lots of backstory and character development. But I don't know, So, it was good, but The Chamber was definately a more suspensful and character driven book."
4,Executed Well!,"I am not a big fan of death row books. Every legal thriller author seems to have to write one of two of these books. Grisham's are among the worst.This book may be an exception to my rule, as it is enjoyable to read. The characters are well developed, the story told in a nice investigative way, and the finish is done well.Overall, an enjoyable book in a not-too-enjoyable genre."
4,A good read,"This book by Patterson is a book that is written to your heart. If you can read it without crying or at least finding a tear running down your cheek, you would be unusual. You can be hardened by our criminal system, which is probably the best it can be, but can it make mistakes? This book makes you think of the possible injustices of our criminal and penal systems. A penetrating look at what can happen that is injust and why it can happen, even in our system of justice. A good read.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the'Isms'"""
5,Great Read!,I discovered this author when I read The Race and had to have more. All of his books are a great read!
2,SLO MO,"I had just finished an exciting Harlen Coben book before starting this one. In contrast, this went into slow motion in part 2. It starts well, and then gives the reader the flavor of endless legal theories, documents and arguments. If you have ever read legal papers you will recognize the emphasis on process over truth and fairness. The initial proposition gets dragged out over too long a time.The reality of a jaded judiciary is truer than most of us would like to think. Unfortunately the point is made all too slowly. Renell's last days go more slowly for us than for him."
3,An author's struggle,"Richard North Patterson has given us at least three great novels: Protect and Defend, No Safe Place and Caroline Masters. I suppose it was too much to expect a fourth in the form of a novel in which the primary focus is on the complexities, emotions and injustices of the death penality and its legal morasses as it is carried out in this country. I have read five of Patterson's novels, though I am not much of a fiction reader in my old age, prefering ""faction"" in my dotage. But unlike one of the previous reviewers, I find the actions and motivations of the Justice Scalia character, identified as Justice Fini in the novel, completely credible. This is a difficult book, in many senses. I suspect unless you have an overwhelming facscination with the marvels of the death penality, that most readers, even those like me who have serious reservations about the death penalty as it is carried out in this country, will find it unsatisfying. William F Harrison"
2,Hard read,"""Conviction"" is fine if you are into every detail of courtroom procedure. There are several levels of court this book wanders through, and it left my mind wandering. There was just too much legal procedure and not enough plot for my taste. RNP has better books out there."
2,FIZZLE,After reading all of Mr. Patterson's novels I was extermely disappointed in his latest - Conviction. The story started off very intersting but it came to a slow middle and boring end. It is hard to believe that this book was written entirely by him.
2,Let me hold you longer,"I love Karen Kingsbury but I did not care for this book. For one thing I bought it for my grandaughter and it seemed to be geared more towards a boy, which needs to be expressed. I was disappointed in this one."
2,Not for the breastfeeding / non-religious,"I was looking for a special book for my son's first birthday and as excited when I saw this one as it seemed a perfect way to celebrate his changes. Unfortunately when I got it a few lines really turned me off and I'll be returning it. They are:""The last time that I held a bottle to your baby lips"" - We breastfeed and my son has never had a bottle and never will.""The last time that I pray with you and tuck you in at night"" - We're just not the praying type..."
5,Endearing,"I can not tell you how beautiful and wonderful this book is, and how it changed my perspective on holding on to the last moments of your children. Every day is a celebration, life goes way to fast, but if you hold on to every moment as if it were the last your life is more enriched and full."
5,Let Me Hold You Longer,"This is a great book! Karen Kingsbury touches your heart in this book. It makes you literally want to ""hold your children longer"", because they grow up too fast."
5,Let Me Hold You Longer,"This is a great book. It really is a good, read if you have a son. My son is 16yrs. old & I read it to him. It will make you cry! Loved it!"
5,Don't miss this one!,"As a mother of six, Karen Kingsbury knows mommy moments. Let Me Hold You Longer is a children's book chronicling many of those moments. This is my first kid's book review, and I am excited to share what a beautiful book this is! I remember when I read the Redemption series by Kingsbury there was a poem in one that the mother character (Elizabeth) wrote to her son (Luke) for his wedding. I had to read it to my husband because it deeply touched me. Well, Let Me Hold You Longer is an adaption of that poem in picture book format, and I love it. It is a tender reminder to treasure your child's every day moments because all too soon those moments will change. This book would make the perfect baby shower, mother's day, or even high school graduation gift. I recommend it for all parents and grandparents. You'll want to share it with your children and your children's children.[...]"
5,Recommended book!,"This book was recommended to me as a parent, and I think it is an important reminder to love every moment, you never know when it will be your last."
4,Great book - this one is smaller than I expected,"I love this book. Somebody gave it to me when I was pregnant with my first child. I just ordered this one for a friend. It's great, and good quality and everything, but it is a small version than the one that I have. It's more square than rectangular - it's not a big deal, but I didn't notice it in the description and I don't think it looks quite as nice for a gift. . ."
4,Nice as a gift book,"I bought this book as a ""graduation"" gift for a mom who's last child graduated from kindergarten. It is perfect for that kind of thing. I wish their were two families illustrated in the book so there would be a boy and a girl, but that's my only complaint."
5,Let me Hold You Longer,"This book is unbelievable! I have been reading Karen Kingsbury for years and I love everything she's ever written. This book however has special meaning to me because I became a grandma this year. I read this book to my daughter, when her daughter (my granddaughter) was 6 months old. My daughter sobbed! I purchased this book for a friend who was having her first child. This is a great gift for many occasions. Baby showers, you own childs graduation, marriage, first child....LOVED this book! I'm not a crier....this one made me cry!"
5,Let Me Hold You Longer,This is a great book. Talks about children growing up so fast. I plan on giving to my children when they have kids. Book was delivered fast and no issues with mailing. Sweet story.
5,Let me hold you longer,"What a great book! Not just for kids, my adult children loved it as well. Tears in our eyes, so touching! Every child's library should include this one!"
4,Who can resist?,"You have to assume that anyone who buys this is already converted. You won't make kids understand the good old days with dodgy, grainy video, so the music really has to deliver. Unfortunately, the audio quality ain't much better than the video. But the performances? Another story.Even with lip-synched appearances, there's a massive energy flow throughout the disc that separates the rockers from the lounge lizards. Result: about half of this is essential viewing (Personal highlight: Joe and Eddie doing Dylan. Personal weird moment, but still a highlight: The Hullaballoos. Loved 'em then. Now they really look scary!)Sixties fans, get all three Hullaballoo DVDs. Utterly fabulous."
4,A Story Within History,"Jonah Hook comes to the great plains to fight Indians as a ""galvanized Yankee"". His wife & sons were taken by an army of Danites. His search will take years. My only complaint is Johnston's overuse of similes. You get to learn the history of the Plains while reading a good story."
4,Monkey see- -monkey do,"This book describes the antics of a pet monkey named Mo who is invited for lunch on a fancy ocean liner. The monkey is admonished in the invitation to act like a gentlemen. He tries to, but unfortunately, the gentleman he decides to imitate is not a very well-behaved man, since he makes a habit of walking on railings and such. As a result of his poor choice of role model, Mo gets a tongue lashing, but then his hero falls overboard, Mo saves him, and is declared a real gentleman. Despite the tension of misbehavior, scolding, and a fall into the ocean, many kids love the humor of Mo's antics, and of course, there is a happy ending. The book contains about 300 words."
5,flag football,my son is on a flag football team & always wants to play at home so when i saw this i knew we had to have it!! we have all enjoyed playing with him & when his friends come over there's flags for everyone!!! great price too!!
1,Lies...,"I encourage everyone to read all the reviews from all the products from this seller. He (or she) is intentionally ripping off his (or her) customers by sending them the wrong items. I ordered this higher priced set of flags(24.99) as opposed to the cheaper 10-man set (17.99) specifically because it came with the 6 large cones and the mesh bag and the rulebook. This seller tried to dupe me by sending me the one with the 4 cones that fit into the palm of my hand. Don't waste your time, effort, or money on this seller! When I emailed them with this complaint, they said ""we do apologize for this error. we only have the model that you received."" Weird right? I wonder why they would even advertise that they carry this model when they actually don't. Sounds like a well-working scam to me!SKLZ 10 Man Flag Football New DELUXE Set"
4,Tristano was a jazz genius,"Mixed in with many of the more well known jazz musicians were some wonderful musicians that other musicians knew and loved, but the general public knew little about. Unfortunately, Tristano was one of these. A brilliant composer and pianst, his body of music is often hard for the average listener to access, since it didn't always follow along ""traditional"" lines. I always thought of Tristano as the technically magnificent Monk, but that sells both musicians short. Tristano was his own man, and the music that poured out from him was challenging, but always brilliant. It is a crime against nature and Tristano that the recording company left ""C Minor Complex"" off of this CD, though. Obviously, whoever made this CD knew very little about the music."
5,A great intro to Tristano,"What a curious CD this is. I purchased it because I had always heard of Tristano, that he was someone every jazz fan shold know of -- but tracking his sound down wasn't always so easy. This CD gives you two LPs put together, and there's a fascinating double-ness to it.Tristano's solo pieces are impassioned, manic, anticipating Keith Jarrett and many others by a decade or more. Really, you listen to the cavalcade of notes pouring forth from the speaker and you think, 'How the heck can he play all that?'Then there are the group sets, with Lee Konitz on sax, and these are so much more melodic, restful, relaxed...hard to believe the same pianist is at work on both styles. (The group sets were recorded live at a now-long-gone lounge, and you hear the tinkle of glasses in the background, something I always enjoy in live recordings, for some reason.)Anyhow, this is well worth buying and listening to."
4,"difficult, but excellent jazz","Immortalized in Jack Kerouac's On the Road, this CD features Lennie Tristano in a variety of settings. If Bill Evans is the most colorful piano player jazz has ever produced, then Tristano is certainly the most ""black and white"", as his playing focuses on technique and composition rather than feeling. This takes a little bit of getting used to, even if you're a jazz fan; his playing at first might seem a little clunky and off-kilter, but it defintiely uncovers new rewards with each listen. In my opinion the only drawback is the live recordings, which, despite the prescence of the excellent Lee Konitz, aren't quite as special as the rest."
5,Electric Car Blanket,Service was fantastic! Received extremely quick and blanket works wonderfully. Super for those extremely cold nights when I'm delivering papers.
3,heated blanket,"I bought this for my dogs for our cold Wisconsin winters. It doesn't get very warm, i would have to say it gets to be as warm as body temp. My dogs love it!Unfortunatly it doesn't stay plugged in very well, i have to play with it and it still will turn off. Also the cover is not removable."
1,Very Disappointed,"The reviews on this item looked good, so I ordered this in December as a gift. I tried it in my car, and my sister tried it in hers. It's a nice blanket, but you had to wait about 20 minutes to feel any kind of warmth at all. You could eventually tell that it was on, but it gave off no real heat at all. Buy only if you're looking for just a blanket."
5,Love our blanket,"We love this blanket, I wish it was a bit thicker and finer in the quality but it does the job and what it was intended for a good price. It covers both of our laps across the console and keeps two of us warm. I was surprised it is not washable, other than that its perfect for our needs for now."
1,Bad Blanket,DO NOT BUY! Blanket worked well for the first week. And then part of it started to burn and now the wires have melted inside thew blanket. Returning it!
4,completely respectable for the price,"Takes awhile to heat up, same as any other heating blanket I've ever gotten. It doesn't get very hot, but its a nice toasty warmth. The heater went out in my husband's car and I got this for him to keep him from freezing on the way to work. For only [...] bucks I'd say it was worth it. I just wish it was a little bit bigger. My husband is 6'3"" and it won't cover up his feet. oh well."
4,Gets warm fast,"I live in Park City, UT. In the winter, a morning drive means freezing in the car for 5 minutes until it heats up. This blanket, even when left in the car to freeze overnight, warms up my lap and legs FAST after starting the car.It doesn't get really warm to the touch, just warm enough that if you actually use it as a blanket, it's very effective."
2,great idea,"This is a great idea, but seeing as it is only 12v, it will not be very strong. noting that, I received a defective one, and will give it another shot (I'm sending back the defective one, and and getting a new one)"
2,Not what I wanted,I thought I was getting A blanklet for my bed not my truck!!! They should have said more clear that it was for a vehicle!!!
5,Best thing on a long trip,Loooved this blanket. My husband likes to keep the car cold and this was great on our 1800 mile road trip in December. I definitely recommend it.
5,Polar Fleece,I bought this blanket for a gift for a friend. She just loves it!!!! She carries it everywhere!! I do recommend this blanket to any cold nature person!!!
2,I'm not sure it's safe,"The first time I used it, I pulled out the 12-V plug when I was done with it, and I swear it gave me a shock. I felt it all the way down my arm. I hadn't turned it off, because the button is rather hard to push in. The plug remained rather hot for a while afterward even though I had only had it in for 15 minutes.consCan't wash itCan't adjust temperaturedifficult on/off switchmay have given me a shock when I unplugged ittakes too long to heat upkids couldn't feel warmth of it through coats they had on.prosbig enough to spread across width of minivanlong enough cord to reach the backseat from the front seat lighter."
5,No Shutoff Timer to make you freeze in the middle of the night!,"There are other untis out there that have a 45 minute shutoff timer, and that's good if you want it to shut off at 45 minutes, but if you want to use this as a blanket for keeping warm all night on a spare RV or Marine battery, then this is the one for you..."
1,Waste of money!,"I should have listened to the reviews, this blanket blows. At most, it gets about as warm as a blanket stuck in a dryer for 2 minutes. After 1 use it blew out the fuse in the power supply of my car. Pure garbage."
2,Doorstop for Christmas,"Overall very tedious. His style of wit began to wear and eventually I felt trapped in the wartime bureaucracy of London. Marks had enough material for about 200 pages. Nonetheless, I found something interesting about every 20-30 pages."
2,Save your money. Avoid if you want an introduction,"I agree this is a fascinating subject and has a critical role in both military and politcal history. It is unfortunate, however, that one should have to suffer through this book to appreciate it. Get this man an editor. Monty Python could have made better parody of this self-indulgent bore. I sadly wish there were cliff's notes. Absolutely appropriate for only the hard core crytographic fans. Even intermediates should look elsewhere."
5,Riveting Reading,"I came across Marks' book at the Imperial War Museum in London. I have a fascination of all things World WarII and loved this book. I too devoured during the trans-atlantic flight home. As an American History teacher, I intend to use Mr. Marks book as an introduction to codes during my World War II unit. This is one of the best books I have read since ""The Magicians War"" by David Fisher (it chronicals the effors of Oscar Maskelyne to provide camoflauge for the British Army in Northern Africa)."
5,The love that I have....,"What a terrific book! Till now I had only a vague idea of the work SOE performed during the War but Leo Marks' moving, pointed account of his work made the agents lives and the dangers they faced all the more real to me. He has a canny eye for detail and description and fortunately deals with the complicated nuances of the codes in an uncomplicated way. His humour is always bubbling under the surface even at the most desperate times. Perhaps his biggest triumph is his constant battles with the other departments and his ability to keep going, fuelled always by the constant thought that undercover agents had a an average life span of just 6 weeks. If you ever wanted to get to grips with the machinations of the forces BEHIND the SOE agents who selflessly carved their names with pride, read this book. Simply terrific!"
3,"Partly fills a big gap in the literature, but incompletely.","I quite appreciate the fact that Amazon does not want typos reported in this space, but under the circumstances you might want to bend the rule slightly for the reason given below.Anyone interested in trying the double transposition leading to the code on Page 46 should note that the transposition key of 'ALL THINGS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL' is:1 16 17 23 11 13 19 9 22 4 21 14 10 12 24 2 20 6 5 7 3 26 25 15 8 27 18not:1 16 17 23 11 13 19 9 22 4 21 14 10 12 24 2 20 7 5 6 3 26 25 15 8 27 18With these changes, Message 2 encodes as stated, although there appears to be one error in Message 1.Given the nature of the subject and Mr. Marks's fast reflexes, one might wonder if these are typos in the first place."
4,A brilliant young man plays a pivotal role in WW II,"Leo Marks is a whiz with cryptology, words, anagrams, and people. His persistent and tenacious work getting his ideas and creations past his narrow-minded supervisors is a task as difficult as handling the problems that swarm in and around day-to-day applied Allied cryptology. I couldn't give it five stars because of the overuse of forced and convoluted humor, but I hate to have to give it a four rating because four and a half stars is not a rating available to me."
5,Stunning. A humourous look at the covert warfare of WWII,"Marks writes about his wartime experiences from the point of view of one who is confident of his subject matter. He magages to transmit the great importance of the work of the codebreakers, while also retaining his sense of humour and awareness of the larger picture. I found myself reading faster and faster in an effort to reach the end of the story, and find how the pieces fell into place, while simultaneously trying to extend the pleasure of reading a truly exciting and engaging book. Excellent."
5,Campbell's Low-Sodium Chunky Tomato Soup,This is outstanding. Has the old favorite Campbell flavor but with truly low sodium. Hope Amazon continues to carry it all the time.
2,Average and bordering to the boring side,"This is basically a compilation of Gordon's personal journal. There are definitely real information, but the book is NOT you would call entertaining. Having no photos at all is a big negative to me."
3,Aretha Franklin,"This selection had 16 songs, including Respect and Chain of Fools. Very good introduction to Aretha and her strong voice. I would recommend this CD."
5,QUEEN OF SOUL,"The queen of souls greatest years were clearly between 1968 - 1971. During this considerably short period of time she made some of the most remarkable music in history. Such distinguished soul classics like, RESPECT, CHAIN OF FOOLS and I SAY A LITTLE PRAYER remain as unique and popular as they were when origanlly recorded in this era. This lady has one of the most memroable, uplifting voices in music and its a shame that her work has never surpassed the quality of this period in recent times or enjoyed the commercial success of such other fabulous soul performers such as the divine, DIANA ROSS and WHITNEY HOUSTON. She will always be though the most definitive lady of soul and this collection is evidence of some of the sheer magic she cut during her time with Atalntic Records. Highly recommended!"
4,hurricane smith,"This album brings back so many memories of when i was a kid. My mother ""God rest her soul"" always had music playing in the house. I became a dj for 23 years .I can still sing these songs word for word 37 years later.The obscure swagger of these tunes are awesome."
5,Best amazon purchase I ever made,"I use this all the time, normally forget to turn it off, and still have not even used up the 1st battery. It came with an extra. I never had good luck with instant thermometers before, and the kind you leave in get dirty and unreadable. I admit, I have never dropped it in water, but I have had no trouble and have had it for 2 years."
2,"Great idea. But, is there water in your kitchen?","I thought this was the greatest thermometer ever, until it was very briefly immersed in water (I saw it drop, I picked it up...1-2 seconds, if that?). Dead. New battery...didn't fix it. Careful diagnosis by a small electronics expert; can't fix it. Can't return it. Now, I know not to exposure my appliances to water; but really... this is a pocket thermometer, and it was an instant. Unreturnable.Really. A kitchen tool, a thermometer no less, that can't stand very brief exposure to moisture!"
5,The best digital thermometer ever!,We received our Pyrex Digital Instant Read Thermometer a few days ago and we are delighted with it! We have used it for everything from testing meat on the grill to checking the temperature of frosting and candy. It is simple to use and the plastic cover makes a wonderful holder to keep your hands away from steam and hot liquid.
3,Display Problems,"I have similar problems with the display. It hates moisture. I bought this thermometer for use in homebrewing applications where it is necessary to hold ingredients at precise temperatures for extended periods of time... As soon as the steam rising up from the pot hits the thermometer, the display fades out and you can't read it... remove it from the steam and it works fine, at least for awhile -- but if you keep putting it back in the steam, eventally it will get too moist and you have to wait for it to dry out."
1,Crummy Thermometer,I'm not happy with my purchase of this thermometer. The display was very hard to read and either it is not working or the batteries drain very quickly. I've been able to use it once and now it is not working. I am trying to find the manufacturer so I can write them.
1,Good Idea - But cheaply made,"I ordered this item because my current instant read was a dial type that only went to 220 degrees and I wanted something that I could use for deep frying as well. However the first time that we used the thermometer, the temperature displayed correctly for about 30 sec, and then the display went blank, we turned it off and back on, to no avail, even changed the battery. - Nothing could bring it back to life. I am currently in the process of exchanging this for a new one, I'll post again if we have any additional problems with the new one."
1,did not ever receive it. very disappointed,i never got it. i would like the cd. i have a dance studio and ordered it for one of the songs i'm using. i would appreciate receiving what i've purchased
3,Billboard Top Pop Hits: 1960...,"My favorite on this disc: The Theme From 'A Summer Place' - Percy Faith & His Orchestra - a simply outstanding song from a great movie! Five stars for the song! For the disc, 3 stars overall..."
3,Not One of the Standouts in the Series,"Rhino's Billboard series has some excellent CD's, but this one's pretty spotty. Props for ""I'm Sorry"", ""Mule Skinner Blues"", and ""Everybody's Somebody's Fool"", good tunes all. ""Theme from a Summer Place"" was the biggest hit of the year, so one can't argue its inclusion. ""Mr. Custer"" and ""Itsy Bitsy..."" are rather annoying, but as number one songs, I'll let them slide. But what clod put on ""A Thousand Stars"", one of my least favorite songs of the year...and not a huge hit, either? I'd take ""Alley Oop"" over that one, even. Not a bad selection, but they've done better."
4,"Does the job, but could be longer...","I recently purchased this so I could hook up my new HP printer to my new HP laptop. Unfortunately, the cord isn't as long as I hoped it would be, leaving me to figure out where to perch my notebook when I need to print something (my printer is near my old desktop which is not compatible with the new printer). Had it been long enough (another ten feet would have worked), I could have used my laptop while at my kitchen table. Ah, well..In any case, it is a very ""straightforward"" device and should work with any usb port. Just consider the length if you think you'd like to be a reasonable distance from your printer."
3,Not really handcuffs,"They are a novelty and funny, but they don't stay lock. That may seem like a weird thing, but sometimes I want my handcuffs, no matter how fluffy, to stay locked."
5,Better than others,"I bought two pairs from different vendors just in case one shipment will be late for Halloween. Well, this was the one that missed it, but the quality of these guys are noticeably better. Get these if you can wait."
3,"Okay, but numerous mistakes","Mr. Vossler's task was daunting: list all the variations of John Deere toys that are known to exist, associate nearly 1400 photographs with the individual toy, and set a value range for each item. The value range for most toys is appropriate. Unfortunately, several listings are duplicates and nearly one photograph per page does not match the description. This book needed to be reviewed by one of the many collectors knowledgeable on John Deere toys before being published.I hope Mr. Vossler publishes a second edition in a year or two with corrections, additional pictures, and new listings of items released since this book was published."
2,"It's a ""booklet""","The Saga of H.A.W.Tabor/ From Poverty to Wealth, From Wealth Back to PovertyI really thought I had ordered a BOOK, but what I got was a 42 page ""booklet"". They should have included that bit of information when I ordered it. The ""Saga"" can hardly be covered in 42 pages, some of which are photos. It's a good story but I expected more. I felt ripped offl"
5,Love that Nat,Does romantic ballad singing get any better? Most likely not. There will never be another Nat-period! You are going to play this ALOT.
2,Sequel Rarely better than original,"One of the three Snowy White CDs I purchased. Has some good cuts on it, but arrangements not of as high a quality as the earlier White Flames CD. Snowy's understated style is there, of course, but arrangements not as imaginative and music is little repetitious from cut to cut. Would not buy again if had a chance to do it over."
4,I never thought....,"that I would actually enjoy this cd. I used to make fun of kids for listenin to Escape The Fate. I decided to give it a shot when I first heard ""The Webs We Weave"". It didnt seem that emo, so why the hell not? My friend let me borrow it and I gave it a listen. Despite the fairly emo image and lyrics, these guys can actually rock fairly hard. I'm a metalhead, but this is pretty catchy stuff. Its a guilty pleasuer, but a pleasure none the less. I still vomit a little in my mouth whenever I see one of their music videos though. You have to be open minded to enjoy this."
3,It's ok,"Not a huge fan of these guys. They are a little too androginous for me. There are a few good songs on here, the rest are sub-par. If you have ever seen a picture of this band that says it all. They sound just like they look. But this is typical emo these days. So if you are into the whold tight pants fad you'll love this."
4,This is Definitly His Best Work so far....,"This is Ronnie Radke's best work so far by my standards. The Drug in Me is You album is good, but to me, Dying is Your Latest Fashion is way better. I came in late to the game, and I regret it so much because the Escape the Fate is way better than the now Escape the Fate. Almost every song is my favorite, but my favorite of the favorite is There's No Sympathy For the Dead."
3,Get it if you are on a budget,"These radios work well and are clear, IF they are not turned up too loud. This brings up the big problem with using them in a noisy enviornment, such as a car. Whenever I use them between cars 90% of the conversation is asking to and repeating the intended transmission. So if you are on budget and plan not to use your radios between cars, get this set. Otherwise I recomend the Motorola 5200 (have not used, but assume it works well), or the Motorola 6200 series (Work great, never have to repeat a thing, tonz of features).3 stars because it is so darn cheap"
1,Wrong Item Pictured,"This is NOT a RURP. The pictured item is a Black Diamond Talon. It is a hook, not a piton."
1,the book cover is really pretty,"(My review of ""Geek my ride"")""Very unprofessional"" This is what every un experienced pc wiz and unknowledgeable custom ride street pro has thrown in there brand new bubble chevy on dub quads. If you already know that it takes a regular house plug to plug in a pc, game console or whatever it is you're desire to bring from ""crib"" to ""auto"" (having an inverter is needed). thanks to ""GEEK MY RIDE"" they let you know that. -duh- they also jerry rig glue scissors and tape oh yea lots of fashionable Velcro plus most of there projects lack experience. putting a book together for a geek is clumsily easy these days. and what's even really neat is now ""geek('s) in question"" can tell his or her com padres they've been published. everything in this book can be learned by watching a downtown crack-head (given the chance) putting a computer in a vehicle.my copy is being recycled by now, way of-""the old blue bin""H. Stephen williams, consumer 06'"
2,oil can,"I bought this item thinking it would solve my problem putting oil in the RV...it is more trouble than it is worth...the spring is strong, therefore you can't hold the can and push the thumb thing a ma jig while the container is full of oil without spilling or slopping the oil...do not like the product"
2,Lightweight fare from the sixties,"The redeeming feature of this music is the writing of Michael Gibbs which does show some originality and the title track is a work worth hearing. Otherwise, the music is very much part of the fashionable funk of its day and just does not stand up to repeated listenings. OK as background music at a party but really pretty boring rhythmically, few interesting solos, and clunky melodies. Try Burton's Duster instead."
4,very good intermediate kickboxing,"I do the Firm and Prevention, so I consider myself intermediate. I find the moves on this in line with the others I mentioned. Theres alot of kickboxing, with combo moves and some mild dancing. Her cueing is the best I've seen. You wont go wrong with this one."
3,"A Little Too Focused on the ""Dancie"" side...","The kickboxing part of this workout is excellent - easy to follow but great for getting your heartrate up. However, I personally found the dance moves in it to be distracting and annoying - stuff college age girls would probably have fun doing. I tried to ignore it and just do some classic exercise moves during the dance parts like jogging in place or side steps so that I could just get through the workout, but eventually got tired of hearing the instructor yell out over and over again, ""Come on, girls - touch yourself!!!""I have half a dozen other Crunch workouts that I love and I was really excited to see them release one for kickboxing, but sadly, overall I really found this to be a disappointment. I'd highly recommend someone rent this and try it out before buying it."
2,Disappointing,"Jeanette Jenkins is a favorite of mine, but this workout did not cut it. The warm up was excellent, I felt prepared for an intense workout. Yet I became more and more disappointed as the video went on, as the majority of it was ridiculous dance moves with very little actual kick boxing. I also experienced little cardiovascular benefit. I wear a heart rate monitor and I was barely above 92bpm for the entire workout. My target is between 160bpm and 175bpm. This video may be good for someone who is new to exercise or maybe has a hard time with strenuous workouts, but for someone in good physical condition, it's mostly a waste of time."
3,Not Very Intense,"This workout would be fine for someone new to kickboxing or someone who has reached an intermediate fitness level, but for an advanced level fitness enthusiast such myself, it simply wasn't intense enough. The moves were too slow to get my heart rate up enough for a solid, fat burning workout. I'll stick with Amy Bento's Kickbox Xtreme or her new CIA 2805 for my intense workouts, and save this one for when I'm not feeling my best and want something easy. As an instructor, however, Jeanette Jenkins is fun, energetic, and easy to follow."
2,Not intense like a class,"I was looking for a DVD that had me work as hard as I work in a kickboxing class. This is NOT it! I barely got my heart rate up. I typically LOVE Dancie workout videos, they're my first choice, but I did not appreciate the dance/kickbox mix. Very disappointed. Still looking for a good intense kickbox DVD."
3,Great beginner to intermediate workout,"I just used this DVD for the first time and enjoyed it. I am about 12kg over weight, out of condition (and over 40) and today am quite sore from resistance exercises done yesterday.It got my heart rate up and isn't that hard to follow although I couldn't finish it. Although it wasn't possible to get the moves first time I feel that after another six or so sessions I'll get them mostly right (I don't like lots of fancy steps - and am not good at them). I like the dancy moves but since I have never been to a kick box class I can't make a comparison. Didn't find the instructor annoying like some people did.If you are a beginner and don't have tons of room to spring about, this is a good DVD. Would be a bit better if the music volume was a bit louder. Glad I bought it."
3,so-so,"I have only done this once. I kind of find the instructor to be obnoxious. I also think its a little hard to follow at first. Maybe if I did it more, it would be easier. But I find I really don't want to do this one much. Maybe when I get bored of my other one (I bought the Crunch Yoga Pilates Blend DVD as well and it is my favorite.) I'll try this one again."
2,"If you don't dance, don't bother...","It was frustrating 44 minutes for me. But I endured, since I paid for this DVD!Okay, am I done? Good, I can bring this to Goodwill on my next drop off trip.If you don't enjoy dance DVD or don't get complicated choreograph quickly, then spend your money elsewhere... I thought I can handle kickbox part out of this DVD, but I was wrong. The moves were way too quick and complicated. Jeanette is nice, but she is no Billy Banks (teaching moves, non-stop encouraging, etc.)I didn't care for this DVD at all... I'm sorry."
2,Unhelpful mix of dance and kickboxing,"I'm an experience kickboxer and a fairly experienced dancer. Having said that, I thought that this DVD provided an awkward combination of the two. The dance moves did not blend in well with the kickboxing moves, and if anything, they detracted from the intensity of the workout. What's more, Ms. Jenkins had a certain sassy quality in her instruction that was distracting at best, and frequently annoying.The workout was not very intense either. To my mind, it was pretty much the worst of both worlds. If you're new to exercise or to kickboxing, you'd probably want a straight-up kickboxing workout. If you're more experienced though, then this DVD probably won't do much to raise your heart rate. I'd check out something else."
3,Crunch:Super-Charged Kickbox Party,This DVD is a good workout but for people who haven't taken dance lessons it is challenging. You really have to stop and watch the DVD to get the steps right for some of the dance moves. Not as good as the Pilates Crunch DVD that I purchased.
3,"It is good, I guess...","I have been learning Spanish for over a year now and this book (and the first one) has been the choice of my teacher, so, it is good, I guess...I say that, because, 1- Besides my 501 Spanish Verbs book (which is highly recommended btw) I do not have experience with any other Spanish book to compare it to 2- I do not particularly like the teaching method of the book, especially the very ambiguous concepts about the different verb tenses are not very well explained, but my teacher fills that gap... So this book is not a source to rely on solely, but it is a good supplementary. If you are not a language genius, and do not have any former Spanish education, you will miss on a lot of very important and confusing rules about the Spanish language by relying ""only"" on this book. Nonetheless, it has some nice vocabulary and good exercises, and it has chapters dedicated to all the different tenses in the language and in that sense it is exclusive."
2,Little Value,"Bought the book for an introductory conversational Spanish course. For the price, the book is short and underpowered. Unfortunately, it also has more than the normal number of typos."
4,open door to Spanish,"Good book for beginners. Explanations of grammar are easy to understand, exercises help reinforce the concepts, and the number of new words to learn in each chapter isn't overwhelming."
1,Needs editor,"I attempted to read this book, however could not get past the first page. The writing was so poorly done that I simply could not take a sentence to it's end. I have no doubt that Dean is a talented and imaginative person, however the use of an editor would greatly improve his chances of success. I look forward to a book from Dean Romanchuk that is professionally written and published."
5,Neomedieval times,"Excellent analysis from Turin University Group about coincidences of the contemporary times and european Middle Age. In conclusion: today, a neomedieval age."
3,"It will work, but...","I returned this after 3 weeks. Not impressed by the build quality. If you are wondering about why this is not in-stock, they recently had a reacll on these.If you are close to the 250 lb weight limit, be careful, as this might not work due to the flexing of the center column. As it bears the complete load (piviot point), the arms tend to flex, causing the upper arm locking pin to float freely. There is no way to adjust this.It will give you one heck of a workout though. I'm just not convinced that this will last with constant use. Assembly required."
5,The Real Thing,"These are the originals, just as we heard on the radio in the 1950's and '60's. I expect the originals when I see the Rhino label. This was always true in Rhino's early days, but I don't know if they have continued that policy over the years. I still trust Rhino, and I will until I buy something with their label and realize that I have been ripped off. My only complaint is that there were not more than 16 songs on this CD, but I was grateful that they included ""Idol With the Golden Head"", since so many Coaster's collections overlook that gem. This CD is well worth the money. When are CD labels going to realize that this is what we want---the real thing, not the originals that have been computerized to death or remakes that never have the feeling or soul of the originals JUST AS WE HEARD THEM ON THE RADIO."
4,Spitfire Listens,"Some of the transcriptions from original source to product were a little scratchy, but the disc was OK as a whole and fun to listen to."
3,"""The Clown Princes of Rhythm & Blues""","I'm sure this is a great C.D., however I was hoping for a collec-tion which contained my favorite Coasters song, ""Zing Went The Strings of My Heart."" Does a C.D. of this nature exist. I have been hoping to have this song in my collection for a long time. The Coasters are the best when it comes to the funny song. No one does it better. I recommend it highly, but until I find a compilation that contains the forementioned song, I'll pass on this one. Can you help me?"
4,"Easy, funny and quick read.","I had just finished the first book in The Bottom Dollar Girls and I missed the ""girls"". So, I purchased this one. I read it in one day. It was a bit predictable but I still enjoyed it. These books are just fun and easy reads that will make you laugh out loud."
5,great job!,I got this product at the behest of my physical therapist for use at home. It works great and it is easy to use. It is just perfect for continuing therapy at home. THANK YOU!
4,It will tire out any dog,My dog loves this. It keeps him busy for hours. We put it away and he cries. We have owned 2 over the past 3 years and he has completely worn them out. One day we wanted to see how long he would go lets just say we put it away after 8 hours! You do have to be careful though our oldest dog doen't know to say back from the launch part and has gotten a bloody lip from it. Now he just stays away from it. The one who loves it listens to the sound right before it launches he backs away from it to get ready to catch it then he loads the ball into himself and starts all over again.
3,Why no Celsius ?!,I'm working on a cruise ship and I'm european.I'd would buy your proiduct if there were be an option for Celsius degrees there !
5,meat thermometer,"the thermometer lets you know where the roast is without opening the oven door and using a flashlight to read a roast thermometer. i set the alarm about 5 degrees below where i want the roast to get to. when the alarm sounds, i know to make sure everything else for the meal is almost ready. let the meat come up a few more degrees, take it out of the oven and let it come up a few more degrees while you are getting the rest of the meal on plates and platters. no more guesswork, perfect meat every time."
2,Great while it worked,"This was a great addition to my kicthen for the short time it worked (about 12 months). It was very accurate, and having a built in timer meant I could time two dishes (using my oven timer too) at the same time.However all it is now is an expensive timer, as the thermometer part of it registers ""Hi"" all the time.. :-( Haven't been able to find the manufactures details in order to return for replacement."
1,Great ... if the probe would only work reliably!,"We bought ours a year ago. First time we used it it failed. I'm pretty sure it was the probe. Exchanged it for a new unit. It has worked great for a year, but now again it not working. Temperature keeps going up to absured numbers. if you shake the probe cable a bit it sometimes might register properly, but this is not practical. I've been looking for a replacement probe, but no luck yet. I don't mind have to get replacement probes once in a while if they are reasonably priced, but I can't even find one. And the thought of dishing out ... each year for new unit is appauling. Funny enough my grandmothers old analog roast thermonitor works just fine and it's been around for a long time. Trouble is I really like these digital thermonitors. Just not the reliability!"
2,Another probe failure,"I see that I am not the only user whose probe failed after only a few uses. I was looking for Pyrex Customer Service when I came upon Amazon's reviews. I have not yet found a way to replace the probe, and am disappointed in the product."
3,Thermometer review,"I would have given this product 5 stars because it is the best! But after the first time I used it (while cooking meat at 350 degrees), the temperature shown began to flucuate wildly. In trying to figure out what was wrong, I studied the cable that connects the probe to the thermometer and noticed that a spot in it seemed to have been damaged by heat. I don't know if it touched a heating element in the oven there, or what. I have been trying to find a replacement part every since without any luck. So it is a good product, but easily damaged."
3,PROBE PROBLEMS? BOIL IT IN OIL!,Heat the probe in oil at medium high until it stops making bubbles. This can be done in a frying pan with 1/4 inch of oil. I just did it and now have a working probe again. Take care as the oil is hot and there is most likely water in your probe. It took 45 minutes of internet trolling before I came up with this gem.
1,One Use Only,"Worked great the first time only. After the first use, the thermometer only works when it wants too. It shows low temp even after it has reached the desired temp.The timer works great. I now use it as a timer only. I was using the timer outside to grill and accidentally left it in the rain, and it still works."
3,displays wrong temp,"After about a year, it started displaying the wrong temperature. I preset it to alert me when I was cooking an expensive rib roast for the holidays. When the alarm went off (was supposed to be medium rare), not only was the meat well done, it was OVER done...an expensive piece of jerky. It was very embarrasing for me, I had guests over. Also sometimes the alarm doesnt beep, and other times when it does, it gives a sick sounding gurgle. It also gets stuck in Celsius mode most of the time, have to keep flipping the F/C switch and eventually it goes back to F. Since the holiday dinner incident, I have been scared to use it. When it did work, I loved it. 3 stars for a year of use."
1,Doesn't last - Read the other reviews,"Just like almost everyone else this stopped working after about a year. The Lifetime warrenty is basically useless. I don't know if there is a better probe thermometer out there, but this aint it."
2,Calibration fails over time,"I have a Polder and a Pyrex, both of which I bought around the same time over a year ago (use them for bread baking and meat roasting). In the last few months, the meat started to be inexplicably overdone when using the Pyrex. Tried it again for the Thanksgiving turkey. When the turkey seemed to be taking too long, I plugged the probe already in the turkey into the Polder unit instead. Suddenly my 132 degree temp reading went to 158 and the turkey was almost done! We took it out of the oven based on the Polder reading of 165 and it was perfect. In swapping the two probes back and forth, it is clear the Pyrex unit is no longer calibrated correctly and the probe is not the issue. Kind of defeats the point of using a probe termometer. I'd go with another brand if you are looking at purchasing one of these."
5,Good customer service,"This is a good unit. It's very convenient around the kitchen (although it would be nice if the magnet were a little stronger to give it slightly better staying power).The only real problem is that the probes are very delicate. In fact, when my first probe blew out after less than two weeks, I was rather annoyed. However, I mailed the probe back to the Robinson Knife Company and in less than a full week they had sent me a brand new probe. I hadn't expected to see a replacement for at least a month. I was quite happy to be proven wrong.Also, I noticed that the new probe is different than the one that the unit originally came with. It is identical except where the wire enters the probe there is now about a 1.5"" piece of plastic tubing, presumably to keep the probe from being so susceptible to liquids. I haven't had any problems with the unit since.If you don't mind occasionally not having a probe, I would highly recommend this item."
5,Modern Technology,This is so great to have because you can see what the temperature is without even opening your oven door to check. I love modern technology!
3,Probe Problem,"This is a wonderful meat thermometer and I've used it roasting various meats in the oven and on the grill. The problem is the probe. If your unit temperature reads 'HI' all the time, the probe is damaged. I purchased a new unit and used the probe in my old unit and, of course, everything works fine again. So, I have two base units and one probe. :( Can't find any place to just purchase the probe."
1,Worked once,"It worked great the first time I used it. Now I can't get it to give an accurate temperature. Even tried the ""dry the input"" thing."
2,Yet Another Probe Failure,"I only had mine for a month or two when my probe stopped working. Other than that, I really liked it."
1,No replacement probe found,"My Pyrex ""Professional"" digital temperature gauge probe failed yesterday. I have used the thermometer for approx. 3 times in the past few months. I am unable to find a source for a replacement probe. My experience matches another reviewer where the temperature varies greatly when the probe is plugged in.Oh well."
2,Worked well for a while...,"This model worked well for a while. It was used perhaps 2 dozen times, however it now reads far to high, almost as if it is reading oven temperature rather than ""turkey temp"". I suspect the sheilding on the cable has given out. Great tool, but I'll get a different brand next."
1,DO NOT BUY ANY OF THESE!,"I have had about 6 or 7 similar products in the past 12 months, including two of these, just returned. I used all in complete compliance with the instructions, especially with regard to no contact of the probe to oven or grill parts. ALL of them failed within a few weeks, some within a few minutes. The interesting thing is that the probes are identical in appearance, regardless of the brand. I suspect that all the probes are made by the same company and are just total garbage. Don't waste your money - get a good manual bimetal probe instead - they last forever....."
2,"Great Idea, Terrible Reliability","i've had two of them and each has died in a different way. the first one stopped registering any temperature - i think the probe got wet. the second one jumps between Centigrade and Fahrenheit randomly. neither of them lasted much more than a year.if they were only built better, they'd be the best gadget in my kitchen. if they were cheaper, i might not feel bad about buying another one. but there's no way i'm going to spend another $25 on one of these."
5,Great gift - kitchen PLUS!,Gave as a gift to my families' kitchens last year - great and inexpensive gift - perfect for every kitchen.
5,This is very functional,"Got this for christmas. Very easy to use and has magnets on the backside so you can attach it to your stove. We used it on a pork loin, beef roast and it worked great! You can set it to beep at you when it reaches a certain temperature. Easy cleanup since the cord/probe are detachable."
3,I've had 2 now,"They last a year or two, then they start flipping from C to F and back (regardless of the switch position) and resetting themselves spontaneously, then a bit later, the symptoms get more frequent until it's unusable.Also- if you lay the probe onto something too hot (>500'f, iirc) for too long (I think I left one on a burner for a few minutes), it fries the probe.As others have noted- this price (~$100) is CRAZY- all the probes work the same and should be ~$30."
2,"Buy the Polder # 307 PreProgrammed ...Instead, or be Sorry","Things you like about this are in the Polder # 307 Preprogrammed digital Thermometer...plus the 307 has 7 types of meat + an unprogrammed one you can set yourself.... has USDA Temps built in and works off included AAA battery for a long time... Best of all though... the replaceable probe (they all wear out after awhile... gives false readings, goes intermitant) is cheap and easily obtainable...These things are Great and works terrific for the Barbeque too!"
1,broke after forth use,"unit probe registered 220f deg in my kitchen, and i wasn't dead so it was wrong. checked for shorts in the wire, but no change, beat the unit vigorously on the counter and managed to change the temp up to 225 so i beat on it some more, but with no result. no joke - prob went out after four uses. no good don't buyand i had a turkey to back."
5,Waiting to Cook Something,Unfortunately I bought this at the wrong time of the year. I don't use my oven during the summer but can't wait until the fall so I can test this out. Shipping was quick and it looks so easy to use. Is it Thanksgiving yet?
2,Works great . . . when it's working,"Had mine for about a year and the probe is wigging out already. When it is working, it's a great product. The computer part works just fine. Pyrex needs to improve the probe and have replacements available. It's far to delicate (not good for temperatures of 400 degrees, not submursible, don't handle it rough, etc.). I don't have patience for that!"
2,Not real accurate,"I purchased this to use in candy making. Before I used it I tested it in boiling water. Three times gave three different temperatures, none of them within six degrees of 212F. I guess it would be OK for steaks and roasts, but candy is real sensitive."
4,DO NOT PAY $100 FOR THIS!,"It's a fine probe thermometer -- after a year and half mine is starting to act a little blippy, but other than that all has been good so far -- but I paid $20 for it (new) at a restaurant supply store. Heed the other reviewers who have also paid in the $20-25 range at other merchants, like Bed Bath & Beyond."
3,It can in fact measure Celsius,"I haven't had a chance to use this yet, but I just received it and I wanted to point out that it does in fact measure Celsius in addition to Farenheit. There's a small switch on the back to specify the measurement unit.I was a little disappointed to discover the label on the box stating not to use the probe at over 400F or on a grill. I had hoped to use it for grilling and broiling as well."
2,Consistantly reads above temp,"I have owned this thermometer for two years now. It has always consistantly read 10-15 degrees (F) over actual temperature. I first used it on Thanksgiving, pulling a very underdone bird out of the oven. Since then I have used the thermometer, following instructions, about half a dozen times, all with the same results. I now set my thermometer higher than my target temp with okay results, but I'd rather have a thermometer that reads accurately."
5,good product,"I have used this thermometer several times and it has performed flawlessly. I have no way of measuring to see if the temperature readings are correct, but the meat I cooked was ok. If anything, the readings were a little high, i.e., when it said the meat was done medium, it turned out to be slightly on the rare side. Maybe it's just me. Anyway, Im happy with it."
2,No good for many applications,"Just arrived. On the back of the box: ""Do not use in ovens with temps higher than 400 degrees""Many, many recipes (meat!) require temperatures higher than 400. Bizarre."
2,"Worked great, until it didn't","Bought this at a local store, and it was great. And then, it wasn't. Took a bird out of the oven at a nice 160... went to cut it and it was still rare. Used an instant read and it showed a nice 130. Thought maybe I had just put it in the wrong spot and it touched a bone. But no, after washing it was sitting on my counter showing a nice toasty warm 104.It's a great timer for the kids now."
2,Probe Failure,"This thermometer worked fine a few times, then the probe failed. There seems to be a spot on the cable that looks damaged. I'm somewhat disappointed, since I only used it twice. Now I'm trying to find a site where I can buy a replacement probe."
3,Pretty good,"I actually would like to give this book a 3.5 star rating.What I liked...I'm a mega fan of mafia and vampire movies, tv shows, books, whatever, so the thought of both together was almost too much for me to bear.I liked the storyline and the ending was nice, unexpected which is critical in this genre.The artwork was very nice, I liked that as well.What I did not like was that there wasn't much ""vampirisminvolved. It was not balanced well enough for my taste, but that's just me.It's worth purchasing, a nice comic to read on a lazy day."
3,Doesn't cover the entire city,"The popout map is a great concept, and this map would probably work fine for someone who is just visiting the more popular areas of the city. But be warned, this map only covers the very northern part of San Francisco - nothing south of Golden Gate Park is shown! If you need a map that covers the more residential parts of the city, such as the Mission District, Sunset, Bayview and beyond, you'll want to look elsewhere."
3,disappointed in Product,I am very disappointed in this product. Tomato Sauce discolored the clear Spatula and the Silicone portion appears loose. Would not purchase this item again.
2,This is NOT MUSA's translation,"Note,This is Longfellow's translation, as it says at the title of this item, NOT MUSA's, which is the translation reviewed. I have nothing against Longfellow's translation, but I alredy bought that in Kindle version, and I was interested to see how Kindle would deal with Musa's side by side translation. So, now I know. It doesn't. It isn't musa, this is a false, misleading, mistaken set of reviews."
2,Not for me,"Inferno is the first part of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy (before Purgatorio and Paradiso).In this book, we follow Dante as he visits Hell, walking down its nine consecutive Circles accompanied by the poet Virgil, and meeting old acquaintances on the way.This should not become a habit, but I intend to stop after the first volume and not finish the trilogy. First, I realize I'm simply not sensitive to poetry. Then, there are too many references to public or mythical figures of the Antiquity and 13th-century Florence, and I'm not sufficiently educated in History and Biblical Lore to enjoy this book.Still, Sisson's modern English translation is good and reads easily. The notes at the end of the book are well-done and help understand what Dante is referring to, but I was too lazy to constantly check back and forth. I'm wondering if it would have been a better choice if they'd been placed in the margin."
2,The Divne Comedy,"I chose this translation because the translator had an Italian name, but found it unsatisfactory. It doesn't have the tone of the original. Unfortunately, I haven't found a translation that does."
5,"The Divine Comedy, a trip through Hell, Dante did good work.","The Divine Comedy, Dante is one wrier that makes you know you dont want to go to Hell."
1,Not the MUSA version,"I bought this for my Kindle due to the excellent reviews for the Musa version without looking at the sample first. Once I opened it up, it was clear that this is NOT the Musa version but a straight translation by Longfellow, which is far, far from what I was looking for. I'm calling customer service about this. The $2 for the Kindle version isn't the point, but it isn't even CLOSE to what the reviews match too. And when typing in Musa's name for a search, this is the only link that comes up. Very disappointing from such a stellar organization like Amazon."
5,The most wonderful translation I have read.,"This translation is a masterpiece! It kept me up all night with it's artful horror, and yet kept me in awe by Dante's great skill and tecnique! No other translation to me knowladge comes close!"
4,One of the better translations,"I didn't know a lot about Dante's Divine Comedy before I decided to read this. I paged through several different translations and decided on Mark Musa's work. Most of the translations are laborious to follow. If you are looking for a version of the Inferno that is direct and easy to understand, this is the version for you.Musa begins each canto (chapter) with an introduction and provides, at the end of each canto, a further explanation of many of the items in the book. Dante makes continuous references to people, events, and other literature that nobody except scholars that pour over this book will get. Musa fills in these gaps and, in several cases, provides the different interpretations that translators over time have thought.The book itself was a little less enjoyable than I expected (at times, I felt that Dante wrote it to put all of his political enemies in a literary hell), but Musa deserves much praise for his translation."
4,Wish there was an update for this fabulous book,"I recently purchased a copy of this for my daughter. The book was written in the '80's, but is still the best guide for acquiring a classic wardrobe ever written. It has been invaluable to me."
3,Too Much Filler,One of the directors took a picture of James Baldwin and uses it to fill up space on the DVD. The photo is used in a series of collages and they distract the focus of the DVD from James Baldwin to the author as an artist.
2,I should of listen to the reviews,"The edited of this DVD.For price i payed.This look like it was put together by some one with a cell phone,pre- iPhone."
5,Portrait of an underrated pianist,"People forget what a marvellous pianist Bernstein really was, and this disc is testament to his considerable talent. I love Beethoven's first concerto and it is this recording I always return to among many versions I own. While Bernstein is certainly guilty of the big orchestra treatment (this cd is not for fans of ""authentic"" performances), he shows great insight into both composers and plays with tremendous skill and virtuosity. The sound is outstanding, certainly much better than some other ""Royal Edition"" releases. Speeds are broad, but not slow, and overall there is a sense of enjoyment conveyed in the music making. I recommend it."
1,Junk,"These have a one year warranty for a reason. Because they split in the middle.So if you are into replacing your tongs every 2-3 years, these are for you.If you pay for name brands for a reason other than the name, keep shopping. This isn't for you."
1,Not Tongs,"I was looking for tongs that I could use with my new non-stick fry pan. They looked like they would work just fine and Kitchen Aid is a good product, so I thought. They wouldn't pick up a thin chicken cutlet. The cutlet just slid right out. The more pressure I applied to the handles, the larger the separation between the tips of the tongs. So I'm still looking for a set of tongs."
2,They melted!,"They work OK to swish around something on very low heat, but I leaned them against the edge of a frying pan while frying bacon on high heat, and they melted all over the edge of the pan. Am shopping for a silicone replacement now."
2,UMM SERIOUSLY,"Bad movie, I could not watch more than 10 minutes of this . I hope what I spent goes to a good cause."
2,An amateur mockumentary,"To start, I will admit this is not what I expected. I believed this was a documentary analyzing the popularity of zombie films, television, and the like. Instead, it's an amateur mockumentary. Here is the problem though: it's not interesting, informative, or that entertaining. I understand that the intent of the mockery (cheesy dialogue, poor quality filming, bad acting) is to be funny, but I didn't laugh. I ended up not even being able to force myself to watch it to the end. Had it not been so inexpensive, I would have asked for a refund."
4,Review of Atlas of the Greek World,"I cannot utterly condemn this atlas, because it is an excellent source of maps and information; it presents a complete picture of Greek history from the earliest archaeological data to the imprint of Greece on the modern world. However, it is almost without doubt that there are similar resources with superior information: newer, more thorough, more updated.Also, the author has an obvious bias toward art history, which is almost always the focus of his overview. This is nice, but one would appreciate similar, extensive coverage of political movements and philosophical trends.A likely resource for a public library, but for the individual I would recommend something newer."
4,The Yuppie Don Bows Out,"Michael Franzese is a likeable guy. He now goes around campuses and preaches to athletes about the dangers of gambling. Gambling always leads to gangsters. That said, I decided to look up his book from awhile back and read it. This guy was some racketeer. I knew his father, Sonny Franzese, was huge in the Colombo family, but his son's accomplishments eclipsed his monetarily. Gas schemes brought this guy millions. But like always, his higher-ups started showing jealousy which eventually lead him to flip. He's trying to make restitution all these years later. Good luck and good book."
5,The Great Lucky Chance,"On his ""The Last Second Chance"" CD, Drew James has created his own music realm, attractive and hospitable to any Real Music lover, no matter his or her genre preferences. Strictly speaking, the album is recorded in a folk-rock key, but there's so much True Blue feeling in every track that they sound ""more Blues"" to me than many of the ""canonized"" 12-bar standards. The arrangements and performance are tasteful and natural, and the production is simply perfect (a George Martin level work done by guitarist Bruce Kaphan). To those yet deciding whether to buy or not this CD, I'd say it'd be one of their best investments, a ""long term"" one - the more you play this record, the better it sounds. Drew James' music world is a place to stay - ""you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave""."
4,Camp TV classic from 1984,"Fans of TV movies from the 70's and 80's will enjoy this one. Amazons are still alive and well! They're plotting to take over mandkind! Stars sexy Stella Stevens and a young, hunky Jack Scalia."
5,This Book is a great military history book,This book uses great computer-generated battlefeild layouts and descriptions on each battlefeild to help the reader understand the tactics and politics of the battle and the weaponary used in the battle from B.C. to the Korean War
1,Extremely outdated!,"I thought this book was totally different than it was. It's absolutely outdated. No nice pictures as I hoped, old outlook. Wish I didn't buy it."
1,Innovage AM/FM Weather Band Radio,"I bought this item and it has been useless. The FM reception is very poor, but the worst problem is in the weather band. I have not been able to hear one word on this. The tiny pamplet is extremely brief, containing more instruction on battery installation than anything else. It is completely void of any information on how to contact the manufacturer. As far as I'm concerned, this radio is worthless."
1,Rip Off,"Though the price is attractive this little radio is hardly worth the plastic it is built in. I personally live near a NOAA tower for the radio. Heck I even can see it from my backyard. This little radio can't even pick it up. It can hardly pickup any of the FM stations in town too! The light it produces is very poor, even with brand new batteries.Don't waste your money on this radio."
2,Quality control issues make this the luck of the draw,"I've been reading reviews for this unique radio that range from very poor to fantastic. From my experience, they are all correct as there seems to the factor of getting a good one or a dud. Mine has a great FM tuner, but very poor AM and weather band. FM works as good as you could ever expect and then some. AM is so poor that every station on the dial bleeds over on each other (I am assuming it's a defect). Weather band is very weak overall. I could barely pick up my local station.The LED flashlight works very well.Overall it's truly the luck of the draw. You might get a good one, you might get a dud. Down side is, you feel cheated when you get a dud!"
2,"cheap, but it is cheap","Works, and is obviously low cost, but during an emergency with noise all around I would want (and should be willing to pay for) a better radio."
1,madder red,"The product that I recieved is not the same edition as the one pictured on the websight and is a very low quality version. I sent it back because it wouldn't have lasted- I recieved a crummy glue bound book with cheap paper inside of a glossy cardboard cover. I've seen the edition that is shown on the websight and its a nice, properly-bound book with dust jacket. Amazon charged me for the return shipping saying that it was not their fault that I was dissatisfied with the book. (I contend.)"
2,cheap and short,Bought these as part of a costume. They are extremely cheap looking and seem shorter in the package than on the model. I think you could do better for the price.
4,Fun stuff,"Not only did those crazy Nintendo guys bring back one of their great (underated at the time) games. It brings back the original Mario brothers game for an added boost of cartoonishly (kinda close to bad taste even but ah heck)italianism americanism video gaminism. ""It-sa' me Mario."" You get to hear goofy voices from good guys and bad guys alike on both games. Not too mention what was missing from the first go 'round, a save function that gives clutzy gamers such as myself a way to beat this thing without sitting up for days hoping the batteries last. New weapons, new moves, new enemies, and surprisingly more fun then I remember from sleep overs at friends..."
3,Not Worth Buying,This game is noT really that fun but there are two games in one. That is the point that is fun in this game. But the two games are really old. I suggest you not to buy this game!!!
4,Mario GBA,"I got this for my son, he was amazed by it and had a lot of fun even though he isn't very good at it. I would recommend this one"
4,Super Mario Advance (for GBA),"Super Mario Advance is one of the few Mario games that seem identical to the originals on the first Nintendo gaming platform. Over 12 levels, all in great color and bristling with tricks at every turn. This may be too hard for younger children, but is a great game for older children and teens."
3,Good. But wait.,"I like this game in all, but i would wait until Super MArio Advance 2. I mean its fun in all but to me, Super Mario Advance 2 was the best on SNES. Hey. Its only in my opinion. Plus, the game is easy and the bosses aren't as difficult."
3,O.K.....I guess...,"This game is pretty fun... until you... throw your GBA against the wall. Heres how I rate it:Graphics:4/5- Just like the NES (or SNES, I forget)version. Colorful and easy to see, but kind of old-school.Sound:2/5-This has to be the worst part of the whole game. It's even worse than a Brittney Spears song!Gameplay:3/5-Like I said, you get so frustrated, you want to take a sledgehammer and crush the little game cartridge into a billion pieces. Fun half the time, nerve racking the other half.Average:3/5-If you are a fan of the NES (or SNES) version, I would say this is a good game for you, but if you are short-tempered, try something else, like Tony Hawk 2, Tony Hawk 3, or a fighting game like Street Fighter 2 or Tekken."
5,cool.,this game is a bit tricky i wasn`t sure if i should give it a 4 star or five so i gave it a five star. the game is great there are no passwords to enter (thank god) now i havn`t gotten passed the 2nd world because i got gt adavance just a few days after i got this game and i havn`t had time to play super mario advance.
3,Not Enthused...,"I was disappointed to see that Nintendo chose Super Mario 2, the lamest of all the Mario games, for this fabulous new Game Boy. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are beautiful and the game play is true to the original but I do get tired of the little exclamations and comments the characters make in the game whenever they get hurt or die. As for the other Mario game included on this game pak, there's not much point to it unless you have another player to play it with. Most people will probably like this game just fine, especially the younger players, but I just detest Super Mario 2 and I resent having it thrust upon me again (it came with the Game Boy Advance)."
4,Super Mario Advance,"This is such a fun game! It definately deserves 5 stars, and I want to give it 5 stars because it's so fun... Let me start off. Both of these games are fun and exciting. SM2 is different from other Mario games. This game is really frusturating though. And even though it's tough, you beat it in a few days. But put aside all that and it deserves 5 stars. After you beat it you get to play the Yoshi challenge. This is extremely frusturating and all you get for beating it is a little Yoshi waving on your screen. But I suggest you get this game. You won't regret it!"
4,"Great, but stiill has bugs.","Scroll bugs let over from SM2 are still there. Keep the classic play, but fix the bugs. An underapreciated Mario chapter."
4,"It Good, but not like the Snes version","IT has good gameplay, and the graphics are good, but the abilities and availabilities found the the SNES version a deffinately lacking. Also you cant move around the world as you please, and there are no special levels. other than that, it a good game."
4,Mario Shines,"This is a great port of Super Mario 2. The graphics are superb and the sound is wonderful. All of the levels remain exactly the same from Super Mario 2 with one added bonus. After you beat the game you get to go on all of the levels again and find 2 Yoshi eggs for each level, sounds easy? It isn't this game will thrill you for hours. The only gripe I have is that it is a PORT and therfore has no new levels, I wish they would make a brand new Mario game for GBA instead of ports."
2,The only BAD Mario game!,"Mario is known all over the world by his famous super jump which smashes enemies into the ground. Unfortunelty, this game has no super jumps. You have to throw vegetables to kill your enemies. This is the worst idea for a Mario game. The good thing is that you get to choose from four diffrent characters, Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad, and it includes the amazing Link It Up, which allows four players to play from the same gamepack (Note: you will need the link cable).I just don't like it because they killed the Mario classics. Buy it if you enjoy wasting your money! (in other words, don't buy it)"
1,horrible,"this is the worst mario game that i have seen. Its not mario-type (you know, jumping on the bad guys, collecting coins, etc.) Since this was one of the original games for GBA you would think that it would be really good like all originals are. Personally, I dont like it and i ended up leaving it in my friends car. get Super Mario World instead... much better."
1,O la la,This game is the pits! Its the worst Mario game ever. Even worse than Mario 64.Pros: Nice GraphicsCons: Makes you madder than the Mad Hatter!Terrible GameplayToo hard
1,good graphics but bad gameplay,the graphics are great but the gameplay is not at all like the other super mario brother games. i think this game is the worst in the series. it goes from easy to extremely hard and after a while u get bored. lets just say i wouldnt want to buy this game. the only reason y it got one star is because the classic mario arcade game is included.
2,Whats wrong with nintendo,"Ok i am disapointed why nintendo choose Super Mario 2 for the realase of Game Boy Advance. For people woh haven't played it for nes or snes, i guess i can understnad y they like the game. Super Mario 3 was defintaly the 2nd best game on nes to zelda, And Super mario rpg on snes has to be one of the funiest and best games ever made for snes. I am not totally dissing super mario 2, I have to admit it is alot funner to play on game boy advance and it sure looks better, but nintendo has made yet another stupid stupid mistake."
3,Here we go again By: a peice of cheese,Yes this is a improvement over Game boy color but the reality of it is its the same old game that we played on NES.
5,Just What You Wanted!,Mario Advance lives up to the name. Its Mario with great visuals and the same addictive gameplay. They have added some extras here and their. This is one game that you will be playing forever.
3,Game is okay but could be better,"I have played the Super Mario Advance Japanese import version of it and it is okay, but the characters talk TOO MUCH. They should be an option to have the voices turned on, off, some or alot, but it is still a good idea. The Super Mario Bros. game is okay, but not one of my favorite games in this game pak. They should of added new levels to the game to make it more exciting and different. My opinion is if you like all the Super Mario Bros. games for the NES get the Super Mario All-Stars game pak for the Super Nintendo."
4,Where is Yoshi?,The game is great but I would of liked it if Yoshi was in it better...but I guess thats ok.
3,"Great classic revived, but...","I picked up the import of this game and am really enjoying it. Super Mario Bros 2 is an all time favorite of mine, and the GBA version is pretty good. Great graphics, excellent sound (lots of voices), and some nice additional touches. But this game really is just SMB2 with some very slight changes, and made slightly easier. I was under the impression this was going to be an all new Mario game based on the SMB2 engine. This marks the first release of a Nintendo system without a truly new Mario game. Which was disappointing.But as long as you know this is just a slightly enhanced SMB2, you can't go wrong."
3,Super Mario Advance,"Pretty good game, not as good as some of the Mario games. Nice game for kids between 4 and 7. I enjoyed this game 15 years ago and had to buy it for my Nintendo DS."
1,Okay Game,"This game was okay. It was not really one of the games that you just can't put down. At first, you have to chose a player every time you lose. After a while, I just kept hitting the buttons until I got back to the game. But the good thing about it was that it was fun to play when you got used to it."
3,Mario Bros. and Super Mario Bros. 2 on GBA,"The 4 player feature on the GBA is pretty cool, and this game is perfect for testing it out. In fact, that's the real part of this game. You get two Mario games in one, and the multiplayer part is based on the arcade game, Mario Bros. 4 at maximum can link their GBAs and cartridges to play together and work together by taking out enemies. If you only have one cartridge, then you can play Battle Mode together and fight in one arena. The one player game is a remake of Super Mario Bros. 2. This doesn't make use of the GBAs power, but the classic game gives a bit of fun. It's better than a normal platformer, and a good side quest when you're not playing the better multiplayer half of the game."
3,I found this to be disappionting.,"I really was not able to enjoy this title as much as I thought. Bosses are hard, the whole game looks cartoony, and it was not able to hold my interest for very long. Definetely a weak title."
2,Dissapointing,"Do not buy this game. Even if you loved this game before, don't buy it. Whenever you jump and land on an object, it feels like your sliding. I got bored of this after an hour. And don't just buy the game to play multiplayer unless you want to spend 6 hours playing that stupid POW game with four people. The singleplayer is boring on that to. I hope Nintendo comes out with Super Mario 3 or even Super Mario World from the SNES. All in all, I can safely say now the only game worth playing my GBA is Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2, other than that, forget it."
3,"Mario, yet another adventure","We all know that Mario 64 is the game that started Nintendo 64 off to a great start, but, will this one start Gameboy Advance? Well, I'm not quite sure. Yes, it does have many features such as four characters to choose from and it has the classic version or the new version, but, this game just didn't have the certain edge to it that video games need. I bought this game and played it right away, and I found that after a few days of playing it, it was boring. All you basicly do is jump over enimies and run, no real stratagy to it. There were no special moves, no special items. The best part was that once you finally beat the game you have to find two yoshie eggs from each level(but yoshies don't hatch!). Even this got boring after a while. The best part of the game was that if you get a special potion you can travel to subspace for a period of about 10 seconds."
2,Nothing new!,"I am a big fan of Mario games, so I automatically bought this game when I purchaced the GBA. I should have read the discription first. This is nothing more than Mario 2 for the origional system, that I played and won when I was twelve or so. I just think that the first Mario game that Nintendo comes out with for a new Game Boy system should be a new conception. I should have had a little more forethought when I bought this game, but I'm still a little disapointed."
3,Dissapointed!,Received the game. Grandson played it and really like it but for the first time since we got the game my grandson and his sister tried to play the Multiplayer for more than one player and the game would not work. I still would purchase from this company but companies need to make sure the whole game plays before stating it.
1,gee..........,"super mario advance 2 is better than this,at least it has the classic super mario world which is really awesome but this like balh. get the 2nd version. youll like it more than this."
2,Super Mario Advance is ok 4 the GBA cause .............,"To the Person who reads this,In my opinion I give this game 2 stars cause it was very easy to finish especially Super Mario 2.Mario Bros,is hard enough but it took me 1.5 hours to finish.It took me 3 hours to finish Mario Bros.It made me feel good cause I never finished or won any game unless it was finished before by my brother (...).But I give this game 2 stars because I got sick off it and especially Lego Island 2 for this Platform"
5,Can you teach an old Mario new Tricks? Yes!,"Mario returns to the spotlight. But it's not a new Mario games. It's actually Super Mario Bros. 2 and the Original Mario game from the regular Nintendo Entertainment System. Now you can go head to head with up to four people using the GBA link cable. Plus only one person has to have the Super Mario Advance cartridge, the other players can just download the stage to play it. So Super Mario Advance is one awsome remake of an older game. ...."
2,Super Mario Advance,This game gets very boring. It is not very exiting and the music gets very annoying. I would'nt recommend this game.
2,below average game,"This game should not be your first choice if you are looking for a quality 1-player experience. The updated version of Super Mario Bros 2 is worse than the original one for the NES. The new voices are incredibly annoying(especially Toad). The graphics and gameplay are not noticibly much better either. The best part of this game is the original Mario Bros game which is great with two or more players via a link cable. Overall,this game isn't really up to par with many of the other Mario games for GBA. Some recommendations are Mario Kart: Super Circuit and Super Mario Advance 2: Super Mario World."
2,ok game but kind of confusing,i think that mario is always funner when it is on a big screen. some of the levels in mario advance are confusing and dull. i do not suggest this game to anyone. do not buy it without renting it first.
1,Warp City,"This is going to sound like a similar customer review, but I also bought the Kaiser cookie sheet on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated, and was extremely disappointed. They warped the second time I used them. They also discolored when I used them to bake a pizza. The pizza shape remains, with a blue ring around the outside of the sheet. I wanted to bake a tart on one of the cookie sheets in case the filling ran over, but the warp on the sheet was so bad that I couldn't risk a big disaster. Save your money for another brand."
4,"Warps like all the rest, but still great","I bought the Kaiser on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated, and for the most part they live up to the hype. They do discolor quickly, and while the discoloration can be removed with Bar Keeper's Friend, it doesn't affect the cooking so I don't bother. The size and feel of the sheet is perfect. Despite what Cook's claimed, they warp in the oven almost as much as the Ekco, but it's never been a problem. I bake a lot of chocolate chip cookies, and these sheets brown them more evenly than any other I've used. While I harbor an extravagant wish to try the All-Clad cookie sheet, really I can't imagine needing a better one than the Kaiser."
4,One of the better pepper mills for the price,"If you buy crushed black pepper, stop immediately. There is a world of difference between store bought pre-ground pepper and freshly cracked pepper, which is MUCH more aromatic and very tasty.This is a nice pepper mill and salt shaker set, pretty enough to put on the table, but also very functional, and not just decorative. The pepper mill grinds pepper to a fine, even consistency. It will hold about 3 heaped tablespoons of black pepper, but you don't want to put more than 1 in the pepper mill at a time. Keep the remainder in an air-tight container at room temperature until ready to use.You can measure the amount of pepper you dispense (20 cranks of the handle equals half a teaspoon), or just sprinkle it directly on top of whatever. The matching salt shaker does not have grinding parts (which would have been nice for crushing rock salt), but works fine with kosher table salt.I like stainless steel because I think it looks nice, and resists scratches."
3,cheap quality,the item looks metallic but is actually all plastic and has a cheapish feel to it. Not quite as attractive as depicted.
5,Awesome Fun X3,"I picked this up recently in the UK (1/3 the import price)and have not been able to stop listening to it. I have to agree with the one reviewer below that this is not typical of what you would expect from renaissance because it is much more of a commercial sound than what they have put out before but, it is really a awesome compilation. I love the ""At the Bar"" Cd but really all three have their own merit. If you are new to house and trance or a long time fan you must have this CD. Its just out and out fun!!!! BUY IT NOW!!!"
5,Disc 1 is outstanding,"My context is music to work by (computer programming) and I do best with lively, moody, but not too dance-heavy techno. Disc 1 of this group, ""At The Bar"" is one of the very best I have ever heard, period. I'd love to know what reviewer Shen thinks is superior to this."
1,WARNING: Read this before you buying this CD,"Hi all, Before I begin let me say that I am the most undying renaissance fan. As far as I am concerned renaissance RULES. I have bought just about every single renaissance compilation and praise them for there quality with a captial Q. However I do not feel the same about this compliation. DO NOT BUY THIS COMPILATION. Renaissance has totally sold out everything they used to stand for with this album. This new renaissance album has NO QUALITY. The track choice is BAD, the CD is NOT mixed by a DJ. The tracks are mainly very commercial mainstream tracks with one or two good songs thrown in. Believe me you will be disappointed. Just look at the cover and you will immediately see something is different. Upon closer examination you will find that very little money was spent on the cover design..."
3,"Great hardware, horrible support","I have used PaperPort/Visioneer scanners for close to a decade, and loved them all. For some reason, though, their code gets worse and worse and their ""support"" simply does not exist.For some reason, in order to install a new scanner, you have to remove all vestiges (even hidden ones) of the prior scanner software and drivers. Forget installing TWO scanners (I have both a Visioneer flatbed and a Strobe XP 450).Is it too much to ask to get support for an item that costs $650?"
2,XP 450 Constantly loses Connection,"I use this in a law office/buiness setting with an IBM laptop running Windows 2000. The problem is if I do not scan something for about an hour, the scanner loses its connection and you have to turn it off and back on to get it to scan. A royal pain in the you now what since the power button is on the back. I called Visioneer support and they said ""That is the way it works - if you do not use it it loses connection."" I think that is BS. My HP did not. If someone else has problem and a fix, let me know. Otherwise, our office just nixed buying 50 more of these since I was the test case."
1,Be very careful,"Be VERY careful when purchasing anything from Visioneer. I have owned a visioneer scanner for about 4 years, and when I upgraded my PC to Vista, was shocked to learn that Visioneer considers it ""out of production"" and therefore no new drivers are available. In short, I now own a boat anchor. If you think you might EVER upgrade your computer, you might be better off purchasing from a company who supports their equipment. By the way, I had to call a 900 number to find out that the product is no longer supported - I actually had to PAY to get ripped off."
4,Great Value,"This is a really nice sign. what I like most is the thickness of the metal. I shopped some local hardware stores and all I found was flimsy metal signs--really thin metal. The color on this sign is bright. For the money, even with shipping, this is a really great sign for the price. A good value. No regrets! The reason I am awarding 4 stars out of 5 is because I have purchased one of these from a store once before. Within 5 years,the color of this sign will fade. This is probably due to UV exposure, but still for the money, it is a good value."
4,Worked perfectly for terminating my Audioengine speaker cable,"I wanted to terminate the 14 gauge replacement stereo wire that I purchased for my Audioengine A2 powered speakers. These spades were very inexpensive, and I wasn't sure how they'd perform. Fact is, they seem to perform flawlessly, and the sound quality with my 25' wire is at least as good as with the ~12' stereo wire that comes with the speakers. I gave the item 4 stars because a few of the plastic sleeves would tear as I backed them over the copper shielding, and in one case, a spade snapped while I was crimping the loop that holds the exposed wire strands. Considering that the package contains far more spades than I will need in multiple lifetimes, the failure of one or two pieces is trivial. Glad I bought these in lieu of more expensive solutions."
2,Not worth the money!,The design on the front is great but the cover is way too heavy for the holder it broke the first time I tried to move it.
4,nice,Very nice product and the daughter liked it very much. It broke the first night but I think it was her fault not the product. Thanks
2,nightlight,"I received this product broken. The horse part of the light is way to heavy for the base it sits on, there was one screw holding it in, the other was missing ."
1,DON'T GET IT,UNLESS YOU LIKE TO FIX THINGS AS SOON AS YOU GET THEM... IT WAS BOXED FINE. AND IT IS PRETTY. BUT IT DID NOT STAY TOGETHER JUST PULLING IT OUT OF THE BOX. THE PICTURE ITSELF WAS NOT BROKEN.
4,A nice taste of music from the past!,"This is a nice, reminiscent variety of music from the 40's. Though not terribly extensive (ten songs), the pieces certainly represent enjoyable highlights from the time period."
4,"Good Old, Old Songs","This CD is packed with great tunes from the late 40s. When I was growing up most of these songs were playing on my parents radio which gave me a soft spot in my heart for them. If you are looking for a good sampleing of the era. A couple of songs on this cd were the first 45s (singles from a happier time gone by) I bought as a kid. This CD is not Pop or Rock it is a reflexction of what music was in the Good Old Days, so pick it up and reminiss as I do."
3,it was just ok...,"It needs more horse stuff! And Lisa- logical, thinker Lisa- should have been able to smell what that rat Tec was up to a mile away! He never did anything with her, and was just a huge jerk. And Stevie- well, why would she rather paint a tack room than do something else? That part could be way more exciting, as well as some other parts. One word sums up this book- BLECH! If you want to read a good book, read Hobbyhorse! I could not put that one down."
4,Great book and supplier,"The supplier got the book here in a few days. I Recommend starting at earlier point in the series for 1-3 graders, as this one was a little mature (beginning kissing)...maybe 5th grade and up??"
2,Not Bonnie's Best,"WARNING: If you haven't read this book, and you don't like other people spoiling it--do not read this reveiw!!!!If you like horsey, horsey, horse--like me--do not read this book. If you're in to boys--unlike me--you can read this book. Lisa should have smelled a rat in Tec. He never wanted to do stuff with her. And he totally forgot about her performance in the talent show--EVEN THOUGH SHE TOLD HIM!!!Stevie's part of the storie didn't have much horse in it either. It was just mainly cleaning the tack room. I think they should've had more horsey, horsey, horsey.So read it if you'd like, but as I said, if you like more horses less boys--DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!"
5,about the book,"Rugs and carpets have long been a source of beauty and comfort throughout the world, and although their designs are as various as the cultures of their makers, the structure of the rugs themselves is remarkably uniform,. While the allure of rugs and carpets is obvious, their origins, manufacture and the significance of their designs have too long remained obscure, even to admirers. David black a leading London carpet expert has brought together an international panel of specialist to share their expertise. The background information they provide is a fascinating as it is essential in understanding the value and appreciating the beauty of rugs and carpets. . ."
4,Buy this Book!,"I read this book last year. Oh, my goodness! This story is definately a page turner. I sat in one siting and read the book, ok, I think it was 2 days but I literally could not put this book down. The characters are so believable that it makes me question if this is fact or fiction. I liked some characters and hated others. I don't want to give away to much on this book but this is a book that's definately worth the money. It deals with brainwashed people, the occult & how far lust, power & greed will drive you. I'd recommend it to anyone, this writer definately has talent and will go far, continue with these intriguing story. I've recommended this book to everyone. I hope the author does more to get this book out, it's very ingenious & spellbinding. Sincerely, Marlena Martin www.supernovafilms.com"
5,The Fastest I Ever Read A Book,"I read this book back in 2006 and it was soo good! I have never read a book that I was up in the middle of the night, sleepy and having to be up early, but just could not put it down. Maybe it has something to do with that this may have been a real account of someone's life, but whatever it is, I always have to tell people about this book.There are so many twists and turns and as the previous review states, it is ""spellbinding"". There are some grammatical errors, but the story is so gripping that it doesn't even matter. You will not be disappointed!!"
3,Too bad it didn't last...,"The Spin Doctors were not the greatest jam band in the world. But their single, ""Little Miss Can't Be Wrong"" was a lot of fun, however derivative of, for example, the Steve Miller Band it may have been. (A frightening thought, really; as the SMB was nothing but derivative, itself.) The Spin Doctors were, IMHO, the last really fun rock band before the joyless dead hand of grunge, with its cheap nihilism, came down on the '90s music scene. Still, one hit is one more hit than most bands ever get. Spin Doctors, R.I.P. on the has-been circuit, and thanks for the memory."
3,A few good songs,"I recall about two years of fame for Spin Doctors, which is when I bought this CD - ""Two Princes"" got a lot of air time. My favorite is ""Jimmy Olsen's Blues""."
1,Easily the worst band in existence,"Another reviewer said ""The Spin Doctors' album Pocketful Of Kryptonite is sure to amaze and appeal to most people of even mediocre musical taste."" I would change that to ""ONLY to people of mediocre musical taste.""Bland, white-boy funk for people who wouldn't know soul if it bit them in their non-moving white butts."
1,Tom Petty Called He Wants His Riff Back,"I hate this band, first of all two princes has some of the worst lyrics ever in musical history (no wonder it was one of the worst songs according to Blender) and mainly because they stole the music for Little Miss Can't Be Wrong from Tom Petty's ""Don't Do Me Like That"" from his 1979 album Damn the Torpedos.Don't But This CD"
5,One of my favorite all time.,"Great album. Spin Doctors wrongly got the reputation from critics as a flash in the pan one hit wonder who couldn't handle the success. In fact they are a extremely talented band who put out an outstanding body of fun, catchy, jamming rock music. Dig it."
5,TRACK LIST,Track Listing1. Jimmy Olsen's Blues2. What Time Is It?3. Little Miss Can't Be Wrong4. Forty Or Fifty5. Refrigerator Car6. More Than She Knows7. Two Princes8. Off My Line9. How Could You Want Him (When You Know You Could Have Me?)10. Shinbone Alley / Hard To Exist
5,The Spin Doctors Spin Out of Control!,"The Spin Doctors' album ""Pocketful Of Kryptonite"" is sure to amaze and appeal to most people of even mediocre musical taste. This, their first studio album (and their most successful), gives the same bite as their legendary performances in the bars and smaller musical establishments of New York City. Buy it! Play it! Loan it to friends! You won't regret it! If you've heard ""Two Princes"" or ""Little Miss Can't be Wrong"" or even if you haven't buy it, there is more to this band than those two songs. This is a worthwhile financial investment (I even bought 2 of them!!). Have fun!"
3,"let's be honest, here","hear me out: this may be one of the most dated albums ever created, but the singles, ""little miss can't be wrong,"" ""jimmy olsen's blues,"" and especially ""two princes"" are great pop songs, no ifs or ands or buts about it. ""two princes,"" in fact, is one of the great songs of the early 90s, and in this context, its datedness makes it all the richer. the rest of the album is scarcely worth mentioning."
4,Spin these doctors.,"Even though this album quickly made an appearance in used stores across the country, it's actually really good. Part ""Chili Peppers"", part ""Blues Traveler"", the Spin Doctors rode the alternative wave of the time to a good degree of success. This album sold very well and they even headlined their own tour. The three big hits are here,(anyone who listened to 90's radio knows them), and the rest of this is quite good also. Good tight jams, good production, and an overall party vibe make this a fun listen. Enjoy."
3,Decent straight-ahead adventure fantasy,"I liked the wizard protagonist, and his sidekick apprentice is neat since he keeps rambling as he speaks. There is even a non-human character who turns out to be sentient, and rather critical of what has been going on. This was a fun book that reads quite well, with a few grand elements with powerful magic included. I found it satisfying as light entertainment. This is the starting book for a small series called ""After the Spell Wars."""
5,Works as it should for my HP printer,"Although it's annoying that printers don't come with the USB cord these days, I was able to purchase it along with some other things to get good super saver shipping with Amazon. Glad to do my shopping with a discount!"
5,Wicked Funny,"This book was fantastic! I could not wait to see what Clint and Lyle would plan next. Poor Clint could not lose for winning. lol A must read for anyone who has ever worked in an office enviroment, especially cubicles. This book had me laughing so hard I had tears running down both cheeks!"
2,Excellent for students who need a pen drive at university,"This product is Amazing, it lets save your clases and listen music while you are at the campus (university). something important to know is that when the battery is discharged it doesnt work well has a pen drive until you take the battery off; then it will work. it doesnt charge the battery but i wanna try with a rechargeable one to see what happen."
1,peice of crap,the only reason i didnt give it a zero was cause i couldnt it was so hard to figure out the controles were hard so figure out it is way to small it took me lik forever to figure out the it was imposible to get instaled or wat ever and the only way to go back lik if u wont to go bak to the home screen u hav to take the battery out and the directions didnt make any sence u need a frikin masters degrey in tecnolgy to figure this peice of crap out
2,This Sucks,The only reason this got 2 stars is because it works. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I bough this MP3 player last year after xmas and I was disappointed. I got my music on it and then I played the music. But when I went to switch songs the mode toggle switch on the side wasn't attached at all(you couln't switch songs) and I had to take it apart and super glue it on the rocker. DON'T BUY IT.
1,not worth the $,"Bought this for my son's x-mas gifts. These players will not load ""protected songs"" even though it was me who bought them online and there stored on my computer. We have 3 mp3 players in our home, all different brands and none of them have this problem. The reason the others work is they all had the ""plays for sure"" logo and they are a breeze to load and use. avoid this macvision and stick w/ a ""plays for sure"" brand"
1,poor buy,"it says in its manual that this mp3 player can play .wma format. But it can't! I purchased songs from Napster in .wma, my new buy shows format error to all the songs! It sucks."
4,Worth the Money,"Ive had this over a month now, and havent had any problems with it. Took me a few minutes to figure out how to work it, but once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy to use. The music plays in the order that you put it on the device, not alphebetically, which i like. Decent sound quality, good battery life. The headphones werent of the highest quality, a little peice fell off of them the first day I had them. Nothing that effects their functionality tho, they still work fine. But for the price, its definitly worth the money, I would recommend it."
2,was it worth the money?,Thats really what everyone wants to know when looking for a product online. My opinion was that it wasnt worth the money or the time it took to get it to work on my computer. Save your money and look for something else
3,???,"Where's ""Hump to the Bump"" and ""Willie Mae""? I hate when people make compilations that do not truly include those sleeper songs that only true fans really know about."
4,Great CD,I'm giving this compilation a 4 because there are a few tracks that I like that aren't included. Other than that this is a great comp by Slave
4,"My ""best of ""compilation would have been a little different","While the tracks on here are classics, The BEST of the Slave jams are the ones that were played at the house parties that the radio stations didnt know anything about. The Stone Jam album is still #1 from beginning to end. And yes Starting Over is the tightest slow jam that we dont get to here anymore:(Kurt and Starr were 2 unsung heroes and integral players in this group and Steve Arrington is irreplaceable. i would love to see them perform again."
4,Almost perfect!!,"This is a masterful compilation of Slave and Steve Arrington!! The sound quality is awesome and the track selections are near perfect. As far as I'm concerned the only track that seems to be missing is ""Starting Over"", which is a monster slow jam!! One will still get to enjoy the funky bass riffs and slides as well as the supreme lead and background vocals of this legendary R&B group."
5,Steve Arrington is the man,"I may be a bit basis because I am a huge Steve Arrington fan. I grew up loving Slave's music and I still do to this day. It was a very smart thing to do adding Steve Arrington's solo music to the CD. After the group downsized, the other members formed the group Aura. The group made Steve's nasty loose string bass in coupled with his voice the key vocal point of Slave's unique sound. I think they were one the best bands of there time."
5,This is it!,"This is one most underated bands in history. My first experience with SLAVE was in 1977. I still have their first album. Yes, album. Now 25 years later I'm still in funk heaven. My personnal favorite, Stone Jam. The bass on that cut is a true funk experience. Any one who was not there and want to know what we funksters consider 'ol school buy this CD, close your eyes, and SLIDE back."
3,the funk runs out of steam,this compilation loses its momentum at the half way point. but as it goes up the hill with songs like 'just a touch of love' and 'slide' it is a helluva ride!
5,slappin funk,"another funky group out of ohio.another wicked self-contained band who could groove and sing.the songs seem like they came out just yesterday like slide,just a touch,snapshot,weak at the knees etc.a must for funk fans on the one."
5,Good size for two people,I was looking for a small spring form pan so I could cook for two. This one is perfect.
3,what is leakproof ?,"I bought this pan because it's leakproof. I thought it's perfect for cheesecake( because of waterbath ). Am I wrong? or I got the defect one. I poured some water in this pan, and water leaked. When I let this pan waterbath, water came inside this pan."
2,disappointed,"First of all, the 3 buttons on the bottom of the actual answering machine are different than what's in the manual. The manual has a message button, a play button and a record message-the toy doesn't. So you cannot record an outgoing message like the manual says.It says to dial any 7 numbers to call a princess--My 4 yr old daughter wants the exact phone number to call them. She doesn't want to just dial anything-she's old enough to know the difference.The most disappointing part...the voices do NOT come out of the handset. She was (and I was too) expecting to 'talk' to the pricesses using the phone like a real phone. My older daughter has a barbie phone that works like a real answering machine and phone and the voice comes out of the handset!Don't waste your money on this if your child is 4 or older-it's too babyish"
1,Franklin PageMark,"This was a very disappointing product. I think it is a great idea - and bought 3 of them to give as Christmas presents. I'm returning 2 because it is useless. The dictionary is way too limited. During my first day of use, I looked up seven words and three were not in the dictionary. All three are readily available in my regular dictionary. All of the resources spent on games, address book, etc. would have been better spent on improving the dictionary."
3,great for young teens,My 11-year-old son got this as a gift and uses it constantly. He looks up words he's not familiar with and plays the word games to increase his vocabulary. We even play together sometimes! I plan to buy some for gifts.
1,Disappointed,My daughter was super excited to have one of these but when we got it the battery was dead. We replaced the battery only to find when it finally came on that the screen was damaged somehow and was not legible. It almost appeared like we got someones throw back. I contacted the seller and they never responded back to me. I ended up ordering a different one which has been great.
4,Heatproof = Handy!,"I never realized how much I needed a heatproof spatula until my mom got me one (a narrower version of this model). It's great to be able to use it right in a pot that's simmering on the stove.The only thing I don't like is the shape of the handle--it's very wide, which I find a bit uncomfortable and difficult to rotate one-handed. I guess I have small hands or something."
1,Watch out!!,I have owned 3 of these (and one of the narrow ones)and every one has snapped in two at the base of the handle with no unusual trauma. Anybody know of another heat-safe spatula out there?
4,It's silcon and it's a spatula . . .,"It's silicon and and it's spatula from pyrex, what else is there really to know?The only problem I had with it is that the head is a little stiff and the one corner is a little sharply cut. The two combined can make for a unpleasant poke if you don't pay attention to it while washing or taking it out the drawer.Other than that, it's a great spatula, just be careful where you rest the handle since its metling point isn't the same as the head."
2,Buyer beware,"I bought this spatula after reading the good reviews for it, only to have it fall apart 4 months later. Pieces of the plastic head are chipping and peeling off, and I don't even use it more than once a week. I washed it in the dishwasher, but it is supposed to be dishwasher safe, so that shouldn't matter. Buyer beware."
1,Poor Customer Service from FunShippedFast,Bought At FunShippedFast and they sent the wrong item.I had ordered face patches as shown in the picture displayed but recieved the set including body patches and one face patch. When I asked they said the manufacturer stopped making the face patch set . But instead of informing me the item I ordered was no longer available they just sent another item assuming that it would be ok. Also their description and picture is obviously a lie and i was fooled. They appeared to have good customer service because they promised to refund half the purchase price which was fair so I agreed.This was 2 weeks ago and no refund yet. So now I am stuck with something I did not want and money wasted.
3,For the Bleach Fans of Urahara Kisuke,"I'm a huge Bleach fan, therefore when I got a new vehicle I was looking around for a key chain so for me this was it. The large key ring is very strong but the other small rings are too light for my liking the rubber is kinda thin but it's ok as long as you don't 'ruff it up' this should last a while, I took out the small rings and added some small key rings just for peace of mind. The product is Legit and looks just as in the pic, therefore as my title reads I would recommend this is for the Bleach Fans of Urahara Kisuke."
5,Watts in a Tank,This is classic rock at it's finest. I've been waiting for this to come out on CD for years! Give it a listen.
4,An old childhood favorite.,Great band from Holland in the early 80's. The music sounds dated but the songs are well done. I think mostly musicians like this one. Sausalito Summernights made a big impact.
1,No support past warranty.,"The USB 9750 lasted about a year and 4 months before developing problems with one of the internal gears. (pretty bad for $1,000 product) The only option that Visioneer offered was 25% off of the purchase of a new scanner. They do not repair their product and do not offer the names of any third party vendors who will repair their product.Keith SummarNashville, TN"
4,GREAT personal service!,I recently bought the two Ocarina song books from Ruthie Bitton as resources for my school's small Ocarina ensemble. While the books are wonderful resources - more importantly was Ms. Bitton's willingness to personally answer some questions we had about Ocarinas in general. She invited us to email her directly should we have any questions or comments and surprisely - she responded within a few hours! What wonderful comprehensive customer service! Now my Ocarina students know they have a professional advocate! THANKS
5,Sunbeam kitchen timer,"Sunbeam TimerThis timer is the only kind I use now. I have gone through many timers, and it has outlasted all of the other timers I used over the years. It is vry accurate, but has a fast/slow adjustmant on the back if necessary. I would recommend this timer highly."
2,works sometimes,"this timer is very finicky. I've figured out how to get it to work for short times but the mechanism and the way you wind the spring is very confusing. It only works about half the time. The other half of the time, I set it and it just sits there. I would not buy this product again."
3,Get what you paid for,"If all you want is a cheap flag to hang on your wall, this one is just fine. It's not made the greatest (a few weirdly colored spots and it's not perfectly rectangular) but for what you're paying, it's exactly what I expected. Makes a pretty cool addition to a dorm wall!"
2,Low Quality,"You get what you pay for I suppose. The flag is paper-thin and pretty much see through. The flag is not properly colored to match the Air Force Flag, but it is similar.I wouldn't buy the flag again."
5,Wonderfully composed!,This cd is absolutely perfect for those looking for a renaissance feeling CD. It reminds me of the music they use for courtly dance at the Bristol Renaissance Faire in Kenosha WI. This CD is my favorate of this type of music in my collection.
4,"A ""must-have"" for new homeowners","This title is less of a ""how-to"" manual and more of a room-by-room walkthrough of every house in America. Wonderful tips about safety, maintenance, and the major systems of your home. Written in a friendly, non-threatening style. The author's recommendations are insightful and practical."
2,Not for everyone,"I found no value in this book. Reading it felt like a chore instead of a learning experience. The way it was written, it felt like the author was talking to her girlfriends at a Sunday morning get together.A lot of reviewers seem to enjoy the book, unfortunately, I'm not one of them."
1,Not very helpful at all,"My husband and I recently bought our first home, so I ordered this book in the hopes that it would give us helpful details on how to maintain it, make minor repairs, and accurately troubleshoot. I am very, very, VERY disappointed in the book. While it gives decent descriptions of the various aspects of your home, such as heating and cooling systems, it does no more than that. I thought I was getting something more in-depth than just descriptions. For instance, how do I MAINTAIN my air conditioner properly? I've heard that you should hose down the outside unit every so often, for example - yet there's nothing about that in the book. I don't feel any more educated about my home and how to keep it safe and well-maintained than before I got this book. This was almost a complete waste of money and I don't recommend it."
2,Is this a novel?,"This book contains very few pictures. Basically it's for novel-lovers, not for handy-man. I noticed most good ratings for this book are from women ..."
2,Book nothing like title suggests...,"This book should have been titled something like 'How Does Everything Work In Your House"", because it does very little toward letting you know what you have to do to maintain one. It's written as if you know absolutely nothing about a house, since the author apparently never saw one before she bought hers. She does an ok job of describing the 'systems' within a house, if you can stand the New York attitude that comes with it, but if you are trying to learn how to maintian your house, you'll be very dissapointed. What's more, she covers only those things associated with owning a house in the northeast, she never mentions the special needs of a home in California, and very little for Florida - two states with very demanding needs for homeowners. And what's most disappointing, is that her solution to maintaining a home is ""call a contractor"", preferrably one from the local country club."
4,comfy,"smaller person. my wife and kids love it. i am too big, I guess i need a full size hammock as I just cannot get comfy.the top ropes are frayed, worries me a little"
3,Charleston Rope Chair,I ordered the Charleston Rope ChairOutback Chair CCH-237 Charleston Rope Chair. The shipping was timely and the chair arrived in one piece with quick easy installation instructions and hardware. The Charleston chair is great! We really love that you can have your legs fully outstretched in the chair like an upright hammock. The chair has thus far had no issues. The knotting of the hammock netting is quite messy and cheap looking and the bar from which the netting is hung is filled with wood filler and looks pretty cheap too but it is strong and that's what counts most of all. I do recommend bringing the chair indoors when not in use as the cotton webbing would surely not last long in the elements.
5,So glad I purchased.,This has to be one of the most comfortable lounges I have been in. Not confining and so much room. Love the fact that you can lay back with feet up and go right to sleep or read a book.
3,Not worth the money,"I have had this chair just over a month and the roping is already coming undone in two areas. Plus, you really can't stretch out completely in it if you are taller than 5'5"""
5,Works great,I needed another power supply. One for work and one for home. This one is still in use and works like a champ. I am definently getting my money's worth
1,Bad Design,"This was our third replacement for my sons scooter. Razor factory was out of the genuine charger, so we went amazon. On our second and third chargers we reinforced the connection between the wire and the plug by wrapping it in electrical tape. Prongs fall out of plug and then the charger is rendered useless. Bad design from the get go. I would pay $50 for a design that would work and last... I have already spent over $90 for replacements thus far, but we're not quite ready to throw away a decent scooter because the chargers are junk!"
4,It works... nothing else to say really.,"It works... nothing else to say really. The product seems to be the original manufacture product, but it is really hard to tell these days."
5,Works,Works well. Plug and go looks like the original one with the indicator light on the plugin part. It just takes a long time to charge.
3,Worked Great... For 2 Days,"This thing worked great for 2 days. If you need it to work longer, you might want to look elsewhere."
5,Great adult-size helmet,"I bought this helmet for an office gag gift and it was a tremendous hit. It fits adult size heads and with a little creative decorating, it really got the laughs. The helmet looks great and the horns are impressive. The helmet looks much better than the price would indicate. I have received requests for more helmets so I will be ordering more."
5,Excellent!,Got this for my husband and he loves it! It fits great. It was a little hard to wedge the horns in all the way but he finally did it and now they stay in perfectly. Did not have to assemble the helmet like some mentioned - just had to stick the horns in. Nice comfortable fit but very hot inside! We may poke holes at the very top for ventilation if it gets too hot.
1,Just a costume,I've already reviewed this once. I thought the plastic bag mailing container was not appropriate. This is for a one time event.
4,Perhaps the most perfect plastic viking helmet ever.,"If you're looking for a gag viking helmet, my friends, look no further. Your search has brought you here, and every moment of my life has led me to a point where I can tell you this: Everything is more fun while you're wearing this viking helmet. Vacuum your rugs with it on. Pay your bills. Romantic evenings. You're wearing a plastic viking helmet. It arrives in four pieces, but you're not stupid and can figure out how to snap them together. The ""horn"" material is made with a realistic off-white color to match that of real bone of a viking kill. The main helmet piece appears to be actual hammered metal. Amazing attention to detail. Buy this, wear it, and then go forth and conquer."
5,Entertainment for everyone.,I bought this for pure fun. Always gets a laugh every time you pull it out. Made of plastic but its fairly durable mines been squished and it pops right back into shape. It's definitly worth the money just for the fun it brings with it.
3,Uncomfortable but usable,"When you recieve the package you will notice that the helmet is actually in pieces, which isnt a big deal. You slip the two horns into the sides of the helmet and then slip on the little furry additions to the base of the horns.Visually, it does its job. Its made of the same cheap plastic that most costumes are made of. My only real gripe with it is that the edge where the helmet meets your head is very sharp. The plastic was cut without any kind of rounding of the edges. It will start to bother you if you wear the helmet for more than a few minutes. Also, once you take off the helmet you will have a red line across your forehead from the sharp edges.Would I buy this again? Maybe, but im leaning towards no.Would I recommend this to a friend? To buy? no..."
4,Just fine,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but it is the exact same product. I wore it to a Halloween party and it served its purpose just fine. It is made of molded plastic and there is nothing in the interior for comfort, but it wasn't terribly uncomfortable for the duration of the night. I wear a hat size 7 1/8 and I had a little room to spare, but not enough that it was falling off."
4,Good Item,"This is a good item for the price. It is plastic and comes in three pieces. Simple to put the things together. It is plastic and edges are a little thin. There was some comments about sharp edges, but it is really you. If you have a full head of hair and thick skin, you want feel a thing, but if you are like me, have a few hairs left and my skin is so thin from years for washing (I am old if you did not figure it out yet) you will notice the sharpness.Hope this review helped."
5,X-CEPTIONAL!,"THIS WAS MY HUSBANDS ADDITION TO HIS VIKING COSTUME ANS I WAS TRULY IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY AND THE INEXPENSIVE COST. THE DELIVERY WAS QUICK AND ARRIVED CAREFULLY PACKAGED; IT WAS A GREAT ADDITION TO THE OVERALL LOOK! THANK YOU WIFE, SGNOIGE/STL MO"
4,Unleash your inner Viking,"Got this as to make gag photos for blogs. It's so much fun for the money. Looks pretty good from a distance. It's of a fairly large diameter so be prepared to stuff something under it for smaller heads, it's more comfortable that way too."
5,Cool helmet,"Exactly as described and quick shipment. I am so impressed with this helmet. Says it is a Costume Party Prop so I was a little worried, but it is wonderful. I got this for my husband as a gag Christmas gift (our local high school's mascot is the Viking) and he is going to love it. It seems extra durable."
5,great fun,Everyone loved it and had to try it on. The horns can be reversed to the down position if a sulky person is wearing it.
1,Not the same,"Very disappointed. Bought as a gift because I had received one a few years ago. Product is not the same, cheaply made, and grinding mechanism is below par and not worth the price. Returning item."
5,great pepper mill,"First I bought the Wm. Bounds tapered pepper mill with the crank on the top. That one was not very good. Kind of difficult to turn the crank, very course pepper, difficult to spin the courseness regulator and the little knob at the top kept getting loose. This one is great, easy to grind, good pepper texture, no top knob movement and comfortable to hold. Would definately recommend."
2,Don't let its rugged good looks fool you,"On the surface this pepper mill had it all... nice sturdy look, large capacity, and an easily selectable grind size. I'll say up front that we cook a lot, so the mill got pretty heavy use. It worked great for about a year, then the plastic parts cleverly hidden beneath the metal top began to disinegrate. It still works, but I'm not sure for how long... and some of what I think is pepper on my eggs may be ground up black plastic. Seriously though, I'm changing brands."
3,Too many options,"Though I agree this is a nifty little timer - I think it would have done better to have fewer options. If I set it without having cleared it, it starts counting up instead of down. This is dangerous if I don't notice it!"
3,NOT Pyrex!,"The timer I received looks just like the picture, except that it is not Pyrex, but CDN. I don't think the quality is as good as the old Pyrex timers used to be. The slider knob on the right that selects between Count Down/Count Up/etc doesn't work well, doesn't have clear stops -- I kind of have to wiggle it , as in fine tune it into position. Rats, I am disappointed. I am using it, but will keep my eyes open for a better option -- that is well built and easily changes between count down and count up. The seller should stop advertising it as Pyrex!"
2,Get a timer that uses standard batteries,"This timer is just a little more complicated than it needs to be. But my main complaint is that it uses a hard-to-find button battery that in my experience doesn't last particularly long.I'd recommend one of the timers here on Amazon that use AAA or AA batteries. They last longer and when you need a new battery, it is cheap and readily available.That said, if you need a timer that can time 4 different things, there aren't a lot of other options out there."
3,Good but very fragile,"Great timer. I liked it while it lasted but one drop to a vinyl floor and it was D-E-A-D.Way too delicate for the average kitchen,"
4,Cute Gloves,I bought these gloves for a little girls tea party as dress up and as their take home party favors. They came on time as expected and they were extremely cute. I can not comment on the durability as the little girls took them home but they appeared to be made very well. I would highly recommend them as for the price (they were a steal).
4,Interchange Teacher's Edition 3 (Interchange S.),Great tool for ESL learners. I'll be using this one as soon as I finish with Interchange 2 teacher's edition which has proved to be a good material. It's a pity it doesn't inlude any audio cd.
1,Stopped working in 2 days,"This charger worked for only 2 days after I bought it.After that whenevr I plug the phone to charger it ,the ph displays a messages that the phone cannot access the storage device!!! I dont know what this means.Please do not buy."
1,Looks cool--but is really impractical,"What a piece of junk!!! Looks cool on my desk, but what the hell? The speakerphone is worthless (can't hear my voice), and you can't toggle between speakerphone and headset!!! For example, you pick up the headset to make a phone call, and you're placed on hold. You're placed on hold, so you'd like to toggle to speakerphone. You can't do that!!! What a piece of junk!!! I replaced my Bang & Olufsen with this, after the B&O crapped out. I'm sick and tired of these products that choose style over substance. I get more use out of my Panasonic cordless. Forget it. If you're willing to compromise practicality and value, go ahead and buy it. I've learned my lesson."
2,Not up to homemade snuff,"We cold brew our own freshly ground coffee all the time, and thought we'd try this as a way to have some concentrate on hand for those times when we've come up short. Maybe it's the chicory in the formulation, but this isn't close to being an acceptable substitute for what we make ourselves. Until we read the ingredients listing we thought it must have alcohol in it for a preservative. We didn't finish the bottle. An extra star for convenience is all it gets."
5,Lots of Cheesecakes,This pan is just the right size for our favorite cheesecakes. The buckle releases easily. The pan distributes heat evenly which helps the cakes to bake evenly. Get several of these pans because you will want to bake cakes all the time.
2,Flaky & rusty,"I expected this to be a great pan based on ratings here and from a well-regarded cooking show. But after only 4-5 uses, it needs to be replaced. Despite the ""nonstick"" surface, both my husband and I have had real trouble getting food to release from this pan completely, and have resorted to soaking it or using scouring sponges in an attempt to get the baked food off. Probably as a result of the soaking & scrubbing, the latch is rusting and the nonstick surface has peeled completely away from the bottom rim of the pan (where it comes into contact with the base) and is starting to peel from the inner surfaces of the pan. For the money, I expected something much sturdier."
1,Paint peels off,"This springform isn't non-stick, it;s merely painted with black paint that won't stick to the product, it does however stick to my cheesecake.See if Amazon will take this back, not using this again!"
2,Rather dissappointing...,"I am a fan of WWII documentaries and this one on the Nazi Concentration Camps was a real letdown. It has a great deal of footage from the camps, but its very poorly organized, and looks like it was produced in the 1950's. The narration is so bad I just turned the sound down - not topical at all and presents no lessons whatsoever. I would highly recommend the PBS series called ""Memories of the Camps"" over this patchwork DVD that looks like it was put together in someone's basement - not any real studio."
2,Know what you're buying...,"It's likely one will find Discovering Your Spiritual Gifts, once it arrives, quite disappointing. DYSG is subtitled, ""A Personal Inventory Method."" Actually, it is a pamphlet-sized questionnaire. The best feature: a bibliography. Wagner's Finding Your Spiritual Gifts is much more complete, costs less, factors in ""subordinate gifts,"" and gives scripture references for his definitions of the gifts. See also, Spiritual Gifts Inventory by Team Ministry. FYI: Both questionnaires assume tongues as a modern, available gift--""non-charismatics"" might find a few questions enigmatic."
5,Excellent resource,"Highly recommended as a tool for confirming or discovering your spiritual gifts. I have taken at least 4 spiritual gifts tests and this one has been the most comprehensive and accurate-there was an area of gifting that I knew existed, but I didn't know exactly what it was until taking this test-the only test I have seen that separates the gift of giving into 2 categories. I never fit the traditional mold because my gifting is geared toward needs rather than the more general and more recognized gift of giving. This is just one example of the thoroughness of the test. There are likely other good ones out there, but this has been the best I have seen yet and worth the time it takes to complete."
4,Req who?,"This album kind of came out of nowhere, at least that's what it seems to me. Warp-Net.com had no mention of it up until it's release, so naturally, I was asking ""Who or what is a Req?""I noticed ""Sketchbook"" in a small CD store downtown and had to pick it up, mostly just because it's on the Warp label. I was pleasantly surprised at what I heard when I put it in my CD player. The first reviewer is very right, it is all very Lo-Fi, kinda muffled sounding. . .but that adds to its charm.There are some really good beats here, and very subtle melody throughout the album. Yes, the ambient works do become a bit boring, but are enjoyable nonetheless.I must say, the big masterpiece of this album would be track number 13, ""Wasp Zither"". It's a very mellow track, the melody sounding of a music box almost. The beat is subtle here, but very heavy, like a heartbeat. It's an emotional song.Overall, this is a great CD, minus a song here and there (hence, only four stars)."
3,ten million years to friday,"since the evacuation of St. Cary the Cornish town died and awaiting final destruction. only one man--a newspaperman--remained behind for the final death knoll. but, what is unearthed from deep in the mines."
5,delightful ancient bronzes,"it is now over 20 years since this exhibit traveled to several museums. a significant number of the pieces can be seen at the cleveland museum or the metropolitan museum (nyc). however, the photographs in the book are detailed and exquisite. they show greek, etruscan and roman small (hand-holdable) bronze figures over the ""classical"" period of five hundred years. as kuttner remarks, there is excellent coverage of time (charts) and space (maps). so the catalog can be used as a primary reference for this personal and permanent form of art. beyond that, as john russell noted in his contemporary review in the new york times, many of the pieces are simply gorgeous."
2,rip off,"Wow, the pepper mill barely works. I can only get very large chunks out of it, and it's impossible to refill. The salt shaker is just OK. If you want to pay less than $20, just go pick something up at Target for half the price. If you want something that works, get something else. I'm so disappointed!"
4,A Survivors Guide to the Suwannee River,I have read the book and find it packed with all the information needed for a sucessful trip. It supplies helpful information about the possible hazards along the river. Much info about camp sites and resupply sites along the riverFor a small book it is loaded with pertinent information and all the phone numbers you might want to call.Nice river pictures to supplement the text.This book has what you need for a sucessful trip and I have just ordered the video companion to the book.
2,Hard to Navigate in Kindle,"I respect the content of John MacArthur's commentary. I bought it in the Kindle edition for my iPod Touch, but was disappointed to find that the table of contents is limited. If I want to look up notes on Genesis chapter 48, for example, I have to scroll all the way through the book of Genesis to get to what I want to look up! I don't know how to suggest that chapters be added to the table of contents of the Kindle edition of this book. It would make it so much easier to use as a reference book. People don't usually read through commentaries; they use them to look up specific passages."
2,A Big Disappointment,"Just to reiterate. This ""commentary"" IS the study notes and Book introductions from the MacArthur Study Bible. Of course they have been ""revised"", i.e. repackaged to sell again in a new format and an enormous font to bulk it up...If you have the MacArthur Study Bible save your money and avoid this ""commentary"". If you don't and are thinking of buying this ""commentary"", spend your money more wisely on the Study Bible instead.I looked forward to a MacArthur Whole Bible Commentary, but this is a waste of time and a disappointment."
3,The Mac Arthur Bible Commentary,I expected more from John MacArthur's commentary. His comments were not indepth and most of them were too brief. I was disappointed with it.
2,Falls Short of Expectations,"I love John MacArthur and have read several of his books and probably listened to 100 of his sermons on GTY,so I thought this commentary would be a good investment. I was wrong,I mean it's not a total waste,but not what I would have expected from DR. MacArthur. It has failed me several times as I would go to look up certain verses and find that the whole section of scripture isn't even aknwoledged,so I guess the whole Bible wasn't worth commenting on? And he does nothing to resolve what seem to be conflicting statements,I had to look elsewhere to find the answers I needed which is odd because I bought the commentary thinking it would be a source of help and not frustration. I don't know who wrote the best Bible commentary you can buy but it's not this one-apologies to Dr. MacArthur."
4,MacArthur's Notes,All MacArthur's Notes from his Study Bible. Nice print. Easy to use. Great if you don't want to spend the money on the study Bible. Reformed Theology.
5,Well Trusted Commentary.,If you are looking for a commentary of the whole Bible from a man who has Godly wisdom than this is definitely the one you want. I have heard John MacArthur speak of being passionate about the truth and seeking God for insight and understanding of the Scriptures and clearly God has blessed him with both.
5,Approved by discerning husband,My husband asked for this book for his birthday. He had heard of it from friends but he is very particular about his books so was uncertain until it arrived. He is very pleased and recommends it highly.
4,McAruther a good writer,"Although I have not used this volume very much, I have read two or three of his commentarieson book of the Bible. I have read his commentary on 1st and 2nd Thess. It was well written,he did not avoid the tough issues. What I have seen of this work strikes as being well writtenand to the point, not avoiding the issues."
5,Great resource,The best of the best! Highly recommended for anyone wanting to dig deeper into the Bible. Dr. MacArthur is the best!
5,John Macarthur the BEST,"THE BEST.As with all of Dr. John Macarthur's works, this is excellent. I highly recommend."
5,MacArthur Bible commentary,"John MacArthur is a very distinguished bible schoolar and teacher, his insight and interpretation of scripture is accurate and biblically based.It is difficult to find these complete commentaries anymore, I was happy to be able find one on amazon from a private vendor."
1,Broke the first time,The first time I used my KitchenAid food chopper it broke. I was chopping onions and the top broke off. KA's small kitchen tools have proven to be of poor quality to me.
4,handy little machine,"Great machine to take traveling, my brother cannot chew regular food and this is handy to take anywhere, restaurants, ball games, concerts, etc. anywhere an electrical plug is not available."
3,"So-so, I suppose","I had high hopes for this product. It's definatly not as good as I expected. I had one of these years ago from some no-name company and it worked great. After years of use and abuse, it finally broke. So I replaced it with this, thinking it would be better because it's KitchenAid. This is difficult to take apart after using-I feel like I'm going to break it. It doesn't hold very much. It's also a pain to clean, almost impossible if you don't clean it IMMEDIATLY after you use it. I used mine to chop garlic about 2 months ago and it smells like it still. In my opinion, it's just easier to use a knife."
1,Junk,"This chopper does a poor job, with a fine line between chopping and pulverizing, and takes way too much effort to chop a reasonable portion of most vegetables.A complete disappointment for onions and bell peppers. A knife is almost as fast, yet effortless. Of course, the human ability to rationalize any decision they make leaves one wanting to say something good about the product, but this thing really is a piece of junk."
3,Compare it to a small food processor,"I have a small food processor and am not happy with the size of its chopped food, which are always too small. I thought this chopper can turn up bigger chopped food, since I would have manual control. Well, I found that the size of the chopped food are not that different from a food processor, and I really have no control over the size.A small food processor can also do things a chopper cannot do, such as grinding up meat.This chopper is smaller and lighter than a regular small food processor and therefore easier to store if storage space is limited."
1,Not a good chopper!,"Again, another KitchenAid product I got hoping for quality (because it's KitchenAid, it SHOULD be QUALITY!) and thouroughly dissapointed. It really is hard to take apart and put together and does a very poor job with the actual chopping, which is what is it's only function. My Mom has the original Pampered Chef chopper and it's a dream! I was hoping this one would be just as good. It's not. Do not buy!"
3,not what i expected,"I had another chopper before this and that was great. Lasted for more than 2 years before the blade wore down. I got this because it looked better but it didnt serve the purpose i needed it for. I hate to chop cilantro and parsley because i like it finely chopped and cant manage it that well with a knife, and this chopper wasnt all that great. It would not evenly chop and would never get to the bottom layer of whatever i was chopping."
2,Falls apart,"This worked fine the first few times I used it. The plastic part that moves around as you chop keeps food from sticking to the side of the clear plastic chopping area nicely. However, after using it only about 5 times, the top ball came off, and it doesn't go back on. So technically it still works OK, but without the ball on top to cushion your hand it's a bit painful to use. An ovenmit will also work, but let's face it ... for KitchenAid, you should be able to expect more."
4,contemplating canines,"A collection of 43 brief ruminations about dogs from literature and philosophical works. This book is very-- for lack of a better word-- ""French"" (if you've ever read any 20th century French philosophy, you'll know what I mean), and is recommended primarily for those who love both dogs and fine literature."
2,Great while the non-stick lasted.,"This pan is one of the best ones I've used for cheesecakes, however, after several uses, I found that the non-stick began to peel off. For the price, I did not expect this. Perhaps, it was just a fluke, but for the next pan, I will try another brand."
2,Poor quality shorts...,Dont buy think DVD. It doesn't have good short films. Some of them are exptremely boring.
3,Fairly good italowestern,"I am not very keen about Italian (here Spanish money, too) westerns, but this is quite a good one. It is not terriby bloody which makes it more palatable. Of course, there are killings, but they are not just because of blood and gore. Some italowesterns do not care much about the story, but here it flows well. Heflin and Roland are simply great, but George Hilton (Jorge Hill Acosta y Lara)was not up to others. He had also funny English voice. Klaus Kinski, well, was Klaus Kinski. Do not watch it if you want to improve your mood!"
1,Fantastic western movie with suspense and excellents features!,"Well this movie have all ingredients to make it a classic western. I think that the the ambients and avaricious from these four mens, make a semi-terror and really suspense around the movie and the features, special Klaus Kinski make the spectors really sense several situacions, like panic until melodrama.Its a really Western classic."
3,"Pan great, no supporting instructions","Cake pan is perfect, but arrived without a picture of the finished product to follow as a guide, and no instructions as to how much cake batter to use."
5,Great Cake Pan,fast service great product I bought this pan as gift for my sister to make my nephews 1st birthday cake she is having fun baking and learning how to get it right before the big day
4,Gotta love Elmo,I made a smoosh cake for my daughter out of this cake pan. It was my first time so I made a practice cake. If you haven't made a cake before then I would definitley practice. Line the pan with flour and shortening. Don't be shy with this either. I only eneded up frosting instead of the stars since that would have taken hours. It still looked great.
3,Needle too wide,My problem with this thermometer and the pyrex instant read thermometers is the needle is way too wide. This makes it impossible to get an accurate reading. The needle itself covers almot 20F in range.
1,Waste of Money,"This thermometer quit after about three months. It always 350 whether it is in the oven or sitting on the kitchen counter. I wrote to Pyrex about it, and they said that they did not make oven thermometers. I looked at the back of the thermometer and it is made by a knife company. Pyrex must only make the glass for the window. So now I am out my purchase price."
1,Pretty but.....,"I tested this in two ovens, both set at 350 degrees. After taking forever (15-20 minutes) to reach its maxium reading, the thermometer read 275-285 degrees. I hope Amazon reads these reviews, because this item shouldn't be sold. (I would send it back but I want to use it as part of a windchime.)"
1,I have to agree try another model,"I have an older oven and the temperature fluctuates in it. I currently have 2 different themometers in the oven just to verify that Im cooking at close to the right temp.I used this thermometer for about 3 months, then I opened the stove one day to find that the needle was stuck on 325 degrees. I tried to get it to unstick by shaking it and putting into the refrig to no avail"
1,Never accurate and finally broken,This Pyrex thermometer was never accurate. It was always off 20 to 50 degrees. It finally broke 6.5 months after I purchased it. And I didn't use my oven every night. I relied alot on my crock pot and pressure cooker.
2,"Awesome system, tape is toast in a month","My initial impressions of this system were very positive, and I still think the gel is a great product, but after 300 miles and a month of use, the tape started to curl up at the edges and got a slick, smooth sheen on it where I normally rest my palms. The tape feels great, it has great tooth, breathes well, and is just junk.My advice is to buy the Fi:zik gel system without the tape, and use Torelli Moda Chunky tape for a really great system. My riding partner's Moda Chunky is 3 yrs old and still going strong. For us, 3 years is over 10,000 miles."
4,Great wrap,"This totally cuts down on the road vibration during rides. The gel inserts make a big difference over double wrapping my bars. My only gripe is the price. Even though Amazon has the best price on the net, I hate spending this kind of money on wrap tape. Having said that, it is worth spending a little more for this stuff."
2,Mr. Gasket 3678 Starter Motor Heat Shield,"Mr. Gasket 3678 Starter Motor Heat ShieldI have another heat shield set-up and after buying this type and trying to get it installed I can't give this a rave review. :0(#1 The heat shield is way to close to the battery cable terminal and getting to get to the connections with the shield installed is a real pita.#2 When tightening the small ear that holds the shield in place at the solenoid, the aluminum tab spreads open and is not tight enough for my liking plus I fear it could vibrate loose and then what?Every installation is different I know, if your not afraid of re-engineering the shield then this is for you.I took some pictures and you be the judge.Thumbs down on this one.RagenRat"
4,Straight-forward and does what it should,"Not top-of-the-line, but better than stock by a long shot. Even a brand new truck would benefit from replacing their stock stabilizer with this unit."
2,Sent it back,"This a nice screen but when I got and went to carry it, the screen self-rolled out about 5 to 6 inches and would not stay retracted. I returned it."
4,It works for what I need it for,"The tripod projection screen arrived in a box that was fairly mangled, but the contents were OK. The legs seem a little flimsy, and it has 2 plastic buttons that concern me some. However, it seems to work well enough for now. Only time will tell if it is more durable than it looks."
5,Great Book,"I can't wait for the next book in the series. This book has helped me getting away from the Evangelical Christian nonsense they call Truth. Especially the first two chapters of Genesis and its absurd contradictions and myth, were entertaining and eye opening.A person needs to read the Bible like any other book. Don't overlook the obvious fictional accounts it gives.And try to answer this: How can a God of Love put conditions on his Love? And when is True Love based on threats? What kind of Father does this to his children?"
4,Very good cookie sheet,"I've had no real problems. The only time something went wrong is when I sprayed some non stick spray on it. Because it has such a highly non stick surface already, everything would slid off the sheet when in the oven. So my advice is to not use non-stick spray with this cookie sheet. Otherwise, it works great when I remember not to spray it, LOL."
5,Good. Distributes heat fairly evenly.,"Paid $11 for this on Amazon. Needed a new cooking sheet. Glad I got this one... good size, and distributes heat evenly. I recommend it."
3,Pay attention to the price of this item,"On November 19 I purchased two of these cookie sheets directly through Amazon with super saver shipping included. They were $5.99 each. Please note what they are selling for now, not even through Amazon, that is almost $24 each. These are barely worth what I paid for them. They will warp immediately. I knew that when I bought them (because I owned and discarded one years ago), but I am hard on cookie sheets, and usually end up using them to control drips in the bottom of the oven. Yes, they do go in the dishwasher, but as one other reviewer noted, they will get water in them, so you have to drain that out. You will be very disappointed with this item if you pay the current price."
5,allmusic.com to Serge,"Information Superhighway is fabulous. I searched on allmusic.com, under ""instruments,"" for baritone saxophone players and learned about Serge. One word, wow. He has his own euphony, now I have to buy his Serge Chaloff and Boots Mussulli release."
5,Bari like it's supposed to be,"For a long time I was frustrated as a bari player. Gerry Mulligan just didn't do it for me. Serge Chaloff, on the other hand, is one bad mofo. This is definitely the type of sound I've been looking for. This is a really great album. Every note sounds perfect, and Philly Joe Jones is such a great drummer. Nobody else swings that hard."
3,Tiny Lunchbox,I bought this Yankee lunch box for my husband who is a huge Yankees fan. The lunch box is tiny and made more for an elementary school student who carries a very small lunch.
1,It couldn't be any worse,"I bought 7 of these pans back when they had a huge sale. These are in no way commercial weight steel. They are thin and very flimsy. The nonstick coating also appears very thin, like it would scratch off very easily. The sides of all the pans are uneven and dented. You can get much better quality, cheaper."
5,Made In USA: Music From the Original 1986 Motion Picture Soundtrack,"If you like SY for there ability to take you somewhere with a story instrumentally with the occassional obscure vocals, then this album is up your alley. It is as if you are driving through the desert in your unair-conditioned car, looking for an adventure. Very abstract. This album is not for you if you like powercords verse-chorus-verse chorus."
5,Excellent Product,I have arthritis and I love this product. The 3 velcro closures are excellent. They don't pop open. I will order this again.Lucy from Michigan
4,So Far So Good,"I have been using this brace for about a month, and though it was MADE IN CHINA, it has been quite effective thusfar. Moreover, it is purportedly made of 80% neoprene and 20% nylon, so lead does not appear to be an issue. I was not at all pleased with the $8.00 shipping charge for something that weighs next to nothing, however. And when I complained, the seller gave me a $4.00 shipping adjustment. So far so good."
5,The movie rocks and i want a cope of this!,"Please, if this is the book from the movie Labyrinth I would love to have my own copy of it. This is the best movie ever made. So please find a way to republish this book."
3,This is not a reveiw I just have a question,"Has anyone heard of a book called Creatures of the Labyrinth or anything like that?If so, could you give me it's title and author.I'd really appreciate it.Thanks! -Beth"
5,Put the Passion Back into Teaching,"Rethinking Language Arts: Passion and Practice is a fresh look at the ideal classroom. Nina Zaragoza provides real world examples to go with her philosophy; she lives the life of a teacher. She allows the students to guide the mini-lessons and structure of her classroom. Every lesson is authentic. She holds high expectations for everyone, and everyone experiences success. Nina addresses everything from writing journals to spelling tests. This book puts the enthusiasm back into the hearts of teachers."
5,Don't read this book...,"Don't read this book if you don't want to be convicted of God's awesome power, of the need to 'go ye into all the world', and of the relatively powerless life most American Christians lead. The testimony of Joanne Shetler was an inspiration to me. My God is much greater than I give him credit for being. I intended to merely skim this book as research for a novel I'm working on, but the story compelled me to read every word and then read it--prayerfully--again.Deborah Raney, author of A Vow to Cherish and Beneath a Southern Sky"
4,"Wipes are great, but Amazon description is wrong.","The wipes we received were not in resealable packages as the description and even reviews state. Amazon customer service was great and they quickly replaced the wipes, but the replacements we received were exactly the same; they were not in resealable packages. Just thought we'd share our experience in case you actually buy these to use in their resealable packages and not as refills (which is the only thing they can be used for). I personally like the scent of the regular Pampers wipes, but the scent of these wipes is not bad."
4,Packages NOT Resealable,Great wipes but the product description is wrong. These are not the kind of packages you can throw into your diaper bag. They must be put into a dispenser or at least a large ziplock bag.
5,Great wipes at a great price!,These are my favorite wipes. I have used these on my kids for almost two years and they smell and feel great. They are a great deal on Amazon (especially if you have them on subscribe and save).
3,Not as advertised,These wipes are very perfumed and do not come in resealable bags as advertised. They made my baby rashy and I just don't care for them at all. I am sorry I purchased them. 3 stars because they do wipe well.
2,coping with elders,"Although there are some good points in this point, the overwhelming view seems to be that the younger folks have to continually sacrifice their self esteem, personal values, and integrity to coddle an elder. There are some folks who are mean and nasty all of their lives and seem to get worse as they age. The tactics do not work on these people and they are quick to tell you about ""your tactics"" or demean you for trying. Don't fool yourself that this will work 100% of the time.Too many self help books with quick fixes and trite responses"
3,great ideas for rich people,"There are lots of great suggestions in this book for people who can hire other people to deal with their problems. If you can hire a housekeeper, home health aide, AND a care manager, this is the book for you. Or have the money to place her in a $5000/month care facility. It will help you figure out how to get your cranky mother to accept this stranger into her home instead of you having to be there yourself. However, if you are like many of us who are trying to figure this out without unlimited cash resources, this isn't going to be much help."
4,very insightful when first learning about this process,"I was so grateful to find this book. It was one of the first I started with when trying to come to terms with my conflicting emotions towards my parent. The book helped me realize, I am not alone. Although, I wish it had more examples of what can be done without bringing in outside help. Some of the parents aren't ready for that, some of the adult children don't have the funds for this outside help and truthfully, the state is almost always OVERWHELMED with case loads. That being said, thank you for the acknowledgement of those of us out their who love and sometimes hate our situations, but we keep going. Don't dismiss the advice in this book by any means if there is any way you can get it. Thanks again to the authors."
2,Frustrated,"I am unhappy with the book since it appears to be more instructural than information based. I was looking for a book that would provide me with information about the elderly verses a text book style that I don't have the time to analyze. I also found the book a little dated 1994, there must be more current information. Shipping time was extremely long also."
3,Compassionate - Insightful,"Using real-life examples, the authors address compassionately many of the real-time problems caregivers face. You might find your parent and help for your problem in their stories.While I am not in favor of the pop-psych labeling-people-approach that leads people to think of themselves as diagnosticians, I do find valuable insights in this book. Ignore the labels, use their advice.Phyllis Staff, Ph.D.author, ""How to Find Great Senior Housing""and""128 Ways to Prevent Alzheimer's and Other Dementias"""
3,Book is a recap of material already out there,The book really didn't offer much that I hadn't read many times over on relating to difficult people.While it emphasised the point that you shouldn't feel guilty about not giving of the time or activities requested it didn't do much more than say you shouldn't.Shouldn't wouldn't couldn't aren't really solutions.It left me with the impression that the requests of these people were alway the result of manipulation or control when I observe that it is the regression to childhood and the fear that mommy (the trusted person) is going to leave them.
3,Get another book too,"(...) Get the real truth about the fraud and abuse of the elderly and not so elderly. To avoid a guardianship in the State of Florida, and other states, should be of paramount importance. Find out how to protect yourself and your loved ones with alternatives: health care surrogate, durable power of attorney, mediation and more. Consider that if you leave your parents to fend for themselves, and ignore the deterioration associated with aging, a guardian can gain a guardianship over them and their assets, without informing you. That guardianship will nullify the most meticulous of plans. To really cover your aging parents, make sure they create a ""Pre-need"" guardianship and name someone they trust, this is the only way predators in the retirement homes will not be able to force guardianship on them. Also create an irrevocable trust."
3,It's like my own Mother was interviewed for the book!,"My brother sent me the link for this book on Amazon, we could not believe the outline - that was our 89 year old Mother who has been stressing all of us out! It was very comforting to know we are not alone, and the suggestions in the book helped to support what we were doing and try to not feel as guilty. After all, with the difficult older parent, it is all about guilt - and them! I suppose it's rather mean to be comforted in the fact that other people have as difficult a parent as we do, we thought our Mom was unique. The strength in numbers, and having an actual book to validate the steps we are taking to care for her, and our feelings. I think it will be a Christmas present for my three brothers."
4,Helps Smooth your feathers!,"To our parents we are their ""children"", not the adults we have become. When they become child like & demanding/difficult we don't want to parent them but that is the role we are put in to anyway. Always see yourself as an adult, don't revert to the child & fall into their PIT of shame & blame. The main thing is this book will teach you that your difficult parent is not going to change & most likely get more difficult so prepare yourself & make sure you don't lose yourself in the process."
4,Perfect for our situation,I ordered 5 copies for myself and my brothers and sisters and we all found information in this book to help us cope with our difficult Mother
5,Excellent book that makes you think,"This book is a quick read and has much that makes you think, and remember things you knew and maybe haven't thought about. It helped me through a rough period when a loved one's spouse passed away and their emotional state made them quite difficult to communicate with. The change in the dynamic has been good for both of us, and I know her emotional state improved because she felt validated, as the book discusses. I've recommended it to friends and all have thanked me because they also found it useful."
4,Practical & Helpful,"This book is very easy to use as an aide in dealing with difficult aging parents. It starts with a questionnaire which helps categorize what type of difficult person you are dealing with and then has chapters dealing with each category. It includes lots of real examples and gives tips as to how grown children can best deal and cope with the different situations that arise. It also includes an extensive Bibliography for further reading. I recommend this to those who are having a hard time with their aging parents. (It does not address dealing with alzheimers though).--Karen Arlettaz Zemek, author of ""My Funny Dad, Harry"""
4,"You're their child, but not a child anymore.","Great book to learn you're not alone in this situation. Step by step you see why parents react the way they do, and how to react in full empathy to their requests. Requests are not demands, something some parents have to learn.And, as a plus, older parents can read this book to see how their behaviour is perceived, and how they can change into being a less difficult parent.Recommended fully to everyone."
4,Spot on,A lot of real life information. Chapters 3 and 4 described my mother-in-law to a tee. A lot of good suggestions on handling interactions and keeping conversations productive and moving forward.
4,Somewhat helpful,"This book is pretty good for what it does: it gives some advice to anyone who is dealing with aging parents who are of certain difficult personality types. I especially like how the author focuses on the fact that it is important for adult children to remember that they do not have to assume the roles they once had as children. She specifically outlines how to respond to some frustrating manipulative parenting behaviors. In this respect, the book is a reminder that one can control previously automatic responses to difficult parents. The drawback to this book is that it is more anecdotal than I had hoped. What I would recommend is getting this book - if you have a truly difficult aging parent - in conjunction with Joy Lo Verde's Complete Eldercare Planner. That book is more practical and complete in dealing with the practical stuff that can be really stressful (finding longterm care, talking to your parents about care options, financial considerations, wills, etc...)."
1,PLASTIC - NOT Stainless Steel,This Salt and Pepper set is made of plated plastic!!!!!!I'd assume the internal mechanism of the pepper grinder is made of metal but this set is going back to Amazon. This is the ONLY case I've ever come across where Amazon's description falls far short of reality.
1,False advertising,This was the 2nd set I tried to buy that were supposed to be brushed stainless steel but really are just plastic with a coating to look like stainless steel. Very cheap feel to them. The title of product is very misleading. No where in the description does it say they are plastic with stainless looking coating. I didn't notice the reviews when I purchased I was kind of in a hurry. I wish I would have looked because I see others said the same thing. Shame on Amazon. You can't leave customer service feedback for them either like you do with other sellers.
3,Okay Set,"I've had the set for about 6 months now. This set is not made of stainless steel, more like a stainless steel covering and is now bubbling up around both the salt and the pepper. I was hoping this was a set that would last more than 6 months! Now they look cheap and are beginning to flake."
1,looks good but doesn't work well,I thought for the price that I was getting a good set. They look good but there is no way to adjust the pepper mill. It hardly grinds at all. So disappointed and wishing I hadn't thrown the box away so I could return it.
5,Wonderful explanation about the Angels,"Many people have asked ""What do the angels have to do with the bible? "" Sure we see shows like ""Touched by An Angel"" and we hear about people saying they have guardian angels...but what does the Bible say about Angels. This book answers that question and elaborately discusses every acute angle about angels the Bible discusses. Definately a must have for every christian wanting to see what the Word says about angels."
1,preaching overcame interesting subject,"This book was so heavy handed with preaching that the characters, story and scenes were completely overwhelmed. It made what could have been an interesting story dull."
5,Superb,"This is my type of 60's CD --- all original versions, great quality, balanced selection from the period. It would be nice if all of the CD producers followed this example."
5,"Creative, Fun and Soulful!","I work with children throughout the country creating plays addressing diversity and discrimination issues through Fringe Benefits, an educational theatre company. When I heard ""Spin Your Web"" I was BLOWN AWAY! The songs tell storiesso imaginatively ... and with so much humor, love and wisdom! Both my students and my friends' children LOVE singing and dancing along. Mary Kaye weaves thoughtful, soulful... life-affirming themes throughout the CD. It's a MUST HAVE!"
5,Another hit for Mary Kaye!!,"Once again, Mary Kaye provides kids and parents with music they can both enjoy! This CD is another hit!!"
4,I'm not really a drummer.,I don't play drums that much when I first received the pedal I wasn't to happy with it. It felt like my stock Pearl pedal. I have felt cheaper pedals feel and respond better then this one. But I have see other better drummers on my set just kill with this pedal.
4,"Fast,powerful",but a two edged sword.Has a tendency to hit you on the back stroke on the shin.I wish they would bring back the Ghost.
2,A few problems with this one,"This is a great looking muffin pan, but it didn't fulfill its nonstick promise in my experience. The muffins I baked stuck to the pan so that the bear details were unrecognizable once I pried the muffins out of the pan.There's a recipe for mini-bear cakes included in the package, but the recipe is stated in metric measures which don't translate very neatly to US measures of cups and teaspoons."
3,"I never thought I would say this, but H.R.'s vocals are not up to par.","I am as big of fan of the Bad Brains as you're going to find, going back to the early 80's. In fact, to this day, the best show I have ever seen was the Bad Brains in 1984 in San Francisco. So, when this release came out, I was totally pumped and picked it up the on the release day. Unfortunately, this CD just hasn't clicked for me. As others have said, it's almost as if the band is trying to make one record and HR is trying to do something else. Lyrically, it's what we would expect: Religious undertones and positive messages. On the punk songs, the music is fast, although somewhat sloppy. The production by Adam Yauch is decent, although fairly straightforward and simple. The vocals, however, are 2 or 3 tempos below the music and there are heavy effects on the vocals, including delays up the wazoo, which just get silly. In one way I respect what the band is trying to do, but they just don't seem to mesh with one another."
2,A disappointment,"I was a huge Bad Brains fan - I against I was one of my favorites albums way back when.This album, in contrast, seems lifeless. Even on the harder, faster songs, it justsounds like they are going through the motions, and have lost any fire or passion in theirmusic.Maybe I just didn't get what they were trying to do, but it's hard to believe that this is thesame band that recorded their classic albums."
1,The Big 3,"There are three things you should know about the Bad Brains before listening or not listening to this album. Those three things are Rock For Light, I Against I , and Quickness which are all essential to any comprehensive music collection. I think there are two kinds of music, good and bad. Sadly, this Building a Nation falls into the bad category. It sounds like a band that has lost any form of relevence or cohesion. The Bad Brains burned bright when they were a band, as a revival they just don't cut it."
2,Not their best.,"The music still carries a punch, but the vocals are weak. I can't tell if its poor production or HR isn't pushing his vocals. He could lay-off the effects on the vocals; it detracts more than it adds. I suppose that this is a good effort for a reunion CD. However, they could do better. If you want their best, get ""Rock for Light"", ""I Against I"", or ""Banned in DC""."
4,methodical relentless SKILL!,"this album is BRILLIANT. straight up. my favorite parts are when the music is mad chaos and h.r. is singing (yes singing) over them using lots of delay and reverb. many people are complaining about the vocals, but i have to disagree, i think it adds a layer of (for lack of a better word) mysticism to the tracks. i'm giving this 4 instead of 5 because honestly, i hate reggae music. ALTHOUGH, for some reason, on Build a Nation, it doesn't bother me at all, and i find myself actually getting into some of the tracks. So, even though i could really do without the reggae elements and would rather have more hardcore, i still love this album. great job guys, i look forward to seeing you on tour!!!!!!"
2,Eh.,"After a dozen or so listens, I'm pretty much convinced that I will never truly 'get into' this album. Compared to hardcore/dub-littered classics like Bad Brains, Rock For Light, and the archetypical Black Dots, this simply lacks the raw, punchy energy that made them so revolutionary (not to mention entertaining)in the first place.H.R.'s legendary vocals are afflicted with similar symptoms; indiscernible, low in the mix, and effect slathered. I wouldn't call it a colossal failure of a comeback, as their have been far worse - it just doesn't measure up, and certainly lacks relevance today.Hell, the best Build A Nation offers this time around seems to be the reggae. If the guys chose to reamp their I Against I sound (which I've never been a fan of, even), they'd probably flip a few more wigs than 'resurrecting' a sound that has been built upon and revived with relative consistentcy for the past 20 some years."
4,criminally ignored,originally found this in a bargain bin. it's a fantastically cool song to sing along to. Kind of girly punk type stuff
5,Easy to use; an excellent addition to your kitchen!,This pyrex candy/deep fry thermometer is terrific. I was a bit wary that it didn't look like the traditional candy thermometer but I took the plunge and bought it anyway...boy am I glad. The design is MUCH better than the average thermometer. It clips to the pan very easily and there is no risk of it falling into that 300 degree oil. I also liked the fact that it isn't like the usual thermometer which can sometimes collect steam inside and make it impossible to read with the condensation. This is a really handy little gadget and I would highly recommend it!
1,very disappoined,"I was very happy to find this candy thermometer at a very good price, so I try it as soon as I got it but just in case it did not work I also used my candy thermometer that I already had it costed me about four dallors, well I have to say this candy thermometer didnt work at all ,I could not read it it only move a little it just wasnt a good product at all I have come to relay on amazon.com for just about every thing that I need to buy this is the only thing I have bought from here that I was unhappy with and I well contiue to buy from amazon.com, thank for being here."
1,Awful!,"This thermometer sat well on the side of the pan but doesn't work as the function its meant for. I just did a boiling water test. After 5 mins sitting in the boiling water, not touching the sides or bottom, the temp sat around 175* while the other 3 thermometers I was testing were at 200* to 210*. Now its in the trash."
2,Yea.. it works... but...,"Yea.. it works... but... you're going to bake, what... 3 cookies on it? The only good thing about it is that it fits nicely in my toaster oven. Other than that, it's not worth the money."
2,Whimsical but Slight,"Stories that reimagine fairy tales, stories that take odd surrealistic turns, and yet these felt slight to me, not fully imagined, but abandoned."
1,What a horrible book,"My son had to purchase this book for a class at school. He read it and I read part of it, it was horrible. I have never read anything that off the wall in my life. I can't believe that a teacher would require this book for a class unless she is showing the students how not to write. The context in this book was suitable for anyone under the age of 18. I can't believe this book was ever published. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
3,Good for what I wanted it,"I bought it to make myself a Urahara costume for halloween, it was very creative with a green nurse scrub and my black graduation toga. Price was a little Hi."
2,"good shoes (4-5 stars), poor service (1-2 stars)","My boy has wide feet (8XW), and, when we couldn't find his normal Buster Browns, these worked great. Good shoes.However, the service from Amazon was subpar. We initially ordered size 7 and found that they were much too small (even though, in the BBs, he was in size 6XW). We returned them to Amazon only to discover that, not only did we have to pay for return shipping, but we also had to pay the initial shipping costs that were initially waived (SuperSaver Shipping). Through a number of correspondences, we were able to have these shipping charges waived, but I don't think Amazon's policy has changed. Save yourself the headache; go to some other shoe site (which I'm not allowed to mention here). These sites usually have free and effortless shipping in both directions. Such flexibility is important when buying shoes.Chad"
4,"Clear, concise financial information and stratagies","Mr. Naylor strikes a chord with the financial novice. 10 Steps to Financial Success provides clear, concise explanations of financial investment vehicles available to investors in every income range. In addition to the expected discussion of these investment options, there is also a wealth of common sense stratagies that can be implemented by virtually everyone to organize monthly income and expenses.When followed faithfully, these techniques can help the reader develop an accurate financial profile. This in turn, supports realistic goal setting and ultimately promotes optimal financial growth.Inspite of the fairly dry nature of financial topics, Mr. Naylor does an admirable job of presenting the information in a vibrant manner. Complex issues are discussed in 'plain-english' and each chapter includes a review section that summarizes key learning points.There is quite possibly a better introductory financial text somewhere, but I haven't read it."
3,Not impressed,"The book shipped on time, but, unfortunately, I'm not impressed with the quality of the book. I would not call it's curled corners and worn pages ""light wear and tear."""
2,"Nice, but not very durrable","When I received my set of Mini Springform pans I was very excited. I couldn't wait to get started on some wonderful deserts. And as expected the results were great. Only after the first washing did the problems reveal themselves. Not only did I notice rust on the release hinges, but the rims on the collars were warped. At first I thought I could live with this, but a friend pointed out it could only get worse. I am used to purchasing top quality kitchen equipment, but these definitely do not make the grade. Admitedly the results of my first time use were great, but I just don't feel these pans will last. I hate buying something and knowing I will have to replace it soon. And that is exactly the way I felt with these pans."
2,Don't bother,My hinges also rusted on the first washing. They look awful. It was a waste of money and time b/c now I have to find a better set.
1,Mini Springform Pans.,"Bought as a gift for my wife, she makes a lot of cheesecakes that the two of us never finish. I thought it would be great to be able to make smaller ones, less waste. The quality of construction on these springform pans are very dissapointing. The top edge is rolled sheet metal and on three of the pans the edge is not rolled over all of the way. This creates a sharp edge that not only can cut fingers but also causes the sliding metal of the spring action to catch and jam, making the release very ineffective. Great idea, horrible execution."
2,Poor quality!,"I bought these last year, and they held up for the first few months.At first i thought they were adorable, but after about 10 months, the paint on them started to peel away from the sides! I was horrified when I saw ( after baking a batch of cheesecakes for Sale) that the sides had pieces of black paint 'baked into the side!!I would stick to Wilton pans the next time, this one is cute at first, but could get you sued in the end!"
2,Hard to Assemble,"Though these work well in terms of baking with no leaks, it is quite a task to attempt to close the springform pan again properly. It doesn't work like a normal springform pan (at least any that I have used) where you can simply place pan around the circular base and close. Every time, the base will flip up sideways or the top portion will close and just slide right past the base, not gripping it at all. I find that I have to close it halfway, then take the based and slide it inside the pan from the top for it to grip it and close the rest of the way. Because of this defect, I really can't recommend these pans."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!,"I was pleasantly pleased with the Kaiser mini sprinform pan. I made mini cheesecakes and it was easy to get them out of the springform pan. Also, they are easy to clean, I am a very happy customer."
5,Mini Cheesecakes!,"I bought these so I could bake a variety of different mini cheesecakes for Thanksgiving, and these springform pans did not disappoint! The non-stick worked great and afterwards I just tossed the pans into my dishwasher and I was done. I am very hard on my pots and pans, but these are holding up very well so far. I have only used these once, but I see them lasting a very long time."
4,An Autistic Life,"This is the autobiography of Lucy Blackman, an amazing autisticwoman who has made remarkable progress in adjusting to theworld despite her autism. Facilitated communication and auditoryintegration therapy play major roles. What I found particularlyvaluable (but at times hard to understand) were the insightsshe gained into her own difficulties when she saw changes as aresult of these therapies and techniques. This book is hardto follow at times, but worth the effort for anyone trying tounderstand autism."
5,Great coffee,"I thoroughly enjoy this coffee. It is strong enough to make fabulous latte or caramel macchiatto. I love to grind my own beans for the freshest coffee. This coffee is not even slightly bitter, but has a wonderful beginnng, middle, and after taste."
4,"Tasty, and great bang for the buck too!","At the low low price I got these beans, I am floored! I'm almost a fresh bean coffee snob too. Great gifts to break the bag into smaller offerings!"
3,Okay Coffee -- I Would Buy Different Brand,My first taste impression of the coffee is that it is not great.I like dark coffee and this is pretty mild.
5,"Very chilling, realistic portrayal of Alexandra's dark angel!","I do not own this film, but my history professor wisely showed it to my class in college. In Russian with English subtitles, I found this picture to be the most historically accurate, especially with the inclusion of Rasputin's most loyal women follower and conspiritor. This films shows Rasputin as an animal with unconquerable lusts. This is a must see for any person who wishes to know more about the myth from the man!"
3,Grounded yet flying high,"As you know now, this book is composed of two sections: Fletcher's indoctrination into the Army and his flight school training; then his flying time over Festung Europa. I have to give the book only three stars for the following reason: out of approximately 500 pages, only the last 200 pages were devoted to his flying experiences in wartime England. The first 300 pages described his experiences while learning to fly in California, Arizona, and Oklahoma. This portion of the book grows on you, but it's not really what I wanted to read. However, by the end of the 300 pages, you have a good idea what it took to learn how to fly in the early 1940s; and you learn to appreciate his training experiences when he finally enters the European theater of war.The last 200 pages were a compilation of his diaries and input from various flight crew members. This section, of course, was much more readable. Therefore, I wish there had been more to read."
3,"Not the best, but good looking!!!","This pair of Rocket Dog's are pretty dang cool looking, however the comfort is lacking a little. For the casual wearer, they are fine, but if you are on your feet for many hours of the day, you will start to feel that in these pairs of shoes. The quality feels like they are not the best, but I will come back to they are a good looking shoe. I give it five stars for looks, three stars for comfort, and three stars for quality. These shoes were true to size."
4,This Adapter is Great!!!,"The AC Adapter for GBA is Great! It saves a lot of money on batteries if you play your GBA a lot. The cord is long, and the adapter doesn't get hot for hours. The prongs fold into the adapter so you don't hurt yourself when you grab it. Now my sister and I can play as long as we want without worrying about wasting the batteries. We don't have to use batteries unless we go on a trip. This is a great buy!!!"
4,"Great Product, but can break easily","This AC adapter is good for infinitie life! Saves your money on buying bateries. The only defect is that the snap piece on the DC Module broke off on mine in less than 2 weeks! Otherwise, it is good for infinitie life."
2,"its ok, but uneaded.","whats wrong with you all? why dont you just buy a battery pack that you charge and can take with you, or you can just plug it into the wall and just play there for infinite power. Still, its ok if you never go anywhere,right?"
5,A necessity if you have a Game Boy Advance.,"This is the most important, money-saving device you can get if you don't want to run to the store for batteries every few days. The way it works is it comes in two pieces. One piece goes in the battery compartment and replaces the battery cover, as well as the batteries. The second piece, the adapter, has a piece at one end that plugs into the first piece, and the usual box that plugs into an outlet at the other end. The unit has a sleek design that stands out, so you don't accidentally unplug the TV or something. The prongs on the plug that go into the wall fold in so you don't jab yourself in the hand when you grab it. This is a necessity for die-hard gamers or people who hate to change batteries all the time."
4,Good For some,This is a great item to buy if you will be spending alot of time playing your GBA. If you don't plan to play your GBA that much don't get this. After all the GBA will last for 15 hours with 1 set of batteries. It works great and the cable is pleanty long.
4,Love it.,"I bought it in ""Ice""(white).Lether quality is not very good, but not too bad.(It's very thin)I like it anyway because it shows off very good on me."
5,Best grappling hook for the money.,"First off I have to say I'm in love with the black diamond grappling hook, it's size and weight are ideal and the durability of the hook is unmatched. The hook fits into your palm perfectly and honestly brings me back to when I was kid pretending to be Batman the style and fun of the hook isn't a fly by it's a must have if you're a serious climber and kid at heart."
5,A must have classic for everyone who sews tees,"Yesterday I sent my husband to the library to borrow Marci Tilton's Easy Guide to Sewing Tops & T-Shirts. Ten minutes after I started reading it, I logged onto Amazon and ordered a used copy for my sewing library. I'm a solid, experienced, intermediate level sewer who loves to sew tee shirts, and I found a great deal of helpful information, some of which was new to me. So I completely disagree with the reviewer who thought experienced sewers wouldn't learn anything new from it.The clearly written and well illustrated section on altering patterns to assure a perfect fit was especially valuable for me. I only wish I'd read this chapter earlier this year when I made half a dozen muslins to fine tune the fit of my basic tee shirt pattern. I eventually got it exactly right, but having this book would have saved me a good deal of time and effort.I understand Threads is republishing this book in January as part of a combined set. It's a true classic."
2,A disappointment,"I was expecting a valuable guide to making tees and other tops when I bought this, but it doesn't contain much that isn't in other sewing books. It provides instruction on such things as how to select a pattern and using clear elastic ensure a close-fitting neckline, which are things an experienced sewer would already know. The illustrations are good, but otherwise it's pretty unhelpful. It might be a good reference for a beginning sewer, but I find myself rarely reaching for it for guidance in constructing tops."
5,Very solid sight reading book,"While the organization of the book might be lacking the material inside is quite strong. The dedicated sight reader has many avenues to travel through rhythmic exercises, varying difficulties in solo lines and repertoire selections. I personally enjoy the duet and repertoire sections. A fine teaching tool and great asset to singers learning to sight read."
3,OK- not issues,These are nice low cost strobes that work well. Best when used in small venues. You will need 2 or 4 to light as they do not have as the light does not carry more than about 20 feet.
2,Bulldozer Songs,"My son loves this video, but there is a lot of gratuitous explosions and very little educational value. He has other construction related videos that are better suited for his age."
4,Where do balloons Go?,"A good down to earth book, death seems acceptable. It was loved by a four year old."
3,"Like ""I Spy"" with a clever poem","I usually give 5 stars for children's books that I like. The illustrations in this book were way too busy and in my opinion deserved a 2 star drop. I love stories that rhyme but, they must have a certain rhythm. The rhythm in this wonderful story is completely lost when you have to turn back because your son wants to see every little thing from 2 pages ago. It's like an ""I spy"" book with a clever poem which is completely overshadowed."
3,Where Do Balloons Go: An Uplifting Mystery,"I enjoyed ""Today I Feel Silly"" so much and looked forward to ""Where Do Balloons Go"". I was disappointed. I feel the pages are way too busy with illustrations. If you are reading and showing pictures to the very young this is too much for them to see."
3,"Great, clever concept - artwork too busy for young readers","Fun and light, the story text is appropriate for most children. The illustrations, however, were very busy. Perhaps this sparked greater imagination, but the buried detail was lost on the young readers and won't hold their interest like many other books that will be read time and again. They did, however, like the stickers that accompanied the book.I also ignored the real world ramifications, that the balloons kids let go will probably end up in the bellies of fish in the ocean. I worry that more kids will let their balloons go based on the book, which is not the environmentally appropriate behavior I would want to teach. Most zoos and aquariums will have exhibits of what is found in animals' stomachs. Balloons are usually there.Marked down for that last aspect and the artwork. A fun and light read."
5,Jamie Lee Curtis ROCKS!!!!!,"I wish there was a way to promote her books more. I bought one of Jamie's earlier books for a little boy a couple years ago. Recently, I was very surprised when his Mother said that it was the only book he enjoyed reading and wanted ""Where Do Balloons Go?"" for a birthday presnt. This little boy doesn't read very much but spends a lot of time in front of the television or computer, so it was very uplifting to know he realized there is more to life than visuals."
2,too abstract,I think this book is too abstract for a child. Children enjoy a simple story. I didn't agree with the others who thought the pictures were too busy. Children enjoy nice illustrations and it gives parents plenty to talk about and discuss. I also didn't know what we were supposed to do with the stickers in the back of the book. They didn't seem to fit with any of the other stickers to make anything. Plus you could only put them on the one back page of the book.
3,A Good effort by a Great Band:,"These guys are great at what they do & continue to get better with each album, just check out there newest record ""IV"". My problem with this one however is the mood, energy levels, along with everything else all blend together. They hit it right on the head with about 5 songs but the rest are just the same song just slightly tweaked. Can't say I don't enjoy the album, but it becomes real repetitive real quick. And on a side note for anyone who like these guys you gotta check out the band Westbound Train."
4,Fun Reggae/Ska,What do you get when you mix the best of early reggae and ska with the J. Geils Band? Well in my opinion that's the Aggrolites in a nutshell. Lead vocalist Jesse Wagner better have a chat with his mother about his parentage. Because I think his father may be Peter Wolfe. But anyway...this band is a lot of fun! Especially live. I recently saw them open for Flogging Molly on the Green 17 Tour and was very impressed. Too often opening bands are just...ok. These guys had the room rockin' and warmed up. And that's what you'll get with this record.
4,aggrlites review,"I am always open-minded about anything from hellcat records so I picked this up. Not a bad cd. Definitely party music. I would prefer them to drop the use of what appear to be synthethizers or something and just stick to basic instruments. That being said, they definitely know what they are doing. Good reggae played well. Standout track is definitely ""free time"" although most of the others are decent too. If your into hellcat style reggae, you probably won't go wrong by picking this cd up."
3,Let down,"The self-titled debut from the Aggrolites is quite stunning. This follow-up was a huge let down by comparison. The songs sound uninspired and don't have the same soul-filled punch of the first album. It sounds like they rushed this album through the studio with less care and thought into the music. The supposed ""bonus track"" is the biggest joke of a song - it's basically listening to eighteen and a half minutes of a metronome. The same beat playing for more than 18 minutes. Hopefully this band will bounce back next time, they are far too talented."
3,Reggae from White Dudes,"Sounds like the reggae parts of a sublime album. Perhaps a little more hardcore (reggae-wise) and with less hookage. Decent background music but will never beat a Lee Perry, King Tubby or Trojan Records Compilation in terms of authenticity and sheer ability to nod heads. Worth borrowing."
4,Alone Iin the Dark 4: The New Nightmare on GBC,"this is one heck of a horror game, but even though its on GBC, it still provides a good scare, this may be so, but it dosn't match that of Gaiden.Its almost completely indentical to its Playstation counter-part. So here you go, my review on Alone in the Dark.Story: like the PS1 version, edward carnby is investigating his friends death, and this leads him to Shadow Island, with him is Aline Cedrac. Thats all there is to touch on here, so I'm going leave it there.Graphics: absoloutly gorgeous, the textures are smooth and colorful. The pre-rendered enviroments look better than ever, too.sound: The digitized owl hoots sound great, and the weapons are decent.Gameplay: The fire fights are action-packed, but the exploration can be frustrating, nothing that flaws the experiance as a whole.my conclusion is that this is a pretty neat game and you should definatly check this out, its preety sweet."
5,"Rock Instrumental Classics, Vol 4: Soul","Awesome, I received my item in a very timely manner. I enjoy all the songs especially "" The Horse"" which was one of the theme songs in my high school band and the entertaining "" El Watusi""."
2,"A very poor selection of real ""Soul"" Instrumental Classics...","This collection of Soul Instrumental ""Classics"" is certainly quite eclectic... But a really poor one.It has more than one Booker T. & The MG's, fine, anyone who loves Music may accept to have more than one theme of that amazing music combo. But in the other hand, it has nothing from the Great ISAAC HAYES (what about ""Theme from SHAFT""??... Or ""Theme from THE MEN""???...), nothing from the Commodores (in my opinion, Commodores' instrumental 'MACHINE GUN' is a 'Should-Be-Included' tune), or even Kool & The Gang's 'Summer Madness' ...This record has some interesting tunes, but without the above mentioned, I wouldn't spend my money on it!"
3,Not sure if it is applicable to an average investor,"One of the main, repetitive advices is this book is to talk to the CEO or CFO of the company whose stock you are going to buy. I am rather confused how that is possible for an average investor. Since I am not yet in the same league as Warren Buffet or even Mr Fisher, I found much of the book's advice useless to me.There are some good points though (not paying attention to trailing P/E too much, not being obsessed with price of the stock, Cost averaging, not selling a winner to take profits, etc.) which make the audiobook useful."
2,Disappointing,"I have also played some of these works and know that the brass section in these recordings just aren't characteristic fo the NY Phil. They tongue extremely hard on areas that are supposed to light or chorale-like and it ruins the music. Also, some of the interpretations in the Symphonic Metamorphosis are quite contrary to the style of the piece. This recording just isn't the one you are looking for. The one you are looking for is the London Symphony recording with Abbado on a DECCA or LONDON label. That is the one to get."
3,Memorable...but disappointing...,"Four CDs' worth of memorable moments from recorded comedy in the 20th Century. It can't help but be disappointing, at times, considering the breadth of material that could have been included, but one unforgivable flaw is that the CDs are simply not filled to capacity. (One disc is barely fifty minutes long, for example). Considering the asking price ..., this is inexcusable. That said, many great comics are represented (Lenny Bruce, Reiner and Brooks, Tom Lehrer, W.C. Fields, Shelley Berman, Spike Jones, Abbott and Costello, Allan Sherman, Bob andRay, Bill Cosby, George Carlin, the Credibility Gap and Steven Wright), as well as good to middling material from lesser lights. The liner notes (in the form of a mock newspaper--again with the chintz) are OK."
3,Kind of ok but could have been wayyyy better.,"I finally got a used copy of this (it's out of print now) and I agree with the other folks that this could have been so much better. No Rickles (even tho Rhino has done Rickles releases, ""Hello Dummy"" come to mind),no Tomlin, no Winters, no Berle...Lots of major omissions. And the newspaper ""booklet"" sucks in a big way. That said the stuff they did include is pretty decent overall."
2,Oneida Raffia 4 Piece Measuring Cup Set,"The measuring cups are clearly marked and easy to read. But, the handles' edges are not rounded down or smooth to the touch. It's a minor inconvenience but noticeable nevertheless. I'd spend a little more and get a rounded handle next time."
3,Not appropriate for all bed rest situations,"This video includes a number of exercises that work your ab muscles. If you have a condition for which your midwife/OB doctor doesn't want you to work your abdominals while on bedrest, this probably isn't the video for you. If you want a video for just arms and legs, I recommend googling the on-line bed rest video by Dr. Cathy (websited is called ""Educated Pregnancy"")"
3,This book comes in 2 versions!,"Please note that this book comes in 2 different versions which both came out the same year. If you click ""to look inside"" you will get the $38 version which is in color. The $16.99 version is all in black and white except for the cover. Black and white would be fine, however the pages are exactly the same only printed in black and white. What I mean is that the parts that were once in color are now in gray and are difficult to read. Even the main text which is in black is unclear. Content-wise the book is very enjoyable, but beware of low-quality printing!"
3,Metolius Super Chalk,"The chalk I got was super clumpy. There was hardly any fine power in the bag. Also, it doesn't seem to last very long. I have had zen lizard climbing chalk before and prefer that to this chalk."
3,Purchased for deadlifts.,"I bought this a month or two ago to use while deadlifting. First time I've every used chalk. It has helped the hands, but not what I expected.I definitely like it, but will be trying something different next time."
4,Fair chalk,"I've never used any other chalks to compare, but this does what it's supposed to. I'm not sure if it is because I have particularly sweaty hands, or the chalk isn't very long lasting, but I need to re-chalk my hands every few minutes. It stays on long enough to get through most of any routes, but I have to re-chalk more often than my friends with natural chalk. However, despite it being short lived, it still does what its supposed to do for a pretty low price. I would recommend this for most climbers."
4,works nice,this chalk works much nicer than the chalk i was using previously. sticks on my hands and gives nice grip. lasts longer on the climb than the chalk i was using before as well.
3,good fun,"Die-hard Tom Petty/Mike Campbell fans will recognize ""Diamond Head"" and ""Penetration"" from previous concert footage/recordings (albeit bootlegs). Alright, I admit that's why I bought this. However, I'm hearing the other items for the first time and I admit I like ""Mr. Rebel"" and ""Wipeout"" should be easily recognizable. Sticker on outside of CD promises all lyrics included (in an INSTRUMENTAL album) -- all in all, good fun."
5,If you only purchase one surf album ever...,"... then this is the one to get. Not only does the disc have all of the obvious classics like ""Wipeout,"" but the more obscure tracks from the first explosion of surf music in the '60s. But it's not all reverb guitar cliches here. There's a diversity of style, evident in the 4/4 rock stylings of ""Surfer Stomp,"" the lush orchestration of ""The Lonely Surfer"" and Dick Dale's penchant for Middle Eastern melodies.The CD also features a very well-written booklet about the emergence of surf music, providing a great introduction for groms, surf neophytes and even jaded big kahunas. Well worth the five star rating!"
5,A Fun Surf Collection...!!!,"Put on your swim trunks, get a nice tall drink, and set your clock back to about 1962...!!! These are fun instrumentals...classic rock instrumentals that everyone that claims to be a rock music enthusiast or expert should be required to know about. Complete your education in rock & roll...get this album and surf the memories....!!! Wipe out!! Enjoy!!"
4,Old Rhino collection still the best..,"on the market at least. Hey Rhino how about a two disc set of Surf instrumentals. While most of the essentials are here there are a few missing. And as some of Rhino's other surf collections demonstrate there are some re-found classics (including the tunes from Pulp Fiction) that now need to be added. Oh well, until some movie soundtrack or commercial sparks the interest of the general public, we geeks will have to wait.l"
2,A good record book for the first year.,"For my first son I found such a complete book that records memories until age seven, that I wanted the same for my second baby. However, since it has been impossible to locate, I found this book which I think is O.K. No doubt is more complete than many I have found in my search, but I think its title is misleading since it says ""A record of your early years"" and it actually covers only the first year. Also, I think there are sections completely unrelevant (for instance too much on the grandparents instead of information to complete about the new baby). If you are the kind of person who would like to record in detail the physical and social development of your child, this is not the book to buy. If you are looking for a book with very nice illustrations for the first year, then it is o.k."
2,Baby: A record book of your early years,"While the illustrations in this book are lovely, and there are many wonderful categories that will spur a parent to write rememberances of events that might otherwise have been overlooked, I ultimately did not keep the book. The main reason: it is written strictly from the mother's perspective. Couples who wish to jointly track their memories of their child will, I believe, find offputting categories requiring mom to relate what dad thought about the child. If that is not an issue for you, you may well like this book."
5,Love this little ladle!,"I love this ladle, it's very cute. When I bought it, I almost thought it was silly, but I've been using it for a few years now, and I find myself reaching for it constantly. It is attractive enough for the table, and also the perfect size for sauces, etc. It's also my favorite way to pour pancake batter for perfectly sized pancakes! It cleans very easily in the dishwasher, and has shown no signs of spotting or rust. It's a keeper!"
3,Instrumentals you never hear on oldies stations,"The songs on this album, with only a couple exceptions, are ones that just don't seem to get any play on oldies stations.My favorite song on the album is ""Apache."" I remember it well from my childhood days. I also really like ""Classical Gas,"" ""No Mater What Shape,"" and ""Wheels.""I think the instrumentals selected for this compilation were good choices for the time period represented. I'm glad I bought this album.I'm going to try to be conservative with my ""stars,"" so that I can reward an exceptionally good album with the fifth star. Please don't think that the three star rating I have given this album means that I didn't like it or would not buy it, if I had it to do over again.Tom"
4,Instrumental Hits from the 60s,"This is a good collection of instrumantal hits -- but there will likely be one or two that you don't recognize. And a few big hits, such as Duane Eddy's ""Rebel Rouser,"" didn't make the cut -- even though lesser Eddy hits did. My big disappointment is that there's nothing from Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass. Since Alpert probably had more top-40 instrumental hits than anybody else in the 60s (""A Taste of Honey,"" for example, was Song of the Year and won several Grammy Awards), something from the Tijuana Brass should have been included. Still, if you enjoy instrumentals from the past, this would be a good addition to your collection."
3,An Okay Higgins Clark Crime Story,The story of Deck The Halls takes place a few days before Christmas.Nora a crime novelist's husband and his employee are kidnapped for a million dollar ransom (That's not much). The kidnappers are not terrible people and I felt a little sorry for them. Nora's private investigator daughter Regan is helping the police. Romance is in the air for Regan.The characters are likeable in this story and the plot is easy to follow. Alls well that ends well. A fun book to read around the holidays.
4,Deck the Halls,"I have read several novels by Mary Higgins Clark, but none by her daughter Carol. They team up to write ""Deck the Halls"", which has Carol's series character, Regan Reilly, and Mary's character, Alvirah Meehan, who has appeared in several of her novels. The novel centers around the kidnapping of Regan's father, Luke Reilly, and his driver just days before Christmas. Regan and Alvirah team up to help solve the crime. The kidnappers follow a plot used by Regan's mother, Nora, who is a mystery writer. This is an enjoyable read, and is recommended for 3-4 hours of holiday fun."
1,Is my face red!,"Oops, sorry...I would hope that I could at least spell correctly when writing a rather scathing review of ""Deck the Halls"". What nerve to criticize Mary Higgins Clark and her daughter and not even spell dud correctly, (which the book was with a capital ""D"")."
3,dragged a little,Although the book moved fast towards the beginnig as it reached the 150th page it seemed like it shouldve already been over.It wasnt suppenseful like most of her other book but you could read it for a good laugh.
3,Iffy,This book was okay... It would have been better if written by only one person because I could tell when the writing seemed to change significantly and that tends to bother me. The story overall was good though. It's worth a chance.
3,Christmas Sleuths,"Regan Reilly (Carol's sleuth) has her plate full just before Christmas. First Regan's father does not meet her at the dentist office. Alvirah (Mary's sleuth) is there with her husband and offers the worried Regan a lift, which she accepts. In the car Regan receives a cell phone call for a ransom of $1,000,000 for her father and Rosita, his driver. This is not all of Regan's problems. Her mother is in the hospital. Alvirah gives her a helping hand. It is Christmas. Regan, Alvirah, and Jack Reilly work hard to unravel this case. This is the Clarks first time to write together. Their sleuths blend nicely together. It is fun read for the holidays. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above the River."""
3,"A pleasant seasonal read for planes, trains & automobiles -","- a holiday book to read while on the way to grandma's house.This Clark & Clark effort is ""Thriller Lite."" It's a familiar and enjoyably airy see-through piece (like Divinity candy:)good - but no real mystery."
3,A bit of fluff !!,"Deck the Halls by the mother and daughter team of Mary Higgins Clark and Carol Higgins Clark is ideal for an afternoons read by the fire.Two private detectives, each a favourite character in the respective writers novels, team up to solve a kidnapping.It's a light,pleasant bit of flummery and, being such a slim volume, takes only a couple of hours to read without any brain strain. The crooks are bumbling idiots and the outcome is very obvious right from the beginning. Another thing that bothered me was the writing style-I seem to remember this speech pattern from my schoolgirl stories when I was a child and it just doesn't suit adult books."
2,a simple read,This is a book that holds ones interest but is nothing very special. It is very slight in substance and size and does not compare in any other way with previous books written by the authors. Disappointing! Barbara B Winkler
3,A commercial gimmick,"Both Carol Higgins Clark and her mother, Mary Higgins Clark are excellent writers and I have enjoyed their books in the past. But this book that combines their detectives into one story is contrived. The characters are interesting and humorous. But the plot never builds. I never felt the danger or the tension that should have been present in a kidnapping thriller.I recommend it to fans of the Clarks but the general public might find it slow and predictable."
1,Deck the Halls,"I have every book that Mary Higgins Clark has written and have been a long time fan. This one was the pits. You knew the entire story before you were even through the first 30 pages. There was no mystery to this mystery. You knew who the kiddnappers were, and why Luke and Rosita were kidnapped. The reason I loved her earlier books was because she gave you clues without actually telling you who it was. It was a challenge to me to see if I could figure it out by the end. There was no challenge to this book at all, just mindless reading. I have read Snagged and Decked by Carol Higgins Clark who can not write at all but is merely riding on the coat tails of her mother's success. Carol Higgins Clark has no talent which shows in this ""joint effort"". Best advice to readers, stick to the books that Mary Higgins Clark wrote by herself, without the influence of her talentless daughter. They are the best examples of her work."
1,Leave No Cliche Behind,"I was looking for some fluff after reading two war novels in a row. I needed a break, and I'd read some MHC books back in the day and enjoyed them. This book is an insult to readers' intelligence. Name a cliche and it's in there along with terrible dialogue, paper thin characters, and a story devoid of suspense. The bad guys are so inept and ridiculous I was tempted to put the book aside several times but thought the story had to get better. It didn't. Save your time and money and skip this one."
4,Beware of rugs and heels,Once again Clark has written a fun holiday story. I epsecially like how the two authors merge their two characters. What a great idea. It really works well and the two characters are the perfect ones to combine. Petey is an interesting character and he reminds me of Forrest Gump when he jumps off the boat to see Lt. Dan. I loved this book. I think the collaboation was a big success.
2,Okay But I Definetely Read Better,I just can't recommend this book to anyone. I have tried find something good to say about this book. But only thing I can say is the book cover is pretty. Sorry Mary please try again
1,Buyer Beware!,"I am surprised to read some fairly high praise for this less than mediocre attempt from Mom and daughter. Perhaps the reviewers are like me and usually find Mary Higgins Clark a good read and do not want to hurt her feelings but come on, this particular book is a dude with a capital ""D"". I am so sorry I purchased not one but two copies. What a waste of time, and money, not to mention the embarrassment of giving an audio version for a gift. So much for listening to certain ""book reviewers"" that was a mistake."
1,Waste of time,"Anytime Ms Clark uses Elvira in her book, the story is written on a level for a teenager. The character Elvira reminds me of the Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys series of years ago. VERY AMATEUR & BORING. Certainly not up to par with Ms Clarks' other works. Dont waste your time, unless you are a teenager."
3,"Good, but I've read better by Clark","I look forward to reading Mary Higgins Clark's novels each time she publishes a new one, but this one was a little disappointing. The story was great, but the reader knows exactly who is behind the kidnapping from the start. I'm one who enjoys the task of trying to figure things out before the author has to tell me, and this novel didn't give me that chance.But, as always, the character development and story line were excellent. The blending of the authors' styles was very smooth --Alvirah and Regan both shared the spotlight and held their own in the story.This is a great book to curl up with on a snowy afternoon and it's a quick read -- you can finish it in just a few hours."
4,Poland's Screen Debut,"Zbigniew Cybulski brings to life the Polish resistance in post-WW2 Poland. Now under the rule of Soviet Russia, Poland becomes the object of Communist militarization and control. A young Polish freedom fighter, along with his compatriots, plot to cause upheavel in the new communist regime in the area. Excellent actors, plot and setting bring this film to life on the screen as one of the greatest ""resistance"" type films of all time. Filmed in Polish, a real treat to hear as well as see."
4,Great looking post-war drama from Poland,"The Bottom Line:Ashes and Diamonds sometimes moves too slowly for its own good and doesn't have the same fascinating mileau that made Wadja's ""Kanal"" so involving, but it's a gorgeous film and if you like history like I do you'll probably find the setting of 1945 Poland interesting enough to make the film worth a look: for patient viewers, there's a lot to appreciate here.3/4"
4,Good practical knowledge for training cops,"I bought this book probably in '87 at Long Beach Uniform. It had good information at the time of publication concering the gangs in the greater LA area at the time. Gang associations, graffiti, turf, activity, and turfs are covered. Crimes known to be done by certain gangs are covered, heredity of the latino gangs, tattos, etc. are both covered and photos shown.Seems like a good informational book with little narrative about what society should do about them. I was surprised I am the first reviewer of the book. I had thought a policeman or trainee would have long ago reviewed this book."
4,in protest of Kirkus review,"I am an ex-student of Dr. Maynard's and have since graduated from the Cal State system. I feel that the statement by the Kirkus book reviewer that Maynard is a ""self described historian"" to be belittling and misleading. John Maynard is a a professor of History and his class on Modern California was excellent (I finished with an ""A"" in the class.) That a History professor would, in fact, refer to him/herself as a ""historian"" is a logical step and this is why it irks me that someone would insinuate otherwise in an attempt to undermine Maynard's work on the Beat movement in Venice. The review fails to mention Maynard has a doctorate in History and specializes in the Beat and Hippie California cultures. Because of this ommission, Kirkus gives Maynard an amateur-WWII-buff type of spin instead of his props."
5,Funky jazz from the land of cheese!,"Even though no longer a band, L.B.C.T. is one of the best funk/jazz/hip-hop fusion bands I've EVER heard. Hailing from Milwaukee, WI, (when they were still together), these guys sucessfully blend the funk/jazz style with somewhat hip-hop influenced lyrics, and BOY OH BOY DO THEY RULE!!! Very unique and interesting, they quickly became one of my favorite bands immediately after hearing them. Both the singer and the guitarist won Best Artist in Wisconsin in both their respective catagorys 2 or 3 years in a row. They are very upbeat, funky, and overall a positive sound. If you have any interest in funky, jazzy, hip-hopish music, CHECK THESE GUYS OUT!!!!"
4,Prop Only,"I had a co-worker who had always wanted one of these, so I got it as a gag gift for her. I did a little bit of research, trying to find one that she could actually use. I figured this would be just a prop, but it said nothing in the description. Since it was just a joke, it didn't matter that much to me so I decided to make the purchase. I don't smoke, so I didn't try it but she took it home & tried it & said that it was not intended for use. Again, that is what I assumed, but you never know. As a costume prop this would work perfectly, just don't try to use it!"
3,Fun but cheap,"I was dressing as Audrey Hepburn from Breakfast at Tiffany's for Halloween so of course this was a must! It suited my purposes well, but it that's about it. It looked cheap and both end pieces come off very easily."
5,Had NO problems with it.,"Absolutely completed the Audrey Hepburn look I was going for! I had read reviews with negative statements, but I had no issues at all."
4,Cheap but it worked for it's purpose.,The silver end that hold the cig kept falling off but a little super glue would fix that..The price is good and worth it for any costume.
3,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this as a prop for photos. I can't even really imagine taking it out to any sort of costume party or anywhere where you could get bumped by holding it. The price is cheep, and the product has been trying to fall apart since I got it. I had to super glue the peices in place so they'd stop falling off while a model was changing poses. But it looks authentic in photos, and it looks nice displayed with the rest of my vintage photo props."
2,Way to big,"Looked a bit cartoonish. I thought it would be small and petite, sort of ladylike, but it was very long. Made it work though."
2,"cheap & plastic, ok; cheap plastic AND flimsy, not ok","Pretty disappointed with this item: the 2 plastic pieces come apart VERY easily, like don't turn around too fast easily. As the item is practically intended to be used like a conductor baton, this is an unsatisfactory situation."
3,It was alright,Mine actually came broken. The silver tip did not stay in place. I ended up super glueing it. Other than that it was nice.
3,need super glue,"This item is poorly constructed. You better have super glue ready. Take it out of the package before planning to use it and make the following adjustments. The silver end keeps falling off. I had to glue it on. And, the cigarette also did not fit. I had to glue it in as well. However, It served it's purpose for the event once the issues were addressed."
3,inexpensive prop,"I purchased this as a prop for a character in a video. It served its purpose adequately.It is a low cost item, and made for costume use not for real cigarette smoking.If you are looking for an item like this for decorative purposes it is fine."
2,"Worked for what I needed it for, but the end kept falling off",I used this for my Audrey Hepburn costume. I added one of those fake cigs to the end. Only used this once and the end kept falling off. Probably would be an easy fix with some super glue.
4,1920's prop,I purchased this plastic cigarette holder to use as a prop for my costume to attend a 1920's party. It was exactly what I was looking for and arrived quickly.
2,Needs an update.,"My daughter is turning 11 soon. I bought this book when it first came out, and refer to it every once in a while. Today as I looked for books for my daughter's birthday, I found that many of the books recommended for her age group are out of print. I was hoping it had been updated, but no luck. Please do one!"
3,Not USAF Weapons School--is't B52 Weapons School,"This watch is incorrectly described and you'll find the same error across the web. Sold as USAF Weapons School, but actually engraving on back and information on watch tag is USAF B52 Weapons School. It's not a generic USAF Weapons School watch--it's a momento of one specific flight within the WS. Anyone who knows about the weapons school or whose family member might have attended will probably be surprised. Not a good choice if you know the program or are buying a gift for USAF flyer of a plane other than the B52. Chase and vendors should better represent the product to avoid returns. Link to same product on Amazon with better views: [...]"
2,P4s last lap.,"Minimum replacement for a 478 pin / P4 you still want to get some use from. It's not my old Abit IS7, but hey, it's cheap. One sound channel arrived DOA. RMA'd. Replacement taking 3 months arrive. No idea what's going on with that, but they're letting me keep (using) the old one in the mean time. Suprised by their flexibility. Nice suprise, for a change. Thx."
1,Hugely disappointed,"After waiting forever for the game to be released, then to find that nearly all the qualities I liked about this series are gone. The graphics look better, but the gameplay is awful, it's slow and Lara is awkward to control, especially when she is carrying a weapon, your practically defenseless. Also, this game was way too easy and over too quickly,(meaning the value relating to replayability and amount of first time play value is poor) the puzzles are too simple and the number of enemies you face is far less than previous TR games. Lastly, If I wanted to play ""Kurtis, Psychic Slacker"" I would have bought it, but I wanted to play Lara Croft, Tomb Raider. I tell anyone who asks to rent it first before they decide to buy."
1,WHATS THE BIG DEAL!!!!,"What is the big deal with wanting to keep pushing back the release date! All the company is doing is trying to make a bigger hype about the game by trying to release the game at the same time that the movie does. This method is all a scheme for Eidos and Sony to make a bigger turnout for the game and make a killing off the little children and overgrown kids, like myself. I love the Tomb Raider series and they could have not picked a better actress to play Lara Croft, but waiting and waiting for the Angel of Darkness to come out is only pissing me off. Not even waitng for the next installment of the Sopronos is this bad. Come on Eidos and Sony release the DANG game and Let us the true Tomb Raider fans get what we have been waiting for and You can be sure that after the movie comes out your product will continue to sell regardless of when it is released."
1,NOT WORTH the WAIT nor the MONEY!,"We, a family of four, are a big fan of Tomb Raider and Lara Croft, but this PS2 game really [stunk]. Throughout the entire game you have to wrestle for poper control of her movements and there's a real lag time for Lara to speed up. We finished the game with big disappointment: too easy, too short, too frustrating. For those who gave 5-STARS, come on, be honest. You gave high ratings because you're a true fan of Lara's body and not the series. How can any game lovers rate this one above 2 STARS is beyond me."
2,It sucks,"When I first saw this game,I was happy that another Tomb Raider game came out.When you first begin to have make Lara get ""stronger"" and it was really hard for me to make sure my jumps were lined up correctly.I think Eidos should've spent a little more time on making this game. And also the game was way too easy to beat.Because I didn't like so much, clearly this was the worse Tomb Raider game I've ever played."
3,"Looks good but,,,,,,,,,,,,",It looks like a really good game but I hate to be the saying this but Indiana Jones is going to blow lara away. And Indy is the orgianl Tomb Raider also remember Raiders of the lost ark?
3,I dont know...,"i recently rented one of the PS1 versions of tomb raider and the controls were very hard to get used to and jumping was horrible. I just couldnt stand it. But this game will have a new control scheme, new moves, and it should be ten times better in everything that the PS1 had to offer since its a PS2 game, which still gives me hope for this overrated series of games."
1,Taking too l ong to receive!!!!,I ordered this game in August and still waiting. I actually bought it for my son. Actually he's waiting.
1,Garbage,Well I have been a fan of Lara Croft (not the tomb raider series) for a while... This is my first Tomb Raider title that I actually play.After more than 72 hours of gameplay! all this game has that is worth any positive comment is the story line...other than that this game is garbage!! I don't know how else to describe it...The stealth mode is useless! the enemy AI is pathetic!! Contra for NES had better AI than this...There are countless Bugs in the game! Slowdown! The control setup for Lara is Terrible! (I can't believe anyone would compare her stealth abilities to those of Solid Snake). Metal Gear Solid 1's control was better than this set up! 100 fold!This game has been in development for 2 generation of titles for PS2. Eidos has no excuse for delivering the fans of this series with such an incompetent effort!
1,Stay away from this mess of a game!,"I love the TR series, but this game is awful. It would be a fun game if not for all the bugs. It does have better graphics than the others, but that's the only nice thing I can say. It's amazing the number of bugs this game has considering how long the game was delayed. I've played demos with fewer bugs. The game will slow down because it's raining on the screen. It slows down other times for no apparent reason. And the control scheme is arguably the worst I've ever played. You'll get stuck climbing up ladders that you don't want to climb and other won't be able to climb boxes that you need to climb all because of the poor way the control scheme is set up. This game is sad, and the manufacturer should be ashamed that they didn't do any better with the extra time they had to get all the kinks worked out of this game."
1,How did this get past the game testers?,"Seriously, trust me when I say that this game is really bad - tons of glitches so far including falling through scenery, opponents who just stand there motionless, etc. and the controls are horrible.....I remember everybody used to complain about the controls on the old Tomb Raider games, but I played it so much they became total second nature too me...the new controls seem so hit and miss and just plain frustrating. It [...] because I was really looking forward to this game, but once again they managed to screw it up.....I seriously wish I could get my money back for this game......Go back and play the first two again instead of this one.......the graphics are good, I'll give it that, but they;ve been working on this game so long they look really dated...."
4,Laura Croft Tomb Raider - Angel of Darkness,"Very fun game. Fans of the series might be put off a bit by the ""real"" elements of the game (i.e. fighting humans in a city)rather than fighting monsters in the jungle. But hey, for 5$ brand new, this was an extremely good deal!"
1,Worthless,"I have played all of the Tomb Raider series. I consider myself above average with gaming control, and this game has the worst control of any of the Tomb Raider games. Laura is slow and delayed in her movements. The days of fast moving Laura with precision jumps is gone. I assume my dog and I would have an equal chance of playing Laura against an advanced foe. I have decided to make a Frisbe out of my CD so I can at least get some enjoyment from the game. I will never buy another Tomb Raider game without a test drive from the store or a rental. The TR5 engine will have be brought back to save the Tomb Raider series, and it will be difficult to get back the people who have written it off. The only people who will enjoy this game are those who have suffered a stroke and have impared motor skills. What a shame to disgrace the best action adventure game of all time."
3,BUY INDIANA JONES INSTEAD!,"Tomb Raider is cool, but way too short and too easy. I beat it in 4 days, and it took me a month to beat Last Revelation. Buy Indiana Jones and the Emporers Tomb instead......... it's what Tomb Raider SHOULD BE."
2,Major disappointment,"Awfull controls, full of bugs, OK graphics, nice storyline. Shame because it could be so much better..."
2,Annoying,"The graphics on this game are amazing. So amazing in fact that the PS2 console has trouble handling it. There is so much slow down during some parts that it becomes ridiculous. On top of that Lara moves horribly slow. So slow, I wanted to toss the game out the window.You know in the previous games, you got some Uzies and a hand gun to start out and you could do some cool flips and shoot the bad guys. That doesnt happen in this game. It's not till I played the game for an hour that I got to shoot someone. In fact it wasnt till the third level that I realized I had a gun.I am really disappointed with this game. The people at Eidos good have done so much better. Do not buy this game if you wish to keep your sanity."
1,Terrible,"I got this game this weekend and it's terrible. Long and frequent load times, Lara is harder to control in this game than she was in Tomb Raider 2. The graffics show little if any improvement from the last PSX Tomb Raider outing . . . I can't believe I've been waiting this long for this game. You would think with an 8 month delay, Eidos could have gotten it right. Don't waste your money."
3,What did they do?????,"Come on Eidos, I was expecting a spectacular game, I've been let down, I played it, but not with much enthusiasm.Tombraiders 1,2,3,the chronicles, and the last revelation were absolutely awesome and challenging. That's what kept me coming back for more tombraider. I don't usually come down on makers like this but you guys put this game off for months before you finally decided to let it go, perhaps you should have debated a little more!!!"
3,Hit or Miss ?,"Very disappointed with this game, controls fidgety, and worst of all, severe lack of enemies to shoot compared to previous games. Plot poor and puzzles easy. Completed the game in 2 days and wanted more....usual abyssmal ending.Camera angles very annoying to get used to aswell. After all the hype,a big let down.I love the TR games and this aint the best gameplay one. Looks quite good tho but bordering on an almost cartoon feel. Get Splinter Cell or something else for your money.That game is realistic and rocks !"
1,Thumbs down,"By far, the worst of the TR games. Glitches and bugs are everywhere and even frequent saves won't save you from having to start over. Important pieces of rooms go missing or the screen turns to grey. Sometimes Lara becomes invisible and you should probably turn down the volume on your tv because when her guns get stuck on super rapid fire, the sound is deafening!I won't bother going into the poor controls. Save your money. Rent this game or borrow a buddy's so you can see for yourself."
3,"a lot better than Tomb Raider 3, but not much","I generally liked this Game a lot. it had a slightly improved control scheme,although it still used a walk button, which sucked! although it could still use tweaking, Lara looks better than ever, I never got to the male character but I'm sure he was fine. the game is buggy at times though, i had slow downs, the game actually froze up once (this i a console not Windows, freezing shouldn't happen!!) and twice when I fell from a great hieght I went THROUGH THE FLOOR. the game was a little easier to get through than other games in the series."
1,Worst game ever!,"I had played and finished every single Tomb Raider game before this one. Loved them. This one, I couldn't go past level 2 I was so annoyed. They changed the whole playing experience, and added delays between parts of the level, meaning you spend half your time waiting...Just awful!"
5,The game is great. why is everyone else complaining?,I think the game is awsome. i dont know why everyone else is mad about the controls. if you play games a lot then the controls wouldnt be a problem. and for the camera angles... just move the joystick to get it at a diffrent point!This game has a great storyline. you get set up for murder of you mentor then you break in to a building go through some awsome traps (moving red alarm triggers and sensitive sound cameras) and then later have to lead yourself through a whole lot of under ground passage ways.Im a big time Tomb Raider fan and i like every single game they made. But this one i would have to say is one of the coolest games ever made. I give tomb raider AOD a 5 out of 5 because it is really fun. I like games to where you can choose your own ending and guid yourself through the game and Tomb Raider AOD is one of thoughs games
1,This game is HORRIBLE,"Ok. There should be a negative 5 star rating just for this game. Graphically, the game doesn't look too bad at all, but the controls are so incredibly f!@#ed up, you can't even play the game. No, seriously, they're that bad. They should have kept their original controller setup, because you were essentially controlling a puppet. With this controller setup, you can't even turn around w/o a fair degree of difficulty. In the words of Mr. T, ""I pity the fool that buys this game."""
3,this game [is bad],"this game is for people,who like traps and long tedious,boring puzzles.right from the start u will need the strategy guide.the enemies r all human, and u start out in the backstreets of paris.if u have a iq of 200 or more u will definately find this a challenge if not downright impossible to complete. maybe nextime they will get it right."
1,Disappointing!,"The game idea has great potential, however the camera angles our disgusting to say and you spend a lot of time fighting them. The controls are slow and has so many bugs in the game that you would think it was made by amateurs. It saddens me to say since I love Tomb Raider DON'T BUY IT!!! your just going to get frustrated and fed up with it. My guess is it was a rush job by then judging from the amount of screw up in it. Save your money its not worth it!!!!!I ended up useing a cheat disk to get round all the screw ups in the game!!!!"
1,wrong type,I thought I was getting a PC game? the description did not say it was for playstation 2? I dont have a PLAYSTATION 2 or othwise.
1,the CD room is not good,"I can not be able still play this CD room, because I received it is not good, but I do not return because is more expensive for me in shipping from Dominican Republic to miami..."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,I got this game thinking it was going to be good.WAS I WRONG!! I got less than 5 minutes into the game and it froze! Turned it off and started again got a little further and it froze again. The controls were a pain and you were not able to adjust them. I want to take it back to the store where I got it. I hope I will be able to return it without a problem. Anyone else have these problems? What a piece of JUNK!!
1,Horrible!,There are countless reviews on this game so I will keep it brief.This game is frustrating and very boring. All Tomb Raider fans should pretend this doesn't exist. Please just navigate away from this page and pretend you didn't see anything.
4,Pretty Good Fun,Like everyone else is saying the controls are horrible. I wish they had kept the old control sytem. Using the analog is a major pain and once in a while you'll climb the ladder just by walking by it too close. I did experience slow down on the roof and my disc did stop once. Other than that and the controls the game is a lot of fun. Good story line and the puzzles make you think. If you're a TR fan I recommend picking it up. I'm under the Louvre right now and cant wait to leave work and go play some more.
3,much ado about nothing,"Believe all the negative reviews you've been reading.I was hoping those were just bashers for no reason and time on their hands, but no. Its all true in the first alley where you start I found myself levitating in mid-air when I should have been on stairs... The roof scene does slow down when you first get there. You move around using the left analog stick, instead of the directional pad and it makes your thumb very sore.You have to position yourself exactly to do most anything.So far its not much fan. There is a chance it can improve as the game goes on... And as you know, there's no TOMBS just Paris so far. Looks nice, you have to use your brain but these minor errors and general difficulty to control make it an average to slightly above average play. Decided for yourself!"
2,Where are the tombs?,"I, like many Tomb Raider fans have been waiting a very long time for the release of Tomb Raider for the PS2. To say the least, I was very disappointed. To keep it simple, there are no tombs, the controls are horendously bad, the game freezes up and has to be restarted, and the game has a slow down problem. Most of these factors could be overlooked if the controls were like the controls from the old Tomb Raider games.On the positive side, the game has great graphics, and has a very interesting storyline. Rent this game before you buy it.I sold mine back and took the loss only two days after buying it. Don't make the same mistake that I did!"
3,Not the best,This is nothing like the original games. The graphics are nice in fact they are too nice for the playstation2 because it locks up all the time. The controls are not that difficult like everybody says they are though. I have one reccomendation for those who like action adventure games and that is to buy INDIANA JONES AND THE EMPEROR'S TOMB. INDY ALL THE WAY!
4,this game is awsome!!,This game is the best of tomb raider yet!! I have been a fan since the begining and this game kicks a$$!! The ending was totally unexpected and the gameplay is great. I definately recomend this game.
4,"Probably good, but what happened to ""Tomb"" Raider?","Well, I think that this game will probably be a great game, but what happened to the Tomb Raider spirit? The original Tomb Raider games were about raiding tombs, jungles, Area 51, islands, and other places to find a mystical artifact that had awesome powers. This game strays away from that idea to join the crime drama bandwagon that took off with the release of Max Payne. Max Payne was good, but Tomb Raider should be different, and now that it's similar, and in my opinion that's not good. If you want a good game that requires you to raid tombs, get Indiana Jones and the Emperors Tomb, not Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness, but if you want another crime drama game, get the new Tomb Raider."
1,YUCK!,A total waste of time and money. Not even worth the time to mention all the pros and cons. Few pros and lots of cons. Save your money.
2,SOOOO BAD!!!,"I am a huge Tomb Raider fan, but was terribley dissapointed! First of all the controls were all screwy. Then they TOOK AWAY LARA'S TRADITIONAL OUTFIT!!! I LOVED THAT OUTFIT! They took away Lara's pistols and added Kurtis or whatever his name was. I don't understand why they did this because it just frusterated me even more. Then there are the camera angles. Oh, boy. I could rant on and on about how the angles... I cant even put it into words. They always changed and moved when you didnt want them to. And Von Croy died! Overall, don't buy this game. Don't rent this game. It is a waste of money and time."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....,"Another boring Tomb Raider game; complete with the same goofy puzzles and blocky interface. Nothing new here, just the same old game with better graphics.As for Lara's ""big guns"", ho-hum. Kids looking to see Lara's barely covered cha-chas will not be disappointed but is that really worth the cost of this game?"
4,Out of the tombs,"OH MY GOD!!!! This is the best Tomb Raider game ever. The grahpics, storyline, and characters are way better. Aside from the controls, its the best. I give this game 5 out of 5 stars. If you were a Tomb Raider fan and got bored with her after the last 3 games, please, please check this game out. I guarentee that you will love this game. Whats so great is there are are a lot more FUN puzzles to solve. The reason why they're so hard is because when you're done you feel triumphant about solving a hard puzzle. Only true tomb Raider fans know what I mean. If you have never played this game before, please. It is so fun and challenging. Thats what makes it exciting. You have a lot more things to do. You don't have to kill every single thing. Theres more to this game than killing and stealing. I'm only 2 levels away from finishing it. No game is perfect and thats a fact, so just deal and look away from the bad things. Have fun! And get ready to be Crofted!!!! Kurtis is soooo cute!!"
3,I waited an extra six months for this?????????,"TRAOD is a new kind of Tomb Raider experience, so they say. The controls are completely different from the old TR games. The new control system is difficult to get used to and is just atrocious. The camera movements can cause control difficulty and are just plain annoying sometimes. The feature of moving between areas (like in tomb raider 4) is annoying because of the stupid loading screens. The graphics are good, obviously on next gen console. Now there is interaction with other characters and choice making in the paths you take and how you talk to npc's in the game. Game would have got 5 stars but the controls are a pain."
3,Dissapointing...but good nonetheless,"This was a very eagerly awaited sequel to the Tomb Raider franchise. Despise the 3 years it took to make it, it flaws a lot. The story is really good and gripping, but has nothing to do with tomb raiding. However, I like the way it reffers to THE LAST REVELATION.Pros:StorylineCharacter interactionGraphicsSound (voicing is perfect and music is great)locations (paris and prague)Cons:GlitchyNo tomb raiding involved (well very little)short gameslow gameplayboss and enemies are all lametoo easyjumping platform to platform is frustratingOverall, this game is dissapointing. But I respect it because its a tomb raider game. If you are a hardcore fan, go get it. if you want to play a decent third person shooter, wait for Tomb Raider Legend which is out in 2 or 3 months. It'll be worth the wait, trust me!"
2,So Much Potential Wasted,"I'm a huge fan of the TR series, and have been playing them since TR2. So, it was with much anticipation that I bought TR_AOD. I brought it home, threw it in the PS2 and expected to be blown away. Instead, I was frustrated and disappointed.The controls are completely different, and Lara isn't very responsive. The game looks better than any of the previous games, but it doesn't compare to other modern console games. Broken hearted, I set the game aside before finishing the training level. It took a repeat viewing of the second movie to prompt me to pick the game back up. I just finished it, and it earns a solid 2.25 on a 5 point scale from me.Specific complaints:Unresponsive controls, bad camera angles, LOTS of BUGS, very linear levels, too easy (I finished with 12 100% Med packs and hundreds of rounds of ammo)The positives:Sound is okay, graphics are decent, the new (stealth) moves are coolPurchase at your own peril..."
2,disappointed,"I have played all the tomb raider games be it on the computer orplay station, but Angel of darkness was very disappointing. Thebugs I can handle , but the controls are the worst. They takethe fun out of it."
2,"Wow, this game is surprisingly bad","I just can't believe it. How could a Tomb Raider game turn out so terrible?The other reviews have said stuff about how bad the controls are and how there are loads of bugs. It's all true, but it gets worse.The programmers seem to have had trouble working out how to make the game challenging. What did they come up with in the end ... make Lara jump lots.They know that it's hard to jump where you want to so they put you in loads of positions where you have to reach tiny targets that are in the middle distance. None of the puzzles are hard to work out, so this game is just about how much patience you have.This game is going back to the store..."
3,"It's not the best, but you have to get it.","Those of us in the know, will buy this game because we must; we are driven to continue the adventure. While this game does have new adventures, it also has new problems. Lara is hard to control in many situations; just wait until you try to turn around on stairs. Lots of code seems to be missing so floors, walls, and characters are missing parts or are see-through. While I'm a bit disappointed in the controls and in some of the villians and gameplay, I am glad it is here and will play several times through."
2,Just plain bad!,Save your money and spend it on TR Legends. I have all the Tomb Raider games and this one is just plain bad. Last Revelations for PS1 has better graphics and awesome gameplay. Angel of Darkness doesn't look good and Lara doesn't move well. The camera positioning and movement was done poorly.Just chalk this one up to another mistake like TR3 for the PS1.
2,"I expected more from Tomb Raider, and more on PS2","My first game I played on playstation was Tomb Raider, I loved it. I played all of them before I played this one. Then, I tried this one even when I heard many bad things from reviews, but still I wanted to see it for myself and they were all right. This game sucked. Many times was too slow (walking in slow motion), it was kind of like Metal Gear (but embarrassing Solid Snake), there were not enough puzzles (and the ones it had were boring and repeatitive), the design was bad, and the graphics I expected more since this was the first tomb raider on PS2 (I liked better the previous games the way she used to move). I miss the adventure like Indiana Jones, and I still remember the other games of Tomb Raider; but this one is forgetable."
5,Stop dising Angel of Darkness,personaly all my friends and i have this game from the first shipment from eidos when it first came out.And i can't see how people are saying this game has got glitches or bugs in it becaus it doesnt this game is perfect the voice acting specially.And for all u people who dont like Lara because of this game get over it because Tomb Raider V11 is comeing out spring 2005 from eidos and tomb raider's new developer Crystal Dynamics (hopefuly they'll make Lara look real instead of like a cartoon charicter) if ur buying the game buy the guide to because this game is really chalenging and extremely hard for new TR fans.
2,Cottage Projects,"I am a huge country and cottage decorating book collector, and I have to say this is one of my least favorite of them. There are a few really nice pictures of cottage rooms to inspire you, but mostly the book is filled with cutsie cottage type projects to do, such as making a bench, and clocks. I prefer books with lots of pictures that I can pick things out of the room that I think are beautiful and worth recreating in my home. I also prefer to find these things at flea markets and antique stores, not make obviously homemade reproductions of them."
2,Very disappointing.,The book had examples of decorated rooms but it also had too many pages devoted to what amounted to craft projects and furniture making none of which I would ever consider making.
5,very nice read,"Not an encyclopedia, but a short book with several easy projects. (I, for one, like the bench) Each section of the book is devoted to an aspect of ""cottage style"" (lighting, fabrics, etc) with a few simple project examples."
2,"Quite a good choice of instrumental themes, but... No full versions included!","Hey Rhino compilation geniuses: What about including edited versions of Eumir Deodato's ""Also Sprach Zharatustra"", and MFSB's ""The Sound of Philadelphia (TSOP)""???... C'mon...!!!!"
4,great!!!,"great moment!!! groovy, soul , pop !!! a great mix for enjoying with friends!!!i like the cover of led zeppelin!!!popcorn is really funny!!!!great sound!!!!!!"
1,"The Seventies didn't ""Do"" instrumentals.","Not much going on here. The seventies weren't good years for instrumentals. Buy it if you are trying to round out a collection. Some of the selections even have words, and vocals. It's that sparse."
2,disappointing collection,"as stated by the person before me, this is a collection of mainly disco and funk and very little rock. Only frankenstein by the edgar winter group is a true example of 70s rock instrumental. volume one and two are far superior to this one and the music is much better. there should have been more rock instrumentals here instead of van mcvoy and brass construction"
3,Check That Title Again,"Many of these tracks don't qualify as ""rock,"" as the CD's title proclaims. In fact, it's closer to funk and/or disco with only a few guitar-heavy songs, one of which, ""Frankenstein,"" is presented in a horribly edited version. Still, a few of these tracks are hard to come by elsewhere, and might be worth the price. All original versions."
2,Good Enough To Fill A Few Gaps In My Collection,"Don't you hate it when you have to buy a whole CD just to get those few elusive songs? That's what I ended up doing with this one. I will admit, the songs I wanted on this compilation were some of the ones that brought the ""Rock"" in the title into question. ""Express,"" ""Movin',"" and ""Sun Goddess"" (the latter track being the main reason I purchased this CD and the biggest disappointment - it's a horribly butchered edit - I remember having the original 45 and it certainly wasn't this version). ""Outa Space,"" ""Jungle Fever,"" and ""K-Jee"" were some pleasant reminders of tracks I had nearly forgotten. But all in all, this particular volume disappointed more than it pleased."
3,Actually they're not that great for salads..,"I had bought these tongs mainly to use for salads. I'll admit they do look nice, but when it comes to salad scooping, especially when I put all sorts of toppings like sliced almonds, craisins, and other little pieces of deliciousness, the tongs aren't as great at picking all of it up. What works best with salad I've realized is just using two really big sturdy plastic spoons, one with slits and one without. So yes, these tongs look shiny and they're great for picking up big pieces of chicken, and yes they've got a good feel to them, but they're kind of small and they've gotten lost in the bottom of my utensil drawer."
2,Not terrible,These tongs are OK but they really do not have a solid feel to them. I get the impression that after some use that the bend is going to suffer metal fatigue and will eventually break. I'd opt for a tong with a hinge mechanism if I had it to do over.
5,Great product! Works great.,"I've had this feeder for about three weeks and am very pleased. I read the reviews before I bought it, so I knew to watch the instructional videos for help with assembly and tweaking the distribution amounts, they are very helpful. I consider myself to be somewhat handy with assembly-type projects, but this one was not out-of-the-box intuitive. The videos walk you through it step-by-step. Piece of cake.I bought a different timer than the one included which has helped a lot. The first week I had it set to feed twice per day which created the feeding frenzy ""urgency"" when the cats heard the motor turn on. Since then I have switched to smaller feedings four times per day which has alleviated that problem.The price tag seems like a lot, I know. But for me, with two cats on a restricted diet and my travel schedule, it has been worth it."
5,I can finally get a decent night's sleep!,"My husband and I are so pleased with this feeder. It works great. It was a little involved when setting up but as long as you read the instuctions carefully, you won't have any problem. We've had it for a couple of weeks now and we are totaly satisfied. Our cat no longer harasses us in the middle of the night for food, and since she cannot self feed, this works out perfectly. She is on a special diet that we buy from the vet and It works in the machine just fine. I love the fact that she can get small portions 6 times a day. We purchased the model with the timer. Love it!!!"
3,Acceptable but flawed,"I have tried several automated cat-feeders, and this one is clearly the best. The optional ""chute cover"" (highly recommended) actually prevents my cat from fishing out extra cat food, and the timer can be set to dispense very small quantities of food many times throughout the day and night. The machine is small and relatively unobtrusive. However, for the price I would have expected a better product. The assembly instructions were TERRIBLE. We could not figure out how to set up the machine until we discovered a video with instructions on the Superfeeder website. Watch that video before attempting to build your feeder! And though my cat food is a normal, small size (Science Diet), it sometimes ""jams"" in the chute/ramp thing coming out of the feeder ... meaning the cat doesn't actually get fed at his scheduled times. On balance, though, this feeder is far superior to the others on the market."
3,"Quite good, but not an answer to my problem","I think this feeder suffers from a problem many others do - simply it's too simple for a cat to figure out where the food outlet is. And if a cat is as stubborn as mine, it will spend countless hours scratching and digging into it so the food will finally start to come out.The difference in-between this one on other ones is that Super feeder is kind of funky, kind of home made looking. So it's easier to come out with some kind of protection for the food outlet and screw it to the wooden stand. I had a few pieces of an old book shelf. I cut them and screwed them in such a way that my cats just can't reach the food outlet. It doesn't look pretty, but, well,... someday, someone, will come up with a feeder that is actually cat-proof."
4,Pretty good with a couple quirks,"Pluses: Works and is well constructed.Minuses:(1) The quantity adjustment is hair-trigger senstitive. There's no excuse for this in the electrical design. How about a multi-turn pot, or at least a usable full turn?(2) What about simple battery backup? If both your A/C power and you are out, kitty starves to death. The supplied timer is clumsy, and a digital one would suffice much better."
4,A premium product at a premium price,"We bought this product so that we could get away for a few days without worrying about someone feeding our cats. The CSF-3 holds enough for at least 3 days for our two cats. The only complication is experimenting with the two mechanisms on it which control the volume of each feeding. But, it is worth the effort."
4,Cat Feeder,"The set up instructions are not written very clearly, but once it's set up, it works great! It was nice to know that Peaches' food would be delivered to her in small amounts while we were on vacation."
5,Wish I bought this years ago,"I love the superfeeder! Monty, my cat, LOVES the regular feeding cycles. It gives me peace of mind knowing that when I cannot be there on time, he will still be fed. Setup was easy following the video links on the superfeeder website. Thank you for this EXCELLENT product! I wish I knew about this years ago!"
2,"Smelly bowl, horrible set-up, overall clumsy","One reason I bought this feeder is that it has a stainless steel bowl (many have plastic). However, the rubber rim on this bowl stinks so bad I had to throw it away. Can't say for sure, but if anything smelled toxic... and who wants that right up against their cat's nose? The instructions for putting this together were some of the worst I've ever seen. Overall, making adjustments to this feeder is very awkward. I would not recommend this feeder based on these issues."
4,Phillips Head?,The slotted screw driver holder (K14) is what I thought I ordered - the Phillips head screw holder was delivered - it works ok
1,"PAID FOR, NEVER RECIEVED.","I ORDERED MY SOMBRA PRODUCTS ON LINE VIA AMAZON. I WARN ANYONE NOT TO DO THIS. NOT ONLY WAS IT CONFUSING, BUT EACH PRODUCT ENDED UP COMING FROM ANOTHER SOURCE, EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ALL SOMBRA PRODUCTS. I WAS OFFERED GIFT WRAPPING, AND SAID YES, PLEASE, BUT THEN FOUND OUT THAT ONLY ONE PRODUCT COULD BE GIFT WRAPPED-STUPID! THEN EACH PRODUCT NEEDED TO BE SHIPPED OUT SEPARATE-STUPID!! THEN, I GOT TO PAY FOR ALL THE PRODUCTS, AND NOT GET ALL OF THEM-CRULE!! I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH ORDERING MY SOMBRA, AND GETTING TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS I CANNOT RECIEVE, OR SEND BACK, BECAUSE I WAS SENT THE WRONG THING, DO YOU CARE???"
4,Great product,"I purchased this cream at the recommendation of my sister-in-law, who like to use natural products. She recommended the Sombra Hot Therapy for my husband's sore back, so I decided to try the Cool Therapy for my ankle and foot, which often swells up since it was damaged in a car accident a few years ago. The Cool Therapy feels really good, and the smell isn't nearly as offensive or lingering as Bengay and some of the other drugstore brand creams. The cool feel lasts for a really long time, and I like that Sombra is made of natural ingredients. I will definitely purchase this item again."
5,Both Sides of Time is an excelent book,"I picked up this book not knowing what it was about, and after reading the back, didn't think I would like it. I was wrong. Once I started reading it, I didn't put it down. This is a great book for kids in junior high, as well as high school. My mom read it also, and she thought it was a great book. We are looking forward to read the other books in the series!"
1,"Well, I didn't like it!","Take every misconception and exaggeration about Victorian times you can think of. Add some romance and murder, and you have this book. When I heard such good reviews about it, I read it, and I know I will be unpopular for saying this but I just didn't like it. If it's good for anything, it's an excellent view of late twentieth century perceptions of Victorian times."
5,A teen who dreams of love in the 19th century gets her wish,"This is an amazingly intriging book of love and hearbreak 100 years back. I absolutly ADORE this novel. I must have read the whole thing at least four times through! The descriptive language paints a realistic picture and the characters come to life! As I comment on the first reviewer from New York, even though it may not seem like it the author IS VERY accurate. Women in the 19th century still had NO power.The female revolution for women's rights had not begun yet. It was not proper for a victorian women to race, it was VERY unbecoming, and even more so to win."
5,A GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Annie, was a great character to read about. You can relate somewhat to how she feels about the situation. I can't wait for the third book!"
4,Not as Great...,"This book is the first in this fabulous series. I actually read the second book first, then came back to read this book. I think the second book, Out of Time, is so much better. In this book, Strat sounds like a jerk! The characters get better in Out of Time, but their are some good parts in this book. If you read this, and you didn't like it, you should still read the others in the series. And if you've only read the others, come back and read this to find out more about Annie and Strat."
4,An Exciting Read,"Annie Lockwood, a fifteen-year-old girl, lives in the wrong century. She dreams of romantic dinners with the man of her dreams that will sweep her off of her feet. Unfortunately she doesn't have the gentelman who could give her exactly what she wants. She has Sean. He is far from her fantasies. When she travels back to the 1800s, she gets her chance at true love. There she meets the guy she'd been dreaming about her whole life. Strat is from the well respected and rich family of the town where their mansion sits. Annie is welcomed to stay with the family, though they have no idea who she really is and where she is from. Strat and Annie quickly fall in love with each other but for how long can it last? She knows that she can't stay there, in that time forever. She wants to stay, but for how long will time let her stay? Caroline B. Cooney keeps the 1800s love and romance alive in this great book."
2,Review,"This book STANK! Not only was Annie annoying, she had a depressing life, and in trying to fix her own, she ruined other's. She was self centered, and how can you like the book when you hate the protagonist! I personally don't prefer romace books, but others may enjoy it as long as you look past annoying aspects. The plot was okay, but my overall opinion is two stars."
4,It's ok,"This is a good book, and I like the idea. I didn't realize it was about such young kids though, kind of weird lol"
5,love it!,this book had me reading nonstop from the beginning- it's like a mini-thriller for kids/young adults.i'd recommend this book. :]
2,Both Sides of Time,"I think this was a terrible book, especially coming form this author. i generally think this author is the best but this book was TERRIBLE. The plot line was okay I guess but there wasn;t oo much of it and it was totally un-reasonable. I'm ok witht the fact that she traveled in time but how she handled the whole thing was totally not real. All in all I think it was a poor book."
2,1995 meets 1895.,"Set in 1995 Annie is your average fifteen year old until she finds herself going back in time to 1895. There she finds her perfect guy and arrives at the time of a murder. Toss in the Irish maid being charged with the murder, a father who has gone through several wives, a sly chaperone and mix well.In all I found this book dull and at times I seriously thought about setting it aside and not finishing it. But I did manage to read through it. I'm slightly apprehensive about reading the rest of the books in the series but I am curious to know what happens to Annie and her friends at the same time."
4,An exciting sequel,"Annie Lockwood, a fifteen-year-old girl, lives in the wrong century. She dreams of romantic dinners with the man of her dreams that will sweep her off of her feet. Unfortunately she doesn't have the gentelman who could give her exactly what she wants. She has Sean. He is far from her fantasies. When she travels back to the 1800s, she gets her chance at true love. There she meets the guy she'd been dreaming about her whole life. Strat is from the well respected and rich family of the town where their mansion sits. Annie is welcomed to stay with the family, though they have no idea who she really is and where she is from.

She wants to stay, but for how long will time let her stay? Caroline B. Cooney keeps the 1800s love and romance alive in this great book."
1,More Shallow than the Kiddie Pool,"I was really looking forward to this book--I'm a huge fan of time-traveler books (Jude Devereaux's ""A Knight in Shining Armor"", among others) and after hearing a friend dote on this series I couldn't wait to try it out.I made it a little over halfway through before I just couldn't stomach another word. Not only are the characters shallow and barely constructed, but their thoughts sound like the words of a four-year-old enamored with her favorite TV show. The story itself--the setting, the research, the plot--have the potential to produce a five-star product, but Cooney seriously fails somewhere between her thoughts and the act of writing them down.If you love Harlequin books, shallow romances, and fuddy-duddy teen novels, definitely give this one a go. If you prefer substance, keep moving! (:--By the way, this is one of my first ever negative book reviews. That, in itself, should be saying something. I feel oddly dirty now. ):"
4,Good book but the author is a bit wrapped on herself,"This is a good book, and gives good ideas. But be prepared for a veritable photo montage of the author, Charlotte Moss. YOu get treated to a huge one of her in the beginnning, but they really rain down on you at the end. Towards the end of the book, when I saw a photo on a page with people in it, I found myself saying ""let me guess, she's in the photo...."" And there she was. Every. Time.This is worth buying but you sort of get a wierd sense of...""its all about MEEEEE"" from the author. Sorry, but it makes me laugh a bit."
1,Winter Doldrums,"Wither House.At a loss for words. Beautiful but boring. Old school that doesn't bring anything new to the table (or the myriad of tables). It'll be on the sale rack soon. If you know people that like this kind of stilted matchy-matchy interior design work, then get it for them. Otherwise it's a snore."
1,"Four ""D's""","I always thought I loved winter until browsing this book. It is full of dull, dreary, depressing rooms. The fourth ""d""--disappointing!!!"
5,Winter house in Aspen,Good ideas. Not helpful for all areas. Book depends on her house in Aspen concentrating on winter. Some pictures will take your breath away.
1,STUFFY!,"After finding this book at a tag sale, I did some quick research on Ms Moss and found several interviews...I like to know the philosophy of the designers I recommend to clients...After reading several interviews and going through her book, I find Ms Moss a very fake, pretentious social climber. Judging someone by the shoes they wear or the napkins one has! She should be ashamed of herself. Even though her writing tries to show that she seems welcoming and embracing it is easy to read between the lines...It is entirely clear why this book wound up at the bottom of a box in a tag sale and I am glad I only spent .50 cents!"
4,Nice brake pads,"I only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I've only been using the product for about 2 weeks. The pads I had on previously were also very good, but my son who was using what used to be my bike, finally got another bike and wanted the pads back (he put on last fall). So I purchased these after reading the customer reviews. I don't notice any difference in any way from the previous pads; actually very similar. Which is to say they are very good.Very good brake pads. Recommended"
2,The tainted rantings of a former resident,"As is so often the case with Pilgers writings, his excellent research into the origins of Australian society is lost in hearsay and unverified gossip. At times the book represents little more than an expanded version of ""Who Weekly"".Perhaps more exasperating is the underlying disquiet that Pilger expresses about Australian society in general. Like other former Australians (Germaine Greer etc) Pilger has become content to sit comfortably at home in England critising a society in which he has not truely participated for 20 years. No number of smiling photos in the outback, or wistful stories of childhood in Bondi will disguise the underlying fact that he is still stung by 60's Australian society, and apparently believes that little has changed here since that time.The timely revelation of decades of abuse against indigenous Australians was skillfully and appropriately composed, but much of the rest of the book is grossly self indulgant"
1,well written conspiracy theorist's handbook,"I guess if it smells like a conspiracy, looks like a conspiracy, sounds like a conspiracy, well it must be the truth.Apparently, Australian politics throughout the 80's was held together by a bunch of 'mates'. The rule of the fat!Everyone was a mate - politicians, business leaders, trade unionists. This would make Australia the friendliest country in the world! Not the worst."
5,Detailed History of Critical Pacific Battle,"For WWII aficionados, this book is a great addition to your collection. I first came across it in the library and was rewarded with rich detail of this important military campaign. Great insights into the strategic ramifications of the battle as well as the small details of both the US and Japanese men, equipment and tactics. There are abundant maps, drawings and sidebar discussions of related topics (like how to aim artillery if you cannot see the target, how to land a plane on a carrier, etc). Two thumbs up. It is a shame books like this have fallen off the radar."
4,good ensemble of fifties rock instrumentals,"this set includes some outstanding early rock gutiar and other instrument sounds. there is the ferocious and famous rumble by link wray. the outstandingly pensive harlem nocturne by the viscounts and the tremendously influential and compelling sleepwalk by santo and johnny. also the overlooked but excellent bongo rock by preston epps. there are some other enjoyable tracks such as the happy organ by dave baby cortez and red river rock by johnny and the hurricanes. All in all this is more than just a trip down memory lane it is a sampling of some fine and ground breaking 1950s rock instrumentals that include truly jazz topsy by cozy cole. Only one complaint, why no bill black's cumbo tracks such as smokie on this cd?"
5,ALL GOOD,You 'oldies' will love this series of origiinal oldies. Nothing else to say except sometimes less is more. too many words required.
1,Horrible!,"There is a reason why these are not eligible for return. They are horrible! Please do not buy these cookies. I have sampled many gluten-free products, most are very good and these are by far the worst. I am out $ and feel ripped-off. Do yourself a favor and pass on these."
1,I threw them away,I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar.
3,Disappointed in texture,"It is close to impossible to find a cookie that is both soy free, wheat free, and the only sugar that is used is from natural juices: apple, etc. That is the only reason I gave the cookie such a high ranking...As for taste, the chocolate flavor is pronounced, I enjoy the ""crunch"", however, the texture of the cookie has a lot to be desired. The cookie needs to either be crunchier or more moist. As is it wants to stick to the roof of your mouth, and is just odd. Making it unappealing. If I had tasted the item prior to ordering, I wouldn't have bought a whole box full."
2,not what I expected,I was a bit disappointed in these. They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture. My son (6) does not like them.
2,Weird texture; too dry and crumbly...,"I love the other Nana's cookie bars and cookies, so I thought I'd give these a try even though they are ""No Gluten"" and made with rice flour instead of wheat flour. They look nice, but the texture is a bit strange (it's kind of like eating really fine sand) and they are too dry and crumble at the slightest touch. They don't taste bad, which is a plus, but I won't be buying these again."
4,"great for restricted diets, kids like",I have a 7 yr old w/food allergies and both he and my 3 yr old love these. I have compared to several other cookie/snack items made with no dairy & eggs and I think we all liked these the best. Definitely a must have for restricted diets.
5,finally something for those of us on restricted diets!!,"I love love love these cookie bars. I can't have any sugar or any gluten and happened upon these at Whole Foods. What a saving grace! The big cookies are also excellent, but I would eat the whole big cookie at one time. These little bars are perfect."
2,too dry,tastes like dry brownie w/ invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth. come on. we can do better than this for cookie bars.
3,"Moderately tasty, gluten free","Our family has members who keep kosher, who are vegetarians, who are unable to eat gluten, etc. This cookie covers all the bases, but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty. However, they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust, which is a great feature. I have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better.Really, though, how good can a gluten free cookie be?"
3,"Good, but not the best of the Nana's varieties","I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too. They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste. I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie. I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around."
4,Very Good!,"I've had the other Nana's No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they aren't that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good. They are more moist, have a good flavor and a little crunch. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that the texture is a little bit crumbly. I will be buying these again."
2,Yuck!,"The flavor is decent (berry vanilla), but I just can't handle the texture. It's like a mouthful of sawdust that just disintegrates when you bite into it. I've been gluten free for about 6 years, and there are much better products out there. My kids won't even eat these!"
1,A Gluten Free Ewweee.,"Like other reviewers, I rarely eat cookies because I have an anaphylactic response to wheat/gluten. Therefore I generally 'love' any cookies I'm not allergic to. These are an exception. The taste is mild and fleeting. The texture is like sand and leaves a dry feeling in your mouth. The only purpose these cookies are good for is dieting, because they are simply inedible. Blah."
5,The Best Concert Video I Have Seen,"This is the best concert DVD I have ever seen and listened to. I also have the CD and play it over an over. The musicianship is top notch. Clapton orchestrated the concert, and is superb! George's music is timeless, and Eric's arrangements bring it to life all over again.Very heartfelt and touching performances throughout, with Ringo and Paul playing together for the first time since the Beatles broke up.Highlights:1. ""Isn't it a Pity"" with Billy Preston on vocals and organ, builds to a moving chorus mixed with the ""Hey Jude"" chorus.2. ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" with great guitar licks by Clapton, and McCartney playing the opening piano intro... awesome!3. ""Wah Wah"", with everyone on stage, four drummers, including Ringo, having a great time, makes you wish you were on stage jamming with them.As you can see, this got 5-star ratings from everyone. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
4,A fitting George Harrison Tribute,A really great CD dedicated to a really great man. Listening to George's songs sung by those who he loved & loved him was highly emotional & enjoyable.
5,Moving tribute to George.,"What a talented song writer, and what a great concert tribute. Highlights for me included Sam Brown's rousing version of ""Horse To The Water"", Gary Brooker's up tempo ""Old Brown Shoe"" and Ringo Starr's excellent performance of ""Photograph"". All in all, every performance on here was excellent, and it was great to see Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr play together on stage."
5,Truly great in every way!,"The musicians in this performance are absolutely at their best on this night. So much love is shared-George would be so proud. I tear up almost every time this show gets close to finishing. The build up of emotion is so amazing, by the end you realize how great this show really was, and that it will never happen again. Thanks to DVD it can happen as often as you like. About as perfectly done a show as I've ever seen. The sound quality is unsurpassed. The editing makes you feel you are there. Will be the jewel in your concert DVD collection."
5,George Harrisons Spirit Lives On!,"The man of the hour is only present in spirit, but what a strong spirit it is, so strong is the feeling that comes off this DVD that it stays, lingers & invites you back for more. If future generations ask what George Harrision & the Beatles were all about this DVD says it all!"
4,All things must pass away...,"I always liked the Harrison Beatle songs the best, so it was a no-brainer to get this DVD.Really liked it, although I was not familiar with some of the performers - my bad, I guess.Don't much care for the Monty Python section in the concert, but because George was apparently a fan (an exec producer of a movie of theirs), there it is. Within that part, however, it was nice to see Tom Hanks involved without fanfare.Of course George had the heavy east Indian influence, but I liked Ravis Shankar and his daughter's contribution the least - but that's just me.I've got a few concert DVD's. This ranks right up there with the best. I dinged it one star only because of the 2 mentioned sections."
5,The Concert Touched My Heart!!!,"I Watched Both Discs, The Short Concert, And The One That Was Over Two Hrs. Long, Well I Couldn't Help But Remember How George Was Back In The Day When He Was The Quite Member Of The Beatles, To The Day He Was Part Of The Traveling Willberys. The Songs He Did Write While With The Beatles, With Paul,& Ringo Sing Those Songs, It Really Brought A tear To My Eyes. Just Seeing George's Son, I thought It's George When He Was Young. Then Having Jeff Lyenn & Tom Petty Come Out, Play Handle With Care, And The End Of The Line... Well I just Loved This Concert... I Haven't Bought Too Many Concerts On DVD, But I'm Sure Glad I did Buy This One....."
5,Perfect.,"The perfect tribute for the perfect artist with perfect love, that's what this is. As the cynic I can sometimes be, I am emotionally touched by this tribute. Very personally do I feel my admiration and love for George. Anything less than this tribute would have been insulting, anything more would have been too. It's genuine love displayed by people who loved and cherished a rare type of person in this world, who is even rarer among musicians. He walked his talk. He is George Harrison, a man who has influenced millions, if not billions of people. Buy this DVD set and you will be moved very deeply by the gratitude and affection shown by his friends. Brilliant, if I could give it more stars your monitor would be filled with them."
5,ONE OF THE BEST LIVE CONCERT DVD'S,"A concert performed on November 29th , 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall for the late George Harrison. Terrific concert DVD. It became a special concert after Paul McCartney stepped to the stage and said his words that sort of made everyone refocus on why they were all there. From there on the show became very special.I have to agree with an earlier reviewer about the Monty Python segment feeling a bit out of place. It actually slowed things down a bit but the ""George's Band"" musical performances with Clapton , Billy Preston , Dhani Harrison and others came after that and the performances are so superb that it totally makes this 2 disc DVD worth purchasing. One of the best concert DVD's on the market right now."
4,Moving tribute to George Harrison,"Eric Clapton loved George Harrison as a friend, as a musician, as a songwriter, as a guitar player, as a human being. It definitely shows in this concert DVD. The concert begins with the Indian music section, and this music is rather impressive. Ravi Shankar and his daughter were in charge of this part, and I enjoyed it immensely. The second part is done by Monty Python, which George absolutely loved Monty Python, but I, personally, can NOT stand Monty Python, that's why I give the DVD 4 instead of 5 stars. So this part I skip. Then Eric takes the stage with other musicians who were friends of George's. For me the highlights are Eric Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Tom Petty Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney. If you are a George Harrison/Beatle fan this DVD is worth the price. Even if you're just a music fan this DVD is worth the price."
5,This is a MUST SEE,I orig. seen the Concert on PBS with a ton of interruptions. I recently purchased the DVD because of the Music and all the Artists that gathered to pay homage to George and his life was amazing. His Son was on stage playing with all The Artists. His wife made an Appearance as well. All the Music/songs played were over the Top with Feeling and purpose. The purpose of HONOR. I highly recommend this DVD.Thank You George.
5,As good as it should be,"This is one of the best concert dvd's I've ever seen. The performances, the song selection, the sound, the video direction and the picture quality are everything one could ask for. Sure, there were several more of George's songs that I would have loved to have seen performed, but I'll not be greedy about it. If you've ever enjoyed a George Harrison song then this dvd is for you. The menu alone is practically inspirational. Love it, love it, love it."
3,MISSING ONE HUGE INGREDIENT,"I read the reviews; I see where most rated it a ""5 star"". I'm not saying I disagree. I only love GOD more than this particular man. Yet I feel like I came away with a different perspective on the film. Not that the performances weren't first rate; they were, especially Jeff's ""The Inner Light"", which was so sincere and heartfelt, I could feel his emotion right through the tv.What I COULD NOT manage to overcome: the recurring expectation of George to come out onstage at some point. Maybe it's just me, but that made me feel anxious, and I can't seem to shake that feeling every time I've gone back to watch it. He's MISSING and you KNOW IT. So, for me, I just can't sit through it more than once, every once in a while, with long breaks inbetween. I recommend it highly, believe me. Definitely should make it part of your ""collection"". I'm just stating my personal experience...and I'm betting I'm not the only one. It's been 11 years and I guess I'm just not there yet"
2,Audio problems,"The Audio is terrible, volume changes from high to low during several of the songs. Not sure if this is a problem with our purchase or an overall problem with the recording."
5,Top of the line.,"If you love The Beatles, and who doesn't, buy this now. It's great, no complaints.Heck, buy the soundtrack, too, I did...Sincerly,Music on Pig Turd Alley"
5,A Concert for George,"Great product, very high quality. It was wonderful to see so many extraordinary singers /artists playing beautful songs to George."
3,Great Music - Can do without the Indian music,"This DVD features some nice George Harrison covers by some of the music industry's finest musicians who happens to be George's buddies. The whole movie however could do without the Indian sitar music (i know i'll get some flak from the Indian musicos out there and the Beatle purists)...that music just didn't do it for me...when it was all good old rock and roll George music, its just great and fine and super...Beatles fans should love Clapton's renditions and Billy Preston's piano playing...the ending is quite touching and brought little tears to my eyes...a definite must buy..just fast forward past the Indian music :)"
4,Wonderful tribute,"I just got the DVD for Christmas and loved it. I thought the music selected was great. It included Beatles, Traveling Wilbury's and his solo work. Highlights were ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps (Clapton/McCartney/Starr), ""Something"" (McCartney),""My Sweet Lord"" (Preston), Taxman(Petty),""Handle With Care (Lynne) and many more. It was great seeing George's son onstage playing with the band. This DVD is a wonderful tribute to George Harrison.P.S. To some of the reviewers of this DVD, the Paul McCartney bashing is getting old !!!"
5,One of the best Concerts !!!,"This is one of those DVDs you can start, sit back and don't stand up until it ends. I love it ! At the first part of the concert, just as in the Concert for Bagladesh, there's an indian music section directed by Shankar's daughter (Nora Jones Sister). Before I see this part I tought it could be boring but it isn't. It is wonderful.Tho only thing that I miss in this George Harrison tribute is the precense of Bob Dylan who hasn't been there...I can't imagine why.You can here and see many Gorge's friends singing his songs together (Eric Clapton, Tom Petty; Jef Lyne, Paul MCartney, Ringo Star; etc, etc). If you still don't bought it, do it, it is wonderful."
5,"Absolutely, Positively Spectacular!!","Received this incredible DVD as a Christmas present, and upon viewing it was simply blown away! I'm not usually a fan of concerts, particularly tribute concerts, put to DVD. They almost always fail to re-create the vibe or feeling of the live performance. This concert is the exception that proves the rule. Great songs played by legendary musicians in tribute to their friend. And, perhaps that's the main thing that separates this from other tribute concerts. Each and every performer loved George, and that love is apparent throughout. Each and every performance is magical, and watching becomes almost a spiritual experience. If you're reading these reviews because you're thinking of buying, then think no more. This is a sensational DVD - 5 stars is not enough. Buy and enjoy!"
5,"Very moving, incredible musicianship","I was fortunate enough to see the show at the Royal Albert Hall, and it was the most moving concert I've experienced. I can't believe how well it's been captured here. It says so much to see such a talented and diverse group of friends work so hard to pull this one night only show together, and for all the right reasons. You can tell they are incredibly inspired and moved by what they're doing, and it clearly helped them deal with a loss.And the performances, out of this world! Billy Preston on ""Isn't It A Pity"", Clapton/McCartney/Starr on ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", a Wilbury's tune, the Eastern music, and the Pythons too. There will never be another show like this. There was a lot of talent, and many egos on that stage, but they all kept it in check by remembering what was important. Don't pass this up!"
5,Great DVD,This is without a doubt the best concert I have had the pleasure of watching. Top class entertainers and talent with a wonderful tribute to a great guitar player and person. I highly recommend this to anyone. Enjoy!!!
5,Concert for George,"You have Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Jeff Lynn, Eric Clapton, Gary B. from Procol Harem, Andy Fairweather-Lowe, Klaus Voorman, Joe Brown and a host of other killer musicians performing George Harrison songs. Need I say more? By the time Billy preston gets through with ""Isn't It A Pity"", if you don't have tears in your eyes, I would say you're not human. It's really a Video you just have to see and hear."
3,Concert for George,"First of all. It's for George. So that is great.George was great. He made up part of my band. The Beatles.Best that was ever.The first bit of the concert is so good, but it is a bit long. Lots of long drawn out Indian Music. But it is good. Just long. So you might get bored a bit.The best bit of the whole DVD, is when Paul comes on stage and does about two or three numbers. I loved that.But the DVD, as well as the CD is great.And again.If you are a Harrison fan, you must get it.So yes buy it.It is a nice Tribute to a great fellow.and just the fact that Paul and Ringo are there and playing on stage together is fab.Ringo is on Drums, and Paul is on Guitar and Piano.and the bit where they sing.""While my Guitar Gently Weeps"" with Ringo on Drums and Paul on Piano is ""Fabulous"".That is a keeper for any Die hard Beatles Fan."
3,Almost unwatchable,"The Indian music was very good. The covers of George's songs were dreadful until Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers came on stage. It may be that the musicians were too sad to play well, or perhaps George was simply that much better on guitar than everyone else, even Clapton. Petty got things rolling, they were the real professionals. Ringo picked things up and also was the first to acknoledge the pain when he introduced the song Photograph that he wrote with George, that he knew the meaning changed with George gone for real. Even for big Harrison fans, maybe especially for them, this is a renter rather than a keeper."
3,I was disappointed,"I had been seeing the ads on TV for this DVD and it looked like it would be a really fun and exciting concert to watch. I was quite disappointed when I began watching the DVD and the first half of it was Indian music. The second half was better, and actually had some great moments. However, overall the great moments were too few.I also purchased the Bee Gees - Just One Night concert which I would highly recommend. It is an excellent show. Also, I purchased Simon & Garfunkle - Concert in Central Park and found that to be very enjoyable."
1,Audio is totally unacceptable,"Don't buy this DVD if you expect to enjoy your home theater system. The audio is uneven, ranging from wonderfully crisp to terribly muted."
1,Concert for George,The second disk was compressed so badly that it was extremely slow to play. Therefore it sounded like a warped record. I can't believe Amazon sold me such defective merchandise. I love George's music but this disk was horrible.
4,Powerful,"This book begins with a very powerful speech and it is well worth reading. After the main talk, which I would rate 5 starts the book continues with a discussion of the authors life. This second larger part of the book does have some gems in it but it is not nearly as powerful as the main speech at the beginning."
4,Beautiful Doll But No Display Value,"As with all of Mattel's Barbie brides, this doll is incredibly beautiful; however, it comes in a display box with a plain brown background. I even wrote a letter to Mattel complaining about the plainness of the display box. Look at it this way. Imagine a box lined with a plain brown paper bag. This is what you'll get.If you want the doll to be displayed outside of the box, then this is the doll for you. If you are a serious collector and want to display inside the box, you will not be impressed at all."
4,I liked it!!,"In my view this is a good book for someone who remembers home and wants to duplicate some of home in a far away place. I grew up in New Orleans and now live in Texas. If you don't know it, we New Orleans people are picky about our food. I have also spent a lot of time in a lot of places outside the US. Sometimes you just want to taste some of those simple things you grew up eating. The hardest thing is finding the ""stuff"" you want and deciding on a reasonable substitute when you can't find it. So, I really appreciate the list of where to get the ""hook-up"" in Paris. There is noting worst than being in Paris or Lisbon for a few weeks and just wanting some red beans, greens and corn bread and not knowing where to go to get the dish or the ingredients. Now I know it is not just me. I love the art work and the background material."
5,a tribute to family food,"This book isn't just a collection of recipes. The author has gathered family recipes and shared family memories as well. The recipes aren't overly complicated, particularly good for people like myself that don't have a lot of time for cooking. Ms. Wells has provided some of the history behind different ingredients, alternate ingredients if some are hard to find, and laid out the recipes in a very easy to follow manner. I love how she has shared some of her own family's history in this book. The photography of the food is outstanding. This is a book to enjoy reading start to finish, as well as trying out the recipes."
1,Don't WASTE your money!!,"This cookbook was a HUGE disapointment! These recipes are the same ones that you can get on the boxes and labels at the grocery store for free! Fried eggs? The pictures are nice, tho they don't name the pictured food. If you want a good soul food cookbook, get ""The Black Family Reunion Cookbook"" for 1/4 the price."
3,nothing I didn't already know,"The book was ok. Having grown up on soul food there were no surprises.I was hoping that there would be a french twist to the recipes such as""Soul Food ala French Bistro"""
2,Same old song,"I found the recipes to be nothing new. Yes, there were stories thrown in to disguise Ms. Wells lack of culinary skills. The illustrations and the photography were quite pleasant, I found myself looking for these two things. Ms Wells I think needs to try again.I was sorry I purchased this book."
3,Make your own,This is just a nut driver with a slot cut into it. The edges are not even smoothed. You can make your own in 20 min for half the price! But it works!
2,could be better,"this holder seems like a ""one size fits all"" that doesn't quite fit real well. It does the job but had I to do it over again, I probably wouldn't buy it again."
3,marcia,My grandson has know problems playing this game at all. He enjoys it. no problems with it. He plays it all day long.
2,Super dirty,The system was very very dirty and d pad doesn't work very well and the cracks in the system have lots of dirt and food inside of it.
1,Dpad,"So as promised, this GameBoy Advance was in good condition. However, the Dpad isn't working. I definitely over paid for this product and now I have to figure out a way to get the Dpad to work properly BEFORE christmas! Thanks for the inconvenience and trouble. I was really hoping to get an honest seller who doesn't rip people off. Along with the GBA Dpad now working, it also reeks of oranges. So I'm going to go out on a limb and guess someone dropped this GBA in their orange juice or something. I am VERY disappointed with this product and the description was misleading. This GBA was worth more like 15$ instead of 50$"
3,ok but,"Disappointed !!! Hard to see and Disappointed in product , Hard 2 see your games almost impossible !!! THE GBA SP is better thank fully and easier to see !!!! ;) Good luck ;> !!!!"
1,i did not like the product,i have been waitting for this product on december and when it arrived i was so disspointed because it was not what i expected i only recieved the machine but no the instruction neither the cable and what about the games???? are not included??? i dont understand...
4,Great for everyone,"I bought this for my 7 yr old daughter. She loves it! So do I. I haven't played any video games since the original Nintendo came out. The lighting isn't that great, but we got a light for it and she's gone through 3 pairs of batteries already. I also bought the a/c adapter."
2,does it really play all???,"Gameboy advance is really a hightech gaming compare to the past versions of gameboy's. Softwares are good and also the graphics. But when i insert my old cartriges on this console, i can only hear sounds and without the picture. So all of my all cartriges are useless now. another thing is the backlight nintendo should launch GBA with builtin backlite i usually get eye stains from playing it in my room, or they should launch a backlite gadget that can be installed to the GBa's screen."
2,What Year do we Live in?!,"The Advance has no backlight. You would think after Color, they would've put in a backlight. Visibility is horrible even in good lighting. Seriously, what decade do we live in? Get an SP, stay away from this one."
4,Good but we NEED a back-lit screen!,"This is a great system. Awesome 32-bit graphics, stero-sounding sound, and AAA games. It plays GB (Game Boy), GBC (Game Boy Color), and of course GBA (Game Boy Advance) games. My only complaint is no back-lit screen. They say it saves on batteries, but I think me and many other people would pay a little more in battery money to have back-lit screen. What? You're still reading my review? Well, get up and go buy one! NOW! Oh yeah, and buy a faw games and some light source."
4,Kodak Slide Projector,"Very prompt service. Slide Central also included a carrying case and an upgraded lens at no additional cost. A personalized note was in the box! Very nice tocuh! Projector, which Kodak stopped making about six years ago, works great and appears in new shape except for a small crack on top. The crack doesn't impact functionality and we will probably just use epoxy to fix it. Not worth contacting the company about. Overall great experience."
2,Kanal,"Kanal fascinates me as one of the best war movies ever made. Each character shares a tragic story of bravery, cowardice, betrayal, and sacrifice. However, this video copy was disappointing. There was hardly any sound, even with the volume at the highest setting. Granted, the movie is in Polish and I had to rely on subtitles, but there is more to communication than just words. I missed the emotion in the voice, and missed the ambiance created by the sound effects. Also the picture quality in the kanals seemed poorer than I had remembered, keeping me in near darkness. Kanal is a great movie, but this video's quality was disappointing."
5,"Yes This is the ""Right Sound""","I believe enough has been said. Shostakovich has to be played with a special sound. I would not say ugly but crude may be. Russian orchestras from the communist era have that sound. The sound Shostakovich was familiar with. These perfomances are very exciting and ""brutal"" in the good sense. The tempi somethimes are on the edge, being too fast, but I believe that depicts the struggle to survive in that terrible political environment. If you like Haitink or Jansons' sets and believe there is nothing missing in their interpretations you better stick with those. This set is very different. I believe closer to what the intend was. Right now this set is terribly expensive so consider Mravinsky or Gergiev by the time you have the chance to aquire this treasure"
4,Good Danish Electric Blues,"Long time Champion Jack Dupree Guitar-partner Kenn Lending, demonstrates on this album his ability to create fine funky big City Blues from his base in Copenhagen (Denmark). Most of the compositions is Lendings own work, but both Freddie King and Memphis Slim is represented on the Track list. The Band and Lendings guitar play is excellent, Lendings Vocal seems to be the weakest part on the Album. Do your self good - buy this album and get the Big City Blues from this Danish Super Guitarist!!"
3,Ditto on the good but flaws,"This is a good tool and will get you out of a jam, but it is not my new go-to tool. Speed control is poor. It basically runs either fast or very fast. You can't use a slow turn to position the bit, and the high speed licks to chew-up screw heads. The clutch positions don't provide enough range, driving a 3 inch screw into a 2x4 requires setting it on the drill position to get enough torque to recess the screw. I am also not happy about spending the extra bucks for a ""12V"" tool, only to discover it is really the same as the 10.8V tool. (The Ridgid X3 impact driver has the top spot in my tool box.)"
3,THIS IS NOT IMPACT! IT IS ONLY COMPACT,The tile said it all! If you know what is ImpactDriver! Impact is something like (PS40-2a)
3,Disapointed,I have several other Bosch products such as the 36 volt drill and it rocks. So when this drill couldn't even drill through a bottom cabinet I was very disappointedIn general I would tell someone to not expect too much from this drill
1,BAD Bosch tool!,I needed a compact cordless angle drill/driver...I thought this Bosch was the answer...MISTAKE!!! My brother also bought this tool and ran into the same problems....What is with the auto clutch??? The auto clutch drove me NUTS!!!!Bottom line is I don't have time to wait for this drill to do what it is suppose to do...just drill/drive!!! I got rid of it through a tool consignment shop. Save yourself from my mistake and buy something else. Very disappointed.
4,"Solid, but special-purpose","I needed a drill that could get into tight places for a cabinetry project I was working on, and the Bosch seemed like the best choice. It's my first experience with the Bosch brand, and generally I'm satisfied with it.I like the two included batteries, the fast recharge time and the beefy performance (regardless whether it's labeled ""10.8"" or ""12""). I seem to get substantially longer than advertised battery life - a good thing.Only gripes are that it seems to spin up somewhat eratically sometimes, going from slow to full speed at an odd pace. And it's somewhat of a special purpose tool...even though I suppose you could use it for just about any task, I find myself reaching for my other tools unless I'm doing something in a cramped spot.Overall seems like a high quality unit that will last a long time, and I have no regrets. Solid four-star rating."
3,False Ads,I gave this product only 3 stars because after purchasing a PS10-2A (12v) version of this tool I observed that it uses the same batteries and charger as the PS10-2 (10.8v) version. If you go to the Bosch site it does not even have any information about the discontinued 10.8v version. I called Bosch customer service and was told that other than the labeling these tools are in fact one in the same. The Bosch rep asserted that the 10.8v tool was under rated and a decision was made to relabel the 10.8v tool to 12v and sell it as the 12v Max. My opinion is that this is deceptive by Bosch. If you are in the market find a cheaper 10.8v. It is the exactly the same tool as the 12v tool! Read the specs...exactly the same for both!
2,"Good design, needs improvement","Overall this is a great design; heavy and beefy as you'd expect by the price tag. However, the trigger has a half second delay that will eventually drive you nuts, and the motor cuts out if you try to drive or pull a screw over 1 1/2"". Unless you really need this to get in tight spots for one specific application, I'd go with something else."
3,borderline to weak,pros- adjustable head- long battery lifecons-the clutch dosent work ( it honsestly dosent i screwed up big things because that clutch set up)- theres no torque at all the only thing it has the power to do is run 2 inch screws and drill 1/4 inch holes through pine.- for the extreme lack of power i feel they could atleast throw me a bone and put an LED light on this.Overall if your a appliance repair man or a sheetrocker who need a driver for tight spaces then this is good for you.If your a carpenter expect to have to pre drill every hole 7/8 of the way for any screw over 2 1/2 inches long.if your a contracter or anything thats not a repair man sheetrocker or a woman who needs a tool for light tasks i cant recommend this tool for you because you would wasting your time pree drilling everything and you would loose over a hundred dallors buying this.
4,A Small Powerhouse,"My Bosch PS10-1 has been at my side for three years and my heart is broken because it recently was (accidentally) doused with water and a new one is smarter and cheaper than repairing the damaged one.Mine is used for one of those special 'in between' small drill needs and big, honking 18V impact drill needs. I have a pool service and I use my PS10-1 attached to special clamp sockets I invented (multi-tork.com)and manufacture for the high-speed removal of pump, motor and filter knobs, plugs and clamp assemblies. The variable-speed and sensitive trigger aren't serious factors for me. The faster the better; and the PS-10 removes the filter hardware in 7 seconds or less--literally.My only gripes-which are previously noted in earlier reviews-is the non-existent OFF switch and the wiggle room in the bit grip. These are, however, minor and pale when compared to the PS10's battery-charge life, torque and speed."
2,Good but has flaws,"The pros are the compact head, variable speed and the 2 batteries.The cons are the thing is FAT making the switch between forward and reverse is awkward. There is no safety switch to keep the tool from being switched on if its hit by something in the tool bag. And the minimum torque is not that minimum. Its quite a bit of torque before the electronic clutch kicks in.I will keep it but would not buy it again until some of the quirks are worked out."
3,Have other tools and this one not as useful,I'm sure I'll find something that this tool is good at but it hasn't happened yet. The articulation will probably prove useful at some point but I haven't had a chance to use it much. The pistol grip drivers are much more useful so far.
2,Opened Box,Drill shipped as an open box. Looked like it was returned by soemone.Drill is great though. Have 2 units and like them and use them daily.
3,Mixed review,"I liked the design with the built in pump and the pillow-top feel, but I had a problem with a slow leak the first night we used it. I can see how the built-in pump might create a hole when the bed is folded for storage."
1,Seriously Disappointed,"We bought not one but three Coleman airbeds for company over Christmas. Not one of them lasted through the night, not even the first night. My 74 year old brother in law ended up on the floor. I am humiliated and furious with Coleman for the poor quality."
1,Built in pump leaks,"Like others have mentioned, the built in pump is ill-designed and eventually creates a slow leak that gets worse over time.I've bought two -- hoping that the first was just my bad luck. It wasn't. The first lasted a month and a half. The second lasted just over a month.So -- buy the old fashioned ones, folks. Coleman makes a incredibly comfortable camp bed -- but it's new pump design sucks."
5,"Comfortable, tight fitting, wonderful.","I was hesitant to get a harness that fits like a g-string. This one wraps around the hips and thighs and is comfortable to wear. The dong isn't too big, it isn't too small, and it is easy to clean. The vibrating bullet only has one speed, but it is powerful. A good buy."
2,Poorly designed,"These things are very thin, thinner than a dime. Imagine putting your fingers through the loops and squeezing on the business end of a butter knife. They are extremely uncomfortable. They look nice, the 18/8 steel is nicely polished, but functionally they are useless."
4,SALAD TONGS REVIEW,"These salad tongs are sturdy, light weight and one can get under and over the lettuce and fixings in a large sald bowl. I would make the loops in the handles a bit smaller in order to insure a better grip whne tossing."
3,Salad Tongs,"These tongs are okay. I was expecting a more durable pair. They have not broken, but feel a little flimsy and the hinge wiggles a bit. They do look nice for intertaining though."
3,Nothing Special!,"I bought this film only because Jane Seymour is in it. She has a minor part as a parent and it is clearly not one of her best endeavors. However Jane's alluring ""crooked' smile makes an appearance or two and that was enough for me! I fast forwarded through the rest of it!"
3,one of them is hot,"It's several different shows put together. I only watched the one with Kat and Nikki, they are on top on the cover.They are very hot girls. The price is quite good if you get it used. The main question is, can you click on the one with Kat and Nikki and just see that. The answer is, yes you can!"
1,True Hustler,"The true meaning of a hustler is someone who can take a peice of [junk] and convince someone else that the [junk] is worth [money], but they could get it for only $25. That's exactly how Master P is working Da Last Don. If you buy this [junk] at all, you'll regret it. If you hear otherwise from one of your freinds, don't believe'm. This film is a wanna-be Godfather, Scarface, and Good Fellas, and Master P's character is a wanna-be Michael Corleon and Tony Montana. The story-line is cheesie,and the actors put about just as much feeling into acting as low-grade pornstars, which brings me to my next point. This film doesn't even measure up to porn flick status, even with all the gratutious nudity. If this film were a porn flick, it would still be wack."
2,it was aiight,"This was not the best Master P film that I have seen. Bout It had way more potential. I have been a P fan since the beginning of No Limit, but this was a waste of film. There was just something about it that turned me off. But i still got luv fo ya P. Keep doin' ya thang!!"
2,Should Satisfy Master P Fans,"Granted, this is a low budget film with some truly horrible acting, but it still has its moments. The ""I forgot something"" scene must be seen to be believed. Master P fans can add a few stars to my review total, as can people who are interested in watching a film that is unintentionally(?) hilarious. And yes, it's 'bout it, 'bout it."
4,Really wonderful Christmas album,"We picked up this CD and its companion at the Texas State Fair. If you like bluegrass, you will love this CD. Deering's deft reinterpretations of old Christmas standards are truly enjoyable."
1,Cheap peace of plastic,"I think it's just a bit too expensive (I paid $125) for a piece of plastic and cheap-looking metal. I purchased it as a gift and I was embarrassed when it was opened... The thing does look cheap. I bought it because it had only 5 star ratings (well, there were only three ratings - it should have warned me...). I suspect now that these ratings were not from real customers, but from the manufacturer or the seller of the stuff... The real price for it would be about $10-$20... but I would not buy it for that price either."
3,Not the best.....,"The console is okay and has a cool design. But the problem is that it is very hard to see the screen in low lighting, and when you press the buttons you can get fingerprints on the screen that is hard to get off. I would highly recommend a Gameboy Advance SP or DS instead."
1,Buy The SP!,this system sucks! it has a terrible screen you can hardly see the game! ignore the box where it shows a bright screen thatis just false advertisment! I highly reccommend the sp i just got one and it is a lot better than this. its foldable to protect the screen its small it has a back light a rechargable battery so i say spend the extra money to get something better and please dont waste it on this!
1,What [For],There is absolutely NO POINT buying a GBA. Its the same thing as a Game Boy only the thing is shaped different. 32-bit?. Do yourself a favor and dont buy this....
4,Gameboy Advance for an almost 4 year old!,"We bought this for my almost 4 year old Son for Christmas ...against my better judgement. My Husband insisted my Son would love it.I thought..he's much to young. I must confess my Son not only loves it,he plays it just fine..Out of the many gifts he recieved & already has...Gameboy Advance is his favorite. He carries it everywhere!!! I have never seen any toy that could hold my Son's attention like Gameboy Advance does. All I can say is...Run don't walk this is a must have!!!Not only does my Son love it...My Husband & I bought one for ourselves as well!!!"
4,an ok system,This system is ok when you play game boy color games in it it is really dark you have to hold it up to the light and eaven then you have to hold it at a difernt angle.but it is ok and i wold prefer it to eany one who wants a handheld but i would wait a while and buy a game boy color.
3,Game boy Advance is not as it seems,"I got it and it was fun. the graphics are great and so is the sound. The only problem was that the lighting is so dim. Its hard to see indoors, even with a light. Its okay when your outside in the sun, but you still have to hold it in the same angle the whole time."
5,I love Gameboy Advance!!,"I can't believe that some people think that the gameboy advance stinks. First of all, people think that it needs a backlit screen! What handheld console ever had a back lit screen? I think that the gameboy advance is the best portable game system ever created. It's shape makes it easier to hold than the gameboy color, and it has the same type of graphics as a PS1! (Gameboy advance has the same amount of megabites as PS1) (32MB) I hope this review is helpful to you."
3,don't get hypnotized by this toy,i first got this toy thinking it would be a fun cool portable game system but i was wrong!!! for a couple reasons1- buttons were too small2- the screen was too dark even in the light i couldn't see it3- it was very boringmy advice to u is not to buy this toy
3,game boy advance is the second most fun game system!!!!!!,"This is a really fun game system compared to game boy color!!!I got it for chanukah and it was great!When my mom found out it had a bad light, she traded it in for a game boy advance sp so I woulden't go blind. I'd reccomend this system to anybody who also has enough money for a game light."
3,NEED A LIGHT?,"this is an awesome handheld, portable gaming machine when matched up with an afterburner internal light kit.I give it 3 stars simply because I had to fork out the extra dough to be able to see the darn screen. Other than that its a great little piece of electronic equipment. If ya cant hold out for the Gameboy advance sp, i suggest u get one of these and install the afterburner. its not difficult to intall and the results are awesome."
5,Very Satisfied,I received the product well packaged and in a timely manner. It was in working condition.
1,screen too dark to see,Well i guess it is buyer beware oh sure it was in great condiction but who could possibly play it? even with the little snap on light it was hardly playable.the screen is so dark on it.I was and still is very dissappointed.
3,"Fun, but not the best","My biggest issue is that the screen is very tough to see, making the more graphic intensive games less interesting. It's really tough to get the right angle to see it well enough to play."
4,Fun but Dim,"This console is easier to play than the GB and GBC but as stated in other reviews, the screen is rather dim if you are not directly in front of a light source. I also bought the worm light but the tiny bulb glares off of the screen making it difficult to see some detail. I prefer this to the GBC but I wish the screen were brighter.To the reviewer who said that those of us who can't see the screen well need to get our eyes checked....well, you should get your grammar and spelling checked!"
5,hi,Sixteen blazing bits has always been my favorite level of gaming. This is like being able to carry a snes in your pocket.
5,The Future of Handhelds,"The Game Boy Advance is the most graphically advanced system to date, and features an extensive line of exclusive software, hardware add-ons that allow you to watch TV or tun it into a Palm style computer, and also plays original Game Boy and Game Boy Color games. The graphics are comparible to the early offerings of the Sony Playstation, a low polygon 3D game, or a boldly colored 2D game. Also, the system allows for entertaining multiplayer adventures. Almost all the games available have features playable with friends,even if they don't have the game. With the current software having at least one ""must-have game"" in each genre of game, the system is one to look into, and is the only mainstream portable system available in North America."
1,Nintendo is DISHONORABLE,"Shame on Nintendo for putting GBA on the market. All they had to do was solve the poorly lit screen problem and they would have had an excellent product. It does not have a backlight. It is poorly lit. My child has to be a contortionist to angle the console just right, to get the right amount of light, to be able to play the games. Two of the light products I tried are poor excuses to solve the lighting problem. Save the money and your kid's eyesight. I hope I can trade in my children's consoles when Nintendo comes out with a backlit GBA."
1,Dispointed in this product.,"Very disappointed in this product. It was scratched up, and my grandson could hardly even see the screen because of it. It definitely was NOT slightly used."
4,Gameboy Advance rocks,"This is a great system. Even though everyone is going for the Nintendo Ds, including myself. This system is really good to. It has a whopping 32 bit procceser. That is as much as a Playstation 1 according to this site at least. It has great graphics and has exellent games including Final Fantasy V, and VI. There is also great Mario games for this systme to. You can play all your Gameboy Pocket games and Gameboy color games in this system to. It is a great little device. It is no where as good as the Nintendo DS. It also has a lot of great games. If your parents or you don't care to much on price, just a little, Go for the DS. But if you want something kind of cheap with great graphics and games go for the Gameboy Advance."
1,This is the worst company service!!! A piece of junk made in China!!,This is the worst company I have ever dealt with BUYER BEWARE!!!! This dryer is a piece of junk. I woudn't recommend this to anyone!!! Do not buy Hot Tools junk!!
5,NIce Dryer,Got this dryer and it works great so far. I only use it to finish drying my hair after I've braided it (once a week). The winters here dictate that I don't go out the house with wet hair.
1,Cheap quality,"this product is good if you seldomly use it. Well I need to use it once a week and now that I've had it for about 2 months, the hose connection doesn't connect to the bonnet. ALL the hot air blows out of the bonnet. OK, how can I dry my hair now? you can't reconnect the connector to the bonnet at all. not even with crazy glue! HORRIBLE quality and it takes FOREVER to dry my hair and that's even if it drys at all."
3,Nice Hairdryer but Weak Blower,"The product has four temperature settings but the blower is weak (like a low setting on a normal hairdryer) and it takes double time to dry my hair. The hose from the machine to the bonnet is very short---about 24""---so one needs to sit very close to the unit. I was disappointed. I needed a hairdryer with a hose and bonnet that had a higher volumne of air output and a slightly longer hose."
2,Disappointed,"The motor/blower unit is actually quite good, but the air tube is not long enough. Where the tube meets the soft bonnet is a very weak area and when heated up to highest temperature becomes weaker. The bonnet does not provide even heat to entire head. If they could perfect the air tube and bonnet, this unit would be worth the price. It's so hard to find a good soft bonnet hair dryer! This would be perfect for traveling if it just did what it was supposed to do."
4,JUST READ IT ( I cant even explain it but READ IT),do not pass this one by.... you will NOT regret it. its captivating and devastating. its a MUST read!
4,My 9-yo son liked it,"My 9yo son read it and really liked the book. He said it had action, adventure and somemystery. He wish the book was longer and had sequels. Best of all, it was a $0 download deal to get him interested in this story."
3,not too bad,nice book that is a great little reader for kids of any age. I would recommend this for all kids that love little animals.
2,sad,Nothing wrong with the story. You need to identify short stories as such. This is unbecoming of Amazon. The writing was professional and I might be interersted in a COLLECTION OF SHORT STORIES by this author.
3,CHEEP KIDS BOOK,"I ordered this by mistake. It was not worth the ten bucks i paid for it. But it was my bad. I wouldn't pay over three dollars(new). About 50 pages long, 2 - 4 page chapters. Good for a 7 -10 year old."
2,The Monkey King...Story good but Priced outrageously,I wanted a copy of the Monkey King to share with my reading club and purchased it for $46.00. I got this 44 page book that is not worth over $10. Very disappointing. No worth the money I paid.
1,Not what it seems,We thought this was for a BABY as it was in the baby section but it is for a 5 year old child. We bought it as a gift and my sister was very disappointed. I think the preview is very misleading.
2,just a pretentious porn flick,"Gore Vidal soon refused to be shown in the credits after seeing the film for which he wrote the script. When the crappy editing was enriched with luscious porn scenes it was lost. Some great actors were forced to roam around the hopping and bopping (with some great bj-scenes). Either cut or self-censored, this movie comes in various lengths. What counts here: the shorter the better."
2,WHY WASTE YOUR TIME?,"I saw this movie after a friend raved about it. To tell the truth I found the movie to be vile, disgusting and in NO WAY erotic. If you are really into seeing an erotic movie rent something like 9 1/2 weeks. The sex scenes were nauseating, but not as nauseating as the violent, unnecessary content verging on sadism. If this is what your into, then you would love this movie, but for the rest of us, WHY WASTE YOUR TIME?"
2,Fair,"Caligula is a pretentious film. This film is a pure example of a ""guilty pleasure"". Caligula is a explicit, controversial film. This film is not erotic at all, with the exception of two scenes in which the shadows, colors/hues and camera angles are used in a very artistic form. Please note that these scenes, and others are edited in the R-rated version. Overall, the set-design in this film is awful. The basic plot of this film, is to follow the ultra-violent, neurotic raise to power of Caligula/Cesar (Malcolm McDowell. This film is set in 1st century Rome, the performances and lost. There is a lack of plot, simply due to the need to focus on explicit sex. Peter O'Toole (Tiberius) is totally wasted in this film. Caligula is pure pornography, but the finale of this film is very satisfying. This film is not for all tastes."
5,Intense sexuality.,"I give this movie 5 stars for the acting and for the intense sexuality of the video. I was able to see it on the big screen in 1980 and it was wild and exciting then as it is now. Not for the weak hearted, this video casts many variations on the sexual appetite of Caligula and his subjects. A ""must see"" and a gem to add to ones' video collection.I want to be the first to know when it becomes available for purchase again."
2,Junk except for ...pseudo-history buffs,"Probably the best thing in this movie is actress Laura Gemser. Alas, she is totally miscast. The movie is depraving, gory and shows a madman who sadistically survives despite being bawdy,overly-lavish and shrewd. Anyone Caligula has the slighted hint is a betrayer suffers brutually. Cowards bow down. One brave person lurks in the shadows while Caligula rapes a young girl and then blames her incident on others.The McDowell version was first. It should be seen, only if for the fact that while longer, something can be taken away. To [occupy] a night, rent Haughton and have a good chaser handy.Dr. Alan D. Kardoff"
5,Good cable for the price,"When buying cables there are only a few things to consider. Price,quality of materials and bandwidth. I have some premium cables I use to benchmark the inexpensive ones I buy. Usually there are insignificant differences in bandwidth tests. This is the case here. For $3.49 connect computers and printers with cables instead of wireless and enjoy the increased reliability."
3,It's functional,"It does what I need it to do. I had already purchased 2 of these at another store. I felt I needed a couple of more serving pieces. I bought these because they matched what I already had. However, if I had not bought the first 2, I would not have bought more of these. Amazon also had some serving spoons that are made in America. If I hadn't already bought the other spoons, I would have bought the American made spoons."
1,QuickLink is bad,"Got this with a new ""AirCard"" and it would never connect. I definitely would warn against purchasing this product. Their support site doesn't even list the error code I was getting! They list some of the error codes, just not the ones I was getting, very frustrating."
1,Not worth the cheap paper it's printed on,"I bought this set for my son thinking it would be a good introduction to the classics. They arrived, I opened them up and discovered that ""illustrated"" means a couple of poor quality prints on extremely cheap paper. In addition, the books are so cheap that one came apart just from being opened. O.K., so I didn't buy it completely for the pictures, so we pulled out King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table figuring that would be a great story. I think Cliff's notes would be more interesting. The editing essentially left us with ""King Arthur went here, King Arthur left, Sir Somebody cut of someone's head, etc. etc."" Continuity of the story? Who needs that? Well, only someone trying to figure out what's going on and why. In short, the books are not worth it on so many counts that I would strongly discourage anyone from spending their money on them."
4,Third Person Singular,"I chose this boo because I was born and raised in Mineapolis and all the places were amiliar to me wic was fun. In act, my sster lived on the same street as the victim. I would like more of them, like ""Alone at Night"" whch I hear is very good as well. Wel wrten and lots of twists and turnThird Person Singular"
2,Shows a lot of promise but has a cliche ending.,"This was a pretty engrossing novel with great characters and a terrific setting that got totally destroyed for me by the cliche ending. When I got to the part in the book, about 50 or so pages before the end, where I could see which direction the author was headed, I was horrified. I quickly flipped through the last pages in denial (""She isn't REALLY going to do that is she?""), saw I was right, and gave up on finishing. However, in Erickson's defense: this is her first novel and it shows a lot of promise. I'll definitely look for the next one, but if I were you, I'd skip this one altogether. Not recommended to anyone who is a mystery fan and hates it when, figuratively speaking, ""the butler did it."""
3,"A good book, minus the eight year old","The first chapter grabbed my attention. I settled in for a good read, but was already disappointed in the second chapter. I just couldn't like the 8 year old kid. His father lets him read IN COLD BLOOD. I read that book years ago and it gave me nightmares. Detective Mars Bahr should worry that he might have to arrest his own son someday, the boy is so eager to see a dead body! Other than that, I liked the book and will look forward to reading another by this author, but not until I get a little preview to see if the child gets some psychiatric help."
4,Good cable,"I used it for my FAX machine. The twelve foot length was perfect for me as ten foot would be to short, and anything over twelve feet would have been a waste."
1,PIECE OF CRAP - NO STARS,"the ""motorola"" car charger that i bought from you is UNAUTHORIZED whatever that means, so my phone wont accept a charge from it. no wonder it was so cheap. i'm surprised you would sell something so obviously crap. what a waste of S&H."
2,ice bucket review,"Received this as a gift. It is real classy looking but very small. So ok, you have just a few friends over for drinks- evem then I question functionality??- The cover is very difficult to replace securely and it is not insulated, so how well will it work???"
5,Sacred Service-Great Recording,"I first heard this work performed by the NY Philharmonic over the radio in 1960 when the NY Philharmonic concerts were broadcast live. I was blown away, and then got it in LP, which I played to destruction, and finally this CD. The performances are first-rate and still move me almost 50 years later. If you have any interest, you can't go wrong. The other works with this are OK, but not my cup of tea."
1,Failed within 6 Months,I purchased this LCD for my kids computer at Christmas and it has failed within 6 months. Shame on me for saving a couple of bucks instead of a Viewsonic or Samsung.
2,A book with a quick glance at apple cider vinegar.,The book is overall a general advertisement and mishmash of different possibilities towards healthful living. I expected a much more thorough work on apple cider vinegar and its effects on health. In reality the contents of this ~100 page book which are relevant to the title could easily be placed on a booklet of a few pages. Considering the price I paid for this book I feel jipped. Having said that I do feel that the few informational pages were worth reading (though you could easily get the same info off the internet for the price of a phone call).
5,"Raw, unfiltered apple cider vinegar","The info in this book is excellent. It is very thorough and informative. I have been on the vinegar cocktail for a couple months now and am feeling more energetic, have less hip pain, and am gradually losing weight. I love it!"
2,Hard to Read,"There may be good information in this book but the layout, and so many testimonials, made it so difficult to find, I gave up."
1,Read the review by Victor V. Popov.,Read the review posted on 9/30/06 titled VERY SIMPLE. It will give the you all you need to know about this book.
2,Not what I expected,This book was not what I expected. There was a little useful information but it was not very well organized and it was laid out very poorly.
3,Very simple,"I honestly don't think there was a need to write a book for other than the fact that you cant sell a 1 page book. To summarzize this book for you, drink 2 heaping teaspoons of raw honey, 2 teaspoons of RAW apple cider vinegar only the kind from healthstores that has the live enzymes and a glass of water mix it together and sip it. Drink 3 of these a day for the rest of your life. That is the book in a nutshell. The rest of the book they try to encorporate bragg lifestyle principles as well as other uses for vinegar like clenaing the stove etc. I wish someone had summed it up for me."
5,This should be taught in every school,"Like most Americans, I slid from one greasy meal to the next. It wasn't until I got a wake-up call from a doctor that made me change. I began realize the importance of water and the dangers in tap water. The Braggs are living proof that we do have at least some control of our destiny. The book is dense with information, and I found that every time I picked it up, some other gem of wisdom found its way into my consciousness. I understand Paul Bragg was a constantly smiling, robust man who was killed while swimming in rough seas at age 96. I met Patricia and was amazed at her boundless energy. A bad lifestyle for so many years may prevent me from living to 120, but I'm halfway there and getting stronger thanks to Patricia and Paul Bragg. I recommend this book for anyone who really cares about life and living it to the max"
3,Add a little apple cider vinegar to the rest of your book,"'Apple Cider Vinegar Miracle Health System' includes ways to benefit from the use of vinegar. It appears that 1/4 of this book includes vinegar remedies and the rest of this book contains advertisements for all of the other reading material by the author.Although much of the advice and advertisements of Bragg's reading materials, health food products and retreat locations was enlightening and informative, the main body of the book should have been conducive to the title.If one is seeking a more complete book remedies and benefits of apple cider vinegar then perhaps he should research other books on the subject as well"
2,Ok,I'm ok w thi this book. But pretty much everything you want to know is available on line. Take vinegar 3 x day
5,Apple Cider Vinegar Miracle Health System Book,Interesting information and very helpful. Some ideas sound like ideas my aunt used to talk about. Am keeping it handy for easy reference.
2,Wheres the proof?,I agree that it helps heartburn. I do know however that vinegar contains Aflotoxin produced by mold from the apples. This is hard on the liver. If youre going to drink the stuff add some vitamin C powder to it.
2,Heavy on the biblical references,Some useful health tips and recipes for vinegar and honey etc. I found the information a bit repetitive. A lot of the basic information was presented over and over again. I personally could have done without so many Christian bible references. If you are Christian you may like it.
1,No supported studies,"I'm annoyed that I even wasted the couple hours on this book. There was a lot of information about ACV and its uses but they don't reference any studies or fact. Just quotes from other people familiar with the Bragg system. They tout Potassium as being really high and that's the main benefit but eating a banana will get you more without the gross taste. The book appeared to be one long advertisement to me to buy their products. Patricia isn't even Paul's daughter and he only lived to 81.There is plenty of research out there for ACV and its effective uses, not all of those listed in the book have been proven. In fact, there is significant research that I found that says certain people should NOT drink ACV and it can actually be Potassium wasting since it works as a diuretic.My take- stick to the science and not the Bragg billboard."
2,Self-Promoting,"I took Ms. Bragg's advice in this book to take apple cider vinegar for yeast-candida with painfully disasterous results. And yes, I used her brand of apple cider vinegar."
1,Apple Cider Vinegar Messed Up My Skin,Do not drink apple cider vinegar. It created heat within my system and messed up the skin on my face and gave me terrible melasma. It's now going to take months for it to go away.
4,Interesting Book,"Apple Cider Vinegar is good for so many things. This book goes into them and also has testimonials. My family and I can attest to how good this can be for you on a daily basis. Great product. Best on the market. Apple Cider vinegar everyday is so good for many, many things. Fast delivery and great service."
4,Interesting,"Always looking for a book to justify my love of vinegar, I found this book fascinating. Despite the fact they may be promoting their own apple cider vinegar brand, it truly is the best one out there. Anyone reading this will rush out to buy their own bottle, I promise!"
2,Wouldn't buy it again,I was very disappointed in the quality of this book. The information was very informative but I felt the book was poorly written.
1,REplay value? How about some INITIAL play value?,"Okay, considering the makers of the destruction league series seem to put in minimal effort and time to make these games, I think I should reciprocate. The game stinks, it's a knockoff of a knockoff that's a knockoff in the vehicular destruction genre. The only thing somewhat unique is the use of planes. Anybody who says otherwise is either a lobotomy patient or a zealot of the series. The End"
4,Quality product.,These wires are quality. I tried to build my own but they never sounded great. These wires do sound great and they're a heavy gauge wire. The only problem is the banana plug ends are connected so you can't bridge.
1,Book Condition Poor,"This book had many, many highlighted pages, of which was not described in the condition description. I would have returned it, but it would have costed more than I paid for the book."
2,Poor spacing of device connectors,"I wanted to locate my 2 IDE DVD devices high in my full tower case. The standard 18"" cable length is not sufficient to achieve this purpose. A 36"" cable seemed to be the perfect solution. NOT SO. The cable as sent had one connector located at the 36"" position and one at ~ 20"". Seems to me this defeats the whole purpose of a long cable."
2,"very worn out, ex library copy","The seller had stated it was in very good condition but it is very worn out and an ex library copy with some filler pages removed. That said, it is a good book, I just wish I had bought a used copy from a different seller."
1,8 year old girl,This book was so boring. It doesn't even have a good ending. It is totally not worth even checking out at the library. The book drags on. And the freaky part keeps talking about some red eye in a black misty form and it's gross. There's nothing good about this book.
3,A little disappointed,"This book is about a young girl named Arianna (Ari), who is sent to the ""real"" world with her unicorn Sunchaser (Chase). On the way Ari and Chase are in an accident that causes Ari to break both of her legs and to have slight amnesia, and Chase to lose his horn, which makes him lose his power. Once Ari is better her foster parents make her lease Chase to a rich snob so they can pay for Ari's hospital bills. Ari then has to try to remember everything, and find her and Chase's way back to Balinor.Overall this was a pretty good book, but not my type. I do think that the author is an excellent writer, and I will continue to read other books by her."
5,A wonderful fantasy book,I just could not put it down - I loved it. It was so mysterious. How Chase could talk to Ari! It was so fun! I could name so many good words about this book I just had to put 5 stars down. I can guarantee you'll love it. I can't wait to read #2.
5,Beautifully written,""" The Road to Balinor"" is a great book filled with descriptive writing and the power of friendship. When I read this book I really felt what Ari was going through. Ari couldn't let her horse-friend, Chase into the hands of Lori Carmicheals. Lori treats animals very cruely as if they are not living things. Ari's family is broke and really needs the money from leasing Chase to the rich Carmicheals. Though Ari isn't going to give up her good friend that easily to a person who will hurt him. This book was powerfully written and reminds people how strong friendship is. When I read this book it gave me so much inspiration I knew I could write a story and hoped it would be as wonderful as this one."
5,Your friends and family live in this entertaining book,"From the moment you read the first chapters, you will be able to feel, hear, smell and see this story unfolding in your mind's eye. The characters are either family members or someone you know. It's as if Randal Patrick was raised in your neighborhood and he knows everyone you do and how they talk. You will recognize everyone in this book. As you are reading you will catch yourself smiling and wondering how Randal Patrick heard that conversation from your past. The book is most entertaining. Enjoy!!!!"
4,Wonderfully written,"There's none in the county, or none in the state...that can weave such a full-bodied tale of the lives of southern white trash."
4,"Funny, sad",The writing style was super and the characters believable. You can't help but be involved with them. It's funny and sad all at the same time.
2,"That's it, I'm done.","I've had this disc since it came out and didn't care for it right from the beginning.It sat around for a few weeks and I thought I'd give it another listen or two; still nothing.It sat around for a year; again, nothing. I just gave it another try to see if there were any tracksthat I might want to include on my ipod with other great junkie stuff from earlier days and againI couldn't find one track that I felt compelled to include. Don't misunderstand me, I own and love almost all of their stuff, but this one just isn't that good. It's not horrible; it just sits there and doesn't get noticed. You might consider saving your money on this one; buy anything before Open and you should be satisfied."
2,True Fan Disappointed,"From the Whites Off Earth Now until just the other day, I've defended the CJs as the finest talents contemporary music has to offer. Truth be told, though, their last two studio albums have been disappointments. ""Open,"" however, represents a new low for the band. Every single one of the tracks is, for lack of a better term, over-played. Noisy. Their strong points always have been Margo's vocals and Michael's lyrics. On Open, however, both are drowned out by noxious guitar chords and irrelevant background noise. Sadly, the lyrics do not compensate for the CD's other short-comings. Buy Lay It Down and Trinity Sessions in order to appreciate the band. Open is a crushing disappointment. I waited three years for this? But I'll still go out of my way to see them in concert every chance I get. Everyone's entitled to a bad CD or two."
3,LOVED the last 5 songs,"The first 5 cuts were dismal. Too similar, and very vocally weak for the Junkies. The final 5 were classic Cowboy Junkies music and worth the price of the CD for these five alone."
5,Lovely piece of work,"At first listen, I was taken aback just like most of the other reviewers. Margo's voice was lost within all the fuzz of the guitars, and the mix was just too loud. When I finally got the time to sit down and play the record from start to finish, I was surprisingly stunned. This record must be taken as a whole body of work to appreciate the creativity and uniqueness. The beginning is dark and noisy, and eventually gives way to Margo's sweet, honey voice and the band's lovely melodies/lyrics. I absolutely love ""Bread and Wine"", ""I'm So Open"", and ""Small Swift Birds"". If given a chance, this record shines brightly. Sit back and relax and let the Junkies take you on a sublime trip, from darkness of sound to lightness of voice."
1,CJ flops,"I'm a Cowboy Junkies fan. I think the new ""Open"" CD is miserable.I heard 'I saw your shoes' live, and the lead-in was incredible; great guitar work. The track on the 'Waltz across America' CD is not as good as live, but I still thought to myself ""I hope they do more stuff like this.""Well, I should have been more careful, because with 'Open' I got what I wanted and it is not good. The first few tracks sound like they were recorded over a partially erased tape with the guys messing around as the underlying layer.As a benchmark, to help you weigh my opinion, my favorite CJ tracks are 'Hold on to me' and 'Blue Guitar' (from 'Lay it down' and 'Miles from our home').I seems extremely unlikely that 'Open' will grow on me."
2,"No...., sorry","Been a fan ever since I heard Margo sing 'Sun comes up', and thought they were fabulous when they released the 'Black-Eyed'-cd. Still love the tracks of that time... But since then, there have been few high-lights. We've had 'live' and 'B-sides' (an appropriate title). Should have been a 'greatest hits' to finish it all.To me, this new cd really is for 75%just uninspired, unorganised, freakin' noise. I'd rather label it 'Hard-rock'... examples: 'Dragging', 'Did it all', 'Dark hole', get worse each time you hear them.Give us back the quiet and fragile atmosphere of the old Junkies, please. Like on '1000 year prayer' and 'beneath the gate', those 2 are ok. Put those 2 on their forthcoming 'Greatest Hits', and 'Open' can be dumped.Sorry."
2,Disappointing release from a great band,"I own 8 CJ albums, and this is my LEAST FAVORITE. After Lay it Down and Pale Sun Crescent Moon, the band released Miles from Our Home, which had some very solid and powerful tracks but was a step down from the almost flawless previous albums. Then came ""Open""-all I can say is that the distorted and noisesome guitars and feedback are grating and sonically destroy what is best about the CJs. I listened to this album several times when I got it and occasionally try to put it in again--but it is really just an unpleasant album with no strong melodic content. I do hope the CJs return to their more sparse and haunting sound..."
1,Complete letdown,"I've been a CJ fan for several years now. Have enjoyed every CJ CD I've come across. First time I played Open, I thought there was either something wrong with the CD or with my sound system. Unfortunately, I determined CD and sound system were fine. I was so disappointed with this latest CJ effort I sent the CD back for a refund."
1,Change isn't always good. Disappointing.,"When Miles From Our Home was release I suspected that the CBJs were taking a different directon, and Open confirms my suspicions. I was very disappointed with this recording. This is the last CBJ recording I'll buy without hearing it first. Off to the used CD store with this one... and Miles From Our Home along with it."
2,Their music deserves better treatment than this!,"The poor sound quality of this recording makes it hard to listen to the music. It sounds like the microphones were wrapped in wet towels and buried inside the bass drum. Grossly exaggerated bass and distant muddy vocals - why is it that nobody cares enough to make sure a singer sounds like a singer and a cymbal sounds like a cymbal? It's definitely not a matter of money or equipment needed - I've heard fantastic recordings made by local bands at very low cost. I don't know whether to blame the engineer, producer or band, but somebody needs a kick in the butt. I love a lot of the Cowboy Junkies music, but I don't think I'll be playing this album very often."
2,Drowning Margo,"Ok. There are a couple of options for the Cowboy Junkies.1: They tone down the band so we can hear Margo.2: They set Margo solo [with the tender lyrics of Michael Timmins in hand].Perhaps I'm too prejudice. I love the early stuff, the slow songs, the songs where we can still hear Margo singing those beautiful, thoughtful and lucid lyrics. But somewhere along the line, perhaps ""Lay Me Down,"" the band began to drown Margo."
2,A Real Letdown,"This seems like an expansion of all the weak material on ""Miles From Our Home"" - the vocals are inaudible, the guitars are too loud and out of tune, and there's no discernible direction to most of the songs. The first six, and the last couple, sound like the Grateful Dead on a night when they can't find a groove. ""Small Swift Birds"" is nice, and ""I'm so Open"" is OK, but otherwise there isn't a single song on this that I'd ever want to hear done live. This really makes me wonder whether Michael Timmins is jealous of his sister's success and wanted to smother her contributions with junky space music. Very disappointing."
1,i trusted them...,"i own and love all cowboy junkie music. i bought their latest release based on this only to be very disappointed. it's a messy record, not worthy of repeat play."
2,What has happened to my favorite group???,"Suddenly we've got all this instrumental weirdness -- what's up with that? This CD does its best to hide Margo's immense talent. There is not a single track on this CD worthy of Sweet Jane or Misguided Angel, for example. If you haven't heard Cowboy Junkies before, let me suggest that you purchase the Trinity Sessions or one of their older CDs instead. And, Cowboy Junkies, if you're reading this, please go back to your wonderful old sound. You're the best! And Margo, to love the Cowboy Junkies is to love you -- so come back to us as you were."
1,"Yep, JUNK is an appropriate term!","I'm a hardcore fan of this band, but what a waste. I read the bad reviews, but figured, ""It can't be THAT bad."" Well, yes it can and it is. The mixes are horrible. Gone are the acoustic sounds that have made the band one of my favorites. If you are into a far more electric sound with awful mixes, then you'll probably enjoy this CD. Otherwise, go pop in an old Junkies CD and save your money. I listened ONE time. The CD is going into my rack, or to the used CD store. And it's a shame because I still love this band when they're making the music that only they can make."
5,Awesome Historical Overview of the Blues,"Imagine having some of the most remarkable and influential musicians of all time all together in your own living room. The Blues Story PBD Special tells the history of one of the richest and oldest art forms in America This DVD captures the essence of the blues rare footage of interviews, and of course leaving the music to tell the stories themselves. This DVD follows the development of this art form from it's African roots to how it influences modern urban music that we hear today. The DVD Feature such Blues greats such as Snooky Pryor, Ruth Brown and B.B. King. I found this DVD to be views as a captivating rich history lesson and an inside glimpse of the lives of the poor and oppressed from which the Blues originated. It is an interesting and provocative choice for people of all ages. I actually enjoyed this documentary better than the Marin Scorsese produced special."
2,Not what I expected!,I was VERY disapointed in this DVD as I was expeting more of a concert from Kenny Wayne as I have seen him in concert many times and he always puts on a good show...I may sell this on Amazon or GIVE it away as I was taken in by the other reviews...Sir Lawrence of Breck...
1,Very unhappy w seller and poor item description,"Item description tells of a complete wheelbarrow and not just a tub shown in the picture. Going on the description and judging by the price i figured that the item was complete. Low and behold. Not the case... I contacted the seller via Amazon to try to complete the wheelbarrow or to try to return the item. What i got was great difficulty from the seller. They finally agreed to take the item back with a 15% restocking fee. Wait, you want to charge me for your bad listing. What a headache. I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER!!!!! Not worth the headache"
4,Underrated Gem!!!!,"THE ENTITY is easily one of the most unfairly maligned films ever made. Most critics take exception to the frankness in which the ""rape"" scenes are depicted, deeming them sensationalistic and trashy. Well sorry folks. To drive home the terror that this women is feeling, I think its appropriate to show us in a brutal fashinon exactly what is happening to her.The acting is top notch. Barbara Hershy is fantastic, hands down!The material is treated incredibly seriously and it contains some great music and truly moody cinematography! Granted, the finale is a little out of control, but lets not forget THE EXORCIST. A classic that spends most of its screen time out of control.I wont rattle on and anilyze it too much. If you havent seen it, give it a go. You will no doubt be want to leave the lights on....."
4,I REEEALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE IT AGAIN!,"This movie truly freaked me out with its terrifying psychological plot when I first saw it at 22-years old while living in a new place. During the film ""something"" crashed in my bedroom and neither me nor my roommates would investigate. I ended up staying in the living room that night.Just a few months ago, I came across the Entity and decided to stay up and watch to see if it still scared me. Well...even as I write this short review, I am struggling not to hear the thundering sound effects of the attacks and (yikes!) YES! I didn't want to go up to bed after seeing this film even all these years later. I also don't wish to view this movie a third time, however I know I probably will. There is nothing like a great mind-fright!"
4,"For some reason, this movie scared the [heck] out of me","The Entity is not a great movie. It tends to drag throughout much of the second half and the ending was a disappointment in my opinion. However, this movie continues to scare the heck out of me! Now I have seen many a horror flick and not many of them succeed in generating so much as a shiver. But for some reason, this movie really scares me. The scene where Barbara Hershey is first attacked by the unseen Entity while lying on her bed, the horrible scene where she is literally molested by invisible hands, and the chilling voice that welcomes her home after her climactic encounter with the violent poltergeist continues to send chills down my spine. This is not a movie I would watch before going to bed or taking a bath!"
3,I Expected to be scared.... Probably scary for the era in which it was made.,What scared viewers ( at least this viewer ) in the 70s and 80s now seems like a cheesy attempt at horror. I didn't pay much so I'm not too disappointed.
3,No English subtitle,Today I got this new movie and watched it but i doesn't have English subtitle. I checked and it said English subtitle. I am disappointed and told other friends about it.
1,"Could of been an original copyright,if I would have known","I purchase this dvd through VideoUniverse.com and had gotten ripped off for the price I paid for it.They said it was new copy of it and ended being a homemade which sucks that I gotten ripped off.Please do not order this movie through them as Video Universe with Hollywood Block,if you do get this movie!!!"
1,BOOOOOORING,"My friends rented this to watch one night (they always pick the worst movies- every time) and yes, we know rape's not funny, but we couldn't help laughing at most of the movie. Why is it getting 4 1/2 stars? This is bad. The little girls weren't even good enough to act in a bad commercial, the music sounded like some early childhood Trent Reznor project, the actor who played the son was a cheeseball and wore nothing but booty shorts, the psychiatrist guy was a total jerk and really annoyed me, Barbara Hershey overacted, the plot was totally obvious (if it gets too boring and quiet in comes the ""scary"" music and you know she's gonna get assaulted in one way or another), not to mention the grody fake body they used when she was getting felt up by the ghost (but when you realize this was 1982, the effect was pretty good). I know it's a true story and all, but jeez."
4,"Bizzare, Repugnant and Fascinating","A tale about a woman's sanity and safety. Barbara Hershey plays it complex and nuanced as the soundtrack literally pounds away at her. It's the Jimmy Carter era of white plastic, pop psycology, ...[low cost] cars, [and working moms...]"
4,The Entity is a trip!,"I read the book, and watched the movie when it came out. I beleive I like the movie better now than then! It also has a real beauty staring in it!!!!!!!!"
3,I remember this movie being a little more scary years ago.,Still love the movie but Blue ray really brings out the special defects in the movie. Barbra Hershey is still hot though! Lol
5,The entity,Loved it. Kinda scary and crazy. I have seen this movie several times. I enjoy older movies better than I do the newer ones. Now I have it in my collection.
4,Makes you afraid to sleep,"I found this film about the supernatural to be very interesting.BarbaraHershey plays a single mother who is assaulted several times by an unseenforce,including once in front of her children.This film is one that willgive you goosebumps,and a reason to wonder if you are safe in your house."
2,Ridiculous Supernatural Chiller,"The Entity is about a ghost that rapes a woman repeatedly. Which is ironic, since after watching it I feel like my time had been raped. There are a few chills and thrills, but there's also a lot of dull stretches where nothing interesting happens. And the plot, supposedly based on a true story, is ridiculous. They should have made a sequel where the ghost turns gay and repeatedly rapes a man. They could have called it ""The Entity 2: Supernatural Homosexual"". It would have been more entertaining than The Entity."
3,Barbara Hershey can do no wrong...,"Single California mom Barbara Hershey, living in a comfy ramshackle house with her brood, is sexually assaulted one night by a poltergeist. After repeated similar attacks (one while she's driving!), Hershey seeks help from para-psychologists. Having Tobe Hooper's more mainstream and slick ""Poltergeist"" come out on this movie's heels certainly wasn't good for its legacy, and promoting the film as a true story didn't wash with skeptics, but having an actress of Hershey's caliber at the film's center was a superlative move; her presence alone makes the film absorbing and provocative. Appearing like a grown-up flower child, with a likably tossled hairdo and lifestyle, Hershey slips right into these outlandish goings-on with nonchalant ease. The effects are quite good (relying upon tight editing and fine cinematography), and the climactic events don't cop out. This thriller goes in all the directions you're hoping it will, and it is never less than satisfying. 'B'"
4,A superior horror film,"Tales of the supernatural are some of the hardest to make effective and believable. ""The Entity"" doesn't really accomplish both of these things to its full potential, but man is it great! Barbara Hershey turns in a very heartfelt performance as a single mom who's had some pretty traumatic experiences in her life that are the basis for her shrink's accusations of delusions when she begins to feel some sort of entity sexually assault her in her own house. The sequences of rape by an un-earthly force are extremely effective, and the pitter-patter in between isn't bad, either. In my opinion the doctor played by Ron Silver completely underminds the movie in a way that's indescribably annoying, but it's the strength of the Hershey character, the incredible special effects, and the shocking nature of the rape sequences that put this movie over the top. I loved it. However, a word of warning to the squeamish: If ""The Accused"" disturbed you, this will tear your nerves to shreds."
5,Good old fashioned horror,"Ive been looking for this movie on dvd for awhile, finally found it. Wish the price was a bit cheaper, since this is a older moive, but still if your into horror, or paranormal this one is worth watching."
3,Enjoyable older horror/terror flick,"I was scanning over the list of movies available at Amazon.com and noticed this one. I saw it many years ago when it came out in the theaters. Supposedly based on actual happenings of a woman being sexually assaulted, or raped by a demonic presence in her life. It is a good movie, most likely enjoyed more by fans of the 70's - 80's terror movies. It is a good buy price-wise to anyone wanting to add to their movie collection."
3,Ghost Porn?,"Good rentable flick with lots of nudity and some of the most unbelievable ghost copping-a-feel special effects you have ever seen. Hershey portrays a victimized woman in an unimaginable situation with grace and passion. I would also add ""dignity"" but since she is forced to get naked every five minutes it really doesn't apply here. She's a classy actress who deserved a good bit better than what she got in this screenplay. Its interesting how powerful the Entity is made to be, yet we are led squeamishly but completely through the harrowing torture and repeated rape of Hershey's character because she radiates more power than anyone else. Its Hershey's convincing performance that makes this a level above what could have ended up as a really schlocky horror film. Some of the scenes are really quite harrowing and effective. With less repetition and gratuitous nudity (wow, am I really saying that ?) the movie's dramatic and horrific impact would be a lot greater."
2,The Entity,"The Entity is a true story about a mother who is raped by a ghost. People try to figure out what is going with her and the film just takes way to long. I love 80's horror movies but this one is boring. When the ghost arrives it sounds like techno music. Don't bother with the blu ray as it contains just the film, not even a measly menu. The dvd has a menu, a trailer, and a documentary over the case. I'd avoid this movie."
4,The Entity,We really enjoyed the movie- more so because it's based on a true story. It's too bad people are considered mentally challenged before any investigation to prove a person them sabe
4,entity,"this was a movie that was good back then , and still a good one to watch with your friends.break out the popcorn and enjoy with the lights out. not too scary by todays standards, but a frightening thought to think things like this can exist.have fun and enjoy!"
5,An excellent portrayal,"An excellent suspense/horror film. I still recommend it to various people even though the cinematography is a trifle dated by today's standards.It's only glaring inaccuracy is that in the end of the move and the novel the entity is shown as being immobilized. In the actual Culver City haunting that the story is loosely based on, no such amazing event occurred and the entity continued to follow the woman even years later.Personally, I think the truth would have been a more chilling end to the movie, but obviously the producers of the time didn't feel it would be either appropriate or marketable.Still, an all time favourite and highly recommended. Tense and scary even in comparison to modern day movies!"
4,A primer worth owning,"This book is a little distracting because it groups descriptions of trees by their scientific name, which sort of promises a thorough examination of each type of tree, but this book is not very comprehensive in its coverage of either the species it covers or the species readily available to the home gardener. This book has good information on garden design and sincerely beautiful photos. I am consistently happy with any gardening book from this publisher, and although this book provides little more than a cursory overview, it does contain helpful information and attractive illustrations."
2,Really disappointing,"Well, there's nothing ""Complete"" in this book. Yes, you will find a very good index of trees, shurbs & hedges. Yes, you will see nice pictures for everyone. And yes, you will get some details about each species. But that's about all you'll get. Each specie has 1-2 pages allocated to it. And that includes pictures. So you can imagine how much information there is. It's kinda like a bread book would say ""in order to make bread mix flour and water and bake in the oven"".Try the ""Surpise me!"" feature from the Amazon Online Reader to check different sections in the book."
1,Do not purchase this Cello!!!,"I purchased this Cello for my daughter who has been playing Cello for three years in Middle School. First it did not ship on time so we didn't have it for the beginning of school. Second, the Hard Case has been discontinued so it came with a Soft Case. Third, the strings would not stay tight long enough to play it. Fourth, there are no fine tuners to get it in tune if the strings would stay tight. After my daughter and her orchestra instructor couldn't make it work, I took it to a local musical instrument shop who quoted $250.00 to make it playable. The only valid use of this product that I can think of is for a stage prop. Fifth, after returning the Cello (and paying for return shipping), I had to fight with Austin Bazaar for a full refund. They claimed that it was not defective and charged a $50.00 restocking fee. Amazon A-Z Protection was very helpful in resolving the refund."
3,Explorations of the Rockets...,"The Deluxtone Rockets have adopted a new sound on Green Room Blues, with more rockabilly and less swing. With no horn section, the band sounds different and their lyrics have taken a great leap from their debut. In addition to a new sound, the band has two new members and although they are still called the Deluxtone Rockets, they seem to be a new group. Overall, the songs are enjoyable, but sometimes it seems the band is exploring too many different kinds of music all at the same time. This makes the album a little choppy, but lets the listener see the Deluxtone Rockets experiment in areas they hadn't before."
2,Manufacturer Response,"Santa Claus brought this gift however during all the excitment the directions were lost. I have been trying ever since to get a response from the manufacturer. (Trying to replace the instructions) I have used their customer service email address - no response. I have been on hold for 2 business days then finally left a message and never heard back from them. I honestly cannot rate the toy as we have not ""played"" the game yet for lack of instructions.Very disappointed in the manufacturer especially considering the price.North Carolina"
5,a suprize around every corner,"RAY YA DID IT AGAIN DISC #2 i listen passivley till ya grabed my ear and said listen hear. and i did over,over &OVER AGAIN,& again and then inspiration struck like a big ol'e mack truck you keep on a written those sweet melodies and i'll do my best to keep written great lyric's to your great songs the wordsmith13 is hot on your trail and ready to whale drop a dime wordsmith13@msn.com"
5,A superb piece of history,"This is the second book I read about the Black Death of 1347-51. I was equally impressed with the way Gottfried presented his materials. The author also examines several other diseases that were common in those days, and takes a scientific look at the bacillus that infected fleas and, eventually, the rodents that spread the epidemic. Thoroughly researched (look at his bibliography), this is a terrific book for anyone wanting to know not only about the Black Death but also about its aftermath in Europe (it shaped and changed the future of Europe). I would rank this book with Philip Ziegler's classic ""The Black Death."""
3,reasonably interesting but i have doubt about author's research,it appears that the author is definitely english speaking. he appears to find english record of black death more detailed. whereas he keeps saying in the book that other non-english speaking country have bad record of the black death. i would like to question perhaps he couldnt find the record because he couldnt speak their languages?i think it more prudent to say instead. the author didnt find the record instead of the record does not exist. more scientific approach dont you think?
2,Playing Cards,It's too simple and isn't really good for helping to learning. It should be more creative. Too bad of this Cards!
4,Great for Casual Home use,"I bought this a month ago for home use, and find it fabulous. My only complaint and reason for giving it 4 stars is that it is a little bit large and therefore you can't just fill it up on something like a Margarita or you'll have too much sour. I wouldn't want to use this at work! And, being myself a bartender, I would like to say that I have used a good number of different shakers, and have never seen one that had a lid that just popped off, shakers don't do this. Lids stick because the air inside compresses due to the cold and seals the lid tightly. I have also never seen one that screwed off. It is impractical anyways, it is not hard to see if you're on or off. Anywho, hope this is helpful. Happy shaking!"
2,Has pluses but one big minus...,"This shaker looks very attractive and works well, EXCEPT that the removable top invariably fails to be removable. Once the shaker gets cold, the metal contracts and the pieces stick together, making it a real pain to get the two pieces back apart for washing or for ""martinis, round 2""...and the problem doesn't abate once the shaker warms up---once it's stuck, it's stuck. It's true that if you take it apart IMMEDIATELY it doesn't stick, but I forget to do so at least 50% of the time (usually when there are guests present and I have other things to think about). I have had this shaker for about 3 months and make martinis pretty regularly, but I'm tired of messing with it: I've decided to buy another shaker and give this one to GoodWill!"
