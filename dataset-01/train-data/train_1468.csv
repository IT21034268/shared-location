5,Introduction to Shoshoni Language,An introduction to one of the lesser known languages of native culture. This volume is accompanied by a set of tapes that make it clear and consise. An easy to read and understand volume with glossaries from Shoshoni to English and English to Shoshoni. It is volumes like this that will keep native languages from becoming extinct.
2,falls short,"I must agree with the other reviews. The photographs in this book are gorgeous, but the recipes fall short and miss vital steps. For example, none of the recipes call for the initial no-refrigeration period so that the kimchis can properly ferment. I now find myself very frustrated that I have been missing this step for so long, due to this book's shortcomings.I suggest instead The Book of Kimchi which also features wonderful photos, somewhat clearer instructions, and in some cases step-by-step photos which are so important for the first-timer."
5,Excellent book!,"Kim-chee is not something people will like the first time they try it. You have to get your tastebuds used to the flavour. And once you learn how to appreciate this delicacy, you'll get hook on it. This is book contains excellent recipies for making kim-chee at home. If you're into korean food or interested in trying something different and bold, here's a book you should take a look at."
2,Incomplete,Doesn't tell you how to make kimchi from start to finish. Doesn't fully explain fermentation process among other things. Sizes are ridiculous. Why would I use five pounds of cabbage?
5,!!!!SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!,"Hey,,That purse is so cute im gettin a pink one and black one from here fo school i love it"
4,A CHEEZY GOOD TIME.,"I have to admit I'm a sucker when it comes to bad b-movie horror , and this happens to be one that I actually enjoy and have watched twice so far. I first came across this on amazon when going in to a search for horror movies and found it listed as "" MOVIE HOUSE MASSACRE"" on VHS and than "" THEATER OF BLOOD "" on DVD and is kind of odd that the movie lists two different directors and really no facts on when it was made or any of the characters , but the plot is fairly simple when a movie theatre owner becomes upset that movie sales are down and kills the usher than burns down the theatre with everyone trapped in. Many years later a whole chain of theatres open with young people hired as employees , and the acting throughout is amateurish but somewhat humorous which is what I enjoyed most about the movie , and would have to recommend this only for b- movie horror enthusiast like myself."
2,Dark in DC,The writer is obsessed with old cars and old music a la the '50's â€“ not a match for me.
4,Back to the 60's with Derek Strange,"Much as ""The Big Blowdown"" took us back into the past of another set of Pelecanos' characters, ""Hard Revolution"" introduces us to the Sixties in the company of Derek Strange. Though not as searing as some of the DC-based crime novels in his body of work so far, ""Hard Revolution"" is a strong novel you won't want to miss--especially if you've read the other Derek Strange novels."
2,Long and slow-going,"The author went on and on and on in setting up the story. The description of racial hatred, sociopathy, and wasted lives took up half of the book. By the time something happened,I had grown tired of the whole thing. The description of period cars and music seemed too contrived in an attempt to set the mood. This wasn't my type of book, I guess, and I'll avoid this author in the future."
4,Semi hard revolution,"First let me say I eagerly awaited this ""prequel"" and had been a little disappointed with the earlier Soul Circus. I 've read Hell to Pay & Right as Rain. The early part of the current novel which features the key characters in their youth is fine and yes I thought of Richard Price's work covering the Bronx of my youth.Ultimately I'm a little disappointed with the tale, the last remarks about Frank Vaughn and the selective morality and plain old believability.It will be interesting to see if GP takes one last shot with Derek. I'll bet yes."
3,"Good, but Pelecanos has done better.","I love George Pelecanos, but Hard Revolution wasn't as good as his previous work. The brutal violence and harrowing villians take a backseat to the music and movies of the era (1968), which Pelecanos drops with an astounding and mildly irritating regularity. I'm not necessarily interested in what 6 songs a characters listens to in his car before he commits a crime. Maybe it's because I was born in '74 and can't relate to the period, but this novel wasn't as involving or affecting as either Hell to Pay or Right as Rain. But even mediocre Pelecanos is better than a lot of the drivel currently being published by crime novelists."
4,How does he know this stuff?,"The best writer of black crime fiction is white. Pelecanos knows stuff that no other white person knows and stuff that no black would ever tell a white. How does he know this stuff? While other writers may have black characters they do not have the right voice so most don't even try. Pelecanos is different. Not only does his voice ring true, it is true. This novel introduces us to the young Derek Strange. Although technically a crime novel, there is precious little sleuthing here. Rather, Pelecanos wants us to know and feel how close this nation came to being ripped apart by Viet Nam and civil rights. This is strong stuff. Highly recommended."
5,"Oh yeah, some good stuff here!!!","In the summer of 2002, news spread like wildfire about the new band started by former ZAO vocalist - Shawn Jonas. That band was Symphony In Peril, and in their debut release ""Lost Memoirs And Faded Pictures"" has become one of the most anticipated releases ever put out on Facedown! This record is sure to bring Shawn Jonas out from the ""former ZAO vocalist"" shadow and is guaranteed to establish Symphony in Peril as one of the finest bands in today's metalcore scene. My personal favorite track is Portrait. For fans of ZAO, you guys really do need to check this out."
4,some of the best hardcore I've heard,"To begin with, I am not a huge fan of hardcore. I'm much more into metal, but I had always like early zao. I heard this band on a music channel on cable, then proceeded to check them out. When I heard they had Shawn Jonas, formerly of zao, I decided it had to be good and bought the cd. Its rare (very rare) that I buy a cd without hearing the band and actually like it, but this one shocked me. It is as good as hardcore gets, in my opinion, an unrelenting album that doesn't let up but manages to keep my interest at the same time, which is unusual with hardcore. So why only four stars? Although they are probably the best hardcore around (aside from maybe Dillinger Escape Plan or Candiria) they are still hardcore...to earn 5 stars an album needs a bit more creativity and to break the molds a bit more. Don't be mislead though, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes hard/heavy music. Trust me on this and buy the album - its worth your money."
5,The best book on Korea by a westerner,"The book appears dated but it explores Korean culture before the economic boom and shows how Koreans as individuals live. The historical tracks are provided as well. There are many books on modern Korea, but this is a must have to any collection and a must have for anyone traveling to Korea for an extended time. This is a great book on the real Korea and its poeple and history."
2,dull dull dull,"I gave a scathing review for Takashi Miike's dreadful ""Happiness of the Katakuris"". Not good. It turns out that it was a remake of a Korean film, namely ""The Quiet Family"". While much better than the remake, the film still struggles under the weight of trying too hard to make the black humor strike home, although several moments are quite well done and elicited a minor chuckle. The basic story is a family who opens a lodge on a hiking trail and their guest keep accidentally dying off so rather than have it reflect badly on their lodge, they start hiding the bodies. THe main problem here is that its just not that funny and not at all scary which a horror/comedy should have at least one of those qualities. It left me, quite frankly, bored."
1,HELP,"Omg,I can't get this out of my hair,I washed it 10 times and with washing up liquid and still it won't come out.I'm so annoyed! How can this be good? X"
1,Not What I Expected,"I purchased the Mane 'n Tail Herbal Gro Maximum thinking it would be deep-conditioning and enriching, leaving my hair fortified, soft and luscious, but I was in for a surprise.Because the main ingredient is petroleum instead of conditioning oils, it left my hair greasy and unmanageable. Maybe it works for horses hair (if you need some grease to make things stick) but I wouldn't recommend it for people's hair to make it grow. No siree."
1,You might as well buy Vaseline.,"i was reallllly hopeful about this product- but seriously, it has the consistency of petroleum jelly!ewwwwww............i followed the directions exactly- but my hair was so greasy and sticky i seriously had to wash it out with dish soap. :(((((i am not exaggerating- this has the texture of Crisco shortening."
1,:(,I did not get this item !!!!I spend around one month to wait my order for this creme and.....nothing.....
3,"Informative, but dense","There is a lot of useful information in this book, but if you're looking to glean the essence of COM and ActiveX, and quickly learn how to code ActiveX components, this is not the book for you. If you're interested in the nitty gritty details underlying this technology, you'll find it here."
2,"Smart man, bad book","Yes, Appleman, you are smart and know the innards of vb like no one else. But a true manual makes complicated things easier to understand. In some cases, like the section on collections, this is achieved. Other chapters are so boring and buried in trivia that my head began to hurt, then I realized...I can close the book! I have a large library of vb books, and virtually never get the answers I need from this one."
2,Disappointing book,"The book covers ActiveX/COM but in a very wordy fashion. Pages and pages of irrelevant text make finding the core issues difficult. Some of the topic examples are reasonably useful, others are extremely trite. Surely Appleman can come up with better scenarios than rabbits in hutches.I bought this book to help take me beyond what is available in the Microsoft VB documentation, but it does not do so in any useful way. Having already splashed out the money on the book, I would prefer if advertising was kept in one section, rather than having it throughout the book (loads of code segments, no matter how trivial, are prefaced with a Desaware copyright notice, and we are continually told of their software products).This book has lots of body but not enough meat."
5,Excellent Intro to COM,"I read Dan Appleman's COM/ActiveX book, but I focused mainly on the Code Components portion. But by itself, I really got to know how to create classes and objects without having to go back to reading the book again and again because everything was thoroughly explained. It's definitely for everyone who wants to know COM."
1,Good book for someone who only likes to read,I buy most programming books with the expectation that there will be some step by step modules geared toward developing some type of application. I found nothing of the sort in this book. I found a lot of code to demonstrate what the author was saying. I felt the whole book - was geared toward the history and explanation of what various programming components were all about. I am an accomplished ASP Web/Database Developer and was interested in learning how to write activex components. I thank the author for wasting my money!
3,A Cheezy Spring board for Hocking Dasaware Products,"A good solid understanding of com may be achieved here. What about creating active X controls? I have a great understanding of how to create AXC's, but I bought the book to round my knowledge out. The topics I lack he either mentioned then flaked out on, Stating it is difficult to do, or he does through a desaware dll, or he refers to his API book.(I found the answers through trail and error) It is a shame he has the definitive book on the market about the subject. When I complete my knowledge quest, I'll amend that."
1,More Confused than when I Started,"The book is detailed and the guy obviously knows what he is talking about but that is little help for someone who is trying to understand the concept's and practicality of what is being put forward. Save your money and buy ""Visual Basic 6 Business Objects"" by WROX."
1,Almost fell asleep....,"I am about half way through this book, and I must say that the author certainly has a knack for boring the reader beyond belief. His personal feelings on features that were not implemented in VB 6 should not be in the book. He even asks the reader to send Microsoft email, so they will implement a feature he wants in one of the earlier chapter. The full source code has to be taken off the CD-ROM as the book usually does not show it all making it hard to follow. All in all this one is a real sleeper."
3,Too wordy,"This book is too wordy. It seems that the author just likes to talk...it takes som much book space to cover a certain point.Because it is wordy, it is hard to learn and harder to find info quickly.Because it is wordy, it does not have room for code (more precisely, it has...but not enough to understand; need look the code on CD to understant the example)."
5,Nantucket chair set,"this is my second set of Nantucket table and chairs. Over 5 years ago I bought a set for my triplet great granddaughters. They had so much use and abuse and they finally outgrew them. Their parents and those of us who were involved in their care loved them. They ate their meals at the set, colored, played with crafts and Pla Doh. This recent set was purchased because that one was terrific. This one is for a very clever physically active 3 year old. His dad put it together this week and he loves it. He told his mom he was fixing her a fancy meal!! He likes to help cook. When we have our Thanksgiving dinner, those triplets and he will share the table!! I expect he will be doing his crafts on it as well.Love the product, I thought the price was terrific and the shipping was perfect."
5,Great set!,We gave this set as a gift for a two year old and him and his parents love it and use it everyday! Colors are true to the picture and the quality is very good.
5,GREAT product!,"My 14 year old and I put this set together. We found it very easy to assemble. Its very sturdy, very pretty and my kids love this table. We bought it for an activity table, home work and such, but so far its been a snack table. After we move it once the holidays finish up it will get the use its intended for. Anyway, we saw some mixed reviews which made me a little nervous, but I am VERY happy with my purchase. Its really a lovely set and well worth the $99 we spent. I would recommend this table for sure!"
1,Chairs are horrible,Our first children's table and chair set was very simple one similar to the one ikea sells. It lasted 10 years under heavy abuse from 4 children. This table has lasted barely 2 years under far less abuse from my twins.The chair backs splinter and break under little to no strain. I threw 2 out within the first few months of buying. The blue one needs to go now. What good is this table without chairs!Definitely don't buy.
2,Fragile Chairs,The rubber bottoms of the table came ripped and broken. Not good for the floor. I am sick of talking to people about this.
3,table set,This is a very nice set. The table isn't as sturdy as the chairs and it arrived with a big scratch across the top. So we were sad. Our 2yr old granddaughter sat there and had her snack. She will love it.
2,No Nudity,This was a racing car DVD. I expected more girls with little clothes on. I was disappointed and scrapped the DVD
5,An absorbing book for our time,"""Under the Sun by Arthur Dorros is about war-torn Bosnia and a young boy's struggle with the ethnic hatred that has turned his world upside down. It is an insightful look into the heart of the young protagonist who finds hope and healing in unexpected places.I was gripped by the drama of the story and absorbed by the opportunity to view the Balkan wars from the perspective of a child experiencing the pain, confusion, and grief of that tragic time. ""Under the Sun"" is a beautifully written novel that gives me hope, even as I struggle to understand the new war that is being fought today."
4,Learn How things have Changed,"I bought this book, believe it or not, as a research volume. It clarifies the morals and mores of Roman society and makes them understandable. While they didn't have the same societal restrictions that we do, they were not complete hedonists either. I think the book presents a balanced presentation of life as it was lived in Roman times."
4,Plan City is fun but not durable,"These trees and the plan city toys in general are good fun - my son loves them - but we are constantly gluing them back together. The tree tops come off, and have to be re-glued to the bases. The trucks have broken into pieces and we re-glue those. They re-glue together fine, but we get tired of constantly repairing them. My son loves them though."
5,it's tanith lee. of course it's good. duh,"it's short, sweet, to the point. i won't get into the plot. i'm sure someone else has done that in a review, and it's not what i'm up to. if you like good books, buy it. if you have never read a book by tanith lee, buy any of her books, they are all good. and this one is no exception. she is the best."
4,"Beautiful, enchanting, and dark","The thing that keeps me coming back to Tanith Lee's writing, again and again, is the beautiful fairy-tale prose she expertly uses to weave her story. And this story does read like a fairytale, although a dark, morbid one. The story hooked me immediately and carried me along, despite the amoral nature of the protagonist and her strangely beautiful malevolence.Although Lee's prose is beautiful, formal, and elegant, it is not stiff. She describes effortlessly the nature and personalities of the widely varying characters, and illustrates emotion readily. The sheer loveliness of the descriptions of Louisa herself, of the clothes she wears, the setting into which she is placed, the workings of her mind, very much enchanted me.This was very much a pleasure to read, and I think I'll go shop for more of Lee's work now. I just can't get enough of her writing."
3,Same great taste... how old are they?,The flavors are great! They are exactly as I remember them... however... I also remember them being much softer and if you held an airhead vertical it would bend on it's own. I received the box just yesterday (in shrink wrap) and the candy was hard and could barely bite into them. I'm still in search of an expiration date on the box. With any food you order online you definately take a chance... some good and some bad... I'd rate this as a 3 for same great flavors and packaging but freshness... I gotta take 2 stars away.
2,Little stale,"Love Air Heads and was excited to find a 90ct box for so cheap. I guess the reason they were so cheap was because they were a little old. I'd say about 70% of the candies in the box were hard. It's not that big of a deal but if you like your Air Heads soft you probably won't be very happy with these.Who knows though, maybe I just got a bad batch."
2,I LOVE AIRHEADS NOT THIS SELLER,"First off I would like to say that I thought long and hard about buying this. I read other reviews claiming these were ""stale"" and ""not stored well"" and I would like to say this is 100% correct. You might not notice it very much, but it is correct. The airheads are not gooey and chewy like they should be. I got several hard lumps of something in many of them. There was no green apple flavor, only mystery, watermelon, blue raspberry, cherry, orange and pink lemonade. The orange and cherry had the most problem with deformation (melted and then hardened into different forms).The flaws with these airheads are subtle and will only apparent to an airhead connoisseur. If you don't mind these very subtle flaws and love airheads, buy this! But if you want fresh delicious airheads buy them elsewhere."
3,"Good, but let down","The product arrived quickly and was fresh, but one of the reasons I purchased this large pack was because it looked as if it had both orange and strawberry flavors inside the box. Instead, of strawberry there was pink lemonade, which made me really sad. Would have given it 5 stars if there were strawberry airheads inside."
5,A little bent candy ain't nothing to cry over.,"First and foremost: My only gripe with this product is that no matter which seller you buy from, the storage they use leaves some of your airheads in a shape that is unrecognizable. Still candy, but still unrecognizable.However, I always get all 90 airheads and even numbers of all flavors, which I like. These are wonderful and, now that I think about it, can be used by a wise little entrepreneur if they so chose."
5,great treat!,"I bought these for the last day of school last year for ""my"" kids (6,7 and 8th graders) and they totally loved them! The blue raspberry and mystery flavors were the most popular, so probably this year I will buy a box of each of those if possible. The texture is different than I remember as a kid though, but makes for a cheap, fun treat!"
2,Stale.... possible storage issue in their warehouse?,"This product was ordered for a friends's kids, and I tried it just to see what it was like. The product was stale - even the kids noticed without my saying anything. However, it would have been more trouble to send it back, so they kept it. It seems as if it may not have been stored properly - they appeared to be melted and then re-hardened to the shape of the foil wrapper.Won't order this product (or anything similar) online again."
4,air heads,Young adults love taking them out of the box and eating them. Loved the suprise one in white each one is different.L.A. Krupp Tiffin Ohio
5,"like Sonic Youth, Pavement, and Modest Mouse? Get this!","Out of the 3 most available full albums, this one is the best. One Kozzee Heart, they even give a shoutout to Steve Malkmus, claiming the song was inspired by hime. It's great, listen to the song samples. It sounds like ""S&E"" era Pavement, crossed with the upbeat tracks on Daydream nation (teenage Riot)."
3,Refrence,"Good reference material, but incomplete. I collect TWA first flights and I am always looking for reference material to collaborate the reference given in the AAMC"
5,Obsession,"Excellently crafted! The characters in ""Revenge"" are so believably written, you NEED to know what happens next. I wanted to follow them past their appearance in this book, even though the book ends at the perfect spot.A book you can't put down, and one you'll think about long after you've finished. I think it would make a good choice for a book discussion group."
5,"A highly suspenseful, beautifully written novel.","I picked up Revenge on a day when I felt I barely had time to brush my teeth and ended up staying up late to finish this compelling novel. The heroine, an artist named Andrea, is immediately sympathetic and as I turned the pages I became increasingly absorbed in her struggles to come to terms with her father's death and with her own precarious situation, teaching at a small college. When she becomes friends with her neighbour, a famous writer, I hoped for the best and feared the worst. Neither quite come true and that, for me, is one of the most impressive feats of this elegant book. I never knew what was going to happen next but whatever did happen seemed both surprising and just right. Highly recommended."
2,Dancer from LA,"I really did not like this CD at all. Don't buy this CD if you are a beginning Belly Dancer. Very hard to dance to unless you are an advanced dancer. The drum beat in the first two songs was so abnoxious it nearly gave me a headache. I bought it, put it in my player and listened to the six songs hoping to find at least one that was enjoyable but didn't. Took it out and put it up for sale. There are a lot better CD's out there for the money, and with more than 6 songs on it."
2,Music,I was a bit disappointed with this one. I was hoping for some good music for new choreo's and this was just not my style. For someone else it might be okay - just not for me.
3,Good book for beginners,"Compared to other books in this field, this one is lacking for the avid collecter. It is a very good book for the beginner because it covers the most common types of points pretty well. The pictures and discriptions are as good as most in this field."
1,Don't Touch it with a Ten Foot Pole,"I give it 1 star because that's the lowest rating available.I don't have the DVD, I have a video. The box shows a T Rex on the front so I knew it was going to be a good one! WRONG! As pointed out by another reviewer, the cruelest trick of all cheap dinosaur movies is played upon the viewer: There's no dinosaur! Only an overgrown lizzard.I like cheap dinosaur movies, and I like watching them with my nephew. Even HE felt ripped off by the ""dinosaur."""
5,sizzling,i think sizzla is the best reggae artist because he speaks the truth in all his lyrics firebun pope paul firebun babylon firebun all false preachers and all hethens JAH RASTAFARI LIVETH FOR IVER
4,Great for all furmommies and furdaddies,"Very cute DVD and arrived in good packing - even tho Amazon sent it to me too slow:-((But I finally was able to give this gift to a Birthday friend - who also is ""addicted"":-)) to furbabbies - like I am.:-))"
5,Absolutely loved it...,"I randomly stumbled on this on Netflix, and boy am I happy! This is an amazing documentary of how people met their dogs and how their dogs affect their lives. The background music goes extremely well with everything, which makes the movie 10 times better.Also, is it just me or did anyone else cry during the adopting and dying segments?"
1,It's not difficult to provide an accurate description,They should provide the photo for the white one so people actually know what it looks like. This is the black one (Krusell 00332)
2,Buyers Beware!,"I was enthusiastic about subscribing to Arts & Crafts Homes magazine, as well as another home magazine (Old House Journal) at a reduced price through Amazon. It is clear to me at this point, however, that these prices are a device to get rid of back issues. Both magazines have filled half of my one year subscription with an initial mailing of back issues. I am NOT happy! I would have liked to have known what I was actually buying before purchasing these subscriptions."
1,DO NOT ORDER,See reviews by Moonheart & Rasmussen. This magazine company sent me 4 issues at same time in orer to fulfill one year subscription. Back issues were sent by company. I have many mag subs thru Amazon & all handled smoothly. Arts & Crafts Homes operates in fraudalent manner. DO NOT ORDER SUBSCRIPTION W/ THIS MAG.
2,Arts & Crafts Homes Magazine,"Just got my first copy, was fairly disappointed due to the large amount of advertising and small amount of content about Homes. What was pictured was beautiful. I will give it another chance but at this point would not recommend it for someone like myself who is looking for practical ideas to bring their home into the Arts and Craft style."
1,5 weeks later ...... not yet received!,I ordered the subscription on August 7th and nothing has been received!...it's now September 19th! What more need I say?!
1,:o(,"I was very disappointed in this product. I expected much more than it gave. I love to craft, but this just wasn't what I expected, and I did not enjoy it at all."
2,Have not recieved my first issue yet,I have not received my first issue yet. Hope it will be worth the wait.
5,CDB Supports the Troops - Live!,"After kicking off the show with the Pledge of Allegiance, the Charlie Daniels Band fires up the troops in Iraq with a selection of their greatest hits and a couple of new numbers. You can feel how electric these shows must have been for both the CDB and the brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces.The set list is an essential collection of CDB hits, although, now that Charlie is older and wiser - at 70 - a few lyrics have been changed to some of the older songs that once referenced drug use. The new music includes ""Iraq Blues,"" about the brave Soldiers over there, and ""Floreeda Road,"" an instrumental piece showcasing the talents of each member of the band. Easily ranks up there with the best live albums I've ever heard.Other great live albums:The Hits LiveDouble Live"
1,"Not what I ordered, returning item for refund",These are not the PIAA Extreme white bulbs as stated!!! Do not waste your money!!! These do not even look anything like the PIAA's. They are clear bulbs with no blue tint at all. I am returning for a refund.
2,Piaa H3 Bulb,The bulb is clear not a blue like the picture shows. The bulb is nice other than their is no blue to it. But after running it for about 2 hours it became bluish tint to the light it produced. I thank they are better than silver star bulbs cost's less.
5,Settlers of Catan Replacement Cards,This is such a fun game. We play it so much that we have dog-eared our deck of cards that come with the game. I shopped for the best price but always come back to Amazon.
5,settlers cards,We love the Settlers game and wear the cards out so nice to have an extra set on hand. Thanks
4,"Expensive, but a great game that is new each time played.",A strategy game where the play in last place can still win. Strategies change with every game as the board layout changes. Only down side is the puzzle like assembly. Wears out fast.
2,Draining,"This MP3 player has a lot of things going for it, but the time I get out of batteries is ridiculous. I literally go through 1 battery every 2 days."
2,Avoid It,"It'll seem nice, in the beginning, but it will easily break on you after a month or two. It has a ton of bugs and glitches in it and the hardware and wiring inside it is really shoddy. You should avoid most any products made by Coby, altogether. They are one of the cheapest electronics companies in the world. EVERYTHING they make, from Mp3 players and earphones, to televisions, breaks almost right away."
2,good and bad,"These really are nearly indestructible, that is the good. The bad is that that makes them stronger than anything else on the helicopter so expect to do even harder to replace random destruction during a crash, such as chopping off the tail boom with these heavy and tough blades. (Yes, that is the voice of experience speaking)"
1,NOT Jack White from the White Stripes,"Just a warning for anyone as confused as us. This is NOT the guy from the White Stripes. It may well be a great CD, we returned it unopened as it appears to be Christian folk. Not that there's anything wrong with that, just not our thing."
2,Hardly a hotel......,"When I read this I thought It was really un-realstic andboring. I like all Animal ark books and I have got them all includingthe Wildlife ways collection. I was surprised that Lucy Daniels wrote this. Okay in places,boring in most"
2,Fair. Video Movie Guide much better.,"I have both Video Movie Guide 2001 and Leonard Maltin's book. They for the most part give the same rating, but Video Movie Guide is more informative and I agree with their thoughts on the movies better than Mr. Maltin. If you want a good movie book (and a cheaper one) get Video Movie Guide 2001."
2,Leonard Maltin!!!!,"OK. Now, if you're looking for a book to really help you decide what to watch tonight, this is NOT the one. I think that if someone were to follow this guy, and never watch a movie he gave a bad rating, well, they'd never ever see a movie in their whole life. Seriously, this man hates everything!!!!! And, I noticed he's also a cheat. You see, I love Gremlins, and had watched it many times, but had never watched the second one, Gremlins 2 The New Batch. Then, I read Maltin's review of Gremlins. TWO STARS!!!! Yuck! But, then I saw that he gave the second film three stars, and so I decided to rent it. I did. I did not like it. And I noticed that Leonard Maltin himself has a cameo in this movie! I think the producers and directors said ""Hey, Mr. Maltin, if we let you be in our movie, will you give it a good rating?"" And he said ""Oh, sure"". So, there you have it."
2,print,The print is too small. One needs a magnifying glass. An edition with larger print is urgently needed
2,Just an OK book,"After reading ""Places By The Sea"" I was very disappoined in this book. It's an easy read, but was too prdictable. Also I felt it was loosely based on the Kennedy's life. It is not one I will keep to re-read as I have with ""Places By The Sea"". However I will try more books by Jean Stone."
4,A great read for a snowy night by the fire!,"This is the first time I've read Jean Stone. I was drawn to the book because it is set in Martha's Vineyard, where I've vacationed at my brother's home. This book grabbed me right from the beginning, and held me captive until the end. I loved the ironic twists of the characters that shaped the main character's youth and how they came together into her adult years. I kept wanting to pick it up and read when I should have been doing other things!"
3,Summer reading,Good storyline. Good twists and turns and I didn't want to put it down. I will definitely read another book by this author.
4,Light Summer Read,"I agree with another reviewer who said this was very Kennedyesque, but I enjoyed it on it's own merits. Light summer read."
5,Absolutly incredible video,"If you love Queensryche, you will love this video. Operation Mindcrime live is just the best live video you could find ever. I bought it many years ago, and I still haven't seen anything else better. The concept of Operation Mindcrime gets all its meaning in this video. I really hope that the editors will release it on DVD one day"
3,BUY THE CD INSTEAD,"The music on this video is good, but my favourite tracks THE NEEDLE LIES and SPREADING THE DISEASE aren't included. This is basically just the band miming performance-style to tracks from the album with footage linking the concept material. The fact that the ""performance"" is obviously choreographed makes it slightly cheesy. You're better off giving this a miss and buying the CD instead. The special ""bonus"" track is just another ""performance"" of I DON'T BELIEVE IN LOVE."
2,ripped apart in ten minutes,My large dog ripped this apart in ten minutes - which is an improvement over the average 2 minutes for his destruction of toys - which is why I gave it two stars. He still plays with the piece of cloth that is left.
5,Excellent read on a difficult subject,"I thought the authors did an excellent job of presenting their research in a manner that made for an entertaining, yet enlightening, read. Most of the information they presented wasn't new, but they presented it in such a way so that you didn't have to be a scholar to understand it. Their major thesis makes much more sense than the Patriarchs, Exodus, trumpets and walls described in the bible. Archeology may eventually come up with different scenarios than what the authors described, but those scenarios will be based on science and not trying to justify theologically based works."
2,A very focused book,"This is a good book showing why historically and through archaeology, a late date for the Exodus (anywhere from the 14th to 11th centuries BCE) would be impossible. Unfortunately, the authors do not even consider an earlier date for the Exodus.For a more balanced look at all the possibilities, and a more equitable treatment of a wider range of archaeological finds, check first with William Stiebing's book, ""Out Of The Desert?"" Although this book is over ten years old, the information is still current.Even though Stiebing himself is of the opinion the Exodus did not happen, a careful study of the archaeological finds presented shows the Exodus could have happened in the 15th century BCE, exactly where the Bible places it...."
3,Read Carefully,"The authors who wrote this book are well known scholars who are highly respected in their field. I'm obligated to point out, however, that their conclusions are far from the only ones which are out there. The authors take a minimalist perspective in analyzing the bible, and as a result their bias towards the side of skepticism shows. I read this book and enjoyed it greatly, but it's not the only book you should read. Read some of the works by writers who tend to believe more in the historicity of the bible as well to balance this book and to get a more balanced picture. I was tempted to rate this book higher because of its clarity and quality, but one has to look out for biases."
1,Premise Has Been Thoroughly Discredited,"The major premise of this book, which seeks to redate the united monarchy period, has been thoroughly discredited. However, don't just take my word for it. Before wasting your money and time reading this entire book, see the review by Nicolae Roddy of Creighton University. Finkelstein's revisionism is not accepted by most archaeologists. In fact, he has been debunked by many respected archaeologists working in Palestine, including Eliat and Amihai Mazar, Amnon Ben-Tor, Doron Ben-Ami, and Jane Cahill. Whatever the authors' motives, this is another failed attempt to write off much of the Old Testament as non-historical."
1,NO PROOFS,The authors suceeded into raising questions-but thats all- the haven't succeeded into disproving the bible.
1,JUST ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO DISPROVE THE BIBLE,"The authors have twisted biblical archeology to question or deny many aspects of the Hebrew Scriptures. The book's contents are given away by the front jacket summary: The authors explain ""how and why the Bible's historical saga differs so dramatically from the archeological finds. They explain what the Bible says about ancient Israel and show how it (the Bible) diverges sharply from archeological reality.""This is nothing more than two ""experts"" trying to show that the Bible is not God's inspired Word. NOT WORTH WASTING TIME READING!RUSS MINER"
3,"interesting material, not optimally presented","The material is fascintaing but neither optimally organised nor presented. The syntax is often convoluted and laborious. I would have had an easier time had I been more familiar with the Old Testament, but that is my fault, not the author's. Since there are many references to local geography, more maps, or at least a map index would have been helpful. I recomment it be read with a Bible nearby, a historical map on the wall, and an open mind."
4,Kindle needs editing,"This book is an amazing overview of the state of modern Biblical Archeology. There is one problem with the Kindle eddition, however-quite often spaces are missing which makes words run together."
2,Poor scan Technique,The scan is so poor on this ebook that it is just about unreadable on the kindle screen. It is slightly better on the Kindle for PC system. But then what is the purpose of a kindle if no portabilit and READABILATY?
5,Eye Opening,"The book is aimed at looking for archaeological evidence to the stories told in the bible. The conclusions that the authors reach are sometimes controversial due to lack of archaeological evidence to support such stories. One can still claim that even though evidence is not found to support certain stories, there is no conclusive assuranec that those events never took place (even though the authors offer findings that contradict certain biblical claims). However, the authors' perspective is based on scientific findings that are certainly eye opening. Due to the challenge of finding conclusive evidence when researching antiquity, much of the authors' findings cannot be viewed as facts, rather, are open for interpretation by the reader. The authors also offer different opinions of other historians and archaeologists, which strengthens the notion that much of the distant past is quite unclear and open for interpretation."
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"I JUST received lamp #3 and not only is a piece broken but it doesn't work AT ALL when plugged. Granted, I ordered it the first time from another company. But this is the 2nd lamp from Price Pros and it is still defective. KNG America is producing some shoddy work. Do not buy this lamp. It is not worth the time and effort to get it and send it back. Now I have two broken lamps to send back."
4,A harley Cave Must,This is a great lamp provides ample light the only thing bad is it does have a circuit board in the bottom with a tiny little fuse once the fuse blows the lamp wont work. We had only used ours a short while so we opened it up put a small peice of aluminum foil in it. yes i know thats dangerous but we love the lamp :)
2,Arty the Smarty,Was not like the picture. It was in VERY rough shape. The binding was completely gone. Lots of pages ripped.
3,Y'SHUA,"The book was not what I expected. I already knew most of what info it contained. I was looking for a deeper meaning behind the name of our Lord Jesus. The seller was excellent, shipping great, fair price. I wish the book had been as good as the seller.AJ"
3,Good starter bike,"We got this for my son's third birthday last winter, and it was a pretty good starter bike. It retailed at about fifty but I got it on sale.Definitely not worth more than this. We had no issues with the pedals, but by the end of summer, having seen plenty of action (borderline abuse), with my son speeding round and round our driveway, one of the training wheels bent, then broke. We got replacements, but they don't fit well ( too big). I found it hard to find training wheels to fit 12 inch wheels."
2,You must not have much to spend your money on,"If you like this you've eaten too much LSD too. I suppose if you've really conditioned yourself to like this kind of music you could get off on this, but it's no ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" Stay away from this."
3,"Good music, semi-annoying vocals...",I love the music of this cd but sometimes I can't help but find the lead singers vocals a little annoying. Her voice kind of throws the music off the path of righteousness that it could have possibly gone on. The vocals aren't very good and remind me a lot of a weak Debbie Gibson. The songs are great though and for the production and overall sound I have to give this album 3 stars. With a different vocalist I would have given this 4 or 5 stars but there are just too many moments while listening to this cd that I want to just strangle the singer.
4,very good & a touch of unique,"i like this cd alot. this is a cd that you need to lock yourself away and put it on and listen to the whole cd. when i first got it, i skimmed through each track and thought ""this is a little different"". i decided that night to play some solitare on my pc. i put it on and listen to the entire cd. i loved it. great vocals. i got the feeling it had a touch of Mila Mar type of vocals in a few tracks. the cd is 68:32 long so you get a nice length. some of the songs are a slower more deep songs, while others have a nice dance feel to them. the song ""try to relate"" could end up on radio i think. the song ""some girl"" is already a single, and a great choice for one too. nice and dancey. the kind of exotic whisper/singing in parts of it is a very nice toucha good cd to add to your collection. and of course another great cd from the shelves of a different drum. :-))"
1,Poor copy of original,"The current belt is cheaply colored leather with poor tooling. and Mexico proudly stamped on it. I have one from 15 years ago that is still going strong, but I needed a smaller size. So I ordered this belt, and it is such a disappointment. The tooling is barely pressed in with little definition compared to the original even after 15 years of wear. The edges are not crisp, and the cuts are not sharp. The color is not the original medium tan. instead it is the light tan of very cheap leather goods. The buckle is also 2/3 the size of the original."
3,cheap leather,"Belt looks nice but leather is definitely not top grade. I don,t expect the belt to stand up well with extended wear."
5,His best CD yet! LaMotte really shows his depth and variety.,"A wonderful experience for anyone who has ever loved the mountains (and acoustic/folksy music). LaMotte's range in both content and style is truly impressive, making ""Hard Earned Smile"" his most mature and touching work to date. ""Butler Street"" is amazing for it's sincerity, while ""Stupid in Love"" will make you want to grab a partner and boogy! There is truly something for every acoustic guitar lover on this CD."
2,not worth it,"I got this book as I myself have had ""anomalous"" experiences. However, this author does not appear to be using critical thinking when reporting what her aliens? are saying. Real knowledge can be logically demonstrated or is congruent with our everyday experiences. this seems to be more cult like ""New Agey"" I would not recomend this particular book. If one is interested in this I would recomend Jim Spark's ""Te Keepers"" or a host of other books. Bear in mind that no one on this planet has the whole picture and unavoidably distorts what they've seen/experienced."
2,just an era,"I liked the movie for the music and the costumes, I thought they were all great and nick stahl looked handsome as ever. As to the steaming pot and to answer some of the other reviewers answers about it. I think it had something to do with the cleansing of the well you know..........also it has been know to make the inside of a women.......hotter than normal temperature. I hope this helps any. I read a few historical novels and I had run across something like that."
2,confusing movie,"This movie was confusing...It's also hardly believable that grown men would sit around for hours playing kiddie games and squabbling like nursery school children over who got to ""kiss her hand."" Especially considering how concieted, rude and bossy she was.The ""peasant plot"" ended abruptly in the middle of the movie, and was poorly done all along. Denis seemed unconvincing as a man in love, he seemed like a sneak, always spying on this woman. I swear I thought he was going to murder her when he was lurking around in the shadows. When he proclaims his love for her nobody cares, because we hardly know either one of them nor saw them interact previously. We never knew what happened to the woman, her poor husband, and Denis. Does the heartbroken husband leave? Does Denis kill him? Does the woman run away and leave them to duke it out? Who knows.Sometimes the dialouge seems too modern and out of place for a period piece.The ending is also horribly disturbing, ..."
1,Piece of crap,"I really didn't understand this movie. It was so disconnected and just........strange! I found myself in a state of total disgust after viewing it and I'm wondering what Kirsten Dunst was thinking when she took on the role. And also- what did Zinaida die of?? And what happened when Nick Stahl was in the tree and saw her through the window? Zinaida was doing something with her dress... And what in the he[ck] happened to the serfs????? They just dissapeared! Maybe I just wasn't watching closely enough, so if anyone could explain these things to me, that'd be great. Anyways, to the person reading this who's actually thinking about buying the movie, let this be a warning. Please, don't waste your money on this piece of .... It's horrible."
5,Summertime Dream,Gordon Lightfoot has been one of my favorite artists for many years. I wanted to add this to my collection and was not disappointed. His voice and music are understandable and not noisy as the new artists seem to be.
4,Lightfoot's best album,"This album is worth the money for just The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, in my opinion. However, the rest of the album is not to be underestimated. It's a great easy-going album which doesn't have any offensive tunes on it. This is a great background music album to play for a group of friends to sit around and enjoy some good conversation and wine!"
5,great music,"Fans of folk music as well as Rock and Roll will enjoy this. I purchased this CD for ""Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"", but enjoy the entire cd! It's the kind that you can put on in the background and listen to the entire cd without having to skip tracks or change the cd after 2 songs."
4,Buy Summertime Dream for Keeps,"I purchased this CD to have one of my favorite songs ""The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald"" available to listen to on que. I learned that most of the songs on this CD qualify under the ""need to listen to on que"" status. There's a different mood to every song. However, what is common to these songs is that they can run through your head without notice. This is a CD that will grow on you...case in point...I had this CD not more than one month and I played it 4 times through on a trip from Miami to Key West and back. If you like ""The Wreck of the Edmind Fitzgerald"", do yourself a big favor and buy this CD."
5,One of my favorite Lightfoot albums I have on CD!,"Summertime Dream released in 1976 has one of my favorite song that's the true original on their called ""The Wreck of The Edmund Fitzgerald"" about that great historical sinking ship that went down on lake superior. This one is a great album I hope theirs another Gordon Lightfoot album CD that I could or might get which has the tune ""Black Day In July"" on it!"
4,Pretty Decent Album - Forget the Drums though,"I really like this album but I think Gordon is guilty of underproducing and trying to implement drums in every song. You can barely hear the drums in the songs that they're in. The drum patterns are awful, weak, and too quiet. I think that an album like this, which is commanded by strong acoustic guitar patterns, should just stay in that format and forget about the drums all together. Others that could have benefited from this idea is CSN, Neil Young, The Eagles, and Elton John. Otherwise, a great album throughout. I love Too many Clues in this room and I'm not supposed to care. Lightfoot is a very sincere vocalist and a great acoustic guitar player."
2,What Was He Dreaming About?,"I have been a fan of Gord since EDMOND FITZGERALD was played all over the radio in '76 or '77. At the time either I was not aware of all this other stuff on the album, or I didn't much care for it then. WOTEF is the only song of much account. It appears that the other songs show a change in his person, also a move towards the infamous commercialism that fills our current ""music"".Hey, everyone has a bad day, and SUMMERTIME DREAM was Gord's."
5,Epic sounds,Gordon Lightfoot has a great ear for music and words. His voice and vocal expressions really make an impact in music.
1,Gordo's falling apart here,"This is where the string of hits would end for Gordo as pretty much Disco would rule over the charts for the rest of the decade. This is a rather mournful way to end it as alot of these tunes are just so flat out depressing. They are also rahter forgettable except the title track, and his last big monster hit ""The Wreck Of The Edmund Fitzgerald"" which was actually based on the wreck of a boat the year before off the coast of Lake Michigan, and a noreaster came along, and blasted the ship to smithereens. To be honest if Gordo was out to make it sound depressing, and stark he accomplished his job well, but sorry Gordo!!!! If I want to hear about the Edmund Fitzgerald I'll stick with the show about it on either A&E, or was it History International, or was it Discovery? Help me out here, so I don't have to hear it from Gordo again."
5,The Best of Betty,"I've been reading this author forever. Between my sister, my mother and I, we own every Betty Neels ever put out by HQ and MB. And I've read all of them at least twice. Some of them far more than that.THE SECRET POOL is one of her best. It is certainly--hands down--the most emotional. Skip the tissue, go directly for the paper towel. But of course there's a happy ending. Hear, hear for Dutch professors and English nurses."
5,Fall of Troy = Manic goodness,"The Fall of Troy's third release, is right where I'd expect them to be: a little bit older, but they haven't lost the edge, and the music structure I guess represents what it's like to have ADD. I see this band, and this release as being not very accessible, perhaps because of its strange manic style. By manic I mean there are extreme moods being represented,and visceral energy. In a recent interview guitar/vox Tom Erak stated that when writing this album it was during a dark period for him, which is manifested in Manipulator. The guitar once again is awesome, the vocals alternate between clean singing, to shrieks, screams, and some growls. You could hardly call these songs boring, even if it's not as intense as their first and second (more similar to the latter). Some of the songs are even catchy, in their own strange way.If you like/dislike let me know"
4,"Bizarre, Attention-Deficit Prog/Punk/Rock/Noise?!","The Fall Of Troy are an interesting new band, combining elements of some recent musical trends into....something. Metal, psychedelia, world music, punk and rock all get stirred together in this impatient, wildly fast-moving brew. Sort of like what would happen if you combined At The Drive In, Underoath, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Rush, and Clutch. So, of course, they are virtually indefinable.Comparisons to The Mars Volta are unavoidable; they play the same style of ""outside the box"" avant-garde weirdness, and the vocals literally sound just like Volta alum Cedric Bixler-Zavala; but Fall Of Troy guitarist/vocalist Thomas Erak has obviously been weaned on Sabbath and Metallica riffs, and this makes Troy's sonic blowout a bit heavier, which is refreshing for me. Interesting stuff, and pretty catchy sometimes, too. I will look forward to hearing more from this band. Not quite cohesive enough to earn more than 3.5 stars, though...."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"If you're looking for prog emo by all means look to these guys rather than Coheed And Cambria. Prog has never been known for catchy memorable melodies, and unlike Coheed's records you won't find many on this one, rather an amorphous glut of frequent erratic stops and starts, vocals that are completely indebted to New Found Glory and Glassjaw rather than bringing anything new to the table, and a muddy guitar tone that works against their playing style. Good complex songwriting should have a solid base and then add the experimental toppings but it seems like these guys can only do one or the other at a time. In those moments where they stand still long enough to lock into a groove it becomes apparent how conventional their compositional instincts are so I suppose it's just as well that they stick to the technical showboating and juvenile experimentalism."
2,ummm.......,"i thought i would give this band a try and ya know what; waiste of my download time. music in general; not too shabby at all. vocals/singer: my god, wtf? sounds like he is trying to hard. but the 2 stars go to the music. A. should become like explosions in the sky; just play music. or B. Get a new singer"
5,Phat Rockin' Guitars & Beats,"'Rehab' is from new UK electronica duo Manchild - tagged 'the new Prodigy' - with guest vocals from Andy Cairns of UK rock legends Therapy? It is a perfect match, with Cairns' powerful, angry hate complimented by Manchild's tough, uncompromising beats & guitars. The track has a very Prodigy/ Limp Bizkit feel to it & has high production values. It's the first thing I heard by Manchild & it's reflective of their awesome debut album 'Untied States'. A must have record."
5,Hill Harper is brilliant!,"I originally thought I would be somewhat disappointed in this movie, because of the movie title. However, I rented it because I am a fan of Hill Harper. I was wonderfully surprised! This is a great movie to watch. Hill Harper was outstanding as usual and so were the other actors. The storyline is good and entertaining right up to the very end. This movie is a must see and I do plan to purchase this movie for my personal movie library. Kudos to sexy Hill Harper and the rest of the cast!"
4,Love Sex And Eating Bones,I saw this movie that the Pan AFrican Movie Festival early this year at the Magic Johnson Theathre. I think younger adults as well as older adults in long term relationships will really enjoy this movie. Hill Harper is actor that doesn't stick to one type of acting genre so in this role he plays is very convincing. The movie points out that if you so caught up in looking at one thing it's hard to change the out look to something different. I hope alot of young adults buy this movie
4,Fits Buick 300 & 340,"This product fits perfectly on a 300. The 300 mount is discontinued but this 340 mount is stronger and interchangeable with the weaker 300 mount. Although under ""check your application"" it says that it won't fit, don't worry - it fits perfectly! Also, right and left are identical."
1,Piece of liberal trash,"Anti-flag sucsk, terrible music and even worse sterotypical liberlistic anti-government hypocracy that has plagued the punk rock scene. If you want good music, listen to The Offspring or Less Than Jake, something that has some melody or tune, and does not have stupid opinions."
4,Caster/Camber gauge,"Did what I needed it to do! No one wanted to align the front end of my 48 chevy car, so I bought this, used it, and the car drives great!"
5,Challenge,"Since I am a puzzle lover as is my friend (to whom this was sent) we found this puzzle not only challenging but very amusing to conquer..We have decided however, never to eat Kelloggs cereal again!"
2,Disappointing,Offers nothing new that study bible notes or a general bible commentary would not provide...Save your money and just purchase either a study bible or general commentary...
4,Could be better,"This LOTR AOME set is good but could be better. The detail on the horse and the 2 figures (removable from the horse) sport extreme detail but lack good poseability. Gimli can barely hold his axe. Other AOME sets have better poseability in their figures, so if you are looking for a good set to play with, pass on this one. If you are a completist, a displayer, or just a die-hard fan of Legolas and Gimli, I'd say, why not get it? It's okay but could be better."
4,legolas and gimli,this toy is great if you want to keep it on a shelf. the weapons are a bit delicate i know that because i broke gimlis axe. gimli is a bit hard to get on the horse. but you know stuborn dwarfs. this is a great minirature toy.
2,Is it horror or a thriller?,"It is a story of an ax murderer that escaped from death row. That is why it says Axe on the DVD cover. I guess that wasn't good enough when it was released in 2004, so they renamed it and brought it out again in 2006 as Greed, a story of greedy people after $300,000.POSSIBLE SPOILER: Everyone, and I do mean everyone, in the movie is after the money.This coulda been a contenda. I spent the entire movie watching Darlena Tejeiro. I was absolutely enchanted with this beauty. She was a rock climber, but the best mountains in the movie remained covered in clouds, and we never saw the peaks. What a shame! But, I do have to say that she was the best actor in the movie. That doesn't mean I will watch Starsky & Hutch to see her again, but she was good.The actual ax murders were pretty lame. This could have easily been a PG movie. More thriller than horror."
4,Axe-lent,"I was pleasently surprised with this action/horror film. The action was great and the girls were hot. I was always a fan of Jason London, and he did not disappoint me here.There are a lot of weird characters in the movie, and a few surprising twists.Goes well with pop corn and beer..."
2,Low budget and silly,"Two women ride across California on their motorcycles while being chased by a motorcycle gang and an escaped serial killer with an axe. The motorcycle gang don't ride harley's, they are on dirtbikes! LOL!! I kid you not. And the serial killer seems to be bullet proof for no apparent reason. Maybe he is a poor man's evil superman. What a joke."
1,REALLY?,Everyone gave this book a good review. I am not sure if we are reading the same book then because i thought it was a waste of time. I will agree this book can not be taken seriously. I feel the author has some real issues. the underlying anger and hate of mankind or people as a whole. I just loved the part of get your creative license by sending $9.00 to some place in Santa Fe NM (which by the way no longer exist). Oh and the back of the book about the offical Extraterrestrial census form. That too go to the same Santa Fe address. $13.00 for this was a waste of money had i bought it but it was a waste of time just reading it. Sad part is it was given to me to read by someone who does take it VERY seriously. I just pray she doesn't try to jump on a comets tail!!!
4,No Longer Out of Print,"It is good to see the Exam Cram series of books back on the market. I think the company switched hands or something and now you can get these great books again. I took the 218 exam early last year and passed using this exam cram book (1st Edition) along with the Microsoft Press book on the 218 exam. Before I went into the exam I studied the card insert of this book for about an hour and it was a great refresher. I passed the test and got my MCSA cert as well. Exam Cram gets you to concentrate on only the material covered in the exams and is a great tool for passing the test. However, if you want to learn about Windows 2000 networking and active directory paradigms I would suggest purchasing something else. Get the cert first though. Good luck."
4,"Everything is clear, Que rocks!!!","DeJuan, MCP-A+-Net+.What else is there to say. You buy this book and study, you learn and you pass the test. It's that simple. Yes I will say you do need to have some experience to understand about 2% of the material, but that's what study guides are for, not exam crams. Que has set the bar high."
5,fantastic,"Not only is this book a nice antique book to add to you collection, but it's very interesting to read. Full of history, information and images showcasing lettering alphabets and compositions."
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Gavanelli as Rigoletto was quite outstanding. I was disappointed by Alvarez. His singing was quite forced; it had no squillo at all. For a moment I thought I was watching a broadway play about a back alley gangster in the 50s. His voice failed to be seductive (questo o quella was very flat), and there was no charm. The quartet at Sparafucile's house was very mediocre. Monterone did not sound ominous enough. He is supposed to represent absolute morality; his voice is supposed to be that of God throwing thunderbolts down to earth.Gilda I found charming and naive enough to be credible.The nuditity failed to add anything artistic to the opera. True opera fans should not need it to appreciate the music. Thus, I'm not sure of the intention of the producers.Overall I think the Pavarotti version, with Edita Gruberova and Wixell has much better singing."
3,Uneven singing !,"This performance is a disappointment especaially I bought it because of rave review by other customers.Schafer's sing is uneven and she is not suitable for this coloratura role. I saw her in ""Lulu"" at the Met last year and she was great,maybe she should stick with more Germanic roles.Alvarez's singing is unimpressive and sometimes he is pushing his voice so much that the sound becomes unpleasant.Gavanelli is the best of all ( Well, that's why the opera is titled "" Rigoletto "" ).He sings with good tecnique and acts well too.He sounded very good life at the Met.The staging looks cheap and boring and I don't see the need for frontal nudity in the first act."
5,Goose Bumps and Tingling Toes.,"Ever since my first viewing of this band a year ago I've been a diehard fan awaiting an appearance in South Florida. In Blue is #1 on my heavy rotation list and I'm a heavy rock fan. I've introduced this cd to many people as it is ethereal and soul moving upon this first note and it has been immediately purchased. I give 5 stars to this cd and highly recommend it to anyone who is somebody for someone. Hat's off to the Corrs family, they have my highest and utmost respect as musicians who are on the verge of conquering the music world. They do leave me BREATHLESS! Check out the whole collection..........."
5,The 5 Star Rating is For the B-Sides,"The 2 B-sides on this single are 5 star brilliant. ""Head in the Air"" and ""Judy"" are everything a Corrs' songs should be--a wonderful melding of pop and traditional Irish influences. So, for those 2 songs you should buy the single.By contrast, ""Breathless"" is a dreadful song that deserves zero stars. The lyrics are horrid and the music is a synthentic mess. How this song became popular I'll never know."
3,Starts off well but deteriorates mid-way......,"The early chapters of this book deal with the founders and the contexts of founding of the Seven Sister Colleges (Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Mt. Holyoke, Radcliffe, Smith, Vassar, Wellesley). The anecdotes and actors make for fascinating social history. But after establishing the schools' early characters, Kendall seems to lose her sense of direction. The subsequent chapters are full of random observations and anecdotes that do not cohere to any particular perspective or point. Certain colleges get decidedly more coverage than others. As the subtitle suggests, the book is more gossipy than academic. But even a gossipy book ought to have *some* structure and some point. All in all, one gets the impression that this book was a good idea that was undermined by lack of material and lack of an outline."
2,Not very thrilling,"This was my first rollercoaster DVD purchase and I am terribly disappointed. I was expecting more ""front-seat"" coaster rides. I am afraid now to purchase other simular titles. I would prefer no sound other than actual effects of track noise and rider whoops, screams and yells."
1,Boring,"Buy one or all of the videos from the Thrill Rides box set instead of this selection. The video centers more on simulator attractions than ""regular"" thrill rides, which, in my opinion, isn't exciting unless your couch at home is moving violently like a simulator itself. You learn more about the science AND history of thrill rides in the previously noted video set as opposed to ""The Science of Fun."""
1,Fabulous Movie,"This is a fabulous IMAX movie about Motion Simulators. It would be of great interest to those who do 3D Computer Graphics programming, and looking for some great project idea for their course."
3,Not Enough Practice,"This book is helpful is you are already strong in math and only need to brush up on the basic details. All the ""strategies"" in this book are generic (like all the other Kaplan books) and THERE IS WAY TOO LITTLE practice problems. Every chapter begins and ends with a test of about 5-8 problems, and it only had two samples test of each kind (IC and IIC). I have not taken the test yet but I feel very insecure using this book, I will try the Barron's SAT II Math IIC after I work my way through this one; it seems to have received many positive reviews at Amazon.com."
2,The Woman's Prayer Companion - Buyer Be Aware,"Clearly The Woman's Prayer Companion needs a more descriptive write up. Some may find this in Breviary format with inclusive language and feminist bent their cup of tea...it simply was not mine and I was very disappointed. It's format is in a somewhat Breviary styled but the writing is certainly not up to Breviary standard and the language while inclusive seemed aimed at a less than mature reading audience.On the upside, it is a nicely bound paperback with a nice cover. I am sure the good Carmelite Sisters were well intentioned and for some this may well become a cherished volume."
2,Disapointed,"As a subscriber to Cooking Light, I was very disapointed in the year end book. There are very few pictures in the book, maybe one for every 20 recipies. I would rather continue to clip the recipies out of the magazine and get all the hints and pictures."
3,Going downhill,"This gathering of the year's recipes shows clearly how much the magazine has changed. The format has been ""updated"" to a new minimalistic style. There is so much white space on each page that I cannot help but wonder how much less my money bought than in previous years. Fortunately, the quality of the recipes and the concise instructions are still there but the pleasure of browsing through it is somewhat diminished."
5,One last mess,"Skyclad live. Good stuff. A good introduction to the early years, along with an acoustic track collection."
4,I love PIONEER audio/video receivers!,"I was skeptic about purchasing an entry level PIONEER receiver. I already own a PIONEER ELITE(flagship line) receiver. But I wanted one for the family room and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I questioned the quality before I purchased it, then when I heard it for the first time the sound BLEW ME AWAY. There are features on this model that are NOT on my flagship model that says alot about the quality of this receiver. Any first time home theater fans will not be disappointed with this item."
4,Sophomore Effort Thats Worth The Wait!!!,"If you're looking for bangin' techno Coxy, you won't find much of him here. That's not to say you won't be satisfied with what you get. This is more of a funky/tribal house effort here with some great collabs to boot. The only tracks I couldn't really get into were 3 & 4. Not to say they're bad tracks, just a little too ""Diva"" for me. I don't always mind vocals but these I could've done without. My only other gripe is the tracks were a little short in most cases & for the most part unusable in a DJ set, so if you're looking for unmixed tracks look elsewhere. Overall this is a great pumpin' album though, & all seemlessly mixed to make a non stop 66 minute groove."
5,Hammaka Hammock,"This is a great hammock, I've only used it once but I have used many other hammocks in the past. Very convienient bag attatched so it can never be lost."
4,"Convenient, lightweight, and priced right",Always enjoy the hammock but taking rope ones up and down are not only a chore but cumbersome to store.This is very light and tucks right into its own attached pouch which could fit in a large cargo pocket. Did not give it a perfect rating because the sides tend to envelope you due to the nature of the design. Could be solved by spreading each end a bit with two anchor points. More comfortable than rope hammocks in my opinion too!
4,Great item!,"This is a great item and a must have for camping. Please note that it only has hooks and it does not come with straps, so you will have to purchase straps separately."
5,Best hammock you can buy!,"This is the greatest hammock I have ever bought. It's lightweight, durable, and comfortable. I even came back and bought one for my 82 year old father because he fell in love with mine when we went camping. He used to lug a full hammock with a wooden bar around and then complain because his knees would start hurting after laying in it too long. With this hammock that doesn't happen. Not only is it the easiest thing in the world to transport but you can actually lay in it with your knees bent as much as is comfortable for you and have your legs completely supported. Just put your legs in the channel made by the outer seam line and relax. This makes a great gift for any camping or hiking enthusiast!"
5,5 years and still going strong,"I've had my Aireox 45 for 5 years and I love it. It works so well that friends with cat allergies can spend time in my apartment with no problems. The filters are not too expensive, since you only replace once a year and it is a medical grade air cleaner, not like the ionic breeze or other such phoney unit. I recommend it!"
3,With These Hands,"At long last, a much deserved reissue for one of the most underrated 80's pop bands. They released two albums on EMI in 1983 and 85, ""Get out and walk"" and ""With these hands"". After the catchy synth pop of their debut, this second effort has a much more acoustic sound with guitars and ""real"" drums, although you can still hear drum machines on some tracks. The material is catchy and reasonably well produced and doesn't sound too dated even after 15 years. The only complaint I have is that the cd clocks in at just under 43 minutes, with no bonus tracks at all and being sold at a full price. When you buy a re-release cd of a little-known album from 15 years ago, you would probably expect some extra stuff thrown in such as non-LP singles (""Apparently"" anyone?), 12"" mixes and b-sides. But alas, no such luck...Now the more pressing issue is : is anything going to happen with ""Get out and walk"" and the brilliant 12"" mixes ""For you"" and ""Muck it out""?"
2,who could ask for more,phew wow. could have been a wow if there was some bonus tracks from the get out and walk album. what song? for you .
2,"""for you"" still a classic new wave hard to find","a bonus track of studio version and remix version of ""for you"" and ""phew wow"" could have been a WOW."
4,Bonneville the fastest place on earth,"Excellent overall coverage of Bonneville & its history, lots of cool pics also."
5,Wild Thing song,"Finally after all these years I finally found the song!!! I heard it on the radio in Chicago during the John ""Records"" Landecker DJ days in the seventies when a kid and bought the 45 of it. It cracked and that was it. Thank god for the internet and Amazon.com B) Made this 47 year old very happy"
2,"Turn Me On,Dammit",(alternative Cover ) .Not a very good story no English sub tittles.Do not waist your time watching this stupid movie
3,A great concept.....it helps us to understand where we have gone wrong.,"I enjoyed the first half of the book , but did not like the format. There were so many boxed areas and repititious diagrams. Some more narrative would have been useful, as well as some nutrition information coupled with the portion advice. Still, she does a great job of exposing this huge shift in our eating patterns."
1,very poor kindle version,It turned out to be a very poor kindle version. It has tons of typos that make some of the sentances hard to read. Don't get it in kindle version.
5,Amazing quick service. Awesome CD. I love it!,I love this CD.I am replacing one I misplaced and I am so excited I found it again.It came in 2 days after ordering it!Fastest service ever!! amazing company!
3,go for the bonus tracks,"This latest release by bryan Adams features the already two years old ""Inside out""from his ""On aday like today""-Album as the main track.its a nice semi-ballad,but mr.adams has done far more catchier tunes,so not an obvious choice for a single.But the CD features two live songs,""Back to you""and ""Rock steady""which are rocked up in comparison to the studio-versions,recorded on his last tour.For Adams-collectors a satisfying buy ,the rest probably wont care ...."
1,"Yuck, yuck, YUCK!!","These are some of the nastiest and I mean NASTIEST peanut butter treats EVER!!!!There are worse things, true. But it doesn't get much worse than this...1.5 stars."
1,Not quite what I expected.,"I purchased this book because it was the only one I found that addresses only the topic of jobs and activities after retirement. Most retirement books focus on the financial aspects of retirement. If I had looked at this book in a store, I would not have purchased it. The author shares anecdotes of how some people selected the job or activity they are currently doing in retirement. I expected a much more detailed and serious listing. I do not have a desire to be a clown when I retire."
2,No Dice,"I really enjoy Dale Watson, have seen him twice live and have five of his Cd's but 27 minutes of playing time! Sorry, but I feel Iwas ripped off. Save your money and pick up a disc from the Hacienda Brothers and enjoy."
4,Sounds of the future...now!,"D.C.Cooper has done it again!This time under the moniker 'Silent Force',and featuring a German back-up band,their album is a hard-hitting one,a masterpiece of speed and melodic metal with progressive and majestic overtones,and no-nonsense lyrics.Easily one of the most original,powerful,and inspired metal albums of the year."
3,A Pretty Decent Effort,"I tend to procrastinate quite a bit, and just got around to watching this. It gives a sobering perspective of what happened just two short years ago. Now that society has essentially broken down, the advice in this video is a must have. I deducted two stars because Nimoy didn't wear Spock ears. I would have taken it much more seriously, as Spock never engaged in hyperbole. Also, without the Spock ears, Nimoy was unable to calculate probabilities with any substantive accuracy. Had Nimoy engaged in such shoddy work aboard the Enterprise, Kirk would have been dead early in the series, and there would have been no one available to gallavant through space kissing alien women while speaking in halting dramatic speech."
4,Definitely worth the price,"Being a great pessimist, I must say that I feel much better after watching this film. There are things I can easily do to prepare myself and my family for the year 2000. Wish there would have been more detailed information and less visual effects, but overall the film ""worked""."
3,Disappointed in quality of the tape,"I bought the tape thinking it would go into more detail about ways to prepare but only the last 10 minutes of the video were about that and not in any detail. The photography is also overpowering at times, with bright colors and duplication of faces...gave me a headache. I did learn more about Y2K that I wasn't aware of so it wasn't a total waste of money. This tape would be good to give to someone who doesn't have a clue about Y2K."
5,Great smelling husband,My husband loves this fragrance. We we're unable to locate this for along time. My husband comes home from a long day and tells me how many times a day he is asked about his cologne.
4,STEVEA,"GREAT SMELL HOLDS OK THROUGHT THE DAY, BUT WILL LOOSE STRENGTH, GOOD FOR PRICE AND FOR A GIFT!,MABE A TEEN OR YOUNG ADULT FOR SCHOOL."
1,circuitious,"Jumps from one point to the other without any much mentioning of the methods. Re-occuring nightmares with the corny 'English' jokes (please first develop a sense of humor) the author makes. Plus, this is definitely not a book suitable for first year students. I'm taking it right now and either the other students before me are rocket scientists but none of us seem to understand what the heck is going on! Even our instructors here at the university are experiencing problems with preparing their lecture notes. Last but not least, I wish all the other students that are currently using the same book throughout the nation, good luck in your exam! If there is any other better java books, please, please, for the mercy of god, let me know!"
1,This book isn't very good!,"I was asked to help tutor a person who was in a JAVA class that was using this book. I asked to look through his text book to see what they had learned and where they were. I was shocked at the number of incorrect examples (that wouldn't compile by the way, proving they weren't even checked), Diagrams used to replace code examples, references to a class developed by the author without actually showing the class itself, etc...This is a terrible book, I know java and I read this book, it's bad, avoid it at all costs.And thanks to the (obviously planted) first reviewer of this book, without your dishonest approval of it I might not have written this to warn people away from the book."
4,I got this at a superior price,"Cant beat the price for this nice of a watch. But the battery died only a month later, minus one star. Thats ok, $7.50 at the mall fixed that. Great watch, great price. Thanks Amazon!!!"
5,Excellent,"I've had this watch for about three years and it has been a great experience. This watch looks good on my wrist whether I wear casual or formal clothes. It sparkles during the day and night. It also feels comfortable. After three years of daily use, I just now had to replace the battery. Great buy!"
3,Warning! Not an instruction book!,"The book reads like the portfolio of the author. And the recent trend is that sculpting action figures is going toward more virtual approach, such as using a software like zbrush then feed the data into cnc milling machine or 3d printer. Personally I like the author's works and the book can provide some inspiration for budding artists, but it doesn't shed that much insight on how the sculptures are created. I'd rather suggest learning Zbrush as a vritual sculpting tool. Many sculptors recommend it because the market is shifting to Zbrush creation."
3,How can I rate this?,"I gave this 3 stars because I don't know how to rate it. It was a good price and the pills are easy to swallow, but have a slightly musty odor (it doesn't appear to me to be the odor of the vitamins themselves)."
3,OK,"Some of these stories are a little boring, others quite entertaining. One story in particular (The Big Flash by Norman Spinrad) I found quite creepy, though I'm not entirely certain why. If you read this book, I recommend skipping the Forewarning. It is long and dull and adds little to the reading experience."
4,Mother Gong - 'The Best Of' (Cleopatra),"Mother Gong is a branch of Gong, featuring none other than the space whispering goddess Gilli Smyth. It also seems that a one (make that ANOTHER) Robert Calvert is the sax player for the band. This isn't the same Calvert that was known for being Hawkwind's resident poet. Other Gongsters make an appearance or two on this 21 track compilation. Daevid Allen guests on the tripping ""Magenta Part One"" and Steve Hillage shows up on ""Machine Song"". My preferred cuts are ""Time Is A Hurrying Dog"", the soothing ""Weather"", ""Trees"", ""Wapu"" and the semi-spacey ""Quantum Impro"". Also, ""Zen"" shows the ensemble's true colors. According to the discography, Mother Gong has released fifteen lp's. I didn't realize they had that much material available. Great cosmic sounds with some really fantastic cover art."
3,Two sides,"The music is so relaxed special the saxophone, its nice to listen. But the ""singing"" and ""declamation"" makes the music itchy. It disturbs the mood you get in when you listen to the music.Price number is Lament from the ""Tree in fish"" album. Only three tracks from this album. It deserves more."
5,Required rockabilly listening,"I first heard many of these recordings when RCA released the double disc vinyl rockabilly retrospective called ""Get Hot or Go Home"" more than a decade ago. It remains one of the main reasons I still use my turntable. This may seem like a tremendous amount of money to spend on such a short disc (this disc in its entirety made up side one of Get Hot) but it is more than made up for in the timeless raw energy contained within. That phrase has been bandied about quite a bit in reference to classic rockabilly, but this is what they're talking about. The sessions with Mickey Baker (guitar) are the holy grail of this music and are absolutely incendiary. Standouts are Right Track, Cracker Jack, and Sixteen Chicks. Even the novelty title track will grow on you. Get it."
4,great NEW science fiction,"greg egan is one of the few authors who's really breaking into new territory in ""hard science"" fiction. Luminous is a collection of shorts; like so much writing in that style, they just start to open up an idea, which can sometimes be frustrating, but it's all good stuff.themes include speculation about the future results of our work with genetic manipulation, microbiology, neuroscience, genetics, nanotech. egan also has a website with 'supplemental materials' to back up the great stuff he writes about.this is definitely not cowboys in space, or the same old robot stories."
5,Perfect,This is a basic kit with many different lengths of 22ga solid wire. It works very well with elenco protoboards.
4,excelent product,"excelent product, i am happy with the result of work, i recomeded this product for yours prototyping aplications it really good"
3,"It works, but not ideal","I purchased this a few months ago, and it works well enough. But I wish I had not bought the ""preformed"" wire. This wire will work fine until things need to start overlapping on your breadboard. Then it because a serious pain to work with. I'll be replacing this soon with a flexible wire kit."
4,Decent wire set,"This is a fairly good little set. The box was broken in about 2 minutes from recieving, but the wires are great. They arrived all jumbled so you have to take the time to reorganize them. They are a little stiff and don't really like to bend or flex, so for any moving parts they may not be the best solution. However for any stationary applications they are perfect."
4,Perfect for hobbyists or labs,"I am an engineering student and i got this when i bought my arduino uno and prototype boards. This kit is perfect for making circuits quickly, and the different colors help keep everything organized. I also work in a robotics lab, and we have several of these kits there. Its hard to go wrong with pre-cut jumpers with an array of different sizes."
2,Not as pictured,"This kit is nothing like how it's pictured, the plastic box is smoky white and not see-through. There are only 12 compartments so a lot more is mixed together than pictured and even after a replacement by Amazon I received multiple jumpers that were damaged and no where near the 350 pieces that is described."
4,They're wires,"Lo-and-behold these wires do indeed conduct electricity and are good for breadboard/other electronic projects. The many sizes and color differentiators are convenient, as is the organizational box. It's a good starter package for those who don't need thousands of little jumper wires laying around, but some shallow digging around will lead you to other sources that sell larger quantities for less."
3,It wil do,"As i have yet to go through the package and count every last connector, i cannot verify how many are present. The packaging does not match the one present one the page but i guess this product will do regardless."
3,Gremlins for fun,"If you grew up watching the old Bugs Bunny cartoons, you remember ""Hare Force"" and the Gremlin. This is a nice way to get back in touch with that fun...use them as desk/monitor ornaments."
5,Great orchestra puzzle,"This is a unique, high quality puzzle, great for pre-schoolers or for students of a primary classroom."
1,Complete waste of money,"There was very little that was useful or interesting in this book. It doesn't offer any new information or insights that aren't already shared in other similar books, and it isn't helpful in guiding one when applying to selective colleges."
3,Good but hardly original,"If you are looking for a behind-the-scenes account of what really goes on during the admissions process, this is not your book. Put otherwise: if Harvard were to publish a how-to book on getting admitted to the Ivy League, this would be it. Indeed, one of the most amusing aspects of this book is the snotty style of its author - what a turn-off for all those ""regular"" students who are thinking of taking a shot at an Ivy League college! My advice: buy the book if you must, but read it with a grain of salt if you don't want to get completely discouraged!"
3,Soporific!,"Reads like a treatise on the axioms of algebra in the real number system. You'd think a Harvard man could write a more engaging book, but this one kept me reaching for NoDoz tablets."
3,Confused,"I actually haven't read this book but I can't help notice that the picture on the front is of the University of Montana campus. As a Brown student from Montana, it makes me think I should have just stayed at home!"
3,One of those films that you can appreciate,i saw this film recently&was digging the various slants&hooks it took. it went into many different directions&you really dug where it was going.it was off-beat but it works all the way.
4,NOT A BAD MOVIE,The title doesn't do this movie any justice. It has a great plot that will carry you through the end.
5,great movie,The title doesn't do this movie justice. Great acting with a great storyline equals a surprising enjoyable movie.
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book that clearly reveals the secrets to impressionist painting. First, Colley Whisson's paintings are beautifully painted and printed in this book. Second, he covers how the Impressionists handled composition, brushwork, color, color temperature, value, and subject matter, etc. Every principle is explained in writing and shown in a step by step demonstration. Following Whisson's approach can teach you to paint in the impressionistic style. Excellent book to have in your art library."
2,Found book arrangement difficult,"A College textbook or reference-type book. Comprehensive--fine print. Seemed a good read, but I didn't like the set-up. All text was in the front, and the examples and photos were grouped in the back. One would need to flip back and forth to view examples of the subject matter. Didn't work for me.This is the only reason I gave it a low rating, and returned the book."
3,"OK debut, but not as good as their 2nd...","The first album by Breton band Glaz, _Ar Gest_ is not nearly as strong as its follow-up, _Holen Ar Bed_. Although Glaz's sound is warm and lush, with a great female singer fronting a combination of rock and folk instruments, the band just doesn't seem to have found its distinct style yet. The heavy Breton influences that will appear_Holen Ar Bed_ are much more subdued here and the original tunes just don't sparkle as much. Overall, the sound is more like Iona's poppier material (minus all the Christian references) than to Celtic rock. All in all, it's not bad, but it's not nearly as great as their second album."
4,Good for decoration,"This is a good toy, the picture does not do it justice. The horse is more a dark grey, and it's more of a statue than a toy."
1,"Flimsy plot, poor writing, cliches abound","I did not enjoy this book, so I'll make my review short and to the point: It was poorly written, with a paper thin plot intended only to provide a vehicle for the author to deliver a sex- and violence-ridden story chock full of cliches, insulting stereotypical characters (the uneducated Southern redneck, the slick city boy, rich bitches, etc.) and laughable ""romantic"" entanglements like (WARNING: SPOILER FOLLOWS) lesbians in love ""turning straight"" after one weekend with a couple of good looking men. I guess Kevin Smith was right...(you'll get the reference if you've ever seen Chasing Amy; if you haven't seen the movie, I recommend watching that rather than wasting your time on this drivel). Skip this, it isn't worth reading even if it's free."
2,Contrived mess,"It started off with some potential, but rarely have I read a book which contained so many contrived situations. Everyone falls in love with someone, there are juvenile sexual scenes, as well as; a serial killer, a cliche southern red-neck, a typical 'runaway' bus station situation, and the whole family has incredible luck and timing as to run into each other a short time after arriving in LA. This truly reminds me of a story written by a twelve year (minus the sex scenes of course.) It was a waste of time and I understand why it was free."
4,A Great Beach Read!,"A family gathers in a posh California hotel, for what they believe will be a weekend of sun, fun, and catching up with long-lost family. What it turns out to be is anything but - full of secrets, lies, steamy sex and a murder mystery that will keep you guessing until almost the very end. Full of great, 3-D characters, fast paced action, with just enough erotica thrown in to keep it interesting.There are a lot of characters in this book - you may need a scorecard to keep track at first, but soon they all become like friends, and you know their quirks enough to know who they are. And some people AREN'T what you believe them to be, which will totally throw you for a loop!As the cover art suggests, this is a great book to read while sitting by the beach, by the pool, or while stuck at the airport. Heck, it's a great read anywhere!I can't wait for her next one."
3,unlinked,"I found this book hard to read, although I did read the entire book in one day. The characters were unbelievable linked and twisted to the point they were almost hard to follow. It was definitely a work of fiction. I would have rather had a more direct story line."
1,Don't buy this kit!,"I would NOT recommend this calcium kit at all! First of all, you have to buy distilled water to perform the test. The test involves distilled water, a powder that you scoop (messy and not easy to level the powder) plus two other liquid vials. Many steps to perform the test, then the test only measures by increments of 50 mg so you only know if you're between 400 and 450 mg. That is not very helpful when you are trying to increase and maintain your calcium level as I am on my salt water tank.I went on to buy the Hagen Nutrafin Calcium Test and it measures to 20 mg increments with only 3 vials. Love this one!"
5,great worth 50 bucks!!!,this cd is really funny the live tracks are really cool. if family reunion wasnt on here i would have givin this cd only 4 stars. its just a catchy toon about swearing it funny buy it.
2,Ignore this,"The issue is to have an HR scorecard for the business. The book was disappointing since it continues with the theory that originated with ""Balanced Scorecard"". It should have focussed on the actual challenges and created a robust framework.The book missed the point and an oppurtunity. It might be interesting read but no practical value."
5,It is great,"I got this textbook in a few days, and the quality is great.The seller is a wonderful guy.Good Luck!"
5,cooooooooooooooool anime,"I thought this was a great anime, lots of fast paced action and a good story line to boot. I own over 300 anime dvd and has seen almost ever type of anime and i really liked this one"
4,Great book however techique not suit enterprise development,Extentsive use of property procedures rather than use of functions in a stateless enviroment running under MTS make this book limited in value to the enterprise developer.
2,Too basic for programmers into OOD,"This book is not intended for them who are already familiar with OO concepts. Data aware classes need more attention, especially as to how to use the Data Environment in three tier designs."
1,Do NOT Buy This Book,"I wanted to give this book zero stars but amazon wouldn't let me. This book is junk, don't waste your money. If your in taking a visual basic course and they are using this as a text get some other books that have a point or can explain what they are trying to say. I recommend the Wrox book ""Beginning Visual Basic Objects"""
1,this is a terrible camera,"this camera for the first year and a half was ok, ie (kind of slow when deleting pictures). and now just a month ago it had the ""system error problem, which you either attempt to fix it yourself or spend...and have the camera sit at nikon costumer service for a month.i would advice no one to buy this camera."
1,avoid this camera,"I purchased this camera and was initially very happy. My tune quickly changed after getting a ""system error"" message which locked up the camera and made it useless. I had owned the camera less than 90 days but I still had to send it back to NIKON. They claimed it would be 7 business days to repair and we are going on 3 weeks now, its still in the shop with ""major repairs""; don't know how long it will be, they still have to fix and ship it. The scary thing is the customer service rep let it slip that some were having battery problems and I needed to try a new battery. My friend also bought the camera from a different vendor so I used his battery but the camera was still dead. I sent mine off to the repair factory. One week later, his camera came up with the same ""system error"", which I refer to as the screen of death. He had only had his for 32 days. Based on this, I cannot recommend this camera and suggest you should avoid it ."
3,Nikon Coolpix 775 Digital Camera,The camera is as good as advertized. I was out taking pictures and film clips right after it arrived. I advise getting at least a 64MB extra card with it. The 8MB that comes with it only holds about 15 pictures and you'll want a spare anyway. One major drawback. The Camera USB driver does not get along with my Dell Inspiron 5000 laptop. The only way to run it is to do a selective startup in MSCONFIG bypassing all of the programs. Tech support told me I had to reboot adding the progreams one at a time until I found the problem one or ones! I have yet to find the right one. It also appears to interfer with the computer power-save mode. So far the camera is worth doing a special start-up to down load my pictures.
4,Nikon Cool Pix 775 review,"I purchased my Nikon Coolpix 775 in Dec. of 2001. As of June 3, 2002, I have taken over 3,200 photos with this camera. I am VERY pleased with its small size and portability, the battery life, and the quality of pictures. It has a very good flash.The only disappointment I have had is that it is the equivalent of an ISO 100 speed film, and if there is much movement at allthere will be a blur. (For example, I took the camera to a basketball game and was unable to catch any of the action because everything blurred.)For portraits, landscape, and general snapshots this camera is great, and I would recommend it to anyone who is not interested in capturing sports shots."
1,Not Compatible with Windows 98!,"As of August 2001 this camera is not compatible with Windows 98 computers that have CD-burners installed (Adaptec drivers). Scott at Nikon's technical support department said they would not have even shipped this camera if they knew about this problem. The camera itself works, but Nikon clearly is better at manufacturing lenses than testing software. I could not even hook it up to my computer, thus defeating the point of a digital camera. Shame on Nikon for selling a product not compatible with the most popular operating system and CD burner software in the world."
3,a fix for system error,"I got the dread system error message - the lens would not fully retract, neither would it extend. After googling this problem I tried the multiple smacks to the back ( front, sides and ends), with and w/o the battery in, without success. Then I accidently pulled off the small front piece of plastic containing the shutter itself (while trying to aid the motor by physically pulling out the lens, and simultaneously dropped the camera on the kitchen floor from a height of, oh, three feet, and voila! a working camera. I have taken pictures with it since. Turned it on and off. Still working. Of course, it's only been an hour..."
1,Hunk of junk,"Don't buy this camera! This was the first digital camera I bought (about 18 months ago). It takes OK pictures but they were never quite in focus (what most reviewers called ""soft focus""). Then on a trip they started getting really out of focus when trying to focus at infinity. I noticed it got better when I tapped it, thus loose lens! Sent it in, 6 weeks later got it back ""cleaned"", not fixed. Sent it in again, sort of fixed, still not really sharp at infinity, worse than when I first got it. In a nutshell, customer service stinks. They would not replace the camera. The best thing that ever happened to it was I dropped it on the floor and killed it. Then I bought a Canon. What a difference! The problem with the Nikon was it does not focus in low light and instead of being smart, like focusing at 6-8ft like you were going to take a picture of someone in a room, it focuses at infinity or wherever it happens to be when it is trying to focus.Don't buy this camera!"
1,"Slow, bad focus, [not good] in low light.","This camera wasn't cheap when I got it and performance was pretty poor, given the competition. It's slow to focus so you'll never get the picture right. Its performance in low light was bad as well, with lots of noise and grain. And to make it all worse, it's not that small. It's so thick it's hard to fit in your pocket anyway. I ended up replacing it in less than a year!"
5,Great little Camera,"This is a great little camera if you are looking for a fun compact digital camera for email and photo printing. The camera is very simple to operate, and the software was a snap to load and use on the computer. The camera comes with everything you need to get started except a sufficient flash card. It comes with the 8mb flash card which is not enough to do anything with. But Nikon is not alone in supplying such little memory, just about every camera in this price range come with the same size flash card. The camera takes great pictures and is definitely a bargain. You can find them for a great price if you look hard enough."
1,The4 quality on this camera leaves something to be desired,I've had the camera for a year. It's broken twice - once under warranty and once not - and the repair cost more than a new camera with comparable features.You couldn't pay me to own another Nikon digital product - I feel totally burned.
4,Slide photo's,"The Nikon 775 is my first use of a digital camera after using a Canon EOS for many years. I am very impressed with the photo's which printed very well on a low cost epson 600. I found the macro feature very good for converting my old slides to digital (used backlite slide viewer and tripod- no problem). I have a Intel PII 400 using WinMe and found no problems using the Nikon supplied software, using PSP Ver 7.02 for editing. The only feature I miss is not having manual focus, suggest that anyone doing macro get a camera with manual focus to be sure, to be sure."
3,Washed out colors that NikonNet recommends only 4x6 prints,Immediately after purchase I took shots of my son's birthday party at the Rainforest Cafe which is admittedly low indoor light and on vacation in New Orleans where it was sunny and 80degrees fahrenheit with great outdoor weather. I was extremely disappointed upon return since I tried to print about 5 out of my best 128 ++ shots and was advised by both NikonNet and Ofoto that I shouldn't print higher than 4x6 (I shot these on Full and fine quality on a 128mb card)! Another reviewer complained about washed out colors. Don't commit to this until you try printing -the ultimate test - most anything looks good on your computer screen. Terribly disappointed because I now have a boatload of expensive addons to deal with.
4,"Probably the worst of the 4,","but still funny, I have Viva La Bam season 1 Uncensored,Haggard, Cky, & then I have the gay cky2k/3 remix, which sucks, because they cut a bunch of stuff out, I bought th first one that wasnt the stupid remix, so I didnt see all of cky3, but in my oppinion its the worst of them all, get them in this order1. Cky2k2. Cky43. Cky<landspeed>4. Cky3 ... and beware of the stupid remix of the first 3, buy the real ones while there still avalible."
4,CKY 3..AWESOME BUT TO TRENDY,"Hey, IF You Love MTV JACKASS, then you are way to unoriginal to even wiatch this movie. It's got lots of stunts and Bam antics but it's beginning to loose it's rebelious appeal. Keep it up Bam and keep it on the DL.(Down Low For All You Posers)..PS..Gotta Hate the Knoxville."
3,fun to watch but not for kids,Im a skater so I saw this video prior to the prevous two which Ive seen already in the past. The skate scenes are amazing in this video some Ive seen in other videos but there still good. Some of the skits feel drained and unwelcome like the ending skit with chris raab (that really wasnt needed) but some of the other stuff was good not as good as landspeed but better then 2k. Bam is getting repetitive with his work and needs to stick with skateboarding (I still dont know why hes pro) the jackass movie is gonna be good (trust me I know it will be good). If you want skateboarding stick with baker2g (a simallar video but with ALOT more skateboarding in it) but if you want a mix stay with this. The band cky is ok. But dinosaur jr is better.
1,not as good as it sounded like,"THIS VIDEO [stunk]!!!!! the other 2 CKY videos are amazing and the second one is the best but this 3rd one is terrible compared to them! It's all short and scripted and it's nowhere near as funny as the other 2! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! Hope this helped, peace."
1,Beware of the porn!,Watched this with my 13 year old and now he's pissed because I took it away due to the porno scene. To bad these yahoo's can't make a skate video for everyone. They feel they needed a scene of some chick giving head to some dude. What's with that?
4,...Bam-Tastic?,"CKY3 did have a lot to live up to with the greatness of CKy2K. I think that it is a good watch and does have its good moments. However, it is too short and too much is staged. There are some classic moments like Bam peeing on Phil and general stupid stunts. I would say buy it, but only if you are sure that you like CKY and you dont want anything 10 times greater than CKy2K coz this isnt it...sorry Bam!"
5,CKY3 Is The Best!!!!!,I just saw it man its funny and crazy i really enjoy the skate parts with Bam and the other guys buy this video you will laugh hard.
5,The white peppercorns...,"The white peppercorns arrived as promised and are of better quality than I expected. I wish I would've ordered a larger bag because my husband and I use a lot of white pepper when we cook and serve meals. You bet I will be placing another order very soon, if not for white peppercorns, maybe other items as well! Thank you very much for a wonderful product and keeping your promise of high quality and service! :)"
4,Don't believe everything you read,"Don't believe the review a few down, which stated the eyepiece is only for specific scopes. The eyepiece is simply a series of lenses through wiich the light cone is passed. It doesn't matter which scope you use it on.At 18mm it is low power on an ETX, so too much magnification was not the problem. It was probably a problem of focus, not enough travel in the focuser. Might have been solved by securing the eyepiece halfway in the focuser.Series 3000 plossls will work just as easily as 4000's in any scope.Be aware, this is not the 6-element 18mm wide-angle that goes for ~... elsewhere. It's a 4 element symmetrical design ..."
3,Focal length matters,"This eyepiece apparently does not do too well in a short focal length telescope like the small refectors, and provides fuzzy edges. That would probably all go away on a longer focal length scope, say f/9 to f/15. Simpler (Fewer elements) eyepieces do not generally do as well on fast f/4 to f/8 scopes. But overall this is a fairly good eyepiece for lower powers."
3,Update after receiving the eyepiece,"This is an update of my review earlier. Now that I've received the eyepiece and had a chance to try it, I'm disappointed. The outer 25-30% of it's 67 degree field is severely distorted. This means it has no more real useable FOV than a standard plossl.If I focus stars in the outer field, the on-axis view is badly out of focus, and vice-versa.I gave it a three since I used a GC I had to pay for a good portion of it. If I'd paid full price, I'd have given it a 2."
3,Magnification of an eyepiece,The amount an eyepiece magnifies is based on its focal length the focal length of the objective (telescope).To get magnification divide the focal length of the objective by focal length of the eyepiece.A 18mm eyepiece will only magnify 19x for a telescope with a focal length of 350mm. For an ETX-90 with a focal length of 1250mm the magnification is 69x. For the ETX-125 with a focal length of 1900mm the magnification is 106x.
2,Perfect Score Professional Heavy Duty Diamond Tip Glass Cutter,The Perfect Score Professional Heavy Duty Diamond Tip Glass Cutter is designed with a flimsy screw that does not securely attach the cutter head to the handle assembly.
2,buyer beware,"bought three used one, the diamond fell out after 2 uses. have not used the other two yet. will update when I do."
4,Works like its supposed to...,"Although I have not used this specific type of glass gutter before, it worked wonderfully. I am a picture framer and restorer, and am constantly called upon to cut custom sized glass. This cutter does a good job. Hopefully it will last longer than the conventional type I've been using for years."
2,Professional Heavy Duty Diamond Tip Glass Cutter,This product did not meet the standard as advertised. I will not recommend this product beyond work that involves the thinnest pieces of glass.
2,not really a ballet workout,"I danced as a child and in college, but I am not quite sure that I would refer to this video as the ballet workout... As a dancer I found it difficult to follow and extremely boring. I gave up before I got to the mat section. Based on the other reviews I will go back and revisit that area (which people say is worth it)... overall I am sure this is good for someone- just not me..."
1,Only for high-level dancers,"I have taken ballet classes off & on my whole life, so I'm familiar with classical ballet positions and terms and was excited about this DVD. But this DVD isn't ballet and there isn't any explanation or demonstration of the non-ballet moves. The end result is a workout DVD that you can't follow and can't do properly unless you are already familiar with all of the moves that Stephanie Herman has borrowed from other disciplines.In the first 20 minutes, Stephanie Herman mixes together classical ballet steps, modern ballet steps and stuff she's apparently made up -- all with absolutely no guidance on technique. You don't have to know much about ballet to know that without proper technique you can injure yourself quickly and badly.Although she does a good job reminding you about alignment and breathing, unless you are a dancer who is experienced enough to analyze the moves yourself and figure out the proper technique, I would stay away from this workout."
5,relaxing workout,"I have never attended any ballet classes before.I really enjoy the dvd, I agree this is relaxing and therapeutic, and is not a clean ballet, but mixture of ballet and pilates.do you know the moments in life that you are that tired that cannot move from your chair? or coming back from work completely tired and stressed. And you think: I would have to workout but I cannot move, I am sleepy tired etc. and you feel so bad that again you will skip the workout you wanted to have regularly...And in such state of mind I start workouting with Stephanie. the more tired I feel the more I want to relax and workout with her... and I finish and feel new born. She is so gentle! but you will feel the muscles working too.worth buying for example to workout in the moments when you are sure you wouldn't do it:))"
1,Does not perform as claimed,"I bought this video card intending to use it with two standard 19"" LCD displays. After installing it exactly as instructed, I had terrible picture quality. After two calls to tech support (25 min hold each time) I learned that actually the BizView BV200 cannot support two monitors in digital mode in their native resolutions. My choice was to bump the resolution way down or switch to analog (not as sharp). The packaging says front and center ""Dual Digital LCD Support"" It just isn't really true."
2,terrible sound,Someone as talented as Pedro Infante deserves more attention to the digital remix of his songs. The sound is scratchy and tinny.
4,Concise and clear field guide - lots of good practical info,"An excellent guide. This is a very well organized book containing style guides, some recommendations as to recognizing woods, finishes, and lots more. The bulk of the book contains a straight-forward guide to furniture organized according to type, origin, and age. There are plenty of very good illustrations, including a middle section in colour. Definately a book that is handy to bring along when you are antique hunting. The only slight criticism is that it seems to be very English/US based, i.e. would have liked to have seen more material on e.g. Italian and French items (although this is broadly covered in the 'European' section)."
4,A new interpretation of classic blues rock,"I have to admit, it was the name ""Noel Gallagher"" which first led me to investigate this new group from Manchester - Proud Mary are signed to Noel's Sour Mash record label, and he contributed with production duties (along with several other members of Oasis). However, to see these guys just as Oasis proteges is far too limiting - for one thing, the sound is very different, and the music definitely stands on its own. It's an interesting endorsement, and nothing more.This is a great album. There are shades of Tom Petty in Proud Mary's folksy, blues rock sound - it's a mellow listening experience. The production is quite simple, which is very appropriate for this kind of sound. For me, the outstanding tracks are definitely ""Just For You"" and ""Very Best Friend"", although the more I listen, the more the rest are growing on me, too! Old-style classic rock with a heady shake of American blues - a fantastic combination."
4,SOLID Acoustic Rock,"SOLID album - If you follow/like Noel Gallagher's career - you will most likely enjoy this band/album - as he played producer. Its a very acoustic guitar driven album with some electric (""Very Best Friend"").Proud Mary is not an Oasis clone, like some reviewers suggest. First, and foremost, they take their name from a CCR song - if you know Oasis, you know that they have very few American influences (least of which, Fogerty).To listen to the album you would not know the band was English. With that said, they sound a bit Stonesy (but when the Stones were really doing American Blues Rock-i.e.; Beggars Banquet, Exile, etc. They nicely cover ""salt of the earth"" but they dont reinvent the song.Overall, one of the easiest albums to just put on and let play through."
1,Much didn't make sense and sound not match the movie,Alot in the movie did not make sense. One of many examples is water leaking from the ceiling over the kitchen sink. Repairs are made under the sink? I don't think so.The worst part was the voices did not match the video about a 3/4 of the way thru the movie. The actors voices were not heard when they spoke. The sound was delayed for more then 10 seconds. From that point the movie was unwatchable.
4,Raspberries are Magic,Excellent family film for all ages! You can't find that many good movies for families like this anymore! I recommend this film for children who need the extra boost to experience life and inspire their curiosity!
5,do yourself a favor and buy this CD,"Merrie Amsterburg is one of those songwriters that shines brighter than most but doesn't get those well deserved accolades. While Little Steps and Clementine are wonderful releases on their own, Season of Rain will blow you away. I could never find the words to describe the beauty and power inherent in these songs, so do yourself a favor and buy the CD. And Merrie, I sure hope that you keep recording. The world needs to hear your voice."
2,"Okay, but not that great.","The cd is not that great. I has one good song on it--""World of Our Own Making."" I will give it that much. The rest of the songs sound so similar that they really do not stand out and get your attention. I fell asleep while listening to it. It is an okay cd, but the vocals lack in emotion."
2,Ok But not good,"First of all, this is not the do or die you may be thinking of. This is a do or die from San Fransisco I think. Not the Chicago group that did po pimp, heads or tails, or pimpin ain't dead. This album is pretty much whack. Don't get it."
1,Totally Not Appealing DVD Set,"I like both tag teams showcased in this two disc set, but I would of rather seen a 60 or 90 minute documentary on each disc showcasing both teams in ways like:- how they got into the wrestling business- how the guys became a tag team- discussion on the feuds with other tag teams- accomplishments- Interviews with other TNA wrestlers they have been in feuds with and other people that are a part of TNA- Then two to three hours of matches that are in Chronological Order (they've done this in the past why stop now)!!!!Instead we got five minute interviews and then random matches from various 2008 & 2009 ppvs (thats right no TV matches, so no MCMG vs. Speed Muscle). Unless you're a die-hard TNA, Beer Money or The Motor City Machine Guns fan do not waste your money. If you want a Tag Team DVD released by TNA pick up Best of the Tag Teams Vol.1 or Second To None: TNA's Toughest Tag Teams. They may be older releases but the DVD's seems to flow when it comes to the production."
5,Great for travel logistics and historical information,"This guide really helped us sort out how to plan our trip this summer. With maps, detailed information on the best ways to get around, and good tips on historic inns, we managed to pull off our tour of the Virginia/Maryland area really seamlessly. The book also provided a good amount of background so that everyone in our family--both the serious history buffs and the less knowledgeable among us--could understand the relevance of what we were looking at. Really made the war accessible. While there are obviously countless Civil War history books out there, this one stood out for us because of its focus on making touring easy for visitors from outside the area."
5,Excellent book for starters in insect molecular genetics,"I have found this book an excellent source of information fors researchers on this particular subject. i really enjoy browsing through the chapters. I have also found that the list of references is outstanding. i suggest this book to people that start their research in using molecular techniques applied in insects. i think though that more detailed information should be searched in other books, or even in the references."
2,"Perhaps not the ideal number of stars, but for crying out loud!","Perhaps I would not have been so disappointed had the other reviewer not produced such a glowing description of color plates and lucious images, but I just bought it new from amazon, and the book has 8 (count them, 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8) color plates- all of the rest are black and white. It looks like it will be interesting reading, and there are some lovely details in black and white, but this is an art book- on Vermeer, no less! There should be more color, certainly."
1,Not able to reveiw,"I can't seem to be able to play this DVD. I am in Australia and don't know why I can't play it on my DVD player or my DVD on my computor. I might need to return or get some help please. Maybe I have purchased an incorrect configeration for Australia?All I get on putting it into my machine is that there is ""no disc""I would like to have known if the DVD could be veiwed in Australia. Does the HD mean anything?Any help would be great please.RegardsChristine"
1,Hawaiin mythology,This DVD isn't for a beleiver in Jesus Christ. Some of its dances and chants are based on Hawaiian mythology.
1,BAD DISC - Reichel Live,"I was so excited to get this DVD and when I received it, it would NOT play.. BAD DISK, so I immediately sent it back and Amazon sent another DVD (Amazon service is AWESOME) but again the DVD would not play in my HD DVD player, my regular DVD player and I even gave it to a friend to see if it would play in his DVD player and it DID NOT... Very Frustrating..."
2,Looked cute but...,"I bought this canopy for my 6 year old daughter's birthday. She is obsessed with Tinkerbell and it looked very cute with her Tinkerbell bedding. She thought so too until she went to bed. Every few hours she would get tangled up in it and we would have to fix it. We tried tucking it in in various places around her bed, but it would inevitably fall on her face. In addition, the opening is on the opposite side of the picture of Tinkerbell so the picture is not visible when you hang the canopy over the bed. After a few days, the canopy found its way to her closet where it remains today."
3,LOVED IT!,I always loved Comic VIew. It is nice to see these shows again. I enjoyed this DVD very much. Will probably order more to add to my collection.
1,boring,"Dont waste your money. this guy ""mike bonner"" is completely boring.I couldent even watch the entire dvd. ""its that bad"".No wonder its dirt cheap. I should have figured that one out."
3,Purely for terrestrial viewing,"Only purchase the Meade 933, 45 Degree Erecting Prism if you want to use your ETX for terrestrial viewing. It doesn't really have a uselful astronomical application and tends only to diminish the quality of the object viewed in space. You don't necessarily need this for terrestrial viewing either unless you desire to see the object in its correct orientation, which is what this item is designed for. Does the job nicely in this respect. Recommended for terresrtrial viewing only."
4,works as advertises,"Same as most other reviews. Lets your telescope work like a spotting scope. Resolution drops a bit, but a correct left/right image is invaluable for terrestrial viewing, so I think it's worth while. Arrived much sooner than expected."
3,Tracklist:,1 GMT - Negative Gain (8:39)2 Codex - Subliminal (8:40)3 In R Voice - Breakthrough (7:06)4 Distortion Orchestra - Varda (8:35)5 Mekano - Land of Puu Pu (8:25)6 Pong - Exact (7:31)7 Codex - Invasion of the 5th Dimension (7:27)8 Sensphere - Distortion (8:48)9 Dark Soho - Suckobus (7:05)
1,Shame........,Shame Michigan never kept up the program and shame on the author for trivializing the horrors of state prison.
4,Biedermann and the Arsonists,"This play is about a man who harbors arsonists in his home. He believes that by becoming friends with them, he can protect his home, and they also have a secret to blackmail him with. All in all, this is a cleverly writen play which not only humorously tells the story about Biedermann but it also gives insights into Max Frisch's thoughts about the rise and fall of Nazism. I would recommend this to all intermediate German readers as it is an interesting play and an interesting comment on life."
5,Rossiter Road,"A record for those moments. Relaxed listening, not sharp, not romantic, just right. Mr. Jamal at his best and technically Class A."
4,tight fit,Love the 2X barlow lens. It performs as stated by Meade. All lenses used in conjuntion with the Barlow are doubled I saw no degredation of objects viewed at all. The lens fit very tight in my first telescope but perfectly in my second.
3,Works well,"This is a no-frills Barlow lens. It works well, as long as you know that, for example, using it with a 4mm eyepiece in a 70mm scope isn't recommended. As noted, it will double the magnifying power of your scope, but more magnification isn't always a good thing. It will make your view dimmer and more fuzzy, especially if you are magnifying past the maximum useful magnification. Still, it is a good, functional instrument, and works well. What more do you want?"
3,ETX-90 plus this lens,As expected the Meade 2X Barlow appears to double the power on my Meade ETX-90 but it also slightly fuzzes the image. It's interesting to use this lens but it's definately not a show stopper.
1,Poor fit & finish,2x Barlow Lens was not worth the price as it was slightly too large to properly fit my Meade Scope(t00 thickly plated). This was a sign to me that Meade is not the Quality concerned organization they advertise themselves to be...
2,LIL KIM WANNA-BE !! YA KNO ?,I THINK SHE CAME OUT TRYIN TO BUST HER LYRICS LIKE LIL KIM -- I DON'T THINK SO! SHE DIDN'T COME OUT TIGHT LIKE HER OLD ALBUM. I THINK SHE'S TRYIN TO HARD. SORRY FOXY BUT PEEPS SAY YOU AIN'T FOXY NO MORE!
1,If I could I would give Foxxy NEGATIVE TWO STARS!!!!!,"Look out 'Lil Kim, she already stole your image, now she after your voice too. Def Jam ought to drop Foxxy like a Thurman Thomas fumble in the Super Bowl. That ""Hot Spot"" is wack, nah check that, it's WAAAAAAA-AAAAAAAA-AAAAAAA-CCCCCKKK!!!!!!!!!! as hell. I don't wanna even discuss the rest man, my stomach's starting to hurt. Peace, from the toilet bowl, I'm out."
1,"All image, no talent","Foxy Brown is a dis to the hip-hop community. I'm sick of hearing all this commerical stuff and calling it hip-hop. This album is WAAAACK. Foxy, make a album when you develop your skills, aright. PEACE."
2,BAD,"FOXY BROWN HAS NO CLASS!!! The thing is there are little children who listen to this record and its no good for them. It is bad enough that men are cursing out people it makes no sense because she's supposed to be a lady. That's whats wrong with the world to day, too much sex."
4,Better than I expected,I gotta be honest: I didn't really think that I would like this one cause the first one was kinda wack. But obviously she learned her lesson on the second album. The song she does with Mia X and Gangsta Boo is tight!! And of course the one with Jigga is up there too.
1,A LOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME,"THIS CHILD IS NOT WHO YOU WANT TO BE SEEN IN PUBLIC WITH, LET ALONE TAKE HOME TO MAMA. SHE NEEDS TO REALIZE THAT A WOMAN DOES NOT NEED TO EXPOSE SO MUCH OF HERSELF THAT SHE LEAVES NOTHING TO BE IMAGINED. HER LYRICS ARE DISTASTEFUL AND MORE DEGRADING THAN ANY MAN COULD EVER SAY. HER LATEST VIDEO SHOWS A NAGGING BULGE IN HER MIDDLE AND SHE LOOKED AS THOUGH SHE COULDN'T BREATHE IN THOSE UTENSILS SHE WORE. HER DANCERS LOOKED WAY BETTER THAN SHE DID WHICH IS ANOTHER SHAME. SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE ON THE SET THAT WAS UGLY AND DISGUSTING TO LOOK AT. AND SHE WAS THE STAR?"
1,the only song I ever liked by her was BIG BAD MAMMA!,"Yeah she is big(as in fatness)and she is bad, as in her quality of music sux!! Everytime i see her i think...SLUT! i'm sorry, look at what that girl wears! Whatever it was that she was wearing in her video ""HOT SPOT"" it totally did not flatter her fat a** stomach and she can't dance! Hey guys lets shuffle our feet and make it look like we got dancing skills! the girl is totally materialistic and she is probably just trying to make it in the music business because she knows you can make alot of money that way. What a foolish woman. Sorry to all you foxy wannabees but she ain't got s**t going on for her and she needs to get out of the music business quick. This cd is horrible and having guest stars ain't helping. Sorry foxy . Hey at least i didn't compare her to lil Kim"
5,I thought Foxy Brown's album was off the hook!,Foxy Brown just keeps getting better and better. Her beats and rhymes really make the album a success! People just envy her cause she's makin' it. STOP HATIN'!! Do your thing Foxy! Make that money.
2,"she could have wore something better, she look like a tramp.","I WOULD LIKE HER TO CLEAN-UP HER ACT AND HER MOUTH AND SHOW A BETTER IMAGE OF HERSELF.FOXY IS A VERY PRETTY GIRL AND I WOULD LIKE TO MEET HER AND FIND OUT WHAT SHE IS REALY LIKE BEHIND HER MUSIC, BEFORE I MAKE UP MY MIND TOTALLY ABOUT HER."
2,Why is she biting styles when she is better than that?,This album has samples if you want samples!!!!!Foxy has alot more talent than that but overall it could have been better.
3,"LIL'FOXY, I MEAN BROWN KIM, STOP BITIN' STYLES!!!","I think that FOXY BROWN needs to reconstruct her rhymin' style to fit FOXY not LIL' KIM! When I first heard ""HOT SPOT"" at the club my cru was like ""yo! this new LIL'KIM joint is off the meat rack!"" only to find out it's FOXY's joint.Now let me tell you I like both ladies but when it comes to bitin' that's a violation!!WHAT!WHAT! Let's take it back to when she rocked on Aint no Ni$@a! or that joint she did with L.L.COOL-J.or her Ill Na Na album nahmean. It sounds like ""you wanna B. like the Queen B. but you can't B. that's you're madd at me."" Come on Foxy!,I remember I met you at the Black Expo while back, you was givin' ni##as a run fo'dey doe!! I'm still showin' luv but let's take it back to da' start ""Big Wilma"" style and you'll get da' more positive and less negative. Peezzz Owwut!! str8 frum da'gettoe FUNKMASTER K.G. BigDawg style ROWF!,ROWF!"
3,Pretty Tight. . . . leaves you wanting more,"Foxy Brown's Chyna Doll gives you a different more personal look into this talented rapper's life. Tracks like Hot Spot, Job, and I Can't will stay spinning on your hot 97. For those who represent the ""dirty south"" na na provides BWA and Ride. Old-schoolers will get down to Tramp. Where the album falters is not in the lyrics, in fact, Foxy's (a la Jay-Z) lyrics are tight. IT'S THE BEATS!!! Still, don't sleep. If you liked Ill Na Na, pick it up. Better things to come."
3,"CHYNA DOLL: GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT.","CHYNA DOLL IS A VERY GOOD LP. BUT IN COMPARISION TO ILL NA NA, THE ALBUM IS GARBAGE. STRONG TRACKS LIKE: A DOG AND A FOX, 4-5-6, MY LIFE, AND HOT SPOT DON'T HOLD THAT MUCH WEIGHT ON THIS MEDICORE LP. IF YOU ARE A TRUE FOXY FAN, GO GET THIS ALBUM. IF NOT, WAIT FOR LIL' KIM."
3,It was pretty GoOd,it was pretty good but I think that she realy do sound like lil kim but i hope that she dont do like lil kim did giong down south if you know what i mean!!! I realy like the cd cover my self Personaly!!!11
3,MIXED BAG = MIXED REVIEW,"Foxy's second CD Chyna Doll features a mix of tracks, which leads me to give it a mixed review. Three strong songs open the CD, with My Life possibly being Foxy's best song ever. JOB, Hot Spot and I Can't are just jams. Bonnie And Clyde Part II is another good hook up with Jay-Z. The songs that give it a mixed review from me are muddled by guest stars. Eightball, MJG, Juvenile, Beanie Siegel, Memphis Bleek, Pretty Boy, Too Short, Noreaga, Mia X and Gangsta Boo all guest star on 6 or the last 8 songs, which pushes Foxy out of the spotlight on her own CD! Next time Foxy, leave out all the guests, and do it all on your own."
3,Couple Good Tracks,"This album was actually the first time I heard Foxy. It definitely has it high points, but mainly brought down with low ones. A lot of forgettable tracks, that aren't bad but are boring, but there are a lot of bad tracks too. Fox shines the most on the tracks that she's on by herself, which isn't a lot. This album got me listening but her first album ""Ill Na Na"" made me a fan. The albums stand outs are Hot Spot and My Life. But I Can't, Dog and a Fox, and J.O.B. are also worth a listen. If your a fan of Fox I suggest giving this album a listen, but if you're not I suggest passing this one, and going for Ill Na Na or her best Broken Silence."
2,This chyna doll is not worh collecting,"Foxy Brown - Chyna Doll (Def Jam, 1998)Foxy sounds too much like Lil' Kim on this album, from her ""whoas"" to her higher-pitched voice to her flow. Her lyrics and songs are very subpar compared to her previous album, Ill Na Na. Truly, the guest stars and production save this album from the drink coaster treatment, including Memphis Bleek, Juvenile, DMX, and of course, Jay-Z. A sophomore album that faced the sophomore jinx due to a sophomoric performance. -EJR"
4,SEE YOU AT THE HOT SPOT!!!!!,THIS IS A GOOD CD. FOXY TELLS HER STORY IN EVERY SONG SHE PUTS DOWN. CHYNA WHITE IS DA BOMB!
2,RAPPERS CAN'T BE MILLI VANILLI!,"(They were at the top of Billboard, too). She said on MTV that she wrote SOME of this album. WHAT!?"
2,It ain't all THAT!!!,"I was actually disappointed by this album. The only listenable songs is Hot Spot, and JOB with Mya. It just wasn't good. Sorry :( I thought it could have been better. Peace!!"
4,Better than Ill-NaNa,"She matured alot this time around. Track's 5,4,and 17 are the higher points on tne album. Foxy could have left off, Job (featuring Mya) if you ask me, because I personally think that they could have done alot better. Foxy's voice sometimes comes off sounding like Lil' Kim's what's up with that I do not know."
2,WHAT IS THIS?!,"Y'all know this girl don't write her own $#!+. I don't like rappers who talk big $#!+ and its coming from some one else's mouth. Rap and hip hop is about the lyrics, and whoever writes the $#!+ should say it. I like the other rappers on the CD, though. Just like when Dr. Dre gets credit for makin beats when Stu-B-Doo did it; y'all know that $#!+ aint right! Peace!"
1,Nasty and non lyricall,"First off let me tell Foxy that she is not The Queen Bee, so she needs to stop biting. Second Foxy you are not a good rapper and need to stop rapping. Third your CD is the dumbest CD and you need to stop putting out the CDs too."
2,Chyna Doll??? are you??,"the song ""hot spot"" has great beats in it, and that's why i give you 2 stars. however, i have a big comment to make. i am an oringional Chinese, and from your looking, you don't look like a china doll at all. please don't use the name 'cuz it's a shame of my country!!! oh! by the way, do you think you look good?? put on some clothes and cover those fat (not phat) part!! or if you still want to show your body, go to the gym, girl! oh, the last thing, do you really know what the 3 Chinese letters on the cover of your album mean?? i don't know if the person who wrote that is a Chinese, but he or she certainly needs to take the very very very basic Chinese course. i guess ya probably translate those words from English to Chinese, but it ""don't"" make any damn sense at all. instead, it made Chinese laugh hard !!"
1,Cant Believe,"I cant believe Foxy Brown had the nerve to make a cd featuring Juvenile and Mia-X...Juvenile from Ca$h Money and Mia-X from No Limit,everyone know these to Labels hating on each other and she had the nerve to put these two on the same album"
1,Foxy can't compare to Lil Kim!!,"Foxy's lyrics are wack. Her style is sloppy, and she is not that experienced, as far as the music goes, or the dancing in her videos. Give it up girl......get a real job!! Music is not your forte."
1,not ill na na,"This album is nowhere near as good as her first one. And she needs to put on some damn clothes, she ain't all dat!"
2,TRY AGAIN FOXY!... You can't.,"This wasn't worth my money at all! I don't know why I got it. I don't care if you go back to the ILL NA NA style, you still don't have that energy anymore. Actually, you never had it. You still don't have what you didn't have in the first place."
1,Sluth,"what is this. you should be ashamed of yourself . this suck big time. you cant rap and you try to play n your looks. but your fat and ugly go drop dead. HOT SPOT, yeah my infrared beam makes a hotspot on your forehead tramp"
4,Cool Kool Cool CD,I loved this CD...I defintly like it better then her first and third. I love most of all the songs. It is a awesome CD and is worth the price. Foxy has outdone herself on this one.
5,WHAT A HOTTIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,IF SHE WAS ANY MORE ATTRACTIVE IT WOULD BE COUNTED AS ARSON.OH SHE IS ALSO THE ONLY FEMALE RAPPER THAT'S ANY GOOD.KEEP THEM COMING FOXY
5,Off the hook!!,Foxy Brown's CD was off the hook. I listened to this CD everywhere I go. I even brought it twice after moving and it got lost. I love and admire Foxy Brown because I relate to her stories. People often say I look like Foxy. Everyone calls me Lil' Foxy. I am from GA Baby. I would really like the chance to kick it with Foxy Brown one day.
2,not good,"This album has what, about 2 songs that are ok. ""A DOG & AND A FOX"" AND ""I Can't"" I enjoyed, but the rest of the album was a waste of money and space on the shelves."
5,This cd is amazing,"The record, the beats, the lyrics, the pictures, the guests, the songs-couldn't have been better. foxy is the only female in rap history to ever have her sopohmore record debut at number one, and is the only female rapper to ever make it to number one ever in female rap history. kim can't even compare to foxy any more. hardcore was good but ill na na was better and chyna doll is better too. foxy has a new song out ""na na be like"" and a new album coming out on January 16th entitled- Inga Marchard-Past Present Future. Have we heard anything from kim since 96? does she have a new song no! foxy is the future kim is in the past, long gone and never comming back!"
1,Pure Garbage,"first off mami changed her voice up, bit kimmy's style and flooded the album with commercial and radio friendly joints. besides the grimey noreaga joint, ever song was invented for radio airplay, and was highly commercialized when she through on every rapper that ever scored a platinum record.hot spot was a weak first single, and nobody even knew that she came out with i can't, even though it was the album's best song. also she left off that hot joint wit janet jackson, which is probably her best work to date. chyna white was the worst song ever. ill na na was a hot record, but mami slipped up big on this one right her."
1,THIS CD IS JUST WACK,"This is the most tiresome CD i've ever heard, it will be put in my trash in five minues. Foxy Brown is trying to be like Lil Kim and is doing a bad job of it! Her track Ride Down SOuth is the wackest song. Get a new talent Foxy because your lyrics are wack!"
4,Ill N.A.N.A. on a roll!!,"This is a tight new album from foxy brown. You can definetaly tell that she wrote the lyrics on most of these songs which I give extra credit to her for that. When people like toni braxton dosen't write lyrics but only sings it's alright, but when it's others like foxy it's not. Rumors block the truth from showing and the truth is that she does have some skills. Jay-z said it him self in Source magazine. A definete must buy for your rap collection!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,a big disappointment for a little camera,Most of my pictures came out grainy and some had the sun reflecting off the lense. The better pictures were closeups. You'll definitely need the flash for every picture.
1,To bad it doesn't last long...,"Got this on July 29th and was very happy with it, sturdy, bright but here it is Sept. 13 and it's burnt out and no longer works...not even worth the $10+shipping...don't buy this light."
2,Unreliable LCD,"I bought a dell computer equiped with E172FP LCD in the last year. A couple days ago, the LCD suddenly turned blank without giving any noise or smoke. Since then, the LCD can only light up for about 5 seconds after turned on."
2,power supply died in less than 2 yrs,"I bought my Dell E172FP monitor less than two years ago and it has died -- appears to be a power supply issue. It was good as long as it lasted, but I expected it to last longer. My old CRTs are still running after 10 years."
2,Mine died as well,"After three years I turned my PC on and the screen flickers and dies with the power button flashing on and off, exactly the same problem as others posting here."
2,very bad recording,This is an old movie and not updated technologically.It looks like a copy of a copy of a copy.
1,Buyer Beware,"Please note - this rating refers to the product quality and not the actual movie itself!Be sure to note the description before purchasing. This is a DVD-R, not an official release. I didn't think it would play on my computer (and indeed it would not) but I assumed that it would play in my DVD player. No such luck. I tried three of them, in fact, and none of them would read the disc. Maybe you will have better luck. But the more important point is that this movie is of great historical interest to anyone studying the history of film musicals and early sound cinema. It was a major release at the time in 1929, has been immortalized by 1952's Singin' in the Rain, and deserves a proper reissue."
5,Very well written,"A very well written book on a subject that is not very well understood. This is the first book of Clark's that I have read, and am looking forward to reading more of his writings.Clark presents, in a logical fashion, his case supporting the Biblical doctrine of Predestination, and quite effectively, in my opinion, destroys the arguments of its opponents. In a case such as this, the only appropriate argument is one based in Scripture, and Clark does exactly that; he presents the Scriptures that form the ""backbone"" of the Doctrine, and also many other supporting verses, sometimes bringing out concepts that I had never noticed before."
5,"My favorite, favorite rock band, ever. No exaggeration.","I found this CD at a now-defunct record store in my hometown of Palo Alto. I listened to it for kicks when I was in high school, but over the next decade, I learned to really appreciate Mark Rivers (the genius behind Poundcake) and his unparalleled expertise in rocking. What truly great songwriting this is, and what a perfect, perfect production job, too.I've re-discovered Mr. Rivers and look up to him anew given that I'm interested in writing music for television, which is his main gig these days.If you thought Weezer was sheer genius when you were in high school (or still do) and don't believe anyone in the rock world to be mightier, give this a spin. If your mind is open, you'll thank me."
3,Didn't work.,"The book was interesting and informative, yet...tried this method for a girl and it didn't work. Still love my 2nd son very much, but continue to yearn for a daughter. Bottom line is, if you really, really want 1 gender, you need to invest in proven high-tech methods rather than try-it-at-home. Studies show at-home methods improve chances to only maybe 60-70 % (if that and only if done precisely, which is very hard to do), while high-tech methods have much higher success rates, though these are expensive, time-consuming, emotionally draining and still have no guarantee of success. Due to family Hx of mostly boys, will probably have to consider 1 of high-tech methods (PGD or MicroSort) or adoption. [...]"
1,Shettles' method is pseudoscience,"One of the basis of the scientific method is the reproducibility of the results. Dr Shettles is the only one who has performed positive studies of is method. In fact, scientific evidences show the opposite of Dr Shettles' claims, that is to say ""the timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation has no bearing on the sex of the baby""1.This book is one among millions showing how human beings are gullible and can believe almost anything, especially when it sounds scientific.1. Wilcox, A. J., C. R. Weinberg, et al. (1995). ""Timing of sexual intercourse in relation to ovulation. Effects on the probability of conception, survival of the pregnancy, and sex of the baby."" N Engl J Med 333(23): 1517-21."
5,It Definitely Works!,"We have three wonderful boys but we still wanted a little girl to complete our family. I had read other books and understood that the sex of the baby is all in the timing in most cases. I bought this book, read every single page cover to cover and practiced all the things it said to do. I charted my cycle for 4 months and then we began trying. We did everything the book instructed us to do and I became pregant immediately after we started trying. A sonogram later confirmed the baby was a little girl and our dreams were fulfilled. This book definitely works if you are willing to follow all the instructions and not get lazy about what you need to do. Your chances of having a boy are greater then having a girl. Having a girl requires a little more effort to nail down the timing but the end result is well worth it. I would recommend this book to anyone trying for either a boy or a girl."
3,Lots of personal stories,I wanted to know about gender prediction. Shettles is a leading researcher in the field. This book could have been condensed by offering a website for personal stories about successes.
5,"outstanding, thoughtful book","Love this book! Worked for both of my pregnancies, my mother, and my best friend. Includes information on common objections and even religious concerns for anyone who may feel uneasy wishing for a specific gender."
4,BOY did it work for us!,"I only used about 3 or 4 pages of this book. There is a LOT of information in here that I chose not to use but can be helpful to others who want to track their cycles. I tracked ovulation using a home ovulation prediction kit and followed the instructions given on the applicable pages. We also followed the tips and advice for a boy. Who's to say if it was fate, luck, chance, or the book? I don't know, but we are happy to say our son is due in the spring after about 3 months of trying. I say it can't hurt to try :)"
4,very pleased,"tho i havnt been able to put it to the test yet after reading it and asking my own dr. some questions its aparent that if you follow the books addvice it will help increase your chances, of getting the disired sex of your next baby i cant wait till next fall to test it myself."
1,Be careful!,"I followed this book to the T. We were trying for a girl after two boys. I thought since this method had worked with my mother and sister in conceiving boys, I was a shoo in if I followed it. And I did. We got pg the first month with a healthy baby BOY. Do not put all of your eggs in one basket. Even if you religiously follow the book, the odds are still pretty equal and you will feel like a fool for following a book and still getting the opposite gender!"
2,"Sounds very authentic, but doesn't work!","I tried the Shettles method for my third child, and can tell you with all certainty that it doesn't work. I am having a third boy and am very disappointed that I had wasted a lot of time and money on Shettles books, but most importantly, I feel very sad that I had poured my heart and soul into believing in the method. I sincerely believed in the Shettles theory, it sounded very authentic and proven with statistical data. Since I had followed it every step of the way, I was sure I would be having a girl. Now, I'll be raising a soccer team, which is OK, but the reason I got pregnant with N3 was the desire to have a girl and strong belief in the Shettles method. My advice, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON HIS BOOKS, maybe, there is something else there that works."
3,"No outcome, yet.","This was a really interesting book. We have not started on the actual conceiving, yet, but are really anxious to see the end result. I have heard that this book works, but if anything, it teaches you a lot about the process."
2,It's Okay,"I wasn't a huge fan of this book. It does have SOME useful information, but for the most part, I was very bored."
3,Don't know if it worked or not.,"Well we started to use the methods in the book. My husband skipped right to the part on what to do to concieve the sex you want. I tried to read the whole book. There is just a lot of junk before you get to the good stuff. I won't be able to tell you if it worked or not though, we got pregnant before we got to try the methods."
3,Repetative and useless information,"I gave this book 3 stars because some of the information was indeed valuable.But the first 100 pages were completely irrelevant. Its called how to choose the sex of your baby yet he speaks of what aristotle thought. Who cares? History is wonderful and all but is it worth 100 pages?The repetition comes in the chapters where it talks specifically how to try for a boy or a girl. It tells you to read both chapters no matter what you are trying for but repeats the same thing. Out of the 230 pages, i have a page and a half of notes. I recommend you borrow a copy of this from the library. It honestly isnt worth adorning your shelves with."
3,Good book,I wish it was more straight forward directions . This book was recommended by the nurses at my doctors office.
5,this works,"i bought the earlier edition, about 15yrs ago, and followed the book, i had a daughter.... i just purchased this for someone i know who might want a girl as well...read it try it, no regrets"
5,The best money I ever spent....It worked for us.,"After researching for a few months we decided to go with this method. We followed it,giving attention to every details. We really wanted a boy, had my sano yesterday and we're having a boy....our family is now complete with a boy and girl. :-)"
5,Jeez,Bunch of good movies all in ONE BOX! plus at a sick value. My friends and I watch one of these movies at least one a week
5,Unbeatable comedies/price!,This is a really great compilation of comedies and for an unbeatable price. The special features make these even more bang for the buck. It's a great way to start rebuilding your comedy collection on Blu-ray.
4,Great present for your boyfriend,"I actually saw this advertised in Cosmopolitan magizine as a ""great present for your guy"" and I thought, ""Wow! That would be a great present for my guy!"" All three movies are hilarious, and it's a great deal to buy all three together. These are the unrated versions, so there's lots of drug references, sex jokes and nudity, so keep these DVDs on the top shelf if you've got kids."
1,The films are 5 star. This collection is 1 star for price alone.,"I love all three of these movies. They are great comedies and I could watch them over and over again. But at the current ~$54 price tag, I would much rather purchase the three movies separately on Blu-ray at their current prices. $9.99 each forThe 40-Year-Old Virgin [Blu-ray] andKnocked Up [Blu-ray]. $10.49 forForgetting Sarah Marshall [Blu-ray].Don't get me wrong, the idea of having these three in a collection is great. Just try to make it completely worthwhile."
5,3 great comedies for a great price,I'm very picky on comedies. I haven't laughed out loud so many times in the 40 year old virgin or Sarah Marshall since the Naked Gun movie series.
3,logo missing,"I really liked how it looked and ordered it as a gift for my friend, but it turned out, that the round sign (logo) where there should be written - Daniel, is empty. There is no DANIEL written on any part of the bag. The round sign is absolutely empty. Does it mean, that I received not genuine product? As it was the gift, for me it was important not to have deffective product."
2,Disappointing,The leather had a moth ball kind of smell that would not air out even after a few days. Because of this and quality of the item being less than I expected I returned the travel bag.
3,Disappointed,"The book and illustrations are great, but some of the enlargement directions are wrong and directions are a bit scarce. Evidently the directions and enlargements were not tested before printing!! What ashame!!"
4,Ideas,"Lots of ideas for making greeting cards. This book contains many color photographs, step-by-step instructions, and cute ideas for card making."
4,"Celebrating ""Sweet 15""","As we were planning my daughter's Quinceanera, we purchased this book to share with my daughter's friends and family members who were not familiar with the latin culture of the Quinceanera. This book shares the Quinceanera of two different girls and how special the Quinceanera really is. This book helped our friends understand why the Quinceanera was important to my daughter and insight into the latin culture"
2,not what he used to be,"First off, let me say that I'm a diehard junglist, and I have followed Dieselboy since he was a small-time DJ in Pittsburgh. His older CDs are some of my absolute favs, epecially the 611 mix and System Upgrade. However, this mix is just.... bleh! The mixing is still tight, but the track selection is really lacking. Maybe if you're new to electronic music and like trance you would enjoy some of these tunes, but I don't really want to listen to BT, Tiesto, or Sasha. There are a couple of killer tracks, like Tech Itch and Teebee, but mostly it's just cheesy trance with a 2-step beat on top. If you're looking for seriously dark dnb, Dieselboy's earlier stuff is far superior."
2,"Hard, but no cigar","Nothing changes, DSL keeps pushing the hard-beats, but this CD doesn't grip you. As for it taking on your a quote ""Drum & Bass journey"", I'm not feeling it. True these are some interesting remixes, but this mix is so typical. Unlike the new Dara (which everyone hates, don't know why??) that at least tries to showcase the many styles of DnB, DSL falls short. As for disc 2, its pointless, pure crap. If your looking for something incredible your not going to find it on Dungeonmaster's Guide, but if your looking to jump on the band wagon this CD is for you."
3,Decent,Tracks 1-7 Badass but when he gets in to the House trance etc etc remixes it SUCKS!!!! If the start of the cd is techstep and hardstep why the hell would he just jump into crappy remixes of over rated crappy tracks from over rated *(&%*holes. If you wanna listen to about 20-30 min of good music buy this cd.
2,Nothing Special,"Ok. Ive been listening to Jungle/Drum & Bass, whatever you wanna call it since 1995 and Dieselboy since 1997 when 97 Octane came out. Since then ive collected all his cds, seen him live, got autographs and everything else that go's along with being a fan. Enuff background, ive come to expect quality from Dieselboy and with this cd all I can say is that is just ok. Not one particular track sticks out in my mind. Its not terrible, but Ive heard it all the way through 2 or 3 times and that will probably be it. O-Well, Hopefully the New Dj Dara Cd will be better."
4,Whaa???,"Dungeonmasters Guide was a good CD. It is quick and is unique but still recognizably Diselboy, however, i liked the Dieselboy that produced the best DnB album of Project Human. I guess it is hard to keep on improving one of the greatest hard DnB sounds found in that album. In DMG, It is a touch softer with less pumping bass but still very fast paced with hints of trance at the end. It may not sound appealing to some but i really like the song which diselboy did with dj tiesto. All in all, this is a pretty good CD but in my opinion, this cd gets a 4 stars because it couldn't appeal to me as much as the older Project Human."
4,"Tight mixing skills as usual, haters hate on as always.","Another solid effort by the Dieselboy. Not every track is my taste but WTF, its a bangin mix regardless. Yeah, we listen to Jungle and all styles of DnB. You laugh at the Drums and the Bass because you cannot comprehend it. If you're disrespecting Jungle then you have already lost any credibility. Oh yeah, and DJ Gremlin sucks so hard....go and spin some more Nelly tunes biiiiach. Too hilarious... lol"
5,Great Baby Book for tracking milestones,"I have purchased this book for both my son and my daughter and love it! The page layout covers the whole first year of baby's life. You have pages for each month. There was room to put every detail in from doctor's visits to holidays. I was able to put baby hospital bracelets, first haircuts, you name it and there was a space for it. What a great book for keeping up with all of baby's remarkable firsts! I recommend this one whether you like the Babar theme or not!"
5,Excellent - My choice after browsing thru MANY books,I must have flipped through 15+ baby books and this is the one I took home. It's very cute and there is room to fill in extra details if you want. I love the flow of the book and the pictures it asks for. I would have LOVED it if my mother had filled out a book just like this one for me. I'm enjoying filling it out for our April '08 arrival.
1,shocked!,"O.K., i must admit the last Bianchi product i purchased, was more than 20 years ago. I remember the name was synonimous with ""American made"" quality! Upon receiving this product, i was totally shocked as it looked, AND felt cheap! Couldn't help but wondered ""where have the American jobs, and American quality gone? MEXICO!!!!!! If you're in the market for a durable, well made belt, look elsewhere........."
3,Decent effort...,"This is a decent effort of packaging a Greatest Hits Live video release overall, good selection of songs but it fails in a few areas..A) Three songs (Every Breath, Every Little Thing She Does, The Bed's Too Big) are used in the backround over video footage. It would of been nicer seeing that this is supposed to be live material to have live performances of these on here (okay, minus Every Little Thing.. the live version they did [is bad] - Gateshead 82 need I say more).B) Demolition Man from the Gateshead 82 concert is actually toned down aka edited due to Sting's several uses of [profanities] during the song (to those who want the full unedited version its on the ""Ghost In The Machine Live"" video release).Otherwise, decent effort."
4,Sting - a staple of the minivan CD player.,"The Police where a great group for a few years, and this video adequately captures that magic. More importantly, I think it shows that Sting's arrogance is the reason The Police no longer exist.One can point to Sting's commercially successful solo career and say that he is clearly the reason for the success of the Police. However, Brittney Spears sells a lot of records and is not exactly the world's best musician. Sting is Brittney for 40 year old women - a subject of the tantric fantasies that sustain these women as they drive the kids from piano lessons to soccer practice. Yes, Sting is a staple of minivan CD players around the country.From watching this video we clearly learn that Stewart, Miles, and Andy drove the band and Sting was not only the least talented musician in the band, but really just Stewart's bass player."
1,Very Incomplete,"This book is woeful - 300 pages or so is just a short guide, nothing like a reference book at all. Use the man pages instead. There is very little contribution from the author."
5,The best way to implement the most frequently used commands,"John Mulligan's Solaris 8 Essential Reference provides clear and concise instruction on how to perform important administration and management tasks using the latest edition of Solaris, as well as how to use some of the more powerful commands and more advanced topics found in Solaris version 2.6 through version 8. The scope of Solaris 8 Essential Reference includes the best way to implement the most frequently used commands, deal with shell scripting, administer your own system, and utilize effective security. Very highly recommended instructional reference and a ""must"" for new Solaris users. 400 pp."
2,Joe B-Stay with your touring band!,"The musicianship of Joe Bonamassa, Jason Bonham and Derek Sherinian is overshadowed by the shallow playing, annoying grimaces and silly stage antics of Glenn Hughes. If you want to feel and hear a bass line that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts, check out Carmine Rojas on Joe B's DVD/Blu-ray ""Live at The Royal Albert Hall""--a jaw-dropping concert that's exponentially better than this road show."
2,Joe Bonamassa-Stick with your touring band!,"The musicianship of Joe Bonamassa, Jason Bonham and Derek Sherinian is overshadowed by the shallow playing, annoying grimaces and silly stage antics of Glenn Hughes. If you want to feel and hear a bass line that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts, check out Carmine Rojas on Joe B's DVD/Blu-ray ""Live at The Royal Albert Hall""--a jaw-dropping concert that's exponentially better than this road show."
5,great show,"Ordered this from Joe Bonamassa's website and it came in yesterday over a week before the official release. This is the closest I will ever get to see this band live so to me it is well worth the purchase. The DVD is well produced, the sound is great and the band is ,well what else to expect but great."
4,Performance is great,"The concert is great.No so sure I like the way it was shot or filmed.Could just be the producer's style.Overall, pleased with my purchase."
3,BCC Live Review,"An AllStar band formed by Glenn Hughes. It features some great ""licks"" by Joe Bonamassa. Joe is better by himself with his own band in my opinion. Sometimes a collection of All Stars doesnt quite work. Hughes is better in Deep Purple and Bonham was better in Foreigner and other projects and, as I said, Bonamassa is better as solo artist with his own backing band. The quality of his Blu-ray concert at Royal Albert Hall is better than this one in all respects. The Highlite of the concert is Bonamassa's ""Ballad of John Henry"" which allows each performer to ""do his thing""."
2,This isn't Joe Bonamassa,This is not the Joe Bonamassa that was at the Royal Albert Hall!!!!I didn't even watch the whole DVD.
5,WHY 2:35 aspect ratio?,"This is a great group...terrific show...and cool bonus features on the second disc ...a strong value for money!It is not 1:33 aspect ratio as amazon.com states which is old 4x3 full screen, but sadly its also not the current 1:78 or 1:85 but the older movie extreme widescreen ratio of 2:35 which means even with current state of the art widescreen tvs we will either have to crop image or have dead space at the top and bottom... sorry if this seems picky it just seems odd that when the world has standardized on a widescreen size they would purposely shoot this format ....I am a purchaser and have written this after viewing not after reading specs etc. and again sorry to sound picky but it leaves about 1/4th of the screen black...why waste it?"
5,"Excellent, a must listen!!!","Kingdom Come was much maligned and under appreciated. This is a great album that is chock full of killer songs all the way through, stand outs being ""Living Out of Touch, What Love can Be and Get it On"" among others. If you like bluesy rock, buy this. Whatever else you have heard about this band, it is great hard rock with excellent musicians."
3,Impressive.,"My wife really likes this monster. She is too intimidated to use it by herself.There is two mechanical parts to this, one is in the main shaft, and one is in the butterfly. The motor in the butterfly is very powerful. Positioned a little high, but very satisfying.The motor in the shaft broke on the second use. It sounds like there are plastic gears in it."
4,2 inch memory foam with pillows,"I was so excited to receive this product, this has really helped, I like to just spend time relaxing on our bed now that it is so comfortable..Great Product."
5,Great Product From All Sleep,"The mattress pad is awesome, and the price is even better. The customer service that All Sleep has is awesome.Order this or another product from All Sleep, they have the lowest prices for almost everything memory foam."
3,Restful Sleep Assistance,"I was disappointed in the beginning and the seller was very gracious with me.I must say, after time things got much better. Give things time and especiallyalways consult the seller first if unhappy with a purchase. Very pleased overall."
4,MUST READ FOR LOVERS OF EGYPTIAN ANTIQUITIES,"This wonderful book outlines the ancient Egyptian calendar which predates what we know as astrology. Fastinating insights into the religion, philosophy and everyday lives of an ancient people. The two authors, Wheeler and Pierce translated the papyri text to help modern readers use the calender on a daily basis much as you would as astrological chart. Solid, well written and utterly fascinating. I highly recommend it.Peggy Williams.....author of The Daisy Patch"
3,Very small wrist band,"Well, I thought this was a great present for my husband, but turns out it has a very small wrist band that is not adjustable. I appreciated the reasonable price and thought it would be great for outdoor time (hunting, etc). It simply did not fit. So despite the cool features, we sent it right back."
2,Didn't live up to it's reputation,"I purchased this camera 14 months ago - stepping up from my Kodak DC220. I wanted the extended zoom capacity - and unknowingly sacrificed quality and user ease. Exterior shots where lighting was ample, for the most part, are excellent - but as I do an extensive amount of interior shots for ""reporting"" purposes, this camera would not have a rated a ""one"". With my Kodak, the included written materials were outstanding as well as their on line information. With Sony - I presume they take it for granted that the buyer knows ""everything"". I feel bad that I encouraged someone else to purchase this camera, as they are now equally as unhappy (unaware that I was also displeased). I just purchased a the Nikon Coolpix775 - and have been so repeatedly and consistently impressed that I will upgrade next year. Both Kodak and Nikon cater to the consumer's needs by providing a quality product that can be enjoyed by both professional and amateur."
4,Publishing Photos ??,"Howdi, I got it couple of months ago and I must admit that it's great in terms of image resolution and quality. The like taking this camera to any concerts or shows and you have all the images on floppy..share it with people or publish on the net..just great. and on top it supports image stabilization just like my other Sony TRV87 and i can exchange batteries between them.The only thing which I don't like that much are the big size of this..due to 3-1/2 inch floppy and MPEG movie.. which is not very good in quality if you are moving the camera very fast and I don't even make many mpeg's out of this. Otherwise, it's so much fun using this and since I'm into photography, it let's me publish some photos online, quickly."
5,A very welcome book,"Speaking as a sufferer of chronic urticaria for ten years, I cannot recommend this book too highly for anyone with chronic hives, and their carers/family/doctors. While most doctors are familiar with acute hives, chronic hives are more difficult to diagnose and treat. Sufferers often go from doctor to doctor seeking answers, or try endless expensive ""alternative"" treatments to no avail. It is a miserable and frustrating condition, and for some, it can be life-threatening. The book has a unique workbook section for the sufferer to complete and take to their doctor, which I feel is a valuable and useful idea, and the book itself is full of factual information about urticaria. Every doctor should have it on their bookshelf, as far as I'm concerned. This book is very welcome and there are no others like it, to my knowledge. Highly recommended."
3,Authentic!,"I found this novel, set in cowboy country, to be very enjoyable--authentic and ""raw,"" with language the editor was smart enough to leave alone and not pretty up. It was riotously funny and moving, as well. Very good book in the western genre."
4,Definitely gets you closer,"I believe this barlow was released by Meade for use in the ETX-60 and -70, but it works in my EXT-90 EC.I first used it while observing the moon, which all of a sudden got a heck of a lot closer.The field of view changes a little when using the barlow, so that takes some getting used to. Also, I had to slightly adjust the focus after inserting the barlow -- in other words, you can't just sight in an object with a standard eyepiece, drop in the barlow, and then be in perfect focus. Not a big deal.I debated whether to get the 2x or 3x barlow. Perhaps naively I went for the higher power (""real"" astronomers advise against the abuse of power), but right now I just have the stock 26 mm eyepiece, so I don't think I exceeded my limit (with the barlow I get to 144x)."
5,Very pleasant surprise!,"After reading some of the other reviews, I wasn't sure if I should get the 2X or 3X Barlow for my ETX-60AT. Since they cost the same, I went for the higher power one and boy was that the right choice! With the included 9mm(39X) eyepice, I now get 117X magnification w/ the Barlow. It's like being right on the moon! (Well, not really, but closer nonetheless.) What's even more impressive is the fact that the image remains crisp and clear. And for those who complain about having to re-focus when using the Barlow, what planet are you on? When you change eyepieces, don't you re-focus then also? BTW, with the 25mm(14X) eyepiece and Barlow, you'll get 42X. Another way to get 117X is to buy the 6mm(58X) eyepiece along w/ the 2X Barlow. Of course w/ the 6mm, you're looking into an eyepiece 33% smaller than the 9mm. May be tough to see if you're wearing glasses too. I wonder if there's a Meade 4X Barlow??"
3,I don't use it much any more,"It works like it should (3x zoom) - of course it distorts the image, but you can see your image much bigger than without it."
2,meade short tube 3x barlow,"I have a short tube 2x barlow that works okay. The 3x short tube barlow has multiple internal reflections which cause the image to blur. I don't know enough about the optical design to say if this is intrinsic to the short tube design, but I think it is the reason that meade discontinued selling their 3x barlow."
3,So-so,"The lense works fine, however, you can get clearer images by just using a stronger eyepiece. If I were to do over again, I'd avoid the Barlow and buy a stronger eyepiece."
2,Good but not what I had hoped,"I got it very fast and in perfect and new condition! I was a little disapointed though with the light gathering of this lens. It does increase the power of whatever lense you are using but things look very dim as well. Not very good for viewing land objects but the moon looks great with this. I might try the 2x power next and see if I can't gather more light with that! Over all, not a bad product, just not as good as I had hoped!"
4,Great thing,If you want to see more than you want from your telescope this Lens is for you ... it makes you see at the bigger angle then any other ordinary lenses So get it to see more
4,If Brasilia were the capital of the world ....,"If Brasilia were the capital of the world, everybody would grow up knowing samba and how to dance to it.Alas, the world has not capital and Brasilia on the short list. So most of us need to be *taught* to dance samba. That's where this CD claims its usefulness. Each of eighteen tunes is worked out to 'strict tempo' samba in order to facilitate dancing by the novices, the newcomers, and the merely stiff.If you're new to this, I must warn you. Samba is contagious. But there are worse things to catch.If this kind of infectious rhythm doesn't seem like such a bad idea to you, start here."
5,For industrial R&D chemists,"Imagine you have many ""old-timers"" giving out practical tips each from years of experience. That is not often happening. This book does exactly that.It addresses process R&D; in pharmaceutical and / or fine chemicals industry, taking one from laboratory bench to pilot or production scale. The differences and difficulties in scale-up were clearly demonstrated and the solutions provided. It educates and helps a R&D; chemist or process chemist to ANTICIPATE, AVOID and OVERCOME the potential problems in process development and scale-up, at the START or EARLY stage of the project. Supported by many examples, the best practices and solutions are presented at the detailed technical level: routes, reagents, solvents, water, running and optimizing reactions, workup, chiral synthesis, etc.The author highlighted a lot of key advice in ""boxes"" and allows a quick one-hour read of the best points."
1,Poor Quality,"Ordered the three-pack. They are made of extremely cheap material, cut funny and like the other reviewer, split at the inseam the first time I wore them. I would not recommend these."
2,Not for activity,"""The Pants I ordered arrived in excellent time, but the quality...My husband wore the first pair, for an hour or so running around etc., and the pants ripped on the inseam, we thought it was maybe just the one pair, so he wore another, same thing, the size was fine but the pants kept ripping, quality maybe? I wouldn't recommend buying them unless you're just wearing them to lounge in."""
5,Best book on practical compass work,"This book is not a complete work on orienteering, but works great for people who really only want to know some basic skills to get them up and running. It is written in an easy to understand way. I also must have a newer version than the one that some of the reviewers are talking about as I have not seen any problems with misspelled words."
2,Idea not Unique,"This little book needs a re-write. It just does not flow, you have to read it a couple of times to understand what he is saying. Once you get his meaning you find out that this material is known by many experienced navigators, it is not a unique idea. My advice is, do not bank on just this method of wilderness navigation; or you will be in trouble.Investigate other navigation books because there are better ones.Ted FisherGeographic Information Systems DirectorVermilion County MIS"
1,Shameless Plug after Shameless PLug,"I just got this book from a surplus store yesterday.Impossible to read. LIke others said, the book does not flow, his typography is so horrible, if I need to look up at someone or answer my phone, I get lost. And then when I try to find my place, by skimming, I think I'm on the wrong page because nw I'm reading something about building a log cabin, or a log bench or something completely unrelated. So, I flip back a page, and start skimming, and I cant seem to figure out where I wax, I see where I went, but..oh wait.. there it is... CRAP thats not it... Shameless plug... WTH?The first thing you should always check for is the publisher. This guy is self published, and It shows. The images are pixelated, the writing sucks, the flow is off, the topics sporadic, ad at times, feel random.I know its kinda harsh to say, but dont waste your time and money. I'm going to the store to return this one tomorrow."
5,Moving tale of loss...and rediscovery!,"Carrinne Wilmington left home seventeen years ago. She left behind her family, the boy she loved. She left with a secret. Now she's back, determined to find an answer to the old question...who was her father? As she searches she discovers more than just that truth...she rediscovers a love that never really died. And is forced to admit some truths of her own.Anna DeStefano's first book is an amazing story of long buried hurts and of newfound understanding, of forgiveness and second-chances."
4,Flawed but still good,"For a first time author-this was admittedly a good book. The writer's writing style is smooth and entertaining. I do recommend this book, however, be prepared for a high unbelivable factor in the story. A Sheriff department who can obtain financial records of everyone close to or associated to the heroine without warrants is laughable, same goes for obtaining cell phone records. He didn't even know her cell number or her provider but presto he has the records faster than any city cop could get them. A small town hospital with surviellance cameras-not likely and I live and know of a lot of small Georgia towns. But when it comes to dealing with emotional angst and emotional tension-yeah the book is dead on. It's just the investigational stuff that kept jarring me out of the story."
1,THIS BOOK IS BAD!,"This book gave ZERO help. I bought it to give to my in-laws as a ""basic"" info book aobut OCD. i would have sent them screaming away if they ever had a chance to read it. It is all about the ""steps"" of AA (alcohol annon) and NOT about OCD.DONT BUY THIS! IT STINKS!(I will send you my copy free! Save your money!)"
1,shortlived coffee maker,"I purchased this coffeemaker for our school to use for large groups. It was used about 6 times and then it quit working. We were very careful to not immerse the pot in water, and one day it just quit working. I would not buy another pot by this company."
1,Like taking a dip in a vat of fragrance,"Unless you want your house, towels, and hands to reek of a sharp floral scent, stay away from this soap. I say this as a person who is not typically bothered by perfume, but this soap by Dove is loaded with scent which lingers for a long time. Total waste of money."
3,Smelly good.,I wore this when I was a young man. It is considerably cheaper now so I bought some for my young men to try. They seem to like it all right. I don't really care for it much any more. My tastes have changed. Have you smelled the new Gucci line? Nice.
2,"good look, bad quality","the medicine cabinet look nice, but the construction quality is bad at this price. the *PLASTIC* HINGE broken after a little bit over one year (which warranty just expired), and the size does not match those sold at Home depot/Lowe, I have to order online and cost me about ~ $12 (include shipping). what a disappointment."
5,"EXCELLENT!!! At least an ""8*** Star"" Book","Mary Balogh does it again. But then I shouldn't be surprised as she is one of my favorite authors.Julia Justiss is also one of my favorites as I have all of her books and have read all of them, most of which are on my Keeper Shelf.Now, last but not at all least is Nicola Cornick. I have all of her books and have read them too and they are all ""EXCELLENT"", but, I would advise you to read ""THE EARL'S PRIZE"", ""THE CHAPERON BRIDE"", and ""WAYWARD WIDOW"" before reading her story in this book, as Carla Davencourt and Sebastian Fleet have a history from the other three books. As Ms Cornick says in the beginning of the story....Can Carla Davencourt, who has loved Seb for years, open his heart to the comfort and joy of the Christmas season?She says this story is especially for all the readers who wrote to her after Seb first appeared in her books and asked when he would have a story--and a LOVE--of his own. SHE DID AND HE HAS IN SPADES!!!!!"
5,Most unexpected and Mysterious of all the Boxcar Children books,"Best Boxcar children book! Very mysterious since the Alden arrived at the plymouth hotel in New York, more and more mysterious pranks keep appearing as the book continues with more suspects to deal and investigate with. The ending was great, the thief was very unexpected."
5,Great Album,"Omar is one of my favorites. I have not heard one song from him that I did not like. This is a great Album, I love it!"
3,"A fine, rare history that can't be found elsewhere","The book gives information about the early impetus for translating God's Word into languages that previously had nothing written in them at all. The lives and very human events unfold in this book that show how gradually a vision was born that eventually led to over a thousand translations of the Bible that are underway today. These were ordinary men and women in one sense, but in another they were outstanding pioneers who were zealous to do what God wanted them to and to be used by Him to reach people who otherwise had no chance to hear of God in the language they could understand and which spoke to them intimately. The author does an excellent job of research and well documented reporting."
5,Excellent Movie,"This movie doesn't disappoint and is very true to the book without being over burdened with detail, so it's not important to have read the book before seeing it. Can't wait for the final one to be made into a movie."
3,The second film in the trilogy,"Girl who played with fireAs the rest of the world knows by now, the books known as the Millenium trilogy are fantastic and involve the great female heroine Lisbeth Salander. These are the Swedish film versions of the book,and this title is the second film of the trilogy. I loved the way Noomi Rapace has immersed in to the role of the feisty heroine completely and the film was decent. However in order to completely enjoy the film, please read the books beforehand. Three stars. 11/21/10P.S. I hear Hollywood is coming out with its film versions soon."
3,Not As Good As The Other Two,"Im not good with long reviews so heres mine for this movie in comparison with the other 2. I've recently watched ""The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets Nest"" so I rated this movie 3 stars because of that. The First movie was brilliant, We got an awesome mystery that seems like it's impossible to solve, a man who seeks the truth and justice, and a complicated and smart heroine with lots of secret. I was absorbed by the first movie because I knew nothing and it was like eating a candy with many flavors. Then ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" came out and I wasn't too excited about it. This movie continued where the first one left off and literally gave us everything we needed to know about Lisbeth's past and her family. The final one I was able to watch at our local film festival. I want you to want to watch it because the last movie is very exciting. This movie is actually the ""seed"" for the last movie. Mikael and Lisbeth will be at their best."
3,Let's Be Consistant,"I ordered this movie, because Part 2 of Disc 2, of my set of the Millenium Trilogy was corrupted, and unplayable. While I can't speak for the second half of the movie, the first half was edited differently from the version in the Trilogy set. Omitted were: the scene of Lizbeth and George walking on the beach in the Caribbean, at the beginning; the scene of Lizbeth saying Goodbye to George; and the scene of Lizbeth arranging for intensive therapy for Holgrem. Since these scenes were in the movie, why not include them in all versions of the film???"
4,The Girl Who Played With Fire (English dubbed),"The story was a little slow at times, but it told and acted very well. The movie kept the suspense high. Overall, I found the film very entertaining."
5,Fiery Review of Fire,"This engaging film benefitted from superb writing, excellent directing as well as editing. All the characters from main to supporting were totally believeable."
2,"WoW. Loved the ""Dragon"" but not this one.","Wow! Loved ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" but this one......(1)Voices used in English dub and really terrible. Flat, no emotional range, distracting. Why didn't someone spend a few extra dollars and get better voice actors?? (2) Some of the dialogue in the screenplay is just terrible. Even the actors didn't like some of the words they had to speak. Honestly, why didn't the director see or rather hear this?? (3) The plot is not audience involving. We are not given enough to let us engage in solving the mystery. We are simply spoon feed details as they unfold. Not good story telling. Overall, a real disappointment compared to the first of the 3. Sure hoping the 3rd is better than this train wreck. This is not recommended."
3,Not as good as the first movie,Not as good as the 1st - slow moving at times for a thriller & more predictable than the 1st. Still worth watching if you don't have to pay much.
3,Could have been better,"""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" is not as good of a film adaptation as ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" was. Although the acting is excellent, I was disappointed with the screenplay itself. So much material from the book was cut, and while I understand that not everything can be included in the movie version, I think the filmmakers cut too much in this case. Many details from the book were also changed for reasons I do not understand. Why deliberately change something if it has no impact on the movie plot? I was also disappointed with the way Erika Berger and Zala were portrayed in the movie...they are watered-down versions of their literary characters. Ultimately, I didn't think this film was nearly as powerful as the book, especially the ending. It was entertaining, but could have been a lot better."
4,can't keep and good girl down,I was very pleased that I had an option to watch this movie dubbed in English or subtitiles. I wish the first one also had that option.
3,The Trouble With Trilogies,"Sometimes the notion of a trilogy works, as let us say with The Lord of the Rings, and sometimes as here with the Girl trilogy it doesn't, at least this second segment doesn't. Partly it is because we already are familiar with the Lisbeth's bizarre and repulsive father back story from Dragon Tattoo, and partly because while all are sympathies lie with our fierce heroine, under all circumstances, the fact that there is a spatial separation between the two not resolved until the end (her and Mickeal,the detective/journalist) in this segment the bonding that made Dragon Tattoo so riveting gets lost in the shuffle. Hopefully part three will correct that imbalance."
5,This movie is Fire,I love ALL three of these movies...It keeps you on the edge....even though I can't speak the language..the sub-titles were very good ......when I can afford it...I will try to buy all three to keep....
3,girl who played with dubbing,"I am giving three stars because the movie itself deserves a full five, but the dubbing as it does with most films makes it pretty much unwatchable."
3,"Not nearly as good as ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""","Fairly good, however, but, the story is getting old .but, the story is getting old.but, the story is getting old.but, the story is getting old."
5,DVD - The girl who played with fire.,"An excellent story, well acted, and engrossing. The dvd was in its original plastic container and was not marred in any way. I received it rapidly and was not disappointed in any way."
2,Lacks spark,"After seeing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I found this film disappointing. I did not feel the same connection to the characters or between the characters."
3,"A slow start, but picked up at the end.","Not nearly the same interest keeping intrigue and surprising twists that ""The Girl WithThe Dragon Tattoo"" contained. If you had read the books proir to watching the movie, you could follow the plot, otherwise you often would be left in the dark."
5,"Great movie, even with dubbing","I've read the Dragon Tattoo trilogy and knew the characters and story line. Not sure someone who wouldn't have the same knowledge would have enjoyed it. Definitely should see (or read) Girl with the Dragon Tattoo before watching this. I think you'll be lost if you don't. Both the English and dubbed versions of Dragon have been released, so take your pick. And, the English version of this episode is soon to be released. I've been hooked on the entire story, so will probably watch the English one too."
5,i love it love it love it love it!,"I am so happy the sequel to the ""girl with the dragon tatoo"" was a lot different than the first movie. of coruse the movie picks up where it left off but lizbeth was a lot different in this movie. and their are more twists and turns to the plot! THey couple aren't together in this movie at all so it also has the feel of setting you up for the next movie. Oh man so good. I watched all 3 in one night because i could not stop watching ....so much action intrigue, suspense, and adventure, backed by love! Love the skills of everyon. well done"
3,I know I'm being too hard,"I liked this movie, but you can not fit an 18 hour book into a 2 hour movie and not lose the story. I really dont think a person who has not read the books can follow the movie. But it was well done and I did enjoy it."
1,I don't reccomend it,"there were no vocals, and the description stated that they used the same actors, which they clearly did not. I would have liked to have watch it either way, just thought that was odd. Love the series, was disappointed with the rental on movie 2 as a whole. hoping for a refund."
3,Not half as good as the first,If I had known it would be such an underwhelming movie I wouldn't have rented it.
2,"Long, Slow, and Boring","The movie did not live up to the write-up. So much potential, but they missed the mark. Too long and too boring. I'd guess that most of the high ratings for this film are from teenage boys that liked the numerous boob-shots and 30-second scene with two girls getting intimate. There are so many better action flicks out there. Maybe if this was less than 90 minutes it would have been OK, but even then only 3 stars at best."
2,Amatuer Night,"Amateur night. Too many scenes of characters explaining the plot to one another. Also, apparently in Sweden everyone coincidentally knows each other, and 2 out of 3 men are rapists. There are some redeeming qualities, but the plot relies again and again on coincidences. New characters appear from nowhere with no explanation (Lisbeth's ex-boss and her ex-gaurdian or whatever he was). A supposed criminal mastermind buries a body 5 feet from his house. A guy starts to torture someone for information, then just changes his mind. Weak."
2,Idiotic sequel to a decent movie,"The 90% of the plot does not make sense. The pictures and acting are still good though.There is some strange fixation on the Jews: in the first part Jewish women were helpless victims of the crime, in this one it seems important to highlight that the clueless police officer in charge of the investigation is Jewish too."
4,"An original and powerful detective, triller",Not as good as the first film in the series THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATOO but still very good. Great performce by the lead actress. Some seasons are terrifying but it does has the graphic violence of the first. Suspenseful with some humor. You'll cheer when she beats up 2 burly biker murders.Very good climax.Highly recommended
4,An integral part of the story,Dragon Tattoo is a very strong film; well done with a series of realistic events that work well together. Played with Fire has the feel of the second two hours of a six hour film. It has the feeling of a bridge between a strong start and what we hope is a strong finish. This is not to say that it is a bad film but the many coincidences are not completely believable. This is an enjoyable film but you do need to see Dragon Tattoo first.I have not read the books and cannot comment on how well they moved to the screen. I watched the English language version on the DVD not the subtitled version. This is an integral part of the story and worth seeing.
4,"If you're a fan of the book, then you'll love this movie","I think this movie is even better than movie version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"". If you loved the book, you will love this movie. It doesn't disappoint.The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because I think they could have added in a few more details from the book.Still a recommend."
3,Acceptable,"The second movie in Larsson's trilogy remains faithful to the book, but suffers greatly from a change in directors. It is also 23 minutes shorter than the first and those minutes should have been used to more fully develop the new characters and their connections in the story. As it stands, the movie is a little hard to follow unless you have already read the book."
2,girl who played with fire,The film content was OK but it would not play on any of my 3 DVD players. It would only play on my laptop and then only after I had modified the player to suit the type of format on the disc.
1,ugly film about ugly people,"Everything wrong with the European, civilized world--the substitution of political pretensiousness for anything resembling a good intelligence. Speaking critically, all of the films in this series are diffuse and poorly structured; I found that passing from scene to scene with my forward button removed nothing from the plot, which was thoroughly predictable."
2,Just another MTV flick,"I am a big movie fan, 1100 titles in my collection. And for the life of me, I cannot understand the hype about this series? The characters are ugly and dis-likeable. No one to sympathize with. The story line is beg, borrow or steal from all other thrillers. The raw sex thrown in on occasion to peak your prurient interest. Its just another MTV Flick. Man, Bergman must be turning over in his grave..."
3,Dubbed??,"Why is this dubbed?? I had to watch the non-HD version on netflix instead of the HD version on Amazon to avoid the dubbing. 5 stars for the movie, 1 star for the lack of a subtitled option = 3 stars for amazon's version of this."
3,Blah,"Nowhere close to being as good as the book, much like the original Dragon Tattoo movie. The Hollywood version of that one was so much better starring Daniel Craig. I hope they make this sequel, I'm sure it will be better. This one is more like a narration, doesn't quite capture the drama or the mindsets of the characters. It's over before you know it. Maybe worth watching once, but I would pass and wait for the Hollywood version."
4,"This is english subtitled, but not the first few mins",This is English subtitled. The previous movie had a dubbed version and one with original language with subtitles. The first few minutes s of this movie is in spoken English but the rest is subtitled English.
3,Mitcho's opinion,"I was pleased when I saw dubbed english. However the movie lost its dramatic feel with the dubbed voices,I am going to watch it again without the english, revert to original dialogue.I enjoyed the movie , not quite as much as the original.All up entertaining.I hope the next one follows the original. cheers Mitcho"
4,She's on the list,"Alien('s)(Ripley and the soldier), T2, Body Heat, you know the list. The tough broads. Hardcore kickass women. The kind you want when the going gets tough. Pioneer women. The Mexican woman in ""The Professionals"". Lisbeth is there. This is a great series. The books are great. The movies do as good a job as possible with the budgets given. Love it."
1,Really bad dubbing - watch the subtitled version instead,"I watched the other two films in this series in Swedish with English subtitles and enjoyed them. This version, available on Amazon Instant streaming, has the voices dubbed into English. It is really bad, unwatchable. Extremely distracting to watch a movie where the voices do not synch with the moving lips. Also, this is a Swedish movie, set in Sweden. Hearing the Swedish language is part of the experience. Whoever's idea it was to dub this into a kind of fake English with robotic voiceovers should change jobs."
3,The Extended Edition is sub-titled,"From the description, it's not possible to tell if the Extended Edition is dubbed or sub-titled. For your reference it's sub-titled.My rating is not on the movie, but the limited description."
2,Disappointing,"Maybe if you haven't read the book or seen the Hollywood version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo (the first novel) you'd like this Swedish adaptation of the second novel, but it is horribly lacking in the character development achieved in the book or the flash of a Hollywood movie production. It was actually rather boring."
5,3rd dragon tattoo movie,This is the Swedish version of the last dragon tattoo movie. The entire series is very well done. There were subtitles but it was easy to follow along. The acting is very good. I recommend this series.
4,DHolland,I really enjoyed the books by Stieg Larsson I was thrilled when the movies came out. I thought they did a very nice job on the movie however I felt that there were 3 or 4 key parts in the book that were not included in the movie. Hence the 4 stars.
3,The first half of the real second book,I always felt the book was part one of a two-parter. The second movie continues to show some of the interesting sides of Swedish life and a fiercely independent young female. The character/story development is a little slow as it was in the book. I will buy the third DVD when it is available inspite of the poor reviews the film is getting and hope that Scott Rudin does a better job when the U.S. versions appear.
1,Wait for a remake starring Rooney Mara!,The trilogy is a great story with vast potential. I ruined the experience by first watching the 2011 version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo staring Rooney Mara. After seeing Rooney's world class performance as the star 'Lisbeth' these original videos are very lack luster. Until Rooney stars in a new adaptation of the last two movies you should stick with the book.
2,What a letdown!,"Massively disappointing follow up to the wonderful Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Whilst our hero here (once again played to perfection by Noomi Rapace) takes centre stage, her actions are less dramatic and dark than the first and she is thrust headlong into a convoluted and weak plot surrounding her past and the events of the first film. Everything here has a tv movie of the week vibe and is let down immensely by an ending which blasts credibility clean out of the park with its sheer stupidity. If you think the blonde guy from Die Hard coming back at the end of the film after being hung is stretching things wait till you get a load of this!!!!! Lets sincerely hope the next film sets things back on track again."
1,do not buy this dvd,This dvd is formatted for european sets and will not show on most US dvd's.Richard Chernick
1,Read the book before you watch this movie...Tattoo was much better,"I read the book before I watched the movie and was thoroughly dissatisfied with the movie. I did the same thing with ...""Dragon Tattoo"", and loved the movie! I might be too late but I'm hoping they will bring back the Director who did Tattoo for the third movie."
1,pirated copy for prime viewers?,"I had to quit listening to the streaming video because of the background noises of traffic and what sounded like exotic birds in an apartment, to the extent that I couldn't hear the actors very well. I wonder if Amazon is using a pirated copy of the film, and if so, why? Otherwise, what explains those loud noises that are clearly not part of the action? I didn't see any birds in the film! It's not a great way to lure Prime customers in. I plan to discontinue my free trial soon."
2,Horrible unrelenting violence,"I really hate what was done with this movie. The brutal violence and sadism is so unrelenting that it's impossible to follow the story line. I have not read the books, and so I had no idea of when and where it would occur. I had to turn it off, fast forward, or walk away from the computer screen during those scenes, which meant I lost about half the movie and most of my understanding of the film. The first film was also difficult to watch...impossible in some scenes, but at least I could get follow the plot. Whoever wrote the screenplay and directed this movie should have considered the suspense and intriguing storyline more that slamming people with the horror."
2,Disappointing...,"I loved the first movie, Girl with the Tatoo. I saw it without reading the book and found it easy to follow. That's when I decided to read the Girl Who Played With Fire. I wanted to learn more of the details about Lisbeth Salanders upbringing. The book was hard to put down. Fast paced with intricate details of the many important characters and events that all diverged in the end. Because I loved the book, I was anxious to see the movie. The movie was a disappointment. So much was left out, that I think if I hadn't read the book I would've been lost. It was fast paced, but almost too fast, without much character/background depth. Characters seemed to come out of nowhere and things transpired without much explanation.If you've read the book, I wouldn't recommend watching the movie. Otherwise, you might enjoy the movie because you won't know what you're missing."
1,Disenchanted fan of the books,"Following the great enactment of the The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I had much higher expectations for this installment of the trilogy. Unfortunately having read the books, I find that the treatment given the material was highly superficial and barely following the plot of the excellent material it is based on. The complexity of the plot in the book is not present in the movie, maybe because the producers and the director wanted to follow up on the success of the first movie they shortchanged the readers who would be the principal viewers of the films.I am saddened that such a rich and enveloping story line was given such a nonchalant treatment to the point that it barely resembled the story line. I hope that if they do a movie version of the third book, they go back to the formula for the first movie, wherein, although not entirely faithful to the book it was a better treatment of the novel's plot and story line."
1,This movie sucks!,This movie is the equivlant of track 27 on a CD. Relied on the fruits of the first movie - Girl with the Dragon Tatto to get me to view. Worst movie of 2011 and their were alot of stinkers this year. Save yourself two hours and select something else. Would have given no stars but not an option.
3,Dragon Tattoo was much better...,"We loved ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"", the first in this trilogy. This film, the second, seemed more like your average crime-drama TV show. The story lacked the sense of intimacy and connection with the characters that you had in the first -- it was somehow distancing and sterile. There were parts that seemed entirely unrealistic, and the characters somehow ""stock"", despite their patina of originality. You could see the turns of event coming a mile away -- overall rather a disappointment."
2,"English Dubbing is horrible, couldn't finish watching","The English dubbed version of this movie is terrible! It doesn't even sound like the voice over people are *trying* act. It came off as incredibly cheesy and I found it incredibly distracting. It took me three days to get halfway through the movie and finally, after giving it a go the third time, I just had to stop.I'd much rather hear the actual actors voices - even if it's not in my native tongue. I can still feel their emotions and hear the real tone. I'd rather read the subtitles than experience this horrible dubbing."
3,Glad I Read The Book First,"Although no Academy Award awaits, the movie was fair. Glad I read the book first or not sure if I'd be able to follow along. Also, it was a fairly long movie."
5,A very good job of presenting a complicated book.,Loved Noomi and the way she captured the character. Can't imagine an American movie version or an American actress to compare in her performance.
4,Two stories for the price of one,I find this story of the trilogy oops did i just type trilogy.brings back memories of Frodo. Intelligent storytelling with emotion. When you make it through this movie be sure to listen to the final song in the credits. Your soul will dance with delight as i think the song is the movie. And if your soul doesn't dance............ well
5,Good Flick,I enjoyed this because I had read the trilogy...the movie is not nearly as good as the book but I am glad to have it in my video library.
1,RUBBISH TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"Stieg Larssons' series is pure amoral insanity straight from hell itself. It has no head or tail, all of it is unbelievable rubbish at the highest level. If this is the ""best"" that Swedes can come up with, then I'll think twice before I pay their country a visit. Don't bother, don't waste your precious time as TIME IS MONEY, and this would definitely be the worst investment of it, EVER! Plus God will be very angry with you..."
4,What are we missing?,"'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' has a Run Time of 152 minutes,and 'The Girl Who Played With Fire' 129 minutes.In Sweden,all three films have been issued on DVD,and Blu-Ray,with a Run Time of 186 minutes.Do Studios/Distributors think viewers have limited attention spans that so much of a film should be edited out?"
2,The Girl Who Played With Mediocrity,"Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist return for more violent mayhem, but ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" (2010) is painfully formulaic - plagued by an underwhelming narrative and Daniel Alfredson's flat direction. The second cinematic installment of Stieg Larsson's ""Millennium"" series runs 20 minutes shorter than ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" (2009) yet feels longer. Memorable portrayals by Noomi Rapace and Michael Nyqvist cannot redeem this lackluster Swedish thriller. A major letdown compared to the brilliance of ""Dragon Tattoo."""
2,the girl who played with fire,Film would be unintelligible to someone who had not read the book. For those who have read the trilogy it is well done. Rapace is a great actress well cast for the part.
4,"Fart Blooper in ""girl who played with fire""","Am I the only one who noticed the ""FART"" in the movie? Its in the beginning of the movie after Lisbeth makes love to her girlfriend. After her girlfriend gives her the cigarette holder gift....the girlfriend moves a little bit then farts...they immediately cut to the next scene but Lisbeth had a smirk on her face. I rewinded it like 3x to make sure it was a fart and it definitely was....LOL!!!!!!"
3,So-so,"I'm looking forward to see where this film ends up, having been thoroughly engrossed in the first film and now just keeping pace in the second installment. I thought there were moments where the film could be more tense and exciting and it was more along the lines of ho-hum."
2,Good movie if you need to sleep,"Honestly, I attempted to watch this movie no less than THREE times and every single time, I fell asleep. Knowing that I watch a lot of movies and normally don't fall asleep, clearly it was tedious a boring which is why I could not stay awake."
3,Part of a series to read,"OK, but not as good as the first book. Not a great movie either, but books are most likely better anyway."
5,Deep and true to the book,"I read the book in 14 hours.Next hour, I watched the movie. This is as true as it gets, and the actors deliver. They are so similar to what the book has penned their characters and their behaviors. The lead character has done an amazing job. So great, that some scenes are difficult to watch because she's brought the torture to life. Go see it, but read the book before you do. You'll have more respect for the actors and the director. It was so perfect that I can't bring myself to watch the hollywood version."
2,Nothing like the book!,"They cover too much territory too fast, not enough character development and I don't think they knew where to take the movie."
3,Good for the price,"I can't argue with the quality of this ring for the price. I feel like it is worth exactly what I paid for it. The stones seemed a lot smaller than in the picture, but that may be because I ordered the size 11, so compared to the width of the ring, the stones seemed kind of small. The stones are not as deep purple as in the picture, the ones I got are more lavender. Also, the stones are mounted a lot flatter than they look in the picture. It is still a pretty ring for the price, but it is definitely a cheaper ring."
2,Very cute but blue color faded & discolored,"I love this shirt's softness, but the blue color faded almost instantly and became discolored in bleachy pink spots, relegating it to pajama-only status."
4,Cute giraffe! Hard ears.,"I love our Schleich animals. They are well made, and so fun for pretend play or for just holding in the hand to play. I think my kids will get many years of play out of them (currently age 4 and 18 months), so i feel they are worth the somewhat hefty price tag,although i do wish they were cheaper. This giraffe is cute and looks great. One really minor thing is that the giraffes ears are really hard and pointy. Not at all too sharp for regular play, but sometimes when we have a big jumble of toys on the floor, i make sure to move the giraffe out of the way so that the kids dont hurt their feet by stepping on it barefoot, or get poked while rolling onto it."
2,not the usual Schleich quality,"I have quite a few Schleich toys, and I've always been happy with them. So much better than other companies, always life like and durable. But I'm not happy with this giraffe. The paint job does not look realistic. There are many spots where it looks like someone was trying to make corrections to the paint - just horrible. Almost as if they had given a marker to a child and said, 'here, draw in some lines'What I find most confusing is the fact that all the Schleich toys I've purchased in the US are made in China. Schleich is a German company and all the toys I've bought in Germany are actually made there. So maybe it's the ones made in China that have more flaws, but then again, I'm very happy with my tiger, elephant and camel - all made in China. So I'm not sure what happened to this Giraffe, which I did buy as 'brand-new'"
5,One for our safari,Authentic looking and a great piece to add to my sons other animal collection. Very durable.Creates a good imagination when playing with toys like this.
5,It drives like a new car,"I should of got these struts bout 6 mounts ago when it was warmer. any how, this was the cheapest place I could find these struts (about $30.00 cheapr then any place else) and they fit perfect. Thanks and keep up the good work."
3,soothing deep,"Into the deep is a nice soothing film with a gentle score. The opening sequence of the Califonian kelps is breathtaking. The rest of the film comprises a wide range of colourful species, a damaged shark, fish, squid, crabs, seals and more fish. The film moves at a slow pace and you do feel like skipping a few scenes to more action-oreintated sequemces. But it never happens, and the film just sildes gradually from one species to another. The music and the tender feminine voiceover might make you go to sleep half way through. It's that soothing! Also, some of you might find it uninvolving mid-way through because of the slow -pace, and the music. Overall, a nice film for those who like to chill and observe the beauty of underwater life, with gentle music and a cute voiceover."
2,Like a runway model...,"...this DVD may be beautiful, but it is utterly lacking in substance. With not nearly enough meat to warrant a DVD, Into the Deep runs like a long teaser for a much more in-depth and expansive exploration of underwater life, deep sea exploration, particular species of sea life...just about anything except what you might see in your first scuba lesson, if you were lucky enough to go on that lesson in these particular California depths. Leave this one on the proverbial shelf."
2,Dissapointingly short,"This is really a short DVD. I was expecting much more. It's not even the 35 minutes they claim it has. It's only 32 min on my player. Not that three minutes make a big difference, but the overall content is not so great either. However, the picture quality is excellent and the scenery is superb, this I must admit. The other dissapointing thing is the ""Special Features"" section. The only special feature they show is a theatrical trailer to other IMAX films (about 3 minutes in length.........)Go figure!!! Ocean Oasis, on the contrary is a superb production with excellent ""Special Bonuses"". Don't buy ""Into the Deep"", if you're hesitating. It's not worth the high price."
5,The Perfect Solution,I leave my car at the airport for weeks on end. With this product no more dead battery.
2,Awful..Smut,"The decision to throw Soltan Gris in prison in vol. 7 and remove him as narrator is really hard to defend. There's nothing that couldn't have been done better with Gris still running around the Confederacy wreaking havoc. Monte Pennwell was an atrocious idea. I suspect Hubbard died before the series was finished with someone else finishing it off, assuming the Pennwell identity to mask a different writing style. (Else Hubbard is truly a master of voice..since most writers carry their writing tone in everything they write)Skip over the chapters involving Teenie, unless you're a undersexed teenager. Awful, awful stuff. Base two books around the worst characters (Teenie and Madison) in the series? What were they thinking?"
1,Pornography poorly done,"Hubbard's writing is so poor that reading these volumes take more and more will power than, I hope, most readers will have. The sexual content is also getting more and more pornographic . . . if you want to read a good science fiction book ( and none of the Mission Earth books could be called good science fiction) then try Robert A. Heinlein's uncut ""Stranger in a Strange Land."""
4,A Good Story,"This is certainly a great story about frindship. I enjoyed itvery much, but it kind of dropped at the ending."
3,Not exactly on the Block,"Over all this is a great story, although one cant help but get the feeling that she lost interest at some point in this book, not unlike one of the main characters, and wrapped it up quickly and in some ways let it fall short of what I feel the story could have achieved. On the whole this story is slightly darker then her former works, though it still drives home a nice point about love and friendship. if you're already at Weetzie kid I recommend it, however if you're just getting into Block's writing I recommend starting with something else."
2,So-so and a little disturbing,"I didn't like the tone of this book. I've read books about sex, drug use and similar stuff, but this book had a creepy, dark feel to it. The girls' friendship throughout the book wasn't even a redeeming quality. Though the words may be poetic, the storyline shows bad taste and poor morals."
5,applause,"this is a tremendous novel full of real facts, full of things that happen and the ways to deal with them. i fully applaud it."
2,"after finishing this book, i don't know if i like it","i like to step away after completing a book having learned something about myself or felt something i hadn't before. this book was certainly interesting but i did not find it riveting or something worth reading again. i didn't step away with something new inside of me. it was a bit cryptic, and i like deep meanings, but i just couldn't grasp what on earth the author was trying to convey. the book is full of interesting insight and references to the supernatural...but, being a skeptic, i don't relate to this. however, i finished the book, which surprised me. it is short and decidedly artsy."
4,Violet and Claire,"Violet and Claire was an interesting novel with all of Block's creative flair. The girls confide in each other, even though the world around them is spinning, changing, and cruel. Violet and Claire save each other and help themselves become stronger.I liked this book because each girl softened the other's world, and even just for a second, making the cruel real world seem safer."
2,Block falls short,"I wish that there were a way to give this book two different ratings. I find that Block is an excellent description writer, so if you are looking to add more color and light to your writing I would recommend reading and studying her work, because I'm sure it would help. However, Block falls short in creating a solid story, she does not establish things well, including the girls friendship, from which the entire novel is based. Throughout the novel you are hopping from place to place wondering how it got to this place and that. As I was looking at other reviews for her various books I noticed some similar to mine, and those that rated her highly were simply relating to or wanting to be like one of the characters. I found that this book lacked substance and unless you are a diehard Block fan I would not recommend getting it."
3,Not as magical as the Weetzie Bat books...,"I am a big fan of Francesca Lia Block, so I was thrilled to get an advance of this book. Unfortunately, it did not live up to my (admittedly very high) expectations. The story drags at points, the characters aren't as intriguing as her previous characters have been, and the pop culture references at times drag the story down. Nice use of Tori Amos lyrics though. I wish I liked this one more. (I'm also older than the intended audience, which may have something to do with it. Someone younger may like it more than I did.)"
1,A bad moral book,"This book is very bad and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody! It has all kinds of gross things like bad thoughts, bad motives, sex, and more. The girls are basically sleeping their way into getting a movie. I started reading it because I got it for my birthday, but stopped halfway through because it was so horrible. I threw it in the trash, because that's what it is."
3,Review of Violet and Claire,"Set against the backdrop of Los Angeles, Block creates yet another dynamic story about young adolescents in their journey from innocence to experience and back again. The imagery is fascinating and I would venture to say that much of Block's appeal lies in her talent for creating interesting descriptions and unique characters. I was very pleased with this book and inhaled it once I opened it. I met Violet the young filmmaker finding herself caught in the web of the Hollywood scene and her muse, Claire, the pixie girl. This book allows you to see the world through each of the girl's eyes, through the camera lens of Violet, and the poetic eyes of Claire. Though this book follows a specific formula that can be found in other Block books (I won't spoil this review by defining that formula), I found it to be extremely interesting and wonderfully depicted."
1,What a waste!,"Buying this book is like throwing away your money. It has no plot and the characters are not likable. they are stupid persons. It's as if Block tries to hard to write about ""cool"" stuff, like Tori Amos songs and it all ends up sounding false. I hated both Violet and Claire. Don't buy this book please!"
4,"Brief, predictable, but some interesting imagery","The brevity bothered me a bit, and a bit of the predictability, but it was engaging in the difference of the way it was written. Based on two girls, the first section is written by Violet, in first person, but with camera cues. The second section is written by Claire, in the form of a journal, again in first person, while the story concludes with a third-person look at Violet & Claire. It explores friendship, ambitions, attaining dreams and falling from them and relationships, though I suppose I would have wished a bit more development. Claire's fascination with the faerie and how she relates to them (ostracized from the developing human world) is a nice touch of fantasy and ethereal thinking, whereas Violet sees the world as a story."
1,Not an enjoyable experience,"I have been a rabid fan of Ms. Block since Weetzie Bat, and I have gobbled up all of her books. My first bad taste came with I Was A Teenage Fairy, which I won't even begin to discuss. Now, with Violet and Claire, I am growing anxious about the change in Ms. Block's work. Her characters are spoiled and unlikable. Her writing has not grown better over time, rather it has gotten old and stale. She needs to try new and more unusual (and more charming) subjects and styles. If her next book continues on this less-than-exciting path, I will just have to be content with Weetzie Bat and accept that the magic is fading."
2,This is a terrible book (but it gets 2 stars for Tori Amos),"I saw this book displayed at my school library. Immediately, Ithought it would be interesting. I read the little description and itsounded perfect for me. Contrasts of dark and light, movies, poetry, etc. The basic plot outline had so much promise. The author's problem though, is that she never really delves into any of it. She just mentions it, never truly describing it. The book overall lacks feeling and personality. In the end, you don't really feel like you got to know the characters or sympathize with them. They seem somewhat annoying. The way she writes the book, it almost seems claustrophobic. She piles on meaningless words. It's all words and no imagery. What I did liked was the poetry and Claire's descriptions but that's not enough to save this book. Overall I do not think that you should read it but if you still want to, at least borrow it-don't buy it."
4,Mystical and Delightful,"Ms. Block takes you down a road of friendship between two very different girls. It is narrated by both of them. I have read most of Ms. Block's work and this book definately shows her talent. Like in most her books and stories this is set in the wonderful, but grim city of Los Angeles. This book has you fall in love with these two unique best friends. If you like modern fiction then you will greatly enjoy this novel."
4,unique & poetic,"This was one of the last Block books I read because I thought it had a stupid cover, however once I started reading it, Violet & Claire drew me in with the screenplay format (not the whole book) and didn't Violet say she liked Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast? Yes, I thought Claire was a cool character--she has wings!!--and it was a fun book to read, with Block's poetic writing. It did have some sex and drugs in it, which for me is a bummer about reading Block's books, and it's won't go down in history as a great book, but it could go in your bookshelf as one."
1,Oowww....,"I loved her previous books, although I thought with ""I was a Teenage Fairy"" she was moving onto thin ice. Alas, with ""Violet & Clare"" I think the ice is cracking beneath her feet. I was barely able to finish the book, despite its shortness. The plot was boiled, the characters leaden and while Violet and Clare certainly represented the banality of the angst ridden teenager, I don't think that is exactly what Miss Block had in mind. I was so disappointed that I considered returning the book half-read, first time I've ever contemplated such. : < I managed to muster on to the end, but most of the plot has already flown from my mind. All that remains is a sense of disappointment and the feeling that perhaps she needs to write, for once, about girls who are not thin. Also, it might have have just been me, but the Lolita-like cover photo didn't do much for me either."
5,"Wonderful, challenging book!","My Bible study has been working our way through this book for 17 weeks now, and our lives have been changed. We have been so challenged by this book. It is not for the casual study of the Bible, but an in-depth look at I & II Peter, verse by verse. If you want to take a closer look at the life of Peter and what he had to say to us, this book is worth the wait to get it.Sara Smith"
5,My favorite find of 2001,My husband and I listened to this CD obsessively after seeing her in concert in Manchester England last year. Hopefully she will tour US soon because she is not to be missed live.
1,Does not work with Kindle Fire,"This device does NOT WORK. Spend a bit more and get the true replacement. I wasted my money, don't waste yours."
2,takes almost 15 hours to charge,"product arrived on time and as described, but this is a very low power (read: slow) charger. it took almost 15 hours to fully charge my kindle. maybe ok for other smaller devices like phones. For the kindle you' re better off buying the amazon quick charger, even though it's so expensive"
5,Kindle fire charger replacement,Has an indicator light on the unit which is on when plugged into the wall. More compact that the original unit which came with my Kindle Fire. All in all a great value for replacing the Kindle Fire charger
4,Decent replacement,"This Boxwave USB Wall Charger I purchased recently through Amazon works well. We lost the original one that came with our new Kindle Fire. It does seem to charge a bit slower than the original one, but the most important thing is it does recharge the unit in a reasonable amount of time, and did not seem to get too hot..."
1,Save your money,Does not work. Wanted an extra charger for my Kindle and plug in and just doesnt charge. One star because it was shipped right out but would have given the charger no stars
2,Kindle Fire battery charger,This charger is good for travel if you have alot of time to charge your Kindle Fire....for example...my Kindle will charge from empty to full in about 2 hrs max and this charger takes about 24 plus hrs to fully charge the unit. I probably will not use it again.
2,Returned Item,I honestly don't know if it was good or not. Had issues with new Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and had to return that too so don't really know how effective this charger was. I replaced it with a Belkin which works VERY well on my Kindle Fire Replacement.
3,SO WHATS IN THE MANUSCRIPT?????,"This book makes a good point about life and being careful about the choices you make. I would have given it a higher rating but the beginning of the book starts with Onie recieving a manuscript that Kayla (her dads ""girlfriend"")left her 15 years ago. I read the book cover to cover and I stll don't know what the hell Onie read!?? It wasn't the content of the book because of the point of view that the book was written in! Had that small detail been left out, I would haven given this book 5 stars!! But not knowing what Kayla left her, left me in the dark. Take my advice and just start with chapter 1 and you'll love it."
4,Nice Fan,"It's a nice fan. The red is like a thick silk and the black slats are plastic. It was a little larger than I had hoped for, maybe about a foot long. I actually use mine all the time so I have had to repair the slats on the ends. It's very easy to open and close though."
4,Perfect,"These were just what I was looking for. Thanks! Will be back for other colors. Snap properly, seem sturdy, and beautiful full size."
2,Cheaply made,"This t-shirt was a Christmas gift for my nephew. Although he is eight and loved it because it's a Mavericks' shirt, I was really disappointed with how thin the shirt was and how dingy and cheap the quality seemed. It looked fine, but it felt like it was from a Dollar Store or something. Pretty disappointing for the cost."
4,fun,"this is a great book, for younger readers. It is filled with colorful pictures, that will keep kids interested for hours. The characters are cute, and the plot is funny. Overall, This is an enjoyable book."
1,This looks nothing like it does in person!,"I ordered this from Amazon.com thinking it was a green and red recipe box(As shown in the above picture) which would go wonderfully with my kitchen. I recieved it yesterday and to my horror it is peach, yellow and BROWN! It couldn't be any uglier. Someone needs to take a new picture of this box and put it on there because it looks NOTHING like that! I will be sending it back today..........."
5,recipe box perfect,"the recipe box arrived in time for christmas, just like it was pictured. my daughter loved it! i'm thinking about getting myself one."
4,"Colors are funky, but I like it","I got this item as a christmas gift, and though the colors are not as pictured, I really like it. The box is made out of a sturdy tin and the cards are thick and well made. I like how it comes with 50 recipes, 7 tabs, and 50 blanks ones. The cards are a good size for recipes. If you're not real picky about the colors, this item is great for the price."
4,Cute :),"This box is cute and it does exactly what I wanted it to do - it stores my recipes in a box that I'm not afraid to leave out on my countertop. I'm not one of those people who really cares what color the box comes in - does it really matter if it's peach-colored instead of orange, etc?!?! I haven't tried any of the recipes that come in the box, though I've looked through them and they look easy enough. I like the extra cards that came with it because they have extra lines on the back for longer recipes."
5,(...) book review of 'The Hobbit',"This is a wonderful and exciting book. It was written by J.R.Tolkien. The main characters in this book is Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf Grey, and the twelve dwarves. The fourteen creatures go on a treasure hunt to get their gold back from an evil dragon. I reccommend this book because it's exciting and very unpredictable. Also many fantasy authors have read this book to get an idea on what to write. This book us the first fantasy epic and is loved by many readers."
5,Best book on the eightfold path!,"The eightfold path is at the root of Buddhism. And this book is my go to guide for the eightfold path. I've read many descriptions of the eightfold path over the years, but none of them has come close to Jean Smiths work. Each of the eight steps has it's own chapter, and she does a beautiful job of explaining each one. This book has become a cherished reference book in my personal library. I've owned it for over eight years, and every time I feel the urge to review one of the steps on the path I pull out this beautiful book. Needless to say. my copy is pretty beat up and dog~eared. As soon as I can afford it I'm going to buy one for my Kindle so I can have it with me all the time. I know this review sounds over the top, but I mean it sincerely."
5,Living the Buddha's Eightfold Path begins with the first step,"Dear Fellow Reader and Searcher, This book has it all: A well-organized table of contents, comprehensive index, and many citations from the Buddha's discourses. Plus it has a glossary of terms. Though I am sixty years plus, I am still a beginner, and this book provides lots of support and clarification. At times, it seems like the author, Jean Smith, has anticipated a beginner's questions. Her answers help a lot.May Jean and You find liberation in this lifetime."
2,"Well, it would have been a 2 1/2!","This is no ""Purpose Drive Youth Ministry"" by Doug Fields nor is it a ""Student Ministry for the 21st Century"" by Bo Boshers! It is however a snapshot of tidbits of information that may come in handy if you need a paragraph or two on a certain subject like sponsors, or zits, or depression. You can not read it all the way through, but you can use it as a reference tool. Is it a must have? Only if you are not looking for deep studies. It is too thin to even begin to explore half of the subjects indepth. It has a great reference section (probably the best part of the book). There are better books that you should spend your money on, like the two mentioned above, but it is good at wetting your appetite on the subjects it attempts to approach."
2,Very Iffy,"Be careful with this book. I read the part about advertising, and it's telling you not to let your events be too known because it might scare the Teens off. So, then a more suitable method is....teaching them to be ashamed of the Gospel? As anyone in Youth Ministry knows, Purpose Driven Youth MInistry is the all out best book on the market at this time, but it's major strength is in not focusing too little on too much. In comparison, this book gives tidbits of ideas over a large number of topics in a book no thicker than a magazine. I used to work in a Christian bookstore where we sold it, and I couldn't stand to look at it for more than 2 or 3 minutes"
4,A well researched book,"I think Stout has done a great job in covering the missions to attack the Romanian oil fields at Ploesti. It is well researched and gives a good insight into reasons certain tactics were used, and also gives good first hand accounts of the action. His knowledge of the subject and his understanding of the practicalities of the fluid nature of air combat from his flying background make this a sound work.I would have given it five stars apart from the fact I found the book a little disjointed at times. I would have liked a little more structure from an editing standpoint."
4,72 y o female response,Very hard to read and much technical stuff that I did not understand as I am not an air plane person nor military.
4,Pianos are cool,"All the best elements of Five for Fighting, Keane and Jacks Manequin meet to form Melee. Melee is able to have a piano take solos unlike most bands today. The bonus cover of You Make My Dreams Come True rivals the original. It's fun and reintroduces a classic 80's without going the way of punking it up. The lead song Built To Last is what you want to hear someone say to you. ""Frequently Baby"" makes you want to dance. This is a great CD to listen to at work and in the car during those stressful moments. Highly recommend to those looking for truly talented musicians."
4,Melee Rocks,"Melee is a band that manages to satisfy my craving for piano and guitar at the same time. Their album Devils and Angels, has some great tracks. Can't Hold On is my absolute favorite. Biggest Mistake cracked me up. You gotta love an album, that can make you cry and laugh. These guys seriously rock."
4,Muito Bom!,A Banda Melee faz um rock alternativo de qualidade. Vale a pena comprar este cd!!! Muito Bom!!!
2,Devils and Angels....hmmm ok.,"I got this CD with no expectations at all. I was hoping that at least one song would reach out to me. However, nothing came. I was really bored by the album and after listening to it once, put it aside. I did pull it out again to listen to see if any songs got me tapping a foot, but again nothing.I'm sure these are some really talented guys, but this album was just BLAH to me. No offense."
4,I like it.,"I have no complaints with this product; it is what it is...a small DVD player for 39 bucks. Serves my purposes well. Note: It DOES have an ""off"" button and if u read the manual it tells you where it is; u hold the play button in for 3 seconds."
2,No user replaceable battery!,"This unit worked well enough for about 6 months. Then the battery stopped holding a charge long enough to get through even one movie. After cycling the battery a few times, I started hunting for a replacement battery. Good luck!"
5,Buying my second one,"Where would I be without my little DVD player? I've had it for two years and I use it every day. I don't own a TV because commercials and junk shows drive me crazy. I buy seasons and rent movies and this player is my entertainment center. I lay in bed with earphones and watch shows so I don't disturb my husband. The sound with earphones is great - better than without. It's been abused and it keeps on playing. Now after two years it is freezing a little - but a flick of the finger starts it right up. So now the old one will go to work to help get through a very slow retail slump for my employees when work is done and I keep the new one for me! To the person who said there is no stop button - there is. It's the middle one. Press to play and press to stop. It has rewind and FF, too."
1,Junk.,"My parents bought this for me for Xmas.The first one never worked, just turned on and made horrible screeching noise.They sent a replacement (Radioshack wouldn't take it back on the 31st day).The replacement is noisy and skips. There is no ""stop"" button.It is not easy to use. It is horrible all around, and I can figure tech things out pretty easily."
2,Incredibly bad transfer,"I could not watch enough of this to make an assessment of the quality of the documentary. I am prepared to believe it might be fine, in an extremely gritty home-made VCR kind of way.But the video quality was just horrible. Granted, they shipped me a used copy that looked like it had substituted for a hockey puck for a few seasons -- without flagging it as a poor copy in Amazon (shame, shame).But generally with digital media you either get the complete image or you get nothing, or severely pixelated or scrambled pixel images. In contrast to that, the kind of horrifically bad video / audio I observed was the type you get from VCR tapes in general, and specifically from ones that have been reused way too many times, then stored near some source of EM radiation (like any cord or cable that carries much current), or else are copies of copies of copies of copies.Suggest you avoid this one. I returned it."
5,Transformed,"I was given the I Can Do It! page-a-day desk calendar for Christmas in 2002. This calendar helped heal alot of dysfunctional attitudes and thoughts. I have since been searching for another one. I would like to start over again. I took each thought with me each day I left for work and the healing ability within it helped transform a negative outlook on life to someone who enjoys getting up each day and looks forward to new challeges! Thank you and please put it back in print.CindiLincolnton, NC"
1,WORST PRODUCT EVER!!!,"This is the WORST product ever It was psychologically irresponsible and emotionally scarring. It presents an entirely egocentric and narcissistic view of reality. The ideas, carried to their logical conclusions absolutely prevent meaningful interaction with other humans. There is not a shred of psychologically sound information. If you really want to mess up your life, buy this. For example, ""I am filled with a strong sense of worth and I increase my ability to attract abundance into my life."" - Excerpt from January 24, 2003. What could that possibly mean? It is barely even coherent and lacks any substance. However, if you are interested in a good, hearty laugh, by all means indulge yourself with this product. Just remember, not to listen to anything it says."
2,Save your money and don't bother with this item,"Although you will save money when purchasing this Nectron cartridge as opposed to the original Epson cartridges, the amount of ink you will waste cleaning clogged heads as well as the wasted photo paper will more than negate the savings. These cartridges are extremely unreliable!"
5,Cedarmont Kids - Toddler Tunes,Got the dvd quick and disc was not loose in the box. My granddaughter loves it!
2,A disappointment,"I was excited by the song list, but disappointed by the video. Most videos these days try to have a mix of child performers from different racial backgrounds. With limited exceptions, the main performers on this tape are stereotypically saccharine-cute caucasian kids. The previous reviewer said there were hand motions, but the motions are very limited. Not really enough to be worthy of mention."
5,Wow!,"This cd is a work-out for both the band and the listener - some of the most intense passages, complicated rhythms I've ever heard. It's a case of extremely talented musicians digging deep and letting loose - but keeping cohesion and purpose. Definitely a must-have for Chick fans and jazz fans and lovers of all intelligent, well-crafted, powerful music."
1,Disc was not all its cracked up to be,"I have listened to it several times trying to find some sign of musical talent, but it is simply rubish. The terrible vocals ruin every song. If you like a whiny brit voice dubbed over goofy techno then its for you. Otherwise, save your money and your sanity."
2,Not worth the trouble,"""How To Operate With A Blown Mind"" is a great example of a disc trying to be everything and winding up with nothing. There are some nice parts here, such as the ""Planet Rock""-sampling ""Kool Roc Bass"", ""Blisters On My Brain"", and ""Vision Incision"", but overall, this just ain't cutting it. It's like the All-Stars were trying so hard to impress with clever sampling or distorted vocals they forgot what actually impresses - sharp songwriting and a knowledge of what makes music work. There's plenty of other good techno, both of the big-beat variety and others, so there isn't much reason to buy this one."
1,"Hated it... ""Battleflag"" unedited even stunck","Not worth [price] in the bargain bin. I found this album to be awful, and the level of profanity is not needed. I'm all for explicit lyrics, but I think at times lack of creativity forces some artists to drop in profanity. If you are a die-hard techno-rave person, then maybe this is for you, otherwise dont bother."
5,An oddesy through the underworld of sound,"I'm a long time techno fan, but I've been totally blown away by this album. Its a total leap forward from any other album I own, it truly is a trip from the close of a rave to the 'morning after' and the slow depressing return to everyday life. This is one of my all time top five albums and I would reccomend it to anyone, no matter what kind of music you like."
5,"Oh my god, Oh my god, Oh my god, Oh my god, Oh my god","This Cd is so good I could now breathe after I heard it the first time. This CD goes first in line of ALL techno bands EVER. I dont care if you are Fatboy Slim. The All Stars make Mr. Slim seam like _______ ( fill the lamest thing you can possibly think of here.) A persons life is not completed without this CD. You must be kicked in the sack at least 100 times if you do not own it. Saying all this just sounds subtle in the greatness of the lo fidelity all stars. I'm still haing a hard time finding out the lyrics though. Mail me tham if ou know what they are. So, in conclusin my mind must allways be blown because this CD is like a bible."
5,The best band to come from Britain since Portishead,"The Lo Fidelity Allstars make great music. With their amazing talent, and their great creativity. They fill their music with great rythm, that will pump you up, and keep you runnin'"
1,it sucks,"I listened to Battleflag and it rocked. If i had the chance to do it all over, i would buy the single and use the money for beer."
2,One good single doesn't cut it folks,"Yes I did buy this album after hearing ""Battle Flag"", so did almost everyone. ""Battle Flag"" is one of the best singles the dance floor has seen in awhile but the rest of the album is just an orgy of boring samples (I am sicken that they used a sample from the Black Panthers), wannabe white boys trying to rap and dull beats that go nowhere. Like Fatboy Slim, Lo Fidelity make cheesy bubblegum dance music for the stupid masses ( I'm sure every raver that has no brain cells love this album.) Just buy the single and skip this album. Go for an album by Underworld or VNV Nation for music of the genre that is good throughout the whole album and meaningful."
1,Junky techno and HORRIBLE vocals!,"When I heard the single Battleflag I thought, I need that CD, and I searched everywhere for it finally I found it here and I ordered it and it really did not live up to my expectations. Battleflag is the only song on the album that is really good. The cheesy techno and the dude doing the vocals sounds like a messed up version of Liam Gallagher from Oasis. To get to the point I think it's horrible. It's just a bunch of junky techno and the lead singer really makes my stomach cringe. Don't waste your cash."
2,Its alright,"i have had a lot of better CD's, this one was just about worth buying. battle flag was the only song that is really good."
1,"Battle Flag-5 stars, the rest-0 stars.","Often, I wonder how the record company people decide which track on an album to release first to create a good impression and increase sales. If I had to do it on most albums, I'm not sure I'd do very well; however, anybody (including me) would be able to realize that if this album has any chance of success on the store shelves, Battle Flag has to be released first and then the band should hurriedly put out a new album to cover up the embarrassment of the rest of the tracks. --buy the single if you can find it and forget about the rest of the pitiful tracks on this CD."
2,"Another uneventful electronica act lands in MTV's ""buzz bin""","Repetitiousness is the first quality that shot through my skull. How many minutes can you play a pattern over and over and again and again with no variation at all?Pretentiousness was number two. Man, does that guy really like to play up that bad english accent! The lyrics are poseur fluff.The samples are unimaginative. The beats, sequencing and drum sounds are outmoded and cliche'. I got through the CD about 2 times before I had to go ""NEXT TRACK!"" after about 1:30 into each song.I bought ""El Oso"" by Soul Coughing at the same time and I can't stop listening to that. Worth checking out."
2,boring,Was interesting the first listen but doesn't stand up to repeat listens. Really unimaginative.
1,Tedium At It's Most Tedious,"I bought this cd for one song: Battleflag. Same with most of us, I'd assume. Unfortunately, there are no other songs on this album. I don't mean good songs, I mean songs, period. All the tracks on this album, except for Battleflag, are just some english guy talking with weird...sounds in the background trying to pass as beats. I'm as big a fan of electronica as you can get, but trash like this gives it a bad name. If amatuers like this stopped producing cds, maybe we'd get a electronica influx instead of pop. The bottom line is, if you want a good electronica cd, get the chemical brothers SURRENDER or fatboy slim's YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY, BABY instead. Do yourself a favour, get the Battleflag MP3 and stay clear from this stinker."
3,oh well....,Battle Flag kicked butt. I had trouble finding out who did it and when I did bought it right away. I was disappointed with the rest of the tracks on the CD but I have a feeling they will grow on me. Hate it when that happens.
4,Hail london!,"These british guys really know how to dish out a nice round of hard-beat-bass-kicking-techno. I'm a big fan of Chem Bros and although I think they are still better, I would recomend giving these guys a try. None of the songs on this cd are bound for stardom, but it makes an excellent ""sanity saver"" while you are driving or just messing around on the computer. Techno fans will eat this one up."
3,"They have a great potential, but this is mostly dance track","The first one or two listens will blow your mind. After that you'll do alot of fast-forwarding to find the small bits that originally blew your mind. But this group has great potential. There's a good 30 seconds worth of mind-blowing sounds on this CD that are scattered around. If you love to dance you'll love it. Most tracks are too long (over 7 minutes). If you almost love this CD, get Beastie Boys' Hello Nasty."
2,"Except for the Pigeonhead remix, a weak offering","That one song is a five star effort. The rest is just short of amateur. When does Pigeonhead get a record deal?If you like that one good song, try Tin Star or Underworld or Soul Coughing's ""Ruby Vroom""."
4,Pretty sweet,Lo Fidelity has some cool songs on it but the tunes are not up to par with FBS or CB. I would recommend this cd to anyone looking for a great techno/rock/hiphop cd though. Can't wait to hear more from them.
5,excellent value!,"Quality replacement part to solve a common problem with the 4.0 Jeep engine. Has useful information pamphlet! Painless, quick order and good price on high quality part. I love my new Idley Activator, it makes my 96 XJ purrrrr so smooth!"
5,Gatlin Boys!!,"I saw them in person and they gave a great performance, I've always enjoyed their music. I can tell ya one thing, they will give ya all they got. They have put out some pretty good tunes, I think you would really enjoy them."
5,Another winner by Nicole Holofcener,"Another great story by Nicole Holofcener - the writer/director behind Friends with Money and Lovely & Amazing. One of my favorite director. She writes real life stories as well as the best of them - Woody Allen, Alexander Payne, Mike Leigh, Winnie Holtzman, etc. Love her and really dig this movie."
5,Poignant character study,"One of those films that captures life in NYC and the often intense introspection that goes with the place. Great character study. Reflective, sad and true. Captures the funny yet sad state that many of us find ourselves in. Like a long, pensive walk along an abandoned beach in the rain reflecting on the idiosyncrasies embedded in our familial relationships along with the symbiotic relationships we experience with others which bring meaning to our lives. One of those ""hmmmm...."" films."
1,Incoherent Dribble,"This movie is a base, rambling heap of garbage. It's incoherent, has no real conflict, and I simply can't understand why so many people give it good reviews. It's somewhat visually pleasing until Oliver Platt waddles on-screen to add a sub-plot that truly boggles the mind (really? he's going to get both Catherine Keener and Amanda Peet?!)The characters are uninteresting and I can't seem to find a real motivation behind any of their actions. Nothing is resolved except the little girl gets an expensive pair of jeans at the end of the movie."
1,Do not let the price fool you,"This unit died within 4 months of installation. It states marine quality enclosed in a housing. The boards might be coated, but the terminal for the wiring harness is not. A pin corroded for the accessory power wire and broke off. Jensen (ASA Electronics) would not honor warranty with an internet purchase. Do not waste your money on the attractive price. I have replaced with a quality Kenwood that is certified IPX5."
2,Doesn't fit.,There seems to be a problem with how this is listed. It is a completely different size then the stock steering stabilizer on my 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. The mounts are too narrow for this product and a custom mount would have to be manufactured. The bolts which come with this are also too wide to fit in the stock bolt holes.
3,I like this saw but...........,"The bad stuff first ...The blade is prone to fall out and needs changing frequently. The ""laser"" and dust port are useless. It has NO safety features, not for beginners!!!The good stuff now... I paid around $20 for this jigsaw and for cutting plywood and basic stuff it works better than ok. All in all I like this saw for basics but if your looking for quality or longevity I think you should look elsewhere."
1,no sir,"it does not cut straight, just curved to the right. it is better to get a brand name than risk buying this tool. it may work well for you but you will be taking a chance. would not recommend it."
3,Woop's,"Gentlemen; I love everything about my jigsaw... except when I go to connect to dust vacume... the hole inside is blocked completely, even adapter is restricted from going all the way in ???"
4,My children love this!,"I bought these blocks for my 2 year old daughter. She loves to build with these, as well as our 4, 7, 11 and 13 year old children. Our whole family has enjoyed the fun shapes. I was concerned that the wood would not be smooth, but have found the blocks to be terrific! I like having a carry-case for them so they store neatly - although beware that the handles broke easily on the plastic lid. Even so, next time I will buy more than one set to expand our building options."
5,Blocks are best,"These blocks have been awesome for our kids. This is absolutely the one toy they have played with on a daily basis for almost 2 years. The blocks are not a choking hazard which means even my baby can play, and I don't have to worry about paint safety. Its so fun to see what they create every day."
4,An Enjoyable Performance,"I agree with many of the reviews here. This is a great performance. I am a huge fan of Domingo, Freni, Bumbry, and Ghiaurov. This was one of Freni's most dramatic roles, and its fun to see her explore this side of her singing, although generally I would prefer someone a little more spinto."
3,"""Don Carlo""","It's good to see this opera performed complete with the Fontainbleu scene, but the singing and playing are a little disappointing. ""Don Carlo"" was a problematic work for Verdi, and the Met production does not seem to have much faith in it. Even Domingo does not carry conviction. Freni as usual is good but unexciting. Everyone seems to be just going through the motions."
3,DVD Quality - faulty?,"This comment is not about the artists - there are a number of comments covering that issue already.I ordered ""Don Carlo"" some time back, and I found that the DVD would skip, and then stay frozen.Figuring that it might have been my fault, I ordered another DVD.Lo and behold, the second DVD has the same problem.I wonder if any one else has had this trouble...."
4,Sumptuous Opera,"Let me keep it simple. Wonderful opera with great cast, staging, orchestration, sound quality, video quality, costumes, libretto and plot, even sub-titles. So why just 4 stars? Ultimately I have to judge this opera compared to all of Verdi's operas and all operas. Il Trovatore is a 5 star opera to me."
2,"Much too journalist, not enough scientist.","I though that the book, The End of Physics was too much like a skeptical newspaper article, and not enough scientific interest. The book was hardly informative, and much too pesimistic. I can't even give the book away."
5,Good choice for a low-budget PC,"I used this MB with a Sempron 3400+ to build a PC for my grandparents, with a total cost of around 250$ you cant go wrong if you really need a pc for your kids or grandparents, perfect for basic task such web surfing, emails, instant messanging, etc. Recommended"
2,"Reaches high, falls short","On one level Maximortal is straight up satire of Superman's fictional and real lives.The Maximortal arrives on Earth as a baby, is discovered by two kindly farmers and (as a baby with god-like powers) promptly kills several hundred people before being imprisoned by the army.Meanwhile an unscrupulous publisher steals the character True Man from two struggling cartoonists and proceeds to make millions from their ideas while they live in poverty.Eventually the real Maximortal becomes the fictional True Man and things get strange.There are metaphysical ideas about fiction and reality, belief and magic but honestly they never really come together as anything profound.As other reviewers have said there is some disturbing images, some cheap shocks and some genuinely good bits but overall it's a confusing mess."
4,great book for visually discriminating people,this is a very nicely printed and designed book and a really good present for anyone who loves design and has an active imagination. I bought 30 for my clients.
2,Wait! Not what you think!,"The book is much smaller than it seems in dimension and thickness. More pocket size. Also, except for just a few pages, the face images are not as well done as I thought they would be or should be!Save your money."
3,Not much of a good product..,"After two weeks of the delivery of the product, one of the buttons don't wanna work anymore. I called the customer service but I haven't got a chance to ship it in yet for a replacemnt.The unit itself does have some good features such as FM with recording along with voice recording. And plays folders as well but not as easy as you can select it. And also comes with several black lit colors as wel.If your on an SD card, you have to start all over on the play list when you turn the unit back on. The unit itself is very fragile and the plastics can be easly scratched. One of the holders for the back battery cover broke off."
1,A Classic Example of Political Hypocrisy,"Chretien's ghost-written autobiography is brimming with phony Canadian patriotism and dull-witted ""straight from the hip"" comments that have gained the prime minister notoriety among his fellow Canadians. Almost every single principle that Chretien professes faith in between the covers of this tome has been contradicted by his first four years as PM; from senate reform to patronage. This book reads like and is about as believable as a Liberal Party campaign pamphlet and should be filed along with the Liberal red book campaign platform under ""U"" or ""P"" for Unkept Promises. If Canadians wish to read an autobiography that gives real insight to a Canadian politician's motivations and beliefs, check out Preston Manning's ""New Canada""."
2,no point,This book is boring!!!The point of it is at about the end.There are only 8 chapters in this book.The main idea started happening at about chapter 7.the girl hurts her knee at chapter 5.THIS IS A BAD BOOK!!!
4,Boston's overlooked R.E.M.,"Just as the music scene had piqued in the late 80's in Boston, along came O Positive with their two EP's, Only Breathing & Cloud Factory. Going with ecletic verses and sparce guitar driven rock, the comparrisons to early REM are unavoidable. And yet they took REM's sound and ran with it to create the highly catchy EP's compiled here. Unfortunetely, Epic Records picked them up and destroyed them with an over-produced bland album called ""Toyboat"". On the plus side, the Canadian label Link found these EP's and made them into one great listening experience."
2,Not worth it,Definitely not up to the normal Plan Toy standards. My son was so excited to get these and the very sad within the hour because the roller one broke.
1,Rip Off,"If it looks like you are getting three nice sized toys here, think again. The whole box is smaller that the last watch box I got. It is definitely NOT worth $20+. Go to another item and leave this one behind. This was one of two Christmas wish list items that I bought and just know the people they are for will be totally disappointed. I know I was. If I had seen this item in a Dollar General Store for more than $2, I would not have purchased it."
3,"Very cute, but small and steam roller broke day 1","I love Plan toy products and was very excited to get this construction set for my son despite the price. Wow, are they small! Like another reader, it's my fault for not looking more carefully at the specs. I just assumed they would be in proportion to the size of the airplane that came with his Plan City Airport--not so! Much smaller and no way little Plan people can ride on them. What a shame!The biggest disappointment is that we've only had the set for 16 hours, and already the steam roller is broken. From simply pressing it with his hand (not dropping or stepping on it or anything), my 2 yr old snapped the roller right off. The dowel holding the roller is plastic, as it turns out, so maybe that's a weakness? Anyway, I'm going to try to glue it back on, but my hopes aren't high for it lasting. These toys are much more delicate than any of the other Plan City items we've purchased."
5,huge entertainment value in a tiny package,"I bought this set of three construction toys for my 2 1/2 year old on his first trans-Atlantic airplane trip, and we found them totally charming. They're simple, but fully functional and surprisingly well-articulated; and the small size makes them very handy to put into pocket or purse, and appropriate for play at restaurant, museum, park bench, airplane seat, etc. The caterpillar tracks do come off easily but they're also very easy to put back on; and the roller broke along one of the narrower points, but was very easily glued, and is now as good as new again."
4,another good plan city toy,these are typical plan city vehicles - well made and fun to move around - the excavator's and bulldozer's tracks can come off a little too easily but go back on easily too if they don't get lost - my 4 year old son loves them
5,"Very scary and lively story, and humorously written.","The minute you start to read, immediately the story takes you along. Its a real doctor Who story.You don't want to stop reading, it's that exciting.No spoilers from me.. enjoy reading."
3,"Not everything I hoped for, yet a good read.","I was hoping to ""see"" the regeneration from the 8th to the 9th Doctor, but we did not get it. Just a quick, ""Well I'm off to die!"" at the end of the book. The story was good enough, but it headed in a completetly different direction two thirds of the way through. If you like the 8th Doctor, this is a good book. It just didn't quite answer all the questions I had."
4,Great power match to scope,Brings things right up close and personal. It is about as far as you would like to take the magnification for the 60mm scope but it works very well. You have to scan the moon to see all of it. The only down side I see is the 4mm is a pretty small hole to keep in the focus of your eye. It requires a steady head. It might be better to use the barlow lens and a larger objective to realize similar magnification. But I have no complaints.
1,"NOT the Born to Lose about Johnny Thunders feat DeVille, Kramer","Amazon has screwed up this listing by mixing up two films with the same name, and featuring the names of both directors and both sets of people who appear. This one here as of this date is a fictional piece about a punk band in LA. I returned it without watching.I don't know if this film is a deliberate effort to rip people off, but Amazon is not helping with the screwed up listing. I have advised them of this but so far not worth their attention."
1,"""One Eyed King"" Review","Actually, it deserves 0 stars.I'm a big fan of Chazz Palminteri and a big fan of mafia stories, but this one didn't cut the cake. I hate to give any movie a 1 star, but it deserves it. The story line was choppy, the acting wasn't on que, and it was hard to believe most of the characters. All in all, don't bother renting this. I couldn't even finish the movie."
3,One Eyed King,"Decent movie. I enjoyed the acting mostly. The actors carried the movie. The plot was good, but overdone. c+"
2,Too expensive.,The case needs to be a little deeper and it could use a handle to make it easier to carry. Not worth the price I paid.
5,James Taylor Live MD,A superb album of James Taylor's best songs done in a live venue. Excellent live recording with a host of talented musicians that know how to help James render his songs.

1,AGONY: A Memoir,"This book supports the old saying that you can't judge a book by its cover. It was boring and tedious. As a dog lover, I can certainly relate to head tilts, but that was about it. I wish I had spent my money on a donation to the local animal shelter."
3,So so,Kinda long and not very entertaining but gets the message across to pre schoolers. Might be good for a kinder class at the beginning of the year.
3,Not what I thought,"It only says 'Hands are not for hitting' once or twice. Most of the book gives the child positive things to do with their hands (which is good), but I was looking for something else, I guess."
4,Book for Pre Schoolers NOT Toddlers!,"I bought this book thinking it's for my 2 year old when really I read the cover and it said it was for kids from 4-7 years of age. So, right now I am going to save it til then!"
2,Spankers beware!,"Those of us who occasionally resort to a spank now and again may not appreciate this book which fails to differentiate between toddler act-out and a parental form of discipline called ""spanking"". This is a shame, because when properly and MODERATELY dispensed with, a parent can get the attention of a toddler like no other form of disclipline. I'm sure most people can relate to the thwarting of a child's insane attraction to things like busy streets, playing hide-and-seek in shopping malls, electrical sockets, etc. whereby a spank (or the threat of one)most likely has saved a child's life!!"
3,"Nice, but not what I expected","This book devotes each page to nice things that hands can be used for. That's good, but I would have liked a bit more on why hitting is not a good idea."
3,"good, but too wordy","This is a good book, based on the whole series. But to me, and my 28 month old son, it is too wordy. I have cut out a lot of it and picked out my own main points that deal with his behavior problems and left out a lot of other stuff. I think the board book would be better, like the others I have (Teeth Are Not for Biting and Feet Are Not for Kicking). Maybe would be better for older kids. But I still like the concept and he still enjoys it, just not as much as the other two."
1,NOW MADE IN CHINA,Beefeater went for profit over the health of our pets. Sad! Gimborn (Pro Treats) are still made in the USA.
2,My first manga hopefully won't be my favorite,"This WAS my first manga. I had wanted it for two weeks or so. When I got to the store (Borders) I spent a good 30 minutes looking for it when I finally found it. Part of the cover was ripped and it wasn't in great condition, but it was the only one they had. I spent a LOT of money on that thing... I was SO disappointed when I finally read that book. The poem and song was wonderful, but the plot was confusing and I couldn't understand it. Sue was annoyingly innocent and bugged me quite a bit, also taking away one star from my review. Who is Ora? Huh? Ohhh...she's the singer. You shoulda told me that in the beginning. Are these two guys gay? Umm...I don't know. The whole thing was very confusing. It wasn't HORRIBLE, but it was..bad. I could've saved that money for something I'd actually like and used...and I highly regret buying that book, after reading some of my neighbor's manga (Ah! My Goddess)Not worth it.-Kyleen"
1,This isn't the real clover book,"Ok this isn't the real clover series. This is extremly different than the orginal series. The orginal is about a girl named Suu her name means four in chinese. Because she is a four leaf clover and has amazing powers. She doesn't meet the cat group or whatever she is locked away in a cage because of the clover project so other governments won't capture her! she doesn't meet some weird guy ! she is introduced to Ryuu Feye Kazuhiko. She doesn't have mechanichal wings sometimes she gets them when she wants to summon them. If you ask me this manga series is pretty battered by the dubbers. So if you want the orignal ,learn japanese and order the manga.Also the orginal has a better story line and they aren't stories they are manga novels.So if you want to know where you can find the better version e-mail me cloversuu879@aol.com ja ne."
4,Beleive in Your Child's Capabilities,Shakuntala Devi writes an empowering book for both parents and teachers of children. We need to understand that genuis and exceptional abilites exist in all children. Devi delivers the compelling message that the child genuis develops through enrichment and through positive interaction with their environment. This book provides an excellent model for parents to help unlock their child's potential.
2,This CD has only 2 songs,"Amazon should indicate that track 4,5,6 are only snippets. Track 3 is an idiot talking of B*witched and track 2 is not that good. I bought this CD because I thougt it has 6 songs. What a gullible I am."
3,"Squeaky Voices, but good melody choices.","These four ladies can belt out songs like Jewel sings the national anthem, but after about two minutes they get on your nerves. Of this whole single, I loved the chorus of ""C'est la Vie"". They used the chorus on the television drama, ""Dawson's Creek"", and immediately I was interested in finding out who the group was. The Irish foursome can get you dancing, but sooner or later your hands will be over your ears."
3,cool song: c'est la vie,I really like the song c'est la vie but the next song is horrible...have you listened to the lyrics: don't be a brontasaurus...come on people that is just scary
3,Totally cool!,"C'est la vie is a really cool song, and B'witched is also a really cool band! I went to their concert (they opened for N'SYNC) on March 16, and it was really good! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK B*witched!"
2,Not very inspiring,This CD has not got what it takes. I would not pass it for singing. The music is good with a lively beat but the band is so annoying.
4,makes you wanna dance,C'est la vie is the kinda song you have to move your feet too. Its not my favoriot song but I do like it. I also like everybody get happy the other song on thier single.
5,Very entertaining,"Fun show to watch; I've seen each episode more than once. A bit corny at times, but overall better than most other shows available."
3,cherry pickin 3,This season not a good as season 1 and 2 some episodes seem more staged and rehearsed rather than recording their travels
2,"Decent entertainment, but very unrealistic",Two guys making a living by driving thousands of miles to buy junk that they turn for maybe $50 profit? Right. The best review I have seen on the subject is at practicalfrugalliving dot wordpress dot com in the September articles.
4,These guys are always entertaining.,You never fail to learn something of the value of items when you watch this show. Watch these guys you may learn something.
4,Love these guys,I have always loved searching for great things other people call junk. So glad to see others making their dreams come true and make a nice living at it too!
3,junk,favorite thing is to sell junk just like see ing how much stuff may be worth that no on else thinks is valueable.
3,Average Tuner,"Unfortunately it only has one Coax input and honestly, who uses s-video these days. I knew what I was buying though, this is pretty much your only choice if you have a small form factor case. The card itself works fine once you get through the driver installation process. Don't bother with the drivers on the CD that come with it. They FULLY don't work. Save yourself the frustration and download the latest drivers from the Hauppage website. The installation of those drivers is strange as well but they do work. WinTV Software that comes with the card is uber lame."
3,Didn't fit my case,"This card did not fit into my computer case (a typical, medium sized desktop computer). The card is the ""Low profile"" version. I am not sure, but I think that means its meant to fit in those new vcr-shaped livingroom media center PCs. I plan to return this and buy the non-lowprofile version."
4,cat breed book,have been looking for this book for ages and finally found one reasonably priced via amazons sellers. the book looks brand new and it arrived as scheduled without problem
3,Van Gogh terrace,Part of this puzzle was fun. There was a lot of dark space which wasn't. Van Gogh's style of splotchy paint colors made a lot of it difficult. Since the pieces are similar it was tedious in those areas.
4,Brother-in-law loved it,I thought it was over priced for what I got but he liked it that's all that mattered. Oh well
4,"reasons for taking land, and how to value the land","The book surveys the history of eminent domain in the United States, up to 1975. An often contentious issue that has retained its topicality. Several key court cases are reviewed, along with the reasonings by the various levels of government regarding the taking of private land. Being the US, many of the arguments revolve around the applicability of various amendments to the federal constitution.Another issue gone into is how to value private land that is to be taken over. Here, the use of the marketplace in providing pricing information is crucial, by being hopefully independent of both the land owner and the government.The book also delves into the restrictions on land use, as opposed to outright taking. Reasons include for public safety and health. As you might expect, this can affect the land's value, causing more arguments to break out."
5,Unjustly neglected beauty,"Winter Hours may not have been a major name even in their heyday, but they made some stunningly beautiful music. The wonderfully chosen cover painting, ""September Morn,"" sums up their work: quietly passionate, with hints of something secret, wistful, yet deeply moving in the luminous moment between dreaming & waking. ""Hyacinth Girl"" sounded hauntingly familiar the first time you heard it, evoking memories you didn't even know you had ... and that feeling only intensified the more you heard it. These are songs like exquisite miniatures, perfect for musing and reflection. This needs to be in print again -- highly recommended!"
5,Alternate 80's Music Junkie,"I went to school in Athens, GA -- home to REM, the B-52's, and Dreams So Real (another lost 80's band). With all the great music in and around Athens, Winter Hours was my favorite. I saw them play several times -- great band, great music."
5,"It's All About ""Hyacinth Girl""","Winter Hours were just one of many, many fabulous bands from my late-teen, early-twenty years. Many of these bands are rarely discussed anymore (Game Theory, Let's Active, Reivers, Camper Van Beethoven, Robyn Hitchcock & the Egyptians, the Feelies, The DBs, etc.), but I recall many joyous evenings at the Berkeley Square with the music, the girls, the drink. Those days are long behind all of us, and the music and the memories have dulled a bit. However, at some point every year or two, either my friend or I still muse: ""Say, dude...you remember that song 'Hyacinth Girl'""? Just that simple rhetorical statement takes us both back to those glory days of almost 20 years ago (gasp!). I do not own this CD, and I do not think I will purchase it. I have my old vinyl and that will be enough. But for those who never had the privilege, this is magical music. Buy up!"
5,Island of Jewels guitar solo one of the best ever!!!!!!,"Very simply, a must have for everyone who knows anything about great music. Put on your list of CD's to have forever."
2,Overrated,"Maybe you can call me a Ramen expert..I recommend this ramen if you want to experience a Japanese ramen. It will taste OK for a couple of times, but you will be easily fed up with it. The soup base is too weak and naive. Yea, Japanese ramen is good but what I mean by that is the real ramen you can get in Japan.As to instant ramens, Korean ones are much better."
2,Better check it's actually in stock first...,"Placed an order a week ago when they said their was only ""5 left"". Received email same day confirming charge and shipment was made attached with tracking number too. 4 days later received another email saying they actually have none in stock and on temporary hold. Almost a week after placing the initial order had to cancel order. Through the duration of all this their amazon listing still said ""5 left"", which is misleading. Might of been only a one time occurrence for them, but not going to purchase from this vendor again."
5,Avid reader & crafter,"This halogen sunlight lamp is one of the greatest purchases I have ever made. At 48"" height with a large solid base, there is no danger of it tipping over and breaking, like the 6' tall halogen lamps do. I have my lamp right beside my favorite chair and I can adjust the swivel lighting unit to focus perfectly on the book I am reading or the project I am working on."
3,"Great idea, typical Chinese construction","Well, it's a great idea and a great tool for troubleshooting charging systems as you can drive the car around and monitor the voltage.The construction is pretty shoddy, don't expect much, but it is cheap."
5,Not nearly as fragile as others have claimed. Fine product!,"This is well made for a non-commercial use product. Others have claimed that it is made of cheap plastic and it will break easily. I'm sure it will break like any plastic product if it's battered and mishandled. I've tested it in three of our family vehicles and it works VERY well. There have been NO signs of a tendency to crumble or break when handled as someone described in a previous review. I like the way it tilts depending on the angle needed to view the digital readout and lighted display. This device is like having a medical thermometer around the house, available when needed. You may not use it very often but it's nice to have available. So why should it be ""robust"" and ruggedly built? Maybe there should be a rugged upgraded model available for the service station owner who would use it constantly. Buy it. It works well and it's a great bargain!"
4,"Good idea, short stem","The only problem I have is that for a Lincoln Mark VII, the stem is a quarter inch too short and almost impossible to connect. Have to place backwards and read upside down."
1,Best you get a real voltmeter.,"This LCD meter has been driving me crazy. I've been trying to debug my electrical system because it indicates 11.9 volts when at the battery I get 12.6 volts with two different multimeters. The trouble is with this crappy device that indicates eratically, sometimes 12.7 and other times at 11.4. It's taken me several hours to find out the problem is with this device. You'd be better off to get a real 12 volt meter."
3,"works, but made cheap",I think this thing lasted 30 seconds in my RV. It sticks out and my kids brushed by it and snapped it off.Oh well.
3,Vector Cigarette lighter voltmeter,"I bought several as stocking stuffers for my driving sons. On occasion I get no start calls, and I wanted to have some way to get data on the charging system to diagnose over the phone. As the other reviewers stated the unit is good for battery voltage when car is not running and alternator voltage when car is running. The critical info. it will not give me is the drop in voltage when the car is started. Instead it just ""resets"" and just waits until the car is running. This is a big drawback as far as I am concerned. The lack of voltage drop info limits me from diagnosing battery condition, some info. about excess starter draw, or a poor connection at the starter, battery etc. In retrospect I would have not purchased until I was sure I had a voltmeter that could show me voltage drop. Does anyone know if others do? I might return the ones I have not opened."
5,Great item - I use it in my airplane,"Experiencing dificulties in my airplane related to variable voltage I purchased this voltmeter and plugged it in. It works great and lets me know exactly what the voltage is, as in the alternator gets turned off and I start to use battery power, this gauge lets me know exactly when that happens. Excellent piece of equipment. It is not robust, being made of plastic but works great for what it is!"
4,Ideal for quick summary of battery/ charging circuit,"Very compact tester- fits in shirt pocket or under motorcycle seat. Gives good indication of battery state of charge and how well the charging system is performing. A smaller display than Innova model, but adequate for its purpose."
2,Minimalist auto voltmeter,"This product has a dim display, a questionable voltage reading, and is poorly designed for viewing the display. Buy the Equus 3721 (which I did) and found it far superior."
1,Hairdo u FLUNKS,"What a piece of trash this one is. Stereotypes abound, from gays to hot black chicks with the only thing on their mind--sex (the same for the black men), and the inevitable fat black chick who's favorite pastime is fried chicken. At the beginning there's a funeral and no explanation at the end, so the only thing to conclude is the film died."
4,EXCELLENT!,"Rent this today! You will LOVE it. While, obviously working with a small budget, this film still comes out on top."
3,Nice Gerber 07550 with some shortcoming,"This multitool is a nice looking and well crafted. However, when I tried opening a cap on a bottle of sparkling drink - it failed big time. The body of the took would not allow the cap opener to hook into the cap's lip. It probably works OK if the bottle is skinny like a Coke. I was disappointed but the rest of the tool probably work well."
3,warning when handling it with oxide coating,"much of the black oxide coating will come off on your hands (and anything else it touches), its messy!the tool itself is nice, not much wobble in tools.I even tried rubbing it down with some wd40 to at least cut back on the mess; first few rags were black after just a wipe off.so overall, tool ok, oxide coating is more like somebody just dipped it in charcoal dust."
4,Decent Gerber for the price,"It does what I need it do, my only complaints would be that to pull the needle nose out, it takes a little bit of work and the mechanisms feel a little flimsy. The plastic release/locking mechanisms also feel flimsy for the tools inside the handle.The black rubs off on your hands so maybe I would have been better off getting a standard stainless steel version.The sheath is nice and textile with a big gerber logo on the flap and comes with a belt loop."
3,Bought as a replacement for a lost leatherman wave,"I bought this to replace a leatherman wave I thought I had lost. Its a good tool, but I am glad I found my wave. I have this in one of my bags and the leatherman in another (the one I use most), its a good back up but if I ever lose the wave I will be buying another one.Everything on the gerber works fine, I just don't like the way it works as much as a leatherman. Its a fully functional, good utility knife. I would not feel bad taking it hunting, fishing, or camping, but I still would rather have my wave with me instead. I think the two are comparable, sort of chevy vs. ford, or mac vs. pc. It really just comes down to personal preference."
5,exactly what I expected,Works great I use it every day and it definitely lives up to the Gerber name. I have not had any problems with it like the other people have stated and the black oxide did not rub off onto my hands either.
3,False Advertising/Looks used,"The pictures associated with this multi tool are misleading and worked on me. Some of the pictures show a set of additional extensions such as Philips drivers and flat head drivers and hex shaped ones. These did not come with the tool and are in more than one picture. Also the knife didn't just come dull, it came in such a condition where it looked like it was used to cut on something very hard like metal. The blades edge is literally chipped. Like acid worked on it or something. Never saw a ""new"" knife in such a condition. I know some new knives require some touching up but it will take a lot longer than usual to get this blade in usable order. The tool has scratches on it as well so it looks used and the black coating will rub off a lot on your hands. I expect a lot better, especially with a Gerber. Everything else with the tool looks in working order. The sheath was made in china but seems in good condition and durable."
5,great tool love gerber prodcts,gotta love gerber tools don't feel right without a pair on my belt it's become one of the things i have to have with me when i leave the house
3,not as goog as i expect,i use it to install Screws&#65292;after that some paint chipped. not good . i can see silveryit happened then again then i cut thin wire
4,Great Multi-tool,This is a great tool .I think it is just as comparable to a Leatherman. It is strong and does not get sloppy after some use .I will buy another one if I loose this one. I am very happy. Yeah at first you get some black on your hands .But It's not much.
5,"heavy duty, will stand up for years of use","This hose is much thicker than previous hoses I've had on RV's. Well worth spending a little extra, than buying standard RV waste hose."
5,Great Sewer Hose,"Great sewer hose for your camper, it worked fine all last summer.It attached fine to my sewage connector and looks like pretty good material."
5,Ready for next trip,"I ordered the Heavy Duty Sewer Hose after reading the other reviews, which were good. There was one review where the buyer complained it was impossible to get the hose over the fittings. It was a snug fit, but a little lubricant on the fittings and it was done. It does take a little time and patience, but it is on and we are ready to go. Thanks, great product."
2,Probably not what you want,"I love the ETX 70, it's a cheap but good rich field telescope. But this isn't the best way to improve it. There are two problems really. The first is that the ETX 70 doesn't take this much magnification very well for various reasons, both optical and mechanical. The other is that the quality of this eyepiece is not good. Admittedly it's cheap, but for only a little more, you can buy a good quality orthoscopic (I'd recommmend a bit longer focal length). Or buy a barlow that doubles the magnification of your supplied 9mm eyepiece (so you can see for yourself what I mean about too much magnification) but also doubles your supplied 25mm to a very useful 28x so you don't waste your money."
1,Im dubious...,.. a furor would have started over this had UMG tried to release it-unless its grey market from Tiawan
4,Decent & informative.,"Outside of Cash's own autobiographies, most of the biographies dealing with Johnny Cash are none too good. This one isn't really detailed enough but it's good for quick info and the articles from Rolling Stone are very well written. Definitly worth a look if you're a Cash fan."
1,didn't work,"Didn't work for me at all, total waste of money, I work out and do weight watchers, still nothing, just didn't work"
3,Hurt my stomach,I have a very senstive stomach and this hurt my stomach. I would not discredit it I'm sure it would be fine for others but had to return it because of my stomach pain.
1,Was this pill suppose to do something?,"Simply put: Don't waste your money.My mom had started taking the super citrimax from vitamin world and she told me that it was giving her more energy to exercise after a long day at work.I was thrilled because that is just the thing I had been looking for!Well, maybe the two are different because I was not so lucky.I received my bottle of Citrimax and there was this strange white powder coating all the pills.I sifted through the pills in the bottle to find that one of the vitamins had cracked open and the stuff on the inside was now coating the outside of all the vitamins creating a huge mess.Honestly, I began taking the pills with hopes of a specific thing: energy.This citrimax just didn't preform.Sorry!"
4,It works for me,"People have said that this product doesn't work. But it does for me. I use it in conjunction with a healthy diet, and I actually burn more fat off. It has been said that citrimax slows down the rate in which carbohydrates convert over to fat in your body. That's something that I can appreciate. If your scarfing down large amounts of food all day, expecting that diet pills are going to erase that fact, it's not, and you're not going to lose weight. These diet products are made to assist you, not be the miracle that does all the work for you. It's a good product, and it's helping me.Super Citrimax Extra Strength 750 mg - 180 Capsules"
2,Too much Iodine & Ginseng,"I was disappointed that Amazon does not specify that this product contains Iodine & Ginseng and the amounts that are in this product. Had I known that, I would never had purshased Super CitriMax."
2,Extreme Headaches,"I took for a few days and experienced a really bad headache. Stopped for about 1 week, and started taking again and headaches returned. Did not work for me"
3,Great product but the image is wrong,"Just a warning about the bottle I actually got when I ordered this product. It does not say 750MG on the front label like the image here shows. Instead, on the nutrition information part of the label, it says that it contains 900MG Super Citrimax. That's good, but I didnt realize that until after I took two pills at once, which made me feel jumpy and gave me a headache. But taking 1 pill 3 times a day is really working for me. I have a lot more energy, my mood is much improved and it really works to block my appetite. I find that I actually forget to eat after I take it."
2,not a great recording of a not-so-great show,"Well, I like Pearl Jam, but I like each succesive record less than the one before. This live disc is no exception. Muddy, half-mumbled versions of old standbys. Vedder is an incredible singer; why does he just mumble all of the time!? The new song is cool, but nothing to write home about. The recording quality is comparable to that of an average bootleg, and the show itself is nothing magical. I thought their version of Neil Young's F***'n up was lame; they copped the Crazy Horse version almost note for note, and Eddie couldn't even remember the F***'n lyrics. Bottom line: it's entertaining to hear once, but it's not worth the 16 bucks 'cause you'll probably chuck it in a drawer for the next 5 years before you play it again."
4,Pearl Jam wows us with a high-quality live recording,"This recording surprised me in the soundboard quality, major-release recording, but left me with something to be desired. I have a pretty good collection of imports at home, and for the most part, it was nothing i haven't heard before. Nice to finally see live tracks of Nothingman and Off He Goes, as well as the rest of the ususal."
4,great live cd!!!,"This is one of the best live cd's I've ever heard. I had never really listened to Pearl Jam before until last week, but after listening to this cd about a week ago I am now a Pearl Jam fan. Good song selection! I wish they had a ""Very Best Of"", or ""Greatest Hits"" cd!, but until they do, this is the next best thing to have. If any Pearl Jam fans out there know if or when Pearl Jam will release a ""Very Best Of"", or ""Greatest Hits"" cd please write to me at: jdlucente@hotmail.com!!! They have been around for over a decade so isn't it about time?! Thank you!"
5,5 stars and I'm not even a PJ fan!,"I never ""got it"" until I heard this disc. These tracks just jam, especially compared to their studio stuff on compressed FM radio. Most of all, this is the cleanest live rock album I've ever heard. Even the picky Grateful Dead never sounded this clean. It's simply amazing to me how you can pick out each instrument individually. BUY IT!"
5,Unbelievable!,"Ok, If you are a fan of PJ or not, Buy this CD. There is no way imaginable that you could be unhappy with this Album. Studio cuts are great but nothing beats the incredible feeling of a live performance. These Guys are so tight, in buying this CD you get 72 straight minutes of music without so much as a whisper of a mistake. You get the perfect mixture of Hits and not as well known songs, so if you are already a fan, In buying this CD, you'll be catapulted into fanatic status, and if your not, you'll never be able to pass up a PJ CD thats not in your collection. Buy It!"
4,A great live album by the best band ever.,"I really like the album although having a shitload of bootlegs, it's not the best live album of theirs I own. It does contain the best version of Nothingman and the ""Untitled"" song is great. Buy it, you won't regret it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they have raised their own bar so high it's getting tough to top themselves."
3,Not good choice of songs on album,"I copied a Pearl Jam concert from a german show once (on radio) and I listen to that much more than this album. There are not enough rockers on here and I feel that they could have put more unusual tracks on here like 'State of Love and Trust' as well as classics like ""Not for you"". The best part of the Pearl Jam concert that I was at was definitely when they were rocking out, the songs that appear on this album sound better on the albums I don't see any point in buying this as there is nothing new here (except f#%&^ up by Neilo, which is cool although not that different from his version)."
5,Spectacular Audio Quality..Don't waste your time on bootlegs,I would have to say this is a must have for any Pearl Jam fan. I've purchased many bootlegs and many imports but this is wonderful quality. The treble and the bass of this mix is done quite well whereas most bootlegs or imports will not get the high quality bass. This is definitly as good as a studio recording but better since its LIVE!!!!
4,Great Album,"It would'nt be a Pearl Jam album if it didn't leave you wondering a bit - no ""Alive"", no ""Jeremy"". ""Daughter"" gives you three in one with a little ""w.m.a"" and Neil Young's ""Keep on Rockin' in the Free World"". Great Stuff!"
5,"If you've never heard Pearl Jam live, then buy this album!","I went to see Pearl Jam in concert and was stunned by the energy that filled the large auditorium as the music pounded and the fans chanted the lyrics(moans and growls included) keeping perfect time with the band. This album tries to bring that energy to those fans who haven't experienced the live version. The lyrics and music are intense...especially ""Hail, Hail"", ""Daughter"", and ""Nothingman"". Nothing short of amazing!"
4,Must Buy,"I've read a lot of complaints about the song mix (Did include this/Didn't include that). I think the mix was excellent and gives about two songs from each of their records. Loved ""Daughter"" with the middle break from Neil's ""Rockin' in The Free World"". ""MFC"" is also a standout. Bottom line - Pearl Jam shows that they are one of the best garage bands of all time. The live album strips down their sound to guitar/bass/drum and Ed V.Worth every cent. A CD of B sides would complement this nicely (hint-hint)."
5,it is incredable,this album is increadable the hits of the album are daughter and even flow but the whole album is awesome
4,For Those About To Rock I Salute You,"The songs on this live CD were performed amazingly well. New bass lines, endings and guitar solos turned old songs into new power. I did have a couple problems with this CD however, the main one being I thought the selection of songs was not that great. There were a lot of songs that were too soft to really rock the house off on the album. The only other thing that bugged me was poor sound quality. Any true Pearl Jam fan that does not get this is making a mistake but for newcomers I would reccomend holding off until you are more aquintated to the band."
3,"Good, At The Time",This was a good live PJ recording at the time it was released but Pearl Jam has released so many live recordings now it puts this collection to shame. If you're a PJ fan this can certainly help round out your collection but if you're looking for one good live PJ to add this is not the one.
5,wow.. Paul Samuels must be the biggest idiot on Amazon,"wow Pauly, you and your imaginary friend Jawn[whoever the h*ll he is] go to every freakin Pearl Jam album and say they suck, Creed ?rocks?, and RAAWWWRR...?Anyway, Pearl Jam are the best band ever, and I couldnt imagine anyone who gives Pearl Jam 1 or 2 stars knows good music at all."
5,Best live pearl jam album,"I have been very impressed with this live album since the first time that i heard it about eight years ago. I got really burned-out from the constant overplay of songs from the TEN album around 7th grade and that was over TEN years ago. So, now, i downright can't stand the radio songs. This live album is absolutely perfect. It has the songs that i wish the 3 disc live albums had, and they are played and sang the way i like. That being said, I highly recommend this album to anyone: From the flannel wearing grunge junkies, to the polo wearing frat kids trying to learn a tune to play to the ladies. All crowds satisfied."
1,Sickning,My friend told me to listin to this so i bought it and i ended up giving to my sister who doesnt even listin to it.
1,Pearl Jam's awful first full live release.,"Hey, that just goes without being said. All of their live albums suck because they suck. Go Creed! I can't wait for Scott Stapp's solo album! Awesome, baby!"
4,"It's PEARL JAM, they're great!","Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars, is because they left out my favorite songs...Yellow Ledbetter, All Those Yesterday, Not For You and Lucky Star. Oh well...maybe next time."
3,Good for the Road but not much else,"OK I admit. I'm a recent Pearl Jam enthusiast. Their songs bring out the best moods in me and I can relate to most of the stuff they say. I bought the new album hoping it would be different than the originals. Well, It wasn't. Corduroy and Do the Evolution are the only real tracks that stick out. The drum beats-which usually are loud and poppy-are surprisingly meek. The guitars are out of place it seems and Eddie seems to be stoned or strung out. If it was taken from their show in Dallas, there ya go. It is a good album for the enthusiast, but for the average joe fan it could be one that you could pass up."
5,S.I.M.P.L.Y. A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.,"Pearl Jam is best taken when its....LIVE!!! The amount of energy radiating from my cd-player has enough to power a small-size 3rd world nation for at least a year while playing this album. The song selection on this CD has the hardcore PJ fan in mind. And yes, its a bit of a disappointment that yellow is missing, or else it deserves a six-star scale."
5,Pearl Jam - 'Live On Two Legs' (Sony),"This 16-track disc was recorded live from the band's summer tour not to long ago.I've never had any Pearl Jam bootlegs before,so I was really glad to recieve this title.As for live albums,it's pretty flawless.I wasn't aware that Soundgarden's drummer Matt Cameron joined the band.Best songs would be ""Hail,Hail,Hail"",""Daughter"",the wailing ""Red Mosquito"",""Even Flow"",""Do The Evolution"",the beautiful ""Better Man""(I always wondered who did this tune)and ""****in' Up"" Somewhere in here,vocalist Eddy Vedder comments 'pretty good singing...' That's okay.He's right.Recommended."
2,I don't understand why these guys take themselves so serious,"Pearl Jam lives up to there expectations which for real music fans are quite low. They don't quite cut it as far as a band who releases a live album should. They are an uninspired band, and America is growing tired of listening to this kind of stuff. Try something else that's live. Jazz maybe."
2,why oh why did i buy this???,"alright,but not worth the money.im not a huge fan of the band, but ive got a nasty habit of having to own all the albums by a band i like.well, if you are just a casual fan, dont even bother. the studio versions are just as good or better,so get them first.however, if you are a hardcore fan of the group,id suggest getting this.as far as live albums go, this one is awesome."
1,I can't make out the cover,"I guess that's somebody in the band doing somkind of twisting thing in the middle of the air.Anyhow, this thing is a one star because I had to pay money for it. What happened to the thrifty and fan supporting Eddie Vedder? Where's the other drummer guy? Lastly, Stone and McCreedy really sucked for the live stuff, I mean, where are all of the cool solo variations? They hit just about every usual note in Even Flow and Evolution-two songs which bear the potential to let those guitars rip out some of that lsd-driven ad-lib stuff. I don't think Jimmy Page ever played the same solo twice, remembering the song note for note is not genius, it is gumpish. Might as well have been a studio album"
2,MORE OR LESS,"This cd contains some cool songs, but pearl jam is nothing compared to u2, that is a really band. Pearl Jam can never top u2. but never the less, a decent album for a decent band..p.s= check out u2..for good music.."
1,Book never arrived. Horrible service.,"I ordered this book in mid-April and received an estimated shipping date of up to May 17th. It never arrived and I was told to ""check my local post office"". I requested a refund and would not recommend this vendor."
1,AA Lurking,"Be warned about this book. Even though the author has her own organization to deal with various aspects of the recovery movement, this is almost pure Alcoholics Anonymous dogma. It's filled with vapid and inane platitudes that only the truely gullible could swallow. It's the kind of stuff where most of us roll our eyes up toward the ceiling and wish it were over. Meaningless and not realistic."
5,This book fills my heart & soul daily with joy!,What a delightful little book packed with wisdom. It encourages you in a gentle manner to grow in a beautiful way . . . spiritually and emotionally. In a few minutes this book fills the heart and soul with joy because of its optimistic affirmations.
4,Revealing,It always seems to say what I need to hear. It let's me know I'm not alone in the way I feel.
2,Ouch,"The blade seems to be a little sticky, even after lubricating it.Although it cuts shorter than my 00000 blade from Oster, it is not worth the hassle."
4,Pretty good,"If you're looking for a good way to reduce drafts into and heat outflows from your house without paying hundreds for a damper or other contraption, this can be a little messy to install but works pretty well. They also have good customer service. After installing ours initially in the spring of 2010, when the weather turned cold and it deflated a bit and I tried to inflate it some more, somehow where the balloon connects to the black pole ripped. I notified them, and because it's still within a year and covered by warranty, they got back to me quickly and offered to send a new one right away."
3,printing comes off after wash,"The set is very sturdy, however, after one hand wash, the printing on the cup is already coming off."
5,Interesting and Thought Provoking,"This book reflects life from the origin to the present with fishing as a theme. Very enjoyable reading for fisherman or not. I am not into the science of psycology, but am an avid fisherman. I related to the incite and psychology of fishermen. I recommend this book to all fishermen and especially those with whom I fish."
3,Mostly for Lithuanians,"This series (the following books are the Fen Wolf and Blood Wedding) are set in a fascinating historical period, when the proto-Lithuanian tribes were under attack from the Order of Teutonic Knights. The successful resistance of the Lithuanians, unlike the Estonian and Latvian tribes who were conquered, had historical effects lsting until today.Unfortunately, the novels are not all that well written, although some of this may be the impact of translation. Not much in the way of post-modernist ambiguity here - think Balts good, Germans bad (and Russians, too, in Blood Wedding).Readers interested in Baltic history will probably enjoy this series. Others should skip it."
4,very tight,"A very tight piece of work. I bought this album on the strength of only one song 'N Y Excuse' which I don't normally do, but I'm glad I did. Although 'N Y Excuse' is different to any other track on the album, the rest of the album holds its own and is by no means filler."
5,This cd is great! One of a kind.,"Ah, APB. For some reason this cd reminds me of the beach and surfing. I guess it's because I listened to the casette at the beach, back in the 80s, until it practically wore out. It is funky, and the tunes are very catchy. I have a hard time categorizing this type of alternative music, but I can say one thing, it's great! It definitely grows on you. Even though it's from the 80's, it will never grow old."
1,Skip it,This is a rip off. This is a DVD that does nothing but advertise their haunted house. The DVD shows one thing over and over. How to jump out from behind a curtain or a fake panel and go boo. Over 100 minutes of this. It does not show how to make any props. It does not show how to do any makeup. It does have about 20 minutes of news clips about how great thier haunted house. I am not taking anything away from thier haunted house. It looked pretty good. But this was suppose to be a How-to DVD. And the How-to it showed was how to jump out from behind a curtain.Skip it.
5,Hard-hitting alterno-pop package really delivers.,"The Gravel Pit Manifesto is one of the few ""alternative"" albums that truly has staying power in my collection. Moreso than in any other of their albums, Manifesto rewards its listeners with the style of infective pop hooks and concise phrasing that made alternative such a stalwart on the music scene in the early 90's. Manifesto was responsible for putting The Gravel Pit on the national market and rightly attracted the attentions of listeners who liked the energy of albums like Quicksand's ""Slip"", but who also were looking for tight pop hooks, like those in Ween's ""Chocolate and Cheese"" or Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."""
1,"This isn't a book, it's a pamphlet!",Nice pamphlet but at approximately 50 cents a page it's not worth the price.
2,"Low-budget stinker, par excellence!","Mix ""Boyz in da Hood"" with ""Monster's Ball"" and give it a low budget, and you have this bomb. This movie had a dental floss-thin plot. The dialogue is terrible. I'm surprised such a financial-burdened family could live in such a huge house. The villain is a cutie and he does have nice love scenes with the protagonist. That's shocking given that she's underaged. It's great seeing ""New Jill"" movies finally being made, but this one was pathetic. No, those two people on the cover are not even in the movie. And no, there is no drive-by in the movie. Worse, this movie which ends tragically, shows bloopers as the credits roll up. Mess, drama, and trash!"
5,Great CD,"Absolutely wonderful CD. Each track is a beautiful blend of instruments, with the kind of melody and shape that leaves me smiling and humming."
5,Advantix Teal,This stuff works well; no fleas or ticks! Treatments are powerful and can make dogs feel bad. Pay close attention to the weight grouping and go with the lower dosage if your dog is board line in the classifications. Received package as described.
4,good stuff overall,"now the 69-76 Kool and the gang had some serious grooving and playing and they had cuts, but the late 70's to mid 80's era with James JT Taylor got a balance where his voice stood out and they had cuts that worked. too hot is still a cold joint to this day. celebration was played like there was no tommorow,however it helped give them a 2nd career as hit makers. get down on it had a cold bass groove to it. this is a good overview of there late 70's to mid 80's peak and Prime re emerging.they always had good strong production and catchy songs. ""ladies Night"" is still cold. very good overview here."
3,good wing chun movie...,good and theatrical wing chun fighting... but weak plot of course... worth seeing for the fluid wing chun...
4,Good start for the series,"I really liked the first of the Jake O'Hara books. The characters were hilarious, the mystery interesting, the descriptions of different areas of NYC very well drawn. I particularly like the funeral scene in Calvary Cemetary. It was a perfect description of a burial in that old cemetery. This is a good start to the series."
5,Great Manhattan Murder mystery,"As a fiction writer, I find the character, Jake O'Hare, witty and sophisticated in the style of Nick and Nora Charles. The plot is clever and fast moving, the dialogue funny, and the setting rich with fimiliar New York surroundings. I can't wait for Jake O'Hare's next ghostwriting adventure."
4,Magnification of an eyepiece,"The amount an eyepiece magnifies is based on its focal length the focal length of the objective (telescope).To get magnification divide the focal length of the objective by focal length of the eyepiece.A 6mm eyepiece will only magnify 58x for a telescope with a focal length of 350mm. For an ETX-90 with a focal length of 1250mm the magnification is 195x. For the ETX-125 with a focal length of 1900mm the magnification is 297x. Maximum useful magnification is 50 times the diameter in inches. This eyepiece may magnify too much for the ETX scopes. A 9mm, 12mm or 15mm would be a better choice.This eyepiece is meant for high magnification and requires a steady atmosphere. On the few times that the seeing was good enough, this eyepiece has a 52 degree field and offers great views of Jupiter and Saturn with my 8"" LX200 SCT telescope."
5,Short Way to Lower Scoring,"My husband was thrilled to receive this out of print golf instruction book by the famous Paul Runyon, whose short game was incomparable. He had looked for the book everywhere and was thrilled to find it at a reasonable price. The book was in perfect condition, as promised, and arrived in a timely fashion. This golfer couldn't be more satisfied!"
1,Too much tension in his method,"I like the theories, but his method produces too much tension in the arms and body when trying to execute it."
5,Another Maguire Benchmark,"It seems to date that the author Jon A. Maguire can do no wrong whenever he decides to commit pen to paper. Yet again we have a title that is truly exhaustive in it's coverage of the topic without becoming staid and condescending. Each page is full of highly detailed photographs that describe and illustrate the items perfectly for the collector. His text is articulate, informative and detailed.If the American Army Air Forces from the period covered are of interest to you then I can offer you know more words of advice other than buy this book. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have."
5,AAF,"Wonderful reference on U.S. Military Air Corps Uniforms and Insignia. Very informative, great photos. A must have for any collector or historian. Very well worth the money."
4,"As Ever, Gordy",Rated this 4stars for the plot line. The writing style makes for a quick read. I would recommend this book for any teen or young adult.
1,couldn't finish,This is the worst book I've read so far. I had high hopes after reading The Doll in the Garden and Look for me by moonlight. Those were pretty good. This one is about some kid who grandma dies and goes to live with his older brother and wife. He seems really immature. The story just was not that interesting to me.
4,"As Ever, Gordy","Do you like comedy and realistic stories? If so, Mrs. Hahn has the book for you. Mrs. Hahn pays exquisite attention to the smallest details. In this book, Gordy's grandmother, with whom he lives, dies, sending him to live with his brother Stewart. He lives with Stewart in the town that he used to live in, before he moved in with his grandmother. This book is the exciting and amazing story of him reengaging friendship with old friends, and establishing a life in his old town, College Hill. Read this book, to see what will happen to Gordy in this wonderful tale from Mary Downing Hahn. I would strongly recommend this book to any one who wants a good humored, and well written book to read."
4,Rough Times,"The Book ""As Ever Gordy"" by Mary Downing Hahn is a great book. I really enjoyed it. This book is about a boy named Gordy going through rough times. His grandmother has just past away and he has to go back to College Hill to live with one of his older brothers. Meanwhile he is trying to impress a girl named Elizabeth Crawford (A.K.A Lizard) , but every time he tries to impress her something goes wrong. This book is about alot of things tough times, friendship, family, and friends. This is a very funny but sad book. I recamend this book to everyone."
1,half of dvd were ok until none worked,"I purchased the ritek due to a good review. Now, after using half the disks, which had problems with my samsung dvd recorder, I have 20 so far that cannot be recorded. Shame on you Ritek. The disks I bought were the ones you can print on. Too many problems. I will go back to the major brands again."
1,I will grade for 0 if there is,"As one of the reviewer said, the shipping is terrible. When I opened the package, it looked like that it was thrown from the top of empire building. If you like buy a puzzle made from 100 DVD-R, I highly recommended to you to buy this item."
5,Downright Radical with God,One of the best albums I've ever heard yet. Churches are singing their songs. I could really feel the atmosphere of live worship. Definitely a must buy for Christians who want to enter a new dimension of music.
4,wonderfull,Hillsongs bring one of the greatest worship songs for thism oment. I am reaylly blessed may times by this wonderfull music
3,A good collection of worship songs.,"I have to admit that I was disappointed. I am an admirer of Hillsongs. I believe that they are at the head of a revival in worship. I had wanted to purchase this CD for a long time. When I finally bought it, I found it uneven, and its sound quality was inconsistent. The recordings of Can't Stop Talking, God Is In The House, All Things Are Possible, God Is Good, and Shout To The Lord are not up to the usual standards of Hillsongs. Still, there are eleven good song recordings out of sixteen. It is the other eleven recordings that let me recommend this Album."
2,Great music-making; offputting staging and custumes,"If this was the CD release of this opera, I'd give it five stars. Kent Nagano, the soloists, the orchestra and chorus are super in this live performance. But I found the ""kabuki"" staging of this opera weird, frankly. Not only does it completely clash with Rimsky's sinewy, oriental-style music, the costumes make everyone look like overstuffed dolls and make graceful movement impossible -- hardly in keeping with the sensuousness of the score. (Besides, Japan or Mongolia has nothing AT ALL to do with this opera ... perhaps the producer needs to bone up on his/her history to recall that it isn't Russia that traces its lineage to the Far East, but rather the Hungarians, Finns and Estonians!)This opera could really benefit from a staged production that is true to the composer's intended style and time."
1,Versacheck printing is not the way to go.,"I discourage anyone from going this route for printing checks. You may think it is cheaper than bank checks but it is not. I have had many Versaink Cartridges with problems being recognized in HP and VersaJette printers. By the time you are finished buying checks and dealing with faulty cartidges you may just as well use a form filler software to just type in what you need on a bank check. If the VersaInk cartridge fails before the ink is empty they, g7ps, will not give you a refund. g7ps customer service is awful."
1,"Ink was clogged wouldn't work, no returns","I purchased this product for my business checking account. My incorporation took longer than expected, so I did not attempt to use it until 6 weeks later. It would not work, I tried all the suggestions (obviously they have issues with these) and finally gave up. (they use empty HP cartridges refilled) Since it had been 6 weeks since my purchase, they would not exchange the item or refund it. What a bunch of BS"
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT - STAY AWAY,"I used a VersaJet printer to print checks using MICR ink. The cartridge does not work properly and/or the printer is crap and if you try to print blank checks a few weeks later FORGET IT! Found out my bank doesn't require MICR compatibility so now print checks using ordinary HP Printer and Ink. If you must used MICR coding for your bank, consider a laser printer and consumables."
1,Use MICR Laser Toner,"I, too, purchased this MICR inkjet cartridge, but was delayed more than 30 days in installing it. It was completely unusable. The company has a 30 day ""warranty"" and did not respond to my request for assistance.MICR ink is reputed to not be an effective choice for check printing. Apparently the magnetic particles ""settle.""Stick to a laser MICR choice for printing your (blank) checks. If you must use an inkjet choice, install the cartridge immediately, and try to use it up. Do not expect to be able to store it.Also, do not expect to be able to print (blank) checks with non-MICR ink or toner. Some banks may allow it, but many, perhaps most, do not. Your checks may pass through more than one bank, so you will encounter problems. You can use any sort of ink or toner to fill out the check information, but not the routing/information line."
2,"Great movie, defective copy","I had purchased to give as a gift, so I ordered a while before Christmas and left the unopened DVD hang around in my closet for a couple of months. When I finally gifted to my boyfriend on Christmas, we opened it up and popped it into the DVD player. All was fine for about twenty minutes and then it started skipping religiously. Tried the same disc on a different player in the same house with the same results, I have, however, seen the movie. It is well-with watching if you receive a copy that actually works! Five stars for the movie, one star for the fact that it doesn't work."
2,"interesting, if nothing else","A really funny, and similarly disturbing comedy about dysfunctional and the society's needs for labels. Sam Rockwell is superb in his role as a sex addict struggling to fund his mother's psychiatric ward care and find his roots along the way."
2,Sloppy Filmmaking,"People (who don't watch a lot of movies) might not notice the weaknesses in this film. I laughed at times, but in the end, the film itself means very little and was terribly disappointing.If you're a fan of good story telling, this isn't for you.If you're a fan of good film direction, this isn't for you.If you're a fan of good acting and good writing, you will HATE this film."
2,"Loved the Book, Movie Was a Disappointment","I really wanted to like this movie, but was very disappointed.Choke is one of my favorite books - I've read it numerous times. The book is wildly entertaining, funny, and, in it's own way, has some very important life lessons to share. This stuff just didn't come through in the film.I hope the film version of Survivor is much better than Choke."
3,Not what you might think!,"This movie is described as a ""Dark Comedy"". Dark it is, but a comedy....well at least 15 mins out of the 90+ mins is. The DVD is more about the strange & dark relationship between a son & his dying mother. Still, it has its moments. It's not everyone ones ""Cup of Tea"", but to me it was worth watching. Lots of bare breast's!:)I actually liked it better on the 2nd viewing."
2,Gag(?)(!),"Holy foreskin!What a gag! How I gagged.The most honest character in this film first shows her perfect breasts then, later, her perfect understanding of the heart of the Christian faith.Woo-woo!Meanwhile the rest of the cast parade about their various creepy problems in mental institutions, therapy rooms, and a mock Puritan village.Poodle!It wasn't a problem sitting through this movie--it was entertaining enough, odd enough, with some memorable characters. It is just a little too forced, attempted a bit too much--more confirmation to me that many American filmmakers now are just laying visuals on film the way abstract painters lay paint on canvas.More woo-woo!"
5,this film choked out every other movie this year.,"brilliant movie.trust me, i thought it would be very difficult to meet my expectations after fight club. but here it is, another chuck palahniuk novel delivering an awakening to any open-minded movie viewer.Genius Clark! i didn't know you had it in you - sorry for doubting. special set of kudos for the slam dunk radiohead finale."
3,Decent movie,"I like the movie, it had a lot of similarity in the book. The book is much better but I had to buy the movie to see if they capture the awkward moments and witty hilarity."
3,A Detailed Biography on a Remarkable Figure,"It is sad to say that there are not very many studies covering the life and works of St Jerome in the English language. However, the author of this work, J.N.D. Kelly, has done much to fill this disappointing void. Jerome: His Life, Writings and Controversies, is a detailed work that shows Kelly's profound knowledge of early church doctrine and polemic. Anyone who possesses this work will have in possession nearly everything significant to the life of St Jerome and also of the Church during the late fourth and early fifth centuries."
2,Not what I expected,"I paid about $27 for a DVD that says is 55 minutes long, but ends up being only 42:53. This in and of itself is enough to upset certain people. Although I am a big fan of Kelly and his method of teaching I was not impressed with the mostly up close shots of him speaking on the diffeent subjects covered in this DVD. The situational stuff was a mere few short scenarios that covered the last few minutes of the DVD. In all honesty I could have picked this stuff up by reading any article on training, protective equipment, and street scenarios. I'm disappointed by this DVD as in my opinion does not come close to being as informative as the first two. I won't bother returning it as this can end up being a bigger hassle than it was actually finding this DVD, but I'll be very careful when picking up any Black Belt production video."
4,Diddy bag,I got this for my husband for Father's Day. The most important thing for him is that this has three storage areas. I like this because it looks like brown leather.
2,Misses mark,"I am usually satisfied with inexpensive finds and was excited to find an inexpensive leather dopp bag but now I wish I'd either gotten a serviceable cloth bag or waited until I could get a nice leather dopp. The bag gets 2 stars for being perfect usable, but it's a real eye sore and I wish I hadn't bought it. The leather doesn't look worn in a cool way, it looks cheap or damaged, as if the bag is made from leather rejected by a better manufacturer or damaged by a tanning process gone wrong. It also has a terrible texture. If you want a dopp with the class of leather I hate to say it but learn from my mistake and keep looking."
2,Not bad but not great,"The actual kit is not bad, the size and functionality is nice. However the material doesn't look distressed like in the picture, it looks more used and old. I had to send it back."
5,Brown Shaving kits are hard to find,"We picked this dopp kit up for my husband for Christmas. While on vacation, he had purchased a very nice brown leather overnight bag and has been looking for a brown shaving kit as his is black. They are so hard to find that I finally turned to my go to resource - Amazon. This is a terrific looking bag and I'm sure my husband is going to love it. Although it is not real leather, it gives the appearance of distressed leather/suede and is very classy looking. And for the price, you cannot beat it."
5,KISS ME IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This song is one of the best I have ever heard! The lyrics have real meaning. I listen to this song everyday! You must buy it!!!
5,I love this song!,I love this song I love this song I love this song I love this song I love this song I love this song I love this song I love this song I love this song I REALLY LOVE THIS SONG.
5,Sample a little Sixpence...,"""Kiss Me"" is a terrific example of the tremendous musical gifts in Sixpence None the Richer. I've been a fan for many years now and am so excited to finally see 6p get the recognition they deserve! If you want to go deeper than the simple purity of ""Kiss Me"", check out Sixpence's other releases (from REX) ""The Fatherless and the Widow"" and ""This Beautiful Mess"". Grace and Peace!"
5,WOWSERS!,"I'm crazy about Sixpence. I was hooked on ""Kiss Me"" from the first time I heard it...I never purchased it until now since it was only released on single and you know how the timing of that goes so it finally showed up on Amazon and I ordered it. I highly recommend it for all the romanticles out there (like nobodies ever heard this song before)."
4,can't help it,"the first time i heard this song it struck me as trite, but it has definitely grown on me. it brings back wonderful memories of experiences i won't ever forget."
5,This is a really great song to listen too all the time,"Even when u don't want to listen to anything, this is a really great song to listen to."
2,irritatingly childish,"Annoying voice,childish lyrics.Sounds like bubblegum pop lyrics with an alternative melody.Either way,it's annoying!"
5,This song is absolute genius!!!!,"This song makes u feel happy and makes u remember things,u almost sit there in a trance for those few precious minutes remembering times gone by,this song is the best of the year,buy it NOW!!!"
5,Six pence none the richer,"It is a brilliant song and it should go to Number one in US & UK, it's the best song ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Email me at:4rar1@penair.cornwall.sch.uk"
5,Tottally Grrreat!!! Brings Love to my Heart!!,This song WOW!!! When i herard it on the radio all i had to do is buy it. It turned me mental when i could not find it in the shops here in the uk. So of course where do u go in this situation AMAZON.COM. Where i found it. What the song actually did for me is bring back memories of a crush that i had on a girl in high school and i know know where she is and and i am going to ask her to go out with me and for her to read this review. Whoever does not like this song must be a headbanger or a mental nutcase with no feeling what soever. I love this song because the way it makes me feel and i will never get tired of listening to it over and over Again. LISTEN. FEEL FREE. FEEL PEACE!
1,"First, second impression...yech","First off...this is supposed to be a Christian band??? Didn't sound like it to me...I listened to the words of the song and there was no message to it. As for musical quality, I shudder at the sick-sweet sound of it (I shudder while I write this). Bad enough I can't respect the song for musical quality, but when it doesn't convey a message that the band claims to have, uh...no, sorry people. Try Rebecca St. James on for size, now THERE'S good Christian music from a female artist."
5,This song is ALL THAT,"I remember the first time I heard the song which was the first time that I went and saw the movie ""She's All That"". I ran around ragged trying to find the song and finally found it last week. It's a great song. I recommend it to anyone. It's a must get."
1,Didn't last a year,It worked fine while it worked but the UMAX digital camera that I bought thru Overstock didn't even make it a year and I couldn't get a refund. I will NEVER buy another one.
4,What's it about?,"Minor clarification: Hit by Hit was not a hits collection, but was the Godfathers' first LP release in 1986 (at least in the US). This is a CD I mean to pick up, having not heard it since the vinyl. The vinyl recording had that excellent, compressed, punchy quality of the best analog rock and punk albums, and to my knowledge captured the Godfathers' live sound most faithfully of any of their releases. The Godfathers rocked with gravelly swagger, sounding a bit like a bluesy Buzzcocks or garagey Mighty Mighty Bosstones. If all you know is the US-tamed ""Birth, School, Work, Death,"" you should definitely spin this."
1,Pillow to small and not much filling,I was excited to get this pillow as I have had one before. However the standard pillow is about half of the size of a regular pillow and not much filling. After using just a few times it fills like a wad of beads. So the Sabakawa pillows are ont the shelf and looking for a better product. Very disappointed.
2,Pillow was dirty!,"I purchased the pillow directly from Sobakowa's site. It took a month and a 1/2 for it to arrive. When I received them (I bought 2) they were dirty! Well the cases were. They looked like they were handled by dirty hands. Once I got them all washed up, I spent my first night with them. I must say, I love them! They are a bit small, but how much room does the human head really need? It's just the right size. I would strongly suggest buying the pillow. Just don't get it directly from the site!! It's worth it to pay a little extra for a clean product and speedy delivery!"
3,pillow,"The pillow is good but it's small for a regular size pillow. Perhaps I should have ordered a Queen but this is smaller than the regular standard size pillows I have. If you want a standard size, you should order a Queen."
2,Okay for reading in bed...not great for sleeping,"Too ""noisy"" for sleeping for me - the contents make crinkly noises all night long. Not good for folks like me who tend to have some trouble sleeping. Does stay cooler than a regular pillow, though, so that would be somewhat helpful in the warm months, although the noise factor would cancel that helpfulness out, for me anyway.I do like it and use it for reading in bed and propping my head up as it can be shaped well to various positions.It also seems MUCH smaller than 20"" x 15"", probably because of the way the contents move around inside and can bunch up in various spots.I would not buy it again, but I'll use it for reading since it can't be returned now that I've tried it."
2,Great pillow.... but,I really like the feel of this pillow but it is really tiny. Getting a full size pillow would be too pricey in my opinion for what is essentially only a bag of wheat.
1,Small and not puffy enough,I am a fan of this style pillow however i had to order a bigger size ( this size is tiny ) and i found the pillow wasn't filled enough. I researched online and ended up ordering through BuckwheatTherapy.com and ended up very happy! Order bigger and u may wanna order one with more filling so u can adjust it yourself( you can always take extra filling out)
2,I expected a better quality.,I have bought the original Sobakawa year ago and it is much better quality than this. I think it is a bit pricey.
1,Sounds like you are sleeping on cellophane,"Received this pillow as a gift from someone who loved their pillow. What they didn't realize was that they have a cloud pillow and not the buckwheat pillow. This thing is heavy, noisy and uncomfortable. I woke up with a vicious headache caused by several kinks in my neck. Anytime you barely move you hear a the crunching and shifting on the buckwheat hulls. The only way I can describe sleeping on this is to wrap up a nice, thick hardcover book with cellophane and put that in your pillowcase. Best use for this pillow is in a pillow fight with someone you don't like very much."
1,UPS did not deliver this gift,"THis was purchased as a gift for my daughter and UPS returned it to sender, I am not happy!"
1,Shady business,"After ordering two of these pillows, I was shocked to see how small they are. I also do not find them to be at all comfortable.In addition, I was enrolled in another service which was then billed to my credit card without my knowledge. It was said to be a thirty day trial, with an option to cancel anytime with no further charges. I never received any paperwork or future products and was automatically billed by an unknown complany with the information I provided to Sobakawa. When I called to inquire about it, I was told there was nothing they could do and that I was being rude. The customer service rep. then basically hung up on me. The process seems rather dishonest in my opinion.Stay classy Sobakawa."
2,"smells, loud and too small","First let me say I'm sleeping w/o pain with this pillow BUT ...The smell of the pillow is overpowering. The smell, which still exists after a month outside and two additional months in the bedroom, is a heavy petro-chemical solvent smell which my wife can't sleep close to. It's so bad that ... enough said about the terrible odor. Next is the size. It does NOT even come close to the size shown in any of the commercials. In fact, I sewed both the pillows together to get a ""normal"" size pillow. And now last, the pillow when laid on can and does create a creeking sound with the slightest movement including your own heart beat.Overall, the pillow sucks big time but in the morning I feel better so ... take the good with the real bad. Don't buy the Sobakawa, buy oatmeal."
2,"Sobakawa Buckwheat Pillow- Off-White (20x15"")","I found this pillow much to small, nor did it seem cooler than any other pillow I have tried. It might work for a childs head, but very uncomfortable for an adult."
3,Not the best pillow I have but it's getting through my expectation,"I won't say this is a good investment in my part. For this first few days, I totally love it. However, as time progresses, I begin to feel the uneasiness of the pillow creating the discomfort feelings. Let me tell u, it only passed a week or so."
2,Not what I expected,"For many years I had been using a buckwheat pillow sent to me by a friend in Japan. I loved it, but it finally broke down. This pillow is nothing like it as it is packed way too lose for my comfort. It offers little support. It came without a case, unlike others advertised, and I had to pay for shipping. Too expensive."
2,Eh,"It was a lot smaller than I anticipated, but I guess I didn't really pay too much attention to the measurements set out. It's a little weird to get accustomed to because of the material inside it, but it's a decent pillow. Wouldn't say that I've had the best sleep ever because of it or anything"
2,Great in a larger size - don't recommend this size,"Too small, not same size as advertised. However, a Buckwheat pillow of a larger size is great as I have had a larger one."
5,COMFORT.,"Fits your head how you want it. Very comfortable. Since I started using it, I won't sleep on anything else. Buy it, try it."
1,Not very safe,This pillow is Highly-flamable. I dont know how they could sell it in America. It made my head too warm too.
1,too small!!,This pillow is ridiculously small and not what I had thought it would have been. Make sure you know your measurements!!!
4,I Love this pillow,"i have a pinched nerve in my neck, never without neck pain. The right pillow is important to me and this pillow is the best I have found."
4,Sobakawa pillow is great!!!!!,"The Sobakawa Buckwheat pillow is great! very comfortable, just wish i had gotten the bigger one."
5,lcallahan,"I bought this Buckwheat Sobakawa pillow about 6 wks ago, I LOVE IT! I have had chronic neck pain for several years, and have bought all kinds of the memory foam and neck shaped pillows- some very expensive- without any relief, in fact it was getting worse. Imediate relief with this pillow...it conforms to your head and neck, while holding your neck in line with your spine for a remarkable restful sleep. I had made the decision to buy this due to latex allergies, and it seemed all of the high end pillows were made of foam/ latex- etc...or either goose down, which has no support. This Buckwheat pillow is now perfect for both conditions, relief of neck pain and allergy free! Wonderful!!!!"
1,THUMBS DOWN - sobakawa cloud pillow,"AFTER WAITING MONTHS TO GET THIS PILLOW, I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP. NEVER HAPPENED. PILLOW GIVES ME A TERRIBLE HEADACHE UP THE BACK OF MY NECK. TRIED IT FOR MONTHS, THINKING IT MAY BE CORRECTING A PROBLEM, BUT NO ,IT WAS THE PROBLEM. AND IT WASN'T CHEAP EITHER FOR THE QUEEN SIZE. WOULD DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND."
1,sobakawa cloud pillow,The pillow is comfortable but it does not keep its shape and does not stay cool. I have to keep turning it several times during the night.
1,It's waaay to small,"My husband was pretty excited about this pillow because we are constantly searching for the perfect one... This was not it. It's way to small and it makes crunchy sounds if you move around on it. It's like sleeping on a loose bean bag. This pillow was not even big enough for my 8 pound dog, I do not recommend this product."
4,Overall good.,"I bought my pillow a few months ago. The first night I tried to sleep with it, it was tough. Very full, no give and it was just hard. Fast forward to today and it's definitely flattened out some. Reminds me of like a bean bag. It's like a mini bean bag for your head. They're full when you get them then later they're flat. Hopefully it doesn't flatten out too much. The other thing is they said it STAYS cool. I have to argue that bc it definitely gets warmer before I fall asleep causing me to turn the pillow over. Maybe not to the degree of a feather pillow. I give it a 4 out of 5 just bc its small."
1,Product not as described shipped 17x13in pillow instead,I ordered 1 20x15 in pillow and received a smaller 17x13 one. This is not an honest business practice. Although I received my money back in full I do not think this is a way to do business. All Sobakawa pillows are standard pillows at 20x15 in size. Reducing the size means less buck wheat hulls and more profits. But that is not honest.
1,"Too Small, Too Hard, Too Noisy, Too Gimmicky","Yeah, this pillow pretty much sucks. In addition to it being a tiny, crunchy, heavy bag of buckwheat husks, it doesn't even live up to it's biggest claim: ""Keeps your head cool through the night."" I did not find this to be the case at all. In fact, I would say this pillow retains heat better than most synthetic fibers in pillows. I tried it out for as long as I could bear (about 20 minutes) and you can clearly feel the pillow heating up to your body temperature. Dr. Watanabe is selling snake oil."
1,Sobakawa Buckwheat Pillow,"The Sobakawa Buckwheat Pillow did not live up to all the claims, benefits and hype proclaimed regarding Sobakawa/Buckwheat pillows. I was really disappointed in the product. From all of the hype, I was expecting a product that would help with sleep problems. Relieve aches and pains, provide comfort while sleeping. After three hours the first night I ended up discarding the Sobakawa Buckwheat Pillow and going back to my much better memory foam pillow. Unfortunately I opened the package so Amazon policy does not allow me to return the product for a refund. If I had purchased it locally I could return the pillow and get a refund with no problems at all."
1,Terrible,I bought this pillow about a month ago and it is the worst pillow ever!! Every morning I wake up with a stiff neck! They talk about how it's suppose to support your neck and help you sleep better at night but it has done nothing of that sort!! I don't recommend this pillow to anyone! I'd honestly rather sleep with a cheap pillow from Walmart than this
2,Not what I expected,"It was not what I expected, I was thinking it would be like the one I saw on TV...it's not. But I didn't lower my rating because of that, it was my own fault for not paying attention. I rated it low because this is just an uncomfortable pillow. All it is is a giant bean bag. You remember bean bags you played with as a kid? Remember how they were hard and hurt if you got hit with them? No, I'm not having pillow fights with this thing, I'm just saying it's a hard pillow. Maybe some people like that, but not me. My head doesn't sink into this thing at all and it gives my neck a cramp. On the plus side...my cat seems to like it, so at least it won't go to waste."
4,the only way to sleep,This type of pillow is the only kind I've used for 10 years or so. I love how they conform to your head and stay cool. You can conform it to the shape you need. I like that it is a natural product. It is a smaller pillow than most expect but it works great for me. The only small drawback I have with this is that the last one I had had a jersey type casing and that seemed to help with playing with the shape... I like to fold them in half.
5,The Best Pillow Ever Made,This is the best pillow ever made. I will never own anything else. I have had this pillow since they came out over 15 years ago. If I travel I never forget it. I cannot sleep without it. I have taken it on bus trips and it is perfect as it molds around you and fits in the window crack between the chair. Get this pillow you will never own anything else.
1,Thin layer of buckwheat,Only 1/5 of the thickness is buckwheat. The rest is fabric. It is already thin pillow so the thin layer of buckwheat is very thin and you can't use it reversed side for buckwheat. Disappointed.
2,Much Smaller And Noisier Than You'd Think,"This pillow is more like a travel pillow and is about half the size of a standard pillow. If your used to using a standard pillow, your head will fall off of the edges when you turn over. Also, I knew this would have a crunchy texture and sound, but it's so loud, it will wake you up everytime you move. Until they come out with a larger, less noisy version of this pillow, I recommend you pass on this one."
2,Size Matters,"Not At All Happy With The Size Of This Product. I Believe The size Should Not Even Be Carried Unless It Is Described As A Travel Pillow. As For The Money Spent, I Feel The Value Is Poor At Best. And By The Way Amazon It Also Reflects Bad Taste On Your Part To Allow This Company To Take Advantage Of Unsusspecting Customers, Espesualy During The Christmas Season. Therefore I Will Indeed Think Twice About A Future Purchuse With You."
2,disappointing,"Although I am a fan of most of Ackerman's books, this one was a disappointment. Unfortunately, despite having perceptive insights and unique comparisons, there was much that was repeated from her earlier books, as well as a rather dense mat of imagery and quotes to get through. While I might use it to get a grip on some concepts raised in an introductory psychology class, the unending imagery and run-on sentences made for hard going and rather thankless reading for pleasure. However, if you love D.A.'s writing, you might want to give this book a shot."
5,fine writing on a deep subject . . .,"ackerman is a fascinating writer. the three books i bought are all excellent . . . let this be the review for the other two, as well."
2,A Marvelous Let-Down,"""An Alchemy of Mind"" proved to be a major let down. Its sparkling review in People Magazine led me to believe that this would be a review of psychological research written in an entertaining fashion. Neither was shown to be the case. I soon found that Diane Ackerman had minimal previous experience with psychological findings . . . her credit was that she was an English professor. As a result, her writing was so filled with cliche and metaphor that it made me want to vom. Every sentence contained some sort of cheesy word play and nearly every other sentence contained the word ""yen."" I don't have a yen for the overuse of such a word.Part of the problem could be that I have a degree in psychology. This provided nothing new or interesting. Chapters were disjointed . . . simply a conglomeration of a bunch of essays. Poetic, maybe . . . informative, hardly."
2,"Interesting, but self promoting","You expect a beautiful and informative book, and you get a little of that, but you get more personal details of Ackerman's life and plugs for her other books. Skip it."
2,"""Consciousness is the Great Poem of Matter""","I'm sure the author would agree that this is a very feminine book, meant to be more poetic than scientific. The title quote above is one example of her style that took my breath away while reading the first fifteen chapters. However, when I continued reading the next day, all that magic had disappeared. I'm not sure whether the author had lost her spark or if my feminine side had just become saturated, but what had seemed, at first, such a sparkling book had become merely tedious. It was probably me."
3,used alchemy:,"arrived within a week wrapped in a manilla envelope. cover intact, student ID sticker with name and address on inside cover. Probably not a good idea to have personal info.Copy okay, readable but pages dry and a bit brittle. No obvious marks as I flipped through it.Perhaps a bit overpriced for the quality of this paperback edition."
2,DepressingThis was one of the most depressing movies,This was one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. I am unables to recommend it to anyone.
1,"A sad, hyper-ideological film of little consequence","Lots of stilted pseudo-intellectual dialogue. A pseudo existentialist hero. A painfully ideological lecture against the death penalty. Stilted performances by brilliant actors. A receipe for disaster. Why this film was a hit, I have no idea."
3,A good introduction to the subject,"""The origins and development of Western monarchy in all stages from the fall of Rome to the Fifteenth Century,"" and that about says it all. Excellent background reading on all the little delights of nomenclature bestowed upon us by the Franks and the Carolingians. Not ""genealogy,"" really, but you have to understand the history and the bureaucracy before you can follow the relationships and the titles."
1,Does not fit,This is a good product ONLY if your treadmill is very narrow at the top where the lip of this book holder hooks on. If your treadmill is thicker than 1 1/2 inches and the entire top surface is 90 degrees from the top corner(meaning no bump or curve at the bottom preventing the book holder from laying flat) this product will not work. I had to go and buy some angle iron and double sticky tape and super glue (another 20 bucks) to make a shelf on my treadmill in order to have something for this book holder to hook on to. Amazon should provide dimensions so people can make a better decision.
1,not what i thought,"I am very disappointed in this product. Although I realize all treadmills are not the same, I thought this holder would work. It blocks the ""face"" of my programming buttons, making changing them while walking impossible and if I need to stop asap, I have had to take off the ""emergency"" device to get this holder to set half way decent on the face of my treadmill."
1,COLOR IS BLUE - NOT CLEAR,It was scratched (looked used rather than new) and was a solid blue color (rather than the clear one shown) so I cannot see through it. Disappointed. I will be returning it.
1,Treadmill book holder,Was disappointed in this. It is not thick enough to go over my treadmill consequently I have to use a bungee cord to keep it on the treadmill and am not able to turn pages of a book unless I stop walking. I should have measured the thickness of the treadmill control panel and inquired before ordering.
3,NOT as described,This is one of the few items in MANY (we live overseas and do A LOT of online shopping)years of Amazon shopping that I am truly disappointed in. The item I received is BLUE not clear as described. I am trying it out and it works well at holding the ipad but really goofs up my stride when I have to lift or slide it to read the digital display underneath.
2,I'm being generous,"There is nothing new in this Western romance novel: the heroine, April, is a stereotypical-romance-novel example of a ""strong"" woman (""I'm strong, I can do it all"") the kind of heroine who says over and over that she can take care of herself, yet who must be rescued from falling into a river by the hero, and other various & sundry mishaps... yeech, this heroine was weak, not strong at all. The hero is attractively presented, but he's weakened by his interaction with this heroine. The author set the story in 1780's PA and frontier KY, yet basically it brought nothing realistic of the time period into the plot, except for the heroine's fears of an Indian attack. However, there's more menace toward the heroine from an insane Englishman than from any Indian. I cannot recommend this book."
3,Could be better,The author presents the subject in an interesting way (thru a trip). Few good idea in how to make better decision... the book could be shorter though. (Chinese edition)
5,A Winner,I read this book at the library. Liked it enough to buy my own copy. Then liked it enough to give to my clients as a Christmas present.
4,Original Approach,"The tape version (which I heard) may have been enhanced by the reader (Edward Herrman) which had a good relaxed and clear voice. But the way the story goes seemed pretty effective to make one think about the decision in one's life, it made me think about many of my past decisions in a new light. I think I may be able to make better decisions in the future."
5,Westward Chronicles Book #1,"THE WESTWARD CHRONICLES is a delightful three-book series set around The Harvey House, an establishment offering fine dining along the stops of frontier rail travel. Each book highlights a Harvey Girl and the circumstances and situations that brought them to serve at the Harvey House. Originally published in 1999-2000, THE WESTWARD CHRONICLES were re-packaged in 2005. A sucker for the Old West, I enjoyed the simple charm of these books and the loveable characters created by Tracie Peterson."
2,Unbelievable,"This story was ridiculous! Simone, the main character, could never exist in real life. She was way too perfect and innocent to have been abused her whole life. And she was far too logical about the reasons for her abuse as well. I was horribly disappointed in this book. Anyone who has experienced abuse as a child would know that Simone's scars would not be so readily healed, nor would she have reacted the way she did to the other characters in the story."
4,An Interesting Book,"This book was interesting. I have been fascinated with the Harvey Girls for a while, but haven't had the opportunity to read much about them (other than watching the Judy Garland movie). I liked the way that Ms. Peterson wove historical elements into her fictional landscape. The country was a different place in the late 1800s and I believe that this story illustrates that. Simone's father held dominion over her in everyway until he sold her--and even then, still controlled her life through fear of discovery. Only with the redeeming power of her confession to God, love of Jeffery can she take back her life--but first she has to learn not only to trust again, but to allow people to become close to her.A good book and I am going to pick up book 2."
3,DREAM ON!,"JD Marshall is on the run with his 15-year old son, his computers, and his raw nerve - trying to stay alive and finish creating a hot new computer software program. But an accident derails him in Madrid, Kentucky, and his angel of mercey is Nina Toon, a sassy blond pixie who stirs his blood.Nina is equally unsettled by this gorgeous stranger who is negotiating his way into her life...and her heart. He's got the money to make her dreams of a botanical garden come true. But how can she trust this rugged charmer who's bringing strange fortune and possible murder to her quiet town?(The step-back cover is awesome! I've never seen any computer geeks who looked like that!)"
2,LEAKS,"I was in 'love' with the idea of having an Extra Large water bottle for my Bunny Rabbit, Duke. I was soooo disappointed when within a couple of days, no matter what I did, it LEAKED. It just kept dripping through the drinking spout so Duke's cage was soaked which meant spending a LOT more money on his bedding to be sure he didn't get sick from the moisture and/or mold that might grow. It's a good idea but not for this kind of water bottle."
3,Hemline Serger bag,"The bag is nicely made and attractive to look at, and good value for the price.However even with the zipper completely opened it is difficult to fit the serger inside. I have a four spool machine but if I had a six or eight spool machine,it would be a really tight fit.In retrospect I should have bought a bigger bad with wheels as the machines are not lightweight."
1,Item dartboard clock is not like the photo,"The dartboard clock is not like the photo. A real dartboard has the number 20 over black, the one over white, 18 over black, etc, I ordered one and it was mot not manufatured correctly. I sent it back and they sent me another one that was also manufactured incorrectly. They had the number 20 over white, the one over black, the 18 over white, etc. This is the opposite of how a real dartboard looks. I can't reccomend this."
1,"Cheaply made, easily damaged. not worth the price.","I have owned bags made by Beato in the past (1990's) and I still have them around!!! However these are nothing like those ones!!!!! I have had these less than 6 months and already there is a rip in one bag and several holes caused by minor scratches in the others. These are thin and weak little bags. there is no padding, insulation or anything resembling a second layer inside. Needless to say I pack my drums into these approximately one times a week for 4-6 months (to bring them to church and back) and these are not the protection for my drum I thought they would be. These cases are little more than simply putting a handle on each of your drums to make them easier to carry. if something bumps up against your drums while in these cases make no mistake it will still leave a nice scratch or dent on the drum inside. I dunno, for the price I just thought they'd be made of a little stronger stuff."
2,Disappointed,"I was totally hooked on the Men from the Double C series from the beginning. I really enjoyed the stories about Jefferson and Matthew. While I felt the stories about Daniel and Sawyer were not as good, they were still an enjoyable read.Unfortunately, Tristan's story is a disappointment. I cannot believe the same author wrote this book. The whole premise for the marriage is outdated. The wedding was unbelievable, and totally contrived. The growth of Hope unrealistically happend overnight. The wedding ring doesn't fit with the personality of Hope's mother as presented in the story. I still haven't figured out why the birth certificate surprise was necessary.I am sorry if I have given too much away, but I am sitting here dazed and confused. I have reread the first four books several times and still enjoy them. Not this one."
2,Not as good as earlier books in series.,"I had really looked forward to this last book in the Clay brothers series but was disappointed. Tris seemed to have undergone a personality change from the first book in the series ""Stay."" The plot was flatter and not too believable. I do highly recommend the 4 books prior."
5,eye-popping art and a gripping story,"Faith Conquers contains gorgeous artwork and a rich story full of three-dimensional characterizations and exciting action sequences to rival any major motion picture. Moeller's dramatic work is a fine addition to any collection of science fiction graphic novels. After reading this, many buyers will wish to purchase Sheva's War, the second work in the series. I recommend making use of the ""buy together"" savings option for this reason.The rich universe, created by Christopher Moeller, has recently been adapted into a popular roleplaying game, Burning Empires."
2,UNHAPPY!,"This CD is listed as LIVE but it is not. I made a mistake by buying this CD because it is being sold as a LIVE cd, but when I got it, I found out that it is just a regular cd. So don't make the same mistake I had made, this is not a LIVE show from Kenny Rogers."
3,Great Pan...but...,"Nice roasting pan, very sturdy handles. But try getting those slippery chrome handles in an upright position (and getting them to stay up) to lift this out of the oven...with potholders on your hands...add a nice size turkey and it really gets interesting.Like I said...love the pan, haven't quite got the knack of the handles."
2,Not oven safe for 400 degrees,"This is listed to be oven safe up to 400 degrees, but the pan warped after 15 minutes at only 375. Now it rocks back and forth and is unsteady when resting. Glad I got it for free."
1,Hate the wothless thing!,"Firm control, my butt! The underwear part actually fit nicely and are comfortable, but the contour band offers very minimal support and actually cuts into my sides to make a small flap that is more unappealing than a small pooch in front. They need to make it come up much higher and offer much more support. I am 5'5, so maybe if you were 5 feet tall or less it could come up high enough, but not for anyone else. Product does fit true to size, but I would not waste your money on them."
3,Disappointing,"The review I read on this book inspired me to hunt it down and pay dearly for it. Unfortunately it was a borderline boring book that was difficult to stay with to the end. I regret that I can't recommend it as the writer clearly put work into it, but alas, slow moving and weak plot."
3,Interesting first person account of Cold War Construction,"The author worked for a large construction company. He describes his trials and tribulations in making Alaskan remote military sites ready for war or Cold War in the early 1950s. I liked the book. No violence, no flash, just the way it was back then. Hard to find material about Alaska in this era."
3,Not that great,"I think the game is OK, since it's fun that you can choose interesting places to be, but sometimes the game shuts down and at other times it is VERY slow."
2,WHAT IS THIS?????,"This album is something very strange. It has nothing with brain. I think that Vangelis was lost in his philosophy here. Lost somewhere between time and space. I can't describe it with other words. U won't find any melody here, just sound which goes up and down but very slow, something like Gustav Mahler but i think not that good. But if you like dark, very dark mood, buy it then,not my favorite at all and maybe i would give it 2 and 1/2 stars. All that philosophy just because of one man: El Greco!!!"
2,Vangelis has lapsed back into his stupor!,"Vangelis has always been one of my tempormental favorites. Tempormental because I always sweat it out when buying one of his albums. I never know if he has put together a complete masterpiece of works in the vein of ""Chariots of Fire"" or ""Direct"" or if he has dropped into one of his mind-numbing stupors of stringing one or two decent songs together with his monotonous filler and pseodo-operatic crap! Unfortunately, ""El Greco"" falls into this latter category. I think even The Greek, himself, would have nodded off into his plate of paella listening to this nonsense. This one ""ranks"" right down there with other non-notables like ""Mask"", ""Opera Sauvage"" and his all-time worst ""Heaven and Hell""."
2,Hey Amazon! What's taking so long?????,This is a great Soundtrack but Amazon listed that this cd would be released Jan. 22. Why is this out of stock???? Come on already. Get it in and send it out!
4,What a surprise!,"After 1492, Voices and Oceanic, I expected more Latin Chiors, and watery soundscapes, but instead I got a wonderfully mysterious and meditative offering, which was completely unexpected. But what a feeling this album gives! Dark and mesmerising! I have listened to this quietly, and loudly with the Sub cranked way up, and still can't explain that feeling! It is great! Not fluffy and cute like some electronic music these days. Certainly worth a listen, but will not suit all tastes. More like Vangelis's earlier works like Heaven and Hell."
4,Medieval relaxing atmosph.,"At first, this album may seem not so strongly impressive, but if you keep on listening, it will be a revelation. Music good for relaxing and listening in background, while working or reading, wonderful to get asleep! (in a good meaning)."
4,Middle Ages Melancholy,"I didn't know much about El Greco the artist before my trip to Spain last spring when I was fortunate enough to visit the Toledo Cathedral which is a magnificent work of art in itself.(the building alone took more than 200 years to build) This cathedral houses an extensive of El Greco's works.I bought the c.d. when I got back because it seemed a bit obscure and an odd choice for a tribute (?) of this nature. I found when I listened to Vangelis' work that it did evoke the somber (but not depressing) mood of the Cathedral and one can imagine the artist working there and going there for inspiration and meditation. You don't have to go to Spain to appreciate this music, but it did enhance my appreciation of it. The music exudes a definite ""Old World"" vibe. Not for everyone, but then again, what is?"
4,Not the Original Release,"This is a new ""commercial"" version of the limited classic from 1995. Three new tracks (3,5,7) were added for the 1998 version. My 4 star rating is for the new version not the original 5 star CD. I find tracks 3 & 5 to be to light and unfitting. The original version is what I essentially listen to because I ""skip"" tracks 3 & 5. Those two tracks disrupt the dark & somber mood of work. Track 7 however is a very entertaining & inspiring record. I recommend you get it and blend in with the dark mood-scape of this record by occasionally trying skipping tracks 3 & 5 and if you dare 7."
5,El Greco is the best of Vangelis,"Vangelis is a composer and performer of many moods. To say any single album is the ""true"" Vangelis is to ignore the real breadth of the man. El Greco, while dark and forboding, is a masterpiece. No, not a happy melodic musical effort like ""Oceanic"" or even ""Direct"", it is still the deepest composition he has released. This is cerebreal music, not light stuff. These are what the classical composers called ""tone poems"", in this case based on a medievel painter of stunning compositions in his own right. Just listen to the first section for five minutes and you know you're into something special."
3,"Dark, eery... but not Vangelis at his best.","As a long-term Vangelis fan - my first impressions of El Greco were of great disappointment. However, after a couple of runs through, I realised that although the normal peaks and troughs that Vangelis usually gives us were not there - this CD had a massive 'atmosphere'. Dark, mysterious and very ermm... well, 'old', music from a dark time long gone.Good. But lacking the 'melody' and drama of other recent releases."
3,Borders Between Meaningful and Meandering,"El Greco is about as mature a piece as Vangelis has composed. It is not the same Vangelis who wrote the Bladerunner soundtrack although the tracks unfold in a similar way. Compared to Bladerunner, the melodies are sedate yet more grandiose-sometimes, too grandiose. The melodies can be haunting, mysterious and revelatory, but at times they meander on endlessly and even get downright tiresome. Even so, El Greco is interesting enough and can stand on it's own merits."
4,Still had it,Lushly melodic electronic music may occasionally fail to stay in the foreground of one's ear but still should creates a powerfully unified journey.
3,Music to relax by...,"Vangelis is a genius there's no denying that. Sometimes his releases are brilliant and other times they are just so-so. 'El Greco' falls into the latter catagory unfortunately. It is a very pastoral and very slow moving work which may work for some folks while others will hate it. There are no moments of 'presto vivace' on this disc. The music is fine just a bit slow and ordinary for my tastes. Still it is much better than 'Oceanic' or 'Voices', which in my opinion were dismal at best. I am still waiting for Vangelis to really surprise me."
2,Not what I expected,"Wow, this is far not from what I like in Vangelis. The same goes for voices and oceanic. Apparently I cannot keep my concentration on music that has no clear melody or a rythmbox."
1,Too somber and unmelodic for me,This is an album mislabelled; the music does not evoke the concept indicated by the title. Where's appreciation of great painting? Where are the Spanish influences? Did El Greco always live a sullen life? The music is dreary throughout. I have to really work to listen to this CD; usually Vangelis transports me to a higher plane.
5,magnificent!!!!!!!!!!,"Simply awsome...this music will transport you back in time!!! If you cant appreciate the genius in Vangelis, well, you then just have mediocre, go-with-the-masses kind of taste and Vangelis is not for you !!!!"
3,Wrong MP3 download!,"Be careful ... If you compare tracks, you will see that the MP3 download Amazon offers here is for the 1998 version of El Greco by Vangelis,not the 2008 version as listed above"
3,Gets the job done...,"I like this pad, but maybe it could be a little cheaper perhaps? I don't know. I'm satisfied with it, but I'm not really blown away by it."
2,Does Not Hold Up Well,This disc has a few good songs here and there but overall there are too many synthesizers and a lack of decent hooks to listen to this one to regularly.
4,"Not going to be a classic, but overall well","What can I say? The ultimate song is on this cd (I don't wanna go on w/ you like that) which seems to carry the weight of heel draggers such as ""Heavy Traffic"" and ""Japanese Hands"" but all-in-all it's worth the money. Who could resist ""G/B Marlon Brando""?"
3,One of Elton's poorest albums,1. Town Of Plenty - dull stomper2. A Word In Spanish - a nothing song3. Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters (Pt. 2) - Not a patch on the first part4. I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That - Uptempo and danceable5. Japanese Hands - atmospheric ballad (my favourite)The rest is completely unmemorable except for 'God Invented Girls' which is a Beach Boys pastiche that almost worksBuy any other EJ before you get this one. If you want Elton's best 80's album 'Too Low For Zero' is far better than this one
4,"Not the best, but certainly nice",A very good cd. I would have givenit 4 1/2 stars. Tracks 1-8 are very impressive. 9 and 10 aren't very good though. But still don't pass this one.
1,Bad part!!! Ruined my engine!!!! Do not buy!!,"This part was manufactured out of specifications. The bottom shaft on this part was slightly too large to fit into the oil pump hole in the engine block. We had to rotate it with a drill and very-fine-grit emery cloth it down quite a bit to get it to go in. We should have re-worked it even further because afted 5 blocks of driving, it siezed up, welded itself to the engine block above the oil pump shaft, and broke free the ring gear on my camshaft. We made sure we cleaned it and lubricated it very well after this re-work so there was no grit or anything holding it up. It was simply still too big. I am now putting a newer engine in, because it costs less than a camshaft fix.WARNING!! DO NOT BUY THIS PART!!! GET IT FROM THE DEALER!!!"
3,Flea Control,"This product did seem to help our flea infestation somewhat but ultimately, we needed to have a professional service treat our house and yard and are using this product to maintain it."
5,good product,This is good stuff. I treated my pets and then my whole house. It doesn't get rid of every single flea for the whole seven months but it does work well. I bought some stuff for my yard that will help tremendously. It does have a smell but it goes away in a few hours.
3,Flea spray that just so so....,It works for a small amount of time and I decided I didn't want these harsh chemicals in house so using borax now. This spray you would need to use constantly....
1,DOESN'T WORK,THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL ANYMORE. THE TICKS APPEAR TO BE IMMUNE TO IT BY NOW. THEY NEED TO CHANGE THEIR FORMULA.
5,Great product,"I love this stuff. I found it when working for a vet years ago. Not only does it work well on fleas and ticks, but it works pretty darn good on flies and spiders, which I detest!"
4,Smelly but effective,Worked great on the rugs but had a terrible chemical odor which dissipated in a day with the windows open. I would use again.
5,Siphotrol spray for homes,I love this product. First tried it many years ago and found it to be VERY effective treatment to kill fleas and ticks. Use of this completely got rid of any and all fleas and ticks in my home.
2,Was NOT Impressed!,"I was really not impressed with this book at all. I just got a new puppy and was eager to read it. It was VERY short, and I felt as if I was in third grade again, i.e. the book DOES tell you about howling. It says to leave the dog with a favorite treat, or something that you have rubbed on your hands. GIVE ME A BREAK! If you like short books (I read it in 15 minutes) than this is the book for you. I would only recommend getting this if you have another book to accompany it. The price was right and I keep it for a quick reference..."
2,not all that,this book or brochure better yet is a waste of money didn't say anything you could find on the interent for free the only reason i didn't give a one star is because it was well made physically good quality but info....not anything to do backflips about
5,Much more than I expected!!!,I bought this planer a month ago. It was delivered to my door for around $50. I am restoring an old fence and deck at my condo and I really didn't want to spent too much for a tool that I would probable never use again.This planer worked so well that I am acutally redoing all of the fences and decks in the entire condo complex.The people that have complained about this tool should never have shopped by price. They should have gone for the top of the line because their complaint are very nit picky. This is a great planer and any DIYer would do well to have one of these units in his or her tool box.
3,"Good, but not great","I bought the GMC planer from a big box store. When I got it home I practiced using it on the edge of a 2X4. I planned to use it more as door planer than a fine wood planer, so the 2X4 was a good practice ""door"". I found the planer would dig in on one side or the other. I also found the high mount motor made the planer feel tall and wobbly. I returned the planer and bought a much higher priced Bosch planer. I have to admit that I was a little concerned by the unknown quality of the GMC plane, which may have prejudiced my opinion.The Bosch planner is a joy to use and produces great results, but at $45 the GMC is certainly a bargain. If you are a DYI person who is more of a tool collector than a master woodworker it is probably a good deal."
5,GMC 3 Blade Electric Planer,"I suppose time will tell just how well made this planer is but for now my feeling is that the three blades make a smooth cut so for the price it is an excellent value.I am in the process of laying hardwood floors and am using it it for removing high spots in the sub floor.The sub floor is plywood so planing it is slightly crude work so I cant really say how well it would do for say a table top but considering the price I would say, give it a try."
3,Dirty Disc,"Good cast and story line but the disc was not clean. It stopped operating during it's initial play on my DVD player. The message I received when I attempted to restart the disc was a simple one --- ""Disc is dirty"" or something along those lines. I finally got the disc to play properly by cleaning both sides of the disc with a rough sewn cloth.I was disappointed with the condition of the disc.Raymond C"
2,A Masterpiece Betrayed,"Avoid the crude, blurry transfer from Classic Media (the one with a red cover) if you care about cinema. Shadows are reduced to black blocks, and the picture is slightly squished horizontally. Even films of specialty interest can be released in first-rate transfers at affordable prices, as the fine editions from Warner Archive show, so there is no excuse for Classic Media's compromises. If you're going to distribute someone's work, invest in doing it right, adding a couple of dollars to the price if necessary. You'll reap honor and good will instead of shame."
3,Not an easy ride,Where was the editor? All of a sudden the angels became angles and whether became weather. Very distracting. Reviewing from my Kindle. Insufficient punctuation.
3,"The plot is good, the details are lousy","There are so many typos - angels become angles, weather becomes whether, even the character names fall apart - Michelle, lead flight attendant survived, but at the end, she was listed as missing even though it was Ashley who was really lost.Again, the plot is excellent, but the dialogue doesn't follow through, and neither do some of the specifications - look at some of the speeds of this so called jet aircraft - 165 knots?This is the first Kindle book that I have purchased that has such a lousy editing job"
5,Classic 70's science fiction!,An immaginative exploration into the human limits. 'The World Inside' embodies so much of the era in which it was written (late 60s-early 70s).
3,Nice little dystopia story.,Not great. No real steady plot. More like a collection of stories about the lives of a few people from a horrid future.
2,Predictable pap but entertaing anyway.,"Nice storytelling and somewhat sympathetic characters propel this claustrophobic story to its inevitable conclusion. I would have given another star, but the in-your-face moralizing was a real turn-off for me."
3,caves of steel,asimov did this long ago and far away with the same basic message altho the story is different.
2,Slow and pretentious,"With a better developed script and a higher budget, Rodolphe Marconi's Defense d'aimer (Love Forbidden) could have been an interesting exploration of obsessive love and same-sex attraction between two supposedly straight men (Bruce, a French filmmaker, and Matteo, an Italian library intern). As it is, the film comes across as a amateurishly pretentious film with too many obvious symbols (especially statues and religious imagery), a really cheesy score that overly accentuates the obvious and an unjustified and abrupt ending.This is a French film, so its all about internal desires and not much sexual action takes place onscreen. The two male leads are cute, although the character of Mateo is not that interesting or good looking to justify the sickening devotion he inspires. There's only a brief sex scene, and a pretty tame one. The rest consists of longing glances between Bruce and Matteo."
2,Self Indulgent,This low budget self indulgent vanity production deals with a gay film student who becomes obssessed with a straight friend.Shot on video- the productions best feauture is the travel logue photography of Rome.
2,"Ted Bundy,conversations with a killer","The book was curiously interesting,but I feel it lacked in substance. We really didn't know any more at the end, than from the beginning. The writer'(s) were unable to peel the layers and get to what we(the readers), wanted to learn about, or understand,The Crimes!"
2,Boring Conversations with Someone Who Holds a Pysch Degree...?,"They say not to judge a book by it's cover, but in a sense, we must. From the cover, this book looked strangely interesting: it didn't seem like a previously opinionated crime writer's account of Bundy; rather, it was Bundy himself speaking.The only problem is that what Bundy says in the book is pretty -- in short --boring. I don't want to give away what goes on in this book, but let's just say that the subtitle ""conversations with a killer"" does NOT fit well. Sure, it may be conversations WITH a killer, but barely about the KILLING that Bundy did.The authors spend their entire book arguing with Bundy to fess up to at least ONE murder and comment on it; or at least come up with ONE alibi for explanation. He does neither. Instead, Bundy gives a textbook version of what a serial killer would probably be like. If I wanted that, I could have opened my abnormal psychology book from my undergrad psych class."
3,Dissappointing,"Pages and pages of verbatim interviews with a megalomaniac, even one as twisted as Ted Bundy, get dull after a while. It would be a necessary reference book for anybody writing a doctoral thesis on Bundy or the psychopathic mind, but really holds little interest for the average reader."
5,Love my new pearl earrings,Have worn my new pearl earrings and get a lot of compliments. The product came as expected and on time. Thank you.
1,Pearl earrings,"I purchased these earrings for my wedding, but was unable to wear them, since they broke the first time I tried them on. I tried them on a couple months before the wedding to wear to my bridal shower, but when I went to put them on, the actual earring broke off from the clasp. I was not rough with the earring, so I can only believe that they were made very cheaply. I guess you get what you pay for, disappointing but true."
4,very pretty,I was pleased when they arrived. been looking for pearl earrings that dangle & have a lever lock. Very well made too.
5,ELEGANT!!!,my wife loves these earings. she wears them mostly when we are out on a date because it goes with almost everything she wears. very elegant!!!
5,Beautiful,These earrings are actually not as big as you would think. They are perfect size for a conservative and classy look. Difficult to put on for thicker earlobes but overall very beautiful. The crystals reflect light beautifully and the pearls look natural because each one has a slightly different shape but not noticeable to the naked eye. The gift was a success.
3,not sure it is a true product,not sure whether this si a Swarovski product? Usually there is the logo on the stuff and this earring does not bear the logo. So would you please tell me how to tell this is a Swarovski product?
2,Cheap ..,"For $15.99, I can't complain. You get what you pay for.Yeah, they're cheap looking, but they serve their purpose.I wanted ""dangling"" pearl earrings, and that's what I got.OBVIOUSLY, they're not Tiffany, VanCleef-Arpels or BVlgari.If you like ""high-end"" jewelry, look elsewhere."
5,GREAT DEAL,TONER UNIT WORKED GREAT! thanks.good prices too!KEEP UP GOOD WORK MY OH YA OH YA OH YA OH YA OH YA OH YA
1,This is not a Micro ATX motherboard!,"This does not fit my InWin mini tower (350W). Will contact Amazon about this to correct the error on the product description. This is actually a regular ATX card, and im sure it works well."
4,The real problem with the Theory of Evolution...,"... is not necessarily that Intelligent Design offers a much more rational and scientific explanation for the origin of life. As Muncaster explains, the real enemies of Evolution are the sciences of mathematical probability and microbiology. This book takes the Theory of Evolution apart piece by piece by exposing it to the hard light of scientific and mathematical review. As a result, Evolutionary theory is revealed as a complete fraud. Every Christian apologist should commit large portions of this book to memory."
1,this movie sucks !!,"dont buy this movie beware it sucks so bad ... is terrible , I am doing you a favor dont buy it cause you will regret big time you are aware of ..."
5,excellent product,"I bought these to replace previously purchased Gabriels. The Gabriels were terrible,....noisy / rattly over bumps. These struts from Monroe are great,....smooth and quiet. Makes the car like new again."
5,Excellent dictionary,I finally bought my own copy of the American Heritage Dictionary after borrowing my brother's for months. This is a superior dictionary with clear definitions and it is very up to date. I looked at several other dictionaries and this one is the best.
3,Disapointing. But still has some good songs,"Sugar Ray has went down. I miss there hard core edge like they had on ""Floored"" and ""Lemonade and Brownees"". I think Sugar Ray sold out. If your a big Sugar Ray fan, I don't recomend it."
2,A little disappointing...,"I bought this Cd thinking that, after hearing 'every morning' and 'someday' it'd be really good. I was sadly mistaken. If you're not a hard core 'Sugar Ray' fan, I don't recommend it. Mark McGrath's hot though."
4,Different than Floored,14:59 is very differnt than floored.It has happier music than Floored and is more inviting to all ages espicially adults. Every song is good just not one or two.
2,Puts me to sleep,"Sugar Ray's last CD was mostly punk except for ""Fly."" This one, except for ""Every Morning"" and the cover, is crap. Don't buy it expecting ""Floored,"" don't buy expecting ""Every Morning,"" and don't buy it expecting ""Fly."" If you are going to buy it, buy it expecting bland, boring songs that all sound the same."
3,THIS cd is awsome,I gave this cd three stars to get your attention. Theis cd is the bomb Sugar Ray has come a long way since their album floored. Fly was the only good song on that album but know there is Every Morning and Even Though. Those are the best songs on the CD. I did not like all the curse words on their other album. Know the songs can be heard in public without all the beeep outs.
4,"good stuff ""even though"" tamer!","i got this cd because i liked ""someday"" alot and they are opening for the goo goo dolls and i want to know the songs. its a good cd with alot of melody added to the previously harder edged material they are known for. Best - ""falls apart"", ""personal space invader"", ""someday"", ""ode to the lonely-hearted"", ""abracadabra - a great cover of s.miller"", and ""even though"". lyrics are especially refreshing and charged."
5,Immortal classic on a par with Beethoven or God,"Some records are destined to become classics, from Mozart to Beethoven on through the Beatles, Matchbox 20, Counting Crows, Eve 6, and Third Eye Blind. What do all these bands have in common? Cute singers, that's what! Well, I admit, some ""grow on you."" If you want to know who's making the most sophisticated penultimate records you only need to switch on MTV and your local ""alternative"" station. This will give you a good idea of the best music OF ALL TIME--I'm talking 5 star records EVERYWHERE! Sugar Ray is no exception. Just like the Spin Doctors, these guys have what it takes to stand the test of time, but even more bonus cause their singer is cute!"
5,SUGAR RAY RULE 4 EVER !!!!!!!!,"this cd rocks !!! Mark, Murf, Stan, Rodney and DJ homicide are kings...every morning, falls appart and LIVE&DIRECT are my favorites...ALL ARE MY FAVORITES !!!!"
5,Rocks! Definitaly not a one song cd!,This Cd Makes me feel so happy when I listen to it I do admit it seems like There getting kinda soft in there songs but it makes me like them even more!
5,14:59,"This is an excellent CD with great variety. The last Sugar Ray CD was a little too ""heavy"" for me, but I love this one. 14:59 is loaded with some really great songs that the radio stations have yet to discover!"
4,Impressive. A great gift idea.,"Any Sugar Ray fan will really love this CD. Their talent is amazing. This has to be their best CD yet! All the songs are good, and their best song is (in my opinion) ""Every Morning"". Very impressive, and it makes a thoughtful and delightful gift idea for the holiday season. A good buy."
4,Sugar Ray has a StyLe of their own!,"Hey there to those who hate their new songs, give these guys a break. Don't condemn Sugar Ray just because they don't play those 'blast the world' music anymore. Give them a chance to do something new.Maybe they lose alot of fans with this new album but they definitely gain another lot of new fans.Don't think that they are joining the world of boy bands! They are definitely NOT! They have a style of their own. This CD is basically quite ok, the songs are relaxing. My favourites are Someday, Ode To The Lonely Heart and Abracadabra. I don't really like Live & Direct much.Hope that Sugar Ray will continue to have more great albums in the future and open themselves to more kinds of music."
3,Great new cd!,"I think Sugar Ray has really cleaned up their music, and came up with some great songs, most everybody likes. I definetely love their new songs ""Abracadabra"" and ""Every Morning.""They have a great new sound. I love this cd!"
3,What happend?,"I bought this album because I am a fan of Floored. I was disappointed. Whats with all the soft songs? I thought this was a hard band! Floored is much better then this album. However, this isn't all bad. Some of the songs continue the legacy of Sugar Ray's goodness. If you are a metal fan, get Floored instead, it is MUCH BETTER."
2,disappointing,I went out and bought this cd because I liked Every Morning and Someday...Well at least you can say I learned my lesson. ALWAYS review cds before you buy them if at all possible! There are about 3 or 4 good tracks on this cd. The rest are filler songs.
5,Sugar Ray has reached a peak,"Floored was a miserable collection of overdone tunes.. well those and Fly.. However the new cd, every single song is Fly-esque in that they are much deeper in message and in sound... This album is great! Buy It Now!"
4,Geat album to just enjoy for musics sake,"The album goes against Sugar Ray's style of hardcore punk and tones it down to a softer more enjoyable beats.With McGrath's crooning vocals tropical guitar beats and ""Beatlesque"" melodies it goes a long way"
5,SUGAR RAY IS COOL!!!,I LIKE SUGAR RAYS MUSIC A LOT. I ESPECCIALLY LIKE THE SONGS--EVERY MORNING AND PERSONAL SPACE INVADER. THEY ARE GREAT. BUY THIS CD.
5,Sugar Ray RoX and I LOVE Mark McGrath,"This is the BEST!!! Yeah, It's not the same as the previos as the 1st and 2nd but they have matured so so much!! I say the Best songs are ""Every Morning"",""Falls Apart"", ""Personal Space Invader"",""Aim for Me"",""Abracadbra"",and ""Glory"". Even though, they changed this is th best album I recommend this to EVERYONE! Some people won't like it, but hey, we all have different tastes right? ALSO I LOVE MARK MCGRATH."
2,It's not so good :'(,"It's okay :'( I like it somewhat, but it seems really short since they 11 tracks aren't all full songs. The two ""New Direction"" tracks are really short. The album has the hit songs ""Every Morning"", ""Falls Apart"", and ""Someday""."
1,Boring...Sublime is much better,"AAAAHH!!!! If I hear that dumb song ""Every Morning"" again I'm gonna rip my hair out!!! Everytime I hear it, I practically fall asleep. Yeah, Brad Nowell might be dead, but his music is NOT boring. Mark McGrath will never reach the same hights as Brad Nowell. Sugar Ray is NOT a bad band. It's just bad songs like ""Someday,"" and ""Every Morning"" that makes them seem bad. Don't waist your money on this. Some bands that are much better are Korn, NIN, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Rage Against the Machine, and Smashing Pumpkins. If you want ska get Sublime."
1,"Forget Limp Bizkit, Sugar Ray Are the Ultimate Sellouts","Most supposed ""sellout"" bands in the rap metal scene just get shown on MTV incessantly to ""sell out"", but Sugar Ray are different. After wrapping up a tour with 311 and Incubus in 1998, the band headed back into the studio again. They were famous for producing a good metal song with funk guitars, so I picked this up the day it came out. What a waste! There is one good song, New Direction #1, and it is only 43 seconds long! Sugar Ray completely changed their style to easy acoustic ballads reminescent of well, no one. Maybe Sugar Ray won't be appealing 12 year old girls on their next effort, which I'm scared to even call an effort after 14:59. Buy their old stuff if you want real music, or check out Incubus, Deftones, (hed) p.e., Videodrone, or Far. Otherwise forget all good music and turn to pop for a wonderful happy time. Yay!, yay!, nay."
3,dont waste your $,i like sugar ray and all but this cd i bought only knowing 3 of the songs but these guys dont know what kind of musicans they are because they have popish songs to more alterative.i rate it a 3 because only about 5 of their songs are any good.
1,"sad,sad,sad what happend?","What happend to their up beat sound and punk attitude.Theis songs are wimpy no hardcore anything why does it have to be happy,happy joy joy. Give me a break.I gave it one star because of the braveness for them tobne humiliated.Listen to me DO NOT BUY THIS CD."
5,GET THIS CD RIGHT NOW!,"Sugar Ray has put out the greatest songs on this CD, and when you put it in your Stereo, Fast Forward to track 8. Track 8, Ode to the lonely hearted'. It is soft and distant from the Sugar Ray of old, but 10 times better. I would have to say buying this CD was the smartest Musical desision I've ever made. Also, listen to 'Burning Dog', 'Personal Space Invader', and Track 12, New Direction'. Track 12 'New Direction' is 'Every Morning played on a Keyboard with no words. IT'S CREEPY!"
2,One Hit Wonder,"I think Sugar Ray is a great artist, but the cd was ok. I expected more from Sugar Ray, but Every Morning was an awesome song."
3,beach boys/beatles sound,"i do not own floored. i bought this cd on the strength of the first single. i like it. there are some weak songs, however, that i skip. many of the slow songs have melodies not unlike beach boys or beatles songs which is not a bad thing but the cd just does not rock, as a whole. the songs that do rock are weak. it was advertised as having a hip-hop kind of sound but that is just not the case. if you like slow songs, buy it."
1,SUGAR RAY SUCKS!!!!,"This CD completely sucks. Just like his former CD it seems to have one good song that has been overplayed so much that it is starting to SUCK! Also, why do women think he is so good looking? He looks like a DOG!"
5,Awesome!! Awesome!!!,"I love this CD so much it because it makes me happy. All you people who are complaining that it doesn't have the hard edge that Floored did, well, go buy some Korn or something. As for the rest of us, we'll still love Sugar Ray no matter what."
3,This cd is a dissapointment,"If you want heavy metal, get Floored, thier first album. This has plenty of soft melodious songs, but not much hardcore rock. Every Morning is cool, (even though i love heavy metal, I have a soft side too). Abracadabra is catchy and very sweet, and there are a couple good old Sugar Ray hard rock songs, but for the most part, this is an attempt to recreate the success of Fly, and not to make the great music that won me over a long time ago."
4,A Great cd,"This cd rocks. I only gave it four stars because there are a bunch of songs I don't like. I like Every Morning, Falls Apart, Someday, Aim For Me, Even Though, Abracadbra and New Direction. It is an awesome cd."
2,"Other than ""Someday"" -- not great.","I bought this solely because of ""Someday"", which I love -- I had never heard of the band before. Other than that song, ""Every Morning"" is pretty good, so is ""Even Though"", and ""Ode to the Lonely Hearted"" is OK. The rest of it is LOUD, skin-head stuff (I don't know how else to describe it) that I can't stand to listen to. Why does no one make ALBUMS anymore?"
3,Good. Sugar Ray's playing a new tune.,"When I first got ""Floored"", I listened to it and thought how much different the rest of the album was than ""Fly"", but I liked it. On ""14:59"" Sugar Ray has turned to a softer and more mellow sound than their previous days. I like it, but not as much as ""Floored."""
3,It's pretty good.,"It's pretty good but their is only a few good songs. I would suggest to buy the ""Every Morning"" single by Sugar Ray!"
4,A Good Effort,"This CD has some great pop tunes on it, and some pretty good hardcore tunes. Mark McGrath's vocals on songs like ""Falls Apart"" and ""Someday"" are absolutely beautiful. A band that keeps improving and will one day be great."
3,Five Good Songs,"There are five good songs on this CD and the rest of them basically stinkbecause I don't want to listen to them more than just the few times I have heard them. ""Every Morning,"" ""Falls Apart,"" ""Someday,"" ""Eventhough,"" and ""Ode to the Lonely Hearted"" are all great pop tunes in the same fashion (copy) of ""Fly."" I believe the CD is worth the money because these five tunes are undeniably great. I just wish the whole CD contained copies of ""Fly"" because it is obvious that this is the only type of song Sugar Ray can write. ""Falls Apart"" is my favorite song here, and easily this band's best song to date."
5,They have lost the grunge and gotten better,If you liked Fly when it came out you will love this album. They have cleaned up their sound and have created an awesome album in the process. Radio stations may overplay Every Morning and Run Away but getting the CD is worth it.
5,This CD rules!!!!It deserves 10 stars!,"Sugar Ray rules!!Mark is hotter than the sun!!For those of you who don't like this CD but liked the last ones go listen to them! Every song is soo great.Mark has the nicest voice I've heard in my life. The best songs are,""Every Morning"",""Falls Apart"",""Live & Direct"",""Someday"", and ""Even Though"". I paid a lot of money for ""14:59"" but it was worth every penny.If you want to look smart, buy this CD!!!"
1,Simply pathetic,"So, they made it big with their Sublime karaoke hit Fly. What did they do next? Just simply delaying the inevitable. And what better way to do it than ripping other bands as well? Like Weezer (Falls Apart), Soul Coughing (Personal Space Invader), and other bands.This band has no integrity or originality whatsoever. Like i just said, simply pathetic..."
1,one word sums up Sugar Ray- SELL OUTS!!,"When you compare Sugar Ray's first two albums with this one, there is one obvious difference, the new album is so soft. Well, how can a band that played hardcore/punk music all their lives turn into a sell-out band. Can it be the success of the song fly? YES. The second album was awesome, except for Fly. When the band saw Fly being number 1 in all charts, they decided to do a whole CD full of Fly. It sucks. Also with Sugar Ray, all these Teens buy the CD because its cool and the singer is HOT. Now, i believe its an embarrasment for a band that wrote awesome songs turn into another Backstreet Boys. I would give this CD 0 stars, if Amazon had that obtion."
1,Bwahaha... Sugar Ray...,"Sugar Ray is a terrible band... their hard rock is decent, but it would never be enough to equal their success. No no, they had to rip off hip-hop to get to where they are.And instead of growing past that stage like others have, they instead released a new album FULL of songs that just beg for radio play. It's funny. It's also disturbing because MTV plays these guys 24/7.Of course we all know MTV is a piece of crap - no integrity at all. Never playing groups with real talent. So Sugar Ray fits right in.Write me back, please, I'd love to see what all you mindless Sugar Ray fans think.Get a clue - go buy Beck, Sublime, Public Enemy, A Tribe Called Quest, Beastie Boys, Rage Against The Machine, Metallica, The Chemical Brothers, whatever, but please folks don't spend your life listening to this excuse for music!"
1,"A very WEAK CD, but it was expected.","Anybody that has followed Sugar Ray and Mark McGrath for the last two years should have expected this. They have taken the success of ""Fly"" and exploited it. They've traded artistic integrity for commercial success. I knew 14:59 would be nothing like Lemonade & Brownies or Floored after they did a special for Nickalodeon. If you like HANSON, you'll probably like 14:59. If not, spend your money on their first two CD's or another band altogether."
1,"""Fly"" is a poser song and so is this new album","ok lets get something straight for all you people who wait for the radio or MTV to tell you what is good. Fly is the off-beat song on the whole floored ablum. Before that their whole sound was based on the all the stuff on Floored besides ""Fly"". That song is just there and for some odd reason it became a success. Now if you people got Floored for that song and not for anything else then you didnt buy sugar ray. you bought a 1 hit wonder. Their new album is based on the success of one horrible song. Sugar Ray is a bunch of sellouts and i wish them all bad luck"
1,Same boring stuff you hear from any other band....,"I liked Sugar Ray better as a heavy band!! It just goes to show you how much people worry about getting on MTV......they gotta make every song sound like ""Fly"" which is a good song, but I want the real Sugar Ray back!!!"
1,"Horrible, awful songwriting","It has been said a wonderful song transcends any style of music. Take ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" blended with smooth jazz, or played solo on an acoustic guitar, and it's still a wonderful tune. Not with Sugar Ray. Strip off producer David Kahne's (Sublime) trendy acoustic guitar over drum machine, record scratching, and Roland SH-101 bass tones and what do you have? Awful songs. I'm sorry, but ""Someday"" is a very bad song with very bad lyrics.But corporate radio will pound it down your skull until you're forced to run down to Best Buy and pick it up. Who was it that said supply creates demand?"
2,Hopeful but disapointed,I thought this Cd was going to be awsome but it sucks. The only good song is every moring which gets boring. Don't buy this CD
3,I thought it was alright.,"This CD wasn't half bad. It's not one of those CDs that enters my CD case, never to come out again; I listen to it from time to time, which is pretty good because I usually don't listen to rock or pop.Also, their cover of ""Abracadabra"" is one of my favorite songs on the album."
5,A Very Very Good CD!!!,"I only bought this CD for 2 songs ""Every Morning"" and ""Someday"", but once I heard the rest of this album I found out that all the songs on here were just as good as the other ones. Every song on this CD is my favorite. This CD is great for the people who loved to listen to ""Fly"" when it came out in 1997."
4,"Every Morning's VERY GOOD, the rest of the CD is okay",Every morning has such a nice tune.. the rest of the CD is really fine...there's no lyrics in the CD though and i really hate that
3,"Good, but I've heard better","I think this is a good CD (I haven't listened to the entire album yet), but from what songs I've heard, they all sound the same. Every Morning, Even Though, Sometimes...all the same. They're all good songs though too so it's not exactly a bad thing!"
2,Their 15 Minutes Are Up&#65533;,"Sugar Ray busted through the music scene in a BIG way in 1997 with their smash hit ""Fly."" This song propelled their album into multi-platinum status and brought immediate fame. But now, capitolizing on the concept of 15 minutes of fame (which they are so incredibly close to...), they have returned with a watered-down, stale, boring, and incredibly unstylistic follow-up. ""14:59"" brings to light the sole soft song on their previous album, ""Fly."" Whereas usually the record was dominated by hard rock, punk music, this album is mainly light-hearted, jazzy pop/rock riffs, like the delightfully catchy ""Every Morning"" or ""New Direction."" Unfortunately though, aside from these two standouts, the record is much embarassment. The cover version of Steve Miller's band ""Abracadabra."" Enough said. It's lame!"
2,"had it, sold it, don't miss it","I bought this Cd for about 13 bucks and sold it to one of those used Cd stores for about 5 bucks 2 weeks later. I feel cheated. I was lame enough to buy it because I liked 2 songs, and I thought I might like the rest. Someone wrote a review saying 'diehard sugar ray fans will like it!'. They haven't been around that long to get DIEHARD fans. If you want to get a good ska/rap type Cd Please go get a Sublime Cd. Cause the music is way better and Brad Nowell was way finer than poor mark will ever be. (and his music was more edgy and less radio- friendly)"
1,What happened to the old Sugar Ray?!,"I like hardcore punk music, but I must admit that I bought ""Floored"" because of the song fly. I was having trouble finding good music and I lowered my standards to what had to be in a good song in order for me to get the cd. Well, when I heard all of the other songs on ""Floored,"" I loved it. I was so happy that I lucked out and found a hardcore punk band. Unfortunatley, The majority of people don't want that kind of music, and unfortunatley, Sugar Ray new this. So they decided to ""go with the flow."" They figured out that because ""Fly"" was such a big hit, that they would make more money by making more songs like ""Fly"". That is all ""14:59"" has in it now, are more songs like ""Fly"". Now Sugar Ray is just another Teeny Bopper hearthrob band. If you read the other reviews on this cd, you will see that every other one has something on how Mark is just sooo cute and that they love him. It makes me sick that they would sell us out like that."
1,An intelligent review (just to tick you people off).,"It seems to me that we are living in an age where looks are sadly emphasized over substance, insofar as making your way into the top-40 is concerned. Sugar Ray rely on the strength of their lead vocalist, Mark something or other's nicely fitted cheekbones to sell albums as opposed to writing and playing some intelligent tunes that don't have predictable choruses. Yeah, I know guys; it's hard trying to write something poignant when you have the brain's of a welding-bench. Boring songs, boring lead vocalist who's never had anything interesting to say about life and a repulsive fan-base. The truth can be scathing, no?"
2,Sugar Ray/14:59,"One word comes to mind: Dissapointment. A friend of mine told me this is a great album. I only liked the singles on the album ""Every Morning"" and ""Someday"". The rest was just awful. It just wasn't my type of music at all. Hip hoppish at times (vomits) but then punk (vomits again)."
2,Don't Buy,"Don't buy this cd , don't listen to what those other people say about this cd . It stinks, all you people who put 5 Stars are lying you know you can't stand 99.9% of this cd. Like every track other than #2 and 6. If you just have to buy this cd buy the Someday Single it has the only good 14:59 songs on it."
1,This album ...,"This album is complete ..., I use to like sugar ray, hate them eternally. And this album did not ""save"" their career. Their career was going perfectly fine, but the ... in the band (excluding mark mcgrath, I THINK) wanted to make ...music and make more money, basically saying ""Screw everyone else, all I want is my money"""
3,Appeals to the 15 Minutes of Fame in All of Us.,"Though this is not a particularly amazing CD, it is upbeat and appeals to the 15 minutes of fame in all of us. Its a good CD to listen to when you're a bit down and though I don't listen to it often, it's a nice addition to my collection."
3,Big Change u could see happening,"Ever since fly I knew Sugar Ray wouldnt be the same. Am I the only one who bought this album and wondered why they couldnt have made another Floored (minus the Fly). Where did they expect their old fans to go? In my opinion, this album was a big risk when they released it because they had to gamble their old fans for a new fanbase (mainly MTV TRL afficionados). The album is okay, but I suppose if you've liked them for a while you will notice that the old sugar ray spirit is missing and that takes alot out of the mood while listening to the cd. if u just got into them you probably find no problem with the new sound. Absolutely nowhere on this album will u find a taste of the old sugar ray. ""abracadabra"" is the closest they come to it, but even then it's not good enough. I liked some of the songs like ""Ode to the broken hearted"" but u really have to listen openly if you're an old fan to get the new taste."
2,"hey, what happened!??","i am totally agreeing with the last few reviews, i mean, what happened?? when i bought their first cd, lemonade and brownies, i thought that cd was great, and to tell you now-it is their best, but then they started to become 'mainstream', and thats not bad, but then i heard that they were turning to lighter, slower, 'mtv' type music, to get more money from fans, since it would be more popular, you know, like those other fruity sounding groups, and thats what happened... the cd isnt that bad though, but much worse then they used to be, but i guess more people like them this way....and thats my review...."
1,"Their 15 minutes are almost up, and this album shows it.","This CD blows. If you want good bands, buy Fastball or Matchbox 20. Please save your money and NOT buy this album."
4,A huge step forward,"This album surpised me. It's a good blend of hip-hop backbeats and California surf-soul.. Mark McGrath is an underated vocalist and lyricist, and uses numerous influences ranging from the Beach Boys to The Clash to complete an album that is definitely worth repeated listenings. The only problem is the filler, and there's plenty of it. But most of the tracks are well produced and do allow for some cohesion. It's a fun record, regardless. This band definitely has some more gas in the tank."
4,Good,"This CD is pretty good! I don't like every song, but I especially love their hits ""Someday"" ""Every Morning"" and ""Falls Apart"" Those songs NEVER get old. I also love ""Personal Space Invader"" You should buy this CD just for the hits! It's a really fun pop-alternative CD!"
1,So So album,"I was bummed that 14:59 was so unfocused. It felt like they were grasping at anything. EVERY MORNING is upbeat and a complete hit. FLY was the same way, but they seem to be searching as artists. Guys, you found you voice, now grow from there. I hate that I spent $17 at the Wherehouse."
3,"Good Album, But Nothin Like ""Floored""","This is not a fast album like ""Floored."" Nope, it is basically a mix of mellow rock and funk, giving it a more commercialized sound. The 1st track is some great metal, but it doesn't go past the one-minute mark. If you enjoy listening to slow-paced music, which GREATLY resembles the song ""FLY,"" you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise, we headbangers should look elsewhere."
4,"the other side of ""Sugar Ray""","I like Sugar Ray , but they seem to have 2 totally diffrent CDs. #1: Floored (heavy rock). #2:14:59....... this CD has both soft rock and medium rock. Now, I like this mix. Anyone who likes mixed rock- BUY THIS CD!PS: don't let the first song fool you"
4,this cd's cool,"""even though"" this cd has some hard rock it's more mellow rock than anything. its a good cd. its just really good. new direction scares the mess outta me. but the cd's good. period."
1,SUCKS!!!!!!!,"Sugar Ray used be good but now they're sell outs! The only reason people still like them is 'cuz the singer, Mark McGrath is cute! Don't waste you're money. Buy they're other cd ""Floored"". it's A LOT better."
4,This is a very helpful book.,"This book was recommended to me by an oncologist, and I found it was very helpful. There are recipes devoted to foods easier to eat for patients who have side effects from chemotherapy. Some very delicious soups, smoothees, etc. This cookbook shows that nutritious recipes can taste very good."
1,The Cancer Survival Cookbook,"I was absolutely shocked at the recipes included in this book. The desserts are loaded with fat, even trans fats, and sugar. When my mother was fighting cancer, she was told she could have a very small amount of butter, but never margarine. The chocolate chip bars in this book are the same recipe as on the package of chocolate chips only says to use butter flavored shortening instead of butter. REALLY? Use hydrogenated, trans fat instead? And the amount of sugar is the same too. Why do other cancer experts advise to cut out added sugar and unhealthy added fats? Says to mix cream cheese with various nuts and fruit for a spread to use on bagels, toast, etc. How about advising to cut it out? Lots of really bad recipes in this book."
1,cancer survival cookbook...is not what you may hope for.,I have been searching for food to get rid off cancer. There is something I found that helps with cancers associated with hormones. It is a snail called escargott (found in a book: God's Medicine Is Best by L. Wise) you order it and eat it at a restaurant. It really works. I am still an a quest because I am looking for remedy for a different cancer. Hope this will help someone.
1,Cancer and Meat and dairy and chocolate??,"I was very disappointed with this book. Cancer recipes with meat, dairy, sugar and chocolate? Please! We know better than that. Meat is the mother of all cancers, sugar feeds cancer cells and dairy is loaded with growth hormones! Unfortunately there is no option to give a review zero stars!This book is only useful for an ordinary mortal who does not and never had cancer."
3,inflatable birthday cake,I expected to be able to float this in a swimming pool. I did not realize it had a fan run on batteries... so that made it impossible to get wet. I'm still looking for something like this that can float!!
3,Not quite the original,"Roy and Dale are great, but the Mitch Miller orchestra and choral backup are not to my taste. It sounds a bit like Lawrence Welk. One note: I think this is not the complete Roy & Dale cowboy songs album that was released in the early 1960s. The 1963 album ""16 Great Songs of the Old West"" was re-released in 1998 with all 16 songs. This CD has only 10 of those 16 songs, but then this CD is also cheaper. I was looking for a couple of songs (that my 3 year old likes) that are on the 1963 album (and its re-release), but not on this CD."
2,Tumbling Tumbleweeds?,"Sorry, Boys!Although I thought the world of Roy & Dale, this album won't cut the mustard. I only had to listen to the previews to tell you that. This is not one of the better Sons of The Pioneers with Roy & Dale albums. This is one of those ""times are changin' so let's slick this one up"" albums. They slicked it up alright. Slid right outta my fingers and back to the rack.Sorry, but I like the albums that have the ""old"" sound to 'em. Like they were singin' on the trail...not in the studio, with all those fancy voice enhancers. Just my two cents worth.Vaya Con Dios,Sinful"
4,Roy and Dale Re: Songs,It was so nice hearing Roy and Dale sing again. I didnt know that old cowboy standards could sound so good. I highly recommend this album for all Roy Rogers fans.
2,No originality,"If you like the Sons of the Pioneers then you have already heard the songs on this album, proformed almost identically. The only diference is Dale Evans, but since Roy was a member of the sons I guess it should be expected. If you haven't listened to any of the son's albums then Songs of the old west is worth your buck."
1,Mislabeled on Amazon,BEWARE!!! Although this is labeled on Amazon as perfume. This is lotion. I tried to cancel the order when I discovered this on the auto-confirm from amazon - which has it listed as lotion. I was too late to change it. I am not happy with Amazon right now. Hopefully they will change this before someone else orders it.
4,Its pretty good,This game is an accurate portrayal of the actual sport of paintball. it is a fun game but as you progress through the game it tends to get very boring. It's pretty much just the same thing over and over again. The game doesn't really change. It's still fun though
5,Great paintball game,"This game is truly a lot of fun.I used to have a paintball game for windows 98 that was a better game, but this game is good for a paintball game. It's just like being in a paintball tournament.Buyers beware of your sellers, I bought this game and it was guareenteed to work, and it worked fine the first time, the second time it started lagging, and I tried it a third time and it wouldn't get past loading screen. I hadn't taken it out of my ps2 and I explained the situation to the seller and they told me that since it had worked the first time I must have caused the problem. So just beware of the sellers, even if the game is tagged great condition or like new."
2,horrible,"i hate hate hate this game. it is impossible to beat, and is very hard unless youve played another game similar to it before. i do not reccomend wasting your money to buy this."
3,NOT BAD AT ALL,"AFTER LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM I HAVE A GREATER RESPECT FOR TIM AKA TIMBALAND.. HE'S NOT THE GREATEST RAPPER IN THE WORLD BUT HE HAS A KNACK FOR PUTTIN TOGETHER SOME OF THE FUNKIEST , HOTTEST GROOVES EVER THAT WILL KEEP THE HEAD BOBBIN FOR HOURS.. THIS ALBUM DOESNT DISAPPOINT.. THE GUEST APPEARENCES ON HERE SEEMS TO UPSTAGE HIM BUT STILL YOU GET CAUGHT UP IN HIS MIX SOME OF THE BEST CUTS ON HERE IS TO MY FEATURING NAS, SHRIMP AND LOBSTER, WIT YO BADSELF, WHO AM I, BIRTHDAY, OVER ALL THIS IS AN EXECPTIONAL CD PUT TOGETHER BY ONE OF THE BEST GROOVE MAKERS EVER KEEP IT HOT TIM !!"
5,"Timbaland is DA MAN, GOD DAMN!","All I have to say is GET THIS ALBUM. Every beat here is a master piece! Tim has done it again. And his label is goin to be tight! Go Z-Man! Oh yeah, and all u Tim biters out there, I hope u die from da rabies!"
5,Timbaland Is The Man!!!!,"This CD is Timbalands best beats put together yet. The last Cd ""welcome to our world"" was good but this one is all that. On this one he gets help from true rappers like Nas and Jay-z to add lyrical fire to two of the seventeen tracks. Then he has everyone else here as usual like Aaliyah, missy, magoo etc... I thought this one might be a little corny after hearing the first single, but I was wrong. He has hard beats, smooth beats, mid tempo, and any other kind of beat you can think of. This man is the king of beats. His style cannot be duplicated and will probably be on top with this one. If you like his crew ( missy, Aaliyah, Ginuwine etc..) then get this one. A must have!!"
5,Quality product,I'd just like to say thanks to the shipper for getting this product to me so quickly. It was listed as in good condition but it was actually in excellent condition. I liked this CD back then and wanted to get a few tracks from it I hadn't heard in quite a while. Thanks again for the efficiency and I wouldn't hesitate ordering from you again. Thanks from a deployed soldier.
3,Purchased just for one song!,"So I only purchased this cd to get one of my favorite songs which is ""Birthday"" performed by Playa, other than that song the cd isn't all that great. But, I did also like ""John Blaze"" performed by my queen Aaliyah ft. Missy Elliott."
3,"Should've been called ""Blackground Complilation""","Let's face it...most of the songs on the album do not have him in it. He's just providing the beats. The only reason he put his name on the album is so people can get the stigmatism that if Timbaland's names on it then it gonna have mad beats. But in reality most of the songs were either wack, sampled, stolen, interpolated, or watered down. The only noteworthy song on the album is ""Talking On The Phone"" and that does even have him on it! HmPH!"
2,ha ha ha,This album is a shame. He ain't a rapper just a producer with wack rhymes. The only track worth anything on this sorry ass album is lobster and shrimp which ain't go nothing to do with the damn song.
1,This album is so bad it's a damn shame!!!!!!!!!!,The worst abum ever. Damn he can not rap it sounds like he's doing a lot talking to me. Don't buy the album!!!!
4,happy wit purchase,i paid extra for faster shipping but that never happened but everything was still good
3,Timbalands return,Timbaland's second album disappionted me I wanted a little more Tim than I got I love Tim's crazy & wyld out beats but I think he shouldve rhymed more on it cuz thats why i bought the CD
1,he said this and she said that....,"and its obvious that timbaland cant rap. sorry but you can't make a single good solo song, you just use other people to make your songs sound good."
5,Great book for dog lovers of all ages!,"My 9 year old sons and I have laughed ourselves silly reading aloud this book. The author does a wonderful job of getting inside the mind of a big goofy yellow lab. Jack's ""voice"" could fit every labrador I've ever met. The boys could easily read it on their own, but reading it aloud is so much more fun. Even kids who don't like to read would have a hard time putting down this book."
3,ok scent,this one is on me. i had been to store and liked a scent called Bamboo. I thought that this was it when i found in on Amazon so i ordered therefore i was disappointed because i was wrong. My wife wasnt very pleased with this one.
