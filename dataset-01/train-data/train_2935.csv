3,Damn,This movie was the coolest ever There is lots of nudity for all of u lovers of that so its damn good.
5,"This video is worth the money, it is very nicely done","You cant live without this video. If you enjoy the WWF, you can't pass it up. It shows the best part of wrestling in total detail. Chyna, Sable, Terri and many others are shown in incredible outfits throughout. It is definately worth your money."
1,WWF attempts and fails at a video release,"The video has nothing you want to see, you could watch tv and see the same thing."
3,It's not what I had expected :(,It [is not good] because there aren't long enough missions. And it freezes up on me when the Enterprise goes into warp. ...
5,TOOOOOO good,"this is going to be the best star trek & stratigy game out and that is before it is finnished so just think what is will be like when it is. i've seen a heck of a lot of pics and data on this game and if anyone out there thought Armada 1 was good well i say this is 100 times better and with a 3D battle field,ships,stations,nebulae and planets what else could you ask for in a game {dont answer ;p }.this is a must for stratigy fans as well as star trek fansCodiacPride"
4,getting better...,"This game is slowly getting better as far as crashing goes. but it still (sadly) looks a lot like the first game... they have added new ships and new abilities along with 2 new races... but it is really a lot like before. If you loved armada like i did this game is worth buying. Here are the pros and cons---PROS)2 New races)Fewer Bugs)New ships and special functions)Better interface)New maps and single player levels)Has a tutorial level set---CONS)Seems to use more memory, hard drive space, processor time, and zaps more from a graphics card...)still has some bugs on older systems)Has only 3 (major) single player level sets)Seems to have a weaker story.Overall i would say... this is one you'll have to decide for yourself."
1,WTF!!!!!!!!!!!,"How in the world can anyone justify $144.00 for any one game. Especially one that came out that many years ago. I WAS going to buy Armada 2 but after seeing the price.............there is NO WAY on god's green earth I would ever pay that much for a pc game.............It's no wonder Piracy has become the problem it is. I'll settle for the first armada thank you very much, I've seen it for 5 bucks at the game store down the street."
1,It Gave Me A Major Headache!,"I am highly dissappointed in this sequel. The ships/bases are not as realistic as the first game and the firepower is not as realistic as the first game. This game didn't even come with an instruction manual! I love the instant action of the first game but the sequel is horrible. I have tried to give this game a chance but after wasting 7 hours I'm through. I literally thought I was going to get sick. Do not waste your money on this. The new technology and the addition of the Cardassian and Species 8472 is not worth it. The Maps are not even as good as the first game! The 3D view isn't worth it either, gave me a migraine. I repeat, NOT AS REALISTIC as the first game! I'm going back to the first game and I'm going to try to pawn part II off on someone else."
3,This game is ok,"This game is not the best. i'm glad it's out. I just ordered one. It has lots of different classes of ships, and lots of warping your ships around. Also there is a really cool Borg campaign. Besides that everything suxs."
3,Depends on how you look at it,"Although this game has a number of features above and beyond Armada1 it also offers more instability even with the patch(at least on my machine). The warp speed feature is its best in my opinion and it allows for more ships to be built out of the box. However, when you take into consideration the extra mods that can be had on the net, this game fails by miles over Armada1. Sometimes more is not better. I would have prefered an Armada1 upgrade without more bugs."
2,Not as good as the Original Armada,"Unlike Armada most of the graphics are quite poor. The colors aren't as vivid, the animations aren't as spectacular, and there just seems to be way too much to the game. I'm all for having to manage resources in an RTS, but having to manage five different resources which come from five different sources can be pain staking and VERY annoying in online gaming. There is allot more to manage... probably too much.If you want a good StarTrek RTS go for the original Armada. It's cheaper, it looks better, and a lot of people still play it online.If you want a more complicated StarTrek game that involves a lot of management then for for StarFleet Command I."
4,3 1/2 stars,"I bought this after playing the demo a while back. After several weeks of gameplay, I have come to find things that I really like, and I really hate.Like:Better graphics than original ArmadaTrue 3DGood sound effectsLets you play most famous ship classesDecent cross section of Trek speciesGood pacingDislikeAI (both enemy and your own units) is a dumb as a brick. I don't know how many times I've heard ""Ship has entered a dangerous nebula. Ship has entered a dangerous nebula."" even though the nice, safe path is clearly nearby.Species 8472 is too weak. In the TV show, they sent the Borg packing. Come game time, they can be thumped by a couple of low-range Federation ships. What gives?Rescource management is a bit spotty.All in all, this is a decent RTS game, definiately meant for the hardcore Trekkie or maybe a RTS fan."
1,complete waste of money,"don't even bother buying or reading this book. the lesson ideas given are useless and boring. they have little, if anything to do with the actual reading. if you want to do activities that are pointless then go ahead and buy this book. better yet, goto your teacher store and joint down the ideas there. don't spend your money"
2,Routine crooked cop drama,"The first Street Kings had a lot going for it, which made it a bona-fide guilty pleasure in the crooked cop drama, but this direct-to-DVD sequel sadly doesn't. Ray Liotta stars as a veteran Detroit cop family man whose old apparently dirty partner has just been murdered. He's teamed with a young up and comer detective (Shawn Hatosy) to solve the crime, but what results is a whole pool of corruption and deceit in the process. I don't want to spoil anything else here, but all I can really say is that Street Kings 2 is fairly formulaic for most of its running time. Though it does deliver a genuine shock as it winds to a close, it doesn't offer anything that hasn't been done to death within the genre already. Not terrible and worth a look if you enjoyed the Keanu Reeves-starring original, but don't expect it to be anywhere near as enjoyable."
2,STREET KINGS 2,Love Ray L. wanted to see this film because I so enjoyed STREET KINGS. This one is not such a good sequel but it is watchable. Rather disappointed.
2,Could of been better,"I have to grade this movie harsh , because it seems like the made the movie in 30 minutes it just not as good as the first one. Was expecting more. I would give it a D+ for trying"
2,"Interesting, but not satisfying","This movie is interesting with its plot, but its main characters are unlikable and the conclusion is a huge let down. ""Street Kings 2"" would've been better if its main character played by Ray Liotta, was portrayed as the protagonist instead of an antagonist. Another thing that would make this movie better is if it had more action scenes and Liotta's partner should've been the bad guy considering how cocky and irritating he can be.Anyway, this film would've been better if its issues were fixed. Skip this flick, its disappointing. 4.5/10"
5,Street Kings 2: Motor City (2011),Excellent product. Great movie with meaningful diaglogue and wonderful scenes. I would recommend this movie for buffs who like a police story with fast paced action.
2,"I love Ray Liotta, but...","This was cheesy, formulaic, forshadowing, got weaker as it went on, etc, etc. Ray, you are still the man, but don't do another movie like this. :)"
3,Hanging pole not included...,"When I ordered this I expected the pictured hanging pole to be included. Of course the listing doesn't say whether it does or not, but it is indeed in the item picture. So now I have to go out and buy one before I can use this thing."
5,Value for your money,"No Need to Pay More for a decent monitor. No thrills but an excellent picture quality. I have been sing since Xmas and have had no problems. Play DVD movies, Games no problems. Besst $.. ever spent. Buy it for a bargain."
1,Avoid This Monitor,"I bought this monitor in January of this year (2002) at a well known office supply chain. Two days ago (July 16, 2002) when I went to turn it on, there were grey streaks all across the screen. I asked the office supply chain what they could do to help me; their reply was absolutely nothing. They told me I had to ship this heavy monitor back to Envision (whose phone mail system leads you nowhere). When I called Envision, I got a run-around. They wouldn't even tell me where to return the monitor! I had to go online first and fill our an RMA form. They told me that after the form was filled out there would appear a list of repair locations; I filled out the form, but no locations appeared.This company and its monitors are a complete waste. What good is the three-year warranty if it's such a hassle to get a repair. I'm going to throw this out in the trash, and buy a name brand I can trust. Not only is the monitor no good, but the company won't even stand behind it's warranty."
1,"Size great....quality of pictures, not so great!!","Yes like most everyone else I was attracted to the monitor because of the size and the price. Compared to my last monitor which probably had a 16"" or less viewable screen the size of the Envision is much nicer. It took me awhile to adjust the monitor so that the picture was as big and beautiful as it could be. The picture has always been just OK. If the monitor was lined up with other monitors with 18"" viewable screens and all had the same picture on it you would see what I am talking about. If I could go back I would pay more to get the better picture but I would not go to a smaller monitor. Also Envision still hasn't paid me ... in mail in rebates!! It's been 4 months guess I got ripped off!! I will give it 1 star for size. That's it!!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"When I first saw the size of this monitor and the price tag, I knew it was not top quality, but I was willing to take a chance. And now I regret it.After only a few months use, the VGA cord would lose it's signal to the computer. I have to wiggle the cord so that the losely connected wires would send the signal again. This happens about once an hour, or whenever the cord ""happens"" to move, thereby losing it's connection. It is so annoying. Once in a while I get an error message on the screen saying that the refresh rate is out of range.This is not a problem with my computer, because I have tested it on three different computers (2 HP's and 1 Sony).Buyer beware on this one.I will never buy Envision again."
1,This monitor blows!!,If you people think this monitor is unbelieveable...you're out of your minds! It was the worst monitor i ever laid eyes on (it almost hurt my eyes to look at). The picture quality had the same resemblence as a television screen. Go figure! And don't waste your hard earned money on this 1982 Zenith color television!
4,C'mon people...!,If you own this monitor could you please give us some USEFULL feedback on it? OK... it's bigger than your last monitor. Can you be more specific? How about some germane details?(had to rate it to send this so I just went with the flow.. ignore this rating.)
5,Wonderful and different!,"Daryle is a regular fixture at the Charlotte/Douglas International Airport where I used to work in one of the shops. I always looked forward to the nights she played her music and would spend my breaks listening to her. If you enjoy hearing music that is different from the everyday and full of heartfelt emotion, give her a try."
4,An Exciting Account of Crazy Men,"A great book. Reads like a thriller (and, yes, some of the stories resemble horror-tales); the author surfs through a century of Arctic travelling, leaving the reader with a lot of information on these crazy guys who set out to search for the North Pole."
3,"Average read, disappointed","I got this book with high hopes, since it came highly recommended by authors that I respect and love, as well as the Amazon community of reviewers. Also I can relate to the title ;) Unfortunately, I felt this book was only so-so; a few good points and insider chuckles, but overall, the author was very vague and drawn-out in his advice.And quite honestly, I disagreed with much of what he was encouraging others to do, especially if the point was NOT to lose your soul!For example, he makes the case of making your clients happy even if what they want is horrible design--at least that's how I took it. Granted, there's a fine line between satisfying your clients and being a commodity. I personally am trying to side more with David Airey's (Logo Design Love, excellent book!) philosophy--you're the expert, don't sell your soul and be a doormat. Which, in my opinion, this book was more or less failed to do, despite the title."
4,a lot of GREAT info,"The book is long, the pages are filled with too many words which makes it hard to read, but IT'S SO GOOD because this book has everything you need to get out there and start designing on your own. It shows the good the bad and the ugly of design and helps you to understand how to handle it. It is written in a way to not only inform but also inspire you to be the best designer you can. It ranges from everything such as how to find a job to how to deal with difficult clients. Truly a great read for any designer that ever really wants to make it in the design world"
3,"Enjoyable read, but I'm not sure of its practical use.","The book is certainly pleasant to read, sharing many insider information, nuggets of wisdom from many years of experience in the field, and interesting stories, but I found it of limited practical use.Since it's called a ""HOW TO"" book, a more structured and thoughtful approach would have felt more appropriate. Now it's more like an improvised collage of bits and pieces of design work experience.I am still uncertain if this book was worth the money or not :). It DOES seem to have some potential practical use, but... is it really that useful to ME, at this moment of my career? Can it be readily put to use by ME, and how much of it? So is it worth the money or not? I don't know...Ah well, at least it's an entertaining read."
3,A Total Riot!,This is one of Govindas best film and I am quite shocked it did not win any awards because it well deserved it. The songs were good and the title song was the best. Rani Mukherji was good and better than she was in pyaar deewana hota hai and so was Johnny Lever. Nearly all of Johnny Levers films are funny and this film really shows this. I thought this movie was well put together and the acting was great.
3,It's alright - looks good.,"I like the design, very elegant. However, it's very loose. You'd need extremely large eggs to fill up the space. The (extra large) eggs do not hold still in these."
5,A fresh and intrigueing twist on the big one!,"Definately not your run of the mill WW III novel. Muehlbergdares to be different. Instead of a runaway Soviet Union asthe enemy we (The United States) face an expansionist Quebecto the North, an Asia-Pacific Confederation (reminicant of theAsian Co-Prosperity Sphere of WW II) to the West and aneconomically and militarily united Europe to the East.""Jet Steam"" is written in a style that's easy to read yetextremely gripping. I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!I did not rate ""Jet Stream"" a 10 for the reason that a 10would be perfect and I have yet to read the perfect novel.This IS as good as they come."
3,America.....I can't imagine it that wimpy?,"I enjoyed the book for a few reasons...it was a good story and a real eye-opener for what the future might be for our Country if we continue to allow some of our so-called leaders to decimate our military. I will definately buy the sequel, when it becomes available.What I found a bit unbelievable was...I cannot see that in the near future, 2012, that the USA would have allowed itself to be ""pushed around"" by anyone. I was in Vietnam, and I saw US power in action. I seriously doubt there is any Country, including a United Europe, that could take the USA. Quebec? Please! Nah...If Quebec invaded, it would take about two days for it to become another star on our flag. I know I seem arrogant about US military power, but, I think I feel somewhat like the average American and, I really don't think the American population will allow itself to be weakened and then bullied. Maybe the timeline should have been in the mid-21st Century."
5,Loved the book! I want more!,I thoroughly enjoyed Jet Stream. I couldn't put it down after starting it after I got it for christmas! I highly recommend it!
4,This book kick-ass!!,"The reason I purchased this book was because of all the good reviews I read here. Once I had the book in my hands, I could not put it down. I can't wait till chapter II (Fate laughing) is released."
5,Maine National Guard Kicks Butt,"Richard Muehlberg's book about the USA being invaded by Quebec and European troops was a top notch thriller. I liked the part in which soldiers from the Maine National Guard tell their ""LIBERAL PRESIDENT"" to take a flying leap at a rolling doughnut(my words actually) and defends the good old USA aginst foreign enemies.As a former member of the USMC,USA, and the NCNG I could picture this scenario in my mind in which the federal government would tell troops to back down (God helps us).The book has some good old fashioned twists and plots along with some believable heros and villains.I really look forward to seeing more from this author.SO HURRY UP AND WRITE THE SEQUEL!!"
4,Good militaristic thriller set in the not so distant future,The book opens with the unthinkable and keeps you on the edge of your chair throughout. I'm looking forward to the second book in the trilogy.
5,Jet Stream a great book for all who like action books,"I heard Richard Muehlberg on Ted Nugent's radio show and was interested in what he said about his book ""Jet Stream ""I ordered the book that morning. I thoroughly enjoyed Jet Stream it was exellent reading and is very possibly the type of future we can have . In Jet Stream our goverment gives away the statis of super power that we now enjoy and this causes the loss of national and personal security. I recommend Jet Stream to anyone who enjoys reading authors like Tom Clancy , Ian Fleming , or Clive Clusser the action is good and Muehlberg shows good knowledge of current and proposed weapon systems that will be avalible to us in the near future. I would like to see Richard Muehlberg bring out another book as I like his writing style and think he could be very popular if his work gets more public attention . James Sullivan"
5,Only dart book you need,"As far as I'm concerned, this is the only book you need to buy on steel tip darts. Fun read and amazing lessons. I read it cover to cover twice and wish I hadn't given it away to a friend. Before I read a book on darts, I wondered how someone could write a whole book on the subject. Fundartmentals really breaks down how to play and throw with solid theory and good technical advice. I ended up doing pretty well on the tournament scene and in New York City's top leagues after only a year and a half of playing darts, mainly by following what this book suggested."
2,singularly unimpressed,"what started out well degenerated into a ramble with too many words, poor progression, and little of interest. Characters developed into something unbelievable."
1,No.,"At fourteen, Sarah Clark's passion for literature turns into a passion for her English teacher, thirty-eight year old Daniel Carr, a feeling he reciprocates. For months, their dangerous venture into adultry consumes them, then, he moves away, wrecking not only Sarah's life, but that of anyone who comes close to her. She becomes a nymphomaniac who drags down any man she cares about. Then, she meets her first love and their affair begins again, only now it is darker and more dangerous.* There are few books I would advise someone to run from, but this, unfortunately, is one of them. Though well written, the subject matter is sickening. There are no truly good people in this story, just some that are less messed up than others. This is a guide on how not to live. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
3,The Beast Can't Be Tamed,"I am always drawn to books with relationships that are not the norm, and at the very onset of Taming this book did not disappoint! I felt the realness (and the sickness) of the relationship between Sarah and Daniel from the get-go, and a book like this brings questions to my mind about a person's psyche.When the two are reunited years later, the story fell for me. I can understand their infatuation with one another, but the way the two went at each other and felt good about inflicting pain to one another was lost on me.The ending was a bit of a disappointment, but I guess I figured in a book like this, there can absolutely not be a Happily Ever After.That said, I think Ms. Maguire is an amazing writer; her words and descriptions are beautiful and I look forward to reading future works by her."
4,Youth And Sexuality,"""Taming The Beast"" is a very painful book about sexuality and youth. Emily Maguire gives us within one novel a psychological study of sexual degeneration, a morality tale, a coming-of-age story and a whimsical love story all at once. The main protagonist Sarah is on a self-destructive sexual quest after she was raped by her teacher (with whom she carried on an affair for a long time). The scariest element in the book is that that dastardly lecherous teacher actually believes that he wasn't doing anything wrong and Sarah is genuinely in love with him. This brings a sickening sense of realism to the novel as most villains actually do not consider themselves to be evil (the comic-book villains who call themselves ""Masters of Evil"" or ""Brotherhood of Evil Mutants"" are cardboard caricatures of real villains who are convinced about the ""rightness"" of their actions). The sad truth is that, I happened to know quite a number of people who are as blind and self-destructive as Sarah..."
4,Cute toy!,I collect monsters for my boy so when I saw this I had to get the other two. They are very cute and cuddly.
4,"No foam, otherwise great","This is a great item if you want to use your own coffee grinds to save money or get more variety. I use it without the paper filters, they just don't really matter and it eliminates a step. Get a fine grind of coffee, use about a heaping tablespoon. The little plastic top should compress the coffee if you used enough - this DOES matter! Wipe any excess grinds off the device if you're a little sloppy filling the basket. Use the SINGLE cup button on the Senseo. This device does not make foam and it doesn't retain as much water as the pods do so you'll get a little more liquid in the cup than you're used to. It's easy to use, makes good coffee, and I can still get my Irish Creme even though Senseo stopped making the pods! This is pretty wordy, but it takes all of one use to get the idea."
5,Great product and concept,"I have been using this for over 3 years and have been making really good coffee. I use the little round filters that Presto sells - the trick is to wet the pod holder first and then let the filter 'glue' itself to the bottom. Then 3 teaspoons of Starbucks Italian Roast ground coffee where it is almost even with the top, then the plastic perforated cover. The best brew is when the pod is not overfilled, this allows the hot water to circulate freely through the grounds.I then brew the 2 cup mode, add the creamer while the water is reheating, and then brew a little more until the coffee color starts to turn pale, turning it off at that point. I have thought about grinding the beans myself, but this is so easy and the coffee is already so fragrant and aromatic that I am going to leave a good thing alone."
4,Works for me!,"What a nifty gadget! Thank you to the previous reviewers for noting that you really don't have to use the paper filters... I wouldn't have figured that out on my own.The only disadvantage is if you like your coffee strong. Even by packing the coffee in tightly, it's not quite as strong as I'd like."
1,misrepresented,"purchased this product based on the title ""Roll Curls 4in 1LB 24 - 1 pound / 4 inch""Believed to be getting 24 roll curls per package - this is not what arrived; when package arrived there were 10 rolls in each package.Will not purchase from this supplier again, as I believe this to be a misrepresentation of the product."
5,Life transforming book,"This book has transformed my life - the Tomatis method has helped my dyslexic son and led me to incorporate the program into my psychotherapy practice. But please don't buy it on Amazon! The U.S. distributor went out of business so you can't get it in the U.S. at the retail price of about $20.00, but you can order it from Madaule's Listening Centre in Toronto, www.listeningcentre.com."
4,Excellent guide to the groundbreaking work of Dr. Tomatis,"The best books about complex subjects are those in which the author has thought long and hard about his subject. Paul Madaule after his years of experience with the Tomatis method, has written such a book.It is certainly not just about ""Why Can't Johnny Read?"" It is a taste of the cutting edge, without any fanfare, inviting and informative. The effect of the training does not depend solely upon the music of Mozart for its effect, but upon many other elements skillfully woven together. Here you will begin to undestand the process.By all means make it part of your library.Roberta Prada, ""The Ear and the Voice"" in English, and J. Faure:"" The Voice and Singing"", practical treatise, 1868, in English with Francis Keeping, vocalimages.com and voxmentor.com - presenting Tomatis based programs and serving musicians, the creative and business community in New York City"
3,Mat Hoffman BMX,"When i first played the game, i thought it was the worst thing ever. The graphics are horrible... The levels are boring. The challenges [are bad]. Everything about this game [is bad] except for the soundtrack. If you want to buy this game, i strongly suggest you go and buy Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX instead. Dave Mirra's game is awesome and will keep you playing for a long time.Other games like this: Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX, Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2, T.J. Lavin Freestyle BMX"
2,Questionable quality,"For $3 a piece i was expecting a glossy vinyl bumper sticker, like the political ones we see every election season. Instead this looks likes it's been printed by an HP inkject onto large labels. The feel is very papery. However, it was easy to apply and fared well in the car wash.Edit:Almost a year later this bumper sticker is much the worse for wear. It looks like it has survived several summers in death valley and winters in Alaska rather than one mild year in California. All the edges are peeling, torn, or looked chewed on. It certainly does not stand up to the bar set by other bumper stickers that have been on my car for 3 years or more."
3,"Got what I ordered, but it's boring as all hell","I remember this series from when I was a kid. I was huge MOTU fan, and when this series debuted, I was super excited to see a new He-Man series on TV, as well as new toys to play with. The animation was pretty good, but the stories are just boring. I don't think I even bothered watching any of the other DVDs in Volume 2 after a while because I would just lose interest that quickly."
2,Wifi???,"Apparently they define wifi as ""Will Intermittently Fail Irregardless"" as this router claims to be able to handle ""up to 64 wireless users"" but comes nowhere near achieving this goal with any form of reliability. On the hard-wired side of things it works amazingly well and the logs are a big plus but overall a good hacked WRT54G v1.1 outperforms it by leaps and bounds."
3,"good, but not dark enough roast","Ever since Starbucks stopped stocking it's Sulawesi coffee, I've been looking for another supplier. Joe's roast is lighter than Starbucks, and also a bit more acidic.I like a roast where the oils just start to show on the surface of the bean."
2,BE SURE you have the same kind of walker as pictured!!!!!,"This is not a ""universal, fits all"" product! BE SURE that you have the same kind of walker as pictured with the release tabs on the side. My walker has the release tabs in the center of the walker and the tray would not fit - I'm fortunate to be a rehab therapist (who just had a hip replacement) and our equipment tech was able to jerry rig the tray to my walker, otherwise I would have had to hassle with returning the tray or getting another walker. Even with the rigging, the tray had to be duct taped into the flat position; however, it worked like a charm once we rigged it to where it would work. I RECOMMEND GETTING AN ANTI SKID SHEET BECAUSE THE TRAY IS SLICK AND YOUR STUFF WILL SLIDE AROUND AND SPILL OR FALL OFF. It's a shame that the manufacturer doesn't just include some with the product."
1,Does not fit 6291 walkers!,This tray looks nice and specifically lists that it will fit walker model 6291 but it does NOT fit. To assemble you must first attach clamps to the side poles of the walker but the clamps are way too small in diameter. There is no way to pound them on as the instructions say. Very disappointed in the misrepresentation.
1,Tray,This tray is not made for the walker shown on the box or in the ad.Great tray if you want to carry it.
5,WOWWWWW!,"This book was my introduction to Brian Lumley. I bought this book based on the cover and I wasn't dissappointed. When I started reading I didn't stop until I was finished. As a result I ordered the first two books in the series and I was hooked. The Touch transported me into another world, but so did the other books. I loved the entire concept of the series. The Necroscope Series is a must read."
3,Okay!,It doesnt exactly follow the Necroscope series to the extent I thought it would. But it was an interesting read for a little side story.
4,"Liked it, but miss Harry","I was so excited to see a new Necroscope book that I read it right away. I do really like it, but I miss Harry and the vampires. It was an interesting take and I can see where there can be lots of possibilities in the future.Some of the things would be plot spoilers, but I like ones that have continuting characters, which this seems to lack."
3,Skip the last half hour,The music of this production is good and Janet Baker who sings Orfeo is wonderful. The angel of love is a little corny but sung well. The problem with this production is the last half hour consists of a boring contra dance and it all seems very dated (the production is 25 years old). The first hour and a half is very artistically done with beautiful coloring in the costumes. The production is worth seeing because of Baker.
5,Great Saturation,I purchased several different colors of Jacquard Procion Dye. All were beautiful! They were used to dye silk scarves and the color saturation was perfect. Great product!!
1,Not at all representative of Aftrican Cooking,"I had an african friend look at this cookbook, and was told that the recipes do not represent true african cooking. He suspects that the author at with the upper crust of African society, and the cookbook is so colored. In an example of the inaccuracies of the cookbook, Dagga is represented as consisting of dried fish from Scandinavia. The ordinary people do not have money to buy these products: it is actually small dried prawns."
5,keystrokes in the snow,"I am proud to be the first in about two years to review this book. A continuation on Neil's Probability Broach series, it serves as yet another reminder that inidividuals do exist, and provides hope that, in the future, they still will.Like Robert Heinlein, Neil gives the reader more to continue for, if only in the capacity of knowledge that someone can see a bright, sterling future.J. L. L. F."
4,The start of a great adventure (beginning in the middle),L. Neil Smith again proves that rugged individualism and personal accountability are important part of anyone's life who truly wants to be free. This novel shows the trials of a young man who has been robbed of the cradle of a loving family and must find his own life through daring interstellar adventure. A great addition to the back log of Smith's books that speak well of the future and of the potential of humanity.
4,The physiological origins of heart sounds and murmurs: ...,John Criley and his son David have done a great job producing this tutorial. It should be in every medical library and seen by every medical student.
1,"it was advertised as ""New"" but it wasn't","Ordered an ink cartridge from Panera Books. I got my order promptly but when I opened it I noticed that it was past its expiration date. For over a year!! This is a serious lack of disclosure seeing as how the printer does recognize that it is expired!!Hopefully it'll work but if its expired it doesn't really mean ""new"" does it???"
5,Same as you get in the store,This is the same product that you will get from the stores. I am very happy about this product.
5,Ink oh the ink...,"Ink is ink, but I used some aftermarket ink on my last printer and soon after my printer would no longer print (clogged heads)! So that good deal turned out not so good. Now I stick with the branded ink and have no problem. Still get great photos off my printer."
4,HP 02 Prtinter Ink Cartridges,"What can you say??? Ink is Ink. . and printing becomes costly to operates by using it. But, that's where HP mkes it's porofit."
4,Easy transaction,"So much easier to order online rather than at an office warehouse store. Shipped quick. If you must use this product, Amazon is the way to go."
2,hummm,"first time I have purchased printer ink online. Just installed the ""new"" cartridge, printer said it was happy and ready to go again. I am wondering why the ink level picture shows this ""new"" cartridge is already half emplty or is that only half full? Either way for $9.99 (the same price I have paid when purchased at Staples) and labeled as new, I expect a full cartridge. Will not be purchasing ink on line again."
3,"It's printer ink, you pay too much and get too little.","Typical ink cartridge. Overpriced and the printer says it's empty when it's not. Can you really scream at HP when Epson, Lexmark and everyone else does it too?"
1,Godawful,"This description of this ""documentary"" is very misleading. Sex tourism of white women in Jamaica makes up less than 5% of the content. For the most part it's propaganda about Rastafarianism and rather incoherent at that. The thesis that white women paying 35-year-old rastas for sex is somehow akin to modern day slavery is absurd."
4,"If you have the previous version, don't bother w/ this one.","I, like many others, agree that this is the best biographical account of the career of U2 as a live band. Other than listing & describing every single U2 concert known to man, it highlights all of the other juicy tidbits in between. I must add that the photos are also very nice. Unfortunately, I cannot give this second edition a full ""5 stars"" because it seems as though it was published too early. The stuff on PopMart is only the first five shows, so the PopMart info is virtually nothing special. If you you have the old one, save your money; if you don't, might as well buy this one! I don't know why Pimm couldn't have waited out the rest of the tour."
4,4 &1/2 stars,"The setlist itself is great. There are a couple songs where the sound mix is a little off and the vocals are a little buried because of it. Other than that though, it's an awesome set and i highly recommend it."
5,Very Swampeast Missouri!,This is the sound I grew up with. It's like not knowing you have an accent!This album makes you giggle while negotiating bad traffic! Go Bottle Rockets!
4,Great book,I look forward to the next installment of the series. I've read all of Tim's fictional works and really enjoy his stories.
2,viking II,"Good story al little slow, I kept waiting for the book to pull me in but insead it left me wanting more."
3,Left me curious,"Well, I've just finished this book and I found myself wanting to buy the 2nd in the trilogy just because not much happened in this one. The multiple characters are sometimes hard to follow and the story is a more like a journal as stated in the prologue. I'll know more when I finish the 2nd."
3,NOT VERY CLEAR,"I bought this book on account of people’s stories of overcoming diseases through a change of food habits, as well as the author’s own story concerning a cancer overcoming and healing. At the end, I found that the stories don’t tell much so short they are and the author's own story is also somewhat not very clear for me with regard to curing a cancer. To be short, at the very end, it is all too common and similar to other books of the same style. Recipes are reasonable."
4,duel purpose,"This is OK for the skin although it absorbs slower that others. What really makes me like it is the way it makes the furniture look on my rifles, shotguns and hand guns. While it may darken very light and dry leather it really gives it a suppleness. Untreaded or older wood forends and stocks get a subtle smoothness and make the wood look rich and not just shiney, expecially wood grips on hand guns. its the bees wax. A little goes a long way. PROVE ME WRONG!"
3,Soso product with wired smell,"It works, but not in a very impressive way. It's hard to rub onto hands, and doesn't last for very long. The smell is very wired. I bought this because I am pregnant and want to use healthy organic product, just in case my hand balm/lotion accidently ends in my mouth. Now this smell makes me sick, so I may stop using it. However, I showed it to some other friends who are not pregnant, they all agree that the smell is annoying."
2,love the product hate the price,over $5 cheaper per LARGER tin at Cracker Barrel stores. Next time i will buy it there and not here.
1,Too greasy,"I sent this to my brother in Colorado, who works outside around water and so his hands crack and bleed. After reading the reviews I thought this might be good fir his hands to try to heal them at night. He said the product left his hands so greasy it soaked through the gloves (I also sent him) but didn't seem to penetrate his hands at all, just stayed on the surface of his hands and wouldn't absorb."
2,I really want to love it.....,"I bought some of this in person without reading or looking at product reviews. I have very dry cracked hands from frequent hand washing so I needed something heavy duty. I saw this and thought it would be perfect as it's a balm and it would fit in my purse so I could use it after washing my hands in public. It is greasy but not bad and soaks in after awhile, it just does not help my poor cracked hands much. It does help a little and my healthy skin is softer but it's not doing enough for my chapped painful skin on my hands. I use it several times a day and have so for a few weeks. I was really surprised to see it have such a high rating on amazon as it did not help me much."
2,what a waste of money...,It made my hands smell so manly. I could't get enough on my hands or get it to go in my hands. It makes my hands shiny and greasy but still feeling not moisturized. My hands were covered in a thin layer of it just sitting on top. From all the great reviews i thought it'd be wonderful but I was so wrong. It could work for others! My skin could just be an exception.
5,It definitely helps!,"After trying many creams, balms etc for cracked fingers, this one does seem to help. Unlike one of the others that I use as well, this one is much greasier, but does go away after about 10 minutes. If you suffer from the same, you should give this one a try!"
5,Charlie does it again...and then some!,"I have been a fan of Charlie's music for 20 years, and this album blows them all away. Kind of a greatest hits album, kind of a tribute album. Charlie calls on many of his old friends, including Steve Taylor, Brent Borgouis, Sixpence none the Richer, the 77's and many more, to rework some his best songs. Stand outs include Steve Taylor and Margaret Becker rocking out with Charlie on the 1984 track ""Lie Down In The Grass"", and Sixence None the Richer joining Charlie on the Amy Grant hit ""Every Heartbeat"" (Which Charlie wrote). The two new songs are great too. A must for all Charlie fans, or a good place to start if you like great Christian music."
4,An album recorded by only five lives,"NINE LIVES marks the once-disbanded Aerosmith's triumphant return to Columbia Records. This is their first Columbia Records release since 1980's AEROSMITH'S GREATEST HITS. I suppose when the band's contract with Geffen Records expired in 1994 or '95,it was never renewed. The CD booklet contains only sample lyrics of every song. The booklet also has some animation in it,looking like it was done by an amateur. One of the best albums of the nineties."
5,WOW!,"WOW! this CD is awsome!!! My best friend recommended to me, and I wasn't sure, but this CD is great, specially for hole in my soul and Pink, which are superb!!!"
3,Just Not Aerosmith Enough For Me!,This cd was just not one of my favorites! It seemed to me like they were tryin' to change & do what other people were doin' & not makin' their oun kind of music!Don't get me wrong anything by Aerosmith kicks ass but this was not my favorite!
2,...or rather 1.5 stars...,"I'm disappointed! Aerosmith seem to believe they're taking a (musically) step forward and perhaps they are. But I rather listen to ""Permanent vacation"", ""Pump"", and ""Get a grip"". I won't deny that ""Falling in love"" is a great song in the old (?) Aerosmith tradition but the rest isn't good. After a while Tyler's voice is really annoying."
2,I'm sorry to disagree....,"I'm sorry to disagree, but at this stage of this career Aerosmith simply don't have the creativity to release FIFTEEN new songs in an album ! The result is that the CD is toomuch irregular, with too much high lows, and ends up being a very boring aquisition."
1,Please Retire,"This album is completely embarrassing and only a *little* bit better than their worst album, Get A Grip.This sounds SO flat and tired. The lyrics are crap (I still gag when I hear the whole ""crayon/lay on"" rhyme in the awful ""Pink"")and the music is totally uninspired and uninteresting.To hear the REAL Aerosmith, listen to anything PRE Done With Mirrors....and only Pump is worthy after that.This one is just horrible."
5,Best Racing Game Since the Gran Turismo Series,"I originally played the demo from the fast and the furious DVD, i went out and bought it the the next day. It is an Activision Classic."
2,blah,"All I can say is you can take overlay graphics that looks like a cartoon from disney, a shortage of competitive cars, boring races, and a hard to understand interface and you just feel like you don't want to bother earning all the extras. The race would put you to sleep, if it wasn't for the soundtrack which is the only part of the game that doesn't feel fake or boring. The music is so good that I added a star to the rating just because it is so good. As for the game, I got it for christmas this year, and I have played it for a total of an hour and a half and I haven't since."
5,Couple Questions Though that will make it better,I have the fast and the furious dvd and i wanted to know if you could actually play the supercar street challenge or just watch it. Also does this game have parts like (nos)nitrous ox side and turbos. And one other thing! is this game compatible with race wheels> PLEASE WRITE BACK AND TELL ME- PLEASE
1,Supercar Street Challenge,This is so bad - I played this game for 10 minutes the day i bought it.Never played again. What a waste of money.
4,A Neglected Masterpiece,"Paul Cook's mission seems to be to fool the reader. Just when you think you know what's going on, he pulls a switcheroo. Along the way he cajoles the reader with a fluid writing style and interesting visions of the future. I liked the Clantrams the best. I could have seen more of them. But, really, at heart, this book is a love story and, in the end, it works. More people should read Cook's books. Only his apparent lack of ambition is holding him back."
2,Typical 80's sci-fi,"This book, while hinting at a golden age plot, really falls back on a very cliched plot device. It was rather interesting to see the way he ignores physics and the reality of machine degradation (mid 80's technology still operational 1000 years in the future) in a way that the golden age writers used to do, but the resolution was a copout that anyone familiar with science fiction will see coming from the first chapter. If he'd just ended the book without falling back on his initial storyline it would have rated an extra star just for the memories it evoked."
4,Good Blade,These blades work way better than the alligator or some such mulching blades we had on before that shook the life out of our lawnmower.
3,Annh...really not so bad,"I bought this CD at a local music store for two dollars, mostly because I thought the cover art looked interesting (my critical method of choosing between hundreds of discounted little-known CDs). Considering I'd never heard of Dorian Gray before, they didn't prove to be a disappointment; the majority of the songs are consistently upbeat and, while definitely not standout-ish or provocative, it makes for nice mindless background tunes. My favorite so far is the really cheesy ""We Could Be Stars,"" which has a particularly catchy-sounding refrain."
2,Nonstick Coating Peels Quickly!,"I bought this pan no more than six months ago and the nonstick coating is already peeling off! I tried to find a way to contact the company that makes this product, but couldn't find any info other than here. I was really disappointed with this product. I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone that cooks on a regular basis."
3,It works but not an exact fit,"If you are restoring a Cadillac Eldorado for car shows, be warned this is not a 100% replacement. It will work for a daily driver but it might be noticed by car enthusiasts. It doesn't quite fit the way the original did so it may not work for you. It's a good radiator and all and it will work to get you on the road again no doubt."
4,Great Movie!,"Loving the Death Race series, starting with Death Race 2000, I was skeptical about a sequel as most movies fail to match or beat the predecessors. After watching this movie I came away very happy.For those who don't know, this is a prequel of the series. In this movie they clue you in on how it all started and how Frankenstein came to be.I bought this elsewhere and paid more to do so... would definitely recommend you buy it from here."
2,lacking in scope and actors,They ruined the chance for a good come back to the original Death Race that was a excellent movie but when you change actors and cast you get the kind of movie of the number 2 sequeli wouldnt buy this again.
4,Franknstein is back,"I thought of giving it a 3 stars in the beginning. But I did enjoy the movie and didn't look at how much time is left for the movie to end. I really enjoyed it. It had some twist close to the end which made me question if the hero prisoner will ever survive. Basically I saw him dying twice. So I was unsure if he'd ever make it. But whether he lived afterwards or not, is for you to see. It's a good movie and it is different from the first ''death race'' movie. But I can't say I didn't enjoy it. It surprisingly kept me on my seat. What I wish was different is a longer ending, to see a little more details and a little more story. I would consider watching it again."
3,ok,"Jason Statham would have been nice to see. It's pretty good though, uses much of the same ideas as the first one. In this genre of film though, it's forgettable. I don't recommend buying it over other excellent movies of this type."
3,should have made this one first,"should have made this one first, as a second, you can figure out what going to happen three days in advance. race scenes are the same and no better than the first movie, almost boring. AFTER WATCHING second or third time it got better"
3,Death Race 2,"Not like the original, more of a re-cooked imitation--no Jason Statham, no Amy Smart in this one, but okay action."
1,Typical Hollywood movie!,Just finished this movie and am not impressed.The usual T and A girly show.I must say that I do enjoy Luke Goss and his acting ability though.
3,SO - SO,This secong edition of DEATH RACE was not as good as the first one. I just did not seem to like this one as good as the first one.
4,sad sad world of hollywood,"This used to be my favorite book to cuddle up with at night when all was quiet.This is a picture/dialogue book you can really et lost in. We all like watching the old movies and this book features all the places the stars lived in their heydays in Hollywood.. Personally I find this book bittersweet and wistful.Its so sad to see how the stars struggled and often died tragically in their quest to bask in the limelight. Of all the books I have ever read on Hollywood this was is my favorite.After reading I always ask myself, "" was all the stars chronicaled in this book struggles to make the ""big time"" worth their pain and suffering?This book really makes you wonder if it was."
3,New powder coating technology,"I am working as a raw material distributor and as a technical service man to the powder coating manufacturers. Therefore, I really need a lot of info related to the manufacturing of powder coatings and it's technology as well so that it would be very much convenient for me to work for those customer.Friendly speaking, I really want to have the book but I can not affort to buy.Is there any way you can help me to get the book?"
3,"Transcribed from NPR ""American Song"" with Alec Wilder","If there are any David ""Allen"" fans from his days with World Pacific records in the late 50's and early 60's, if there are any of you out there, this CD is not up to the quality of his work on World Pacific and other labels during that time. He did an album in 1959 with conductor Johnny Mandel of all Jerome Kern tunes. What an excellent piece of work it was: Unfortunately, not avaliable on CD. David Allen was voted as the top ballad singer on the Playboy jazz poll during that time.This current CD is taken from broadcasts he did with Alec Wilder on National Public Radio on his show ""The American Song."" Wilder later wrote an excellent book based on this 1970's program. He does some of the great American standard songs, but the production values are not up to the standard he previously set with World Pacific.The very fact that you are even reading this review means that have good taste in music."
3,Former vocalists for Jack Teagarden's orchestra.,"In the 40's he was Jack Teagarden's vocalists, when Teagarden has his big band, in theses sessions, Allyn is a little past his prime, but since it's all that's available(on CD that is) it's a good place to start."
1,sloppy workmanship,If I wern't so handy Horizon would have had to send a represenatative to my home in order to put this unit together. All bolts were very hard to secure and felt as though they were cross threaded. Some bolt holes did not line up and in two instasnces I had to drill through the steel to make them .And when I finally got it together it would not operate as a connector in the circuit board was not pluggerd in.Also the wrong parts were sent in one of the hardware packages.Do yourself a big favor DON'T buy this product!!!!!
4,"Nice treadmill for price, with painful assembly","The T71 is a great treadmill under $700, but assembly was a nightmare. Can you say Quality Control? None of the holes lined up properly. The instructions were so-so, and it was a nightmare all together. Once we got it together it was golden."
3,Operetta excerpts,The operettas excerpted here are charming and make you wish that these pieces were available uncut. Rudolph Schock is wonderful as usual.
1,Not quite impressed.,I was expecting a fondue pot. This was merely 2 cheap metal cups in a cheap warmer. Not impressed.
5,Love it!,I really like the Chocolatiere. I make alot of candy and it works perfect for melting chocolate to just the right temp and hold it. I have also given one as a gift and will buy another for a Christmas gift.
3,Not what i expected,"The item description DID NOT say what the size of the pots were. When received, very disappointed how small they were. Thought they would be bigger. My wife has a single pot and i thought they would each be at least as big as the one she had but they were not. All the extra accessories that came with it were a nice bonus that i didn't know was included. That also was not in the item description. A lot of these items being sold need more description."
4,Fondue pot,I ordered this for my daughter for her birthday. Received in Excellent condition and cute. She hasnt had a chance to use it yet.
1,Cheap Knockoff,I ordered 3 green mesh John Deere Trucker hats as gifts. They were of poor quality and fell apart within the first month of regular use. I feel embarrassed for ever giving them as gifts. Never again.
3,John deere Cap,The cap and color was great and so was the fit. I felt like in all with the shipping the cap was priced to high!
2,False advertisment,"Title advertises ""over 3,100 color patches and tabs covering:....U.S. Air Force....Wrong! There is a small chapter dealing with the Army Air Force (WWII), but not the U.S. Air Force.This book is almost entirely about U.S. Army and Marine Corps patches.There are over 100 patches and tabs used by the U.S. Air Force past and present, and NONE are included in this book! The main reason I purchased it was for the histories of the Air Force patches. I am disappointed in amazon.com in allowing this false/misleading advertising on this book. Tim Burgess"
4,Good Reference,The newest release of this book includes patches relevent to the War in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as some of the new units and organizations being organized in the United States. A good book to leaf through!
5,Tired of Being Tired: Overcoming Chronic Fatigue and Low Vitality,thanks for FAST delivery of Tired of Being Tired: Overcoming Chronic Fatigue and Low Vitality
5,Daphne Shines,Daphne has a soft and twistable tail. She is poseable allowing my 6 year old to use her imangination and play with her in many settings. Yet she is soft enough for bedtime. She has a beautiful and glamourous outfit and her great big eyes as so catching. So we gave Daphne a double thumbs up and 5 stars!
3,okay,this is such a styling cat but shes not so cute. her clothes are very cool and pretty but if your not saticfied with the way she looks you should try bratz dogz or foxz. anyway great toy and great gift.
3,"""It Was O.K.""","I thought I could give this novel ""5 stars"" but I can't. This novel was a tad bit too long, and how many times do we have to read about how Rafe was abused as a child. I hope that doesn't sound too insensitive, but come on now, let's move on. I got more into ""Damien and Angelique"", ""Maurice,Claudette and Jacques"", and their storylines. Sometimes the supporting characters are more interesting than the main characters. Ms. Ray is still an exceptional writer, none the less."
2,Too Long,I enjoyed reading about the secondary characters more than I did the main characters. I also noticed that the ending in all three books are really really rushed. The relationship Rafe had with his sister should have been explored a lot more the author should have gone into more detail and eliminated a lot of the small talk. Christine wore me OUT with her insecurities she finally got it together.
5,Fantastic Pocket Knife,I have many Swiss knives and this MiniChamp II did not disappoint - Very high quality and versatility.
4,Lots of bang for the buck,I require one of these on my keychain at all times. The only thing it is missing is a light. The pen comes in most handily.
3,Too large for a pocket.,"I was trying to replace a Swiss Army knife I carried for years, but this one turned out to be much bigger than my old one, so I returned it."
2,poor quality,I purchased this for my mother in-law for Christmas and one of the sides fell off in less than a month
1,No toothpick,"I had the original MiniChamp and loved it, but it's no longer available. I purchased the MiniChamp II version and am very disappointed that it doesn't have a toothpick. It has a pen in place of the toothpick position. That's not useful for me."
5,Lo recomiendo mucho,"Ya no publican mucho estos libros, pero lo recomiendo grandemente porque este autor es muy versado y erudito en estos temas"
4,Cheese Rounds Cheddar,"These are good, nice cheese flavor. If your out of croutons break up afew for your salad, or float them in onion soup. Pretty Good!"
1,You'll lose weight,"I like white cheddar. I can eat half a pound of it at one sitting. I like soy. I can chug plain varieties of it by the quart.But 'Just the Cheese Rounds, Cheddar Plus Soy' as a snack? It's hard to get down one of these calcified nuggets, let alone a portion.As an added bonus, an aftertaste will naturally curb your appetite for hours."
2,Maybe not intended for adults?,"I am a huge fan of Cedric and Steve Harvey, so this movie was a disappointment because in my opinion, their talents are dampened. I laughed exactly three times, and even those were half-hearted laughs. I'm thinking perhaps this was not intended for adults...I suppose kids would find the situations funny, but both Cedric and Steve seemed like they were wearing muzzles on their brains.If you liked the Lampoon vacations with Chevy Chase, you'll probably mildly enjoy this. But if you're looking for something more similar to humor and creativity of The Steve Harvey Show or Cedric the Entertainer Presents, look elsewhere."
1,ABSOLUTELY DOWNRIGHT DUMB MOVIE,"Corny to the bone! This movie doesn't even deserve a star, it deserves a rasberry. My sister and I watched it together. She fell asleep halfway through, and after my eyes got extremely heavy and dry, I just turned it off. We are actually the types to laugh at movies that are so dumb, they are funny- stupid humor. But this movie was just dumb to the point where we just got upset. You can find about a half a laugh every 10 to 15 minutes, but that's it. Don't even waste your money on a bootleg, or waste your ATTENTION on a free watching of it."
1,Rip Off of a Classic,"It is the same as the Griswald Family Vacation, National Lampoon's something. It is just black now. The Johnsons? I am surprised they didn't call it the ForShizwalds!"
3,i expected better,"the movie was okay, BUT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUNNIER!this movie was bout a family (Johnson) who go to thier family reunion in Missouri (?), and they go throgh some crazy stuff. like they pick up a hitch hicker (Shannon Elizabeth) whos a serial killer. When they get tho the reunion, it gets a little stupid. Besides the reunion i give it a 4 but the reunion part was wierd. LIKE, THEY HAD A SINGING CONTSEST FOR THE FAMILY OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!besides, the reunion it was good."
1,Dumb Movie,Johnson Family Vacation was a extreamly stupid movie. Lil Bow-Wow was horrible and it was very boring. When i first saw it I thought it was a old movie because it was short and the quailty was bad. half the movie was scenes of them in a car that they rented. It was not funny either. Dont watch this.
2,Sub-par road trip movie,"At their best, road trip movies can be transformative adventures (e.g., ""Y Tu Mama Tambien""; ""Midnight Run""). At their worst, they can just be unfocused, meandering wastes of time. Unfortunately, this movie tended toward the latter. Instead of transformation we get one-liners and sight gags, and not even enough of those. Also this movie wasted of fine acting talent, especially, of all people, Shari Headley, whom I fell in love with in the classic ""Coming to America,"" but is relegated to a bit part here. Come back Shari!"
1,Johnson Family Nightmare,"To be blunt and quite honest, this movie (does it even deserve the title of movie?) wasn't very impressive. I'll keep it short and sweet. Johnson Family Vacation was not funny. Johnson Family Vacation did not entertain. In fact, all that Johnson Family Vacation did, was waste an hour and a half of my life. Horrible acting, check. Horrible cast (Lil Bow Wow?), check. A single star review, check."
2,"Stick With Chevy Chase's Film, Instead of This!","The Johnson Family Vacation is probably the un-funniest movie I have ever seen in my life! I already know that it is the un-funniest film of 2004! I don't understand how such a talented cast like Cedric the Entertainer, Steve Harvey, Vanessa Williams, and Shannon Elizabeth could sign up for such garbage like this! This Film was practically a rip-off of National Lampoon's Vacation Movies! One of the worst comedies ever! The only thing enjoyable in this film, is the cast! The cast can make this film watchable but barely!"
2,Pull It From The Comedy Fire - It's Overdone,"This is just like a real-life family vacation: Predictably overdone and maddeningly slow paced with occasional brief moments of hilarity. But those moments are very, very few and very, very far between. Just like this flick.And after reading some of the reviews, I understand the two actors who played the kids are/were briefly famous rap/singers, explaining how they got past the casting director. They're so incredibly miscast; much too self-satisfied and cleverly insincere for what their roles required.Nothing of merit - nothing of note.It's not even worthy of a rainy day rental."
4,That's Why He's the Enterainer,I absolutely love this movie. Cedric the Enterainer is a gold mine in this movie. There's laughs galore in this movie. Shannon Elizabeth cameo is a must look at. Don't miss this movie.
2,dvd,"although the dvd arrived before the delivery date, the product could have been in better conditon. it works and my son is satisfied, but it would be questionable on ordering anything else."
2,Not Good,"The movie is silly. It was in good condition, but not worth the price. Cedric the Entertainer is a little too stupid."
4,dvd,Shipping was really very quick. But DVD is doesn't have eny booklet or print on it. But it's OK.
5,Geekgirl's delight,"As owner of an all-female IT support company, I purchased this tool for all my techs for Christmas last year. We're all absolutely enchanted with it. Leatherman's tools are ok, but if you work on Compaqs you have to have the Torx bits. We've already got cell phones, pagers and pdas hanging off our belts, and there's just no room on a gal's belt to add a Leatherman and the toolbit accessory. The cybertool fits in a pocket or purse and gets the job done while maintaining our sleek appearance. One caveat, however - if you leave this thing at a client site it will NOT be there when you return for it!! So now I'm up here looking at the Cybertool 34 - we'll see how it stacks up against the original.UPDATE: Almost 10 years later, this is still my all-time favorite tool."
5,"Cybertool Pocket Knife - Great tool, knife, both.","I lost a previous one, I missed it so much, I bought this as a replacement. It is great for quick fixes that require a screwdriver. Knifes are sharp and strong. Too bad it is not allowed with carry-on on an airplane"
4,My techie son liked it,"I bought this knife as a Christmas gift for my Robotics major son who wanted a multi-tool. I think that his initial reaction was ""Oh, another Swiss Army knife"", but he was pretty impressed with interchangeable drivers and precision screwdriver. Overall, I think that he was pretty happy with it, so I am too. I was unaware at the time of purchase that there was a larger cybertool with a pliers, which I might have purchased instead, but no real regrets with this product."
1,Distorted Perspective,"Opportunistically takes advantage of the current stereotypes of the Muslim world. Incorrect and skewed portrayal of Islam. Takes one tiny aspect and zooms in. How is a picture of people praying to God an image of ""militant"" anything? Abbas is a professional photographer, so he makes a living from his pictures. But this is simply taking advantage of the current mood to make a mint for himself. It does educate, vivify, inspire or teach. He is hiding behind the cover of the great Magnum Photos umbrella. If you really want to see what photojournalism of different cultures is like, see Cartier-Bresson's book about India. Poor HCB must be turning in his grave."
3,Old school Soca,"A collection of old school Soca, courtesy of Byron Lee and his Dragonaires. Nothing special here, however there are a couple of nice Caribbean tunes."
3,Great price!,But it was very hard to put together! We had to hire somebody to put it together for us.
1,Kryon has violated copyrights !,"It is a well known fact among non-corporeal entities that all materials channeled from Kryon are taken verbatim by Kryon from the books of his teacher, Panka Rubeus Jr.Legal action in the ethereal courts is already in the works, and Panka Rubeus is now taking legal action in Planet Earth courts under advisements."
4,Very Funny Book,"This is money well spent. Anyone who plays golf will get a lot of mileage out of the witty phrases in this book You're guaranteed to get some laughs - just don't use more than 3 or 4 per round, or you'll drive the others berzerk..."
4,Great Collection!,"I teach world literature to high school students and found these stories to be great. contains all the classic pieces you'll usually find in anthologies, but lots of works I'd never read as well."
4,Exactly what it promises,This is alow cost quick install or replacement system. It came with all the parts needed. There were no directions so some knowledge of side pull brakes is needed.
2,Don't over-tighten the mounting bolt,"I barely tightened the mounting nut and snapped the threaded bolt off of the brakes. Pretty cheap metal, but you get what you pay for."
2,Intriguing but not well executed,"The Sweet Trade by Elizabeth Garrett is a historical fiction based on actual people and events. It's about pirates, two of whom are women dressed as men. As catchy as that might sound to someone like me, the actual novel was less than good. There was nothing special about it at all. It was obviously written by a romance novelist trying to break into the mainstream."
4,Sweet irony,"How's this for a twist? This heavily gender-coded bodice-ripper about women who lived their lives as men was written by a male author writing under a female pseudonym.James L. Nelson (aka Elizabeth Garrett) repackaged and rereleased this book in 2004 as ""The Only Life That Mattered: The Short and Merry Lives of Anne Bonny, Mary Read, and Calico Jack"", under his real name.This makes Paul McGrath's hilariously sexist review, well, all the more hilarious really: ""The fundamental problem here is that this is a pirate story written by a woman and about female pirates. It is, to its core, written from a feminine perspective.""Whenever will people learn not to judge a book by its cover?"
2,Interesting volume but...,"This review is written by a librarian and considers the book from that aspect: I have no comment on the veracity of the book, or the subject matter. The most notable thing about this particular work is that the publication date (hard to find BTW) was 2 days after I ordered it; it is apparently a print to order title. The next interesting aspect of the work is that there is no translator credited, and no city of publication. (In short most of the information needed to create a citation is missing: A problem for a work that is likely to be considered by a student writing a high school or college level paper. Apparently it is a reprinting (on demand) of a public domain work, but this is my assumption based on the absence of confirming information."
1,deleted it.,Totally not what I thought it would be. Very boring and dry. Deleted it right after downloading. Might be ok for a student who is new and interested.
4,Interesting,Interesting interpretations. I enjoyed this classic and it did help me gain a small bit of insight into my own dreams.
4,A Beginner's Freud,"This book, according to the introduction by Dr. André Tridon, is an abstract from Professor Freud's ""magnum opus"" on the subject of Dream Psychology. It is a book suitable for a beginner to the topic - and in that it succeeds very well. The book is plainly comprehensible - though some of the terminology used will require a look-up to stay abreast with the abstract concepts that Dr. Freud presents.The Introduction by Dr. Tridon is itself a valuable overview to the methods and conclusions drawn from Dr. Freud's work and should not be skipped! Later portions of the book require close attention and occasional re-reads. The material is abstract and conceptual, but your increased attention is rewarded. Regardless of whether or not the conclusions convince you as a reader, Dr. Freud's enormous contribution to the body of understanding as well as his specific findings are worth knowing, many of which may seem eerily intuitive."
1,like torture,Starts off slightly interesting and you keep going thinking it will become better and more captivating but it only worsens as he anally dissects and basically covers the same thing over and over Ugh! It's like trying to read a wordy law manual as a book-definitely not for beginners
2,Kindle Problems,"It is a great disappointment to be totally engrossed in a book, and then find yourself in an unknown part without any page numbers to indicate where you are. I really don't know how to rate this work, because I had so much trouble trying to read it on my Kindle Touch.From what I was able to read,(In between losing my place in runaway Kindle responses.) I was impressed with Freud's pioneering work on the subject. I found the work to be surprisingly informative and not really that far out of date with modern interpretations of both psychology and dream theory.So my low two star rating is not really a reflection on the book, but is a result of problems with my Kindle.Actually, I was impressed enough with the book,that I might purchase a hard copy, but this is probably the last serious work I will attempt to read on the Kindle.The Kindle Touch is a great idea, but is definitely not user friendly. (At least mine is not.)"
2,What is this thing? What does it do?,"I can't imagine you actually want to buy one of these right? You do know that it's for a really ""not so great"" tape backup system, right?OK, Just checking! I mean, I think that in theory it should ""clean the tape head so that you can read and write magnetic tape without error"". Does it protect your tape heads from all of the harmful ionized filth and dust that impugns magnetic data storage across our fair nation? I have my doubts.On record: doubter."
1,A right reader speaks out,"I found this book at the local store and thought that it would be the kind of young, hip book that my two daughters (both at college) would love. I ordered it from amazon (who I love) and BOY! OH! BOY was I surprised at my kids' reaction.They hated it. Their friends hated it.My daughter thought that it was interesting, but that since Savage dominates the discussion with his own platitudes and endless rants, that ultimately she was left with nowhere to go when she disagreed with him.My other daughter laughed occassionally (he is quite funny sometimes) but thought that Dan Savege was just so full of himself.I'm going back to Isadore."
1,Worst List of 1998?,"Starting a worst book of 1998 list? This one absolutely has to be on it. Dan Savage's book (which is really a collection of his columns and some new commentary) is just plain boring.Those that find this kind of writing witty are just trying to find SOME new voice for the left. OK, so it's about sex. Big deal. OK, so Savage is gay. Big deal.Take away the sexy language and the ""I'm writing a book, Ma!"" attitude and you have some commonplace bad advice.Good advice: Skipit."
1,What Experience???,"I was shocked that this book of ""witicisms"" was published under the headline of ""advice.""Dan Savage's tone is harsh and biting; his responses seem to care little about the community but alot about how he looks in the community.Time after time, Savage attempts to pass off his cute funny bits as true advice.And that makes for shameful reading."
1,Too smug,The guy is horrible and he makes you feel stupid for asking advice. Why do an advice column when you clearly have no compassion or understanding? I think he's offensive and this book is a waste.
4,I didn't learn THIS in high school sex ed!,"This guy is really freaking hilarious. You will laugh out loud, no kidding. The language is extreeeemly crude, but in its defense, there really aren't many mixed-company-appropriate synonyms for t*t-f@#%ing.Meanwhile, Savage doles out darn good sex advice. He'd probably do just as well as any other kind of therapist because he's adept at reading between the lines. And boy does he let people have it if they come across as selfish or whiney. The guy is super funny, and his breezy way of talking about things most people only whisper about is liberating.If you need a laugh, and you're okay with graphic descriptions of sexual behavior, this book is for you."
3,It's kinda OK...,"According to the author, who is gay, he writes for straights in his column of which this book is a compilation. Personally, I didn't find it all that enlightening. Maybe he just picks the letters to which he can give a humorous response and the purpose of his columns isn't actually to instruct. The answers to his readers' questions were often flippant and dismissive. However, I did enjoy Dan Savage's other book ""The Kid"". If you're looking for humor of a sort, you might enjoy this book. If you're looking for answers about sex - keep looking."
3,Read in moderation,"Read this book based on a friend's recommendation. While it is at times witty and funny, the collection of essays gets boring after awhile. I kept picking it up and putting it down. Inevest some casual reading time with it, but always have another book on deck. You can go back and forth with this one."
3,Funny and Informative,"I couldn't read this book on my lunch hour, but I was very entertained by it at all other times.This book was so fun to read, I read it out loud to my friends (who made grunting noises to please me). I reccommend it. :)"
4,Entertaining!,"This book is pretty entertaining and has some good advice. It is probably an acquired taste, but not nearly as cheesy (and unintentionally funny) as those 'Rules' books."
2,Not Likely to be remembered,"As a former reader of Savage Love, I was at first amused bythe idea that Dan Savage was writing a book. Having purchased andread it, I can no longer agree that he is amusing or even interesting. . . He does not dispense witty advice -- rather, he blathers on and on about Dan Savage. God, he isn't even that interesting any more. Kind of like the crazy cousin who comes to the house and won't shut up.This is bathroom reading in a frat house. And not worth the price of admission (even if you like frat boys)"
2,Boring,"I didn't find this book interesting at all. I found it boring, hard to follow and with really bad advice that made no sense. It wasn't even funny. I tried to get into it, but it just droned on and on about nothingness. Wasn't for me."
1,Sizes ?,"well... so ""7.5 M"" US means Mens ? but the category says 'Womens' ... so what size I should order ? hmmm.... Seller doesn't give an explanation."
3,"Defenders of the Earth The Complete Series, Vol. 2","I selected this title out of a feeling of nostalgia. Saying that, it was a fun but breif enough walk down memory lane for me. If you had watchecd it when you where younger, or have young children around then I would recommend these shows. They have a moral stance and enjoyable stories that don't become to preachy on the whole. The animation isn't bad for its time, and the cast has plenty of flaws that can be played on."
3,"Good toy, but gets mould / mildew inside","I have 2 sets of these, one with the duck and the other with various fish. My daughter enjoyed playing with these for a while. She learnt the names of various fish - dolphin, shark, turtle, alligator, pelican, starfish, octopus, etc.The only problem is that they get mould / mildew inside which I tried to clean with dish soap and bleach but to no avail."
5,EZ powder measure,"The micrometer adjust powder measure is easy to install, capable of very fine adjustments to desired powder volume/weight. Great upgrade to my Lee Loadmaster setup."
2,Upper Ball Joint on Trailblazer,"I purchased two of these ball joints for my Trailblazer. Everything went fine with the first one, however the second one broke while pressing in the ball joint. It was halfway in and perfectly straight. Because of the time of day I had to pick up another brand from the local parts store to finish the job. If these are supposed to be the best, they should not break and a part store brand go in just fine."
4,""" Progressive Blues Guitar Licks"" review by Michael Elliano","This is a good book to purchase with Progressive Blues lead guitar. I found it helpful and fun to play. The two books really should be merged into one big book but the price is so reasonable that I say don't even think about it. Buy them both, play them and hear yourself improve. Progressive books are always good guitar books. This is one of the better ones."
4,Lots of good material,"I have several of the books from this series, and this may be the best of the lot. There are plenty of licks in this book that made my ears perk up, and I thought, ""Yes...I definitely need to learn that one. That's cool.""One might make criticisms of this book like, it presents all of these licks out of context, and it would be nice to have someone walk you through some ways to string them together effectively. But you won't hear such criticism from me. Considering the low price I paid for the book, I'd say the value is very high. If I can pick up just five or six licks that find their way into my playing, it's worth it.And I got more than five or six licks from this book."
4,Ukelele Ike is very versatile,"This is a fantastic CD - even my husband was suprised athow many standards were first made hits by Ukelele Ike.""Singin' in the Rain"", ""When You Wish Upon a Star"", ""MyWeakness"" etc. My very favourite is ""Just Like a MelodyFrom Out of the Sky"" - it literally gives me goosebumps.His voice just soars - there is so much emotion in his singing."
2,not practical,"i bought this knife for my husband for a christmas gift. at first he was thrilled to get a new one. upon putting the knife on his key ring and trying to use it, he noticed that the blade opens toward the key chain, making it almost impossible (and very uncomfortable) to use. He had to buy another knife that opened the opposite way. He did, however, like the other features, namely the light and the pen."
3,pretty slick- weak light,"I'm a little on the fence on this item. I love Swiss Army knives, and the key-chain variety with the scissors has beenabout as useful down through the years to me as anything I've owned. This has all the standard blades for their small knife,plus a pen and flashlight. The flashlight beam is so weak that it is useless from more than a few inches away, and the light is red so it is unpleasant to read by. I had to order a pen refill since the one that came with the knife never worked. It's very nice to have one for emergencies, but I wouldn't want to write my memoirs with it. If the light were a little better I'd give it 4 stars, easily. Since that is one of the main reasons to buy this knife as opposed to their basic one, I have to give them 3.5 stars instead."
5,A wonderful pocket knife with pen to write with inside,My husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state--they wanted to share email address---no one had a pen/pencil so my husband's friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with. Everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside.My husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it---could not find it so I did some searching on the net and bought it for his Christmas gift---he was so excited to receive it on Christmas morning. Thanks
4,Delicious but hard to bake evenly,These are so yummy! And sooo easy to make. The only downfall is that we find it difficult to bake them evenly. We have begun making them in cupcake pans and this seems to work great. If you have a mini muffin pan it might even work better. When you use a cake pan the outside is baked nicely but the center is gooey. If you try baking the center the edges get burnt... at least in our experience.
5,SO tasty and chewy,These brownies are beyond great. I make them in ramkins and they stay delicious for days. You can scoop with a spoon and it feels like a special dessert - not like a substitute for a real brownie because it tastes it is better than boxed brownies.
5,"Pricey, but the work fine","The brackets install easily and allow the mixer to rack mount. Rather steep price for such a simple item, but they did the job."
4,Entertaining and informative!,Entertaining story with a very easy reading style. Having lived in the Cocoa Beach area I was delighted to find out more about it's history and the part the Banana River Naval Station played in World War II. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the Navy's World War II Aviation training program.
5,THE AWAKENED SPIRIT,"When I read this book, I was moved into a place of journeying through my past life to find moments or seasons where I looked for people to acknowledge who I was as a person. The book awakened my spirit to abort all those negative memories where I looked for man's approval; replacing them with the stedfast trust in the Lord. I consider a book excellent when it is able to bring eternal healing to a wounded spirit because no money in the world can do that."
3,This smells like my grandma,"Sorry for the 3 stars, but I couldn't get over the smell to actually use the product. It smells like cheap baby powder mixed with a cloying, nondescript field flower fragrance. Why is this so popular with men?"
3,It was O.K.,This book in my opinion was O.K. because all it really tells you is how the producers made the video and how they came up with the title and lyrics.And once again YOU may like this book.
2,Sub-standard,"I'd expected better quality from Icom.The problems:1. Neither the mic nor the speaker holds up long when exposed to salt spray (just spray... no immersion). You can expect 1-2 heavy season's use - unless you mount it in a really protect location.2. The cable pulls out of the plug easily - it lacks substantial mechanical stress relief; overall, the plug it too diminutive and easily broken if mounted in a location subject to brushing body contact - be careful where you mount it in a sailboat cockpit"
1,Product Did not Work,BUYER BEWARE Purchased this CommandMic and when I connected it to my base radio on my boat it did not work. I called ICOM and they advised that it is most likely the base radio as they never have problems with the CommandMics. I took both in to ICOM to see what the problem was. Three weeks later ICOM advided that it was the CommandMic and not my base radio and they charged me $61 dollars to repair. I was sold a defective product that did not work at all. It is too late for me to put in a claim with amazon because the process took so long to. BUYER BEWARE
4,Extending your VHF experience from cabin to helmsman,Great product to reach your VHF from the wheel. It makes your VHF communication easier while you are sailing alone.
1,Gaycee clown copy of worlds worst killer.,"Why would you copy a copy of Wayne Gaycee ""The worst killer in the world."" Whoever got this drawing is not your friend. He may be a killer as well. This happened before any of you were born. This picture will cause people NOT to buy your albums or tickets to your concerts.Dr. John Meksa"
1,"Inventing the ""Great Awakening"" by Frank Lambert",The only inventing uncovered by this book is the inventing that Frank Lambert did in weaving together what he claims are historical facts to showcase his obvious disdain for things Christian and any Christian influence on the history of the United States. He cannot possibly objectively write about something that he does not in anyway understand and that he clearly abhores. Frank Lambert fancies himself an historian but he is nothing more than a propagandist plying his craft on unsuspecting but predesposed readers.
2,"Great CD, Bad Quality","I really like this CD. If you're looking for something fun & bounchy, this is it. The sound quality is something else. This CD was mastered off of vinyl LP's complete with all the pops & crackles. I'd love to see a modern release of this CD from a decent source."
2,not good,I had problems starting immediately when I received the unit. Customer support is weak. One guy kept telling me to return it. Overall I would return it if I could.
3,Good Design Horrible Support,I still do not have the D-Link working. Support is permanently busy and don't respond to emails (or at least are very slow). Followed the directions out of the box and it fails to connect to the internet. Very frustrating first experience. Documentation is poorly written and does not have good troubleshooting help. Just wait til you sit on hold for 30 min - 1hour :(
2,Crashed during configuration,"I read the manual and was initially impressed with how much was included (the descriptions of how the internet works, the roles of routers and firewalls, etc.). I started the configuration process which seemed very easy through the web browser. When I attempted to save and restart the router (a necessary step), I lost all communication with the router. I tried everything (and at this point I found out how lacking the documenation really is-- How do you use the console port? How do you upgrade firmware if the ethernet connection doesn't work?). After talking with DLink tech support on my dime, I was told I would need to return the router for a new one."
2,Only allows specific service port forwarding,"good router with easy setup guide but I wanted to run more services then the built in ftp/http/smtp etc services. I got the firmware update and it still didn't include it. If you want to have webhosting off of port 80 and have a box that can host off of a non standard port your out of luck. I also wanted to run vnc off of a box but couldn't do this. A good, cheap router if all you want is an internet connection but don't need any port services. I'm going to return this one for the netgear RT-311, or maybe the RT-314. The 314 is the same except has built in hub. I guess I should have checked some other source to see firmware specs... or maybe it is a physical limitation that doesn't allow the port sharing but I doubt it."
5,Very easy to setup and use,I just recently had my computer hooked up to DSL and I needed two more computers hooked up to the same connection. So I checked around for an inexpensive broadband router and found that the D-Link #804 fit my budget very well. I could not believe how easy it was to set it up and get it running. I have used other D-Link products and have been very happy with them. I would highly recommend this product to others.
2,Poor performance on @Home cable modem,"This router has the same problem as the SMC 7004ABR. When used in conjunction with older Motorola cable modems and @Home, it has serious lag for each tcp connection. For example, a web page with 30 images (no matter what size) will take almost a minute to load. The solution: get an SMC 7004BR (not ABR) or 7008BR. In other modem/isp situations it is probably just fine.Also, someone else posted about only being able to map certain well-known ports through the firewall (FTP, HTTP, etc.), with no capability to do it by port number. The solution is to use the optional Telnet interface, which allows mapping by port number."
4,great little box,"I had this thing set up and running in under 15 minutes. I was using dialup on one machine at a time before and now I've got my Win95/98/2000 machines up and running on my SBC DSL using PPOE (people with static ip, DDNS, DHCP, and cable modems will find the point and click configuration options easy to use also). The manual and quick install guide was better than I expected. Overall, a very nicely designed package with a lot of great features at a very competitive price."
1,D-link 804: a waste of time and money,"To the best of my ability to discern, the DI-804 is an inferior product. I strongly recommend against buying it. I tried to get the router to work with a DSL connection for 2-months before finally giving up. The router works for a couple of days and then quits. Turning the unit off and on worked for a while, but it has completely died now.Even if the product did work, I would still recommend against it. The documentation is horrendous, both the printed and web versions. Many basic features of the product are not discussed at all. Finally, the telephone support was useless. After being placed on hold for 30 minutes, I was dropped into voicemail. Not suprisingly, my message was not returned."
4,healing with energy not drugs,This is an excellent lay review of the subject of Bioelectromagnetics written in an easy to understand language.Although this is a complex subject the reader is not requiredto have a background in engineering or biology to understandthe clearly explained scientific research in this new and exciting area of research. This book is somewhat unique in thatit also covers subjects not typically discused in a book of this type. For example Dr. Valone talks about the fascinating subjectthat the body is sensitive to visible light (a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum) and that the body also emits visible light. Most reviewers only cover the lower frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus this book is easy to read and comprehensive and can therefore be highly recommended.
4,The electronic future of Medicne,"Between 1900 and 1930 many medical breakthroughs were discovered. May the men like Tesla, Rife, Lackovsky and Priore who's invaluable work in the field of electo-medicine soon gain the recognition they deserve. These men and many others were the self-less pioneers seeking to cure and enhance health for the benefit of mankind.Enough cannot be written on this subject because the subject matter is based on truth!!! We are simply like everything in creation an electronic frequency.Thank you, Jerry Nowacki, CNC, CHC"
2,Very technical,"This book may be helpful to some, but I found it to be way over my head. It is extremely technical. I would not have bought it if I had known this. I only understood about 25 percent of what he is saying. I have a legal background -- not medical or technical. I gave it to my Lyme doctor. He flipped through it and found it interesting."
1,Overpriced,"Despite reading other reviews, I didn't fully appreciate how small this book is until I saw it in person. The pictures are pretty, but this book is hardly worth $8."
5,Amazing. Nature exceeds fantasy.,"This book contains a most colorful collection of creatures.I had never realized that the family of beetles encompassed such variety in colors, shapes, and forms. As an artist, I would recommend this book to anyone who delights in images celebrating the bizarre and the beautiful in nature."
3,Adorably little but the description should have said so....,"This is a beautiful book, with incredible photos of beetles. My sons (age 4 and 8) were constantly fighting over having a turn looking at it. Which leads me to the drawback of the book...it's TINY! Why doesn't the description say this? It's like a mini book. So, when the boys were fighting over it, I put it in my pocket, and then it got lost...so I am buying another one."
2,Too small to appreciate,I am an entomologist. I bet the beetles themselves are larger than these photos of them. I loved most of the pictures. Some elytra pattern photos were just blown up croppings from real photos. Format was somewhat random. I would not pay more than $5 for a book so small you can't open it to view the pictures without busting the bindings.
2,Not as pictured,The peeler you get is the the peeler in the photo. It is some strange shape. Have not tried to use it yet. Still trying to figure it out.
5,A must read for the mom-to-be that is thinking about breastfeeding,"When I was a new mom, Karen Pryor's book was my ""bible"" on breastfeeding. I had recently moved out to the country from Chicago and didn't know any nursing moms. I knew I could trust her wisdom and did...even when my doctor disagreed due to his ignorance. She explains the important physiological and emotional aspects of breastfeeding thereby encouraging you when difficulties arise. Lots of tips on how to avoid problems and what to do if you have one. Many women think, ""It will come naturally,"" but nothing could be further from the truth. Read it out of love for your baby."
5,Nursing Your Baby,My doctor recommended this book for me years ago. It is excellent with practical and medical wisdom. I give it to new mothers as a gift.
5,excellent product -- book,excellent product. book arrived in excellent shape in a short time. I gave it as a gift. I am very satisfied.
2,Disappointed Reader w/ Biased Views,"I purchased this book to help me in my decision whether to breastfeed, how long to breastfeed and to attain some basic knowledge of the process. I felt about 1/2 of the book was dedicated to convincing the reader why biologically woman was put on this earth to breastfeed and if you don't-- how much you may damage your child, 1/4th of the book discussed societal issues involving breastfeeding and the rest of the book really got into the details of how to breastfeed and how to succeed if you run into any problems. Other reviews stated the book wasn't preachy, but I disagree. The authors try to support their opinions with scientific data, but where no data existed to support their point, fell back on examples such as women in 3rd world countries who lack food breastfeed with good results and they also pulled some examples from the animal kindom. I found it quite offensive and disappointing."
4,Lots of good information,"This book was very helpful not only in offering information while I was nursing, but also about weaning."
3,Over-rated breast feeding book,"I was not as pleased with this breastfeeding book compared to the others I ordered. Maybe it was just not written in a style that was comfortable or informative for me. If you are only going to buy one or two breastfeeding books, I would pass on this one for one that is more informative and/or written by certified lactation experts."
4,Informative Book About Breast Feeding,"This is a very informative book about breast feeding. While it covers the basics of how to breastfeed, the majority of the book is about why breastfeeding benefits baby and the mother. It also covers social issues related to breastfeeding. At times I felt I was reading a science article more than a ""how-to"" manual, but that isn't so bad if you have time to read up on it. I learned more from this book than I expected."
5,Take the Road to Eden's Ridge,"By all means, Take the Road to Eden's Ridge. The novel, by ML Rose, traces two compelling love stories over the course of generations, finding common lyrical themes in country/western and classical music. As a result its sympathetic characters have broad appeal for performers, songwriters, and fans (like me). It's got plenty of location appeal as well, from Maine to Tennessee: I can see a film in its future. Who can resist a story about second chances to fulfill youthful dreams that's crafted with such virtuoso flair? The Road to Eden's Ridge ends, of course, but its songs resonate.A Customer"
5,It must be nearby,"I got this book because the local ((in Maine) theatre was performing it. I was unable to attend the play, but I knew that Eden's Ridge must be the next town over from where I live ((Norway Maine). It became a real page turner for me and I am sure it was even better than the play. If they ever perform the play again, I will go. It was sold out every night and I realized it was happening too late to get a seat.."
2,???????,"Let me say this first, I'm not tryin to knock Ms. Gayle's effort. But I must say I found it very hard to read this book because it jumped all over the place! It was told from too many character's point of view, then in the middle of a chapter it went from 1st person to second or third! Crazy! Nice try, but I found it very annoying."
5,Get the Sequel Queen of Spades,If you think King of Spades is good you need to get the sequel Queen of Spades. I read it and I must say you will not be disappointed. In Queen of Spades Baby Girl and the girl are back at it again vowing to get payback and takeover the record label but someone will not sit back or rather lie down and let them do it. You will have to pick up your copy to see what I am talking about. I guarenteed you will not be disappointed. See if Baby Girl get rich or die trying.
4,What goes up must come down.,"This book was pure enjoyment. I didn't want it to end, but I couldn't stop reading it. The tension in the suspense part and the romance part is wonderful. I didn't want to give anything away. Just read and enjoy!King Of Spades"
3,I Have To Agree With PrinceLuva79,This novel started off as the bomb but there were too many characters and to many points of views. Babygirl was the bomb character in this novel as well as Chin but they were never really developed. I hope this author does not get discouraged I just like to keep it real and honest. But I would not recommend buying this book take it out of the library.
5,Sergio is GOD!!!,"Now listen, if the 30 sec previews for this record do not make you want to buy this record then listen to the words that I have to say about my favorite artist in the world Sergio. First of all Sergio's ""Electric Rain"" masterpiece has more emotion than 10 Bob Dylan records combined. Sergio's Save Me is the new age Like a Rollin Stone. His words are both poetic and powerful. Like TuPac he speaks truth to whoever listens without selling out to mainstreem music. In the days of pop stars with fake personas it is time to really take a look at what real music is. This my friends is REAL, and this my friends is MUSIC.Buy this record and play it loud, and remember Bears never give up."
3,okay,"This book was okay,i was more interested in Rosie's sister than i was Rosie and Lemar.There was very little romance and trust in this book, which is why i say it was okay."
2,Reunited,"Rosie Wright and Lemar Reed story would have been a great read if the story would have stay with them 80percent of the time and work on their past, present and future, Rosie lack of trust of Lemar, The book was more on house design, the good for nothing friend Eddie, the sister and her life, there was so much missing"
1,Old Stuff,"This is an old hat, the Diamondbacks have new colors which is Sedona Red. Get new caps okay?"
2,Not much more than an outline,"Eddie Cantor was long overdue for a thorough biography - and, for all its flaws, that biography (to date) is Herbert Goldman's book, not this one. I found this to be an extremely dull recitation of dates and events, and at that not as thorough as Goldman's own research. It gives little sense of the sort of performer that Cantor truly was, and none at all of the sort of person he was. Eddie Cantor was beloved by the public but those who knew him personally were of very mixed opinions about him, and a reader would never know that from this book. Goldman's book has a reach that exceeds its grasp, but it makes some effort to understand its subject. Koseluk's book, published before Goldman's, seems to have been written only to fill a gap in the bookshelf about Cantor. I would not discourage any Cantor fans from checking it out, but the best book about this important entertainer has not yet been published."
5,Good News Bible,A replacement of my former Bible which wore out. I chose large print and am glad to have done so; the soft back is fine. Glad I purchased it as a replacement.
5,Well pleased,My purchase was on time and I loved the bible. It was for a person who has trouble seeing and she can see this one. I would order from this site again.
3,Not Imitation Leather,"My Bible arrived today and it is very nice however, it is not imitation leather as was stated. It has a flex back that is paper. For what I got I paid too much. I bought this particular one because it said imitation leather. Other than being disappointed in the price for the quality of the binding, I am happy with the product."
1,bible,I have ordered the bible two different times and both times they have sent me the wrong item. They are not sending the Good News Bible: With Deuterocanonicals/Apocrypha [Good News Translation] [Paperback]. This is the Catholic version and the two different bibles that they have sent are not the ones we need. Its been very inconvenient not having the bible that we need on a daily basis.
2,BDB,The bible is not as advertised. The covers are more like paper covers. It is not imitation leather and the covers are flimsey. Was this intentional or innocent misrepresentation on the part of amazon?
1,edition date misrepresented,"Book DescriptionPublication Date: January 1, 1976 (not true)Glossary Chronology of the Bible Book introductions Outlines Guides to reading the Bible Readings for special days 1,185 pp.I just received this Good News Bible and discovered that this is NOT the edition stated in the Book Description. This is 1992 Second Edition which changed the original text from the first edition to politically correct gender neutral language. Since 1992 this version of Good News is called GNT, Good News Translation. In case of the Bible and other spiritual literature the edition date is very important and should not be misrepresented. It would have been helpful also if the Bible sellers clearly stated in the Book Description if their edition of the Bible included apocrypha or if they at least allowed to look inside."
2,Not a Catholic Bible,"If you are looking for a Catholic Bible, this is not the one for you. This Bible does not include the Deuterocanonicals/Apocrypha."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased two (2) of these as I have had difficulty in finding ""Today's English Version"" editions of the Good News Bible. I did not necessarily need the ""LARGE PRINT"" editions, but was so happy to find a copy of the ""Today's English Version"" edition, that I purchased two. Sadly, Amazon lists this item as a ""Today's English Version"" edition of the Good News Bible. The bad news: it was not a ""Today's English Version"" edition. The good news: Amazon made good on it and accepted the return of these two copies and issued me a full refund without any problems whatsoever."
4,nuclear security - an inside view,"Having been raised in the era of the development, deployment and security of atomic weapons, I was fascinated to read a first-hand account by someone who had been with the program from its inception, through to a world-wide distribution, requiring total security.Colonel Clark writes not only from a first hand experience of the technical aspects of the systems involved, but also includes his and others' personal stories. These narrations give a glimpse into the dedication, competence and commitment of the few to whom we owe so much in preserving our freedom during a very dangerous era."
3,I just don't get it.,"Okay, so I am not a four year old girl, but I don't get this stuffed animal. My daughter thinks its cool - but more from a status perspective than as a real toy. She doesn't play with it but carries it around with her (to school, gymnastics, etc.). I would say the marketers have done a good job creating ""the myth"" around this toy, but as far as it really being meaningful, forgeddaboutit."
5,One of a Kind,"There never was a singer like Lee Wiley and these singular recordings have survived over the decades as a testament to a smokey, knowing, wry, evocative jazz vocalist beyond compare. The songs have survived over the decades, too--literate, unusual, engaging. A wonderful collection."
5,JUST FABULOUS,I USE TO EAT THESE WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL BUT NOW I AM A GROWN WOMAN AND THEY DONT CARRY THESE IN STORES HERE IN ARIZONA AND I REALLY WANT SOME AND I WANTED MY KIDS TO TRY THEM AS WELL SO I WENT SEARCHING ONLINE AND FOUND THEM. THEY ARE STILL AS GOOD AS I REMEMBER THEM BEING..JUST FABULOUS AND I AM GOING TO NEED TO ORDER MORE BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT I ATE MORE THAN I SHARED...I JUST COULD NOT HELP IT..
5,Organic Canned Dog Food,"Found this product at a local pet store. Ran out of my regular dog food & needed something in a pinch. My dogs loved it! So now, I use mostly this dog food with a little bit of their old food (organic dry crunchy stuff). Their bowls are always empty when they're done!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS FOR 8330 CURVE,"Even though some product descriptions offer this for the blackberry 8330, it is NOT compatible. If you go to the website and update, you find the company went out of business, and the new company no longer intends to update this product, so from 8330 curve models and up (i.e. storm) this product is totally NO GOOD. It is a very expensive paperweight. Also, the new company and return policy was laughable, they were unclear as to how or when my credit card would even be credited for the buy. They could also not confirm either way if I would incur a ""restocking"" fee. I don't recommend buying this as it is an obsolete item, with ZERO customer support."
4,"Not bad, and considering the other options available, usable.","While this keyboard is not the best one I've ever used for my pda (that being the old Targus I used with my HP 3800) it does work pretty well for what I need. The keyboard is a little wobbly on the ends because of the design of their folding mechanism; when it is fully extended the farthest ends are unsupported from below, but if you take that into account it works well.The features I like about it are the full sized keys, their light touch, ease of connectivity, the fact that I can use it with any device with bluetooth, and the auto shut off that saves battery life. It's not a device for a ham-fisted operator, but it's convenient for those times when you don't want to carry a full sized computer around and yet want to take better detail notes than you can on the tiny PDA supplied screen keyboard."
1,Unhappy Purchaser,"This keyboard does not work with my Blackberry. After several frustrating tries, I gave up and tried to contact the supplier. After repeated attempts, they sent an email duplicating info already in the instructions. I have emailed both Amazon and the supplier to return this product, but so far, neither Amazon nor the supplier have responded to my request. Needless to say, I am unhappy with both!"
1,no support,I tried contacting the maker to help me connect to my blackberry. I never received a response. I tried for over an hour on the phone with my phone provider and then blackberry to set it up but had no luck. Since this product is made by a third party and not by blackberry they had no way of knowing what products it actually works with.
4,The real deal,"Todd Wolfe does everything very right on this disc.The playing is emotional, hard, hot and the band interplay is top notch.Obviously Todd is student and long time journey man in blues and he knows what works and has the recipe down cold. The reason it does not get 5 stars is there is a vocal effect used in a couple of songs that I could do without, but it's just my preference.Bottom line is have you heard this type of music before?, If your a blues and rock fan, you sure have. But it's played special."
2,Not For Sensitive Folks,"Somehow, this company has got a reputation for being mild, using few chemicals, and for being ""natural."" I patch-tested this stuff on my arm and it took a week for the resulting rash and itch to go away. If you are at all sensitive to chemicals, STAY AWAY from this product."
2,The Blizzard of '88,I thought the book was average. I was not interested in the region it covered. I thought the book would cover the mid-west where I am from. But it covered New York and I had no interest in that area. The description of the blizzard was good.
5,The truth about psychic phenomena.,"Andre has teamed with another magician to present the facts, from a Biblically true standpoint, about the false beliefs that are constantly attributed to psychics, or to Satanic powers. From a Christian standpoint, Andre deals with the fact that (1)nothing pertaining to psychic ""power"" has ever been shown true, and (2)that many Christians falsely attribute supposed phenomena to Satan and his minions, when in fact Biblically it is not possible for Satan to HAVE these abilities, nor give these abilities to people, so-called psychics. Read this book. It hits the entire realm of psychic power right on the head. I highlighted the important lines and the book literally glows in the dark."
5,excellent,"I really like the ""Coaching by the Experts"" Series and this is my favorite so far. After two years of running an 8 man front, cover 3 defense we switched to the 4-3 because of its simplicity and flexibility. This book details how many different directions your 4-3 can go. From names like Jackie Sherill and George Perles to Dave Wannstedt. Though only one chapter was used to discuss any in-depth coverage philosophies, this is another excellent resource book showing how many different ways the 4-3 can be played."
3,Very nice and organized,"The bag itself is rather heavy on its own, which is why I took away a star. I took another away because it didn't fit into my son's locker at school, even empty! The shelving makes it very big and blocky and, of course, rigid. My kid says it doesn't feel any different on than his regular cheap-o backpack, but I like the fact that's it's supposed to be balanced & healthier for his back. It's great for sleepovers because you can compartmentalize all their stuff, but for us, it didn't work out as a school bag."
3,Quicken 98 for Macintosh,"If you are a just starting to use Quicken 98, this book may get you initally up and running, but will leave you half-way up the financial hill and out out of steam if you are looking for more sophisticated ways of using Quicken. As a new user of Quicken Deluxe 98, I found this book to be helpful with the most basic of the basics, but lacking in many of the finer points of effectively using Quicken. In the Introduction, Negrino admits that he omits sections on Budgeting (which I use a lot), moderate- to heavy-duty Investing, and the Refinance Calculator. Possibly the book was only meant for user of Quicken Basic 98 and not of Quicken Deluxe 98 (I have the latter.)Overall, I found the Help section that came with the software considerably more valuable than Negrino's basic text on Quicken."
3,It was okay.,I purchased the book because of the article on The Twins. I was fortunate to run with them several times and they were such an inspiration to me. Fairly good writing and I did enjoy the stories.
4,feel good factor from Mr.Cetera,"After waiting 6 years for some completly new material from Peter Cetera,if he had 10 cover versions of dean martin numbers id have listened to it!Thankfully the long wait was answered with his best material since One More Story.The first 4 tracks are the strongest point of the album.The wonderful new single,plus the uptempo feel good-RAIN LOVE.FEELS LIKE RAIN is classic Cetera and is sure to be the next single.The lush ballad-IM COMING HOME continues this vain.Top notch job of the old beatles number(though this is peters 8th song using the word love!)Just when u think the albums peaked,it soars with RULE THE WORLD,finishing with WHATEVER GETS YOU THROUGH.Living in Ireland,its been mighty hard getting hold of Cetera's latest work,but ultimatly well worth the wait.With songs like this Peter should be back in the billboard charts and out of the adult contempary one.The feel good factor of 2001!"
1,Disappointing,"As a big Peter Cetera and Chicago fan, I was extremely disappointed when I listened to this CD...so disappointed it has already been shelved. All of the song sound alike, which isn't always bad when it comes to Peter Cetera. However, every single song is very bland. There is no ""feeling"" like in his prior releases. Between lacking lyrics and leaving the instrumental talent behind when he left Chicago, I could not recommend this CD to even another die hard Peter Cetera fan."
3,ANOTHER DIE HARD FAN FRUSTRATED,"I have been a great fan of Peter Cetera. I believe that he is still Chicago. If he had given me this CD and told he wanted to go solo, I would have told him to stay with the band. It seems like he is going downward instead of up. Maybe he is getting tired. This CD was too melow and depressing to me."
3,Good Adult Contemp CD,"Cetera has gotten a bum rap from a lot of the Chicago faithful over the years. Truth is, while Chicago has been for all intents and purposes reduced to an oldies act Cetera has enjoyed some success on the solo front. His albums have all had their high points but are spotty in their quality of material. Another Perfect World is no different, a wonderful title track, but the cd does rely on outside material too much. It makes you wonder if Peter is plagued by writers block (he had the last 5-6 years to come up with material). That said, Rain Love, Feels Like Rain and Just Like Love are quality tracks. We could have done without a Beatles cover, but he does a nice job with it. There also tends to be a certain ""sameness"" to the tracks as the cd goes on, but by and large this is an enjoyable adult contemporary album...and Cetera's unique voice has aged well."
4,"...singable, pleasant, up-lifting...","I must admit that I bought this CD with the intent of copying one or two tracks off of it and then returning it to the music store for a full refund, as is the trend these days with so many people who are tired of paying full price for a CD that only has one or two good songs on it. Well, I decided to keep it because the CD has about 6 or 7 really good songs on it. The only problem I had with it was that Peter doesn't hit the high vocal ranges that he has in the past which make his sound so unique. But the quality of the songwriting and production makes this a good buy. Definitely one of his better solo releases..."
3,Another Perfect Album,"This new Peter Cetera CD is a warm and wonderful delight from start to finish. It may not have chart climbing songs like previous efforts, but that does not mean a single thing. The song ""Just Like Love"" is a classic Cetera song. It's the best song he's done in a while. ""Rule The World"", with it's big power ballad opening, falls into that category as well. The last two songs are a little dark and somber. The songs all sound more polished than previous albums. Plus, a good number of them are also longer than most songs he's done. This is the strongest album he's done since ""World Falling Down"". His warm, amazing voice is in fine form here. He sounds incredible. As for the other reviews on this page, I have to say ""Please!"". The negative reviews are as wrong as can be. The album hasn't been shelved either. I don't know know where they came up with that one. If you are a Cetera fan, you will eat this one up. A mild tempo delight. Ignore the naysayers."
5,It's about time!!!,"I was wondering how long it would be until Peter came out with a new album, he always seems to keep his fans waiting patiently for years. This is unfortunate because of his unique talent as a song-writer and a voice that comes from heaven. This is a must have for all Cetera fans. I say that about all his CD's because there are so few of them. He delivers strongly with ""Perfect World"", the first track on the album, and then it seems mellow out a little. It is a big change from his albums ""Solitude, Solitaire"" and ""World Falling Down"". Fortunately, he seems to have found his ""Perfect World"" and has delivered another wonderful album. Let's just hope he doesn't make us wait so long for the next one."
2,The party seems to be over.,"I have always been a big Cetera fan (still am). Some of my best memories revolve around some of his songs. Another Perfect World is, and I am reluctant to say, somewhat of a disappointment. As one reviewer stated, ""It has already been shelved."" I believe it has something to do with the album lacking personality. A couple of the songs rekindle the fire, but mostly I found myself becoming very anxious. Anyway, I would like for Cetera to come out with another album. I am sure I would buy it. Maybe next time..."
3,Another Almost Perfect Album,"I am a long time Peter Cetera fan - goin' back to his Chicago days.Another Perfect World is less than perfect, but is a really good album. I REALLY like the first four songs and the cover of the Beatles ""It's Only Love"". ""Perfect World"", Rain Love"" and the Beatles remake are stand outs, though ""I'm Coming Home"" is classic Cetera. Gone is the country twang (thankfully) from the ""Collection"" album.There are no duets on this album and no remakes of Cetera witten Chicago songs, though I'd love it if he re-did ""Song For You"" from Chicago XIV. I love what he did w/ ""Happy Man"" on the ""One Clear Voice"" album.The BIG complaint on this one is he only wrote (co-wrote) THREE of the ten songs. I love his songwriting and after five years, I figured he'd have more to say. That aside, if you love Peter Cetera's music and voice - buy his one."
3,Better Than Previous Albums,"Peter Cetera's solo material is fairly bland ballad driven pop. However if you to have one of his albums in your collection this would be the one to have. Yes there are some ballads here but overall this album is not as sappy and cheesy as his earlier solo stuff. The song writing here is stronger than all of his other albums some of the songs are not about the usual love crap. Whatever Gets You Through, Rule The World, Have A Little Faith, Only Heaven Knows those four songs arent sappy love ballads. I should add he does a good job covering The Beatles It's Only Love. Rain Love and Just Like Love are filler and could have been left off. Good job Peter aside from his 1981 debut this is a very good effort."
3,Frustrating,"This is very well designed furniture but not very well put together. In the case of the bench, one of the drawers cannot be opened. We are going to try to fix it then return if necessary. We bought 7 pieces of this furniture line and had problems with 5 of them. Manufacturing execution issues."
4,relentless insight,"Disability was beautifully written, taut, unsentimental, insightful as regards who/what is ""disabled."" The novel is a powerful indictment of how we treat the mentally disabled and is also a profound meditation on the process and purpose of education not only of the disabled but of any and all, especially in light of our ""accountability"" driven educational system."
3,very good but a little wordy,"In many, many cases meditation could replace drugging and - although I do not take any drugs - I expected a more practical, concise, approach. I like Osho, an his unconventional ways, but really less is more! Truths are being drowned in unnecessary words here and it takes some patience to pick them up."
4,"8"" parchment rounds","I liked that these rounds were already pre-cut so I didn't have to fuss with tracing and cutting my own, but I did find that they didn't fit my pans, they were slightly too big. But with some nonstick spray, my cake layers did not stick at all. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and order again."
5,Parchment Circles,These are great for baking. So nice to not have to cut the circles from the roll of parchment! Great idea!
5,Essential parchment paper,"When I considered buying these round parchment papers, I thought to myself ""how silly, just cut the rounds out of a roll of parchment"" Well I am so tickled I bought these. So convenient and really help my cakes look better with no sticking. I had bought these from a ""high end"" store a few months ago, and these Regencys were just as good if not better & also a much better price. I keep them in the plastic they come in under my silverware holder in the drawer, perfect hiding place. Would highly recommend this product and price from Amazon"
2,Can't recommend. Sticks to bread.,"Sorry, but I can't recommend these. The size is convenient, but they stick to my bread loaves after baking and have to be peeled away, coming off in pieces. I'll stick with the regular supermarket parchment paper that has to be cut to size but slides away easily after baking."
3,Regency 9' round parchment paper,"I don't know if any one else has had this problem too but I still had to trim these to fit MY 9"" pans. Once that was done they worked great. Still, if I'm trying to save time by not cutting out circles from a sheet of parchment, why spend the time having to trim them. I do plan on buying a more expensive set of 9"" pans, maybe they will fit better than my ""cheap"" ones. You would think 9"" is 9"" no matter what."
3,A little too large for my springform pan,"I had to trim these circles down nearly a 1/4"" in order to fit my Nordic Ware Leak Proof Springform Pan (10 Cup, Assorted Colors, 9 Inch). Once I did, it worked well."
3,Paper too large for exact fit.,"The parchment paper was a good idea to have on hand, but it did not fit exactly to my 9 inch pan as noted."
4,They say they are for 9 inch pans,"I bought these to use in a 9-inch spring form pan I had just purchased. These did not fit the pan, they were too big for that pan. They do indeed measure 9 inches across. Quality of materail seems decent. I am just disappointed that they didn't work our for me."
1,Won't try parchment again!,"I've been baking for 50 years and have never had a cake stick to the pan. I just tried parchment liners because all the experts recommended them. Well, for these first time in 50 years, my cake stuck! Won't try them again!Grease and flour works for me!"
4,"Regency 8 Inch Round Parchment Paper, Set of 24","So very useful in the kitchen for someone who bakes as frequently as I do. It saves a) me time from cutting out rounds from parchment paper every time I want to bake (which is often) and b) my sanity over the fact that parchment rounds cut out from the roll would always curl up and don't stay flat in the pan. My only complaint is that with my cake pans very slightly tapered at the bottom (which I think most are, to some degree), these parchment rounds are not a perfect fit for them. There is very little extra which rises to the side (about 1 mm), and it doesn't affect the outcome of the cake at all, but my OCD brain finds it annoying."
3,It's hard to find this size so that's why I bought it...,"Love that they have this size out there, wish it was a little thicker. It's so thin that things tend to soak through. You get a lot for the price though. Hoping at some point they have a thicker version."
5,Easy to Use!,These parchments save time and they peel away from the cake in an instant making your cake baking experience a delight!
5,Round parchment paper,I've used them only once so far and the results were great. I did use some non-stick spray with them just to be on the safe side and the cakes slid right out of the pans. It made for a very easy clean up also. Highly recommended.
2,happy baker,Parchment were a big help not having to cut from a big roll; but they were not the exact size as noted; had to cut them just a little to fit in the pan.
1,terrible bag,I bought this bag for my 2217 and It tore at the bottom seam right after I filled it with 2 liters of bio media.it's garbage. you may as well just use panyhose!
4,It was fun making the scarves but it takes too little time,You can create wonderful designs amd my daughter that is nine years old didn't have any trouble doing the painting by herself but she finished both scarves in less than half an hour
1,This Abbott and Costello story is a rerun,"Abbott and Costello fans be warned: this book shamelessly recylces and abridges material from earlier books, including Jim Mulholland's ""Abbott and Costello Book"" (1975) and Furmanek and Palumbo's ""Abbott and Costello in Hollywood"" (1991) in an offhand attempt to cover all of Bud and Lou's work. As a result, it covers nothing well. Other detriments: no index; numerous errors; the corny ""theme of baseball"" approach; a gushy, juvenile writing style suitable for nine-year-olds. Pick up either of the other books, which are vastly superior."
4,A warm salute to the boys!,"Nifty bio of the comedy team, with page after page of terrific photos (some in color!) and interesting facts about their careers. Of particular interest for lengthy sections about Bud after the split and the team's tax problems. Overall, a good job, but less adulation would have made book stronger. A&C were terrific comics and solid human beings, the kind of people that we need more of today in Hollywood. This book does a nice job of conveying their humanity in addition to their humor."
2,My Nuvi would not work with this protector on it!,"Update to my review:My GPS unit WOULD NOT WORK with the screen protector in place. I applied it carefully according to directions. So, I cannot recommend the product.Boxwave's customer support was great--They sent me a prepaid return label and cheerfully gave me a prompt refund.Great idea if it would work!"
1,Does not fit,"The item as delivered simply does not fit properly. It is larger than the Nuvi 350 screen. I had to cut both the width and height slightly to make it fit. Since the advertisement is clearly for a ""Nuvi 350"" protector, I found this ridiculous.I e-mailed the company and they said I received the proper item, it wasn't the wrong one. Instead of modifying it, they said I should have asked for an exchange, even though I received the right thing to begin with. What would be the point?? Waste a couple weeks of my time with shipping back and forth to get the exact same thing?"
5,highly recommend,"these clear screen savers are worth every penny, you may not think that your finger tips will scratch the screen, but when you have to replace the screen down the road because of the fine scratches you will wish you had taken my word for it."
3,The new seminal/live.,"as I said, the new seminal/live, only with indistinguishable musicians. If you liked seminal live, and can live with less fall/more bland guitar tones, buy. If you don't know who the fall are, have never owned any of their LP's, then don't buy this, buy ""THIS NATION's saving grace"" for five quid."
1,not what i expected,My knife seems to have a defect! whenever you open the blade the locking mechanism gets stuck between the blade and the right side of the knife and its a real pain to get unstuck
1,Great Knife bad pocket clip,4/24/2010 Good sharp knife but ..... Had this knife for 2 months and lost it due to the poor quality of the pocket clip. It is not springy enough to take the daily abuse. It took about 2 weeks for it to lose enough spring so that it would fall out of my jeans pocket. Now it is gone and I will not be buying a Gerber to replace it!10/15/2010 Have a Spyderco for the last 6 months and the pocket clip is still as good as new!
1,Liquid Motion Discontinued....,"Microsoft has stopped supporting Liquid Motion. So basically, this book is obsolete."
4,no holds barred,"If you are looking for a video that will make you laugh until you cry, this is the one. Peppered with the trademark Cho humor, it confronts controversial, sensitive, and socially important issues . I love her no holds barred style of comedy, and as an Asian American woman I appreciate her willingness to attack steretypes, dismantle misconceptions, and address issues that lesser people run away from or avoid everyday. Her ability to cover personal and sensitive relationships, situations, and experiences is touching and reminds each of us to be introspective about our belief systems. I would love to have seen more behind the scenes stuff or even some brief pieces that outlined the things she was responding too --for example 'the american girl' episodes with her commentary mixed in...All in all, a movie you can watch over and over"
5,Pretty good for a (way smart) high school dropout!,"My first response to this video was: Eeeww! She was funny, but I wasn't sure I wanted to learn about men's gay porn. But she was waay too funny to turn off. She takes her horrible experience with the Hollywood celebrity mill and makes us laugh. I thought the show was well written and Margaret on stage was great. Her faces were priceless!This is a video to pop in the machine any time you're feeling sorry for yourself and need a good laugh."
4,Brilliant performance!,"For those of us who can't get enough of Margaret Cho when we hear sound bites of her live performances or read small passages from her various writings, here's a gift wrapped up with a giant bow: a live filming of one of her shows. Cho is every bit the superstar as she narrates her entire career, if not life, using the funniest impersonations of her mother (that are sometimes so touching they'll make you cry) and the scariest parts of her very colourful career. She's honest about her previous problems with drugs, her obsessions over her weight, and all the rocky relationships she's survived, making her comedy so important to her audience because of her candid confessions. Apart from that, she's the damned funniest woman in the world next to Jennifer Saunders, and this film shows us everything about what makes her so. Don't hesitate!"
5,She's the One That I Want,"I have to say, her impression of her mother will leave you laughing for days. The joke about Gwen will be something you'll probably remember for a long time to come, just because of how annoyingly funny and disturbing it is. I sure never want anyone I know to end up in a hospital with Gwen, that's for sure!"
3,Decent material before she really finds her voice,"I saw Notorious C.H.O. before I saw this, and I have to say that her most recent work is a lot better than this, which was recorded in 2000. This one is fairly funny, but seems like a less passionate performance than her ""Notorious"" performance, which is brilliant in it's topics, her voices, and her FACES!!! Her faces are priceless. This is decent stuff, but if you want to see Margaret shine, get Notorious C.H.O. intstead, where she is much more confident and much funnier..."
3,The Cho Show,"The comedian's quasi-one-woman-show stand-up act is introspective, retrospective, and hilarious. A must-have for Margaret Cho fans (obviously). Includes a few DVD extras. See also: ""I'm the One That I Want"" - the book."
2,"Talented Speaker, Boring Comedian","Margaret Cho is a very talented speaker. She can communicate a message clearly and effectively, and that is exactly what she did in ""I'm the One That I Want.""It was not funny. She didn't make any jokes. She told stories in a way that I personally found to be very annoying.As noted by other reviewers, all of her material alternates between mostly personal gay stories or fills in with other stories about her personal life. I don't care about her life or personal stories more than I would anyone else. I didn't need to watch an hour and a half of boring life stories from someone I don't even know. I already get enough of that in real life."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"One review stated it correctly, he answers questions no one is asking; including me. I have read several book on hiking the AT as I'm making preparations to do the same and due to the writing style, I've left this book twice to read others but since I bought it, I've now returned to it.I dissagree with one review in that I find the book somewhat difficult to read. It seems the author is more of an intellectual and I find the book is not real easy to read. Of course, it's more of a statistical study and is not meant to be a story about an adventure.It does have some interesting facts and information but you have to week through a lot of wording to get to the information. My main complaint about the book is the way it's printed. Each page is two columns and the print is very small and I find both of these issues makes it more difficult to read."
3,Interesting Information: But Was Written More Than 20 Years Ago,"This Book was interesting in all the questionaire information Roland Mueser gathered from other thru-hikers. But, it is not ""the definitive guide to long-distance backpaking"" as it is stated on the back cover. It is way out of date which one cannot determine from reviewing the inside of book on website. There isn't much about his thru-hiking story really. It mostly talks about the answers to the qestionaire he handed out to other hikers and the results are displayed in tables. The book is entertaining because some of the sujects that are discussed are timesless in their nature."
5,fascinating,"This book gives interesting facts about typical hiker experiences on an adventure along a 2000 mile hike along the east coast of the United States. The author portrays the experience as a strange one, and gives survey results from dozens of fellow hikers."
4,Hiking The AT,A very good book for getting information with a few stories to go along with it.A must if you plan on doing a sectional or thru hike on the AT.
4,Great Book,"I found this book to be both scientific and faithful. The Author (Roland Mueser) had real experience from his life on the trail as well as statistics from the 136 people that also shared in his travels. I found the book to be both entertaining, and informational. Great read! See you on the Trail 2011, Thru-hiker!"
1,Dated Info and hard to read on the Kindle,"I have a passion for reading books about outdoor experiences especially stories of the AT and PCT. The style is very academic the author's voice only rarely appears. The author is essentially sharing the results of a survey he did about AT thru hikers in 1989. Therin lies the main problem, he shares insights about equipment and hiking technology that is completely out of date. It is like reading about the merits of an Apple IIe vs. an IBM 286 computer to gain insights about computer technology. That said, the insights about hikers and the long distance hiking are interesting, relevant and timeless. Finally, there are many charts and list in the book that are hard to read on the original kindle (speaking of old technology). This book is WAY too expensive for a kindle title....."
5,Summary of Hiking Issues,"This book, based on a number of surveys, provides a broad understanding of what hiking the AT is all about. It explores the motivations of thru-hikers along with answering lots of questions most of us have when planning to hike all or sections of the AT. Easy reading, well organized and lots of facts."
5,Suberb and important work- Gets a grip on the reality of the American Family,"Coonz dissects piece by piece the ideal of the ""normal"" family and lifestyle that neoconservatives frequently point to, as a solution to society's ills. Coonz's research is meticulous, and this book is a potent antidote to the fallacy that too often guides policy making in Washington and statehouses across the nation. i.e. that only the reestablishment of the ""normal"" traditional nuclear family is the path to our salvation. A+"
4,Done Well; Informative,"I read this book several years ago, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. The research was woven into the study excellently, and the discussion of how the families of the 50s helped create the families and culture we have now was facinating. If you're interested in American culture, esp. The Family, this is a book for you. The book does get a little slow at times, but if you stick with it, you'll be well rewarded"
3,The Way We Never Were,"I didn't thoroughly read the book, as I was reading for recreation and not educational purposes, but it was a good read in my opinion. I'd like something like to be written in a less academic tone, but the information was enlightening and I think it includes points and studies that should receive more publicity. It's definitely an eye-opener."
1,Boo,"not reader-friendly, boring. hard to follow - only got it because it was required reading for one of my classes"
1,Why does nostalgia bother this author?,"This book is an attempt, albeit a feeble one, to take a gentler time in America and somehow demonize it by begging the question and nit-picking. To say life was better in that time is to state an obvious truth and I wonder why Ms. Coontz feels the need to somehow try and show us that today we are ""so much better off."" Drug abuse, kids killing and having kids, abortions, teen suicide, are the order of our day today. At least in the 1950's most folks had some reference to the whole. Now it seems we don't care who we hurt as long as we get what we want and get it NOW.There is no use trying to elevate today by tearing down yesterday. The plain truth is that the 1950's were in many ways a better time no matter how this author wants to twist statistics and figures and I bet that way down deep beyond the pseudo-intellectual, politically correct veneer, the author knows it was too."
3,good,"satisfied. no alchol scent. very neutral...reasonable price. I don't recognize antioxidant effects, though. wanna buy it again."
5,Perfect,I got this to replace the pin that slides through the bullhead mounts and through the swim platform attachments that slide into the bulkhead mounts. ...for my 1991 Masstercraft. Works perfectly.
3,Not good enough for a biology class,"I bought this for my homeschooled biology student. He told me it just isn't powerful enough to see all he's supposed to see in the slides. It works well enough and what you do see is clear, but it's not powerful enough for what we needed."
2,101 trees of indiana,"Too technical , does not use the commen names , does not show the limb paterns of tress , a booklet from Perdue will give more useful info for the person in the woods."
4,"Nice, basic bowl","This serving bowl is versatile and fits with almost any table setting. The price was low, and the color and quality of the piece are good."
2,"buyer beware: poor sound, missing scene","this cd is missing the letter scene between bartolo and rossina near the end of the second act. it seems to have been omitted since there is a noticeable break in the music where this exchange should be. anyway, without it the final confrontation between almaviva and rossina doesn't make any sense. the sound is also muddled. it sounds like it was recorded by a hand-held recorder. it definitely wasn't a radio broadcast. the voices come through, but it falls far short of a studio recording."
4,Wonderful first novel!,"Nordberg tells a haunting story that keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. Handling an important social issue in a sensitive and well-researched manner, she has created an unforgettable family drama. The author's sense of place is one of the most notable things about this novel. I could feel the Pacific breezes and smell the rain through her prose. I will anxiously wait for her next novel."
4,Hot Dog Stand: The Works,"This game is fun, and at the same time you are learning important math skills. I played it in school and now I love it! You are given an office, and you are in charge of a hot dog stand at a stadium where concerts, football, baseball and soccer games are held. You are assigned an event and then you are to check the weather report so you know how much stuff to order. There is also a book shelf where you can look up the average amount of things sold at your event with you specific weather. This game is AWESOME!!!!"
4,Affordable wireless headset,Everything is easy about this headset. The only complaint I have is that the strap for your ear on mine is slowly falling apart (i use mine on a daily basis). Takes right about 2 hours to charge from dead empty. Also produces an echo every once and awhile. Have also had problems with background noise on 1 or 2 occasions. Overall great headset. Bought a few as gifts.
2,"Openings too small for 6.5"" speakers","I have a few sets of speakers in the closet, and none of the 6.5"" ones would fit the hole in these adapters. The 5.25"" MTX components I had on the shelf would fit, but I bought these adapters for 6.5"" drivers not 5.25"".I can (and did, ultimately) enlarge the hole, but then why didn't I just make adapters from wood if I wanted to cut stuff out? I bought these to save me the trouble/mess, now I have the trouble anyway."
4,Require a little work,"In my case using an Alpine 6.5 speaker required me to bevel and enlarge the larger openings, and the component tweeter opening had to be made using a hole saw. Once that was done everything went together smoothly. They seem to be a little too flexible but are fine once installed.Worth the money for time saved over fabricating from scratch, but you may still have some work to do."
2,Did not fit my car,"Ordered this for my 2011 toyota corolla S, amazon garage recommended it as it would fit my car however it did not. The product itself is fine, just the fit specifications should be looked at further. The Toyota corolla has a unique 6x9 bolt pattern extending out further than a normal 6x9 patter so this product does not line up with the original bolt holes, if you want to drill and cut new holes then it would work fine."
5,A trilogy of terror - and much more!,"This is the 1st in the trilogy of the vampire world which is just truly awesome. You must read this stuff because you would be catching this author at his highest peak in this amazing series. This is what hollywood movies should be made of folks! This has it all - horror,action/adventure,sci-fi/fantasy, a sex that will blow your mind! This guy can write a horror novel like nobody else. You will sorry if you don't enter this world - you may not want to leave!"
5,Great start to an AMAZING trilogy.,"This first book, ""Blood Brothers,"" is an amazing start to my favorite Brian Lumley trilogy, ""The Vampire World."" You are introduced to Harry Keogh's talented son, and from then on the story unfolds...Don't let me tell you what happens, read it for yourself, you'll love it!"
5,The penultimate vampire vision!,"This is the view of vampires that supasses all that have come before. Mr. Lumley's writing style is both vivid and lyric. His Vampyri are glorious, gluttonous, horrific and fascinating. These guy's would be dining on Lastat's or Dracula's puling hearts before they even knew they were prey. Do yourself a favor and read the other authors vampire visions before start Lumley's, he'll ruin you for the others."
3,Wasn't realla paperback or hard back,The book came from a Library in Oklahoma with a semi hard cover. Just seemed rather cheesey and not what I expected.
3,This is a self-help journey,"First off... make no mistake... Barbara's father should have been punished. I empathize with the author for her needless suffering. It's hard to be critical of someone who experiences this type of trauma, but I found the book to be a bit long-winded and repetitive. Over all, I think it was written by Barbara to help herself rather than help others. That's perfectly ok, and I'm glad it seems to have been therapeutic for her. Rather than be nit-picky with the book content, I merely have to ask myself if I was glad that I read it. I really can't say that I was."
2,Shallow characters and plot,"The idea is interesting, but the execution is not very good. The characters lack distinct personalities, even the main alien. What is worse, for a space opera the plot is thin and suffers from too much exposition. There are many instances of characters just explaining what happened rather than having the reader discover about events as they happen.The writing feels lazy and not very well edited either. As an example, at one point the crew starts referring to a race of aliiens by their alien name one chapter before their name is actually revealed.I was looking forward to this book, but now that I finished it I don't plan to read the sequels."
5,My first choice,"In teaching preschoolers and elementary students about the Underground Railroad, a tricky topic even for grown-ups, this book is a godsend! I recommend it to all teachers, parents, any one who is trying to get the idea of Freedom Seekers' journey north across to their children. Amazing illustrations are a big part of why it works so well, but even without them the story is easy for young ones to understand. It uses animals--always a favorite with kids--and is quite suspenseful. It's my favorite children's book on the Underground Railroad to date."
4,A very enjoyable read,"I cannot say whether it is the lawn care version of Fast Food Nation, but it is an excellent insight on American Lawn culture. This book traces the beginnings of the lawn culture to the present day exploring the various industries it has spawned and its effect on nature and society. A very enjoyable read. I recommend it."
5,Perfect for ballet shoes,I had a pair of ballet shoes but didn't have any elastic to sew them. This was more than enough to sew the shoes. Great color and style match.
2,"Not a bad mixer, but....","This mixer works okay, but I was disappointed that it only came with the regular beaters. I previously owned a mixer (approx. the same price) that also came with curved dough hooks. The little splatter shield that comes with it is useless, unless you happen to be using exactly the same size of bowl as the shield. I still spilled stuff all over. And Hamilton Beach's customer service is VERY DISAPPOINTING. I will not be buying from them again!"
5,Bosch ignition wires,"These ignition wires fit my 2002 dodge caravan 3.3 flex fuel. They are slightly longer than stock, went on easy and the van runs good."
5,"Look, Feel, and Seem to Perform as OEM (Could be OEM)","Ordered for a 2005 Dodge Grand Caravan...Had a CEL and slight miss when driving, had ~85K miles on van, so purchased Plugs, Plug Wires and Coil for an early 100K mile tune up....Did not pinpoint the issue but all 3 item-set did fix its issue, and will add I did in darkness see too much crossfire between old plug wires...These issues can be hard to differentiate between wires, coil etc, so at a nominal price I replaced all in one swoop...As Titled, these are same color, thickness, feel, and as far as I can tell perform like OEM as well.Recommend"
5,Good replacement for OEM,Installed on a 2004 Grand Caravan. No problem. They are slightly longer than OEM which makes them easier to route.
4,Good blade for fine trim.,"This blade seems to perform very well. However, it is not thin kerf. At least not by my definition. It is so much thicker and heavier than the frued blades that I usually run, I have to slow down on repetitive cuts or the motor on my dewalt starts cooking. (Got so hot it smelled up the house with burned plastic smell) To much fly-wheel effect. Would work great in different application such as stair building. Especially since there is less deflection with this thicker blade."
5,Smooth as Butter,"I bought this blade to replace a manufacture original blade.At first glance this blade is great. Clean cuts, low noise and low vibration. Only time will tell if this blade is a winner.To check out a more in depth review check out [...]"
3,Overall Average,"If you are looking for a blade on a budget then then this is for you. You really can't get much that is better without spending 25% to 50% more. As a contractor that cuts trim for new homes I can say it's not my blade of choice. The very first day I used it to cut oak it was just OK and left splinters on the back side of my cuts. I used it for some crown moldings the second time and I feel like its getting dull already. In summary if you make lots of cuts and want your work to be looked upon as ""perfect"" or close to it then don't run this blade. If you want a decent blade for under $50 go with it. I'm willing to bet all the people that rated it 4 & 5 stars are not professionals."
5,Salsero 101,"I HEARD THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT,THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY GOOD....IT SOMEHOW GOT LOST......SO I GOT IT AGAIN...IT IS AMAZING HOW MUCH IT IMPROVED SINCE THE THE LAST TIME I HEARD IT...I WAS NOW LISTENING TO SOMETHING FAMILAR..YET I WAS LISTENING TO SOME STUFF I HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE.... I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED THE SECOND TIME AROUND....WOUND UP BUYING CUBA LA TWO...BUT THE MAGIC WAS LOST THE LATIN SALSA JAZZ COMBINATION WAS TOOO JAZZY..BUT CUBA LA ONE IS PURE MAGIC...."
3,I'm glad I read it.,"This book has a lot of interesting information in it, but the author obviously has an axe to grind that gets in the way of what he is trying to say. That doesn't make his information any less interesting or credible, at least some of it. In fact, I found a lot of what he had to say actually made the case he was trying to dismiss. Confusing? If I hadn't already done a lot of reading about Jonestown prior to this book, I would be too. Nevertheless, I'm glad I read it, and would recommend it as an adjunct to any other research on the subject."
4,Gonzales is a Master!!,Solo Piano album is a must for every piano player.Mr. Gonzales is a real master in his style of music.Enjoy the music.
1,"Great Album, Horrible Quality mp3","This is an excellent album, and one of my favorite to put on when relaxing. However the mp3 download from amazon was horrible quality. The sound degenerates into crackling noise on the high notes. I am missing all of the wonder flourishes and accents. I thought it was my speakers but the sound comes out the same on all of my setups. This is a shame as I have had excellent luck with most other amazon downloads."
2,Disappointed,"The Founders were more interesting and complex than Brookhiser - normally an excellent writer - portrays. Lots of words, few conclusions."
3,"Fantastic Premise, Doesn't Fully Deliver","How many of us haven't considered the founding fathers' reactions every time we receive a speeding ticket, pass a police checkpoint, or read about a Department of Homeland Security? By premise alone, this book is a timely and necessary addition to contemporary political works. However, the delivery is a mixed bag. Some of the questions are insightful, well-researched and informative. As other reviewers indicated, others are not and simply regurgitate well known history, as an undergrad would on a history 101 exam. I do enjoy Brookheiser as a writer, and his list of websites based upon the foiunding fathers' personality traits was quite humorous and fit well with what we knew about these men.Perhaps I expected too much, as a work such of this could fill volumes, given sufficient research. This book, although enjoyable to read at times, is a highly abridged version of what this book could have been."
3,Easy Reading,Well written book that attempts to give insight as to what the founders thought of their situation at the time and how it relates to todays questions. Some parts are vague but overall the book is a nice easy reader. I recommend it for the history buff like myself.
5,"Whales, Turtles and Dolphins from Superior Home Video","This is a great video! Whales, Turtles and Dolphins - the most widely loved creatures of the sea! This musical voyage of the underwater world instills a deep appreciation for these graceful 'ambassadors' from the deep. The up-close underwater photography is spectacular and the music is superb! You'll love the relaxing tranquility and visually stimulating excitement of this program! This video lasts 30 minutes. superiorvideo.com"
3,The Afrikaners,"Le May has produced a work about the Boer Afrikaners that is neigther very good nor very bad. It could better be called ""A political history of the Afrikaners"", as there is strong emphasis on politics in the XXth century. And this emphasis is mostly on power politics in the realm of the Nasionale Party. It is informative and relatively objective in this limited sense. Therefor 3 stars."
2,Let's not forget what problem we are trying to solve,"The problem is twofold: to understand and to develop a framework to use E&M.; I do not feel that this book adequately addresses either problem.Instead, this book spends a lot of time developing a Clifford Algebra approach and the attendant notation. Very little physical feel; or, for that matter, very little calculation at all. This looks more like a pure math text than a physics book. There are few drawings or other geometric things that relate to the real world. This subject is hard enough without loading much more notation on it."
5,nice thanks,nice thannks i liked it i put it right away in my car it makes my plate look better and racing
3,"5 stars for the book, 1 star for the seller","I read the book in Math Library since I am interested in Liaison.Now the book is a little bit out-of-date, since in the last 10 years, there have been quite some progresses on Liaison.Still, the book gives the basic notions that one needs to know to be able to understand papers on Liaison.Therefore I found it very useful.On the other hand, I NEVER got the book, since the seller ""oddesseyy"" told me AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE that they did not have the book (after making me wait for quite some time).Summing up, the seller has been useless, but the book is great.Be careful if you need to buy a book from ""oddesseyy"". Especially if you are in a hurry, it is not very reliable seller."
4,Don't know!,"Thank you for the shipment which came in good time. We have not yet started our Bible Study, which will be in Sept. We studied Book 1 last year and enjoyed it so decided to take Book 2 this Sept. Thanks very much! I rated this item based on Book 1"
4,A Great Change of Pace.......,........for Dick Haymes. Would be 5 stars except I don't think the song selection is the best. But I love the small group backing and the quality that age has added to Mr. Haymes' great voice. You won't be disappointed.
1,Don't waste your money on this one.,"This ""guide"" to the Galapagos contains long, boring chapters on tour companies, logistics (including insightful advice such as ""bring lots of film"" and ""don't drink the water""), how to take photographs, and mainland Ecuador. There is a short chapter on Galapagos wildlife. Mr. Boyce owns Galapagos Travel, a tour company specializing in trips to the Galapagos. It is obvious that Mr. Boyce wrote this book for two reasons: (1) to establish himself as an ""authority"" on the Galapagos, and (2) to sell a copy to everyone who gets on one of his boats. Don't waste your money on this one. (I can't recommend his tour company, either.) If you are in the market for a good guide to the Galapagos, I highly recommend Michael Jackson's authoritative Galapagos: A Natural History Guide."
1,Bit thin on detail,Having packed several books to Galapagos I found this one to be the weakest. The information seemed out of date and the detail uninspired. Go for another.
1,Ignore this book.,Verbose and boring. Most information was extremely dated and useless. I had a very hard time organizing my trip until I bought another guide and found the correct information.
4,A Great Travel Companion,"This book was invaluable during my trip to the Galapagos. Unlike many guidebooks that contain out of date info, this book was current and a nice little reference book for both trip planning and island exploring."
3,Galapogos travel,"Product as advertised. Information good but based on 2004 data, not really current information for planned travel in 2008. This is the problem with printed reviews versus online data."
4,Love it,"We got the one with the umbrella and we are really happy to have purchased this table. It is great and our 2-year old loves it. We cut some blackboard cling paper and put it on the table, she loves writing in chalk on it. She eats, reads, paints, draws and put Elmo and Big Bird to sleep on this table. She visits her grandmother quite often, and we just fold the table up, and bring it to grandmas'. Everyone loves it. our little even wants to use the umbrella that came with it, on the shade. I would buy this table again in a heart beat."
3,sturdy and convenient,"We love little tikes in this house!!!I have two small children,run home daycare and a 9 year old all of them sit and eat outside at this table...we do art and several activities on it and not only is it sturdy it also has bright non-fading colors the only draw back for us is the cup holders...the younger kids spill there drinks trying to put the cups in the holder however there is a hole in the cup area so the spillage goes down the hole to the ground instead of all over the table"
4,trouble putting together,"I bought this table for my daycare and for my own 2 children. It is sturdy and durable. I like that it is large enough to seat 4-6 children comfortably. I had a heck of a time putting it together and the piece that hooks underneath snapped in two. I felt that it should have been much easier to assemble, so I am curious if I have a defected table. The thought of returning it and exchanging it does not thrill me...hassle...but it is together and sturdy. I just worry that when I fold it up I won't get it together again. I wonder if anyone else had difficulty with this. Other than that it is perfect!"
4,Nice table but not what it is advertised as,"Easy store insinuates that it is easy to fold up and store. In fact it says that right on the sticker attached to the table when new. It is anything but. It is extremely difficult to snap the flimsy plastic stays under the table into place. I can't believe I got them in there without breaking them. We have to leave the table up though, therefore we cannot fold it up and store it because it is absolutely, unequivocally IMPOSSIBLE to get the plastic stays back out once they are snapped in place without breaking them. This is a very poorly designed table. The dirt and kool aid collector in the center of the table wasn't such a smooth move either. For basic funtion and durability, the table is really great. Too bad the engineering flaws ruin what is otherwise a pretty good product."
2,Not so sturdy for...,"I purchased this table for my 2yr old son thinking it would last for a long time. I ordered this table as we needed something shipable via USPS (we live overseas-military family) and other tables are too big to ship. The table is great in that it is convinient. However, I don't feel it is very sturdy. My son isn't huge for his age but I feel as he gets older and gains more weight, the benches will start to buckle in the middle. I have tried to sit on it a few times (I'm not a large person either) and I feel like the seat is already bending. So I don't sit on the seats anymore which stinks because I bought the table to play games and do art projects with my son. I have friends who have the Step 2 picnic table and that one feels very sturdy and like it would never buckle. If I could do it over again, I would've just waited until we returned to the states to buy the Step 2 model."
4,Thumbs up!,Liked it for my toddler as well as gifts for other babies. It's the first book my son reaches out for. Although the little library board books are a little smaller than the other Eric Carles we have.
3,Great books..dead batteries,"These books are great except the book that has batteries in it didn't work. The book about fireflies lights up on the last page, but it takes 2 small batteries to operate. I had to purchase new batteries at a cost of $8 (Walmart price)."
2,Distorted Self-image?,"Sent this item back because the reflection in the mirror was distorted no matter what ""magnification"" I had it on. It's a nice concept (being able to twist and magnify with one mirror), but they need to work on the distortion. It's basically like a fun-house mirror that won't fog."
2,False advertising,The moment I started using the fogless mirror in the shower it fogged up on me. I thought wiping it down after each use might resolve the problem but there was no change. I would not recommend wasting your money on this product!!!
1,Just awful.,The mirror was distored and the light only shines on the bottom of your chin. I sent it back two days after I got it.
4,Best Overall performance...,"i have used the HP 4000 color laser jet for the past 3 years at my school's computer lab. I have tried all kinds of paper including a relatively light card-stock, transperancies, label stock and regular paper stock. I found the quality to be consistently good and the printer itself invariably reliable. Very few paper jams and even fewer printer malfunctions.It has descriptive error messages which are useful to someone who isn't too hardware savvy like me. And maintainance on the printer is not too difficult either. The cartridges and drum are front loading and easy to replace.When I started my own design group this past summer, the HP laserjet 4000 seemed like the perfect choice. But I find myself leaning more toward this model because its newer and has few more advanced features over the older model.So, even though I don't have any practical experience with this particular model, maybe my thoughts on the 4000 model are still useful!"
1,Do not buy - a piece of junk,I bought this along with three other sprinklers on line from amazon/toyzrus. it sprang a leak three days after I bought it - right on a major seam in the fish. DO NOT BUY. it's not worth my time/effort to return for a refund.
4,"Tastes pretty good, but not organic","These are pretty good chocolate covered raisins. The chocolate is not very sweet, and is almost a semi-sweet chocolate taste. The raisins are good, but not as good as organic raisins. Would be 5 stars if the ingredients were organic."
2,Boring,"This is quite possibly the worst fighting game I have ever played. Its a shame because I love the show. The battle system is just horrible. The game supposedly covers the series through the Cell Games, yet The Great Saiyaman is a character. Meanwhile, a host of other characters that should've been included were not. Just as the American version of the show has been changed into a kid's program, this game is also for children."
4,a perfect game!!!,"In this dragonball Z game you can choose different characters after you have unlocked them. My best character to choose is Frieza because he can do the Death Ball attack. The other characters are also good like Vegeta and the Final Flash attack. There are 4 different modes which are the Story mode, the Practice mode, the Duel mode, and the Tournament mode. So far my brother and I have unlocked all of the characters except for siayan man. This is a pretty good game. My brother got it as a Christmas present and so far it is a pretty good game."
1,Not worth it!!!,"I expected more out of Dragon Ball Z overall the show is the best but when it came to the game they really dissapointed me. It is a waste of your time and money and there is nothing good at all about the game, from the characters through the story its all [...] Who would actually play this game. If you do play this game you are a loooser and have no taste in quality games. So do yourself a favor and stick to the show-saturday nights at 10-GT is the [...]"
3,Great game if you like DBZ....,"This game is great if you like DBZ.If you don't like it I would not recommend it.There are alot of characters on this game which is a good thing.Sad thing is the fighting on it is pretty bad.Each character does the same move with a different name.It gets pretty boring.The moves on it are too hard to do, so you have to press start and refer to how to them each time you begin a game.So I don't recommend this game unless you are a big fan of Dragon Ball Z.I do recommend if you like DBZ to check out Ultimate Battle 22 the DBZ Japanse Import for the Playstion."
2,Was Expecting More,As a Dragon Ball Z fan I was expecting this to be one of the greatest fighters ever. Boy was I wrong. Although they do a good job of representing the show the game just falls flat. The graphics are bland and the enviorments are uninteresting. As for the gameplay it just can't compare to other fighters like the Tekken and Virtua Fighter series. You have a limited move set restricted to punches and kicks followed by a blast of energy. Because you can just fire off a ka me ha me ha at the end of a combo takes away the coolness of it all. Another problem is the ability to hit opponents while their down which is pretty cheap if you ask me. The game isn't all bad though. There are a host of unlockables all of which have to be bought from Mr. Popo. By the end of the game you'll hate Mr. Popo. The only reason this game will ever do well in sales is because DBZ has a large amount of over zealous fans.
4,This game should be better,"This was a preety good game, But it should be better.I mean the graphics rocked.Dragon ball gt was the first american dbz game.It even had majin buu.This one should of had more characters.This one should of been up to the buu saga.I thought it was boring.Not very challenging.I beat it in 1 hour.I like if ss3 goku was in there.The tranformation was bad.It wasnt the one on tv.It was to fast.In story mode you cant even fight as trunks.This game wasnt as good as dragon ball z ultimate battle 22."
3,A Good Attempt,"First and foremost, this game kicks butt. However, it is also one of the most annoying games I have ever played, myself being a hardcore DragonballZ fan. In this game, the story mode and duel mode are quit fun. However, in the tournament mode I found myself losing when I should have won. For one thing, your opponent will tend to knock you out of the ring even when you are blocking. Also, the big strong guys have the exact speed as a swift fast fighter. thus pulling off fast strong combos all the time. So, I found myself listening to the announcer saying,""Contestent Loses!"" in a happy voice over and over again. The story line is quit complete and is worth the effort. Also, the graphics are great. However, I think only a hardcore DBZ fan like myself would enjoy this (although I still was very annoyed in tournament mode). I just hope Funimation and Infogrames will try to make a better DBZ game some other time."
3,dimpo????????????,"first of all what did they do to this game wasnt it supposed to be the dragonballz game that was supposed to be the far best of all????second dimpo what kind of developer are they?infogrames just gave them the project so they can make a easy buck out of it.the minute i started playing i knew it was going to be boring.When you become super saiyan it takes so much of your energy that its almost imposible to stay super saiyan for a long time.you cant power up energy unless you hit your opponet, arent they supposed to lose energy fighting instead gain energy?the reason i gave it a 3 is its worth renting big time and even after those negatives its the best dragonballz game avalible"
4,loads of fun,"If you like the classic dbz story and are concerned about the original story line not being altered, this is the right choice for you. It's also loads of fun for a TRUE dbz fan, especially since you get the bonus levels"
5,excellent,My grandson loves the game very much there are no problems with this game.i give it 5tars for fun and 5 stars overall.
3,Not the best Dragon Ball Z fighting game,"This game is good. It has alot of good sides and downsides. This game isn't the best fighting game around, so if you don't really care for DBZ and just want fighting, this game is not for you. The controls are alittle hard to get used to, and the story mode is fun, but it takes some practice. This game has the voices from the show, so that's good if you're a DBZ fan. I know I'm a DBZ fan. There's a tournoment mode, but only for 1 player. You start off with only very little charactors, but as you complete chalanges in story mode, you get more charactors. The story mode is the best mode,I'd say. Overall, this game gets a 3/5"
4,Pretty good game,"Fans of Dragonball Z will not only claim that this is the best DBZ game ever, but most likely the greatest game ever. For those who are not fans of the the TV series, the game still holds its own. I for one am a fan of the the immensely popular TV show- and the game does stay true to the show. Pros of this game include the over-the-top moves such as the Spirit Bomb and Vegeta's Final Flash. The ability to customize fighters is also very well done as well as the fighters ability to transform during battle. I personally like the idea of collecting the 7 Dragonballs to get your favorite charcters their breakthrough ability. Cons against this the game are few. Number one, the World Tournament mode- your fighter gets knocked out of the ring very easily (very frustrating). Also I can't understand why they didn't include the the Majin Buu series in this game. All in all this is a very good game, especially if you are into DBZ."
4,For All Dbz LOVERS !!!,I Never liked Dragonball Z intill i saw this game!!! it is fun great graphics and Can do lots of cool moves. The fusion are Verrry funny and Hercules fusion with goku is verrry funny and cool this game is verry good if you like Dbz or not
4,DBZ!,"dragon ball z: budokai, is a good fighter, that every dragon ball z fan should own. the graphics are mediocre, but the animations are fairly fluid. the sound will make you feel like your watching the cartoon, good smacks and character yells are here! you get a good amount of characters to choose from, though not all of them are here. gameplay is simple, but fun, there are practice modes, tournement, and story modes. overall this game is fun, and will provide the casual gamer a good time, but dragon ball z fans will be very pleased!"
1,A game to last,Finally a Dbz game that is here to stay! I here that you get to be 24 charecters witch should be good and one of those characters is raditz thats a big reason why i'm getting this game radditz is awesome well anyway what i find funny is that Hercule is in this game which tells me infograms has a sense of humor or there amazingly stupid i think hercule's a waist of space if you ask me i also know that you get to become SSJ in the middle of a match wich is very cool and you get to use beams and fly. this game is very much like a remade version of ultimate battle 22 and final bout wich i have played both and they both are very good games.The games one big tournament and you compete in it and you win money and you use that money to buy moves for your player than you keep doing so and make you player as good as he gets than you get another player and get him the best he can get. Im definently getting this game.
4,It's Pretty Neat...,"My grandson, who is 10, plays this game alot. He likes it so much, he wants Boduki 2! It tells you the story of DBZ and you get to fight most of the important characters. But after you get far into the game, then you run out of things to do and it gets too hard. After you beat the main people, like Cell, and advance mode in Martial Arts Competition then there isn't much to do. But for the hours of fun it offers it is a good game. He plays it often and there is always something you can do on the game."
4,best,THIS GAME ROCKS I PLAY THIS GAME EVERY DAY UNLESH 60 BUT KICKING MOVES 23 MIGHTY CARCTERS AND I CANT WAIT UNTIL I GET MY DRAGONBALLZ BUDOKAI 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GeT tHe GaMe
3,This game is easy,Wassup this game is the easiest game i have ever played on my PS2. I picked it up the day it came out cause im a DBZ fan. I beat it in 1 hour. you will like the graphics are good but thats it. DBZ Budokai 2 is coming out in december so you gamers will have fun with that. It has way better graphics than the first.(It actually looks like the show)The only problem is that it only goos till the end of DBZ so its not that long.It is supposed to be way harder than the first and alot better. that is all.
2,You got half a hour,"This game is just weak, no strong quality that u would hope forpros:1 lots of dbz caracters2 fun for few secscons:1 waste of money2 it needs a adventure mode3 you will get tierd of it"
5,dbz rules!!!!!,ok. first of all on the islands level there is a secret cave! smash your opponent into the big rock and there it is!second of all this is an awesome game!!! buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,DBZ Budokai,"This game rocks!!! My dad even enjoys it we battle all the time!!!Its like one of those mortal kombat style games where you fight side to side but you can do much more. Their moves, etc.You can be like every character they show on tv from raditz to cell except for the saibamen and nappa and some of the ginyu force. I am gonna get budokai II"
3,fun but boring after you beat it!,"Ya go through story mode,training, edit skills, then legend of Hercule. In this mode you'll go through three storys in story mode- Sayian, Nameck and Android. If you've seen the show' you'll know what the chapters are. If not, buy the game. (or rent)"
4,YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!,"This is the ultimate dragonballz game out there! It has 5 different fighting modes so you can tear other fighters apart!You can customize your fighter to be the ultimate Z warrior in the world using the skills system. There are 23 playable characters( I have them all), from the saiyan saga(Raditz) to the cell games, and you have the Legendary of Hercules mode which lets you recreate the part about Hercules beating Cell instead of Gohan.(It's pretty funny!). You can use the spirit bomb, Big Bang attack, super kamehameha, and destructo disk. The only 2 flaws are that the moves are the same for every player (except their special moves like Goku's Warp Kamehameha) and there is no Buu saga.(MAAN!)There is also the incredibly cool burst mode. I'm tellin' ya man, this game is off da hook son! Even if ya don;t like DBZ, it's still an awesome fighting game! Move over Tekken!!!"
4,This game is sweet,I have beaten this game and it is my favorate game.My favorate chaecter is Vegeta but you have to unlock him.I also like Trunks but you don't get to use his sword.My favorate attack with Vegeta is the big bang attack it is a blast.There is a story mode so you are going to vs. Raditz and Cell. The final battle is the hardest level.You are Gohan but you are a super saiyan 2 and that is all I'm going to tell you.
4,Dragon Ball Z Budokai,Dragon ball z budokai rules same characters as the tv show but different voices. You can play up to the cell saga.The characters that you can unlock are Raditz Vegeta Nappa Hercule Gohan great saiyaman Teen gohan super saiyans yamcha androids 17 18 19 16 Cell Frieza Zarbon Dodaria Trunks Krillin Goku Tien and well almost all characters. there are 5 playable modes to play Story Duel world tournament practice edit skills options. YOU MUST BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUYBUY BUYBUYBUYBUYBUYBUYU THIS GAME IT IS AWESOME rICHARD SOURAIVONGSAA AND JEFF PANYANOUVONG.
1,dont play this game,"i was really excited when i found out that a new dbz game was going to be released. but i was disappointed. this game doesnt even go all the way through the sagas.i was amazed by the graphics which were great. the levels also dont seem to be to fun either. sure you can blow someone through a cliff and interact with the environment in other ways but its not much different from other fighting games like this. also the game does not have very many different attacks. i love vegeta but i didnt use him much because he doesnt have even half of his attacks that he should have. a lot of attacks are very similar too. the game is also very shallow. you can beat the game in a very small amount of time. there are quite a few characters but the game leaves a lot of them out. but it has almost every main character. enough said, dont buy this game. you could rent it, but expect to return it early because you will get bored. the show still rocks, though."
3,COOL,"This game is pretty fun if your a fan of the Dragon Ball series.The voice overs are amzing,but the game has some major draw backs the ps2 version is way to edited compared to the Jap. version,and don't even get me started on how censored tghe Gamecube version is. If you can understand Japanese get the jap version you'll thank yourself for getting the Jap. with all the gore."
5,Best Fighting Game Out There,"This is a awesome game! The graphics are great, the action is non-stop and it follows the whole story line from saiyan saga to cell games! I plan on gettin it sometime this week,out of all the fighting games out there.. you cant go wrong with this action packed fighting game. Dragon Ball Z Budokai"
5,The Best Game Out of All The Dragonball Z Games!,"This game is much fun. You can do alot of things in this game then the previous games.There are different modes in this game. I like the story mode, reason being is becuse, the villans don't make mistakes that is totally not them. Like do a kemehameha wave and you are on the opposite side of it. Other than that it is Superb.The grphics a whole lot better, controls are aquward but good.Sound, voices all good.The thing that interest me is the transformation. Instead of beating the whole game to unlock SS's,you can transform in to it. That really got my attention!"
4,THIS GAME IS THE !!BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I THINK THIS GAME IS COOL BECAUSE OF THE GRAFICS. I LIKE GOKU AND TEEN GOHAN BECAUSE OF THERE SPECIAL ATTACK. I LIKE TOURMENTBECAUSE YOU FIGHT ANYBODY. I ALSO LIKE BIG BANG ATTACK.
1,Dragon Ball Z Budokai is HORRIBLE,"Dragon Ball Z Budokai is horrible. The graphics are ok, but the gameplay is slow. I'm not a big Dragon Ball Z fan, but I do like good fighting games and this is not one of them. I would not recommend buying this game, if you are DBZ fan then you might want to rent it."
4,THIS GAME SUCKS,WAIT FOR THE SECOND dragonball z budokai 2 comes out 12/03 thats in december for all you who are not the sharpest tools in the shed well i am off so buy the second one not the first the first sucks compared to this!!!!
2,very disappointing,"now you have to think here... what exactly does dragonabllz supposed to consist of? if you are a true dbz fan like myself this game doesn't have any capability to the original show. i mean come first of all none of your special moves are controllable!! you have to do a combo to pull off a kamehameha which doesnt make any sense. how many times have you seen gokuu krillin or gohan pop off a three hit combo before being able to do there move. dont get me wrong it looks cool and all but it just aint right? oh my god and Mr. Popo's shop was the most annoying thing ever created!!! i went in and out of that shop over 300,000 times and i still haven't got the dragonballs enough times to receive the special capsules, but if you are an americanized dbz fan i guess it is good enough for ya'll!!"
2,A shallow game that was about what I had expected,"Dragonball z Budokai is not a game for the original fans of the series. By that I mean fans of the series that were into it before it was on cartoon network and before it became ""americanized"". Let me be blunt about this...if your a dubbie, and got started on it watching the FUNi version, then you'll probably think this game was good enough to spend 50 bucks on...but if your like me and was a fan of the original series before it became popular in the states, you'll probably be kicking yourself in the head after about an hour of play. graphics-3, story-4, gameplay-2, replay-2. This game wouldn't have been nearly as bad with some alterations to the combat engine and a Japanese langauge option. The one saving grace for this game has to be the story mode, its been done pretty well."
3,A flawed single player game.,"Dragon Ball Z: Budokai was a very fun game at first, but after the three hours I played it, I realized it was both repetitive and easy to play. I had a lot of fun getting all of the characters, which there were many of, but I quickly got bored with the stale fighting system, which, when you started, had only punches, kicks, and kamehameha.The multiplayer, on the other hand, was great. Fighting against friends who obviously spent too much time on it made it really challenging. Of course, if you spend too much time playing it, you can become unbeatable, with moves like ""Cell's Spaceship"", which gives you an extra life, while the other guy is half dead. While this was a fun game, you won't get much play out of it."
5,Best Of DBZ!!,"I'm picking when it comes to games and this one is one of the best I've ever seen. If you are or aren't a fan buy it, rent it, play it, love it."
4,The best of the best,"This game is awesome. You start out as goku, piccolo, kid gohan, krillin, and tien. It is not hard to unlock the rest, except Great Saiyaman. You can redo each character. It is confusing at first, but after you play it for awhile you will get the hang of it. For frieza, buy his space ship and die, you will become mecha frieza. The reason this is not a true 5 is because there is no buu saga. And because goku hardly has any moves. If you buy this game, get the strategy guide, it really helps. Buy it now and have fun."
4,dbz fans will be pleased,"This game is by far the best dbz game their is.But the reasons I didn't give it a 5 is the graphix ,and you cain'tjump!! The graphix are good but could be better.The story mode is really fun.It's kind of like you are watching the show.The characters sound just like they do in the show.If you are a dbz fan like me,get it!!If not,rent it first.Overall it's a good game."
2,Like Rockem-Sockem robots!,"With the sophistication possible in today's video games, Budokai falls short. It fails to offer real quality in the progressive levels of difficulty that make so many other games satisfying for months of excellent gaming. We paid $50 for this game because of the ""Z"" name. Initial excitement was high, but we quickly tired of it and no longer play."
5,THIS BOOK LEAVES A GREAT TEACHING!,"Your personality is yours and no real change is needed!But with this book, you can enhance it and the sky is the top!It teached me how to be myself, only better!And to feel secure of my own personality !"
5,Away Down In Dixie!,"This is a wonderful CD, full of some great, and unique quicksteps. Some favorites are present on the disc as well, as some new ones to myself. The selections come directly from the 19th Virginia's books! A buddy and I recently listened to this CD on the way home from a civil war reenactment, and we agreed that the music was great, and it was made even better by the fact that every other song a narrator came up to describe the upcoming or past song."
5,Works great!,"I really like the features of this scale, especially the multiple-person memory, which allows for all members of the family to track their weight goals. It might cost a little more than other scales, but it is definitely worth it!"
1,Broke within a year.,"The scale was good when it worked. The company would fix it for free if I sent it to them, but not worth the shipping cost."
4,wow,I was tired of my old scale with a shaky pointer so I ordered this its soo high tech and has everything you could want in a scale..i like it a lot.
3,It's a complete shame!,"Well, this is a beautiful performance, it is a shame the sound qualiy is SOOOOOOOO BADDDD!!!!!! . I Have a old recording of Maria Callas in ""Lucia..."", which is supposed to be recorded in a somewhat similar way than this, and it sounds SPARKLING clear when compared to this recording. unfortunately, it sounds VERY blurry. Reminds me a lot of old tape.to-tape-to-tape recordings.. If you don't mind, it is a beautiful performance, and its CHEAP. But if you mind sound, well........."
2,Where's the beef?,"While the soprano and tenor arias are superb, the baritone is clearly off from his reputation and peak performance time. His stuff at the end of the second act is positively painful. Another disablilng problem is that the recording of the chorus and orchestra are so distorted as to make even familiar passages very difficult to recognize. If you are satisfied with great Corelli and Price performances, this is not going to bother you but the baritone and choral material is why I listen to this opera."
4,The best Computer for schools,"I think it is the best computer for School, no too big to too heavy, the speed it realy good."
3,Great System with Some Light Leakage,"I have to be up-front here - I bought a different model Toshiba - the M105-S3041, from Amazon last month. This laptop, the M105-S3064, uses the same case and display as my laptop. I was initially very happy with it. However, I must caution any potential buyers that the LCD on this system has a lot of light leakage. Otherwise a great little system for the money, though."
5,Great laptop; Great price!,"For the price paid, this machine really does the job. Fast, good features & productivity, great widescreen display. Outstanding wireless connectivity. Only trouble I had was the fingerprint digital recognition system, since it had an installation problem (laptop doesn't recognize the digital device). Easy burning of cd's and dvd's. I think the cd/dvd feature where you can play music/movies without having to turn on the computer is one of the most enjoyable features of this laptop. Perhaps the only drawback is that it doesn't come with Microsoft's Office. If you invest in this laptop for a 2-3 year productivity period, you're getting your money's worth; for sure the laptop will last longer, assuming you treat it well. Buy it!"
4,this that and more,"After reading a magazine article on them, I thought I would check it out. The comparison to Portishead is a way off, though. Spicehouse has more of an upbeat sound, actually quite heavy at times. The heart of this CD is the droning grooves that are very appealing. I like many of the songs on this CD but am a bit partial to the longer spacey-jam songs like ""Caravan,"" ""Mask"" and ""Blow."" The unique electronics mixed with soprano sax makes for a strange listening experience. All in all, I like the Trip-Hop/Chill/DownTempo very much, but like most of the people I talk to, it is starting to get boring. ""Tomorrow is the Answer"" is an intelligent and multi-layered album under the trip-hop umbrella that combines trip-hop, electro-jazz, world-fusion and even more influences to produce an uncommon sound. If you are the kind of person who is a bit outside the mainstream, you should check this out."
4,Nice Album,I have grown to really like this album a lot. This CD has some really nice vocal harmonies as some of it's strong points. I think what I like best is the soulful grooves that run through the whole album.
4,Trip Hop cross over,"This is a nice album I would recommend to anyone looking for some new music or a puppy. This album is one of the better ones I have come across - it's kind of a cross over (not pure trip-hop, there are a lot of styles here), but it makes the transition in a great way. The music on discs 1 and 2 are quite a bit different from each other. Disc 1 is more on the catchy-trip-hop-dance-like side, while disc 2 is much more ""out there."" My friends and I like to think of ourselves as fairly wide in our musical taste. We think Spicehouse is really on to something. It takes a special kind of band to keep me interested. The way they have pulled off this sexy, worldly, jazzy sound and kept it interesting is innovative and magical! They remind me of ""Zero Gravity."" Rarely, do I find a CD that I feel I got ALL my money's worth (at two hours+, this is a not a bad value)."
3,good,I didn't like FUN-Damentals I found it kind of dull! it was just Brooke and Gunnar showing you different movements nothing exciting I think it's better for beginners GIVE ME 20 was good
2,Not much of a workout,This is not much of a workout.One explains the fundamentals of the ball and the other is a small workout.
2,pretty good,I enjoyed the story of Tom Quick and don't miss the gestapo like orders of George Washington to erase the Deleware Indians from the face of the earth.
4,Inspiring Misdemeanors.,"This book is poorly written, but I'm doubt that anyone is buying it for that. There is a nice chronological progression of pictures of various examples of grafitti - some of the stuff at the beginning of the book looks like real trash to me, but towards the end the bigger production pieces are really inspiring. I mean, how many ways can you write your moniker? Apparently the sky is the limit. This book is sure to inspire an idea or two into aspiring illustrators since ""Bad artists copy. Good artists steal."" (from the book) heh heh heh."
5,i keep picking it up.,"filled with full color imagery from early graffiti days of the late 60's to works from last year. Oldschool and newjacks will all see something they can feel connected to. The example driven chapters give a feeling there is always room for more rather than a definitive wrap up of this hugely growing subculture.The book is unique in that its not an introduction it's more of an advanced course.the art of getting over is more than pictures and stories that it contains, it is the appreciation that recognizes there are many stories untold and to unfold in this graffiti game.big up to espo and the urge to see your name on the blvd."
4,Borish speaks...,"I thought that ESPO did a great job in creating this book. He took it from a different point of view, from a fellow artist's point of view. He took us back through history, from old Philly style to NY and then took us to the present with writing bout today's greats. But I thought that he could of done a little history on the old school Chicano/Pachuco styles that began in the West in the 30's y 40's. But still a great job by ESPO and still a great book. Support our struggle and buy his book"
1,THE ART OF GETTING OVER,ESPO'S THE ONE GETTING OVER ON THIS ONE. THAT'S WHY WE RAN HIS WEAK STUFF OUT OF PHILLY CUZ HE'S WACK. LEDGENDARY ARTISTIC WARRIORS ARE THE ONES PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO LEARN ABOUT. THE RICH PAST AND SCHOOL YARD HERO'S. NOT ART SCHOOL ZERO'S. PLEASE CAN ANYONE ELSE DO A BETTER JOB BECAUSE TOO MANY HAVE SHED BLOOD AND DONE TIME FOR THE BELOVED GRAFF GAME.
2,Scratching on the wall,"This book rides totally on the surface of the misunderstood subculture of graffit writers. It fails to address the larger social issues of alienation and angst that most serious graffiti writers feel. Lots of snapshot style pictures that aren't that great considering the subject matter. It's basically a book by a graffiti writer for other graffiti writers. It's strange that for all the attention graffiti writers seem to so desperately to need, their intentions after all is said and done are very shallow.They have no great cause or social statement to make. If you want to see graffiti that's real, you won't find it in this book"
3,"yes ,it's alright","this book is good if you're doing a report and good if you're like major fan. But to all the people who said that this book shows how stuck up she is, than that shows that you're just jealous and what the hell are you looking at this website for anyways if you hate her? And why did you read the book if you hate her? g2g"
5,It's a great book!,"I bought this book at tower records in october or november of 2000 and it is a great book!It has all kinds of facts on her life and her favorite things!I think it's one of the best books on a singer that has been made!I just love it and i'm hooked on it!I read this book alot!And i also have five other books on christina and they're all great, but this now is the best one i have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I just can't belive any of you people can rate this book only 1,2,3,4stars!And you call yourselves christina fans!HUH!I also think it's great because at the back it has a test on her that you can take to see if you're a real fan or just a new one!So for anyone who wants to know if they should get this book well get it!You'll love it and think it's just a really great book!Well that's all and I just want to say that i'm christina's #1 fan and I always will be!!!!!!Christina's #1 forever and (not) Britney !"
3,"ok, some errors..........","This book have one wonderful interview w/ christina, and some of her favorite things, plus a quiz if you are a true fan. The one dissapointment is the grammar errrors. Obviously, someone didn't proofread Come on Over very well. Other then that, you will love the pics of Christina, which is worth the price alone!"
4,Traffic Calm down,I bought this to make my drive to and from work more relaxing. It helps to prevent any road rage.
5,This is AWESOME music!!!,I love Jesse Cook! This album is a must have for anyone who like great music.
4,An eclectic mix of hot acoustic guitar work,"Jesse Cook's ""Vertigo"" quite simply lives up to his name, it ""cooks"". You've got to think that the song ""That's Right"" that opens the CD is just flat out catchy, ""kick-butt"" music with Buckwheat Zydeco calling the signals. Other tracks are crafted with the utmost care, from ballads to Flamenco saturated ""jazz"", this is a an enjoyable disc that will probably want to make you want to add to your Jesse Cook compilation, if it it does'nt already exsist. The gentleman can play guitar."
5,Something different and excellent,"I'm a fan of flamenco rythms because of my Spanish origin and I love many performers like Vicente Amigo, Paco de Lucia, Strunz & Fara, Ottmar Liebert, and many more but Jesse Cook seemed to me very different from the others., He has a special gift for Spanish guitar. I feel saciated and invigorated listening to his work. Unfortunately I only could get here in my country Vertigo, that is perfect, but I'll try to ask a friend in USA to send me another one. Highly recommended album."
1,There is no such thing as a flamenco purist,"Flamenco from the start has always been about fusion, the mixing of the Gypsy with the Andalusian, the folkloric with the creation of the old with the new. Contrary to some uniformed Americans, Flamenco is not a dead art; it is in constant evolution. Jesse Cook is a good artist but what he does isn't Flamenco in any shape or form. His playing is closer to Manitas de Plata."
4,Stylish and Effective,"I was excited when I was offered the OXO Wine Stopper/Pourer to review. I really loved the sleek design of the OXO Wine Stopper/Pourer. I am an occasional wine drinker, and this stopper/pourer worked wonderfully for me. I do not store open bottles of wine on their side, so did not have trouble with any leakage. It did drip a little bit after pouring, but that was not a major concern to me. I am very pleased with this product."
5,Works as it should,Very handy product and highly durable. It's stainless so you don't have to worry about it corroding and it pops right in the dishwasher when your done. I haven't found a better stopper yet.
1,Leaks - returned it,"I bought this from Sur Le Table, and like many others, i found this to be a beautiful product, looks good, visually it seems to be well-made, but it leaks around the hinge. Returning it."
5,Very sturdy,"I have some wine stoppers but this is my first experience with a stop/pourer. I really liked it! It is very sturdy and does not leak. At first, the leverage was a bit hard but once I placed it in the mouth of the wine bottle, it worked great. I normally don't have several bottles of wine opened at the same time so I might not buy more than one more of this, but I do like it. And like other reviewers said, I too agree on having good care of it, maybe not throw it in the dishwasher? Overall, very pleased with it."
1,leaks - don't buy this,It's too small for conventional sine bottles and leaks. It leaks when it pours and it's intentional design is lost on its poor engineering.
1,Bought 2 of them and both leak from the knob...,I was disappointed by this product. After pouring the wine with the bottle tilting back the wine will actually leaks in between the black and silver parts... I have tried two of them and both leak. I'm calling the customer service. Nice idea and design but didn't work well.
1,It leaked,"I usually love OXO products, and have lots of them in my kitchen cabinets, so this looked good when we needed a new wine stopper. Unfortunately, such was not the case: when I tried to pour wine from the bottle, it leaked all around the stopper. Don't know the cause of the problem, but I've thrown the stopper away."
4,Use Mine As An Olive Oil Pourer/Stopper!,"I use this pourer/stopper for dispensing olive oil, not wine, and love the control it gives me. It fits nicely into the opening of a cleaned out, dark glass beer bottle. The bottles area easily replaced and the spout itself is very easy to clean. I've also purchased the newer OXO oil pourer/stopper but I haven't used it yet."
3,Nice Wine Gadget.,"This is a good wine stopper by itself, and allows you to pour wine without removing it. If you're looking for a small gift for a wine enthusiast, this would be appreciated, but I personally don't mind removing a traditional cork or stopper and pouring wine the old fashioned way."
5,I like everything about it,I already had a very elegant looking wine bottle stopper/pourer but I rarely used it because it was so difficult to remove from the bottle. Even my big strong son in law had a hard time trying to get it out. This OXO stopper/pourer goes in easy and comes out easy. I also really like that it opens and closes with a lever instead of a removable plug like my old one has.
4,Worked fine for me,"what can i say? they're plastic, quiet, and they fit just right in my explorer. would've been cool if they included screws, nuts, and washers."
2,Not Great,"Like others have said these adapters have 5.25"" cutouts (or close to) which requires trimming to fit a 6.5"" speaker. They are made of a pretty flimsy plastic which vibrates at higher volumes unless coated in deadener (which I recommend if you actually rig them to work). I ended up snapping one while installing but ghetto rigged it until I can find some decent 6x8's so I can toss these. If you NEED an adapter I suggest taking up some novice wood working and fabricating one out of mdf or something of similar quality. These are not worth the hassle."
4,"Entertaining, distinct, but still 1-hour American police drama","This show is based on the British police drama by the same title, but it's distinctly American, and Maria Bello does a great job keeping you on the hook. I enjoyed the set-up, and I enjoyed Aidan Quinn's character and his fiery personality. I believe that some of the male characters who are angry on various levels that a woman is in their midst will become fleshed out to reveal aspects that will endear them to us a little more. However, it is also a 1-hour American police drama, and nothing's going to change that. Somewhere in the middle of the story something pops up, the heroine gets a connection, and voila! the guilty criminal is found by the end of the hour even though things are way more messy and complicated in real life."
2,Disappointing,"Helen Mirren proved to be too hard to equal, much less improve upon. A few reasonably good episodes in the series, which did improve as the season progressed, but I wouldn't be interested in watching Season 1 again."
4,Prime Suspect streaming video version...,"I was pleasantly surprised at this show. Americanizing one of my favorites (Helen Mirren) had to be difficult , but Marie Bello fills the shoes. I still prefer the BBC stories though. Americans are always having the faerietale ending and the original is still my favorite if I had to choose. Will continue to watch this show and enjoy. As I do not have TV I cannot comment on how the streaming version may differ if at all."
3,neutral,"Prime Suspect Pilot- i want need neutral , this is a try? the episodes have the same quality ? will be one season ?"
5,NBC blew it !,"This series hooked me from the first episode and NBC canceled it ? BOO ! bad move ! the characters were unique and believe me, Helen Mirren is a tough act to follow, but I loved Maria bello !I would have been a very loyal follower. Maria, you rock !"
5,SUPER GREAT STARS ON THIS SERIES!,WATCHED EVERY EPISODE. THIS IS A GREAT SHOW ! PURCHASED THE SEASON . I WISH THEY WOULD PUT IT BACK ON THE AIR!
4,A Great Remake of a Great Series,"Being a big fan of the original series with Helen Mirren, I didn't expect to like the American version, but this show is great! I can't understand why it wasn't picked up for a second season. The characters are complex and interesting, the plots are captivating, and the cast does a great job. It's sad there aren't more episodes."
5,Maria Bello,I loved this pilot episode to Prime Suspect. I was disappointed that the show was cancelled but at least I can watch this again if I should choose in my video catalog on my Kindle.
2,The Student Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI),Kouzes & Posner books are great! This particular LPI was only tangently useful for our particular leadership course.
5,ND Replica jersey,Just what I was looking for without the hasssle of shopping around. Great price and delivered to my door!!
5,a great cd,I have Mortal Treason's demo cd and have seen them play many times. They're awesome live and they always fire up the crowd which results in a brutal pit. I had been waiting several months for this cd to come out and finally got it at their cd release party and it did not disappoint me. I suggest to anyone who has an interest in hardcore music to buy this cd and support this great band.
2,"Sorry, but this was not helpful for me...","I am kind of blown away by the other reviews, maybe they were set up or something? The CD is very relaxing and I used it once or twice a day as it stated. And the author is right, you will pick up something different each time. But my mind could not get away from some of the very odd comments on this CD, for instance, she asks you to consider and feel each part of your body and when she gets to your knees, she mentions you 'might feel discomfort or tightness there'. Why in the world would she state something negative about that body part, when you are going to listen to it daily? I was afraid I WOULD start having some psychosomatic knee pain because of it! Kind of joking there, but how odd. And the carbeurator comment...she spends way too much time getting you relaxed and too little time addressing the issues. I found it odd, and unhelpful. Just one point of view though, you might like it if you have bad knees."
4,Funny funny funny,"Two guys go on a quest to lose their virginity, find a box with marijuana grown with herbs that turn it into an instant aphrodisiac. When they hear the sirens of a police car they chuck their sure thing out the window. The hilarity ensues as they attempt to find their lost herb and make it to a party where they can score."
2,Only portions in 3D,"This disk has both a 2D version and a '3D' version of this 'film'. In 2D, this is a really bad movie. As for the 3D, only about 1/2 of the film is actually presented in 3D. It alternates between that and some simulated 2D mess that gives no 3D effect whatsoever. The puzzling thing is whether it was the fault of the filmmakers or poor authoring of the DVD the resulted in the horrible pseudo-3D portions. It appears to be a filmmaker problem, as the 2D and 3D comes and goes a key plot points (if there is such a thing as a key plot point in a movie like this!). Basically a poor man's American Pie, this time with watermelon instead of an apple pie."
4,Carving Is Easy With Hamilton Beach Electric Knife!,"Like a lot of people, I don't mind baking a Ham or Turkey but when it comes to carving...well that is another story. I always used a traditional carving knife. One of my friends suggested the Easy Slice Electric Knife and now I don't mind carving dinner right in front of people. It is so easy to use! The blades clean up easily and the price can't be beat!"
2,ELECTRIC KNIFE,"I have two different electric knives. One is with a straight shaft and the trigger under the front. The Hamilton Beach has a handle over the main shaft with a trigger on top of that handle. I find this considerably more difficult and awkward to use. I love carving with electric knives and recommend its use for turkeys, hams, homemade bread, and other meats."
5,Good knife,"I have used many Hamilton Beach products and I find them very reputable. Before this we had a toastmaster knife for two months but it was terrible. This hamilton beach is very sharp and powerful, i told all my relatives to get one too and they love theirs. I highly recommend it. It is great on roasts, chickens, turkeys everything."
5,Love Leo Hartas!,"Mr. Hartas's work is always creative & imaginative. My sons spend a lot of time with the details of the illustrations as they imagine, discuss and draw their own versions. A book that inspires young minds - What more can you ask?"
3,Not consistent,"I ordered two of these racks and one was perfect and the other was bent in the front. With limited time to deal with returns while preparing for the holidays, I was disappointed."
5,Great Quality Fair Price,"I actually bought these racks for my bathroom to get products off my counter (thank you pinterest!) work wonderfully. Great quality, nice look to them. Definetly will pick up a few more when we redo our kitchen in a few months."
5,Makes organizing stylish!,"My only complaint is that the screws are too long. To solve this we gorrilla glued a 1/4"" piece of wood into the back of the cabinet, stained it and then used the screws to go into that piece of wood. We also added washers and then used more gorrilla glue to secure the screws permanently. We have a small kitchen so this was a really great buy to help keep us organized. I love it! Worth the extra attention to make it work!"
4,Perfect for Spices,"I love these racks. They are perfect for organizing spices in the kitchen. I recently moved from a house that has an extra corner cabinet that was perfect for all of my ""40"" spices, so at the new house with not as much space, these racks were perfect to mount on the wall next to the stove to save space & organize. The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star was that I has ordered 5 of these then realized I needed 2 more and when I went to reorder just a couple of weeks later, the price has jumped $4.03 each! So I ended up paying for 2 what I had just paid for 5."
5,A Must Read,Brazen is a must read. It's down right real! Can't wait for another book from this author.
1,Provided little original insight on unified messaging,"It was so ridiculously simple that it wasn't very interesting.There was no mention of messaging standards, the Internet's impact onmessaging or the future of messaging. This book was a combination of three things: a list of basic unified messaging features, a plug for the MaiSoft product and an installation guide for the product. The list of features is good first step for beginners, but many are pretty obvious for anyone who has used a voice mail system or e-mail system. The installation guide is only useful for people who purchase the MaiSoft software, and they get it with the product anyway. Going through the installation wizards taught me, a non-customer, very little about unified messaging. Also, the ""cute"" writing style gets very old, very quickly."
5,CorningWare 2 Quart Onyx Covered Dish,Wife loves it. Great buy. Exactly what we needed. Would use this seller again.
5,"its a good book, people shouldnt be affended.","not only is Burned an excellent book, but all of her books are wonderful and are worth my time to read!shes an amazing author."
4,Burn rubber to get Burned!,"Burned was an amazing book that is worth reading. It is yet another wonderful example of Ellen Hopkins writing. Though it isn't as good as Crank, it is still great.This book should only be read by mature audiences though. It is also more for girls than guys in my opinion. I think you will also need an open mind to fully appreciate the book."
3,I HATE THIS BOOK!!!,"Despite my distaste for this book, i can't give it a 1. The writting was nice as well as the characteriztions. It's not really poetry but the story does flow well.IT'S JUST SO DEPRESSING!! As is most of her other stuff. I saw alot of my friends reading her books and decided to try it. Big mistake. The plot and tragedies in this book is too much for me. I commend the authour for writting about reality and bringing the issues of abuse (all forms) to the public. It just makes me mad when i can't do anything about it, even if it is fiction because stuff like that happens all too commonly. And i've already seen too much of it in my own family growing up in the projects. I read to keep myself sane in this awful world, because sometimes you just need a break from reality. That being said this story is i'll(reluctantly)admit a decently written story.I just wouldn't reccomend it to anyone contemplating suicide thats for sure (or anyone else)."
2,Not for young adults,"After reading the book as an adult I was really depressed and experienced a feeling of hopelessness. My feeling is that the author is still really angry and one picks up this anger when one is reading this book. Therefore, I think it is way to heavy for young adults."
3,Good.. unitl the last few pages,I really enjoyed the first 478 pages of this book. For me though the ending just didn't do the story justice.
3,good but not her best,"Burned was a moving book about feeling out of place and finding a new one, i myself could relate to the book, feeling out of place. I couldnt put it down. Its a good book i thought that there would be a different ending that would be a little more fufilling."
4,"Great book, abrupt ending","I thought this was a great book. It gave great insight of the horrors of abusive families. It also explained a lot about how a persons point of view can be completely changed when they are not forced into doing something. It is a great love story. I thought this book had a very abrupt ending. It seemed like everything was semi-okay, and then all of a sudden a tragedy occurs and then the book is pretty much over. Nonetheless, a great book. Hope this helps!"
5,Amazing and Emotional,"This is another amazing book by the wonderful Ellen Hopkins, who, after reading her first book, Crank, had made herself my favorite author - even over J.K. Rowling! The story is amazing, realistic, emotional, the writing was beautiful, and at some points, even better than Crank. This book was well-done, and was a little slow until around page 75, then was all fast-paced and captivating until the last page! I cannot wait for the sequel, Smoke, which shall be coming out in 2013!"
4,True love never dies... or does it?,"Wow. This book was soo good. I love all of Hopkin's writings, so I knew this one would be good, but it was alot better than I imagined! I loved the story line... but the ending was just too quick. I felt like I was reading this great story then I just sat the book down and stopped reading; like there should be more to this story. But other than that this was a really good read~! =)"
4,Very Good Book,"Even though the format of the book is odd (and paper wasting) it is a very good book. Very easy to read format. I normally don't like anything but monster/horror/sci-fi, but this was a really good book. It is about a Mormon girl (my best friend is Mormon) and her life. She has a dad who drinks and beats his wife. The girl starts to question life, God and religion, things we all think about at 16. She ends up with her aunt and finds life. I won't give it away, you have to read it. The ending is VERY sad and final. I was hoping after all the poor girl has been through, the end would be happier. Still a good read!!!!"
5,Blew My Mind!!!,"The most provocative, compelling, beautiful book I have ever read. It absolutely blew my mind! Made me fall in love with prose style writing again!"
5,This book is oz!,"if u want to know wat oz is, its the most awesome anything can get. Nothing is more amazing than oz. Burned is a book in free verse and it was the first time i ever read a book like that. It was very easy to read and understandable. There are so many things that happen that are shocking and unbelivable. So you should read this book, becasue it is OZ!"
3,great book terrible ending,this book was so good and i flew through it in one day but i have never been more pissed off by an ending of a book like this book. i understand not all books have good and happy endings but i have never been so let down by a book ending. not nessecary at all and i feel like i wasted my time reading the book.
3,maybe pick a different one,"the book is a sperratic, nonsensical view of a Nevada small town mormon girl's life. rebellion and then some soft loving notes aren't enough to save this book. it is so low in the totem pole compared to Ellen Hopkins' other books. especially if you are a big fan of the Crank series books, like i am. This one is a very mellow version of the same stuff that is in all of the other one's; a bad childhood, love and rebellion, then everything goes wrong and nothing get better. this one can definitely be skipped over.-Larisa S"
1,I tried to keep an open mind.,"I tried to give Ellen Hopkins the benefit of the doubt when she started in with the anti-Mormon jabs on page 3 of Burned, I really tried.As I read through the manuscript it became clear she had no first hand knowledge of Mormons and their beliefs. I don't know where she did her research but she got most of it wrong in the belief and practice department, or twisted it to suit her story line. She got so much wrong that I am afraid she is creating and condoning hatred. The ending certainly clinched the anti-Mormon thought process. To justify violence under the guise of artistic license and free speech is very, very scary. Too bad. She has talent and could have otherwise told a good story."
2,Didn't really notice a difference,"Have been using this product for about a month and have not noticed any difference. Kind of disappointing, but always willing to try new things at least once."
2,A good introduction.,But that's probably about the extent of what can really be said about it. I think this more-or-less meant to be a coffee table book as it contains a lot of photos. The author deals with the subject matter in a sort of superficial way that doesn't really delve too deep into the motives behind the use of certain principles - thankfully that subject matter can be found in other books. The one thing I took away from the book was merely an understanding that their were practices in many cultures around the world that dealt with putting the spiritual symbolically into their architecture.
1,"Boring, boring, boring!","I have never read a more boring book. This book is not a well developed as many of the other Star Trek books. This book is about Riker and how he doens't know that he's on a ship with many androids. Well please you don't need to know anything about this book. Read Imzadi, if you're really curious about Riker, it's a lot better."
3,"Not bad, good Star Trek entertainment","""Spartacus"" is an interesting novel that explores the attitudes of organic intelligence versus machine intelligence, specifically androids. When do intelligent machines cease being property and instead acquire the same rights as organic beings? This TNG novel does a fair job of exploring this question.While the novel is a bit talky at times, overall this is good Star Trek TNG entertainment for a lazy afternoon."
4,Historic!!!,"This was a wonderful piece of prose as it reiterates the fight for freedom one of our most cherished rights, using the Spartacans (androids) as the Protagonists. It also restates eloquently the case against prejudice. It shows the demand for respect by all people in a most interesting & entertaining manner. In short ""I want nothing more and, I will accept nothing Less"""
4,Crossing Letterhead,"I am a pastor at a small church. I have used these Crossing letterheads as Baptismal Certificates, and have had many positive comments. Our church seal we imprint on the lower right corner. The matching envelopes are a plus."
4,Excellent autobiography of an American visionary,"Read how Avis beat Hertz in the rental car game. No, they weren't bigger. Remember, ""We're number 2, so we try harder."" But they were the first to move into the airports, and dominated that space long enough to become an institution in the rental car field.Warren Avis was successful in many other businesses. His sound thinking and fearless risk taking helped him in each endeavor.Smart and brave - a winning combination."
2,"Cute, but not dishwasher safe.","My kitchen has a sunflower motif, so these items were a really cute addition. However, I put the spoon rest in the dishwasher, and after a couple of cycles, the paint came right off. I would warn anyone who purchased this to hand wash."
3,OK,"This table does its job, but the wood is not the greatest quality. I guess I should expect more considering what we paid for it."
2,Sucks,"For race car fans with a heavy duty twist and special affects this 2 part movie(s) are a 'sinful amusement'. Heavy action on car scenes with violence everywhere and four-letter words in every sentence. Very little T+A, if that is what your looking for. Part II should BE part I regarding the 'story line'. Of course my copy could have very well been a pirate copy. Not worth buying, maybe a cheap rental."
3,Broken ribbon,I have ordered this item in the past and everything was fine. This time the ribbon first ribbon broke after one day of use. The second ribbon has worked fine. I should receive one free one.JEM
1,Company Never Lets You Purchase More Than One Time,"Lame company. I purchased the 2 pack of Brother 1230 Correction Ribbons for my son's typewriter back in November 2009 and when I went to get another 2 pack in March 2010, the company wouldn't allow me to purchase additional ribbons claiming I got my one and only 2 pack that I could ever purchase. Maddening!"
2,It does not print dark enough,"It does not print dark enough, and there is no adjustment on the Brother typewriters to make it print darker, like there is on the Smith Corona's ones. Had to go to the Multi-Stike ribbon."
5,BROTHER SPIN-WHEEL ERASEABLE TYPEWRITTER,"I HAVE WANTED A TYPERTRER FOR YEARS!!! YES, THIS MORE THAN MEETS Y EXPECTIONS !!! IT'S COMPATABLE TO THT IBM ""SELECRTIC"" EVEV IN THESE DAYS, A ""OLD FASHIONED"" TYPWITTER IS ESSENTIAL."
2,very very old yellow package,"this was christmas gift for a mentally challanged cousin who types alot for a hobby, and I was almost to ashamed to give it to him as part of his gifts."
3,Needles & Notions,Needles & Notions is OK. It did not meet my requirements for the project I had in mind but would be good for other quilting or patchwork. My fault NOT the book. When I get more experienced hopefully I will know what to look for in a book. Please don't let this deter you from buying this book.
4,Scott Walker Fans,I bought this to get the last of Scott Walkers out put from the 1970's in my collection and tracks 16 through 18 do so with Scotts input to the Walker Brothers album Nite Flights. It also contains some obscurities from that period of the Bros. career. Well worth the price (less that $10 including shipping) for the volume.
4,"Eclectic, technically-innovative CD that stretches your mind","Anyone interested in the guitar as a musical instrument will find much to admire in this CD. The CGT expand your musical appreciation for the instrument that many of us think we know so well by covering everything from Beethoven to Classical Gas in ways that highlight the richness of the guitar in this all-instrumental CD. By using innovative tuning techniques, they manage to produce a wider range of notes which delights the ear as well as the mind. This is not just a CD for background music (though many may use it that way), but also a fine example of the musical diversity the guitar is capable of. Robert Fripp produces."
3,bon,il y a de meilleurs albums je préfères CG3+2 et Echoes entre autres. Ceci dit l'album n'est pas mauvais. Ce sont de merveilleux musiciens
4,"Pathways - for spirit, mind, body","Having only recently emerged from the rock I was under during The California Guitar Trio's previous decades, I'm making up for lost time now and have yet to find a Trio album that disappoints me. The classical music relationship of this album (Pathways) satisfies on multiple levels---loosening the tension collected in neck and shoulders, unknotting the mind's tangles and knitting up that raveled sleeve of care as effectively as sleep. As the Trio travel the Pathways from piece to piece, they build anticipation and deliver satisfaction--both with recognized compositions and with those new to me. When played on CD-Rom, the enhanced CD's visuals rival, even surpass, those that the Trio paint in my head with this offering. I like it, I'm glad I purchased it, I want to share it with friends and family. It's a Keeper !"
4,MIX IT UP,"The Hamilton Beach Mixer is wonderful! I bought this mixer because my old one was outdated--looked like something from the 70's! The HB has a nice sleek appearance, along with extra blades to do the heavy-duty jobs like kneading bread dough or mixing heavier batters that the regular blades might have trouble with. It's even got enough power to keep ""Tim, the Tool Man, Taylor"" happy and it won't put a huge dent in your wallet. So if you're looking for something to ""MIX IT UP"" with, get the Hamilton Beach--it's the best!"
1,"neat storage, but useless mixer","bought this because I loved the idea that you could store all the accessories with the mixer- everything stores well except I could never get the cord in too and like the reviewer before me, mine is stored very nicely at the local dump! No matter what I did I could never get one of the beaters to stay in and while using it it would always fall out and into the batter. I though it just might be the way I was putting it in but it was always the same one falling out and I had numereous family members try it also with the same results- am now looking for a new one"
1,Disgusting and dangerous - Chrome plating flaked off the beaters into my cake,"Stay away from this product. It should be recalled. I was using this mixer for only the second time. I made a simple cake and while pouring it into the cake pan, I noticed dark little bits that turned out to be little metal colored flakes. I inspected the beater and saw that it was shedding chrome plating. You get what you pay for but I would think it would be cheaper to NOT plate the beaters and certainly cheaper not to face a recall."
1,Metal Flaked cookie dough,"I bought this mixer in July after reading the many positive reviews and the good price. I haven't used it that much as I'm not an avid baker, so I was surprised to little metal flakes from the beaters in the cookie dough that was being mixed. I haven't had any problems with the mixer itself, but what good is the mixer if the beaters are bad? Needless to say, I won't be using it again."
2,no low speed,"I bought this mixer because I loved the attachable case to hold all of the accessories and the price was right. It seemed to have a lot of power for mixing thick cookie dough. All of these qualities are wonderful and have proven their worth. But I forgot a very important issue until I actually used the mixer---the lowest speed is too high for the initial folding-together of ingredients. Flour and everything else is immediately airborne. Think about the initial speed of your Kitchenaid stand mixer--very slow, right? I find that the slow speed is just as important as the powerful, faster speeds. I suffered with this mixer for a couple of years until I just couldn't take it anymore, then went out and bought a Kitchenaid Professional 9. No accessory case but my dough stays in the bowl until I pour it."
3,No LOW speed,"Although others have commented on the lack of a true low speed, I still purchased this mixer. They were right; the low speed is really too fast.I like how the cord and beaters tuck inside the bottom case, but the speed problem is what has made me reuse my 35 year old Hamilton Beach hand mixer."
2,Low speed not low,"I really like the case it comes in, but the lowest speed is quite fast. The whips do not go in their slots easily either."
3,Low speed is too high,"It is a nice powerful mixer, but the lowest speed is just too high. I bought this for my wife for Christmas last year and I've heard grumblings about that low speed for a year! When you mix dry ingredients into flour mixture, while making cookies for example, it tends to fling liquid and flour out of the bowl. I've managed to slow it down only by using the free standing speed control for my router. That's all I could do and she's not too happy with the need for dual controls. So, while it's an OK mixer the speed control needs to be changed."
3,Hamilton Beach Hand Mixer,"This is a better product than older models. It isn't quite as light in weight as I would prefer but still better than most. And while I like its performance the only other feature that could stand improvement is that it doesn't beat as slowly on first speed as you might like. All in all, it is certainly acceptable as a handy mixer.C. Conti"
1,Will not last,I purchased the mixer about 6 mo's ago. Mixing cream cheese frosting today and the beaters started hitting each other. Bearings apparently shot. Very unhappy with the durability.
4,Good price - decent unit,"Haven't used it a lot, but it does the job for those small baking jobs. I wish all of these devices would switch to variable speeds rather than multiple discrete speeds - it would make things easier - I'm guessing rheostats are more expensive."
2,Slow speed is WAY TOO FAST!,"It works, and its designed well and seems sturdy but my biggest complaint is that the lowest speed is actually really super fast. If you want something to lightly mix things here and there this isn't for you."
4,Good mixer,"Like many of the other reviews, the low speed is definitely not so low. However, it's a pretty good mixer."
1,Would Not Recommend,"Yes, the snap-on storage is nice. But I don't like this mixer because: (1) It is so loud it hurts my ears; (2) it's heavy; (3) one beater tends to fall out; and (4) the slowest speeds are too fast. I'm donating this one and buying a different brand."
2,Hamilton Beach 62695R Power Deluxe Hand Mixer,I was looking for a smaller power mixer - the one that was delivered is too big and too much power i only use speed setting 1 i liked the things tht came with it.. i would want it cardless
2,Hamilton Beach Power Deluxe Hand Mixer,It works okay but I just spent almost 30 minutes whipping a quart of heavy whipping cream. The major problem I see is the noise level. It is unbearable. While I was whipping the cream I put my hand over the vent to soften the noise level but could only do it for awhile because the motor heated up then. I used to own a Hamilton Beach food processor but ended up throwing it away because of the noise.My advice is to look elsewhere as fast as you can.
1,Smoke and Mirrors,"This mixer seemed good - a handy dandy stand, ""power deluxe"", power and convenience rolled into one, right? Wrong. My mixer was sent to its final resting place, after expelling a large cloud of smoke, while trying to mix cookie dough. This mixer lasted only 1 year and did not live up to its name."
2,Beaters are rusty!,"I have had this mixer for about a year. I love the storage box but you have to line it up just right for it to snap on. It is quite powerful, the lowest setting will shoot flour everywhere if you aren't using a high sided bowl. It still works like new after a year of beating potatoes a couple times a month with it but I will be buying a new one soon. After soaking the beaters on several occasions and washing them in the dishwasher they are all rusty. If they sell replacement beaters cheap I would consider keeping it though I haven't checked to see if they do. I have only used the whisk once and was not impressed but I don't really whisk much so I didn't need it anyway."
5,Hand held mixer,"Been great so far. Had cracked snap on storage case when I received it (had been noted when I ordered it) but the case was replaced by Hamilton Beach with a better one at no cost to me, including shipping charges."
4,Hamilton Beach Hand Mixer,Very powerful although a little louder than my old mixer. Good feature is the snap on case that stores the cord and the beaters and keeps everything together when not in use. Works just fine.
4,Power Deluxe Hand Mixer - Fabulous and worth the money!!!,"This is a fabulous hand mixer, works better than a kitchenaide that you pay more money for and I love that the all the attachments fit in a snap on plastic case for easy storage.Great product and great buy!!!!!"
5,Mix it up with Hamilton Beach!,"This is a great product for the money. Easy to hold, powerful and I like the case for storage. Excellent for preparing boxed cake and cookie mixes, also mashed potatoes. That's the extent of my cooking!"
3,Was great...when I wasn't using it...,"This mixer stores very nicely...however, I only used it a handful of times, and it is now stored very nicely at the dump. ;) It completely burned out the last time I took it out to use it -- granted, I was trying to mix something moderately thick, but the motor should not have burned out like that (considering the small amount of use in its lifetime). Very disappointed - but I guess you get what you pay for."
2,"I liked it so much, shame that I had to return it...","I'm a casual baker, so this product was perfect for very light usage.Pros: Inexpensive, Good low speed, powerful enoughCons: The claim ""Stainless-steel beaters and whisk are dishwasher-safe"" is, at least to me, a false one. After a couple runs in a dish-washer, the wisks started to form some rust. So I ended up returning this item."
1,Burned out,Worked great for about 10 uses - then died mixing a box cake mix - not a heavy batter. My previous cheap mixer had lasted for 15 years...very disappointing.
4,quality mixer/good price,"My old Sunbeam worked fine but was outdated, heavy and lacked the power I now have with the Hamilton Beach. Like the optional beaters and storage. A lot of bang for the buck. Does the job for a non-gourmet cook. Highly recommended."
4,Powerful Little Mixer,"I recieved this mixer as a housewarming gift. It's very nice, with a convient case that stores the beaters and cord, then slips right onto the mixer. There is a lot of power in this mixer, and I'm not sure how well it would work for delicate mixtures as the first setting kicks as hard as the second. But for my needs it works extremely well. I just wish it came in black."
3,good but loud,"It's a good product, I've been using it for two months. It's powerful. I've never been above speed 2.But is way too loud, that's why I removed one star and it's very heavy (another star I removed)."
1,Piece of junk,"Exactly one year old and stopped working! No warning except a slight burning odor last time I used it, and it was only cake batter, nothing thick that would strain the motor. Next time I turned it on, nothing happens. My last hand mixer lasted 25 years and this one only one!"
4,Smart and Pretty mixer,"I wanted to bake a cake,so got this one so as to get myself a reason to bake. It performs well and came with a storage case. Got this for $19.99 on Amazon couple of years ago(2010). I had to buy a new one as I gave it to a friend of mine. Had hard time finding something cheaper ( I dont bake often, so dint wanted to spend much), was lucky to get one of the same style at Costco for $15 as couldnot find anything cheaper online."
1,Rusty Beaters,"Buy this mixer if you having to use a brillo to get your beaters clean every time they come out of the dishwasher. Hey Hamilton Beach, what kind of cheap Chinese metal did you make these out of? Every time I take the beaters out of my new Bosch Dishwasher, they're rusty. I've tried rinsing them in the sink first but they still come out with rust on them. The problem is with the cheap material HB uses to make the beatters. The mixer itself seems decent for the price but don't buy this if you don't want rust in your food."
3,Not great,Heavy feeling and beaters got rusty after less than a year so I had to toss it out. Beaters should not have rusted that fast. Don't buy it.
3,Great while it lasted .....,"Great while it lasted.....I have owned this model for about 9 months. Last night, while whipping cream, one of the beaters fell out. The latch must be broken because the beater will not re-insert and stay in. I usually have good luck with Hamilton Beach products, but with almost anything shipping out of Asia now, you can't really expect to get more than 12 good months of use. I will probably not replace with this model/manufacturer."
4,Good little hand mixer,Works well and has many variable speeds. Unlike my old mixer I did not need to turn this one all the way to high to get a good speed and strength. The case plastic does not feel as sturdy as my old mixer though so we'll see if this one lasts as long (10 years).
3,Works fine but a little loud,"It does what it is supposed to do but is louder than expected at the high speeds. At $20, I would probably buy again."
4,a great follow up album,"Lovedrug still has not hit the music scene big but with this release it shouldnt be long. the album begins with two quick fast paced songs in happy apple poioson and pushing the shine. the third track is my favorite, thieving is a beautiful song with great lyrics and captivating melody. This album wraps up with the harder rocking tracks at the end. salt of the earth is a deep song that has a rattling chain in the background, its all very interesting."
3,Took a Chance and Was Rewarded,"At first I didn't care for the lead singer Michael Shepard's voice. But the music is really good, and I like the very alternative sound. That made me listen to it again. On each listen I am aware that Michael doesn't have the strongest voice, but I found it matches the music and expresses the emotion of the lyrics teamed with the music. He does have passion and that shines through. This is one of those CDs that sneaks up on you. I actually like all the songs, although the last half of the record is my favorite. I like the mix of piano and keyboards with guitar. If you are feeling like listening to some alternative songs about love and life, this is a good cd to put in the CD player or your computer at work. Just turn the volume down a little, because the guitar can be on the hard side."
4,Great!,This item came very quickly. I have had no problems with it. Nothing was damaged and it still works. I am happy with this product!
4,An Amazing Discovery,I found this great new Christian band on Myspace.com and purchased their CD the day after its release. A very impressive debut that features strong Southern style rock with a 70's flair. These guys sing about their faith in Christ and make no excuses.Pick this CD up and I promise you will not be disappointed!
4,"SF3 is an awesome game, so is the music.","Though some of the tracks are short and pointless, it fulfills the ""soundtrack"" qualities of a game. Which include; those pointless tracks. However my personal favorties were the character selection, when I played the game, I always wished I could find the song for it, and now I do. Just as well, I love drum and bass... so Akuma, and Necro & Twelve's stages were a treat. For anyone who likes techno, or even just the game, GET IT."
4,Awesome soundtrack! Except......,"First of all, I want to say recommend this to all the Street Fighter fans out there. Most of the time, I play the game just to hear the music. Among my favorites are ""Third Strike""- the game's theme, ""Let's Get it On Now""-just before battle, and ""Movin' On""-staff roll. My only beef about this soundtrack is that the full version these three songs are not on it. Other than that, awesome soundtrack."
1,no way to search for an article.,this is a car without wheels. one cannot get to where one wants without scrolling ad infinitum or guessing as there is no index or search.
2,Not what I was looking for!,"I regret buying this DVD. Actually, it wasn't what I was looking for. There was another documentary called KINGS OF THE RING which focused on the careers of Jack Johnson, Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis and Muhammad Ali. It was directed by Bud Greenspan, I saw it once or twice on SHOWTIME and thought it was excellent. The tribute to Joe Louis was particularly touching. What we have here is an HBO produced documentary with a similar name but with less class. Admittedly, some of the footage here is rare (the Schmeling-Baer fight, Carnera boxing a kangaroo), but it just feels like footage spliced together with bleh commentary. And poor Larry Holmes. You get to watch him get pummelled by a young Mike Tyson again. No mention of his 7 years as heavyweight champion of the world. ...But save your [money] and wait for Showtime to air the Greenspan documentary."
3,Poor poor Larry,"I've seen Larry Holmes interviewed in the past and at first I thought he was just a man with a massive inferiority complex but now I understand his problem. When a film such as this (which gives a fairly detailed history of the heavyweight crown) completely and uterly ignores his domination of the division for a five to eight year span, I think his complex is justified. Max Baer and Primo Carnera get five times as much attention in this movie as does holmes.I was also expecting some kind of explanation of when and how the multiple governing bodies took precedence in the awarding of the title. After all it's something that could be discussed in narration alone without additional footage. Instead... we magically skip from Ali, who apparently has one title, to the days of Tyson and multiple titles. This is an important omition.I understand that there is not film coverage of the absolute beginning of the heavyweight crown but I also find fault with the omission of this info..."
2,"30 minutes of boxing, 60 of filler in this TKO (Total Krap-Ola)","What a disappointing 90 minutes this is! Brief highlights of two-dozen widely circulated fights are shuffled in with Lindbergh in Paris, babies crying in 'Nam, Malcolm X speechifying, dirigibles, Hitler, Mussolini, the '36 Olympics, FDR's voice over shots of waving grain, sheep walking along a dam, fans lining up for a fight, and just about any obscure 20th Century newsreel footage they could dredge up.We see Rocky Marciano box Jerry Lewis while a laughing Dean Martin referees, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby waltz in the ring with former pugilists as balloon-chested Barbara Eden looks on, Fiorello LaGuardia babbles, Sgt. Joe Louis blows his lines for a WWII PSA, Ali sings in a Broadway show, Joe Frazier haha's over beating ""God,"" Primo Carnera spars with a kangaroo, greasy Sonny Liston sweats, ancient Dempsey and Tunney pretend box for the camera, and so on. Feh.Totally ridiculous. Throw in the towel on this one."
1,Showtime is the better vision,Can someone please !!! Tell me were I can buy the showtime vision of this documentary... Someone somewhere must know we're you can buy the showtime vision !?
3,An Anthemic Album,"The Whiskey Rebels are our local heroes- they draw large audiences to local Sacto venues, and always provide a good time. Their album may not be revolutionary or particularly memorable, but it is at least worth the studio time to provide fans the ability to listen and memorize the songs so they can join in the sing along at the next show."
1,"Really , Really, Really BAD","This Band is by far the worst representation of Music everknown. Never have I nor anyone for that matter, have ever beenexposed to such garbage.The bassist is grossly inadequate andobviously should attempt another trade. Who are these guyskidding? I heard someone refer to them as ""local heros""...yeah,maybe to thier mama's. It is impossible to get across how badthis album is with any amount of written words."
4,Your Little Princess Will Love These,"I bought these slip-ons for my daughter when the weather started getting a bit cooler and socks alone were not keeping her feet warm enough. She loves her special shoes--especially the faces! Pediatricians recommend that babies not wear hard-soled shoes until they are walking, so these ""soft"" shoes are perfect. So far, my Little Lady only has this one pair, but with all of the neat styles (and sizes) available, I can practically guarantee that she'll have another pair or two.My only gripe with these shoes (hence the 4-star rating) is that the soles seem to get scuffed up relatively quickly. My daughter is not walking yet, but the bottom of the Robeez look like she has been!"
5,LOVE THESE SHOES!,"I just bought these for my 6 month old daughter. She's using her walker now and I wanted her to be able to use it without messing up all her socks. These are so soft on the inside and outside. They are easy to put on and what's great about them is that they actually stay on! I bought these princess one's for her first (I wanted to see how much I liked them before I bought another pair). I definitly will buy another pair in a different color so she can wear them with all her little outfits. If you want a pair of ""first shoes"" for your baby these are the way to go. I wish I knew about them when my other kids were little."
3,OUCH! is accurately titled.,"The fourth release from this great prog-pop band hits a wake in the Lake. Gone are keyboardists Geoff Peacey and Detlef Petersen, who wrote nearly all the music (with James Hopkins-Harrison's lyrics) for the first three great albums, and their void is reflected here. While Ouch! is certainly not bad, in fact a few of the tunes such as Celebrate are actually pretty good, what's missing are the memorable hooks, nuances and counterpoints of Mssrs. Peacey and Petersen, not to mention their absolutely amazing keys and synth work. Guitarist Alex Conti also left during production of this album, and it all went downhill from there. The last gasp of the remnants of the premiere late seventies line-up of this outstanding band. Get it if you must, but don't bother with anything after this."
4,Shake your brains,"Self Construct by Defragmentation is a harsh visit into the world of jungle, noise, experimental, and industrial. It sounds like a combination of Download and Atari Teenage Riot.The drum beats are relentless and intricate, and the samples emerge in explosions. Brief moments of melody are ... by brutal bursts of noise and burbles of digital effects.This is what industrial is supposed to be all about, isn't it?If you expect to hear four on the floor rhythms, you'll be sorely disappointed. However, if you want something to shake your brains up, Defragmentation will do the trick quite unnicely."
3,okay if the software works,"I bought this for a company video recently. The good part is it's light, touch screen, easy to use, video are clips viewable on PC with the codec installed, no need to capture it. The Bad things are: It's a bit too small to fit my hand. I was using a tripod so it wasn't terribly bad. The software to make the DVD doesn't seem to work, everything went thru, started processing and said there's a file being used, rebooted, reinstall, update to the latest version still doesn't solve it."
5,It's unfair to downrate when the specs are published,"Yes, the new generation of Sony HDD camcorders do not support Firewire; instead they only have USB 2.0 ports. But that information is published in the camera's specs, so buyers should be well aware of what they're getting (and what they're not). It's hardly fair to buy the camera and then give it only one star because you didn't do your homework."
3,The Good and the Bad,"The Good:Nice picture quality (for what it is)Smooth ZoomLightweight and very portableThe Bad:Broken out of the box (the mode switch didn't work). Had to have it fixed right away (it was covered through warranty)Menus a little complex if you're trying to look at something quicklyIn playback, the bottom of my screen has a black ""border"" that bounces up and down. I hate it but I'm not paying to get it fixed because I'm tired of messing with it.As I type this, the battery is totally dead and unchargable. I need to buy a new battery.The software that comes with it is not user friendly AT ALL. I've had nothing but problems getting the footage on to my computer."
3,Proprietary batteries :(,"Just a note: Sony is now using proprietary batteries in this and other models. I bought an aftermarket backup battery, and the camera displayed ""USE SONY INFO LITHIUM'. Sony batteries are twice the price of aftermarket, and I'm told they are only available through sony. Still photos are dissappointing-I'll check the manual to see if still resolution is adjustable, but I don't think it is.EDIT:9/07-I have sold this CC due to the bad video and worse still quality (less than .5 MP actual resolution). It looks like it will be a while before HDD catches up to HDV tape units in quality and software. Arter watching DVDs from this POS on my 37"" LCD, I'd give it 0 stars if I could."
4,Tiny Wonder,"I've been using the Sony Handycam for work and so far it's been working out pretty well. I'm not a manual reader and like things to work right out of the box. With a working knowledge of these new gadgets today, it was relatively easy to get it started. I'm able to export directly to my computer or create a dvd with only one touch of a button (although I haven't done this yet). I like it, it's easy to use, light weight and has a 30 gb hard drive so it never runs out of space.The only drawback is that I'm often trying to figure out where the connectors are on the camera. I'm figuring it out though."
1,Don't waste your $$$,This was a gift from my husband to record and photograph our trip to Disney. I am horrified at the video and especially the picture quality. I cannot believe this thing is on the market. Shame on Sony.
4,Works with my Mac,"For what it's worth, the DCR-SR40 works with my MacBook Pro. After connecting the camera with USB 2, it shows up as a mass storage device with mpeg2 files. There's a nice shareware app called ffmpegX that can import into a number of formats, including regular dv with audio. Quicktime can't play mpeg2 by default, but you can buy the codec from Apple (http://www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2/). It seems to have a problem with muxed, audio, though, so it isn't really a complete solution."
4,Great little Camera - with two small things I have issues with,I bought this for my wife who teaches music and occasionally needs a camcorder to record the musical events. I filmed in low light from the back of the room with only spotlights on the cast of the musical and both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the output. However; several things I did not notice prior to purchase which are not show stoppers but would have influenced my decision about this camera: No USB connection on the camera. You have to put it into the docking station for the USB transfer of files to your computer. And the only other thing is that if you are running the camera off the power cord plugged into the wall - it will not charge the battery. You can switch the camera off and the battery will start charging - this again is not a show stopper but somewhat of a hassle for me.I really like the camera but these two small things distract me from an excellent rating.
2,Beware of scene transitions with this camera,"There is one imporant detail with this camera, every time that there is a scene transition the image freezes for about half a second, as when your are watching a satellite image and the broadcasat gets momentarily interrupted.This will not be shown if you replay on the camera, but it will after you transfer your video to your PC or burn a DVD.This is mentioned in the manual as normal, I even contacted Sony customer support, and they told me the same thing.I believe you will not like it.I returned mine, as I was dissapointed."
5,Don't miss this band!,"I will never understand the music industry...why on EARTH hasn't this band gotten the mainstream critical acclaim they so richly deserve? The same industry zipperheads that bring us one lamentably pneumatic, barely-pubescent zero after another have yet to wake up and find Opie Gone Bad, a truly hot band that actually has something intelligent to say along with the real-life experiences to back it up. As others have pointed out, if you're east of the Mississippi, you may never have heard of Opie before, but don't let that deter you. This uber-talented group of four can kick it with the best of them, producing irresistibly funky, provocative, sly tunes that are guaranteed to leave you wanting more. Buy anything they've done--you won't regret it."
5,Just Great!,I have had this blender for about a week and use it mainly forblending flaxseed oil and cottage cheese with fruit on a dailybasis. Also made breadcrumbs tonight in a few minutes. It islight and easy to handle. Just be warned that the container isPLASTIC and YOU CAN'T PUT IT IN THE DISHWASHER...but I find itpretty painless to soak it in soapy water. It dries quickly.I like it very much and it works beautifully.
3,sounds like unsane,"Thats right. This sounds just like Unsane. Both bands share the same singer so I guess they're going to sound similar, although unless youre a huge fan you probably couldn't tell the difference. I can dig the vocal distortion thing, but come on! This vocal style can get annoying very quickly. Sure its heavy, and you can tap your feet to it, but it gets old quick. You'd think they wouldn't want to sound just like Unsane."
1,Family Game Night Nightmare!,"I bought this game for my 12 year old, who loves to travel. We spent a very frustrating half hour trying to understand the complicated and convoluted action of this game and then just gave up. Notice that the five star review that accompanies this product is a review of Amazon service, not the product.Do not waste your family time or money!"
5,Lots of fun!,"My 14 year old son and I have been playing this game for over a year now. Sometimes my wife plays, and a couple of times my mother in law has played too. It's a fun game, but you need to know something about the States, a little bit of ""Pop Culture"" over the years, and things you'd see along the road. After playing awhile it is a very easy game to pick up on and a quick glance back at the rules will refresh your memory about how some of the different questions work. It's a lot of fun and I would recomend the game. (it's pretty educational too)"
5,Helpful Information So Far....,"Of the information I have read in this book, it should be useful for writing a visual arts grant. Some of the information was not pertinent since I am not graduating from a college. However, as a working artist, I can use the information that I need that I was not familiar with along business lines in the arts."
1,simplistic,"I love quirky mysteries, so I really looked forward to this book. It was horrible--one of the dumbest books I've seen in years. The writing was simplistic, immature, sexist, and boring. I can't imagine a grown adult feeling interested in this grade-school level junk. The remarks of the characters were so sexist, I was sure I'd picked up an old book by mistake--I sure was surprised to see it was published in 2004, not 1940! Yes, I am over the age of 13, but there's no way anyone over the age of 13 would like this book, it's written at a 6th-grade level."
3,On the Attack,"Acker is well known for her curious brand of W.S. Burroughsian hypertextual fiction. However, in this essay collection, Acker experiments with the realm of non-fiction and pushes the essay to its limits. Her writing here is just as political, transgressive, and outrageous as it is in her novels. Acker takes on a wide breadth of subject matter including the importance of Peter Greenaway's films and the ideological underpinnings of fairytales. What makes Acker a cut above the rest of the postmoderns known for shock is the same thing that made Burroughs so great, a razor sharp intellect. A must for Acker-ites and a good place to start for those who want a glimpse into the interests that inform Acker's fiction. Bodies of Work is also a useful and concise essay collection for anyone interested in art, politics, and culture in the postmodern frame."
2,So-So,"This is not my first processor nor will it be my last, in fact I am writing this review while looking for a better machine. It works and if it is your first processor it is prbably fine. It is unfortunately underpowered for real work and I just burned mine out making a few cups of hummus. This is an adequate beginner machine but strains a lot."
4,It's all right.,"Karl French has written a decent book about ABBA. He does analysize the tracks on each of ABBA's albums and has an overview of the plot to Mama Mia. However, this book has very little new information about ABBA. In fact, on his source page, he cites more than 20 websites. If you want a definite ABBA book, I would recommend Bright Lights, Dark Shadows."
3,Archos is alright but software add-ons sneak up on you,"I've been very happy with the function of my Archos 605. My only complaint is that there are extra charges for the software needed to get on the internet and for viewing most movies.In bright sunlight it may be a little hard to see the screen and unless you are in a quiet place, forget the one external speaker and stick to the ear buds.This is perfect for the airports and airplanes I spend a lot of time in.With the basic unit, it can only be charged from USB. I just got a 12V USB car plug and can charge it in a rental car or use a 120VAC to 12VDC adaptor in hotel rooms.Keep in mind, with the 80 gigs of space, plenty can be placed on the hard drive."
4,Excellent for the most part,"Pros:-Picture Quality-All the add ons-Price to storage ratio-Stand (Believe me, this is great when using video)Cons:-Battery Life (not quite close to what is advertised; I have gotten 5 hours of mixed usage: Video and Audio when I should be getting 5 hours of Video)-Weight-The included Cover-Proprietary Cable (no mini-USB)I think this is a fairly honest review, and do feel that despite the magnificent player this is (I have the 80gb one), the cons make me give this 4 stars. I think that if the cons are covered, this player (which I already think sets the benchmark for PMPs) would be as close to perfect as possible. One warning, as you might have discovered, this is a modular design in that the price you see is not the price you should expect for every one of those functionalities to work (the TV station, Codecs for movies, certain MP3s, and wifi Internet will cost *extra*)."
3,OK for MP3 & Flash Video,"The player is a good MP3 & FLV file player, but the web browser stinks. What a waste of money the Opera Browser work in Windows with out crashing but on the Archos 605 it is slow. It has crashed many times in the middle of a web page, reseting the Archos back to a cold boot. It won't play many videos from HULU or YouTube or many other web sites they are using the latest version of flash on supported in the 605.Every thing codex, apps are extra money and while the icon is on the screen it sends you to a Buy Now Screen then to a web site for the Archos Store that states Coming Soon what crap is this.Not thrilled as I was when it arrived, if all the addins are as bad as the Oprera Web Browser then spend your money on something else.Bill"
2,You can do much better.,"The video playback is good. The music player could be a lot more streamlined. Too many clicks to switch from shuffle to normal play, etc.The WI-FI is probably not worth the extra money. The browser isn't capable of much, and the touchscreen keyboard is a pain.Support from the manufacturer is pretty weak. I need to replace the screen. Pricing starts at $162.50. That's more than this mediocre player costs. The customer service guy acted like I was wasting his valuable time as he asked for my information.I would not recommend this unless you get it for a really, really low price. Not worth the trouble."
3,"battery, battery, battery","I have been using archos since gmini 220. Great product, but just thebattery sucks. Turns out 3 years later, those French people neverlearn, for mobile unit, battery IS important! Why would they givesuch a great product such a low capacity battery? Mine lasts only 2~2.5hours watching movie.Other than the battery it is a great unit, occasinally would freeze upwhich requires a hardware reset, but not a serious threat since youdon't lose any files."
1,AWFUL!!!!,"I wish I had taken heed of the negative reviews...but being stubborn and stupid might I add, I ignored them all the went ahead and poured my money down the drain buying this piece of electronic junk! It is the MOST temperamental gadget I have EVER had the misfortune of owning or using! It freezes for no apparent reason other than a freeze is overdue since the last one about 15 mins ago!! I have at least heeded the advice about Archos's call center and I have not bothered to call or send it back. Life is too short. A lesson has been learnt though. I will NEVER purchase another Archos piece of junk again. A word of advice to anyone still foolish enough to ignore the negative feedback...make sure you carry a paper clip with you everywhere as part of the accessory kit...you will need it for all the constant resets!!!!"
1,No playlist management,"So like they say, the screen looks great, audio quality is fine, Wi-Fi browser works relatively smoothly.Here's where the product dies: you can't manage playlists from any PC music player. It won't work like an iPod or Zune where you can create playlists in iTunes or Windows Media player and then transfer them over. You actually have to find every track you want in the playlist in ""My Computer"" and drag and drop it over.This may not be a problem for most listeners, but at least for me, I have an extensive (70gb) music library and I manage all my music in WMP playlists. Not having this functionality really destroyed the player for me and I'm planning on buying a different MP3 player now.Sorry, Archos."
1,broken with little use,"My Archos 605 80GB after a year and a half of nearly no use died sitting on the shelf. Its body is swollen and bursting at the seams. It is probably a faulty battery judging from Archos forums. What a piece of ****.Aside from that, when I first bought the unit I paid for 2 plug-in. The browser was useless and there was no response from their customer service. I will never buy another Archos product again."
4,"Great video player, somewhat difficult to use as in-car mp3 player","This product is great as a portable video and music player, but can be difficult to use in your car as an mp3 player. The buttons are pretty easy to use, but can be a little difficult to use when driving. It would help out a lot of the phono plug was on the right side instead of the left for in-car use as it can be a little difficult to maneuver or place it anywhere. I would still buy it, hands down, over the other 160GB mp3 player that is out there. My only other gripes are that after a song starts playing, it takes about 10 seconds before you can look at the info of the song or skip to the next, and that you have to buy extra accessories just to use some of the features that I think should be included (eg. WiFi) especially since it is part of the name of the player."
2,slow wifi also requires extra spending on softwares,"It seemed to be a good gadget but wifi speed seemed to be slow compared to my laptop's wifi connectivity. Also It does not come with any browser which lets you go online, until you buy one from mfg. You can use as an mp3 player if you don't want to spend any extra money. Also can be used as a picture viewer. Also there was constant humming sound in ear phones when wifi connectivity was on."
1,Regret buying,"The 605 looked nice the few minets it work, the first thing I did when I got it was to install the firmware update, after that it no longer worked. I've returned it to amazon just waiting now for my refund. Took seconds to buy but I probably won't see my money back for weeks. From all the reviews Archos is not a good product and if you have to deal with Archos customer support it seems your really going to regret buying one."
2,two big problems,"1) Battery life is awful. Can barely watch one movie before it dies.2) Volume is awful. Turned all the way up, volume is much less than satisfactory. I called Archos and the representative acknowledged it as a problem. He stated that it was intentionally done to ""save our customers ears."""
2,"Great Product, awful service","The Archos 605 is a great product, with a clean, crisp 4.3 inch screen. However, after owning one myself, i returned it due to its compatibility issues, and the web browser. I advise against getting this product if you own a Mac, because the steps necessary to get the Archos up and running are extremely time consuming and pricey. Also, the web browser is extremely sluggish compared to Safari on the Ipod Touch. If you can deal with both of those issues, then you reach the customer service problems. To be able to call customer service, you have to set up an account for your Archos, which is a pain if you a Mac, because you cannot set up an account on Safari, it does not work. Customer service is the worst that you will ever deal with. I sat waiting for the operators to pick up the phone for over half an hour, and this happened multiple times. if you have the choice between the Archos and the Ipod Touch, go with the Touch. It is much more reliable, and easier to work with."
1,Craptastic!,"Yeah, this thing looks decent enough, and it's convenient too, but I found the user interface to be sorely lacking. It was insane how difficult it was to simply add my MP3s to the Archos.Add to this the fact that the Ok button on mine stopped working after less than two weeks, and the fact that I had some fairly bad pixel dimming in less than a month, and you have yourself a craptastic piece of electronics.It's not like I'm rough on my gadgets either. Heck, I've got a 5G iPod that's still in pristine condition, even though those things were known to scratch up like mad before they switched to the aluminum case."
2,As I wait on hold....,"I loved my ARCHOS for 6 months. It worked great. The web browser wasn't lightening fast but good enough. The image is great, the sound is good. Easy to use. Movies can be purchased online using the wifi, which is handy. Now the unit is totally dead. I kept up with their updates and treated it very gently as I loved it.I turned it on one day and it would not moved beyond the welcome screen. I sent it in to be repaired, which is covered under warranty if it dies within the first year, I had to pay for shipping. Now I am forever on hold to fix an address confusion."
4,Archos 605 wifi,"Decent set of features. Recording television works well with the portable DVR. The portable DVR worked better, for me, than did the Archos TV+. With the TV+, I could not record any of the HD channels, but could, although not in HD quality, with the portable DVR. Nice sound quality from the mp3 player. Nice video player. Nice screen clarity.Web browser (Opera) crashed too often. I would not consider this a fully functioning web browser (e.g., cannot compose email). Cannot open many different file types (e.g., Word documents)."
3,Trouble Trouble Trouble,"Tech support keeps you on hold forever (44 minutes the last time for me)and really is not helpful when they finally do answer the phone. And support would be a good thing considering all the problems with the software. My music tracks cut out after one minute and nineteen seconds, only if you access them from the music tab. If you go through the file tab they work fine. I had to figure that solution myself since tech support had no clue. It scrambled the taqs in my Windows Media library during sync. I copied the files back from the player after deleting all the scrambled files again devising my own solution while I was on hold. Tech support had no suggestions. Point is, the software needs work. And they need to hire somebody who has a brain for tech support."
2,Interesting Device with Fatal Flaw,"Many of the Archos' features I loved. However, I was only able to get 2 hours of audio from a fully charged battery. I know this may not be typical, but it was a show stopper for me."
3,"If you love static, get one!","This is my second unit in a year and Archos has obviously not solved the static problem. I waited 9 months to get the second one, thinking they would have the bugs worked out. That was a mistake! The problem occurs when streaming media over wifi while using headphones. It's totally unbearable. I sent this second unit in for repair and after 3+ weeks, have the same problem. If you don't intend on using the wifi feature to stream your videos/music while using headphones then by all means go for it!"
1,RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN THE OTHER WAY,"Archos 605 Wi-Fi Portable Media Player (160 GB)If you want to throw money away then by all means by a product from Archos. I gave it a few weeks and I had nothing but trouble with it. Either it didn't charge, locked up, wouldn't sync, you name it. All calls to their support were pretty useless with the vague answer of ""reset"" the unit.If I could rate this with negative stars - I would. It's not worth the one star they make you select. The only GOOD thing about the product - Amazon refunded my money.I switched to a Zen Vision W - 60G - it's AWESOME and their support is great and helpful.Seriously, I will NEVER buy or recommend Archos to anyone."
1,Dont' buy it. It is a piece of Junk,"I have wasted my money buy this piece of junk. I have it repaired within 6 months. Battery won't charged. Hard Drive Frozen, erratic screen dispay, poor FLV support, etc. i am extremely disappointed and dissatisfied with this product and the company as a whole. Don't buy it. You will be sorry it you do."
1,Misleading,We bought this product so we could download items from Dish or Tivo and it can do neither
3,Web Browser - its Not Fair,"I paid so much money and bought it, but they fail to provide a web browser free. I bet business ethics they learn only when they fail dodge a bullet from a technology wave ( by some unknown company ).Anyway i could use it to listen music and watch video. I am not going to buy the browser and all the plugins."
2,Not a Steller Music Player,"My primary reason for purchasing this unit was for the large amounts of memory and the good reviews. Once I received it I found how buggy it's operating system is and how user-friendly it is NOT. I spent at least 20 hours working on it trying to copy music playlists from my computer to the Archos 605. I tried numerous methods and software applications and could never get it to work. My daughter showed me her ipod touch and I discovered how much easier tasks are on it. My daughter and I have had a friendly debate on who got the best product - I had to concede that for what we wanted to use it for, she did.Also, Amazon willingly took the product back, but it has taken them over two weeks to refund my money to my credit card."
1,came broken!!,"Got this item shipped just in time for xmas and when my son opened it it was broken, then the guy wanted ME to contact the manufactor cause he had no more in stock..no thanks!! And i still havent seen a credit to my credit card thank god i used amex..they took it off for investigation i had to beg for a shipping label to send it back to..what shouldi have paid for that too?? I rate this sales guy ooooooo"
1,Not worth the effort,"Have two Archos AV380s. Thought the 605 WiFi would be the ultimate replacement. Wrong! If it all worked, it might be the ultimate replacement. The WiFi will find the signal only rarely then will break when least expected. The widgets, opera network, and Archos portals are less than good. One needs to carry a straightened paperclip to reset the unit. Wait for Archos portals to come online and a unit that will find and hold the WiFi signal. I don't like to give one stars but this one is deserved in that the concept captured me but the concept is all that is there. The unit doesn't perform as expected."
2,Buy Something Else,"I bought the Archos 605 mainly for the hard drive capacity. I didn't want to be locked into the iTunes format and it seemed like the Archos was a good choice.My complaints are the following:They make a lot of claims about what it can do, then they nickel and dime you for those features. It's like 30 bucks if you want to get on the internet, and more if you want to play other types of video format. Before you know it you are paying more than you anticipated.The battery life is very short.It freezes up on me when I try to play certain audio files (I don't know why).The website is not user friendly.User interface on the device is not as smooth as the iTouch or iPhone.Finally there are not many manufacturers building accessories for it. For the iPod you can buy various protective cases and speakers that you can plug it into. There is like nothing for the Archos.It is not worth the money. Buy something else like an iPod."
4,Better than an iPod!,"You can't beat this Archos 605, 80gb wifi product - it's the best and better than the iPods (or other similar products) that holds movies. It's compact, easy to convert and load movies, and best of all, the resolution is crystal clear. However, I did not give it a five only because there were many additional downloads required to make it operate even better. Preference would have been for company to charge more for the actual Archos player and just include all these needed programs. Hated the extra time and effort in downloading these additional apps. Regarding the case, make sure to get one BUT don't bother with the ones made by Archos - too flimsy. Just go directly for one made by Noreve. Worth every penny. Trust me, I am a big case person and will search high and low to find the perfect one."
2,Great viewing screen but a pain having to purchase all the widgets to get everything to function.,Great viewing but there seems to be a problem with battery life while watching movies. I purchased two of them that had that same problem. Having to purchase all the widgets for the device is a bit of a pain and costly! I compared archos versus zune and zune was cheaper and easier to get movies downloaded to the device. The battery life on zune held up to its specs....
4,"Good, but with drawbacks","Overall, it's a pretty good buy. With that being said, one thing to take into consideration is the extra money you will need to spend to get it to the optimal working status. Consider how much you want it to do, because out-of-the-box condition is very basic (really only plays music, videos, and stores files). Once you add on the web browser ($30 U.S.) and others (generally around $20) it could cost a pretty penny, but will work exactly how you want it to. In my experience, customer service wasn't all that bad. I bought mine on Amazon, a button on the side broke a couple months later and it wouldn't turn on. I called in, they gave me the shipping information and I sent it to their repair place. No word for about 2 1/2 weeks and then one day it shows up at my doorstep as good as new, and no charge or fee."
4,Great little toy,"Easy to use, can fit LOTS of videos and MP3s, and portable. I take it to the gym to watch movies on the elliptical or exercise bike, use it on airplanes, listen to music while I'm taking a walk, etc.There are 3 cons, however, which is why I give it 4 stars as opposed to 4:1) The fact that it's a custom USB cord instead of a standard one. I'm scatterbrained and I misplace it a lot when I charge it on my laptop. While I have tons of regular USB cords lying around, it would cost me $20 to get a back-up of this custom one. Annoying!2) The volume control doesn't get as loud as I'd like.3) Battery life is somewhat short.That said, I'd recommend this product. It's fun having portable video access, and it makes working out at the gym go by A LOT faster :-)"
1,poor service by Amazon UK and Archos,"I bought this as a gift on 19 June and was given on 8 JUly.Within 2 weeks the device developed a fault, using the web help service did not cure the problem despite 3 attempts.Finally the device failed totally and is not of merchantable quality. Both Amazon and the' third party vendor declined to accept any responsibility for it.So we contacted Archos, who after much correspondence issued an RMA. The device was sent immediately, but it took a week to arrive in France. It has been sitting on a shelf for daysThe whole procedure clumsy and ineffecient.I have e-mailed the CEO bringing this to his attention but no reply after some days."
1,Don't waste your money,"My first mistake was when I got this from Sharper Image when it was still in business, the device, promptly broke within a few days of purchasing, so I exchanged it for another one. That was my second mistake, I should've just gotten my money back. The battery stopped charging within a year so I got it repaired by Archos under warranty. They took forever to send it back and NEVER responded to my emails. So their customer service sucked too. Now that the device is out of warranty the HD appeared to have failed. I've read that to replace the HD by Archos costs $200!! They don't make it easy for you to replace yourself because you need their OS installed. I was extremely gentle with so the device failure was not due to undue wear."
1,Don't Buy it.,"I owned my Archos 605 WIFI for 5 weeks when some of the functions stopped working while using it. When I attempted to re-boot the system, it would not restart. After some quick research, I found that this is a very common problem with these units. They don't last long. Because I bought it from Amazon and not directly from Archos, Archos doesn't want it back. This was a very expensive toy for little more than one month of use."
4,Archos 605,I love the product. A couple of minor points.1 the owners manual is a PDF file on the Archos it is not easy to get what you need off of itI wish it had a removable batteryEverything else is great great picture the content portal worked great I down loaded a movie and it was a great picture
2,This thing was a sad waste of money,"The main complaint is battery life. I have never been able to get the battery to hold a charge for more than 1 hour and after owning this for a year, it would look like it was charged, then lose charge immediately after taking it out of the docking station. I paid Archos $80 to fix the battery but when they returned it, it still had the same problem. Now I discovered about a week ago that the battery that they ""fixed"" exploded. They are starting me on a new return authorization process where they'll likely make me pay again because I'm sure it's out of warranty.Sad sad sad."
1,Customer Service/ Company Policy,"I bought the Archos 605 wi-fi for my daughter April 2009, and she has not been able to use the product. I was never able to connect to Windows Vista. I called customer Service and even though we reset the entire product, we were never able to connect. I was given a song and dance some free add-ons, but was unable to connect with Vista. I ultimatly got busy at work and let it sit. My daughter of course asked for the archos and I explained I could not get it to work.I called archos again and finally they sent an RMA, I should have just returned the product. It may be a great product, but I can not tell you that yet as archos has had the product for the past three weeks. They have determined that it was defective and it was getting a new motherboard. If you decide to buy an archos and it does not work, return it asap"
2,Poor battery ruins it!,"This product sounds great and if it worked as it was supposed to, it would be great. However, the battery only lasts about 6 hours of music play and just over 2 hours of video play, just enough to watch one movie. In addition, the system seems to crash quite often needing a system reset. I returned the first one I purchased as the company told me I had a defective product, but the second one did the exact same thing with the same poor battery performance.I asked the company to provide me with a free battery docking station to make up for the poor performance and after a long runaround; I was flatly turned down. I then asked for the $70 I had spent on the plug-ins returned and they refused; I had to dispute the charges through my credit card company.I would highly recommend you not purchase this product until they at least fix the battery problem, but don't take the companies word for it!"
1,Save you $,Total piece of crap. Returned it after a week of use. Better products out there. Crappy support from Archos.
5,Great product!!!!!!,"The Archos 605 is probably the best Media Player I have ever bought. Its not so much of a brick (consider that my hands are kinda small) and its more than enough capacity for me. After trying to find another option in the market I decided to go with this product because of its functionality. The battery life is a little less than expected, but I have used it for music for 12 hours straight and I havent had any problems.The service on Amazon.com was also great. The delivery was right on time the packages were sealed and I was able to monitor my purchase all the time. It was just a breeze to buy it here.... I totally recomend this product....."
4,Been very happy with the 605,"This is a great media device, the video quality is excellent and the audio seems to be better than other devices I own. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is there is an issue with syncronization in that if I sync a playlist in a program like media player or media monkey, it does bring in the music files and playlists, but the playlist structure doesn't match where the files are. So when I do select the playlist it doesn't see any songs. There are workarounds for this but would be nice if Archos would address this in future firmware releases for those of us who have had playlists set up long ago and don't wish to re-invent the wheel. But if you don't mind the work arounds I would highly recommend the 605."
4,ARCHOS 605 - 30 GB model,"Bought this product with the dock. By and large, both work as advertised. Read the product description at to what it does - I'll go over the cons.Biggest problem is this company has absolutely no support. Go to their website and there's no tel# and/or email address.Big problem - I recorded dvd movies to the device. It'll let you play on the device but not on an external device (e.g. TV).The user-interface is absolutely w/o ""out of the box"" thinking. very cumbersome and at times very unintuitive (e.g. copying files)There's some video editing features - sometimes buggy but works.Sometimes the mp3 file tags don't transfer over properly. This could be a WMP problem.Also, bought the browser. works but i wish it played WMP video streams.The company really needs to provide some sort of a support mechanism - at least a forum.Happy with the product..but sometimes not so."
4,Archos 605 wi-fi 30gb,my wife loves this thing. She records her tv shows and watches them at lunch at work. wi-fi is kinda sketchy at times and you have to pay extra for web browser
3,GOOD PRODUCT,"This is a real good PVP player except for the battery life. The video quality is great and the Wifi features makes it all worth it for the price. The only bad thing is that you have to pay extra for plug-ins that should have already been included. Also, battery life is not very good. Watching 1 movie might be enough to drain your battery life completely. (DVR STATION IS A MUST HAVE - to access the product,s full capability)"
2,Very disappointed,"Very disappointed in the product. When it's working correctly it's not too shabby but it has its share of problems. I could not get the Wifi to work correctly with my wireless router. After about 10 minutes of watching a video, the sound got very distorted. I would have to fast forward or rewind it slightly to get the sound back in working order. There's a new firmware version that can be downloaded that might fix the problem though? The unit locked up on me and gave me options to try to fix it, reformat it, or cancel the options. At this point, I'm very frustrated with the Archos 605. I will however try the newer firmware version to see if it helps."
2,605 Wifi whybuy?,"The Archos 605 Wi-fi is not a bad unit but the company sucks!! The unit has no place to put the stylus, you have to pay immediately for another 3 items to make it function. It does not have access to the web until you buy Opera, then it won't play VOB files for movies until you buy the cinema software. You cannot charge it quicker than many hours through a USB, it comes without any wall charger, you have to order a unit for $29.99 to speed up charging. The battery life is quite a bit less than claimed. Finally if you happen to live outside a big city anywhere in US or Canada and have a PO Box as your billing address they will not ship to you, you cannot pay with a VISA in that case, even if you purchased the item with the same VISA. Attempting to discuss these issues with the company is simply frustrating, the minions do not seem interested in your comments."
2,NOT worth it...,"for the price I paid, this device wasn't worth it. really...i havent even tested the archos 5, and i'm pretty sure its more worth it. I would much rather buy a cheap netbook than buy another PMP or IMT. but really, if you absolutely need a PMP, I would recommend not getting this little guy. get the archos 5 or an ipod touch...they area bit picier, but much, much better. but really, if you ask me, don't even get a PMP. a cheap netbook has the same amount of hard drive space with actual RAM and a user interface like windows or linux, not to mention the speedy internet browsing."
2,Does not work properly with Motorola cable boxes,I have two of the 605 30gb and the dvr recorder. They work great except if you wish to use the dvr recorder in combination with a motorola cable box - then the dvr does not work as described. This is a known problem discussed on other sites.
3,BULKY,"I bought this from amazon because i wanted to use the wifi capability and be able to use it to put all of my music and video on. When i got it in the mail and opened it up i thought it was pretty cool. However, it was much larger and heavier than i thought. I debated for about a week if i should keep it or return it for the new ipod touch. the touch only has 16 gigs but it is much more user friendly, sleeker, and is much easier to carry around with you. So thats what i did, i'm satisfied with my choice, the archos 605 works great but is just too bulky for my taste. It does everything i wanted and has a huge screen ++++. I recommend it to anyone that doesnt care about the size. Also, it is a good deal for an 80 gig player!"
1,Archos 605,"Terrible Christmas gift. I wish we would have gotten the I Touch instead first. We struggled with this device for over a week trying to buy the software to go on line with it, but it never worked. No one ever answered the phone in 10 days of trying and being on hold for hours."
5,Awesome PMP,"After testing the Archos 605 wifi for a few weeks, I can say that it was a great purchase. The large screen is excellent for viewing photos, videos, and perfect for surfing the web. With the internet plugin I was able to connect to my home wifi network and also surf the web in the airport.The speaker on the Archos is one of my favorite features. The touchscreen works great, but accuracy is key. Use the included stylus to press the small keys.Battery life is average, but charging is fast with the optional mini dock/ DVR dock/ or external battery dock.Overall, this does everything the ipod touch can do and exceeds those standards set by apple.What a great product!"
2,Get a cheap laptop/PC,"All you pay for is the size. I don't know what you could use this for without paying extra for the accessories and add on's?I paid extra for the web browser and cinema package so I could browse the net and watch videos. I also purchased the power dock (so I can charge it up via the power socket and not to hook it up to my PC). With all these additional extras just to get the thing to work adds to the price.Charging time is very slow, sound quality is poor. I calculated what I spent on this and it was near enough the same price as a cheap laptop.Archos need to improve on this device and include the additional extras as standard to make this any good. Nice try no medal!"
4,Great hardware at a great price,"I owned a 604 for a couple years. It crapped out once and I had a horrible experience with customer where I RMAd my system and they sent it back to me without fixing it. Eventually it got sorted out though.I went back to Archos when my system died for the second time. The 604 was discontinued so I bought a 605. I love it.The thing is there isn't anything in these reviews I don't agree with - both the positive and negative reviews. It's pretty crappy that they charge for the plug ins. And sometimes, they break and customer service is terrible.But for the price, esp today (the 30GB is a STEAL at it's current price...I am considering picking another one up just 'cause).All said, if you like to watch movies and want to be able to check the internet (it's not really designed for that so the ability is just bonus) then this is a great device."
3,Great PMP player minus charger,"The Archos 605 is a great movie player when it comes to color and navigation. However, it needs an ability to bookmark a movie so that you can easily navigate back to where you left off after powering off. I had to buy a separate wall charger as well. The Archos 605 comes with a USB adapter that acts as a dual charger or interface. The problem is that charging the Archos by USB is very inefficient compared to a wall socket. Once I bought a 3rd party wall socket charger the Archos charged quickly. I don't know why they don't ship a normal charger."
2,Could be a great device....but worst customer service ever!,The device is pretty cool. The weak battery life is a serious minus. The TV Schedule upload doesn't work and therefore I cannot use the DVR functions of my docking station...and since getting help from their tech support is impossible (I have been trying to get someone for the past 2 weeks!!!!!!!!!) I am considering returning it to get a Zen vision even if it only has 30GB (my Archos has 160GB). What a shame! This product had so much potential - but the frustration of dealing with such incompetent buffoons has taken all the joy out of the experience.
2,Beleive the negative reviews on service,"I purchased the 80Gb 605 in Feb. of 2008 despite the reviews complaining of service/support after the purchase. This is a good unit..until it breaks. I sent my 605 in for a simple battery replacement Dec 10th,2008,was informed it would take 10 to 15 days to complete the repair and waited.The automated response to an RMA inquiry on the 29th of December indicated that although my RMA number was valid, my unit was not in the warehouse nor in shipping.Two calls to support and one email has left me with a promise to send tracking information..no such info as of Jan 7,2009. Just a warning to all, the complaints of poor service are true."
3,Good but WiFi not great,This product does pretty much what it says I have been able to hook to my Dish and transfer programs and hook up the DVR adaptor and record Viedo from my DVD player and another Sat. Reciever. However the WiFi is very wimpy. I have the WiFi hotspot downstairs in my house and upstairs I have a very difficult time getting WiFi Reception. I have not yet been out and about with it. But I am less than impressed with the capabilities of the WiFi and the antenna seems to be right where your hands would go if you were holdong it.
3,Great video quality with built in WIFI,"Amazing PMP with great video quality, built in WIFI, plenty of memory at a reasonable price. After downloading the opera browser and surfing the web I have noticed some annoying freezes. The battery life seems substantially less than my previous archos av500 but I have yet to test it continuously while watching videos."
4,Title,Got what was ordered and expected in timely fashion! word word word word word word word word word word word
1,Crippled product from a greedy company,"This is a product that is crippled by its low volume level that cannot be increased. Don't plan to use this on a plane or really any kind of travel unless you get a headphones amplifier device... inconvenience and added price.Oh, while I'm talking about added price, get ready for Archos to get in your pocket. Want to web browse? You have to buy the browser. Want to play certain kinds of video or audio? You have to buy the codecs... I'm not kidding. And they aren't cheap.After a few of these prompts, I wanted to throw the thing through the wall, but I knew I'd have trouble returning it if I did. Just skip this and get the better products from Creative, Cowon, or others. You'll be glad you did."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Ok, I have had this product for about 18 months. It was always a problem, and I was iffy on it. Well, now the product has exploded. In that something within the case has expanded and blown the case open. And, I have never kept it in a hot area (e.g., inside of a car -- never happened). I searched the internet, and this isn't the first time that this has happened. Archos provides lousy support and I'm just out of luck. I would never buy an archos product again."
3,Good but..,"Good quality, but you must buy the wifi browser in the archos website to use internet. and it cost 40 euros.i dont like this.overall is a good player."
2,Archos 605,"Archos 605 Wi-Fi Portable Media Player (160 GB)Archos 605 Wi-Fi Portable Media Player (160 GB)Unit is nicely made, BUT hard to accomplish what i needed or wanted - Playing DVD's.Customer support is short, and hard to get to. Unit hangs often, requiring a reboot."
4,Archos 605 Wi-Fi 160GB,"The Archos 605 Wi-Fi 160GB is a great personal media player, but there are a few design flaws that need to be addressed. I'm afraid that the design of the control buttons that are along the right side are fragile enough to be accidentally pulled loose under the right conditions, and to replace the battery, you need to send the unit in. The pullout stand on the back of the unit is a little weak, but works great. The interface is a little slow, and i'm still trying to figure out all the functions. The instruction manual is in 5 languages, but still doesn't give you all the information you need. However, the screen is awesome for both pics and video, and it hold my whole CD collection with lots of room to spare for video and pictures. The headphones sound great, but the exteral speaker is a little weak. Definately would recommend, but would probably save my money and get the 30GB if I had to do over again and if the price is right."
3,someone help me out,"i got my first one and had charging problems and ordered new onei put about 100-200 videos on it with 2000+ songsthe touchscreen doesnt work anymorei read the manual and called tech supporti tryed the TV/LCD holding when turning it on and it goes to a white screen to restart the touch screenit tells me to plug into the computer with the USB and when i do... nothing happensit crashes a lot, but the only problem i want fixed is the touch screen, it is very frustrating to have to use only side buttons all the timei really dont want to try to get a new one because of the chances i will get a nother defective unit and the time it will take to arrivei also do not want to transfer over 120gigs of media again"
3,Lou'.,"Well ok. I just recieved the Archos 605 Wi-Fi 30 GB,and so far its alright. Music files go in easily, video looks very clear, etc.But ive been having a bit of a problem.I go to the Content Portal, and try to activate that, so it tells me to go to the Archos website and download Firmware.Well, ive tried that already, and when its done, i tired to open the firmware file, but its un-openable, if that makes sense; its not readable, and it looks like you need a certain program to open it, so im wondering, if anybody here can help me out with this problem. i appreciate it very much if so."
2,To much restrictions,"Archos needs to know that people like me use real money to buy their products and it is a sin to have so much restrictions with such poor battery life and every little thing you have to buy like browser, widgets. Plus you can only transfer 2 or 4 gigs at a time this is rediculus they need to need to know that human been just like them has a brain too, not only them"
2,"Hmmm, I think ipod touch is better.","PROS:Great large screen.Plays various file types.80GB HDD.CONS:Battery life is very short! Under normal usage, mine only lasted 3 hours.Balky and heavy.Volume is very low.Video gets choppy during HDD access.Customer service almost does not exist.I decided to return and got an ipod touch."
2,Only worked for 24 hours,"Got my 605 wifi after waiting over 2 months (way to long), got it charged and had just started loading it when it reset itself and flashed an error message. Gave the option to fix it, but would not called the company and now I have to return it, and it could take up to 45 days (their minimum estimate) to receive a replacement. NOT IMPRESSED.User guide leaves alot to be desired, but hopefully the replacement will work properly."
5,Great ball!,I play pick-up ball at the local gym. This ball is always the game ball. Wide channel key for ball handling.
2,Hate the feel,"I thought I was getting a TF-1000 like I've played with before. I didn't realize what ""deep channel"" meant, but I hate it. It's very grippy which some people may like, but it doesn't have the right feel like the leather balls I grew up using. I found another in a sporting good store without the deep channels and it felt much better."
3,Regular TF-1000 is the better choice,"I've always been a huge fan of the TF-1000, so on my birthday I decided to treat myself to the basketball. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the ZK Pro and since it was being called ""Pro"", it made me think twice. So I bought the ZK Pro. I don't hate it, but I do wish I had bought the original. I've had it for over a month and I thought the grip would break in...it hasn't. People at the gym complain, along with me, that it gets too slippery when you play with it. I have been a fanatic about the TF-1000 since I was a kid, and I can honestly tell you the original is much better!"
2,Don't like the deep channel design.,"I purchased ZK-Pro 28.5 size for my kid. After bouncing it and getting to feel of the ball, the deep channels were awkward. So, I returned it to Amazon. Maybe if I kept it, I might have gotten used to the deep channel.I'm glad I returned and I got the regular TF-1000. Actually, I prefer Wilson Evolution. It has a much better feel. The leather is bit more 'cushiony'. Some may not like this cushiony feel, but I prefer it over TF's tacky feel. I have both TF-1000 and Evolution.Only reason I got the TF-1000 is because it is used in my kid's games almost always. If they didn't participate in games that use TF-1000, I would go for Wilson Evolution."
5,Great ball,Exactly what we wre looking for. Came quickly and packaged very well. This is a great indoor ball for young players. This one was for my daughter and we have the same ball for her twin brother. Both love the ball.
4,Great Introduction to Obscure New Age Artists,"This was actually one of my first ""New Age"" music purchases back when New Age was still cool and novel. It features a nice selection of artists who were hard to find elsewhere, and have remained so. This is great music for background soundscapes when you really don't want to be distracted by catchy melodies or hooky beats. It helped me wade through two anthologies of American literature in college. This album is out of print. I also think that the Lyfestyle label is out of business. A pity they never made a Volume 2."
2,blue topaz earrings,"The earrings are a good size but the color on the website is misleading. They are not the vibrant, tropical blue you'd expect from blue topaz. They are very pale blue---more like aquamarine. Nice earrings all the same, but if I'd have known the color was not the correct hue I'd have kept looking elsewhere."
5,Outstanding Jazz Vocalist,"Lucy Reed has mellowed over the years - in this CD she comes across as a seasoned professional. Her voice is smooth and easy to listen to, the songs were artfully chosen - new and refreshing even in the 90s. Highly recommended."
2,An enthusiastic american group plays african music,"This album is from a NW US group of african music lovers. It includes many songs with vocals, so it is not simply marimba music. I found it's production relatively amaturish compared to music available from native Zimbabwe musicians."
4,Tremendous drive and organization.,"Very danceable, lively productions: I'd love to play these recordings for elementary school kids and get them dancing, for Boka Marimba's most accessible sound is the perfect introduction to spirited Zimbabwe marimba for all ages."
4,Power Supply Tester,"Pros: After I figured out how to use it, this device works well! I was able to quickly determine which power supplies were bad. I bought it because it had a screen to tell you the actual voltages on each rail.Cons: The instruction sheet is worthless. It is written in bad English. I does not tell you what the screen is indicating. The one 12v indicator was flashing. I discovered that this meant that the P4 connector was not hooked up. The instructions sheet does not tell you that you have to have the motherboard connector plugged in to test the 12v and 5v rails.Did not give it 5 stars due to the bad instruction sheet. I would recommend this to anyone, but be prepared to experiment till you figure out how to use it."
2,makes them even lazier,so loud that i couldn't even watch tv while she played with it and wasn't as fast as i thought it would be just lazily sways the birdie from one side to another...it amused my cat because it wouldn't stop swaying but just left her watching it instead of actually playing with it...might as well get a fish tank
1,Do not recommend,"The item is absolutely inpractical to use and of very poor design quality for the price. My unit was noisy when in motion, not controllable by the remote control and absolutely unatractive (if not scary) for my cats. Don't waste your time and money."
3,Toy,"This toy kinda wore off after a bit (cats got bored) and doesn't do real good on carpet. I have moved and have not taken it out of the box for months now. Maybe I will try again, I soak the end in cat nip too."
1,oh dear me,"I have never before had to push myself so hard just to finish a book, I can easily say this is the worst book I've ever read. I couldn't care one way or another about any of the MANY characters, the author tries way too hard to give them depth and falls horribly short. The story line jumps from people to people and place to place leaving huge gaps that make no sense. I wouldn't even recommened using this book for a fire starter."
4,Spanish edition bibles,"I purchased two different bibles the same day. This Bible was selected as the easiest to read by our Hispanic Pastor for his members. We then purchased a case of this Bible for his Church and they are happy with the purchase. My reason for only 4 stars, instead of five, is that the print is still very tiny."
4,very pleased,"I'm pleased and excited with this bible. It's in great condition, very beautiful, a wonderful tool for inspiration and instruction"
1,Spanish Bible,"I expected the original edition not a 1960 revision. Something like the King James version in English, I think this was misrepresented."
3,Budget minded book,"The RV is a relatively 'traditional' popular translation and familiar to many Spanish speaking Christians.This book is inexpensive... and the quality of the paper and binding reflect that... ergo, I give it a ""so-so"" rating. I would not expect this product to be long lasting. i will purchase diferently next time."
1,Weaker than my grandma,This knife was so cheap and weak it barely cuts through bread. I should've tried it immediately so I could return it!
5,Great knife for the price!,"I got this for my husband several years ago and he just loves it. It works well, cleans well, and stores very compact. I almost went with a more expensive one but am glad I gave this one a chance because we're very happy with it."
1,Blades wiggle too much to control,"Actually, my husband and I ended up both buying the same knife. We used the one he bought one time and threw it out because the blades wiggled so much. It was impossible to create nice slices, the meat really looked ""butchered"", nothing I'd serve to a guest. So, I sent this one back unused."
2,hard to grip,"I used this last night for the first time for carving my T-giving turkey. It STINKS. The handle, when slick with grease from the turkey, is nearly impossible to hold. Your hand slips forward and it is nearly impossible to push the button. I had to use two hands to hold it, which is less than desirable. Plus, it barely had enough power to cut through some real small ligaments. Overall, not worth your time. Why they make it with a slippery plastic with nothing to provide a sure non-slip gripping surface is beyond me."
1,A blade with a vibrator attached to it...,"I've used good electric knives. This is no ""bargain"". I don't care how cute the box it came with is, this knife is USELESS. The motor wiggles the blade side to side just as much as it does back and forth. Consequently it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A STRAIT CUT OUT OF THIS THING. Bought it. Made one slice. Returning it. Done."
3,So Close and Yet So Far,"Before purchasing this electric knife I read the reviews of all electriic knives available on Amazon. I concluded that all of them had proponents and detractors. Logic dictated going low end. I gave this knife three stars because it battled it's way through three large briskets rather well. That's the good news. The bad news is that it was an exhausting experience. The knife is shaped so that the portion one needs to grasp to reach the trigger is too short for a man's hand and the remainder of the knife is too thick to be grasped comfortably. The trigger seems to be designed to make a greasy finger slip off. Had the people who designed this knife actually used it, it might have become a really good knife. Lengthen the grippable part of the handle and lengthen the trigger 3/8"" and I suspect I'd give it a fourth or even fifth star.AHS"
2,Not great,"I loved the Hamilton Beach knife I had for 20 years. I don't love this one. I have small hands and this is not ergonomically suited for me. It is awkard to the point of being dangerous. The knife cut is ok, but not clean. It shreads alot."
1,VERY HARD TO USE,"I PURCHASED THE KNIFE BASED ON THE NAME HAMILTON BEACH. I HAVE A STRONG HAND BUT THE KNIFE IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE. TOO MUCH PRESSURE IS NEEDED WHILE CUTTING. ALTHOUGH THE PRICE IS RIGHT, IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
1,This was not designed for human hands,"The handle is way too big, so when you try to cut the turkey, you can't get a grip on it. It slides around, so the finger slips off the trigger. I wonder what were they thinking when they made this product. Box is crappy quality - it's brittle inside.Would not recommend buying this. Go try some out in the store, and make sure the grip is smaller and more ergonomical, otherwise, you'll be as frustrated as I am if you get some grease from the turkey on your hands."
1,DREADFUL,Terrible ergonomics! It was SO difficult and uncomfortable to keep the trigger engaged and carve at the same time. My hand was ACHING by the time I'd carved the brisket. I've never used a more awkward or uncomfortable appliance!
4,For home use it's all you need,"I wouldn't want to carve up a steer with this knife, but for everyday use in the kitchen it will do just fine. People who know enough to let the tool do the work at its own pace will probably have this knife for a lifetime. People who insist on forcing things will probably add this knife to all the other gadgets they've ruined."
4,Excellent electric knife for quick jobs.,"I bought this electric knife specifically for carving turkey and ham. I only use it twice a year on average, but I've owned this model for a few years. For quick work, carving one turkey, etc, it's great.The blades are short enough to allow easy maneuverability, and they stay tight together so they cut rather than shredding the meat. They're also long enough to get the full length of a turkey breast or width of the ham in a single slice. The trigger is far better than button models that I've used before.However, if you're planning to use this for a long time, the handle itself isn't the most comfortable, my hand tends to cramp after about 10 minutes of use. If it gets any bit of fat or other food on it, the handle can be fairly slippery too. I'll usually wrap it in a paper towel to help prevent this.All in all, I'm happy with it and would definitely recommend this knife."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I purchased this product in a retail store for about half the online price, as I needed to replace a very old Hamilton Beach knife that was broken. It was very difficult to find a knife that didn't take up a huge amount of space, and this one came with its own storage case that can be placed in a drawer or cabinet. After two uses, I can say no food ended up between the blades, and it cut up a fresh pineapple beautifully. However, when slicing a preformed processed turkey breast, my hand became very fatigued for two reasons. First, the blade eject is on top of the handle where I need to hold the knife, and second, the handle is very large and I cannot grip it easily.At the price point I found, I'll work with this knife when I need an electric one. However, if I find one better designed ergonmically that utlizes minimal space, I'll pay more for it."
4,electric knife,"Product arrived in good condition and in a timely manner.Product was given as gift, and gratefully accepted."
1,delevery time poor,Takes orders and does not have them in stock. Will have to wait 2 mths to get me order.
1,Don't buy,Doesn't slice well at all. Very noisey. Not easy to carve with. Pain to clean so don't waste your money.
1,Biggest Piece of you know what,"This was either a faulty electric knife or the product is poorly made. It would go for a couple of seconds then stop, then go a couple for second or two."
3,Slippery Knife - Bad Box,Having owned a Hamilton Beach electric knife for years I was very disappointed in this one. If your like me and get a little grease on your fingers cutting turkey. You will find your finger slips off the trigger (I got around that by wrapping a paper towel around the unit.)As someone else mentioned. The box is impossible to open.Oh the knife cuts fine. But the box and slippery trigger must have been designed by someone who doesn't use either of them in the real world.
1,too hot to handle,"I am returning this item. As the other reviewers wrote, the blade wiggles sideways making it difficult to slice cleanly. Also the handle gets very hot to the touch. I had a hard time holding it after a few minutes. This machine does not do justice to what a wonderful tool an electric knife can be."
1,Maybe mine is defective but it is terrible.,"I tried it for the 1st time today cutting a loaf from the local bakery. Had a hard time with the thick crust. After 6 slices, motor started to smell. Everyone else seems to like theirs. Maybe mine's defective? I am sending it back."
5,Great Knife,"I replaced my 35+ year old electric knife with this one - wow, I didn't realize how dull it had gotten! I like the case - it was a little tricky to get into the first time, but the old one didn't have one - it's nice to be able to store it all together. Nice and sharp."
4,Hamilton Beach Electric Knife,"Very good service, expect the same from the knife when I use it. Like the Hamilton Beach 74250 Carve 'N Set Electric Knife with case, white."
1,CHEAP,Cheap. Broke something on the inside of the handle. Can hear somethingplastic rattling around inside of is. Just out of the warranty periodby 2 weeks. Dang the luck. DON'T BUY!
2,it vibrates and do not slice properly.,This was purchased to replace an identical knife. The left blade on the one being replaced would not lock in so it wouldn't travel. The entire assembly vibrated and did not slice properly.
3,Probably as good as any but far to weak to cut through semi frozen meat.,"I bought this to help me carve through fairly large blocks of boneless frozen chicken (about 10lbs each), even partially defrosted the knife does not make any headway through the meat. I suppose asking it to do what I need is more than it is designed for :). in any case it does seem like a decent electric knife for normal purposes."
1,Discussed,"This was suppossed to be a new Electric carving knife, the box has food marks on it the knife has food dried on the handle. I have written three letters giving him both telephone numbers and still no reply. Amazon ought to cancel his ability to sell using their good name."
3,Nice and cheap,"This is my second purchase, my review is basically of experiences with the first item.The nice is heavy, has a short cord, heats easily, and does not cut through everything. However, it cuts my roast well, and after getting used to it, becomes easy to use.The box is not hard to open. The tabs need to be pressed. The plastic is maliable so it does take a concerted efort, but i would not call it hard.This new one has a very cheap piece of plastic to hold the items in place. I am dissapointred in that.All in all, for twenty bucks, this is a decent knife for occasional use of standard meats. Hey, i bought this a second time (the first still works well, i just needed a second one)."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a great disappointment. Too much of it is devoted to general homeopathy and not specifically targetted to dental. What was there for dental was rather disappointing too. For example, for teeth clenching or grinding, he says to buy another book on Bach Flower Remedies."
5,Dental Homoeopathy,"This is an excellent book and is being used as the standard for candidates for the diploma in dental homeopathy of the faculty of homeopathy in London. There is an excellent chapter on Mercury fillings and many dentists and patients will find it not only useful for dental homeopathic treatment but also for a good basis for general homeopathic conditions. As vice - chairman of the British Homeopathic Dental Association , I can highly reccommend this book to all interested in oral and dental health"
3,nice book,"This book is a good introduction to homeopathy in the dental field....however, it lacks references. Clinicians need to rely upon solid scientific background"
2,Sludge Remover,"I have used this for about a month, adding each week at water change and I have not noticed an improvement on leaf edges and rocks."
3,Pretty Basic Information,"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book, as I have high expectations of a book from Dr. Stoelting. However, I found that this book contains only basic information. It is good for a quick reference, but if you are looking for in-depth information about a specific topic, you will have to look elsewhere."
2,"This book is frustrating, but unfortunately necessary","I have used this book over the last 9-12 months to study for my part I ANZCA exam. It is frustrating to use at times, often containing contradictory or imprecise statements. It definately contains several errors (including but not limited to the structures of sevoflurane and etidocaine). It is now becomming rather out of date (examiners often expect more up to date information than this). The chapters and sections themselves are well organised, but within paragraphs organisation is often a bit lacking.Also, the physiology section is not particularly usefull, being too brief to be worthwhile in studying for exams.Unfortunately I do not know of any other book dedicated to anaesthetic pharmacology that covers the topics in the appropriate amount of detail without being too massive to be managable. So we will still be forced to use it for now. Let's hope a new edition comes out soon that is much improved!!"
5,The Personal Touch,"This book should be a part of every business owners library. So many business owners have ventured so far from many of the business practices in this book that they will never aspire to the success of Ms. Williams.This book is practical, well thought out,easily read, and you can use the principles in your daily life of how you are to treat people. This is not just a book for business people this is a book for all people.After reading this book it forced me to examine the way I have conducted my life and business relationships.I now make it a habit to return all calls and emails as quickly as possible.Buy this book for your friends and family it will truly change your thought process and you will begin to utilize The Personal Touch in your own life and certainly every aspect of your business."
5,Terrie opens you a new world,"Terrie gives you a lesson in Public Relations. In a era of mortal competence, Terrie teaches you that the competence is just with yourself and, of course, you never know............"
3,Personal Touch,"I really enjoyed the book written by Terrie Williams. Ms. Williams brought out much needed things that we humans of today seem to have forgotten.If more people would adhere to the principles of personal touch, the world would be a better place to live and we as humans would not be under so much stress.One of my Teachers once wrote in my autograph book upon graduation the saying,""To suceed, you must proceed to exceed"". I think Ms. Williams said that many times in her book in many different ways.She made me think back to basics, and that ""Common sense is no longer common. Personal Touch could be sub titled ""Good News"". Which means Gospel.I highly recommend this book to anyone who strives to be sucessful."
3,Intereresting Read but not much more,This is interesting to read if you want to read about someone else's success. It is a very general book and doesnt really give you any advice or insite on how to get ahead in life or business. Its worth checking out in the library but not much more.
3,"just okay,",The sound quality seemed to be a bit off on this cd. It arrived on time with no other defects.
1,Price,"Perhaps more people would read this book if the electronic edition didn't cost twice as much as my e-reader. While I understand the author/publisher/etc need to be paid for their work, I find incomprehensible that someone would find it adequate to even offer the book at such a price in today's day and age.Good luck with that business model."
1,Stopped working after 3 months!,"Stopped working after 3 months. It shuts off because it thinks its tank is full, even though I have the hose in the back going to a external pump. I wish it stopped working before the return policy expired. Hopefully the company honors the 1 yr limited warranty."
1,"ADDers are bad, wrong, and evolutionarily inferior","In this very unfortunate book, Russell Barkley suggests that the root and core of ADHD is to be found in the work of Darwin and the science of evolution. In other words, those with ADHD are evolutionarily inferior to the rest of us. He further suggest that people with ADHD are morally deficient: ""If those with ADHD are like the first or second of the three little pigs in the children's fable of that name and the rest of us are like the third, their fate is clear even to a kindergartner -- they deserve the wolf that comes for them"" (page 314). I had hoped for a more balanced, less condescending, and more useful book. Unfortunately, this is not it."
1,Worthless,"I don't mean to be mean, but this book gave me no new information about ADD. It is the same info from everything else that I have read."
5,"Essential reading for professionals, parents, ADHD adults","The previous reviewer (Bethesda, MD; 12/22/98) takes one quote out of context and grossly distorts its meaning. Dr. Barkley actually discusses the fact that *many individuals in our society* believe persons with ADHD ""deserve what they get."" Dr. Barkley does not possess such a callous attitude. As other reviewers have noted, this book is a remarkable synthesis of research in psychology, evolutionary biology, and the neurosciences. The theory Barkley proposes will undoubtedly be refined as researchers put it to the test. However, I suspect that in 20 years we'll look back and wonder how we could have thought ADHD was primarily an ""attention disorder"" as opposed to an impairment in response inhibition and self-regulation."
4,good info,this was a great book to share with my students. We took out a lot of useful information. The book came in good condition.
1,More of the same,Those of you who have read other books by Barkley have already read this one. It is the same thing over and over and over again. Don't waste your money.
3,Gummy,"The taste of these drops is a good sweet licorice taste, however they're a gummy texture which I'm not too fond of, they stick to your teeth."
2,Disappointing!,"Not at all what I expected or had hoped for.The flavor was rather bland, with a jelly like texture. More like a gum drop than anything else.Very gummy when chewed and sticks to your teeth pretty good so if that is your taste then these are for you.Unfortunately, not for me."
4,Joe Don Looney,"Joe Don Looney was a sports idol to me as a young man growing up in Oklahoma. I knew little about him at that time except he was a great football player on my favorite football team. I was very disappointed when he was kicked off the OU Football team in 63. As time went on and Joe Don faded away I was always curious what happened to him. I know the author J Brent Clark as I was the same age and we played together as children in Holdenville, OK.Brent's book on Joe Don Looney sheds considerable light on his behavior growing up in Texas where the legend begins and ends. If you wanted to know about Joe Don this is a good book to read and find out alot about him. A little sad to me and tragic in it's own way, but interesting. Enjoyed the book very much.Rest in Peace Joe Don Looney."
2,The truth about this show,This was a hilarious show and I enjoyed every minute I watched of it. But even for buying it cheap and used is a rip off. You get 8 episodes and apparently a bonus one. Which could not find after searching for 20 minutes and looking it up. You get a making of the show and the usual behind the scenes and a cool D12 music video. The thing is you can watch all these episodes free on you tube. The episodes are really short and there's ONLY 8! I suggest you just watch these on youtube unless your a hardcore eminem fan like me and need everything.
3,Not their best,"Community Music was more brash/aggressive. This album is fine but lacks the edge. A little to ""pop"" for my tastes."
3,Haven't seen any result on my kids yet,It claimed it will take a while to make the scar go away. Haven't seen any result on my kids yet
2,Purple blotch on my kids face!,"Love Mederma. Love it. I'm one of those people who gets bug bites out the wazoo and Mederma helps scars heal. So, when one of my beautiful daughters needed stitches on her forehead after falling down in the grocery store (don't ask), I bought the kids Mederma. Um... no. So here's the deal. It looks like purple jelly. It says it dries clear. I put it on her forehead/face. It stayed purple. So basically it made an already ugly looking scar look a hundred times worse because now instead of being just a scar, it also now had a big purple blob of jelly on it. It made her feel self conscious so I finally stopped putting it on. But I was annoyed I had spent so much money on it.Bottom line - get the adult version and put it on your children. Same stuff, just not purple.Good luck!"
3,Okay,"The size was not what I had expected I thought I was getting the bigger one, so it was a bit costly for that size"
1,Fire the Mederma product manager!,"What was Mederma thinking?? There is NOTHING written on the box that this product is bright purple and stains clothing. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Mederma but I think the product manager should be fired for stupidity. Clearly this person does not have children. The product does not dry instantly and even when dry it rubs off and stains everything. I thought the kids version would just be a milder version of the adult one but the only difference I see is the coloring. Don't waste your money on this and buy the original version of Mederma (which is clear!)"
2,Not very durable,"I have had this for 1.5 years, and the plastic spindle has cracked in many places. I can't even grate cheese now. Will be moving to something made out of less plastic."
3,HB 70550RL food processor,"The price was right, but the lid tries to pop off when just grating cheese. but it works okay, and it arrived in good condition and in a reasonable amount of time."
3,Should have listened....,I did quite a bit of research before I purchased this food processor. I even read all of the negative/mediocre reviews and decided to try it for myself anyway (hey it was only $25.) My original intent was to make Pesto (my garden is full of basil). For pesto this machine works fine except that the S-blade is difficult to clean. Somehow food works up into the inside of the blade. The second time I used this food processor the feed tube broke! I was doing parmesean cheese (per the instruction guide) and the bottom of the tube snapped off inside the food processor.It did slice vegetables nicely and the pesto came out great...so I guess if you are going to use this processor for light work it is great but eventually I will move up to a nicer more durable model.
1,Not a good buy,"Don't waste your money with this one. Yes, it is cheap.... but it is cheap in every sense of the word. The very first time I used it, a part of the chute broke off. I could still use it though, although food crumbs sometimes got everywhere. Today, a mere 6 months after purchasing, the small plastic part of the shredding attachment broke off completely. This made my processor completely unable to shred or slice anything. The chopper still works, but it's such a hassle to use I think I will just trash it and get a different model, from a different brand."
1,Similar problem - it died!,I was going to make Christmas cookies and didn't even get to cream the butter and sugar! The butter was softened and I only had 1 pound (4 sticks) in the processor. It just stopped and never started again.
3,Beware of the blade,"I bought this foodprocessor recently and have used it only twice with good performance. But when I was washing it before the first use, the blade piece easily sliped and gave me a real deep cut in one of my fingers. The shape of this piece is conic and has nothing to grip to. If you buy this machine, please BEWARE OF THE BLADE."
1,Do not buy this. Dead out of the box,"We bought this unit from a small local store that is known for selling only quality merchandise. We took it out of the box, assembled it following the directions -- and the blade doesn't spin. It does't even engage. The motor runs, but absolutely nothing happens. I've learned my lesson! Read reviews before you buy anything, folks."
1,Food Shredder,When trying to use the slicing feature the processor shreds all the ingredients. Initially it slices but all once that food is in the bowl it then gets shredded by the blades as you put more food in. The cost of this appliance appears to be economical but you will eventually have to buy a better product.
1,Go with a better model,"I bought this ""piece of junk"" at Wal*Mart. I was actually surprised to see a food processor so cheap, so I decided to buy it.After going home and washing the product, I decided to try it out. I plugged it in and NOTHING. It didn't even budge!Anyway, I am going to have to drive ALL THE WAY back to Wal*Mart and return this...Save your money and go with a more expensive model that will last you.."
1,Bought at Target--and it was already used!!!!!,"I had been researching processors for a while and was on a limited budget so I went with this one ($30 on sale). I got home so excited to check it out and it had a starnge discoleration on the blade shaft. I went on to investigate it and realized there was sticky, gross food all over it!!! OUTRAGEOUS! Then I plugged it in, and of course it didn't work. I don't know what the people who owned it before me did to it, but it obviously couldn't take it.Now I wonder if they just packed it up and returned it, or if Target was responsible for this! No wonder it was on sale!"
2,Very low grade plastic cracked immediately,It's well worth spending 30% more to get a more robust machine with better parts and container. I knew better: small kitchen appliances should start at $60 at least if you want them to last more than 2 years. This one didn't last 2 weeks. My bad. This is a toy and not suited for repeated use over the years.The motor seems like it could power a house. Too bad it will see little use.
2,Not worth the problems,I've owned this food processor for about 2 years. Today when I tried to use it the knob barely moved as food must have entered the mechanism. Then when I tipped it over I noticed there was a big melted hole in the bottom! I'd rather pay more for a quality food processor which won't be a fire hazard.
1,[affordable] but worthless,I had finally found a food processor that I could easily afford. Now I know why. I got to use it twice. It worked like a gem the first time. The second time I was mixing a very thick batter and it just stopped and decided never to start again. Apparently the engine couldn't handle it. I recommend spending the extra money on ones that have good strong reputable mechanics--now I know why they cost so much more.
2,I too had trouble,"Having had a number of food processors thru my 25 years of marriage I found this to be the one I liked least. I also had trouble with the tab that goes into the slot where it joins on the bowl. Te plastic part that was on the shredder disc came apart and it is big and clumbsy to use. No matter what it says It has only one speed. The food gets caught under the blades easily and sometimes getting the blades down takes an act of congress to do. I am having to purchase a new one and it will not be like this one. My daughter has had the same problems with the same brand, different model. I would not recommend this for anyone who will use it on an almost daily basis."
2,Good until I put it in the dishwasher,"As one of the reviews already says, I loved this machine and it was a terrific bargain. However, the dishwasher (top shelf, mind you) warped the bowl so badly that I couldn't even put its cover on it anymore."
4,First World Series for Royals,"For any of us from Kansas City, the World Series was a long time coming. This video brings back some of the stars and heartbreak of that series, yet it is good to see George Brett, Amos Otis, Hal McRae, Willie Aikens, and others battle the resilient Phillies. Unfortunately, there were some tracking problems with my copy--hence the 4 stars."
3,Not for starters,I bought this book to begin understanding of finite elements theory. the book is good but sure not for starters. The lack of examples and introduction to computer software make this book limited at least for me.
3,"Good, difficult read with software foulup","The text is obviously considered a benchmark for FEA. The date of the first edition causes me to guess that it was among the first serious texts in the subject. For that reason, the book is worth the some of the price. But, detractors reduce the worth...Two major items detract from the usefulness of the text:1. It is written for a mathematician. So, reading is a little rough for those who are learning the notation as they read the book.2. The text spends pages describing examples using and an appendix providing user information for software that is missing from the reprint. This subtracts from the value, even if the code is a source in FORTRAN, because excellent examples of FEA implementations are missing.It turns out that the source code and a compiled executable for DLEARN is available on the web. However, you have to know where and how to search. [...]"
3,"Good, but....","The first reviewer states that the code is available for download. The text references this non existant code throughout the entire volume but it cannot be found anywhere. The site referenced in the book;""NOTE: The software described in this book may be downloaded from www.zace.com"",does not have the download although it does have a reference to a high cost seminar in Europe by the author. Also, this site refuses eMail inquiries. I finally gave up and purchased the older hard copy version which at least has the ""old"" source for DLEARN. Other than this frustrating nonsence by the author, it is a good FEA study."
3,A decent reference,"This book is a decent reference to have in your collection. The book does do a decent job of presenting some of the mathematical rigor associated with the FEM. However, I would not recommend it for use in a FEM course. I think students find the initial introduction to FEM somewhat confusing."
2,"Chip failed, maker replaced","After I had shot and unloaded a few hundred photos, it got so I couldn't shoot without getting either corrupted images or a refusal message from the camera. I contacted Kingston and they replaced the chip at no cost (including postage). Meanwhile I bought a 1 Gb SanDisk chip that has given no trouble, and so far I haven't tested the new 500 Mb Kingston chip."
3,Did not work with my Motorola V360,"Pros- Very cheap, handy and store about 100 songs.Cons- It did not work with my Motorola V360 phone. I transferred songs from my computer to the 512 mb microsd card and inserted in the phone. The phone does not recognize the microsd card and suggested me to format it. When I started to format, it failed to format. My phone is working fine with 64 mb microsd card."
3,mildly enlightening if you are not a Brit,"While the book purports to be about terrorism, to a great extent it is British perspectives on British politics and the relation between Britain and the U.S.A. It is both mildly enlightenting and entertaining, though the specific messages and themes are repeated multiple times. That is a result of compiling individual articles originally written for various British publications, without editing out the redundancies, and calling it a book.If you want the political perspective, there are better sources of information.If you are attracted by the point of view of ""a founding member of Monty Python"" (to quote the subtitle) and want the humor, stick with Monty Python."
4,To the Left of the Left,"I consider myself to be too liberal for the Democrats, but Terry Jones is to the left of even me. Factually fascinating, his opinions are sure to inflame even the most unperterbable of conservatives. This is Bush bashing at its best. I hightly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know the real truth behind the Bush administration agenda. It is also relatively short and an easy read, although some of the information is already out of date."
2,"Redundant, repetitive, reiterative bushwacking","Being huge fan of Monty Python and Terry Jones' independent endeavours (such as Eric the Viking, Goblin Companion, and them Pressed Fairies) I had rather high expectations of this book which partly explains my bitter dissapointment. But only partly. This book is a collection of shallow opinion pieces from TJ's column bound together with minimal editing. As a result some of the material appears rather dated, many arguments and jabs at Bush and Blair are repeated throughout the book with little variation, and what's really surprising a large fraction of them are unoriginal and unfunny. Being an avid reader of The Onion and the Daily Show with John Stewart junkie I didn't not find much in this book that wasn't articulated already by some other comedian or the Dixie Chicks. Monties - or Pythons - were never known for their political insight, but this one seems to have developed a case of osteoporosis in his funny bone..."
1,Shamefull,"Why does gifted comedians, actors and music stars think they are automatically gifted with political wisdom?That TJ was funny in the Monty Python context doesn't a priori give him clout in political thinking, does it?The left wing raging about Bush and Blair tells me more of Bush and Blair doing things right then the wisdom of a comedian.The writing might be cloaked in ""satire"" (aka lefties way of getting away with nonsense) but it's none the less just hate propaganda.Shame on TJ."
1,Sings Cole Porter,"We love his earlier music. But this much later edition leaves this previously wonderful singer totally wanting. We listened to each selection and found nothing of any merit in comparison to his earlier works, plus the accompaniment was equally awful. And we are in the non-profit field of providing musically underserved Philadelphia school children with a wide range of music education programs through an organization called Musicopia (previously Strings for Schools). Absolutely don't buy it-or you can our purchase free."
1,john gary sings cole porter,This performance was a collosal disappointment. The person singing on this cd doesn't even sound like john gary. If I could get my money back I would. This was a travesty.
5,John Gary - Master of Expression,"As an opera fan for many years, I have heard the greatest voices from the past 100 years, including John Gary. Although John is no Caruso, neither Caruso nor any of the opera Greats could claim greater voices than our own John Gary. I was most skeptical when a friend told me back in 1965 of a voice he had heard that had a 3-octive range. I quickly conceded that John Gary had an incredible range, with the lowest notes as pure and easy and the very highest. He makes it all seem so effortless. But even more, is the poetical expression and warmth that he captures in each song which can bring tears to your eyes. I was very saddened to learn that John Gary recently pass away. I keep checking the Amazon.com to see if they have release any of this earlier albums in CD. Although I have several of his albums, I no longer have the equipment to adequately play them. I would also be interested in his biography if one has beem written."
5,Brava Diva!,"The only bad thing about a Niki Haris recording is that it leaves the listener wanting more recorded music. Formerly a back up singer for Madonna, Haris has the pipes to blow all the competition out of the water. Her vocal capabilities are up to par in her earlier spotty dance releases where she commands attention and sends her vocal range to the heavens to knock open the pearly gates. Here, Haris commits to Jazz renditions where we are able to hear and appreciate her ability to weave subtle vocal nuances around the melodies. She soars and caresses along the various tracks and those not familiar with her work really need to listen to a true professional diva in action."
1,Poster?,"If you have a printer and some photo paper you can have this for free. The title says its a poster, and perhaps I should of read the dimensions better but this is just a piece of photo paper folks. Don't waste your money."
5,Perfect little bag,"This bag is very well made and has several pockets. Although the bag is not actually large enough for magazines to fit inside, there is an outer pocket that I put them in. Bag is large enough for a couple of sodas or water bottles and other neccessary items. I would purchase this again as this was a great value."
4,A very handy bag!,"It holds a good bit without feeling too bulky. The canvas material is very sturdy. At first I was a bit worried about the buttons, but they are there for design. Behind the buttons are velcro strips for easy opening. I like the fact that the bas is washable. During days of heavy rain, the bag can fit in a plastic shopping bag, contents and all.This is a very useful bag to have."
2,Maxam canvas bag - you get what you pay for,"In design, the bag is really quite nice and functional. The size is perfect. It just completely falls apart (pun intended) when it comes to material selection and assembly. I washed it ONE time to take some of the stiffness out of the canvas. My wife spent the next 3 hours trying to get it back together again. Now, I don't have the confidence in the bag to take on a trip.In the end, fantastic design was crushed by inferior materials and execution."
1,Not what i thought,"From the reviews here... i was expecting a smaller, wont fit a magazine bag. That is NOT what i got. The thing is more than 14"" wide, and theres not one zipped pocket on there. I feel jipped, and am now on the search for another SMALL bag."
1,A terrible disappointment,"I received this bag today and was disappointed on several levels. The workmanship and quality are mediocre, at best. The fabric is not only too lightweight for bag duty, it's nowhere near the color it should be. Neither khaki nor olive, it's actually a strange, not quite - and nowhere near neutral - chocolate brown. The buttons are large, cheap looking and not in keeping with the style of this bag. I ordered another one at the same time in another color, and when it arrives I'm simply refusing delivery. I see no point in even looking at it. Good shipping time, though."
4,Supernatural beings,"Creepy horror with a dash of gore, so make sure only mature audiences are watching. Action and dark tales merge as legendary supernatural beings in the form of vampires and werewolves battle it out. Not bad, though some parts are just slightly predictable.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
5,Underworld - Evolution (Widescreen Special Edition),"I love this movie, It is an action pacted rollercoaster ride."
2,Disappointed,"I generally like this type of horror story and I very much enjoyed the first one. So I was very disappointed with this movie.The story I thought was fairly weak, the acting, I thought was quite poor. Kate Beckinsale does not do nearly as good a job as she did in the previous one.The special effects are okay. Nothing really brilliant.If I had not liked the first one so much, I probably would not have bothered to see the end of this one."
2,Disappointing,"Compared to the first one OR measured on it's own, this movie was a disappointment. More blood, nudity, violence, swearing, and sex than the first movie, less plot and characterization."
3,"Vampires, werewolves, splatter --","-- and Kate in what looks like a latex cat-suit and corset, except when it comes off. She looks good either way. Don't hold your breath waiting for much more, though.It's a fair monster/action flick, even if it never finds either a premise that makes sense or Newtonian physics (hey guys: ""equal and opposite reaction,"" not just a good idea, it's the law). Maybe you like movies with lots of ineffective gunfire and running around. In that case, this might be a fair way to kill an evening, if you have one that needs killing.//wiredweird"
2,The limit of cinema,"This is not cinema. Is not even a film proper. Is the equivalent of a pitching or brainstorm reunion on the screen. Ideas for set-pieces are thrown at light-speed, none of them impressive or intelligent. The prologue is nice and effects overall are good, but is all very (VERY) irrelevant. Nothing is done of vampires or werewolfes, in a movie about vampires and werewolfes! There is a couple of shots of naked Kate Beckinsale. Cool. That's it."
2,Never Received,"I saw this movie in the Theater and that is why I purchased it from Amazon.com. The movie itself is great, however, I never received my movie. It is almost impossible to contact Amazon.com without clicking on link to link under their supposed ""help"" section. My e-mails have been avoided and Amazon.com has already taken my money. The tracking information is incomplete and the ""Phone Me"" section does not work at Amazon.com. I have sent two e-mails already for two days and no response, no movie. Buyers beware, Amazon.com is no longer reliable."
2,"A bit better than ""Underworld"" but bad writing destroys it","This movie is a bit better than ""Underworld"" with its camerawork and average action scenes but bad writing destroys it, the pacing is too slow and its main character (Selene) can't shoot well. This film isn't as bad as the first movie, its more mediocre than awful. 5/10"
4,Underworld Entertainment,"The great special effects in this DVD make for some very entertaining viewing. The costumes are LA OK. Vampire and werewolf (lycans) special effects...make up for some of the costumes.Tony Curran, as Marcus, delivered a formidable performance, and so did Derick Jacobi, as the father of all vampires. The action sequences are very fine...making up for the rudimentary plot. This is very entertaining in a high action vampire/werewolf kind of way."
3,Weakest movie in the series.,Perhaps the weakest movie in the series. Acting and script lacked from the original. Although informative in the series it seemed rushed together. I thought that the acting of Scott Speedman was lacking and he didn't put much effort into this film. Still worth watching if you are a fan of the series.
5,Underworld 2 Outstanding,"I thought the first one was good, but when my wife and I went to see the second one, I thought it was really better than the first. My wife thought it was a little more bloodier than the first. I talked to everyone I knew about the movie and said they needed to go and see it. I give Underworld: Evolution two thumbs up. I recommend anyone to go and see this spectacular movie."
3,Decent Flick!,At Least the Werewolves looked like werewolves instead of werecats this time!And the main werewolf at the end was ungodly awesome!
1,"Completely meaningless crap for teens or brainless ""adults""","I've been forced to sit through this a couple times. Absolutely awful, meaningless crap. I was so bored that I think sitting on the couch in complete silence, staring at the wall, would've been more bearable than this."
1,This Movie Is Just Whatever,"Everything in the movie was too dark and I almost fell asleep. You would think for a hybrid Michael would be bigger than he was. Victor's wings were interesting- now you see them, no you don't. Other than that, nothing too spectacular. Just vampires and werewolves. Would've been interesting if Buffy the Vampire Slayer was in it."
2,cliches upon cliches,"Vampires fighting werewolves - how much more cliche-y do you get.The goths were always about special effects, but this movie combines the gothic black with bad taste and commercial exploitation.There is some atrocious scriptwriting in this movie, which appears to have been made solely for special effects. It took me more than half the movie to figure out who the characters were and what they were about.The special effects are cool, but so what? This Wiseman guy - is a Judas who is happy to participate in the degeneration of movie-makin, trivialisation of the narrative and utter contempt for the viewer. Caveat emptor."
3,A so-so sequel,"I really enjoyed the first Underworld and I thought this one tried to be bigger and better. It was bigger, but that doesn't make it better. Still the action is good, and Beckinsale as always is stunning.It's also fun to have some more background on the origins of everything, but if I'm correct there was a minor continuity issue. However I will not discuss that so as to not ruin the movie for anyone. Though it bugged me a little.Overall, a fun movie just not as good as the first."
3,USA viewing,"Ther is nothing wrong with the item, at all. Only, it is not for USA viewing, but, yes, on the computer."
3,Not nearly as good as the first,"I was really excited when I heard this movie was coming out because I enjoyed the first one so much. However, I was fairly dissapointed after watching this movie. I caught myself thinking several times throughout the movie, when's the action going to really ramp up? Losing the attention of your audience in this type of movie isn't a good thing. I much prefer the original."
4,Wait for the uncut extended edition,"I'm anxiously waiting for the uncut extended edition to be released, so I can pair it up with my unrated extended cut of the first film. I hope I don't have to wait too long! In the meantime, I'll give this film 4 stars based on how much I like the original. I want the studio to realize that there are many of us who are jumping to buy the uncut extended version. So perhaps this will be helpful to the studio execs. As for DVD buyers who are contemplating purchasing this first theatrical edition, perhaps they will appreciate the fact that it was worth waiting for the unrated extended cut of the first film."
3,I'll bite,"Did you see the first Underworld? Did you like it? If the answer is ""No,"" then why are reading this in the first place? Basically all one need know about this sequel to Underworld is that its pretty much more of the same, only on a bit grander scale. There's action, blood, untold thousands of rounds of ammo expended, werewolves, vampires, hybrids, action, action, action. Oh, and there's Kate Beckinsale in that skin tight black outfit, so, I'm there. Underworld Evolution is an affable sequel if you dug the first movie: the action is plentiful, the pacing is fast, the visuals are done well, Kate looks great. But, like the original, the film offers little else to sink your teeth into. It's junk food, sure, but who doesn't love a little junk food now and then."
2,"Hopefully, Part III Will be Better...","Nowhere near as good, at least in my opinion, as the original Underworld. Too much gore and a weak plot. Bought this via Video On Demand, but I wish now I had just rented it (lesson learned). One redeeming factor: getting to watch Kate Beckinsale for an hour and a half --almost made the experience worthwhile, but not quite."
4,Nice ending,"After a bit of a whirlwind with the first film, this one tries to build up more of plot. Nevertheless its still very slow in that aspect, but fast paced in the action. Kate is a real charmer in the role, and its nice to see the different spins on lykens. Still looking to appear olde, the film could have benefited from more modernism. Nevertheless a good way to while away one and a half hours or so."
5,Great service,The product came in a very timely manner and in perfect condition. Thank you for the great service!
4,Awesome movie,Awesome movie to watch on blu-ray and a home theather system. I got my bose system hooked up and its amazing.
2,I turned this movie OFF 30 minutes into the movie!!,"Boring! Dull! Lack of character development! Lack of flow! This is what the first 30 minutes seemed like. I couldn't watch anymore even though I was kinda' tryin' to force myself. Pero, no, I don't think it would have been a good movie."
1,Not even close to the original,"Navy Seals meets Van Helsing, this was just a ""BAD SEQUEL"" to a ""GREAT MOVIE""."
4,Entertaining movie; great characters; intermittently dodgy fx,"Despite some of the CGI work and sfx in the truck chase and helicopter scenes being a bit sub-par, Kate Beckinsale's second outing as Selene the vampiress to die for is good entertainment, with a plot that keeps its claws in you. Derek Jacobi looks a bit bemused except when he's being oracular or noble, but Bill Nighy has a good time, and so did I. I'm not a huge fan of Horror movies or Vampire flicks, but this one is a fang or two above the average!"
3,Better than the first one,"I found the first one to be just ""okay"". This one was a bit better, but not by much. It had the cliche hot chick in leather kicking ass and all eyes were on her, but I was more interested in Speedman's character. I think because he was supposed to be so special, that he would have more to do or say in the film. The plot wasn't necessarily what I wanted, but hey."
3,A fun gory action sequal,"I have never seen the first movie and I do not really like vampire movies so I was surprised that I liked this film. The film explains what happend in the first movie in the first 5 min so i kinda understood what I missed, but at times I was lost and had to ask my friend some questions. The movie is enjoyable for thriller or action fans. The movie has lots of gore and is really dark. The story is action packed and dosent stop. The acting is pretty good for an action/thriller movie. Overall I enjoyed this film with all the gore action and scary parts."
1,A turkey ... with fangs,"I really liked the first Underworld ... while not perfect, it developed a compelling and interesting storyline with great visuals, a good cast (ok..Kate Beckingsale) and a narrative platform to develop and extend the series into a compelling franchise. By those standards, Underworld Evolution has got to be considered a flop. It has a confusing backstory that adds nothing to the central characters and instead substitutes infantile fights and violence throughout the length of the movie and Derek Jacobi in one of the sillier and embarassing roles of the year. No extension of the promising storyline from Underworld is developed instead leaving you with the expected .. stay tuned for more! Well those who stayed till the end may have gotten the message but anyone expecting something similar to the original Underworld probably left a long time ago."
5,Was it GOOD!!! or Was I GOOD!!!!! its was AWESOME!! Kate ROCKS and she is HOT!!,"This sequal was Great, the way the forming of the vampires and the lycans was thought of and put in to play was AWESOME!! The actress and the actors that played the roles in the movie, suited thier roles Perfectly.(The casting was Great). Kate (Selene) (hottie)played her role #@!$*#$@## well. So did Scott (Micheal), It is definately a Personall favourite!!The mix of action, Romance, Sci-fi was Good. Why, Why did it have to end? (Little bit short).Overall it gets 6/5 in my books!!Great Film.Kate Beckinsale is HOT!!!,Beautiful, Great Actress.I LOVE KATE!!!!"
2,Dissapointing,"I watched this movie at first hoping it could at least be a descent sequel like it was supposed to be. Not even close. The story goes from moveing fast, to agonizingly slow, and then back to fast. I dont mind a slow movie but changing the pace too much just makes me bored. The special effects are cool, but nothing to get too excited about. If you have seen the first movie then you dont get anything new out of this one. Mostly though, the villans are boring. If I want to see someone who can regenerate from ANY wound in one day then I will watch X-men agian. Don't get me wrong, I liked the first movie, but I feel cheated out of a couple bucks after watching this, so unless you have to see it to make your life complete then you are better off with any other vampire movie."
4,A Bit More Sex and Violence than the First One,"There's a bit more sex and violence in this second in the series about the vampire/werewolf war than the first film. It is a little more unfocused as well as it covers the story of the origin of that centuries long war and eschews story and charecter for action. Still, Kate Beckensale never fails to please, whether she is blasting the Hell out of nocturnal, horrible creatures or having R rated sex wiwth her human/lycan/vampire hybrid lover Michael."
3,good but its not as good as the first one,i think that the first one was much beter done but i do have to give creadit that the action part wher done very well but the story was very weak
2,More action than story,"I really enjoyed the first ""Underworld"", so much that I bought the DVD (I don't purchase too many movies). I read lots of vampire books as it is one of my favorite genres. But I waited until the DVD came out to watch this film (I gave up going to the theaters years ago). I was ferklemped after seeing this film. The great story line that was established in the first film just didn't flow in this installment. At almost the end of the film, I realized Scott Speedman hadn't really talked that much in the film. There is way lots of action and fights. I am all for fights but the fights seemed to be fruitless. When the vamps and lycans fight each other, they still hang in there. Bullet and spear chucking doesn't always kill these guys off. I was let down that more story or alliances were accomplished. I hope that if a 3rd installment is made it goes back to the storyline."
3,Stunningly beautiful!,"Underworld-Evolution is a highly visual action film. Gorgeously art directed with gothic upon gothic scenery, and curious lighting which gave everything a tinge of blue.The acting was very good. I would have loved to see more of Derek Jacobi who gave life to the script--but he only shows up in the last few scenes. Some of the action sequences move too quickly for me plus a little too many CGI effects--sometimes I was not sure what was going on except that lots of squishy fluids were spurting from various hairy body parts!Overall a fun movie to watch--probably would be best to see it on the big screen."
3,A let down,"Though the graphics were good there didn't seem to be much of a plot. The dialog in the movie could have been better by far. You have to watch it a couple of times to catch everything in it, which is all right I don't have a problem with that. Everything just seemed thrown together at the last minute. The first Underworld was by far better than its sequel."
5,"Admittedly, I'm a sucker",";)But really, I have to preface my review with the fact that, although being female and very much prefer the male gender, there is nothing wrong with acknowledging the attractiveness of another woman. I am completely convinced that Kate Beckensale is the hottest chick on the planet.Now, that said, I definitely prefered this installment of the Underworld saga for script-writing reasons. I felt the storyline was more rich and the character interaction drew me in more. Although I feel that many movies have resorted solely to CG to capture a movie-goer's attention (instead of plot), I felt compelled to watch to see the story unfold. It didn't hurt that I felt the movie was gorgeous to boot."
3,Kate Beckinsale in leather 2!,Part 1 never did much for me. About the only good thing I can say about it is that it has Kate Beckinsale in leather. Here she's in leather and I think she gives a better performance. She looks incredibly hot and I like the story more and there's also more action. Her relationship between her Scott Speedman's character develops more as well. I don't know why so many people give this one a low rating and talk about part 1 like it's all that. I had a lot more fun watching this one than I did with the first movie. I like the main villian that has bat wings although it's never really explained how he got like that. We just know that he's a half-breed that's trying to free his very strong werewolf brother from his hidden prison cell.
3,Worth owning,I enjoyed this movie...although not as much as the first Underworld (****). The first movie was wrapped up so nicely that this time around the story seems kinda thin.Flying vampires. Bigger werewolves. Great effects. Great set design. Sexy acting. Its vampire-ific!!
3,Underated.,"I was surprised by Underworld Evolution, as it was a lot better than the first one. With an even better story, improved special effects and an awsome villian UE is a clear improvement from the first Underworld. The critics have underated this movie way too much. I really thought this was a decent attempt at the Werewolf VS Vampire horror flick. It had plenty of action and gore which is the movie's desired intention.Overall I thought this was a good entertaining movie and i'm sure an Underworld 3 will follow."
2,Wait for the DVD,"The battle scenes looked like they were filmed under a strobe light. The plot was boring, and predictable. If I had to watch the old vampire stab another victim with his stupid-looking wing-tips I was sure to walk out.A good movie, but one to watch on DVD."
5,Best movie of 2005 so far...,"Underworld: Evolution is one of the best movies ever. It's 10 times better than the first one, the action has greatly improved, and the gore has literally trippled. Get this movie when it comes out or else you will miss the best movie that will probably come out this year!"
4,"Very Entertaining, Comic-Book Genre Movie","I did not see Underworld until late 2008 because I had suspected that it was a vampire movie rip-off. When I finally did see it, I was pleasantly surprised and immediately purchased Evolution which I found to be equally entertaining. It is a reasonably good script with good acting and technical work and some interesting color effects."
4,Fantastic!!!!!,"Very good movie, just as good as the first. I expect nothing but greatness from Kate Beckensale and she delivers a great performance."
5,Enjoyed it like the others good vampire flick,"Good Vampire vs. Lycon flick, I enjoyed them all pretty much. Story is okay action is great and drama and suspense is in there a bit as well. No name actors did well also at least none of them I really recognize from anything else."
4,Newbie,"I am new to the underworld series. I saw the 1st underworld and liked it and deciced to invest the time to see them all. Underworld Evolution is part 2 in the series and picks up where part 1 leaves off. Without giving away the plot, I will say that it will prepare you for Underworld Awakening."
4,Good horror movie but...,"Underworld Evolution was a good horror movie but... I agree with some of the reviewers the story line was strange to say the least. I enjoy the beginning of the movie, then slow up in middle, but I actually enjoy the ending personally. So for this movie I have to say if your just looking for some mindless entertainment to have during a free evening then pick this movie up and enjoy some good amount of blood and gore, decent story line that sets up the 4th movie in the set Awakening. But to me this is still a good movie worth 4 stars but falls into what I call love it or hate movies."
2,Not as good as the Original,"The sequel, Underworld - Evolution is moderately entertaining but not quite as good as the original."
4,Very entertaining: an excellent sequel,"I'll admit this sequel does throw a lot at you in the beginning that had me somewhat confused, but things become clear as the movie progresses. I really enjoyed the movie as a whole, but the ultimate battles between Selene vs Marcus and Michael vs William could have been a bit more... more something. Even so, this movie is great fun and I look forward to the 3-quel."
4,A good sequal..is the door open for another?,"This was a great sequal to the 2003 underworld. I like how this movie managed to slide in and fill some gaps in the history of the werewolve/vampire saga, the Corvinus family legend is explained, and the father of this all is revealed. I enjoyed the camera work/computer generations melded together into some good fighting seqences. This movie seemed to drag on and was slower to develop than the other one. And the Sex scene was just forced in, not really nessessary. Otherwise, check this movie out. A must have if you liked the first one. I just hope they don't release this as a Extended unrated version like they did with the first one...they wait about a year then boom, suprise, here it is. Hollywood did the same thing with Sin City...money hungry as they are. anyway, check this movie out. I honestly hope their is no sequel, the storyline may get to thin and wreck what these first two movies have for reputation."
2,Utterly Boring,"I haven't seen the first Underworld but I thought the storyline was easy to adapt to especially when you go to watch this film with an Underworld enthusiast. My major concern was the lack of a concrete storyline, haphazard direction, predictability and lack of surprise the film offers. Relax, I'm not the first person who ever watched a film without watching the prequel. I don't know if I should complain on the acting front cause it was decent. I quite liked the villain's character but there was not much this film offered with a thin plot.I'll name two better films, Poseidon and King ArthurUnderworld : Evolution was definitely better than Van Helsing though.Almost nothing about this film is extraordinary or remotely unique"
5,Good press,"well encoded,and surround sound is good.The movie is the same one that was in the theatre"
1,BAD!,"I loved the first Underworld movie. The sequel took everything that I liked about the first, drove a stake in its heart, and left it in the sun to die. There was parts inthe first movie that the second movie totally gets wrong or forgets. Plus, did we really need that stupid sex scene in the middle of the movie. PLEASE!"
3,Underworld-Evolution,The first movie of underworld was much better. Action is okay but the middle is to streched.The hybrid goes down and up your not sure that he is a hero to her.
2,sad,this one did no justice i though that it would have more action itn it. but i still like the movie and the ending.
5,Unbelievably Hot Stuff,"No doubt, Chaz can caress traditional blues standards with the best of them. His song ""Seafood Department Blues"" should come with a warning label that reads: ""Caution, this song contains highly addictive substances and will cause you to listen over and over........."" It is the quintessential ""blues riff"" tune. But the depth of his talent starts where most musicians' know-how ends. ""Don't Shave Your Legs Tonight"" is the beginning of his departure from the traditional; it is raw and unassuming - but its that unafraid approach to everything he does that wins Chaz honors as a real innovator. ""Aint Smellin Too Good"" will make you laugh with the lyrics and rock to the beat. Musical ""outsider"" predecessors like Frank Zappa would have embraced Chaz as a brother. He explores every crevice inside a song, and the outer edges of every thought as each new track unfolds. This CD is unbelievably HOT STUFF!!!!! Five Stars Baby!!"
5,An Imperfect God,"In An Imperfect God, Author Henry Wiencek succeeds in his portrayal of George Washington as soldier, satatesman, planter, and slaveholder. Along with being a biography of Washington, Wiencek also sheds light on the African presence in America from the 17th century to the present. As one reads, one notices the paradox that is the American Revolution, as well as its leader, Washington. We see Washington's views on slavery, from childhood up until his death.The topic of relationships between slave and master is also brought up. These include one between Martha Washington's father-in-law and a slave, one between a mulatto woman and Martha's own father (her half sister), the Sally Hemings and Jefferson case, and even one between Washington himself, and a slave named Venus."
3,Nice try....,Sad attempt to make a death bed conversion wipe out history of silence on such a key issue. His lack of leadership cost America many lives and many great pain. Not to mention America was last of major nations to end slavery.......Thanks but a secret will does not change that.
2,Disjointed & hypothetical,"Clearly the author has an ax to grind. This book is full of ""could have, should have, must have known,"" etc. Very poor scholasticism. The author feels that the Founding Fathers could have manipulated or dictated slavery away. If they had, we would have had a number of states refusing to joint the union and most importantly, we would not have had laws made by the consent of the people governed...exactly what the people were fighting against. Am glad I read a library copy instead of wasting my own money."
4,"Washington's humanity, morality, and slave history.","This is a first-rate piece of history. Washington's life was so big that it is hard to grasp the man for all his deeds. Although it may not have been Wiencek's main purpose to reveal Washington the man through his experiences as a slaveholder, the book does exactly that. The story is well-written, and contains information on black troops in the Continental Army (20% of the force), as well as interesting material on how mixed-race children played a part in blurring the slave-owner distinctions in 18th century Virginia. You will enjoy it."
2,Reviewer,"I found the chapter on West Ford very interesting, but not original. It seems the author based his information from another book, I Cannot Tell a Lie: The True Story of George Washington's African American Descendants. The story did however give some new insights about George and Slavery."
3,I Just Don't Buy It!,"I simply just don't buy Wiencek's argument that Washington was the ultimate emancipator, while he makes several references to Jefferson's slanted racial views on slavery which I feel are not only misrepresented, but untrue. Fact of the matter is that none of these noble and honorable individuals had the courage to do what should have been done. The book does show some insight to a humiliating chapter in American history, I would just like to ask Wiencek a few questions about his opinion."
5,"Lincoln Keller, PI, is a cool dude!","Silent Suspicion was a very good read. No stagnant moments in the story. The plot moves a long at a comfortable pace. If you like mystery, suspense and intrigue, then you will LOVE Meadow's second novel. Private Investigator Lincoln Keller, along with a plethora of secondary characters, work diligently to solve an eight-year old murder that is appears in the beginning of the novel to be a ""never- will-be-solved"" case. But, as a previous reviewer has said, Keller is witty, resourceful and uses both attributes to his best advantage and ""out wits"" those who are intent on keeping the murder in the unsolved case file drawer. If you have never read anything by Meadows, now is the time to start. I can't wait until the next one is available."
2,"Not as funny as it reads, but still cute","As a bit of schlock art, this wins, but it isn't as funny in execution as it reads on paper. Much of it doesn't exactly leap off the disc because some of these renditions take themselves too seriously. A switch of some of the artists to more known or displaced artists would have made this a cool in a I-still-carry-a-lunchbox-to-work kind of way: Roy Clark doing ""What A Wonderful World"" doesn't push out of the paradigm of the in-joke very much, but somebody like Alice Cooper playing it might have.Not that there aren't some jewels here: Devo's ""Ohio"" is a great cover AND a great song, and Don Ho doing Peter Gabriel's ""Shock the Monkey"" fits so perfectly in with what I was expecting out of this record that I can't understand why the executive producer (Cevin Soling) didn't pursue this type of miscasting thorughout.A good idea that doesn't quite live up to the potential of its own shlockiness. Quit being so serious and have more fun with it next time around."
2,"It Sounded Like a Good Idea...,","I bought this to hear Lesley Gore hear 'Dirty Deeds' and now I'm thinking I should have just tried to imagine it in my head. Like the previous comment, there's nothing really unusual about these covers so they don't even have that much of a 'so bad, they're good', or camp value. The covers are pretty unremarkable, bordering on boring. Oh well, live and learn."
4,Jarmusch Sound Track? Surrealism's Musical Love Child?,If Jarmusch had Tarentino's musical love the soundtrack to his movies might sound like this. Requires a knowledge of the public personas of the cover and original performer for full ironic effect.AC/DC -> Leslie GoreCSNY -> DevoNancy Sinatra -> The FixxAnyone -> Ani DeFranco and Jackie ChanOr maybe I've just been transported to the Twilight Zone...
4,My students love it!,I work with a classroom of reluctant readers grades 2-3. This book has created a sensation within my reading groups. The children are eager for the challenges that each page presents and are willing to read and work together to solve each page's mystery. They want to write additional pages and draft their own challenge puzzles.
1,Awful....total waste of money.,Not even close to fitting. I need to type at least 20 words but there is nothing else to say. I am quite experienced with stereo installations and was hoping to use this to avoid spending the extra time making custom enclosures. This was so far from being a correct fit it went right into the garbage. Total waste of my money...thanks Amazon.
3,"Good explanations, o.k. organization","As far as textbooks go, this one is not bad. The explanations are clear and the cases are straightforward. However, the organization could be better. At times, I think it would be better to focus all on one topic, say adjudication, instead of discussing parts of it in one chapter and then continuing the discussion in another chapter.Another good part of this book is that they put the problems before the readings. This way you know what to look for in the cases before you read them. It makes it much easier to prepare for class."
4,What happened to the show?,"It's early 2012 and his new season was supposed to be starting, so what happened since his show is not even listed on A&E;'s website anymore? Is it because of his new show on reelz channel, maybe but last month A&E;'s website said new season first week in January. Well, nonetheless season one was very interesting. He seems to bring the same type of style to law enforcement that he does in his movies. Appears to be a decent, fair cop as well since it seems every day on the news cops are getting into trouble for unnecessary force. If you can't trust the police, who can you trust.Peter J. Miller"
4,Steven Seagal LAWMAN Season One,This is a great series showing you the man (Seagal) as a real life cop. Also an interesting look behind the scenes of the many talents of Steven Seagal and how he helps people in need. A bit slower paced than shows like 'COPS' but very enjoyable.I hope there's a second season of this show.
4,so much fun!!,"This game is great for a 2-4 couples. It could even be a team of girls vs, team of guys. The game divides girls vs. boys and ask each other questions about the opposite sex and then try and guess what the other team said for an answer. We had so much fun and some of the answers were surprizing and hilarious. One of the questions was asking the girls ""your man looks best in a) a business suit, b) his birthday suit c) a wetsite. the answer from both teams was hilarious. Good silly flirty fun. I recommend it for a fun evening with friends 100%!"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this game because I had played it with some friends a few years ago and we had a lot of laughs. It was not made clear to me when I ordered it that it is no longer the same game even though it has the same name and the box looks the same. Originally it was a game for groups of men and women to play together in two teams. Now it is a couple's game. very different, much more limiting, and not as much fun. Originally it was about women and men, now it is about couples. It can only be played with couples. I would not recommend it."
2,Extremely loud,"I bought this blender because of the larger-than-average jar size. This turned out to be its only positive attribute.This is the loudest blender I have ever owned. I kid you not, I generally wear ear plugs while using it. Also, it does a very poor job on ice. I have made frozen margaritas a few times using this blender, and it has always been a battle. I suspect that the shape of the jar is largely responsible.I suggest you look into a higher quality blender with a smaller capacity. It's better to have to make more batches than to be required to ""help"" the blender manually every time."
4,Works great with Vallejo paints,"Having never used a true acrylic thinner before, this was a pleasant surprise... and works far better than just water. Originally I had purchased this to thin my Vallejo Game Color line paints for my airbrush. I've also found this provides similar fantastic results for using brushes as well. Not only does it thin the paints but it also gives me more time using them as the paint in my pallette is drying out slower. All around a good choice. Only complaint would be the lack of some sort of application mechanism included in the top of the bottle. A dropper of some sort would have been useful."
3,"Too little, too late","I love Lee Wiley's singing. That said, of the many of her albums I have collected, this is the one most of us, except the obsessive fans, should pass on.The reason is not her singing, though it is the voice of experience over physiology that all top singers display, no, it is the inane announcements sprinkled throughout the CD, and especially it is the mediocre technical quality of the Boston Storyland rehersal cuts.If the producers of this recording had done their duty, which is to protect listeners from the defects listed above, it might have been worth owning.Save your money and splurge on all her other CD's which are marvelous. She was a genuine American singing talent. Torch singer, jazz singer, blues singer extraordinaire."
2,"wonderfully written, BUT...","I really was saddened when I put this book down. Not because it was over, but because I had to put it down halfway through. I really liked the characters and the plot, the storyline was very interesting, but--possible spoiler here--the author constantly changes the name of the characters in the protagonist's family. Often within the same paragraph. And this became distracting to the point where I just couldn't read any more. I assume it's a literary device--he keeps the first letter, but changes the rest, so ""Allen"", ""Abel"", ""Antigone"" might be refering to the same person. Really, had it not been for this, I probably would have loved this book. But since there are seven main members of the family, it gets tiring very fast."
1,"Phoned in,","""Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom"" was pretty good, along with ""Eastern Standard Tribe"".This book is either an artist taking a risk, or a THC-fueled attempt to squeeze a few bucks from a reputation.I'm unhappy enough to be betting on the latter.Oh, and BTW, I own all three books as hardcovers. I used to trust the guy that much. No longer."
2,An allegory that went nowhere,"Other reviews have great descriptions of the book, so let me add that the reader is asked to accept an odd world that seems an allegory that hinges on a painful struggle between two brothers (Alan, the ""A"" character and Davey, the ""D"" character), and the climax of this tension is ""resolved"" in the most absurd single and unsatisfying sentence I've ever seen. If you're taking the reader somewhere, you have to go there. Very disappointing, somewhat of a waste of time to read."
4,Engrossing and fun to read,"Contrary to some reviewers, I didn't find it difficult read at all. I've never read Joyce, so I can neither confirm nor deny that comparison. It reminds me a bit of Neil Gaiman but with a large helping of Rudy Rucker (at his best) on the side and maybe just a hint of Vonnegut. It reminds of the days when science fiction authors were willing to take more chances with their writing by exploring new conceptual frameworks for story telling rather than just remining the same space opera/cyberpunk/heinlein pastiche over and over again."
4,"Wonderful, if meandering, fantasy","Other than ""fantasy"" or ""horror"" it would be tough to classify this book. Sometimes I feel like the character development is straying wildly into social issues that Doctorow pretty much has to pound on every time he sits down at the computer, but all the way 'round it works.If you allready have a taste for Mr. Doctorows works, this is not one to miss."
4,this must be the place,"Cory Doctorow's ""Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town"" is a magical, beautiful, deeply *weird* allegory for love, family, and fitting in -- which all sounds very normal/coming-of-agey, at least until you remember that this particular coming of age involves parents who are a washing machine and a mountain, respectively.Doctorow -- who also co-edits the completely freaking rad blog BoingBoing (www.boingboing.net) -- is an all-knowing future-head. The soapbox techno-politics that so easily informed ""Eastern Standard Tribe"" feel a little out of place here, with a subplot extolling the virtues of free wifi that sometimes feels like an entirely separate story (or, perhaps, an extended editorial). But, hey, Doctorow is lucid and smart, so it's still thought-provoking and fun to read. So it goes. Looking very forward to whatever he comes up with next..."
5,Literary SF -- not for mere linear readers,"It is not often I read something where I find fresh, new and peculiar all mixed together so skillfully. This is experimental while still being something of a traditional coming-of-age story, creepy and moving, funny and tragic, all in one relatively tight plot.This is not a novel that everyone will like or enjoy since it requires a certain playfulness, and acceptance of quirkiness, to suspend disbelief and follow these characters. The setting is particularly well rendered, but so is the real-life counter-culture, and the extremely odd family of characters.Readers expecting strictly hard SF will probably not get it, but then that is surely not the intended audience. But this is a unique and heart-felt ride on a particularly ingenious and inventive roller coaster for a more literary hip reader."
2,Failed Fantasy,"I really liked Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, and some of Doctorow's short stories, so I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately the plot seesaws between dreamlike fantasy (a mother who is a washing machine?) and the minutiae of WiFi network operating systems. The tone never gels and the characters remain mostly caricatures."
2,Obvious comedy/drama from Bollywood,"**1/2Watching a romantic comedy from Bollywood is a bit like reading a novel written entirely in purple-prose. Whether comical or sentimental, every emotion is ramped up to roof-rattling volume, with the endless song-and-dance sequences serving as parenthetical expressions, and the grating, out-of-control soundtrack adding what is the sonic equivalent of exclamation points along the way.""Main Aur Mrs Kanna"" - a seriocomic tale of a rocky marriage and a third-party friend who tries moving in on the wife - features all the accoutrements listed above and then some, meaning that if this sort of thing is your cup of tea, you might indeed enjoy the experience. If it isn`t, it's probably best to just pass it by."
1,Keep it out of stock - LOUSY!,"Please save yourself some time and skip this film. Salman Khan and his brother need to understand that they cannot act no matter how they try or don't try. He is either over the top, or reduces his dialogue to a whisper thinking that he is sounding serious as an actor. Kareena Kapoor is equally overrated. I wish to God these actors would wake up to the reality that their films are flopping left and right and go back to acting school. Aren't there any acting schools in India that can intervene and save these actors from themselves? This film did not deserve the one star that I checked off."
1,Music of the middle ages,"The video ""Our Musical heritage: Music of the Middle Ages"" is a very old video production. It seem this video was prepared with very low budget. It has poor representation, poor images and poor creativity. It does not present real instruments, so it is not well documentated. It lacks of historical contents, it does not present all the spectrum of medieval music. Spanish Jewish medieval music is not present as well as mozarabic music and or intrumentation. The recording is also very poor. It would be a good idea for film makers to create a well documentated video on this topic. The plastic appearance of the film is so old it jumps on your TV."
5,Very useful,This tool is very useful when I need to add small amounts of juice to recipes and don't want to get out the larger juice squeezer.
4,Bright yellow?,"The product came to me in bright yellow, not the cream color shown. It's not bad, just not what I expected."
5,Ground breaking debut,"This band is very, very cool. I bought the album after catching them at the Jeep Outside World Music Festival (They opened for O.A.R. and Cheryl Crow). All of the tracks are good, and about four are outstanding, particularly ""Tired"" and ""Dance."" Normally new bands struggle to get the mix of songs on an album right. This one hits a home run out of the gate, which encourages me to think that there will be more great albums out of this band in the future."
3,A Pleasant Surprise (Actually 3.5 stars),"I bought this cd after catching ""Who is Me"" on Launchcast and found it to be a pleasant surprise. Not too impressed the first time I listened, it has grown on me and I find myself humming and whistling a lot of the tunes on it now. I believe that this band is still trying to find their groove, because each song on this cd sounds like a different band. The first sounds just like INXS, the last, just like REM and in between tracks are Counting Crows and Pearl Jam. The exception to that - the song where they've found their niche and do themselves justice is the track ""Free"" which is my favorite. His voice is more subdued and they sound more natural and comfortable in this type of song - a great one, by the way, with poignant lyrics. I find myself listening to it more and more and have passed it on to my friends who also enjoy it. Worth a listen."
5,A Must Have for Any Board Director!,"Simply stated, anyone who serves on a board will benefit from reading this insightful and practical guide to the multitude of issues facing owners and directors of privately-owned companies. This book is filled with great examples and useful information in an easy to read format that can help boards perform optimally in taking their organizations to the next level of success. A must read and future reference guide for small business owners, entrepreneurs, and board members."
1,Not the right product,"This lift support is not for the Toyota Solora 2000. I called Monroe and they said that they do not make lift supports for the Toyoto Solora 2000, which happens to be the car I own. My advice, call before you place an order because amazon.com is not showing the right product for lift support."
1,Won't Fit 2003 Toyota Solara Hood,A great price but unfortunately these Hood Lift Support Struts will not fit My 2003 Toyota Solara.The struts are too short for the Solara.They have the ball socket to fit the hood but have no bottom bracket plates.
3,A little confused,"Well, I was excited to get the thickening conditioner that I used years ago but when I got it it didn't smell as strong as I remember. I can't smell the lemon sage scent and I was looking forward to it. The product does the job but doesn't have the scent so I was wondering if the product may be old."
2,Faded really fast.,At the time I owned these pants I was on a tactical team for corrections. I took these pants to a disturbance that was occurring at one of the units. Chemical agents and smoke were everywhere. I was at the unit for about twelve hours straight. If you are not aware for a disturbance twelve hours at a unit is pretty quick. When I got home I washed the pants. When I took them out of the dryer they had faded to a grayish black. These pants that I had worn once looked like I had owned them for a year. Now in contrast I own some 5.11's that I have taken to multiple disturbances and training exercises and they remain black and seem to be fading at a normal rate.
1,Thanks for the insomniac aid.,"Love Poppy, but this book just isn't up to par. How she can make Courtney Love dull, I don't know -- but she seems to suffer from writer's block in this boring biography. A huge disappointment!"
1,I LOVE COURTNEY BUT POPPY BRITE?,The biographer wasn't up to there subject. Where is Crispin Glover when you need him? May Courtney rock on!
2,Kill Rock Stars,"I believe it takes a massive narcissi to be a rock star. Every Hollywood folk (save Eric from Hole) mentioned in this book is a self-destructing ego-maniac fighting for the throne when their and other rock stars' worlds collide. Even poor Frances has an unhealthy ego. It's an endless cycle of abuse partaking on everyone's half. The opening pages reveal that the author, Brite, and the subject are friends and foreshadows the whole one-sidedness of this bleak story. Brite, when intoxicated, even half persuades you that ol' Courtney isn't as bad as she is depicted. This book makes you want to kill every rock star, especially the ones that have ever befriended Courtney. Ugh. Sadly enough, I get off on this trash. It was also a good and fast read, how inaccurate it may be."
4,"Grabbing, a look into the twisted childhood of a GREAT woman","I thought this was an amazing book, at times I was confused by the writing so I didn't know what period she was in at her life in certain sections. I also thought some of the pictures were insigificant, otherwise a super book about a diva."
5,Buy this book!,"This book is incredible! I've read it several times, and i always learn something new that i didn't really notice last time. If you like Hole, if you like Courtney Love, or even if you hate her, BUY this book! Any fan MUST get this, it's really the best thing out, if you want to know what REALLY happened (you know there are a LOT of rumors) then i highly suggest reading this book. It's completely worth your money, and unlike some books, you will want to read it more than once. At the very least, borrow it from the library. It's one of the best books i've ever read...."
4,This is really Courtney's book,"I believe the question of ""objectivity"" is moot concerning this book. It seems pretty certain -- both from media coverage and from reading between the lines of the bio itself -- that Courtney Love was a silent partner in this book. If this is true, Poppy didn't really have the chance to provide objective coverage, as Courtney probably would have cut it! It's a tradeoff...the book loses a certain critical edge, but how else would Poppy have gotten access to Courtney's letters, diaries, etc.? I think it's best to look at _CL:TRS_ as a book Poppy more or less ghostwrote for Courtney Love ... it's not her best work, but it surely made her a lot of money to finance the writing of more great fiction."
2,But is it objective?,"I got the impression that most, if not all, information came from CL which gives it value as source material but doesn't make for a very objective study. The uncritical way Brite repeated Love's story about an ""affair"" with Trent Reznor (which he has steadfastly denied) doesn't strike me as the way to treat a neighbor."
3,More auto than bio,"Reads like Courtney Love either paid to have the book written or else was standing over Poppy Z. Brite and dictating as Brite typed. But a great read if you can get through the sugar-coating. There's some amazing rewriting of history and back-handed compliments apparently straight from Courtney. Worth the read just for the accidental insights. Meanwhile, Melissa Rossi's ""Cournty Love: Queen of Noise"" remains the best read on the subject."
3,paid a buck- read in one sittiing- highly enjoyable,"..if possibly dubious in its accuracy. This was written in 1997, before CL went truly cray-cray. Although, you can see the beginnings of her insanity in reprints of her early internet postings where she begins to ramble and get semi-coherent.Possibly the most unnerving part is the passage where she lies down in Kurt's blood after the suicide (spoiler, sorry).The book seems to try to be fair and balanced and, as CL herself does, acknowledge her dysfunctional aspects. But you get the feeling that it's more one-sided than it really could be."
5,Moving and real.,"This is unquestionably the best book out there on this fascinating woman and her music. Brite doesn't turn away from the ugliness, and the result is a really unflinching but ultimately sympathetic book about Courtney. It's a really fast, fun, good read, too. I'm giving it to everyone I know this Xmas!"
3,It was fun.,"I like Courtney Love, still love Hole's CDs. I enjoyed the read, but took it with about a pound of salt. Poppy Z. Brite should get some kind of award for how much she can kiss Courtney's ass.Fun fluff.The Courtney Bio by Melissa Rossi is better."
2,poor little Courtney,"As much as I admire Poppy Z Brite as an author, I was extremely disappointed with this book!It seemed to be very biased, almost as if Courtney paid her to write it. Yeah, Courtney had a bad childhood(we do live in a nation of victims afterall). She seems to be making excuses for her behavior by blaming it on her parents. Autism?,Acid at 4? doubtfull(coulda happened-i wasnt there).Lets get out the Violins folks. Courtney is another one of that really irritating breed that haunts the punk-rock music scene- The Trust Fund Punk. They have money- they dont have to grow up.Im Glad I got this book out of a dollar bin! I sold it to half price books for 2!"
3,Needed more passion.,"The book was OK. I think it was well written but needed more details. It reflected no sense of what real fans would want to know. I think people want details of CL's thoughts, her relationship with Curt, her feelings about different situations, what Curt was like, and their feelings of the swirl of attention around them. The book needed more information and needed to be written with a passion. No offense to Brite whom I heard is a great fiction author."
3,Fuzzy collage,"Having never read any of Poppy Z. Brite's fiction, I can only hope it is better than the saccharine prose she dishes out in this biography. I though Virginia Andrews had the copyright on the phrase ""their eyes met and locked"" (used to describe Courtney and Kurt's bonding moment). I can't help enjoying this book for the insights it gives on Love's larger-than-life personality, but the writing is so sloppy it frequently distracts from the content. Brite often repeats the same point, and in Chapter Twelve there is no clue as to where events are happening. LA, Seattle? She fails to substantiate most of her anecdotes, rarely quotes friends and relies a lot on clippings from magazines and newspapers. The whole thing comes off as a fuzzy collage. Maybe Poppy should lay off the pot next time she attempts factual writing..."
2,BORING!,"Melissa Rossi's book was more timely & interesting. It seemed as if Ms.Brite didn't want to offend Courtney Love, so she wrote a fairly tame book. This book is okay, if you haven't read Melissa's book first..."
2,"Disappointingly sketchy ""biography""","This book contains surprisingly little information about any of its subjects (I learned much more about Rozz Rezabek from the movie ""Kurt and Courtney"", which provides an interesting counterpoint to this view of Courtney's seeming to be able to do no wrong.), but considering that its main subject definitely has at least one type of personality disorder, and seems to be almost impossible to communicate with on a coherent level, I was not surprised! The pictures included are of very poor quality, also, but as we said, don't know that the author was totally to blame for this. (I was wondering why Poppy Z. Brite did not interview Kurt's aunt, as she was very helpful in the making of ""K & C"", and provided a loving, happy point of view regarding Kurt's childhood, introduction to music, etc.)"
4,Good scrubbing sponge,"I like the product, is just the right amount of scrubbing power without being overly-abrasive. It is a good sized srubbing sponge and holds body wash well."
4,Creepy and realistic!,"This little book from Dover Publications contains ten realistic crawlies. Especially nice for Halloween, but fun all year long, a neat little gift for the budding entomologist. The insects featured are a ladybug, a house fly, a bumblebee, a green darner, an elephant stag beetle, a praying mantis, a scorpion, a tarantula, a hornet, and a black widow spider sitting in a web."
3,"Not the best, but certainly the Most Popular","This compliation contains almost all of Busta's singles and the tracks that have through the years of Busta Rhymes' turbulent career enjoyed the greatest success. It does not, unfortunately feature the singles off his last album (that was Genesis at the time of the release), which is a bit of a downside to the compilation. Still, to people that are not fans of Busta, but want to get a nice feel of his work, this is a certainly suitable compilation. However, this album can't in any way attract the attention of Busta Rhymes fans, as it features nothing new (also, to fans the legitimacy of the tracklisting will seem doubtable). In conclusion, if you want to get into Busta's music, this is a satisfactory starter."
5,Should be required reading for engaged couples,"I am divorced but one of my married friends gave me this book and said, before you remarry, you should read this book. Is so glad she did and I say it should be given as engagement present and everyone should read it before taking the big step. There would probably be a lot fewer divorces! The author's CREATE approach makes a lot of sense.This book has a lot of questions to ask yourself and your spouse, and suggestions on how to discuss the information with him or her. One thing I liked was that it balances both the male and female points of view. Everyone knows it is difficult for a man to express his feeling and gave concrete suggestions there.I found the case studies especially interesting and could relate to some of them. I don't know whether it could have saved my marriage, but, then again, it might have. The authors are wise that, in the end it says if the book doesn't help (which I think it will,) it is best to go out and get professional help."
3,"Useful, but limited","I just read a sample of the book from my Kindle, but that brief excerpt was enough. This book would probably be better titled, ""how to resuscitate a dieing relationship,"" and marketed to those with relationships already on the decline. Even in that situation, I'd find his writing hard to take. He constantly is trying to sell you on his be-all, end-all acronym, CREATE. Though the relationship examples from his practice were excellent, the analogies were weakly uninspiring."
5,Insightful and relevant,I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it! I read it and I love it. A very interesting read which will definitely change your perspective on your relationships.
1,An abomination,"The sound is the worst, Sills screeches her lungs out. She had no voice for Verdi, this Violetta sounds like a common street-girl instead of a dying courtesan. Shame on her!"
4,As Advertised (Stiff),"They have a good flavor and you get a good number of them. If considering them you should know they are on the harder side. Not harder like they will crack your teeth, but harder like it takes a minute or two to chew each one. Stiff might be a more appropriate description"
5,My favorite licorice,I have been looking for this type of licorice near and far. It is very reminiscent of a licorice that I ate as a child that was circular and dome shaped. I really like it. It is noit too salty for me as some are. Highly recommended by me!
3,good stuff ... brings me back to my dutch herritage ...,i like these ... the drops ... and the coins ... i always get a 'box' of each ... lasts me a while lol ...
2,Too Dry for Me,"I love black licorice, but I have to say, I'll be giving these away. The flavor is fine, but the licorice is very dry. Most of the licorice I enjoy (e.g., Kookaburra) has some natural oils in it."
1,Will not order again,I ordered these for my husband because they were in small packages that he could take with him. He said that they were hard and not very good. I will take his word for it because I don't like licorice at all.
5,Excellent,"Great licorice flavor, firm and not too salty. This product was exactly what I wanted and with several bags they can be opened 1 at a time and enjoyed slowly."
2,"Poor Value, Mostly Fluff","I made this purchase based on good reviews and published excerpts. It was with considerable disappointment that I found that the content, while generally insightful, was appropriate only for the non-professional and VERY scant. I would be surprised if there were 2000 words in all of its 163 pages (not 304 pages as advertised on this site). My evaluation: mostly fluff and vastly overpriced."
3,Subject matter largely out of date,"In addition to containing quite a bit of self-congratulatory back-patting, now, in early 2000, I felt a good bit of the subject matter was out of date. In addition, all of the topics covered are available on Hotwired's Webmonkey site and are covered more comprehensively there. Don't buy this book! Instead, surf the Webmonkey tutorials."
5,An inspirational book of which there are too few!,"Great job Jeff. This book brings a clarity to web design like no other. It makes it very clear that the web isn't just pretty pictures or complex programming or plain blah interfaces. Each solution is unique, a combination of all of the above in varying degrees. A great book that adds legitimacy to the profession of web design!"
3,"Okay, but not great.","I've had this blender for about 10 years. It was a gift. I can't believe it's still working. It's very noisy and does NOT crush ice as it claims. It smells like the motor is burning all the time and really grinds loudly, but it keeps on running. The picture and description show a glass pitcher, but the one I have is plastic. I wouldn't say it gets heavy usage. I've gone months without using it, then used it daily for periods of time. Like I said, it's not the greatest, but it works. Okay for light duty blending, but I'd rather spend a little more money and get a blender that really does crush ice so I could have frosty smoothies, but it blends the fruit acceptably."
1,Argh! This is a rotten blender!,"This blender died after 4 months of light use. I never asked it to crush ice or do anything really strenuous. I only used it to blend smoothies and tofu desserts - so the toughest thing it ever had to handle was a couple of half-frozen berries. After two months the motor started to have that burned smell when I used it. After three months the plastic bottom part of the canister started to crack. At four months, the motor started making funny noises, it smelled terrible, and the crack on the canister widened so that liquid started to spill out when in use. All in all, this blender was a total waste of money and ended up in the trash. I will NEVER buy a Hamilton Beach product again."
1,Same burning smell...,"This blender has been emitting a motor-burning smell since the day I got it. I thought it would go away, but it has only gotten worse. Definitely does not do what it says it does, all speeds perform the same. What a waste of money!!"
3,"Good, but short term life","I received this blender three years ago. I used the blender on a regular basis to crush ice, blend smoothies, and mix drinks. I was pleased with the performance. After about a year of use, I started noticing burning smells from the motor. The smells continued along with smoke. Finally, the motor burned out after three years of use. Given the price, I got my money's worth. I would buy this product again. I believe this blender performs as a high end product, but not does not have the same shelf life."
3,Three Years Before Motor Burned Out,"Like another reviewer, I got about three years use before the motor burned out. However, I did use it almost every day/seven times a week - so it got used about 1000 times before it bit the dust. I don't feel that was too unreasonable considering the price - and considering that Hamilton Beach commercial blenders cost $300-$600."
2,Disappointing,"I have read the first of Julius' books, ""Rapid Math Tricks and Tips"", and found it very interesting. Therefore, I eagerly bought this sequel. But as I started reading, I found it very disappointing. The ""tricks"" are far from as good as the ones in the first book. You can hardly call them tricks at all! I got the feeling that after a successful first book, he had to write a second one. And having told all the good tricks in the first book, he had to come up with something to write in this. And what he came up with is not very exciting.My recommendation is to buy the first book, and not this."
4,H R Giger,"These weren't exactly what i was expecting, i bought them as a gift tho- not for me, but they are amazing in their detail of his artwork. Its hard to put so much detail into something so small, so i was interested in how they would look. They're larger than most tarot cards i've seen in the past, which is good. Overall, these were a good purchase, much more expensive than i would've hoped but they came from the seller in quick time and good quality."
4,Question to H.R. Giger Tarot,"I think its a good book but a little difficult. One thing i cant unterstand with the cards. I have two answers for each card. The first under the word woman and the other discribtion with ""REVERSE"". When did I use the Reverse? Please give me an answer so I can use this book and the cards. Many greetings and thanks in advance."
4,Worked well for me!,"This has been a great food processor for me! I bought model #70600 in about 1995 and have been very happy with it. It's still kicking. (I really think model 70600 is the earlier version of this 70700. My 70600 looks exactly like this down to the buttons on the top and the blades.) I use it to slice, grate, and puree. I used it just last week to grate sweet potatoes. I've used it for pizza dough. I haven't had any problems leaving it running (although I haven't tried running it for extended periods with really thick items like bread dough). It may not be the best food processor out there but it gets the job done and is much cheaper than the others. It has helped me make easy work of all my veggie recipes that require a lot of chopping of a lot of vegetables. Plus, after 8 years I just called their customer service and they're sending me a replacement ""disc shaft"" for free as a courtesy. (I accidentally chewed mine up in the garbage disposal.)"
4,Well Written,"From the beginning I needed to know what was going to happen. This story had me turning the pages dieing to know if Jasmyn had the bug! It just goes to show it is a small world, and you never know who knows who. Big up's to Q~Boro on the editing, I found minimal mistakes, and I literally mean like one or two here and there. Q~Boro, keep those hot books coming!"
4,Lessones Learned The Hard Way,"This book wasn't exactly a page turner, but I did enjoy the read. Jasmyn wasn't exactly my favorite character, but by the end of the book I felt bad for her and was happy for her transition and new look on life. This is definitely a book for a younger generation, since they are all running rampant like there's no tomorrow. I can honestly say that this story was a good example of ""what you put out there you get back ten fold."""
5,Wow...really good,Good! I relate this to First Semester by Cecil Ross...I have this book and read it again the other week. Still good as ever and real believable. This is how it goes down at college and unfortunately the outcomes are the same as well.
3,What about shame?,"In this book, I found myself just reading and not really being into the story. To me, the book was lack luster. Maybe if we would have found out that she had HIV at the end of the book instead of the beginning it may have been better. But since we already knew she had HIV, I thought the blast from the past was useless since we never found out who gave her the virus. Jasmyn was reckless and it took her a long time to find the love she needed, but by then it was too late. The ending was okay, but overall the story had no real spark."
1,Don't do it!,"The cover claims the author is the world's #1 NT authority, and that's just the beginning. The biggest challenge with this book is getting past the author's ego and the hokey writing style. Things like ""Don't procrastinate--stay up to date"", ""Return to Sender--No Longer at This Address"", etc. The book is written in a conversational style that is not only distracting but increasingly irritating. There is a lot of ground covered in the book and while it can be used for a cross-reference, or as a doorstop, that's about it. I will be buying another book to learn TCP/IP by a more mature author."
1,Dated and dreadful,"Looking through an online version of this book, I was astonished by how outdated it was--but then, it was published five years ago. Lots of references to Microsoft vaporware like Enhanced Directory Services (DS), not to mention plenty about gopher and WAIS and other obsolete stuff that's pretty irrelevant now.Presumably, there's a more up-to-date book available from these folks, but I truly can't understand how this book has so many fans."
2,I did not like it at all.,It is a bad immitation of the great George Brassens. It is slow and his enthusiasmn is missing. First time I sent a purchess back to amazon.
4,Great looking figure.. But has a nasty smell...,This is a really nice looking Spawn Clown figure he has a great paint job and looks very nice sitting on top of the base. He also comes with a small card with a holder for the card. The only thing that i didnt like about this figure that when i opened the clown it had a very nasty smell to it. it seems that all of the spawn 27 figure's have a nasty smell to them but aftter putting him outside for a bit he does not small anywhere as bad as he did. Over all its a good figure.. If your looking to keep it in the pack you dont have to worry about the smell if you open it just let it sit outside for awhile.
3,Not as Described,"I must be in the minority according to the rest of the reviews but I was disappointed in this item. If you are roasting a chicken the wings and legs burn long before it is cooked if they touch the sides and it is nearly impossible not to. It was also advertised as having a nonstick interior and I have had nothing but problems trying to clean this appliance. Everything sticks to it no matter what I use, Pam, oil ect. It cooks well and doesn't burn on the bottom but I would have purchased a different item if I had known how this one actually performed."
5,Simply Stunning,This CD is all that I would expect from Dan Fogelberg. He always gives us his best. I think he's outdone himself with this one.
5,A Medieval Christmas,"I have been a an of Dan Fogelberg since the beginning. He never ceases to amaze me. With his new release,First Christmas Morning, he has combined great instrmentals along with vocal performances providing thelistener with a very unique and different Christmas CD. The music is a combination of Medieval and contemporary styles.It works beaufifully. The standouts are of course the instrumentals, Winterskol, Feast of Fools (my favorite), Snowfall, and Yule Dance.He uses both accoustic instruments well as electric to provide the listener with a warm and emotional music experience. If you are lookingfor that special Christmas CD that offers a little bit of magic and is different than most, this is the one to buy.Once agan, Dan Fogelberg has proven what a tremendous and talented artist he is."
5,Dan Fogelberg Christmas CD,I really enjoyed this Christmas CD. Not real crazy that Amazon took over 3 weeks to get it to me but once I did recieve it was nice to hear some of Dan's Celtic flare he showed in this traditional Christmas CD.....
5,First Christmas Morning-Dan Fogelberg,"I was unaware of this work until i saw it at AMAZON. Thank you!Dan is the closest thing to a living Mozart or Beethoven we havetoday(in the pop music feild) He is an absolute professional andplays 14 different instruments,produces,arrainges all is work.This workis excellent,as is all his music. It consists of some old European15th,16th century standards(little known in U.S.) and original musiche wrote.Everything is top of the line and perfect for the perhapsmore sophisticated connoiseur of fine music.Huge fan Dan,Wish youa speedy recovery."
5,"If you only buy 1 XMAS CD this year, this should be it!","This is an absolutely beautiful album. Dan's vocals and the wonderful arrangements make it a pure pleasure.Once again, Dan Fogelberg provides us with proof that he is one of the most under-rated artists of our time."
5,A continual favorite,"I came across the album four years ago. Since then it has become my perennial favorite Christmas album. Everyone that I have encouraged to listen to it has also loved it.The music is different, beautiful and glorfying to our Savior. This is not your run-of-the-mill Christmas album. I can only hope to find more Christmas music in this vein."
2,Poor choices,"I have been a long time Fogelberg fan but the opening song on ""The First Christmas Morning"" was a bust and poorly done. It isn't even Dan singing. The bells are really annoying also. Secondly. O' Tannenbaum is the worst recording I have ever heard, because the recording level is cut in half and sounds like it was produced in a garage without professional equipment. An awful track to say the least. Some of Dan's original compositions really shine in this album. But artistically I think some bad choices were made on the material included on this album that should have been caught by others involved in making it. I expected much more from such a talented artist as Fogelberg. The above mentioned tracks really distract from the album as a whole and I encourage others to listen to this particular album from a friend before you make a choice. Try before you by!"
2,Expected More,"Let me make clear that I am a huge fan of Fogelberg's. I gave my wife a copy of Innocent Age on her birthday when we'd only been dating for 2 weeks. He is masterly on Innocent Age, Phoenix, and all older albums. His bluegrass High Country Snows gets some of the heaviest play of any cd's I own. But, this cd lacks. In a simple phrase, Dan takes himself way too seriously (O Tannenbaum?). I enjoy acoustic guitar pieces more than any other form of music, but found myself listening to Winterskol for about a minute and zipping on to the next track. Sorry Dan. You could have offered more skillful (and still peaceful) guitar work."
2,I expected more from Dan.,"After giving it one really good listening, and trying hard to keep an open mind, I must say I am really let down after hearing this CD. I have been a Fogelberg fan since the 70's and have seen him perform numerous times. Never have I been so let down as I am after hearing First Christmas Morning.It sounds like he's trying ""too hard"" to sing and I have to agree that several songs sound too similar to previous work. His creative talent as a musician/singer is lacking and it shows in this CD.Not recommended for the die-hard Dan Fogelberg fan. Sorry Dan!"
3,Not as good as I expected based on other reviews,"I have also been a big Dan Fogelberg fan for many years. I wish he could again produce acoustic guitar based albums like Phoenix, Captured Angel, Souvenirs, etc, but those days may be gone.This recording has several good songs but nothing spectacular. I like ""At Christmastime"", ""I Saw Three Ships"", and ""Snowfall"".The ""Bell Fantasy / Hark the Herald Angels Sing"" is a poor start to the CD. The bells are overdone. I just skip over it. I agree with 'Disappointeed Fan from Georgia' - that there could have been a better lead in to ""At Christmastime"".I still recommend the CD. It is a good alternative to recent 'new' Christmas releases from other artists."
2,Not bad for a Christmas album I suppose,"If every song had been of the quality of In the Bleak Midwinter, I would have given this 5 stars. That song is done beautifully, no argument. In fact it has an almost eerie quality to it, creating an atmosphere all it's own. I've never heard it done so well. One other track is almost as good, but then there's the rest. There are too many of those bland instrumental pieces that we're all too familiar with from No Resemblance Whatsoever. There's no life in them. One of the major disappointments for me is the ""formality"" with which Dan sings and plays much of this music. He's started to do funny things with vowels, like an English choir boy and it just doesn't sound right. Time's running out for Dan. I despair of getting another nicely recorded acoustic album that shows off his two great talents: his voice and his guitar. This album is a comparitive waste of time."

3,Japanese audio only,"The box for this claims Japanese and English Stereo audio. The actual disks have only a Japanese audio track with English subtitles.I purchased this locally instead of through Amazon, and plan to return it unwatched. I do watch Japanese audio anime with subtitles, but not when they make such a major mistake in packaging."
2,Case for HTC X7501/ X7510,"Material + Worksmanship is excellent. No complains.Price is reasonable. Has place to pass thru belt.Perfect. The major drawback : The HTC just fits perfectly into the slot but does not go down inside enough. As a result the magnetic button on the flap does not reach its other part successfully. Therefore it is uncomfortable to know all the time that the flap is open and the HTC might fall off or come out any moment.One thing I am not sure of is , if the magnetic parts on HTC phone if they are creating repulsive or nullifying the magetic power of the flap hardware on our case...Now I have bought it and have no choice but going to keep it and learn to live with it."
1,don't buy this one--save your money for something else,"i heard the DJ Sammy version of Heaven first and i loved it (i still love it). I just heard this Eyra Gail version and she can hardly sing at all! and for some odd reason, Eyra Gail's version has the EXACT SAME techno sounds as the version by DJ Sammy! it doesn't seem like a coincidense to me. it kinda seems like someone copied off of someone else...this whole CD is very strange with her voice everywhere. i think the DJ Sammy's Heaven is 1000 TIMES BETTER than Eyra Gail. i would not recommend this item at all; buy DJ Sammy's CD and singles instead. i'd give this CD 0 stars out of 5 if it was possible!"
3,Not what i expected,"I really like the song heaven although it is originally by DJ Sammy, at least the dance version is. But this seems to be the best song on the cd. the cover of the flame which is probably the next single is pretty good too. As for the rest of the cd well it is fun dance pop but not what i expected. I really was looking for that sound from Dj Sammy, but since she redid it i guess that sound is not hers i would have to pick up the dj sammy cd for that sound. this cd is purely regular pop dance but not too much effort put into it. Seems like the album was done in a rush to be put out before the single totally fades. Overall not that bad not that good."
5,One AMAZING Album!!! A MUST!!!,"I first saw Justin Curtis playing with his band in his record store here in Seattle and thought ""Wow, where did this guy come from and why isn't he totally famous?!"" So I bought this CD right then and there. This CD is a must have for anyone. Justin's voice is pure molasses (Johny Cash meets Elvis), his songs are catchy and very infectious. His lyrics tell stories that transport you to a classic country day-dream. ""Ride Into The Night"" is an instant country classic (alla ""Ghost Riders in the Sky""). ""I Wanna Rob Trains"" is quirky and fun. ""Like a Cadillac"" and ""Cadillac Girl"" provide smooth driving (pun intended) rockabilly rhythms with some great hooks while ""Scarlett Jane"" and ""For The Dreamers"" serve up delicious country/pop and give keen insight into the heart and soul of this spellbinding artist. There are no weak spots anywhere on this CD. I love this album!!!"
3,Just Didn't Fit,We received the light but unfortunately it did not fit in the area we need. It was too small!
1,Not worth it,"I purchased 2 of these lights and had them professionally installed. The one on the front of the house has done fine, no problems. The one on the back of the house has a faulty seal and blew the bulb, it then filled with water which froze over the winter, by the time we could safely remove the shatter bulb it was spring and of course it rained and refilled the light again. It's really hit or miss with these guys and I am inclined to purchase a more weather-tight, proven item. Saving money does not save aggravation."
2,Some Facts - Mostly Conservative Business Viewpoint,"Once you get over the fact that the author does not like liberals - you actually do learn something from his many examples. If you know nothing about the financial system of our country, you won't be that much more educated after reading this book - but you will at least be familiar with the terminology.Franks' insistence that we must leave the rich to get as rich as they please or else we'll all be poor - is hard to swallow. He does makes some good points and certainly is correct on the flow of currency - but to blame the minimum wage hikes for keeping poor people poor is a lot like believing that millionaires only make money so they can keep us all working."
4,Good little primer on Economic matters,"This book is just a little bit dated because it was written before the most recent economic downturn. But it remains a good first book on economics for people who do not know much about the subject. Franks covers all the major items in macroeconomics. Monetary policy, fiscal policy, the various schools of economic thought, and even a little bit of history.Furthermore he does this in a humorous style, no boring graphs and formulas, instead a dry sense of humor.Recommended."
1,product that was sold,I understand that this item was used and I understand that there is no guarantee on what you buy when you purchase online. But I think that if your going to charge $79.00 for a book that is used that you should tell the buyer that there is writing in the book I am very dissatisfied with the book that I have received and I will not purchase anymore
1,Spelling Demons,"The book that I purchased ""Spelling Demons"" was written all over on. It didn't help me at all. Had to purchase a new one."
1,Most Expensive Primer in the World,"Unless you are a grade school teacher in desperate need of a workbook, or are an ESL student -- be forewarned! I'm certain the information inside this text is excellent, but come on people. $100 to learn the difference between it's and its, which you should have learned in grammar school?! Not saying the content isn't good -- it's fine. It's the cost that is galling. This was a required text for me as a court reporting student, and I found the cost reprehensible."
3,Boring ballet but well performed,The good: well performed with high video and audio quality. Nice costumes. Laurent Hilaire is excellent and a pleasure to watch.The bad: Minkus is at best a second rate composer. This is a long boring ballet.
2,too long and too boring,"I bought the ballet because of the Kingdom of the Shades part that I had seen on You Tube. This is a very attractive sequence of music, rather like the second act of Giselle, and I thought perhaps the whole ballet was as good. It was not. The entire first act is full of banal music and pointlessly hyperactive dancing that really hasn't much to recommend it. And I fear as a result my dislike even spread to the Kingdom of the Shades portion. There, as the women lift their legs periodically I could not help but think of dogs and trees."
3,Unable to roam,"I presently own a 900DSS and a 2.4DSS which allow me to walk to my mailbox and around the garden (several hundred yards). I figured the 5.8DSS would give me even more range. Not so! I can go about 80ft, from my workshop to my back door, before losing the signal. I located and returned the unit to the manufacturer and received a replacement - which performed no better. It's an attractive phone, has good features and clarity - but not range, which is important to me."
4,GE 5.8 GHz cordless phone,The only thing that prevents me from giving this phone a 5 star rating is the battery. Received the phone for Christmas and charged it for 24 hrs. The manuel said 16 hrs. I had to charge it again today (28th). The headset feature is great. Any standard 2.5mm headset will work. The functions are easy to use. Overall a great phone.
1,Worst phone ever made,"This has to be the worst phone ever made. After using it for about several months, it stopped working with the word ""Searching"" now constantly showing on the display. What it may be searching for, one may never know. Thinking that maybe the battery was bad, I bought a new battery. This made absolutely no difference. Occassionally it will ""find"" itself, but will invariably drop the signal midway thru a converssation, or have such very poor reception you can't hear the person on the other end - or they can't hear you and hang up. DO NOT BUY this phone - unless you like wasting your money."
2,Cheap phone not even worth 25$,"I am was very disaapointed with this phone. It has several serious flaws that make the phone pretty useless. 1) Battery lasts for about 20 mins talk time. 2) loss of signal (SEARCHING...) even thought the phone is less than 10 feet from the base. 3) Really annoyingly loud ringer, and YOU CAN NOT CHANGE THE RINGER or the volume! Needless to say I'm looking for a new phone :)"
2,not impressed with 5.8 ghz,"For two weeks I tried to really like this phone! It's handsome, but that's about it.I have a Sony 900 mhz. and love it as it has NO interference problems whatsoever, but wanted a phone with caller id capabilites. So I thought I would try the latest technology.Tried a 2.3 ghz and took that back as it had terrible interference. I read that 5.8 was a lot better, NO....First, the volume would fade in and out and there is an annoying background sound between a person pausing on the other end.I do not see any improvement with phone clarity with either the 2.3 or 5.8.I will stick with my Sony 900mhz!! (Of course, Sony doesn't make phones anymore!)"
5,Are you kidding me!!!!???,"$29 US Dollars and this awesome sub enclosure can be yours! Its built well, is very solid and makes nice bass! I previously had my subwoofer in an enclosure that was too small... The Scosche made lower bass and gave the sub nice definition. Remember to get the appropriate size enclosure to get the most out of your subwoofer!Great Product!"
5,Very impressed,"From the 3/4 inch MDF, to the sealed edges, to the springed wired connections, you would be hard pressed to build this box cheaper than $29.99. The only gripe I have is that I wish they would have lowered the speaker connections so if you wanted to, you could attach your amp to the back. But other than that, this box was built extremely well."
5,Great box!! Wrong dimensions,"This is a great sub box. The only thing is the dimensions in the product description is not correct for this box, which was great for me. After I bought this I thought it was going to be too tall to fit under the cover in the back of my hatch back; but the box is actually sized 16"" tall 17"" wide 14"" and 10"" deep (the top is slimmer because the back is slanted). I hope this helps. I think the dimensions in the description may be for the cardboard box that this thing is shipped in.This box sounds great, I have an Alpine Type E in it and the set up is great and looks awesome in the back of my car. I have worked as a professional car audio installer for years, and this box is well constructed has great options (thick MDF, good looking carpet, batting, 16 gauge speaker wire, all the sub mounting screws). If you are looking for a good quality simple sealed box for a 12"" sub; BUY THIS BOX!!"
3,Decent box,"The box looked solid and felt solid from the outside, but when I installed my subwoofer, the sides were flexing and air was leaking. I removed all of the cheap insulation that was stapled inside and noticed that the caulk and glue was dried out, which was causing a great deal of air to leak. This made the subwoofer sound awful. I had to re-caulk the entire box and put at least 2 screws in each side just be safe. I am installing the subwoofer again today, so hopefully the new caulk works and it'll sound amazing."
4,You get what you pay for,"1.25cu ft just doesn't cut it. I mean the quality is great. 3/4 mdf is thick. It will last you a long time. Also the carpeting is awesome. Mine came with 8 screws, so if your sub requires more, you might wanna buy different screws so that they all match. I put a 12inch JL Audio W6 in and it fits well. It just doesn't sound that well. I wish scosche would sell bigger boxes. This is not for competition subs. But still a great box for any regular sub you wanna put it there. Plus the fact that it's sealed just makes it all the better."
5,Sad to see it go so quickly,"First of all: I was really looking forward to having many seasons of this show. I really liked it, it was so funny. They had a great cast, which is a very important key in having in a series. My favorite characters are hard to choose from cause I loved them all. And 2ndly was upset to hear that Whitney is replacing it. Never heard of it. Thanks for not letting Animal Practice have a chance to develop. Will definitely buy the only season and wear it out watching it over and over again."
4,Great New Show,I love this whole premise and look forward to seeing it develop as the actors settle into the characters beyond mere quirkiness.
2,disapointed,"Sat down to watch this show that looked absolutely adorable, with my family, and quickly realized this was not a family show. It was full of sexual content and eventually I decided it was too inappropriate for my 9 yr old, and it made me too uncomfortable to watch with my 14 yr old. So sad. We were looking forward to watching the season together."
4,love Justin Kirk! monkeys rule,I really love Justin Kirk in weeds and a few other actors are good but I detect a bit of racism and sexism in the writing which I'm hoping it will not rely on too heavily as I'd like those minds taken out of my comedy! hope this show keeps it funny and smart not romantic and stupid :P
4,Looove it!!,This little gadget is wonderful. I have used it nearly ten times in the past two weeks since it arrived. It makes gorgeous fluffy and delicious waffles. The recipe book is good. I like the weekend waffle recipe best. Sprinkling brown sugar on the batter made a mess of the machine but did taste good. I havent tried the other recipes in the book but the machine does its job well. One of the legs did come unglued (as one of the other reviewers noticed too) and so far I've just pushed it back in place.
5,Easy to use!!!,Makes nice fluffy waffles and we have blueberry waffles quite freq and I even freeze them sometimes.Cleanup is a breeze esp if you use Pam or the like.
4,Makes good waffles,"Bought this one to replace a Farberware that broke. Works pretty well. The flipping makes a difference. I'd prefer it if it made round waffles, but overall I'm pretty satisfied."
4,Remember your Pam spray!,"This waffle baker makes great waffles, but I found that I had to spray it with Pam nonstick spray before I added the waffle batter to the iron. Otherwise, the waffle stuck to the baker, making a big mess. It is easy to use and appears well built. I recommend it."
4,Works Great!,"For the money, you can't beat it. Easy to use, makes great waffles. Cleaning is a little awkward, but it's a waffle iron. Would probably buy another one."
3,An Okay Product for the Price,"The item is okay considering the price. If your on a budget and want something that gets the job done, then this works. It is smaller then I expected it to be and the rotating part is simply just turning the whole waffle maker over.. If you have a higher budget, buy one of the makers where it actually rotates the waffles.. if you are on a budet, buy this one... the waffles do taste good in the end result."
4,I love waffles,"This item is easy to use, makes great waffles but is hard to clean. I recommend this item for anyone who likes freshly made waffles. You can't beat the price."
5,Great Waffle Iron,"I love the waffle iron. I previously had waffle irons with removable grids and had trouble with the oil/batter running under the grids and creating a mess. This one has non-removable grids, which work fine. I lightly oiled the grids the first time I used it, and have not had to again. I never wash the grids - just wipe them off and the waffles pop out fine. I set a timer for 5 and a half minutes and they come out perfectly every time. The only thing I don't like so much is the shape of the waffles. Round would fit on a plate a little better, but that's about it. I've been using the iron every Saturday morning for about 9 months and am very happy with it. A great purchase."
1,I threw mine away after a few uses! Keep Shopping.,"I carefully read reviews on amazon for days before deciding on the F&F. Expectations were high. Right away, I hated this iron. I tried to like it, but my waffles would stick terribly in spite of my Pam spray. The iron gets so hot that it fills the kitchen full of nasty stinky smoke. After several ruined breakfasts, I gave up. Now the search continues. Will I ever find the right iron?"
2,Waffles come out hard,"I followed the instructions on how to correctly use this waffle iron, but my waffles come out stiff every time. It could be that the waffle iron gets too hot - when the waffle is cooked through, the surface is slightly over-cooked. I've been experimenting with the timing and recipes. I have gotten slightly better results, but it's still harder than the waffles I get at the local breakfast place."
5,Waffle Iron,I love the waffle iron I purchased. It was a Christmas gift for my mom and she loved it as well. We have been making tons of waffles ever since.
3,great waffles,this waffle maker exceeds any claim made by the maker of this machine. a great product at a great price.
5,Woot woot waffle house waffles at your house,"yeah this waffle maker is pretty much awesomeall the people who be h8'n on this waffle maker dont no how to make waffles and probley suck at a lot of things other then making wafflesthe only bad thing about this waff maker is that its kinda hard to cleen, but even thats not that bad because i dont care if my waffles taste like previous waffles made in this.heres some directions to use this thing1)plug in2)make waffle batter3)pour batter5)chill6)eat the wafflesyeah thats pretty much it"
2,How strong do you have to be...?,"...to pry this thing open?? I tried at 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes...I started to get worried at 10 minutes and unpluged the unit. Then I pried it open using a knife and proceeded to break a chopstick getting fossilized batter out of the grooves. I needed a toothbrush to get the gunk out. Oh, and it was still steaming at 10 minutes. (The steam was definitely not coming from the waffle!)Then, I tried it again, with a different batter. Same result (mind you, it takes about half an hour to pry everything out). And again, with cooking spray (so much for non-stick!) and again with about five seconds of cooking spray. That did the trick, but the waffle had the texture of a deep-fried cake. Hmmmm...it was tasty though, hence the two stars.Is this supposed to be non-stick or what???"
1,Waffle Iron,"I bought this waffle iron as a Christmas gift for my daughter and her fiance. They said it worked for one waffle, and then ""died"". I expected better from Hamilton Beach."
3,Not great but it works,waffle batter leaks out the side a little when flipped. my waffles have multiple holes and deformities...possibly bc i dont have a measuring cup but i dont think thats the reason....it all tastes the same going down......
4,Light 'n' fluffy waffle maker but won't last,"I bought this for my brother and his wife after reading all the rave reviews and noting the favorable price point (~$20), demanding Sunday waffle breakfasts whenever I came to town. Once we figured out (after 5 trials) that the cooking time should be no more than 3 minutes (unlike the 10min acc to instructions), it didn't disappoint and even healthy 'n' heavy, multigrain waffle batter turned out light and fluffy.I'm told it worked consistently well until a couple months later when used for a much larger and more demanding group of brunchers. My theory (seeing how it cooked unusually fast) is that something fused due to overheating, so I'd suggest a decent cooldown period between batches. Either way it was a great deal for quick, fluffy pancakes - I just bought them another! ;-)"
5,Great choice,"I got tired of paying $8-10 for waffles in New York City restaurants, so I decided to look for a good waffle iron that would satisfy my frequent cravings. I am a big fan of Villaware, which inspired me to first look for their products. I was, however, suprised to learn that the best rated and selling waffle maker on the Amazon was Hamilton Beach Flip 'n Fluff. After reading the reviews, I was persuaded that this was the product I wanted (plus it was a half price of the Villaware equvialent).I got my waffle maker a week ago and I made waffles several times. They were truly big and fluffy, crispy outside and moist inside. The cooking time is only about 3 minutes. I would, however, like to suggest to use cooking spray the first time you use this product. My first two waffles sticked, but after that initial failure, I had no problems. The cleaning is a breeze. This product deserves the highest marks!"
5,Waffles dont get any better than this!,"I dont usually write reviews on Amazon (however I do use them as a valuable research tool) but this product prompted me too because of the terrific waffles it produces. We use a waffle mix Snoqualmie Falls Lodge Pancake and Waffle Mix and the waffles turn out fluffy, crunchy and never stick. For the money this waffle maker is the best you can buy imho. My only complaint is they dont make a 4 banger so if you got a lot of family to feed buy 2 or more like myself. A great product and hats off to Hamilton Beach and Amazon!"
5,Jewish Treasure,One of my favorite posessions! I love everything in this book. It has something for everyone to enjoy. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves anything Jewish.
2,"Looks so cute, but not sturdy","The picture looked cute, the basket even cuter in person - but man is it flimsy. The wood is thin and fragile and I don't expect it to last thru Summer. Already dropped the bike once (it'll happen) and the basket cracked. The straps that came with it - hmmm, one of them was broken so I had to rig it up with velcro. My goal was to find a large basket for trips to the Farmer's market. It is large, but not worthy."
5,Love this Guy,I have had traumland for a few years and I still listen to it almst daily. He has the voice of an angel. Such a powerful and Charismatic preformance. It will not disappoint.
4,Introduction to Tibet,"This book contains 127 well written pages on Tibet. It would be suitable for 6-9th grade. There are pictures included on most pages. Some jump off the page with an almost distracting fluorescent red.It includes information on the geography, history, government, economy, environment, the people, religion and lifestyle, arts and culture, and food, also a few recipes.Problems with China are not overlooked, there is even a bit about the abominable snowman. Some interesting maps are at the end and a timeline of Tibet compared with happenings in the rest of the world. A glossary and information on further information is given along with an index.This book is well done and if you can obtain it for a reasonable price it would be a good addition to a young person's library."
1,"Science good, investment insight bad","Disappointing. I guess this book is one example where the cover says it all; next time I see a book on Biotech investing, I want to see a dollar sign on the jacket.Sure, I got the biotech bit, but where was the insight into investing. Nothing really hit me. I started reading the book not knowing how to invest in biotech; I ended the same way.On a positive note, I did like the writing style."
5,great product at affordable price,Perfectly sized (2-1/2 quart)casserole. Thick walls and the lid allow for this special oven taste. A little bit of water and no oil needed at all. Great product at amazingly low price.
3,Very cute phone,I love how cute the phone is and it seems to work well. Haven't had any problems with static or anything else. What I don't like is that the user interface on the the phone isn't very user friendly. There are some options that I can't even tell what they do because there is no explanation in the instruction manual.Pros:CuteCaller IDCordlessGood sound qualityCons:Bad User InterfaceRingtonesNot enough instructions for all options in manualExpensivve
2,"Simplistic, Bloated Realism-Regurgitate","Competent and unchallenging stories with long conversational asides about the meaning of it all in the now familiar style of ""well written prose."" These read like expanded short stories flushed out to novella length and would have made decent filler in a longer collection. By the first sentence of a scene, the end of the scene can be predicted. It's a sad commentary that a plain book like this only gets published wrapped in inflation and hype filled blurbs."
4,Great for lazy chefs !,There's really not much to say about a product like this. I have no complaints about it. It's a perfect size! It's easy to clean and you can separate it from the base and toss it in the fridge if you want.This is a great product especially for days when you don't really want to cook. You can toss something in when you leave for work and have dinner ready when you come home. What more could you ask for.
2,Not Complete Preparation- MUST use college book FIRST,"The practice tests are great, but the book does not cover concepts like some CLEP books do. You MUST study a college biology textbook in order to pass this. This is ONLY a review, not a complete preparation text. Once you have studied- then this is good to practice taking the test."
1,Rubbish,"A relative asked me to order this book for her.I read a little about it and came to the conclusion that the only possible help this book could give would be a placebo effect. I ordered it thinking a placebo effect is better than nothing.I'm rating this book 1 because the things it suggests are totally bizarre and strange, even my hopeful relative found it a bit too extreme and unhelpful (and you should have seen some of the stuff she was trying).I don't think my relative was doing all the things the book said to, so I can't scientifically say that it doesn't work. I really do believe that there is nothing more than placebo effect involved here, and it makes me angry that people are making money from this."
1,don't buy this book,"Clearly the title is wrong as let's face it, she as did hundreds of her victims, died of cancer after and while receiving ""treatment"" from her."
3,Cancer Cure,"I am not sure I believe everything it says. The book is easily read and understood, but it is the diagnosis that is perplexing me."
4,Thought provoking possibilities...,"You might want to heed Pascal's Wager and read & apply this book and its recommendations. While the debunkers may be right, if they are you've only wasted a few dollars & time. If they're wrong, it's your life. The only way you lose if if she's right & you ignore her."
3,Good Book! Not exhaustive IMO- but Great Start!,"This book is very good and eye opening about items in our environment and everyday life- also with the cleanse/cure and cause of most. It is consistent with all my other research, but I don't believe it is exhaustive. A very good book with Great information!"
5,Cancer tx,Both of my parents died of cancer.Sine I'm a heavy smoker I've decided to quit smoking and have started the green hull black walnut treatment.I even made my own green walnut hull mixture.I will be going on the maintenance program in about 10 days.I hope to beat cancer by living healthier. I will be nicotine free and only smoking herbal plants to wean myself off the nicotine.
2,Not Much,I sent for 5 cancer books. This is is part mumbo jumbo and part pulling at your heart strings. I didn't find it helpful
