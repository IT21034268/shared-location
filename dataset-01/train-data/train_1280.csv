2,"good functions, brittle construction","I bought this for my grandmother, and within the first week she dropped it off the arm of the recliner. From a fall of less than 2 feet onto hardwood, it broke the antenna off, and the reception is terrible, even within 10 feet of the base/charger. May have damaged the microphone or speaker. But before the drop it was great! I recommend keeping the bubble wrap on..."
2,phone,"The phone was challenging to use for my elderly grandmother. It took awhile for the phone to ring when you called someone, hence she always thought she missed dialed. It looks nice but works very slow. I must say that the seller was very helpful with my issues and let me return it with no problems. I would purchase other items from this seller. Thanks"
2,disapointed,When I first got this phone I loved it. After 8 months it pooped out. Battery life is terrible.
4,Great phone,"Great phone for the elderly! Phone has ""big numbers"" and volume settings for the hard of hearing. Also wireless is a plus so you do not have to worry about cords or extensions"
4,Great Product!,Cassette adaptors i have had in the past kept breaking because the cord would get caught and split. I wanted a retractable and this one works great! Love the product!
1,Simply not working,It worked for 1-2 times...then not at all working...simply tries to rotate from 1 side to another. Basically...no good at all..10$ wasted...so sad...
3,Good for what it does.,"Little rattle but its bearable. You have to be careful with the connector at the end of the wire because it's very weak. After dropping my ipod with it still plugged in so many times, it eventually broke."
4,Works great -- love the retractable cord!,"Just as it says on the package, I can play my iPod tunes on my six-speaker car stereo system without installing expensive equipmentNo scratchy noises. The sound is not quite as good as when I play CDs, but it still sounds pretty darn good.I purchased this a month ago, and my dog did give it a little chomp before I snatched it away, and it still works just fine."
1,Did not work on my Hyndai Stereo System,This adapter only read 4 out of all songs on my ipod from my car stereo system on my Moonson Hyndai Sabta Fe 2004. Too bad.
2,you get what you pay for,this unit is great except for the sound quality is a lot less than i thought it would be. the other problem is that when the adapter is cold it has a tendency to skip a lot. i plan on buying the actual attachment for my deck instead of messing around with this.
1,Defective Item,Product was defective. Would not work on two different car cassette players. Amazon quickly adjusted my account and I purchased an adapter from Sony which works perfectly.
2,Not reliable,"Mine does what a lot of the other reviewers stated: it flips back and forth from side to side a few times and then ejects. After trying about ten times, it worked okay for about 5 minutes before flipping and ejecting again. I haven't had the patience to try it since then. I'm hoping it'll just miraculously start working some day.2 stars because I can't bring myself to return it since it was pretty cheap. Then there's the whole hoping-it-starts-working thing."
1,Didn't work for me,"I had a fair amount of trouble with the AVB adapter. The first one I bought didn't work, so I returned it and ordered a new one thinking it might have been defective. But the second one didn't even work, the cassette seemed to 'change sides' while playing which meant that I got intermittent audio. On the other hand, a Belkin adapter I borrowed from a friend worked perfectly."
3,A Contrary Experience,"I bought this item based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews it has received. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. The bass is extremely distorted and completely drowns out the mids and highs. I have to turn the bass all the way down just to get a song to sound normal. Once I get the settings just right it does sound ok...but there is so much work involved every time the song changes that it's just not worth it. I drive a VW Golf, so anyone driving a Golf be warned that this product does not work so well with that particular tape deck."
4,some good/some bad,"ok, so this works GREAT with great sound... . .when it works.It has a habit of not working all the time...... but when it does its fantastic sound. I usually have to eject it 2 or 3 times before it will recognize itself and work.but, worth a try, especially for the price."
5,This cassette adapter is great!!!,"I recently bought an '06 Mazda6 and with a newly installed tape deck, I wanted a high quality cassette adapter that would not give me any problems while I was driving. I previously owned a Sony and Monster cassette adapter. The Sony always was and still is reliable but being how old it is, the sound quality isn't perfect. The Monster was a piece of crap that constantly would be ejected from my old tape deck so I went with the AVB. I'm glad I did. The sound is great, it spins extremely quietly, and the retractable cord is very nifty. I've only had it for maybe 2 weeks but if it keeps working as it has, then I am very satisfied with this product."
1,Noisy mechanism,"I found the tape roller mechanism to be very noisy, and there is a hiss added to the sound input as well. I replaced this unit with the Sony cassette adapter, and haven't had these problems."
2,Low quality sound,"Retractable cable is a good feature for use, but the sound quality is not good enough. You may hear additional noise, not apparently, but it is there."
1,didn't work,"sadly :-< Get one of those cigarette lighter adaptor thingys instead, got one and it works great."
1,Didn't work the moment I got it,This tape adapter did not work from the second I first tried it. I however had already thrown away the packaging and the receipt. Need I say more? upsetting. I have purchased another tape adapter since which works perfectly by maxell.
3,Seems to be compatibility issues with some tape decks,"This doesn't work in my wife's car at all- the tape deck just ejects it right away without trying to play it. I was able to use it just fine in a boom box, however, so the device seems to be fine. Reading the various reviews of this product on amazon, some folks love it and some folks couldn't get it to work at all. This seems to me like a compatibility thing- some casette players will recognize it as a cassette and play it, and some won't. Might just be you have to try it to find out how it will work on your equipment."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this adapter to use with my I-Pod shuffle so that I could listen to it in the car. I have a very good aftermarket stereo system that sounds great, but when using this adapter, it sounds like I stuffed cotton balls in my ears. The sound was muffled, had no dynamic range, and was unbearable. I have since tossed it in the garbage, where it belongs."
1,Worthless,This stupid thing didn't work at all! I tried it in 3 differnt cars and all it did was runn real fast and pop out. Don't waste your money! I ended up returning mine.
4,Works great even though it is now a bit outdated,I bought this back in 2003 never reviewed it now I get a post to review. If you want a standard def combo kit this is the one for you.
2,A disappointment,"I thought all dvd/vcr combos were probably pretty much the same. I had a Sharp which I liked but needed to get another for my the teens' tv room. The Zenith was on sale. I don't use it much but here's what I don't like about it so far: programming is a pain. You can't use the number pad, and unlike even my 5-year-old VCR, you have to use up and down keys for the hour&minutes combined (that is, you push the up arrow and it goes from 12:00 to 12:01, up and it goes 12:01 to 12:02, etc. you can't separate the hour from the minutes for faster programming). On my Sharp, I can use either the number pad (with hour & minute separated) or the up & down arrows. In addition, it seems to have little versatility on rewind or FF. The same DVD which I can rewind in tiny segments on my Sharp can only be rewound (or fast forward) in big chunks on the Zenith. I have a feeling that Zenith is using the oldest available technology. The pathetic thing is that it cost just as much as my Sharp."
1,Service is HORRIBLE.,After two months the VCR stopped recording video. I brought it in for service and it has been three weeks and Zenith has not repaired yet.
1,Waste of Money,Stay away if you want a unit that works. This is my second unit and both of them died within weeks of purchase.
4,Glad we bought it!!,"We shopped many, many, on-line sites and stores.Comparisons and price brought us back to Zenith. We haven't seen this model in any store. The hook-up was easy. The DVD plays wonderfully, as does the VCR!! The whole system is quiet and fast in fast-forwarding and rewinding. The VHS playback is better than the Samsung VCR we had been using. The price was UNBELIEVEABLY LOW for this product!!!!! The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the remote is not universal....a VERY SMALL complaint for the quality of this VHS/DVD Combo. Thanks Amazon!!"
2,Disappointing!,"The best things you can say about the unit is that it's very quiet. However, the response to commands from the remote is extremely slow. By the time the VCR unit stops either FF or REW you're so far past the point where you wanted to be that you have to do it all over again. The Commercial Skip feature sounds great in theory but in practice you have the same problem as with the FF or REW, and you have to use it 4-6 times together with REW. Programming the VCR to record a program can take forever because you can't set the hour and mins independent of each other. There are many other shortcomings with the VCR but too many to list. The same also holds true for the DVD player. Also, since the remote isn't a ""universal"" it has no volume controls so you have to switch to your TV's remote every time you need to adjust the volume. I've had better performance from very inexpensive VCR and DVD units than from this ""high end"" unit."
2,Better Photos on Chechen Websights,"If you want to see what really is going down in Chechenya, don't bother with this liberal bias. Go straight to Chechen websights like ""kavkaz"" you'll see the great photos and videos of wahhabi jihadists sawing off heads and blowing up people! Then read the great descriptions like when it's ok to kill civilians. And how many brainwashed females trained as suicide-bombers. And other nice praise for Bin Laden, Taliban, and terrorist jihadis slaughtering American ""occupiers"" in Iraq and Afganistan. Go straight to the horses mouth and you'll get the real deal not sympathetic propaganda for terrorists. Which not all chechens are, some are just trying to survive. But they won't get any sympathy from America until they kick the Arabs and Wahhabis out themselves."
4,An Artist's comments,I found this work very much to be on my wavelength. Some illustrations were more traditional than I had hoped but some will provide me with stimulation to be even more abstract in my approach to landscape.
5,Jane is an incredible talent,"Jane Eaglen is an incredible talent, just look at the number of her engagements and the amount they are paying her, EVEN with her large size. I have heard her live and sung onstage with her, no one can touch Miss Eaglen.To say that she is not a great talent is to demonstrate a complete lack of credibility to your knowledge of operatic singing.This CD while not a great representation of her abilities is still a lovely presentation of most of these arias. But to get the Real Jane Eaglen expirience, one must hear her live."
3,Quite dissapoited,"Well,for a heavy soprano,her performances are quite good,but i don't like the style of the conductor,i feel nothingwith his conducting,under his baton,jane can do nothing but justsing only,like other reviews,her voice is beautiful,huge,warm,but less poweful,after this album,i bought her ""Four Last Songs"",she did a good job with this album,her voice is pure and the legato line she made was one of the best four last songs i have heard(although norman's was the best).I've sang for five years,it's not easy to control a voice which is heavy,broad or huge,jane has done her best.I like her,and i'm look forward to her Aida."
5,MAGNIFICENT ARIAS RICHLY DELIVERED,"Sung with beauty, energy, and endurance these well-loved arias are superbly rendered by soprano Jane Eaglen. Butterfly, Margherita, and Sister Angelica have seldom been given such heartfelt life.This CD focuses on the work of the incomparable Giacomo Puccini, presenting seven arias from five operas. Granted, I have a bias here because of my admiration of this composer's work, nonetheless I would unequivocally state that these arias find hitherto unexplored dimensions with the emotional and vocal agility of Eaglen. Her voice embracing ""Che tua madre"" is especially moving.With Tosca we again experience ""Vissi d'arte,"" now transformed into a poignant prayer. Turandot is, of course, without peer and ""In questa reggia"" the perfect vehicle for Eaglen to showcase her vocal amplitude and passion.Richly delivered, magnificent arias, what more could one ask?- Gail Cooke"
2,Jane deserves better!,"I can't believe how poorly Jane is recorded on this CD. She is such a wonderful singer, she has a huge, beautiful voice - yet you can hardly hear her. She sounds like she was recorded singing in a closet. A real shame because it could have been a terrific CD. The sound engineers get a big thumbs down for this one."
2,One of the feebler film guides I've read.,"I enjoyed the ""Films of the Seventies"" book from this series, and quite frankly I expected better from ""Films of the Eighties,"" which I found not only riddled with typos (not to mention glaring factual errors that a single viewing of the movies in question would have corrected) but saddled with limping, uninspired prose. Pauline Kael's books or the most recent edition of VideoHound will give readers more sharply written and insightful reviews than ""Films of the Eighties."""
3,Decent Treatment of Spiritual Warfare,"This title is a fairly easy read, but was rather disappointing in its treatment of spiritual warfare. While the author avoids the excesses of Pentecostalism and emotionalism that are so often associated with spiritual warfare, he places too much emphasis on the adversary and not enough emphasis on the Conqueror of the adversary. The book is also rather dated.""Disciplined Warriors"" by Chuck Lawless is a much better, much more helpful volume on this subject. In short, Bubeck is good, Lawless is better."
5,all good,"a suggested or required book(s) for class, all good. Any knowledge one can understand is great for all to know"
2,Dry Demonology,"It's hard to believe that a book by a fundamentalist Christian about the Devil could be this dull. Usually the field of Satan-sniffing produces works filled with amusement, even hilarity, and massive evidence of human credulity. This book has only a vast vast number of Bible verses and a few anecdotes so un-lurid that they wouldn't even interest Pastor Fletcher Brothers on a dull day. It does, however, provide a good groundwork for understanding the philosophical basis of the fundy attitude towards demons - if you happen to care."
4,Binocular Compact great,"This binocular compact is great, my husband loves it. Takes a little getting used to the lens. My lashes stick to the lenses, but if you keep your eyes a little far from the lens it's okay."
2,Returned,I couldn't get them adjusted for my eyes.I have a similar pair that is not as powerful and focus is fine.
5,Honest Review,Great value for a compact binocular. Excellent image quality. Its very light and compact and has neoprene case. It has diopeter plus eye relief with twist out eye cups. Wish it had slimmer profile but love the UV high quality lens!
2,olympus 10 x 25 binoculars,I found the Olympus binoculars hard to focus. When I do get them to focus they are worth the price.
4,was not what I wanted,"What I wanted was a stronger pair of binocular but in the small size that I purchased, other wise they were fine"
5,What I expected,"When I bought the Tracker I wanted a small, fairly simple yet powerful pair of binoculars at a low price. These have all the features I wanted and most of the flaws I expected. Great optics cost money but this was a good compromise."
2,Not what I expected,"I thought this CD was the original soundtrack of the movie, not all the guest pop artists singing Christmas standards.In other words, more of the John Williams symphonic score. My main reason for the purchase was for the song, Christmas Star, by John Williams, at least that was on it."
2,enjoyed but......,I ordered both the Home Alone Original Soundtrack as well as the Home Alone 2 Lost In New York - Original Soundtrack. I used to have them both a few years ago. However when i got these and palyed them both cd's where exactly the same thing same songs same artist. I know that they where different. for that i was very disappointed.
4,Home Alone Movies,"I Love Both 1 and 2 of the Home Alone Movies , but i dislike 3 and 4 , i dont supose anyone knows the song that uncle frank sings in home alone 2 in the shower ?"
1,I love it!,"I have to get the soundtrack, the film just sells it to me! One thing however, i remember in HA2 that when kevin does his shopping in the start of the movie and all the sightseeing, i remember a song about shopping on fifth avenue and things. I really enjoyed the song, is it on the CD or does anyone know what it is called?Regards,Mark, 20, Scotland."
2,Terrible Kindle formatting. Very odd story.,"As I read the posted reviews, I wondered if I was reading the same book as they. I found the story strange and not at all interesting. I did enjoy the scene about the opening of the Eiffel Tower (my wife and I were there 2 years ago). And a brief scene with Albert Einstein was fun. But the story just didn't work for me at all. No real excitement.As for the Kindle edition, this is a DISGRACE. There were NO quotation marks or apostrophes at all, which made reading dialogue very awkward. Then there was very poor formatting of paragraphs with multiple dialogues in one paragraph. Frankly it made the book pretty unreadable. Don't get the Kindle edition unless you check the sample (and the poor formatting started right at the beginnig so you should be able to tell)."
5,Great for enthusiastic children,"The Martial Arts Training Diary for Kids is an excellent book for children ages 9 to 11 who are avid martial artists. There are fun activities, such as crossword puzzles and word searches. The book includes Korean, Chinese, and Japanese terminology. There are great stories about other athletes who overcame to become excellent in their sports. The diary segments following the stories get kids to think and interpret the meaning of the stories--so they can relate to them personally. The sections on goals and progress charts are a good start, but they could use some improvement to make them more understandable for children. There is also a chapter on performing kata or forms; this segment has an area to write down forms and instructors' comments. The section on sparring is well written, and contains an area to record tournaments. I think that this book is definitely aimed toward the competitive young martial artist--as the book was written by a taekwondo instructor."
5,Fabulous!,"I'm sure that this theory must be inaccurate; it is certainly funny as heck, and the book is a delight, but I just KNOW that this can't be scientifically accurate.But for the life of me, I can't find the flaw in it. It actually makes far MORE sense than official science. (Granted, this is not hard.) I mean, it's a funny book that doesn't seem to need to be taken seriously; it therefore contains much levity, which it postulates is the opposite of gravity.It also doesn't weigh much.Coincidence? I'm not so sure.I don't think I'll challenge my next physics teacher with it, though. (grin)"
3,better than average,"With all of the [bad] horror...I've seen over the years, it's refreshing to see a movie that at least attempts to tell an interesting story. Yeah, the acting is so-so, the production values are limited, but it's a good effort. Well worth the seven bucks I paid for it. I could have done worse, I could have bought ""Panic Room""."
4,Great Scare Flick!,Great scare flick! It takes you in different directions ala THE SIXTH SENSE. It's been Omega's top seller for years and for good reason.
5,Most profound sacred writing I ever read,"The *Diamond Sutra* is a fundamental Zen text. It is very brief, very subtle, full of the most profound wisdom. I think it is the closest I have ever seen in words to approximating the absolutely ineffable truth of the Dharma. This is a wonderful translation. This is a profound sacred text, perhaps not appropriate for beginners, who will most likely find it inscrutable, but for souls who have experienced something of the Ineffable themselves."
4,good but not exactly what I thought,It wasn't the translation I was hoping for ( mistake on my part) but I found it to be good enough for my purposes.
4,Return to a classic,"This was one of first kung fu movies i saw on the old VHS system and what a movie - titled over here as "" Return to the 36th Chamber"" its a sort of sequel to the Classic movie ""The 36th chamber of shaolin"" - aka Shaolin Master Killer .Again it stars Gordon Liu this time not replaying his role from the original movie(San te) but playing a new role as con man who comes to the aid of his oppressed dye workers who are being bullied by manchu henchman , originally hired to fool the henchman into believing he is San Te from the shaolin temple , when his bluff is called , he is severely beaten and thus vows to learn kung fu at the shaolin temple to avenge his friends . Great martial arts feature throughout this movie (as you would expect from a shaw brothers film) with a all star cast as well as the lovely Hui Ying Hung (in a non fighting role)this is a must and with the low price how can you go wrong....."
1,No,"They sent me a dvd box without a dvd inside and supposedly it was ""brand new"" I will no make any future purchases from this place."
2,Meh,I'm a huge Chinese Kung-Fu fan and a huge Gordon Liu fan and a huge 36th Chamber fan.This video? Meh. Save your money. Most of the video is Gordon building scaffolding. The fight sequences offer nothing really new except he ties people to bamboo poles.
4,This was a good kung fu action film,"I am a kung fu fan and enjoyed the movie. However, when compared to the 36th chamber of Shaolin, which sets the bar for measuring this movie and another one in the series it comes out mildly entertaining. I would still recommend it for purchase, but only for the most devoted kung fu fans."
3,return to the 36th chamber,movie is not what i expected. have another movie with this actor and he has went through the 36th chamber. movie was good and interting.
5,"Classic Chinese/Shaw Brothers, one of the best","I won't go into detail about the story, but I saw it many years ago, forgot the name, and lately used the internet to figure it out and find a copy of my own. Wow. It was an impressive story, lots of action, good moral lesson, and just fun to watch. The title, Master Killer and Return of Master Killer really takes away from the actual story. I wish the title had been more realistic, like Fence Builder Becomes Hero, or The Man Who Learned Kung Fu from a Scaffold. It was worth five stars when it came out, and I think it will remain so for...it's a classic."
2,Dont believe the hype!,"This movie has potential. Gordon Liu, Shaw Bros., Shaolin Master Killer. Sounds tasty right? Rent this movie. Its mildly entertaining. But not enough to own. The best part of the DVD are the extra fighting sequences provided as Special Features. There are a few money scenes, but it cant even begin to compete with other Shaw titles. Admittedly, the fighting styles are things you have never seen before, but are really pretty lame. (I cant get into it with out spoiling, sorry.) The Shaolin temple is only in the movie for a brief period. The Master Killer isn't really ""that other Master Killer."" The plot doesn't even begin to convey any drama or passion. Skip it. Or rent it. Or if you are a die hard collector and need to expand go get another one of the Deadly Venom films. If you own all of those, get any of Toshir Mifune's samurai films (not really the same style but will be a much better investment.) If you must get this, you've been warned, its amateur at best."
2,beware who you buy it through,"when I purchased this for my 5 yr old son, I got a used one because it said that just the edge of the book was a little worn, when I finally got it in the mail, all of the pages were defaced, so of course I couldn't wrap it up for his birthday. I think the book, had it been in good condition, would have been great."
2,"""Not What Was Expected""",This book only shows the jewelry makers symbol that can be found on the inside of jewelry. My wife was expecting to see a little history behind the jewelry and at least some pictures of different types of indian jewelry. She was extremely disappointed in this book.
3,Hallmarks of the Southwest,"Although the exchange process was easy, both copies of the book that Amazon sent had pages either missing or hugely out of order. I wished there was a way for Amazon to check the copies, under such circumstances, before sending them out."
4,Hallmarks of the Southwest,"Great reference book with lots of information, great pictures and well-organized marks section. Of course, not reference can ever have every mark on Native American SW jewelry, but this one tries hard."
5,"Delicious, but...","This is not your Good and Plenty sweet chewy licorice. It's potent, hard drops of real licorice extract. Yummy and addictive to those who have acquired a taste for it, but shockingly bitter to those expecting little kids' movie theater licorice. Give it a chance. You didn't like beer your first time, either."
1,don't bother!,THIS PRODUCT IS INEDIBLE!!!sorry fellow black licorice lovers!!! i've sampled these to friends also every time they were SPIT OUT INSTANTLY!!!! very FIRST product from amazon site i was disappointed with!!! usually EVERYTHING IS GREAT!!!O
4,Why This is 4 Stars,I rate this book 4 stars because the chapters are very short.Pluss Jake is only lost for like a half-hour.It was a goodbook tho.In some parts you get woryed or even scard!Find out whyin A Winters Tale.
1,Horrible value system for kids,"This was the first Puppy Patrol book I picked up for my daughters. Thankfully, I read it first. In the first chapter alone, the main character refers to an adult by name with no title and calls his sister names and tells her to shut up in front of his mom who doesn't respond. One of his friends calls another ""you fool"". That did it for me, it went straight to the trash. Yes, I know some children behave this way in the real world, but that doesn't mean we have to print it. After all, literature should help to raise our children's behavior expectations, not lower them. How would we expect them to behave differently?"
1,Very Disappointed!,"I was looking forward to hearing the old songs again. Needless to say the songs are there, but they are not sung by the original group!! (And the disc package doesn't reflect this!)"
1,Not Happy,"Perhaps I am an idiot. Somehow I imagined an 'ULTIMATE' guide would have altitude and depth but this thing only has the viewpoint of an eagle overlooking a mist across a thin shallow lake valley. OK, This book by chatty head-tappers might encourage some young or lost folks to write games scripts but it sure as hell won't show them what to do. To do that, they'd ned to show us at least one whole complete real sample. I feel just a little insulted. I'm not the baby they wrote this for. Nor are you, probably. On the title page we are told it was edited by SKIP Press. Good advice."
2,Very basic,"I don't know why they decided to go with ""The Ultimate Guide..."" rather than ""A Basic Introduction to...""There are really no advanced ideas in this book. Descriptions of the creative process are presented in an imprecise, unhelpful way. The following is an exaggeration and not a direct quote, but this is how the book felt to me:""First, think about what type of game you want to make. Next, make something that resembles what you were thinking. Finally, change it until it is more like what you want. Take into consideration that your game will change as you make it.""Maybe there is some use here for other people, but I found absolutely no practical advice anywhere in the book. I do not recommend this."
5,Present,Grandson loves it and is into video games.Son-in-law loves it and Grandson wants it back.Daughter is computer teacher and still waiting to read it.
3,Open-Water Swimming for Dummies,"Good book for beginners and newbies. More of a technical manual, than a story."
3,Triathlete Review,"Although I thought the book to be well written and interesting, it offers minimal techniques and workouts for the triathlete. Not being a long distance swimmer, I can not judge the book from that point of view."
2,Item Discontinued and Out of Date,"This label maker makes labels as good as their $20 machine. If you're buying it for the computer interface, forget it unless your computer can accomodate a ""firmy disk"" and a serial port. I haven't seen those in ten years."
4,Rob Boyd - Acting Debut,"First of all, I'm not Rob. I will admit to being a friend of his though. I saw this movie years ago and I thought it was pretty good in a campy B movie sort of way. Be sure and check out Prize Fighter it has a good story line with a lot of local interest if you're from northeast Oklahoma."
2,not that great,"This movie actually has a plot. It's a drama with some kung-fu, although the action and fight scenes were not that great. But the twist and turns makes it some-what-o.k."
4,Good Book with a lot of Problems,"This book is an excellent source of aritmethic problems. It has a lot of exercices, which can be used to supplement the work kids do at school. I bought the book because I wanted to give my daughters work extra from school. The book has a lot of excercices to choose from. I need to translate the problems to my kids. Interesting book, it is appealing to kids who like books."
5,LOVED IT,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN INTERESTING READ THAT KEEPS YOU TURNING THE PAGES SIRO IS FOR YOU. I HAVE ENJOYED READING ALL OF DAVID IGATIUS BOOKS BECAUSE THEY RELATE TO REAL LIFE EVENTS, ARE EDUCATIONAL, AND HAVE SUCH WONDERFUL PLOTS. I COULDN'T PUT THIS ONE DOWN. ALTHOUGH THE ENDING WAS A LITTLE UNREALISTIC IT WAS STILL A GOOD READ."
5,A writer's writer,A most engaging and adult treatment...which is rare in these days of pop writers.I recommend all of his books to anyone who enjoys sophisticated writing and adult ideas written in a thoughtful and satisfying way.
4,Great history lesson,"I stumbled upon this book in a secondhand bookstore 21 years after it was published. This is a very believable story about a nontrivial topic you can actually learn something from. Strangely, that is sometimes difficult to find. It's unimportant that that part of the world now is vastly different due to the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Just call it a history lesson.Ignatius has a keen sense of humor, which is clearly visible in the dialogue. That aspect makes me think of Nelson DeMille, a very different author, but also with an uncanny ability to create entertaining dialogue.It was a very interesting read. Recommended."
2,Disappointing,"There are only two tracks on this CD: two versions of the same song, each is too long. Not their best stuff."
1,Good ways to end your career,"This book has some good ways to completely ruin your career and reputation. If you write reviews under other names and post them to your site, or pose as two different people on discussion groups, you WILL get caught. And when you get caught, someone will discuss it on their blog. And when they do, a Google search on your name will bring up the fact that you tried to deceive people into buying your book.Real pros don't have to lie.Even if you don't see anything ""wrong"" with it, you should realize that your IP number follows you everywhere you go, and you WILL get caught.Some of Fischer's ideas are good ones. It's a shame he felt he needed to include deceitful tactics."
2,An Early Death...,"Our kids got us this coffeemaker last year for Christmas, and it died a few days ago. I didn't use the gold filter basket (included), because the fine coffee sediment leaked through (leaving the fine grounds in the bottom of your cup...ewww!) So, I just used a typical ""cupcake liner"" filter. I did like the ""auto shut-off"" feature, and coffee taste was o.k., but it was hard to fill with water (the lid lifts off to the back, and you have to have good aim!), plus the carafe leaked everytime I poured coffee, unless I poured way too slowly. I'm disappointed that this was not a cheap machine, but only lasted a year. When I go to buy my next coffeemaker, it won't be a Black and Decker."
5,Coffeemaker,"The coffeemaker was reviewed in Consumers Report Mag. And works very well,as defined in that reprot."
3,Adequate coffee maker,"Adequate coffee maker. Makes a good cup of coffee. Uses basket type filters, not cone filters."
4,Recommended by Consumer Reports,"I ordered this coffee maker in late 2008 because it was the top-rated ""Christmas Gift Idea"" from Consumer Reports. Lo and behold, a few months after we received it, Consumer Reports did another coffee maker rating, and this Black and Decker didn't even make the top 10 list!! So much for timing. It's a good machine, but awkward to fill with water since you have to crack open the entire top. Also, the cup scale is impossible to see unless you turn the coffee maker 90 degrees to the right. The carafe is easy to use and pour; the programmable feature is nice. My biggest complaint is that it doesn't get the coffee hot enough. The coffee is very warm, but not hot enough for me."
2,Weak luke warm coffee,We wanted a larger coffee maker for when we have guests but I normally only fill to the 4 cup line (equals 2 real cups) for my morning brew. When brewing less than 10 to 12 cups this coffee maker turns out weak coffee that cools off really fast.
4,Great Deal,"Truly an amazing gift, for the right price. I wake up every morning to the sweet smell of well brewed coffee.This product has all the features, that one needs- really just great."
5,Very good machine for the money,"I bought this machine after watching an episode of ""America's Test Kitchen"". It won their best coffee maker under $50 test and I have to agree with them. The coffee is good and I like how the machine automatically turns itself off after 2 hours. No more burnt coffee pots or worrying about if I left the machine on."
3,"Really wanted to like this, but.........","I bought this item in April 2008 and since then I've had two problems. First, the pot leaked. (So much for all the no-leak pot reviews!) I called and they sent me a new one; much better. Then today (admittedly, a year and a half later with once-a-day use), it just quit brewing. Again I called and they are honoring the two-year warranty as stated on their website--I just have to send it back and pay shipping to get a new one, but it's still better than paying full price. Customer service was friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, I think I got a lemon! Other than that, I like it, so I'm still giving it 3 stars."
4,"Very good, with one caveat","I got this coffeemaker at Walgreen's for $20. I like everything about it except the location of the controls. One time I didn't seat the coffee pot properly, and coffee leaked all over, which fried the controls at the base of the unit. My fault I know, but I wish they would put the controls on the side or better yet up top. The unit still brews, but the clock and timer are toast."
1,Leaks all over the counter,I got two of these coffee makers. I bought one at Target and had to return it two weeks later as water leaked out of the reservoir on the counter. I just got another one as a Christmas gift and deja vu! Water leaking out all over the counter.Other issues. This is a very basic coffee maker and it's extremely flimsy and generally overall just very cheap looking and non-durable.
4,Coffee...No Frills,"I love coffee and needed a dependable coffeemaker that's simply going to drip brew a pot for me each morning. I wasn't looking for something incredibly complex, just a solid run-of-the-mill coffeemaker that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg. So far, this B&D; coffeemaker has been great, exactly what we were looking for.It's nothing fancy, but the coffee's good, the carafe pours well, and we haven't had any issues after brewing numerous pots. If you want more than ""basic"" you'll probably be disappointed, but if not, this coffeemaker is a great option."
2,Not too good.,"Bought this pot on July 27, 2010, today, September 8, 2011 it died. It has been leaking for a month. Last coffee pot was cheap and lasted years, this thing is pure junk. Made a decent pot of coffee, but not built to last. For the price, look elsewhere."
1,"Don't make the same mistake, DO NOT BUY!","Despite all the other bad reviews, I took note of the positive ones instead. Big mistake! I just wasted my money and I can't get it back. Do yourself a favor and buy a different coffee maker. This one lasted only 2 months and just died all of a sudden. Don't take a chance and hope you get a ""better"" one than I did."
1,PITIFUL PRODUCT,"THE FIRST ONE WE RECEIVED WAS USED (SCRATCHES & COFFEE STAINS). WE IMMEDIATELY RETURNED IT. REPLACEMENT WORKED OKAY FOR A FEW WEEKS, THEN PARTS BROKE OFF. IS THIS BEING MADE BY KIDS? IT SHOULD BE CALLED ""BLACK & DECKER STUPID BREW.""RETURNED THIS, TOO. GOOD NEWS: PERSONNEL AT AMAZON & THE TEXAS COMPANY THAT SELLS THESE COFFEE MAKERS WERE UNDERSTANDING AND VERY ATTENTIVE. CONGRATULATIONS, AMAZON!"
3,Ok coffee maker,"Overall this coffee maker is pretty good. It seems to make good coffee, the pause and serve function works well, and I don't have any problems with leaking or anything. However it holds an excessive amount of moisture inside, which causes problems when you go to take the filter out. I have to hold someting under the filter as I remove it or I am dripping coffee everywhere on the way to the trash. Twice now I have had the filter rip because it was so wet, one time dumping grounds all over my counter. I never had this problem with my old coffee maker. I have even tried propping the lid open(which helps a little, but not fully). If I purchased it from a store I would return it rather then deal with the mess."
2,Weak Coffee,"Maybe I am spoiled with better coffee makers, but this coffee maker makes weak coffee. I tried using much more coffee than recommended hoping it would make i stronger, but it was still weak. Easy to use though. I think I'll just get a french press."
2,"Good construction, bad coffee, poor electronics","We purchased this when our very basic - but excellent - Braun KF 510 stopped working after 4 years. Unfortunately for us, the KF 510 seems to be discontinued, and we chose this as the replacement.Our machine is on its way back to Amazon because a) it was broken (the clock ""reset"" after every brew) and b) the coffee just wasn't very good (which is why it's a return for refund and not a return for replacement). The coffee is barely warm (not hot) even directly after brewing. I assume the lack of heat also has something to do with the weak coffee it produced.Pros: Great Carafe design, easy to use, decent price.Cons: Faulty electronics (search the reviews for ""clock""), coffee is weak and luke warm, red numerals on the clock are distracting (it makes you think it is ""on"")."
3,What drip prevention?,"We bought this device because it supposedly allows one to remove the carafe without having coffee drip onto the warming plate. Wrong! The design of the basket and the frame around it allows water to slip between the basket and the frame. Thus, almost every time one removes the carafe (not just when the machine is brewing coffee) water drips onto the warming plate. Very disappointing. I like the coffee it makes and the time in which it makes it, but I would look for other options before I purchased this model again."
1,Toxic danger,"I purchased a Black & Decker DCM2500B SmartBrew Coffee maker from Amazon in September, to replace a MrCoffee that we used daily for many years. When it arrived, it was thoroughly washed and run through its brewing cycle with baking soda and clear water in the hope that the acrid plastic odor it gave off would be purged from it. It filled the house with the smell of plastic and the water that passed through it was not even potable due to the fumes.I put the unit on our outdoor steps and let it recycle water for several hours, and let the unit sit for several weeks to air out. Then I made a pot of coffee which tasted like industrial waste. I am convinced that this is an unhealthy exposure to VOCs, and should not be used. I have thrown the coffee maker away and am now using an all-glass solution to coffee making. I will never buy another product from Black&Decker;."
3,Not what I had been used to,"My husband and I had another coffeemaker for years before we needed to replace it. I saw this one well-rated in a major consumer magazine and since Amazon.com was offering it at a good price, we decided to try it. It's a nice-looking unit, and it makes decent coffee. However, we were disappointed in the absence of several features we had taken for granted: no signal when the brew was finished, a short warmer timer, only 2 hours, and no warning when the warmer shut off. On top of that, our unit was defective; it started arbitrarily powering off as if there had been a power failure. So we ended up sending it back. No big loss."
5,Black and Decker Great as Expected,This is a great item. I can set the timer for when I want and it will be ready when I need it. No loud noises from the coffee maker. It will reheat the coffee too with no problems. A must buy!
4,Great coffeemaker,This coffeemaker is great because it makes hot coffee unlike the carafe coffeemakers. The timer allows me to wake up to a fresh pot of coffee in the morning. The spout was made to pour without dripping. It's a great coffeemaker for the price.
1,Waste of Money,"After a mere 6 weeks of occasional use, the reservoir immediately leaks all the water when it is filled. The water somehow comes out the screw holes in the base of the machine. When it actually did brew coffee, the temperature was, at the hottest, lukewarm. The coffee does get warm enough if you have the time to leave it on the warming plate for a while.Returning it is just not worth it. Amazon's return policy is confusing, and they will not give a full refund. The phone person said 15-20% restocking fee, but the return policy page says up to 50% of the item's price. I'd have to pay shipping too. B&D; will only replace the unit, after charging me for shipping. I could resell the replacement unit, but I wouldn't wish for someone else to share my bad experience with this product."
5,Great value in a coffeemaker!!!,We are very pleased with our Black & Decker coffeemaker. First of all it doesn't drip when you pour like our old coffeemaker. And the coffee just seems to taste better. We would highly recomend the SmartBrew.
2,Toggle switch quit,"I enjoyed the coffeemaker since purchasing it in March of 2008 until the toggle switch recently quit working. I am disappointed because I had purchased a number of filters, thinking that I would be using the coffeemaker for a long time. Now I have to replace the coffeemaker and have no use for the filters. I thought the toggle switch was a good feature, but I guess not."
1,Poorly Designed Drip Catch,The drip catch failed after only a few weeks. We ordered a new part and it still had the same problem. Save your money and time and buy a better coffee-maker.
5,Excellent Coffeemaker,"After years of putting up with poorly-designed, poorly-built coffeemakers, it is a joy to finally own one that is so good. I bought it after seeing the reviews here & at Consumer Reports and noting that the price is about as reasonable as you can get. It makes great coffee. Uses standard filters. Doesn't drip. Brews the coffee quickly. Stays on for 2 hours. Has an easy-to-see clock. The scheduler works as it should. Cleanup is simple. There are few moving/replaceable parts, so the chances of failure are quite low. I am SO happy I found this machine and can highly recommend it."
3,Good coffee,"The coffee is good, but it is very hard to see the water level on the side window of the maker. I've even tried to move the maker back and forth, but still can'tmake out where the water is.Coffee is made in good time, but it sure makes a lot of noiseas it is finishing up."
5,It works,"I got it and it not only looks great it works. That's what we are all looking for any way in a great coffee maker.I have now purchased three total of these coffee makers, two for gifts and they loved it also. This coffee maker is the best one that I have ever found. I did not have to add any extra coffee and it taste so good."
3,SmartBrew luke warm,"this coffee pot is easy to use and I added a permanent gold filter from a previous Mr. Coffee machine; it fit. If you don't get the pot exactly under the pump, it will leak all over. The coffee is not especially hot after brewing."
2,"Coffee's Good, but Problems Persist","While Consumer Reports gave this coffeemaker a good rating, I have to disagree on two points: one is the clock, which will jump ahead by several hours when you turn your back (in fact, I don't even know if it has the numbers 7, 8 or 9). Hence, you cannot program the coffeemaker because the time is always off by a mile. Second, the pour spout is wide, which makes it nice for not spilling, but not so great for keeping the coffee hot. I have to nuke it for 25 seconds for a steaming cup. Oh, and it has annoying hissing habit, not when it's first warming up, but all the time. You can do better than this model."
3,Okay but not great,"Coffee maker is fully adequate but does not keep coffee very warm and shuts down after just 2 hours. We need to change the start time so that the weekends are on long enough for us to wake up. Also, the tabs on the bottom of the coffee maker come loose when it is move a little."
1,LIARS,Don't go by the specs on this coffee maker if you want it to go under a cabinet...They said 11 1/2 inches high and it's 12 1/2 inches high...Buncha damn Liars..
2,not durable long-term,"I bought a Black & Decker two years ago - the coffee it made was fine (a little weak...I had to double what I normally use), but the carafe is pretty flimsy. It cracked and broke this morning, even though I drink coffee fresh and never leave the machine on for more than 45 minutes."
4,Great coffee maker,"So many reviews........ I bought this coffee maker 2 years ago and have not had any problems with it. Makes excellent coffee, does not drip, no rusting anywhere, clock works perfect. I am a coffee drinker that was tired of getting ""tinny"" after tasting coffee until I bought this Black and Decker. Cleaning the carafe was a little difficult, water would not completely empty after rinsing, therefore I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I am buying one for my daughter for Christmas."
2,Makes good coffee - but for how long ?,"This coffeemaker performs as specified - it makes good coffee - but it is extremely flimsy. The plastic used for the carafe lid is second rate - it actually melted somewhat and broke after 2 uses.After light use for a little over a month, the carafe sprung a leak. Replacements cost almost as much as the whole coffee maker.I have discarded this item and am looking for a better product"
2,Wish it worked,"I really like the style of this coffeemaker and how it made coffee but less than one month after I purchased it it went completely dead, no lights, no clock, no coffee. I have spent several hours on the computer and phone trying to get a call back for service or return. There is no Black and Decker service center listed in the phone book or on the internet in our area (Boise), come on, we're not that small. After 20 minutes on hold for their customer service I left a phone number to return a call to me-we'll see. I liked the coffeemaker (while it worked) but Black and Decker needs to have better customer service."
2,"good coffee, flimsy construction","Bought this unit based on recommendation in ""a major consumer magazine"". It makes good coffee, no complaints there, but it is very flimsy. One of the plastic hinges on the top of the unit broke off the first time I used it, and the top of the carafe pops off with any handling at all (though it easily snaps back on). I generally only make coffee on weekends, but if you're going to use it all the time, you might want to consider a more stoutly constructed unit. Two smaller things: the red digital time display is extremely bright, annoyingly so for me but might be a plus for others. And the auto-shutoff on the warmer is two hours, shorter than I would prefer but again might be preferable for some users."
1,Second Black and Decker disappointment,I bought this model by Black and Decker after I was bitterly disappointed with the first Black and Decker coffeemaker. What a mistake!!!! I like my coffee HOT and this model barely delivered mildly warm coffee. The quality of the coffee was not good because the coffeemaker does not generate enough heat to pull the flavor through simple ground coffee. I'm going back to Mr. Coffee. I'm tired of wasting my money.
4,As good as it gets for under $50,"The truth is there are legitimate complaints about any coffeemaker you can get for less than $50 and most costing much more. I had an older version of this and it occasionally drove me nuts by overflowing. But after looking into all the alternatives, I reluctantly bought a new one just like it.The good news is that the basket fits much better than it did in the old version and doesn't seem prone to overflowing. So far so good. Given the complaints I read about every single coffeemaker I looked at, I think this really is the best bet for a basic unit."
1,I've bought two of these pieces of junk now,"The first one I had was a gift and the carafe leaked from the point where the glass meets with the plastic. The spring in the the sneak-a-cup feature popped out, so I didn't have that after it's fifth use. I kept reading about all the rave reviews here on Amazon, so I contacted B&D for a replacement carafe since it was obviously a flaw in their ""perfectly dripless carafe"". Well, to my surprise the carafe isn't covered under the warranty and I would have to send them $19.99 plus shipping and tax for a replacement. Fine, I ordered one off eBay and guess what!!?? Same problem but this one leaks 4x as much. This coffee maker and the B&D brand (in terms of their warranty and customer service) are reakky a disappointment. I won't buy from them again."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"We have had this coffee maker for twenty days. That's it. And this morning when my husband tried to make coffee the water leaked right out of the reservoir. I couldn't understand how this could possibly just happen out of nowhere so I tried it myself just to see what was happening. I poured 1/2 a cup of water into the carafe and sure enough it immediately began leaking out of the bottom... out of several different areas. We have owned much cheaper coffee makers than this one and we never had problems with them. I wouldn't be so frustrated if we had owned the product for a longer period of time, then it might be understandable that something had worn down... but twenty days?! So weird... and so frustrating because we need our morning coffee!"
2,Okay as long as you don't use cream,I was disappointed with this coffee maker in that it would not heat the coffee sufficiently. Adding cream would make it lukewarm and this is unacceptable. I have addressed this issue with Black and Decker and they told me to cut off the plug and send it to them along with proof of purchase and they would send me a replacement. What do I do in the mean time for my wake up aid?
4,Not a hot cup of cofee. But will do...,"I thought this might be a good choice based on reviews here, but find the temperature of the coffee just can't get that ""ah... good"" response -- even though the flavor is fine. A plus is that there is no extra charcoal filter or anything to replace and it also takes the standard type filters -- not cone. It'll be a good backup, but I plan to go with the other top seller that provides a nice hot cup.Oh, the red LCD on the front of this unit can be a bright. If you hold your fingers over it, they are all aglow in red -- something a little less bright would be better, but that's just a personal preference."
1,A lemon or just Bad...,"Could be a lemon or a bad design. It leaks from the underneath part of the spout. Not the spout where the coffee is poured so no matter how careful you pour your coffee yo end up with coffee on the counter. When I pour coffee into the reservoir it leaks onto the warmer. The warmer's finish is wearing off within the 1st week. Coffee's temp should be much hotter than what comes out.Could just be a lemon, but this is the worst coffee maker I've ever purchased and I've owned a few at 56 years old."
5,Good coffee maker!,"I read dozens of reviews of different types and brands of brewers when I was contemplating this purchase. Seemed like all of them, whether expensive or inexpensive, had pos & negs. The truth is, all of them are machines and all can break down. Something that gets used every day and is run for hours at a time can quit unexpectedly. And of all things to break down, if you come out in the morning and find out your coffee maker isn't working, you tend to be a bit crabby about it! I decided I would buy inexpensive, and then if/when it needs replaced I wouldn't have so much heartburn over it.That said, this is really a VERY GOOD machine! Finally I can fill the reservoir without water running down the side of the pot and all over the counter. This is thanks both the great pour spout AND the big access to the reservoir. The machine is easy to program, and has a 2-hour auto shutoff. That's all I require from a coffee pot."
1,quit after a week,"We bought this to replace an identical one that dripped. It worked great, no drips, for a week. Then it just quit completely. No sound, no nothing. Very inconvenient to wake up and no coffee! We sent it back and are waiting for the credit. I read in Consumer Reports that it is discontinued. Buyer beware."
1,not well designed,"We bought ours 2 months ago. Typically we make a strong pot to the 6 cup line. The 1st time we used it, the 'sneak a cup' feature caused a back up when it overflowed the paper filter. With no separate filter at the water entrance the heater element packed up with overflowed grounds and refused to perk. After flushing it out (and pulling the save a cup feature off the unit) we noted that the pot is poorly designed and dribbles. My guess is the plastic lip varies from unit to unit. A trip to WalMart resulted in a new Mr. Coffee pot that works great.Perhaps Macy's bought a bad lot, but we are never buying a B&D; coffee machine again."
1,Only lasted 4 months,"The machine broke after only 4 months of use. As the on/off button no longer works, the piece is essentially useless."
3,Got over 3 years use.,"We bought ours from Amazon in April 2008 and today it just didn't make anymore coffee. The power light is on but it doesn't brew coffee anymore.Was great while it lasted. Simple, the program function made for convenience and fresh coffee in the early mornings. I wish it had a longer keep warm feature as the auto shut off usually left me cold coffee after hubby brewed his pot before work. I'd wake about an hour or two after he's gone to work.Not a bad coffeemaker for the price but it surely didn't last the 10 years our last maker did."
2,Quickly developed psoriasis,"It makes coffee reasonably well, which is the main reason for its existence after all. But very soon after we bought it, it began developing a nasty-looking flaking and blistering on the face of the heating element. Doesn't affect its functionality but looks like hell."
3,Average and doesn't last long,"I bought this coffee maker less than a year ago. Setting the alarm for the brewer stopped working altogether months ago (the very reason for me getting this coffee maker), so now I have to wake up and wait for the coffee to be brewed. Yes, I know there are far worse things in life, but it was the whole reason I got this one in particular. When it finally dies altogether, I will be looking for a different maker and model."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this brand name coffee pot for my son-in-law. He was so excited to receive it since it was a surprise for him. His old coffee pot was just about to bite the dust, and about time, he has had the old one, Gevolia, for at least 5 years, probably longer. He and I both were under the brand name impression that this, Black and Decker coffee pot would go on to work even longer than his old coffee pot. He loved the added features too. After responsibly using the coffee pot daily for only one month is stopped working. Just wouldn't brew. I was shocked. I am writing this review as a beginning to have the coffee pot replaced with one that will withstand normal use and time. Sorely disappointed."
5,Black & decker Coffee Pot,I like this fast model with pause and serve and 2 hour turn off. I specifically chose this model since it was the same one I had before so that in the event I broke the carafe I would have a spare.
2,Great for price but NOT DURABLE...,Used it every day for 15 months - until heating element burned out - and is now useless and beyond limited 12-month warranty.
1,Poor quality,I purchased this coffee maker for myself. I made 2 cups of coffee per day for exactly 2 weeks and the coffeemaker stopped working. Terrible.
2,Clock Trouble,This is the second Black and Decker coffee pot I've had. The first one had problems with the clock going out so I had to send it back. After receiving a new one it worked fine for a couple of years until the base started to leak. I just ordered a new one and this one has a screwed up clock again. The time does not stay set so you can't set the clock for automatic brewing which is why I bought it in the first place. I'm still waiting for my replacement coffee pot to arrive but I won't trust Black and Decker again.
2,DCM2500B SmartBrew Coffeemaker,"Bought this because of the top rating in Consumer Reports.Making and pouring coffee was great. However I sent the first one back because the clock would go berzerk after a day or two and therefore the auto brew would not come on when it should. We woke up to cold coffee that was made in the middle of the night. When the clock changed you couldn't reset it because it would go from 1:00 to 19:00 (rather that 1:00 to 12:00 AM/PM as when first plugged in), almost like a timer. We had to unplug the coffeemaker for 30 seconds to get the clock to reset only to have the same thing happen in a day or two. Sent it back for a replacement and the new one did the same thing. Maybe our kitchen TV or Laptop was causing interference because they were close to it. Either way it didn't work for us. We sent the second one back for a refund and bought another Braun, just like the one we were replacing in the first place."
5,Excellent coffee maker,"User friendly. The carafe pours a high or low volume without spilling a drop. Making 8 cups instead of 12 will take the recommended 5-6 minutes of brew time. As with all other home use, drip coffee makers I have used, the water could be delivered to the grounds at a higher temperature."
3,Great Coffee Maker!,"We previously had another Black and Decker, and loved it. Unfortunately the seal wore out, and water began seeping on the counter.Because we liked the last one so much, I decided to try my luck with another Black and Decker and love it! No seal problems on this one. Timed/Programmed coffee, sneak a cup, easy fill water, and easy remove/clean coffee filter basket. This one is a great deal, will make a great cup of coffee and is not a lot of fuss!***Edit on 12/16/2010. I wish the above had remained true, but after 1.5 years the seal on the bottom completely let loose and water rushed all over the counter. It happened suddenly, and I hadn't seen any previous leaking. Unfortunately it was beyond the 1 year warranty, so we just had to chalk it up to spending <$40 on a coffee maker that lasted 1.5 years. Not great, but we probably did get our $40 worth out of it."
2,Nice but.........,I rather have the cone filter coffee maker because you get the best flavor from a cone shaped filter. This coffee maker has a nice pouring spout but the coffee never seem hot enought for my wife and I. Also the digital lights on the clock was a very bright red and we kept thinking the pot was still on and really wasn't which was a pain. I use it about four times then put it in storage for a spare and got another cone filter pot.
3,"GOOD BREWER, BUT HAS A SHORT COMING","DOES A GOOD JOB BREWING COFFEE. BUT, IT NEED A PERMANENT FILTER. ADDING A PAPER FILTER BEFORE EACH BREWING GETS OLD REAL FAST."
5,Greatest coffeemaker,"I bought this coffeemaker to replace a cheaper model. SmartBrew is just that, drip free and easy to fill. Best coffeemaker I have ever had.The price makes it great deal."
1,Lukewarm Coffee,"If we had liked lukewarm coffee we would have loved this coffee maker. However, we like our coffee a bit closer to the ideal brewing temperature of 200 degrees not the 165 this coffee makes brew at. I tried letting the coffee sit on the warming plate for 45 minutes and it cooled even further. On a positive note, it does have a nice carafe (no dripping). We promptly returned it. Not for us."
1,Look out below,Poured water into the container and it immediately ran out the bottom of the coffee maker all over the floor.......Returned
4,Almost Perfect,"This is the second one of these coffeemakers that I have owned and used. I love the no-drip spout and the unit's overall performance. The only glitch was that the plastic clips that secure the lid to the pot were broken upon arrival, but it is still functional in this condition. I will buy another one of this exact model in the future if one is still available."
5,Black and Decker Smartbrew Coffepot,This coffee pot is so easy to use and worth the money. It isn't noisy and it really makes a good cup of coffee. This 12 cup coffee pot is well worth it.
4,Basic Coffee make with a basic price,"For the price it is a great coffee maker. I do use it every day, may be even twice. Use a timer as well.Quality is OKQuality of Coffee is sutisfactory"
1,Defective Digital Clock,Great coffee maker if you don't need the auto brew feature. I bought this coffee maker to replace my old auto brew model. The digital clock would randomly reset the time making the auto brew feature useless. I reordered a replacement and had the same problem.
1,Complete junk.,"This thing is complete garbage. The coffee tastes like plastic, the clock doesn't keep time, it's really slow to brew and the worst part is how badly the caraffe gets when you pour. I implore you not to buy this item. The good reviews are fake. This is maybe the worst coffee maker in the world."
2,pour carafe spout design,"Makes a good cup of coffee just as the others do. With one big exception this carafe's spout is pourly designed; no matter how slow the coffee is poured into a cup the spout spills coffee. Now, if you don't mind pouring a cup of coffee over the sink, or getting the newspaper wet, or dripping on the table...than by all means purchase this coffee maker. Myself, I have had it and replacing with another brand."
4,Nice Product - Makes Good Coffee,"We purchased this coffee maker to replace another Black & Decker unit - the previous one had begun to rust and corrode at the heating plate where the pot sits on the machine - I see that the heating plate on this unit is made of a non-metallic looking material, so that shouldn't be a problem now. I also see that the user controls are placed in much more logical positions on this machine - a much better engineered unit!We have had this for about 6 months now, and it makes very nice coffee, and the machine functions well. Nice price too ($29)."
3,Very pleased for 6 months and then it died,"An inexpensive coffee maker that makes a great pot of coffee. I gave it 4 out of 5 because of the way the whole top raises up to add water and coffee. I had rather have a small separate water lid, but that's just a personal preference.Additional info added 7/29/11If I ever need a coffee pot for 6 months, I would buy this one. It performed flawlessly for about 6 months and then it ceased performing at all in March 2011. I'm sure it was the circuit board that died which is a risk with any electronic device. I only bumped it down from 4 stars to 3 because the failure is probably a random occurrence."
2,Loud with a short life,This was a fine coffee maker for the price...assuming that you're willing to replace it every few years. Ours just stopped this morning - we didn't use it everyday so I don't think that we overused it. We haven't had it two years yet so I'm dissappointed that I need to replace it so soon. It is/was also a very loud unit. I would program it and the water being sucked up would wake us up on the second floor.
1,it didn't last for 3 months,I bought this coffee maker 3 months ago. The programable feature quit working a few weeks ago. I'm going to throw it away because that's the feature that I bought it for.
2,Good Brew for less than 30 days only!,"This was my 2nd Black and Decker coffeemaker. The first one DCM100B failed in less than six months. This one-DCM2500B. failed to turn on 28 days after being put into use. For the first 26 days, the coffemaker brewed perfect coffee,and I thought I had found a winner. Today-November 5, 2010, the pot did not come on. Nothing. The power light was on but the pot did not brew. Something is wrong with the mechanism on these Black and Decker coffeemakers. Will not purchase another. I am waiting for a replacement from the company. Will follow up if all goes well."
1,Black and Decker needs to re-engineer their coffee makers,"I bought 3 of these (yes 3, my mistake). I had heard that Black and Decker was a good brand. ALL 3 of the coffee pots lasted less than 3 months. There is no warning about faulty engineering or poor manufacturing. And when the heating element melts the plastic reservoir for water; there is no warning about the electrical shock hazard as the 2 quarts of water are dumped onto your counter and your electric appliances are sitting in the pool.Yes its VERY easy to program, looks great. But - unless you need a paper weight. I'd say its completely unsafe and unusable.Don't buy any B&D; coffee maker - if you expect it to actually make coffee."
1,Leaky piece of junk,"You would think a large company with engineers could design a coffee pot that didn't leak when you poured from it. Once it was manufactured they must have tested it and found that it was unacceptable, but apparently they did not care. We were going to request a new one because we thought it must just have been a abnormality, but after reading the reviews (which we should have done before we purchased it) that pointed out the same problem and more, we are going to just toss it in the garbage where it belongs."
1,nothing good,"We bought this model to replace an older B&D that quit on us. The new model is slow. Over 12 minutes to brew a pot. It steams up the windows in the kitchen. The old one never did that. The pot dribbles when you pour it if you don't open the lid a little, then you get steam directed on your hand. When you set the timer you can barely see the tiny ""timer"" light. I could tell if the timer was on on the old one from across the room. It was very inexpensive and it makes a descent cup if you are willing to put up with all the other issues. Oh yeah, it seems to only come in black."
5,Great buy.,"This is a great little coffee maker with the right price. It replaces, and improves on, a Krups unit whose tissue-paper thin carafe broke. The B-D has a much sturdier carafe, with the lip surrounded by a plastic protective layer to further insure a longer life. Pours great, no drips. Setting timer is intuitive and easy. Recommended."
3,Shouldn't they last longer?,On one hand I only paid thirty bucks for this coffeemaker. On the other it lasted 2.5 years before it went bust-o.
5,Good coffeemaker,Easy to use and has auto shutoff. 10 of us use it in the office and have had no problems with this coffee maker.
1,Pro's&Con's of on line shopping.,"I though that I was paying more for a coffeemaker because it had it's own filter. That's what the ad said,and it did not. I ended up getting a filter that fit that brand(special size).After all said and done I payed $80. A week later I seen one in Walmart sale paper(same one) for $16."
2,Worked for 1 year.. then dead!,This was a great coffee pot until it died at one year of age. It worked one day but then the next day we turned it on and the light came on but nothing else came on. Don't even worry about buying it!
2,Unfunny,"I've seen a lot of British comedies via PBS and I've really liked Nicholas Lyndhurst in such series as ""Goodnight Sweetheart"", ""Butterflies"", and ""Only Fools and Horses"", but this just wasn't very funny. End of story."
3,K9 Yard Patch- Super Fast Grass Repair 250SF,"So for I can't say I'm very impressed with how fast this grass really grows,based in my expectations elicited from other folks review this product. So for I have planted this grass in approximately 6 little patches on my lawn,approximately 2 weeks now. And to date I have seen any rapid grass growth in those areas like everyone else.I have seen little spurts of growth here and there, but no rapid significant growth. Maybe it's a long-term thing-inmy particular instance, so I'll wait and see."
2,Not impressed,Used 2 bags on spots in small area. Poor results. Very little grass came up. Would naot buy again. Expensive for no result.
1,Does not work,"I purchased this grass seed because my blind dog will only pee in 1 small area. I have tried watering afterwards to dilute it but that just keeps the ground very wet, 1/2 of the area is always in shade. I have never had an issue with the grass in this area until this year when my dog lost his site and will only do his business in this one area. I read about this seed and instantly purchased it. When I got the seed I immediately used it... by the instructions. 2 weeks later I have only a couple little shoots of grass which you have to look at real closely. He has since cut his area in half, I continue to spray his pee in the one area and the other area I do not. So I know that this is not a case of the pee or improper watering.At the same time, a couple other areas where I had some thin spots, I used my regular seed there and the lawn is doing great."
2,Nada-no grass!,Even after totally prepping the soil AND adding a good grade top soil---this seed did NOT germinate---not even a hint of a blade of grass---a real waste of money as far as I am concerned!
1,Did not work,Believe it or not I bought this product twice thinking I did not apply the product correctly the first time.... Secound time result same as the first it did not work.
2,Not worth the cost or effort,"I purchased this with the hopes of patching up some dead spots in my yard from my dog, as well as some spots where the grass wasn't growing as well as it should.Well, on the positive this grass DID grow. I had a high success rate with the seeds germinating and having grass come up. That wasn't the issue.The issue was the strength of the grass. It was VERY flimsy, no matter how long I let it grow it did just not get the thickness that the rest of the grass had. It also would start to die if it didn't receive a lot of water, and we're talking much more water than the rest of the grass, including sod I had down.Every area where this grass was has been replaced with grass from other places in the yard from gardens I dug up this year. This product is a good idea but didn't work out for me."
1,No grass,"Bought this product 10+ days ago, and watered like mad. No sign of grass, just bought some regular seed, same as I've used in the past actually and will see if this works as in the past. Maybe it's just a problem in S California."
1,Did not work for me,"We have been using EZ Seed but it is pricey (although it does work well). This product looked like plain seeds and I will admit that I did not do a lot of soil preparation prior to using it. I removed the dead grass and spread the seed liberally, keeping it moist. I did not cover it with any type of mulch. In short, grass did not grow. I do the same thing with EZ Seed and it works well in our lawn so that is what we'll be going back to. This is a case of getting what you pay for."
4,Surprised!,Our Golden wrecks our yard every summer and we've tried many so called solutions. This held up to promise and regrowth of grass was fast. Will get more this coming summer.
5,"Surprised, but it worked!","My boyfriend mistakenly put water softener salt on my front lawn - killing it. The dead area was quite large and easily noticeable. I decided to find something that was a ""quick"" repair and purchased a bag of the K-9 Yard Patch. I followed the directions to the letter, turned on the sprinklers once per day and about a week later, I have beautiful grass in the area. I'm going to purchase more bags of this miracle product to fill in other bare areas of my lawn. Great product that does exactly as it says."
4,Very good,"Fits very well on the cellphone. Let's you take pictures with both cameras, take out the memory card and everything else without taking the case out.The only disadvantage is that if you drop your phone from a considerable height, it will brake apart, but your phone will be intact."
1,Looks can be deceiving,"First of all, this is not a Swiss Army Watch. It is not even Swiss made. They did a great job photographing this watch to make it look like it is more than it is...which is junk! From the picture the case looks like the bezel. Its not, it is clear plastic. I would have known that had I read a little more about the product before I bought it.Also, Amazon is advertising this as a $350 watch on sale for $59, ""Save $299.00"". Mine just arrived and when I took it out of the box the price tag says $79.99. I seriously think the box is worth more than the watch. After getting my hands on this watch I wouldn't have even paid that for it! Not sure if Amazon is guilty of Bait and Switch or just False Advertising but they should really be ashamed of this product."
5,"Works with KVM, PC and Mac","I have a PS/2 KVM switch (Belkin) that I need to use with two PCs and a Mac Mini. The Mac being a USB only device presented a challenge. Tried to use an Adesso adapter and it worked fairly well but would regularly lose connectivity and would require a reboot of KVM and attached systems to re-establish. I also would not work unless at least one of the PCs on the KVM was also on. So I ordered this cable and so far it is working fine. It did require me on first use to reconfigure my keyboard on the Mac as it did not appear as the same device as under the Adesso. But that's an easy ""press a few keys"" dialog under Mac OS X, so no worries.The Adesso adapter appears to be designed for direct connectivity, while this ATEN cable is made especially for KVM use. It's pretty clear in the product description, but just to confirm- the computer end is male VGA and USB; the KVM end is female VGA and two male PS/2."
3,"Modern straight-up country, 'cept better.","The title here is certinaly misleading; one is likely to read it thinking they're going to find another entry in the new and wonderful world of dark, back-alley, grindout punk/alt country coming out of Chicago and elsewhere these days. But if you're looking for something in the vein of The Blacks or Split Lip Rayfield, you won't find it here. Instead you get well written and well played, if a little uninteresting, modern radio friendly country music without the mawkish and overproduced pop sensibility of the stuff we actually get to hear on the radio. Texas Sun, Memphis Woman, and 440 Horses aren't songs that are going to redefine the genre of modern country, and they aren't going to shed any particularly new light on the world of roots country, but they're still great songs. They ain't Ralph Stanley, they ain't Jon Langford, and they sure as ...ain't Johnny Cash, but they're definitely worth a listen."
2,"Some good playing, but...","This CD has some worthwhile elements to it, but in the end it doesn't add up to much. There is some fine playing from the band and from the guest musicians (notably Steve Hunter), but the songwriting and the vocals have an odd air of insincerity or shallowness to them that is death in this kind of music. Country (or alt. country) music has to be believable to be taken seriously, and this just isn't believable."
2,I wouldn't claim them either,"OK, I took the bait of the group name. The disk is just so-so. It will be a long time before I listen again. It's not the worst in my collection, but it sure ain't the best either."
1,The Worst Thing I've Ever Heard!,This is alt country at its worst! The worst thing on the CD is the pretend ... son's voice which is horrifying! The real Johnny Cash would be appalled. I love new country and alternative country but I hated this CD. My advice - find some real music and don't bother with this bunch of horrible songs.
2,Country for those who listen to rock,"The band sounds like a rock band trying to do what they think is country. Almost every ages-old cliche of honky tonk music is evident with songs about truck driving, ""Having every waitress"" and the obligatory drinking songs.I would recommend Dale Watson, The Derailers or Stan Martin before them."
1,Way too many errors for an 8th edition!,There's no need to say anything else; it's all been covered by the other reviewers. It is absolutely ridiculous that an 8th edition can still pass with so many errors like this piece.
1,"all formula, no concept","My complaints about this book have been covered in other reviews but I wanted to add my low-star rating. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is given one paragraph of space which refers back to four other equations in the text. Understanding the use of this popular equation requires a convoluted page-flipping to try to work through the author's many equations leading up to it. (And by leading up, I do not mean to imply there's a logical conceptual sequence.) As others have written, the chapter review questions aren't covered adequately in the text and the questions themselves aren't always clear. The Solutions Manual for the text is worthless, tossing out more equations and giving no indications of where the numbers used come from. If you're a professor looking at this book for a class, please keep looking. This isn't the book students need."
3,I hope you don't need this book for a class...,"The content is alright, i guess. The main problem is that lots of the example problems have mistakes (this is common) varying from arranging things wrong, to blatant typos. I would not recommend this book for anything other than making it through a class. Though if you can take good notes and use the internet, you may not even need it. I would get it only if the professor will take problems from it."
1,awful textbook,"Obviously I am a disgruntled chemistry student. I will be graduating Cum Laude this spring, and I just suffered through Quantitative Analysis using this book. The problems do not match the examples, there is little background given to the concepts described, and there is no study guide that shows the methods needed to solve problems. My Thermal Physics instructor finally gave up using another Saunders book for the same reasons. Saunders books are more devoted to working problems than describing or teaching the processes that occur. I urge any instructors considering this book to look for a different text!!"
2,Fundamental Chemistry Book,"There is a section of the text book that is pulled from the binding. Not an ""Excellent condition"" book in my opinion.On s positive note, it was shipped very quickly and received sooner than expected."
5,good,i do recomend it to people and dont look on the big side look on the small side looks kinda far but not that much
5,Nice plug,"Works great, I don't know what else to say. Works as described, same quality as anything else really. Did what it has to"
3,In depth but HORRIBLE to read,"International Human Rights in a Nutshell does one thing correctly: It spells out the law in clear, black and white language on human rights and some of the formations of the UN, EU, American System, and African States. On the other hand it is EXTREMELY hard to read as a book because all of the citations are put right in the middle of the reading; as such it doesn't flow at all. It still remains a very definitive reference that any scholar on human rights should have."
3,Nutshell Series: International Human Rights,"This is a good general overview of international organizations created to protect human rights. It's a great starting point if you know nothing and need some direction. Two issues: 1) the book needs to be updated to reflect recent changes in the United Nations organization, and 2) there are so many citations to other references that it is a difficult read."
5,the flesh and the fiends aka mania,"all way round fantastic! Cushing as his usual a-1 performance, donald pleasence outstanding, the two leads and the rest of cast two thumbs up!these type's of films are so enjoyable they belong in a time capsule. They sure don't make'em like this anymore."
4,Learning alot about Dog Behavior,"I ordered this book because it seemed to deal with what my issues are with my dog. We adopted her a couple of years ago and she is a very reaactive type dog. Reacts to loud noises, people, anything can set her off and it needed to be corrected so now I am learning about changing the behavior. I've just started reading this book so can't give a complete review but what I have read so far it makes perfect sense and I hope to conquer this reactive behavior with the help of this book."
3,Very Helpful,"Helps reader understand the why's of your dogs anxiety. After putting the ideas to practice, my reactive dog is doing much better and seems more relaxed!"
2,Scaredy Dog,"There were some helpful parts but I have a reactive dog and I have worked for 13 months non stop, and read lots of books and talked to lots of trainers and been in tons of classes with him. Most of the stuff she wrote, I already knew, but some was a helpful reminder. Actually some of it was a little amaterurish. I read 3/4 way thru and put it down, got bored."
4,more about reactive than scared,"I did get a lot out of 'Scaredy Dog' but the title was somewhat deceiving. My new (rescue) dog is very skittish but doesn't bark or lunge at the things that scare her. She cowers & tries to run away. I was hoping 'scaredy' would apply more to that type of behavior. Regardless, her tips on how to help the dog when a stranger approaches was still helpful to me. And of all the dog-training books I've read to help me I found, in this one, the most inspirational advice of all. Author mentions how one may wonder, 'Why does my dog have to be the one with this problem?'. Her answer is to just accept it for what it is & learn to deal with it. I have found this to be the most comforting & inspiring thing one could tell me :)"
2,The Boogyman classic,"First of all, this isn't the second part of the boogyman there are actually 3 others out on video. Boogyman 2, and Boogyman 3 with it's headlines i can't remember exactly their names but i've seen them all. I haven't seen this one ""Return of the Boogyman"", I literally thought that somebody did a remake after the 80's flicks. The other two are original and do follow the first one and are extremely great. Those are true boogyman classics. I figured this 1994 was a hoax simply because it only went for sale and very few places for rent, very few!!!!"
1,Bad quality and finishing,"It's purely appearance the quality of the rubber band is poor, the edges or corners of the case are bad finished, you feel the sensation you will get cut"
2,Watch has a 40 day calendar.,"The watch is attratcive, sturdy and met my expectations from this perspective. It does have a 40 day calendar requiring quite a bit of stem turning every month end to set the date at the 1st of the month. Where is a 40 day calendar required anyway?? Mistake I suspect. In addition, within a few days one of the surround face inserts inscribed nicely with an attractive ""S"" fell out and can't be found. I would not buy the product again."
3,Good,"When you play the low keys, it is a little hard to make a clear sound especially for my daughter who is 10 years old."
5,It looks great,"I came in a great box, all the instructions and I hope that my grandson lets me play it with him. I'd order from this company again."
4,J-me,She is much like jojo but jojo sings better but the album is catchy if you like teen pop u are in luck
1,Quick...Plug Your Ears!,"Let me first say that I'm a major fan of pop music, but J-Me's album is just too bad. Someone needs to take this girl back to the studio to find a new sound. Her backround music is so loud that you can hardly hear her voice, and when you do, it's very bland. She's not especially pretty, she doesn't have hardly any talent, and doesn't even have catchy songs. Why don't some of these lables sign artists with natural ability so us pop fans can have something halfway decent to listen to, huh?"
1,"First 5 mins. is Great, Gordon and David very Slick, but Director Fell Asleep after that","I don't know what happen to the rest of the movie...; the director I think started out great, the openning scene is fantastic between David Chang and Gordon Lui, but after that it seem as if the director fell asleep. It lacked depth, content, continuity, class, choreogaphy styles and above great fight scenes. The whole story and fight scene was completely distorted and had no follow-through...! Ugh..., I don't even know how to make an open honest opinion of this film 'cause it just turned out to be crap. Sorry...."
3,Decent but expensive,The only copy of this is currently listed at $23.00You can buy the Wu-Tang DVD set and get this along with 4 other movies for about $15.00You do the math..
3,it is an ok game,"Well I paid 50 bucks for this game and I am almost done with the game now. I am very good at the game but it is just the same thing over and over, over and over. The grafics are good and the colering is good but it is also easy. They also give you all these weird tasks like knock the guy against the and floor to knock him out I mean come on. It is great in the acade though that's the reason I bought it, but too much of a good thing is bad. But get it if you want. It is alot like tekken tag and I rock with yoshimitsu but tekken is also a simple game."
1,The worst fighting game ever!!,"I never liked the first Soul calibur game. When I played a demo of this, all I have to say is that this game [is bad]!! All you do is fight! No minigames, nothing! Did I memtion that the control is horrible! you cant even jump! And it is just like the first except for the new characters and arenas. Oh and link dosen't wear a dress!! You can see his undies!!"
4,The best fighting game on the gamecube,First of all the game is the best fighting game on the gamecube final. second of all it does not need mario thats what you have melee for. and third the person that complained on the game that they kill you before you kill them he could try playing the game on easy if this still happens then you need to go in practise and try to pull off moves like with volvo:press guard and x or guard and a and you wont be dissappointed
3,Ok game,"Soul Calibur 2 is a fighting game with a short story mode. I played it just a few times. But its not bad. Also, the charecters were cool."
5,Best Game of 2003!,"Namco's latest installment in the award-winning Soul Calibur fighting series is possibly the best game this year! Soul Calibur II's appearance on the latest-generation consoles is nothing short of spectacular, and improvements made in the gameplay make it better than any other fighting game out there. With 13 historical characters, and a trove of new and unlockable fighters, the fun will never end! Plus, each console has its own unique character (Link for GCN, Spawn for Xbox, and Heihachi for PS2), and the new character Necrid makes his first appearance in a video game. Soul Calibur II is the ultimate party game! However,there are also solo modes, including the new Weapon Master Mode, which gives you the ability to earn over two hundred weapons! Be sure to buy this game today!"
5,Best fighting game on the cube!,This is the sweetest looking fighter on gamecube! And with the Gamecube exclusive character it's no wonder it outsold its competition on PS2 and XBox! (...) It was also voted recently as having the best opening sequence on the console. I forgot the source but I'm pretty sure it was either IGN or Nintendo Power magazine.
4,"Soul Calibur, no contest","If hardcore fighting games float your boat, look no further. Soul calibur 2 combines stunning graphics with an intense story plot, multiple modes of gameplay, and the ability to edit your own character. Choose anywhere from an 8 foot Axe-wielding demonic-powerhouse, to an agile staff fighter.Multiplayer?- there is no competition for soul calibur two in a 1v1 arcade style fighting game. Use combos, special attacks, or just beat the crap out of your opponent/friend with over 200 weapons, 15 different warriors, and your favorite costumes/arenas."
5,soul calibur 2 ROCKS,This is sooooooooo fun that I play it all the time and my cusin plays it too its very fun and i can play it all the time.dont listen to people who say 1 star because there dumb. This game is very good they all the charters fighting is all good and the grafics are great buy it know or else your soul will be gone
3,good game but...,".......one problem,I rather play Spawn instead of Link but its good anyway...So get it cuz its the only good fighting game for cube...overall: 4 stars-LINK= 3 starsOVERALL:GOOD!"
1,Boring,"I used to have Soul calibur for Dreamcast. Recently, I bought it for Gamecube. The game has wonderful graphics, but it is way too easy to beat your opponents. I didn't even know what button did what, and I still beat the first round of opponents with no problem my first time playing. This game needs to be more difficult."
1,the worst version of the best fighting game series!,"So dissappointed!!!I cannot believe that this version of THIS game would actually be worse than the Xbox Version! The graphics are absolutely horrible, worse than Dead Or Alive, worse than the other Soul Caliburs, worse than the Tekkens, worse than the Virtua Fighters, and worse than the Bloody Roar!Gameplay is terrible. The characters have to move so slow in this version.Namco did make a good choice for the special guest star, Link, and that is why this game is worth the one star. It dies not deserve anymore stars."
4,Great Fighting Game with a Gimmick,"Play as Link! Was that enough for me to buy this title? No. But, Soul Calibur II stands on it's own as the premier fighting title for the Nintendo Gamecube. The gameplay is flawless and the graphics are breathtaking. There is a mission mode which is pretty cool and breaks up the redundancy of just playing the computer or a friend. Overall, Soul Caliber II is a rock solid addition to any Nintendo Gamecube collection. Highly Recommended."
5,soul calibur 2,"this a great game!soul calibur 2 will grab you and take you to a an age of souls and swords eternally retold.soul calibur 2 easily has hours and hours of gameplay.overall,the graphics are great and so is the gameplay.Namco really outdid theirselves this time!"
5,The Best Christmas Soundtrack Album Ever!,This is the best Christmas soundtrack album ever -- stunningly beautiful numbers. John Williams is a genius. Don't be misled by the other Home Alone II or Home Alone Christmas albums that are nothing but totally forgetable vocals by country western singers and lounge acts. Get the Home Alone II original score with John Williams conducting!
5,Great Book,this was one of several books we found and read on herbs and herb gardening at our local library. We found it the most helpful and purchased a copy. The company had it to us right away.
5,An exceptional tribute to an exceptional album,"Bruce Springsteen has always been more of a folk artist than a rocker (despite his ability to rock with the best of them). He is a story teller. My favorite albums of his are Nebraska and Tom Joad (for which he won the Best Contemporary Folk Grammy). Even on his rock albums the best songs are the stories imbued with apalacian style folk (cf. The River, expecially the live version).Others must feel the same as I do since some great artists paid tribute to Springsteen's Nebraska. Although you wouldn't expect it of her, Deana Carter blows away ""State Trooper."" Ben Harper also does a great job on ""My Fathers House."" Even though it didn't appear on Nebraska, ""Downbound Train,"" writen around the same time period, is covered beautifully by Raul Malo of the Mavericks. Johnny Cash also covers ""I'm on Fire.""All in all this is a remarkable collection of music."
3,Not as good as I expected,"Upon hearing this CD, I realized an important thing:The only person who can sing Bruce Springsteen's songs is Bruce Springsteen. The songs seemed to lack a sort of energy and ""oomph"" behind them. I think it's Springsteen's voice that adds a considerable amount to the songs.(however, i love ani difranco's version of ""used cars"", it gives me the chills. Also, Johnny Cash's ""I'm on fire"" is definetely not as good as springsteen's, but it contains a certain uniqueness that makes it fun to listen to. Though I love Ben Harper, the way he does ""My father's house"" is too monotonous; the lyrics could be haunting, but the music makes it boring.)"
2,Leave It Alone,"Nebraska is probably my Number One Album. This thing is a rip off. How could so many great names ruin so many songs. I enjoy Hank III but what is he doing in here? Atlantic city is NOT an upbeat hillbilly song! The only redemtion to this recording is Cash's ""I'm on Fire."" What, that isn't even a Nebraska song. My faith in Cash remains strong, he had sense enough not to dirty Nebraska. I will keep the CD only because of Cash's great contribution. Without it I would scrap it.After listening to this thing I had to throw in Nebraska to get the foul taste out of my mouth (ears.) Why didn't they leave Bruce's greatest alone?"
2,Don't bother,"Like many other reviewers, I am a huge fan of Bruce's Nebraska, and I was excited to hear these re-workings of his excellent songs. Unfortunately I have to agree with many others too. It just doesn't work. They should be great but just aren't. And, let's be honest, it's a tough ask to try and better any of Springsteen's performances on this album."
2,Made me long for the original...,"One would think that the spare, straightforward nature of the original compositions would lend themselves to interesting cover versions. Sadly, not so.Many of these covers are needlessly obtuse. Ani DiFranco's ""Used Cars"" comes close, but rather than her usual intensity and directness, we get meandering weirdness. Chrissie Hynde had disappointed me for the first time in her entire career.Los Lobos, Dar Williams, Johnny Cash and Raul Malo do serviceable jobs... but really, this album just made me want to hear the original stashed in my collection.Sorry - this was a waste of cash."
1,A good idea...,"that went terribly bad. I cannot comprehend how some of these ""artists"" were chosen for this. ""Atlantic City"" and ""State Trooper"" are embarrasing to say the least, but they sadly showcase what is now Nashville's finest. If Johnny Cash and Dar Williams recordings had not appeared on this CD, one star would have been too many. Thankfully, these mostly pathetic renderings cannot tarnish the greatness of Mr. Springsteen or his amazing album. Go get the original. You won't be sorry."
3,Somewhat disapointing,"Despite many so-so reviews here I expected to like this disk more than I did in the end. Over-all it's not bad but is somewhat disapointing. My favorite by far is Dar Williams's version of Highway Patrolman, but the disk is pretty uneven in quality and can't be recommeded very strongly over all. Some of it is fine, but it might be better to borrow and copy just the songs you want."
4,Can't Beat the Original,"One of the most moving, outspoken and bold albums of Bruce Springsteen's is Nebraska.Cover songs to skip: Hank Williams III singing Atlantic City, the twang does not belong in that song. Son Volt singing Open All Night, did he forget the words?!Songs to play over and over: Chrissie Hynde and Adam Seymour on Nebraska, Los Lobus singing Johnny - love the beat, Dar Williams - like the female voice on Highway Patrolman, Ani Defranco singing Used Cars, and Lastly Johnny Cash performs I'm on Fire - And he certainly is burning on this tune."
3,Just for Fans,"This one is for Springsteen fans. It's for thosewho think that Nebraska is the best album that Bruce ever made. It's for those who make that claim but, in reality, find it too stark and brooding to actually listen to, so they opt for Born to Run or, if they are daring, Tunnel of Love instead. It's for those who think that Nebraska is bad and only like Bruce when he is performing his anthems...well, no, maybe this is not for them. This tribute to Nebraska(and a few bonus cuts) by a diverse and simpatico group of artists(including Johnny Cash, Los Lobos, and Chrissie Hynde) does contain several outstanding tracks and provides a more colorful pallette for Bruce's austere hymns of struggle and dread. On the other hand, most of these performances do not match the raw power and passion, barebones as as they may be, of the original versions."
2,Pretenders but for one true heart,"Nebraska is as important an artistic effort as THE GRAPES OF WRATH and the original Carter family, so I was really excited about this recording. I really tried to like it. I listened to it on the couch with head phones. I listened to it in the car and while I was working in the office or the garage. But it always seemed like a cheap imitation. Only one singer on this recording made the song his own, and that (you guessed it) was Johnny Cash. In the end, I realized the rest of them were just trying to imitate the Boss and they could get no where near him. I give it two stars because Mr. Cash's cut deserves ten and is worth the price of the CD. But the others drag him down."
2,Confusing.,"This product has so many different connectors it feels like I need to hire a specialist to figure which way is in and which way is out.But it did feel TEN times more sturdy than the picture sudjested. (considering it was a light blue, almost kiddy looking color, plastic)I opted out and got a different, less complex model."
2,Liked veiws but no words!,This could have been so much better.. If someone would have taken the time to narrate. It works good for back ground sound and a look up..
3,A Journey Through Scotland,"I had expected more of a travelogue, documentary treatment of Scotland. However, the scenes are beautiful and the music restful and pleasant, so I guess it's OK."
5,This book is rich in wisdom and solidly based on God's word.,"I Give You Authority shows the reader how to exercise the authority he/she has been given by the Holy Spirit. For many years I have been taught about the authority from Jesus Christ I have as a believer. It wasn't until I read this book that it really took root in my heart that I am a Princess, a daughter of the Almighty God.When I became aware of the spiritual authority I have through Jesus Christ every aspect of my life began to be transformed and freed from satanic influence. I just walk in it and live it, submitting myself to the power of the Holy Spirit.This book is rich in wisdom and solidly based on God's Word. Of all the books I've read, I Give You Authority has had a greater impact on my life than any other single book except for the Bible"
5,Must-read for all Christians,"Dr. Kraft is right! While Evangelicals major on a personal relationship with Christ and emphasize the Truth; Charismatics major on Power. But Christianity involves all three and this book exemplifies that balance. This is an excellent resource on spiritual warfare, especially for those who don't feel very comfortable with the subject. Dr. Kraft treats the topic with clarity and supports all his claims with Scripture. I really appreciate his emphasis on a close walk with the Lord and dependence on and submission to the Holy Spirit. My favorite part was the section on the authority to bless others. A must read for every Christian! Essential reading for parents, husband & wives, adoptive parents and pastors. Thank you Dr. Kraft for teaching me so much and for encouraging me greatly.I shared this book with my husband and he loves it. I also shared it with a friend of mine, whose husband is a pastor. They just purchased a copy."
5,Learn who you are!,"Awesome book about learning your position in the bigger picture which involves our earthly world and the heavenly world. This book really focuses on the fact that most of our lives are spent dealing with the literal world around us. We are rarely taught to consider the fact that we are also walking in a spiritual world that can have an impact on life as we know it. Great book, backed by scripture, that effectively gives us tools to enter into a more tangible interaction with the spiritual world and help us to take back control of our circumstances."
3,great pet trimmer,purchased these scissors to trim snarled hair on our pet cat. they are a good size for this type of project and are much more reasonably priced than those that are sold specifically for this type of task
4,Easy installation but bar rolls.,"Good price, easy to install and looks good. Only drawback is that as round bar doesn't doesn't have a stopper to make it stay put so it rolls when towel is heavy and not balanced. I used painter's tape to make a double side type and tape the end of bar to the holder. That worked."
4,Nice and looks good.,"This Yorkshire Bar seems nice. Just installed, I'm not sure about longevity, but for now, it really helps pull together my bath remodel. Seems to be well made, too."
4,A must-have for a beginner due to volume of color photos,"For a first time purchase of a reference book on Carnival Glass, this book is a must, due to the volume of color photos. (It loses one star due to a few out of focus color photos.) Even the black and white photos are a valuable aid to identifying pieces. Photos, photos, photos!"
3,Fairly nice book...with a few flaws,The color pictures are numerous and nice....the price guide in the back is a pain...it would be much better if the prices were on the same page as the picture. I think the price paid for this book was more than fair.
3,Colorful Pictures Do Not Make A Great Book,"Granted, the color pictures do make for a nice book, however, I found many of the pictures to not show the pattern clearly. Sometimes it was the item they chose to show that caused the difficulty--patterns on cups, candlesticks, and vases do not give me what I need to see to verify the pattern on a bowl. I believe a bit more variety of pictures is need for many of the patterns. I would rather see a picture of a collection with a clear detail of the pattern. As far as the price guide goes, at first I found it inconvenient to flip to the back of the book to check the prices, but I got used to it and put up with it. Carnival glass resources are few, so this book is out there, but in my opinion, it's not a great book or a good value."
5,My favorite testimony of Heaven,"I enjoyed his testimony. Jessie is one of the funnest preachers I've seen. He has a true relationship with the Lord and he explifies joy. His description of Heaven is incredible and believable because it lines up the Word of God. It was so good of a DVD, that I decided to buy my friend one. I do NOT want to let her borrow it, because I am afraid that she may keep it (or borrow it and never return it - Lol)."
5,Must See!,Want a glimpse into Heaven? This video has the ring of truth to me. It informs and highly entertains. I bought several as gifts. Tops on my list of inspiring videos.
5,OH MY MY YES!!!!!!!,"I'm not a Cajun like Jesse Duplantis is, but I can surely relate to him, since I'm a North Alabamian! I think this video is AWESOME and EXCELLENT! His descriptions of Heaven really sound believable, and SO wonderful! I'm gonna start making & giving out copies of this movie-if this won't convict someone's heart, they must have a heart of stone. LOVE IT-LOVE IT-LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,WOW,"I was disappointed at first to see that it was just another preacher getting up and talking to me about GOD. I can catch that on TV any day; however, once you hear what Jesse has to say and the manner in which he delivers it - with humor, love and reverence of Almighty GOD, you'll want to watch it with all your friends and family so that they too can see the wonderful things GOD has done in Jesse Duplantis' life. It is DEFINITELY NOT just another preacher talking to us about GOD!! How Awesome is our GOD??!!"
5,This is even better than the first!!!!!!,"I love this movie is all I can say!!!!!!! It is filled with love and horses, my two favorite things!!!!! BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!I LOVED IT!!!!!"
2,A Letdown,"Like many sequels, it disappoints. Tom Burlinson and Sigrid Thornton did nice work as the lovers Jim Craig and Jessica Harrison. Brian Dennehy stepped ably into the shoes of Kirk Douglas as Harrison. The scenery is glorious and the action and riding quite cool. Notable was Jim Craig's unique demonstration around the skill at arms course after meeting his new rival.So, what is the problem? It simply lacked the movie magic and spark and, perhaps, storyteller's art which made the ""The Man from Snowy River"" a success. I have watched ""The Man from Snowy River"" many times over many years, and still love it. I have watched ""Return to Snowy River"" perhaps twice."
1,Return to Snowy River,THis move WAS very exciting BUT it was also a terrible one as at least ONE horse was REALLY killed in the filming. They tripped the little buckskin horse and he did not survive his tumble down the hill!
5,Return to Snowy River,"We saw the first movie, and like it better than the second one, but it was okay. I don't think I would watch it a second time."
1,Why no Widescreen version?,"It shouldn't be allowed to take a film of such breathtaking beauty and chop it in half. The theatrical version is 2.35:1, as was the laser disc. That the ONLY released version of this film on DVD is the 1.33:1 narrow-screen format is tragic. Film collectors don't appreciate that kind of after-the-fact editing, and movie aficionados don't collect films in the narrow-screen versions, so to release ONLY the chpped version of the film (the film is wonderful to watch by the way) is a true crime."
5,The Snowy River Movies are awesome!!,"I've seen both 'The Man From Snowy River' and 'Return to Snowy River' and loved them both. They are wholesome movies to watch with a lot of action, but not violent. Whenever we had sleepovers these were the movies to watch. I definetly recommend watching 'The Man from Snowy River' first though. The scenery is beautiful, the cast is great, Kirk Douglas playing double roles is always good. The story line, and if you love horses this is a movie for you. It's a movie for all ages and both guys and girls. It's not a total 'chick flick' or a 'guys' movie."
3,It needs to be in Widescreen,I loved this movie. The scenery was fantastic... it's unfortunate that it was only released in a standard version. Hence my reason for a 3 star rating not a 5. I refuse to purchase this movie until it is released in widescreen.
4,Return to Snowy River,Enjoyed this sequal but not quite as good as the first movie. Worth watching however. The horsemanship in both movies is outstanding.
2,Not as good as the original,"Where did Kirk Douglas go? I mean, Brian Dennehy is a fine actor and all but it is something I couldn't overlook. Too many dramatic slow motion horse jumping through streams with sparkling water droplets exploding everywhere shots at the expense of plot. Kind of a snoozer of a sequel, they could have done much better."
4,Great sequel,"If you liked the first one, this sequel is a winner as well. Brian Dennehy does a great job and worth viewing and owning."
1,BEWARE! ONLY FULLSCREEN,"Disney has done it again! They have failed to offer the ""complete"" movie. THIS MOVIE IS NOT OFFERED IN WIDESCREEN! I assume that Disney execs think the viewing public are ignorant to widescreen and only want an exact duplicate of a VHS! Shame on Disney! Other than that it is an excellent movie."
1,Pan and Scan?,"1.33:1? They've got to be kidding! I'm not interested. When it becomes available in anamorphic 2.35:1 I'll buy it, but not until then. Better yet would be a Blu Ray version in 2.35:1."
5,A true see-again classic!,"In my opinion a truly wonderful film. As good if not better than the first. My favorite part has to be when Jim shows how to ride the skill at arms course in a way only he can pull off, and the tip of the hat to Jesseca when he is finished is perfect."
5,Excellent,We have been looking for this video and was very pleased when I found it at AmAzon. Bought it & gave it to my husband and we hExcellentave berg much enjoyeReturn to Snowey Riverd the movie.
3,"C'mon Disney, Release Movies in their Original Aspect Ratios!","BUYER BEWARE! This movie was originally in widescreen but is not released in anamorphic as the first one was/is - what's the deal, Disney? I guess people with tiny tv's want full screen so they can actually see the image, perhaps? Widescreen versions should at least be made available in tandem so that those people of discerning taste in cinematic entertainment can truly enjoy the film. Some Disney movies only ever existed in full screen aspect ratio, but there were many made for the big screen that have only been released in full screen transfers to date. Boycott them and make Disney see the error of its ways! (the three star rating is for the average between 5 stars for the film and 1 star for the dvd release)"
4,Snowy River wins again,"This movie is on par with the movie ""The man from Snowy River"". Like all Snowy River episodes, the plot line and the background scenery are excellent, clean, and for the most part, family friendly."
2,Poor craftsmanship,"This product has a poorly designed and made locking system. The battery works fine if you change the lock. I removed the locking mechanism from my original Canon battery and installed it on this. After this procedure, the battery has provided me with more shots than the original Canon."
3,Could have been better.,The optics on these binoculars seem to work fine but they lose 1 star each for the cheap zoom dial and the twist up/down eyecups. The plastic ring that operates the zoom feels cheap and fragile. The eyecups are a good idea that was executed poorly. Instead of being soft rubber eye cups that you can put up to your face they are made like plastic lens caps that have a 1/2 inch hole cut in them. They twist up and down to change the focal length by about 1/4 inch but there is nothing to keep you from accidently scratching your eyes with the rough edge of the hole cut in the cup.
3,Not Accurate,"While Gallery thought what he was saying in the book was what really happened, sadly it wasn't the way things went down. They have a reunion every year of the USS Guadalcanal group and some years later Gallery admitted that the events were a bit different. He didn't change the way it was written in history, so what he wrote after the war is the way history is seen. Go to this URL and see for yourself some of the injustice that was done to a bunch of men that day. http://u505.dnsdata.com/u-505.htmMarcy, Webmaster for the above URL."
5,DON'T HESITATE! WATCH IT NOW!,"I started watching this and I'm not fond of dingy female protagonists so it kind of lagged for the first couple episodes, but once she showed how smart she is, it became extremely engrossing and I finished this series rapidly. It's now one of my top favorites for several reasons: 1. So romantic!!! Great background music and so poignant. 2. Corruption and nepotism are fascinating in this. 3. Handsome leading guy. 4. Great happy ending. Don't miss out on this - get it now! It's great!"
1,Worthless,"The SPP Chubbs Choice consists of three sections held together with shock cord. Each piece fits loosely into the next. After one week of use, the shock cord broke at the point where it secured inside one end section. No field repair was possible.The length of the SPP Chubbs Choice is set by a telescoping section that is locked by elaborate maneuvers involving turning one piece inside the other and sliding a third piece into place. No directions were given, and no useful advice was available from technical support on the telephone. I eventually figured it out, but I will not bother to explain because the whole thing disintegrates.Save your money and, more important, do not rely on this product."
4,"Stoney Point Chub's Choice Monopod, Grey",I found this cane to be defective and I returned it. I have another cane just like this one that I consider to be just about the finest cane on the market for a traveler like myself.
1,Don't purchase anything with RED SUN on it!,"Anyone that is interested for quality remastered Shaw Brothers DVDs, I suggest Dragon Dynasty. At least they're in conjuction with Celestial Pictures. Even though Dragon Dynasty doesn't have a large selection of Shaw movies, the selection that they do have is worth the money. I purchased a Shaw Brothers movie from Red Sun 2 years ago and I swear that I was watching a movie on VHS. Never again will I ever purchase anything from Red Sun again."
3,Above average old school martial arts film,Above average old school martial arts film. Clever in setting up the necessity of our hero's learning a lighter feminine style of Kung Fu in order to triumph.
2,Not as shown in Picture,"I expected the litter box to have a rim the same siaze all the way around as shown ion the picture. When we opened the box we found that the rim is shorter on the end. My cat has too much energy that's why I need a rim. I don't worry about him being able to get in, I just want to keep the litter in! I was very surprised to see the product as not as pictured. I would not have bought it had I known. Usually Amazon does better than this."
4,An essential disc for all Screaming Trees fans...,"This disc is an absolute must-have for Screaming Trees fans who can't get their hands on earlier albums (Clairvoyance, Even if and Especially When, Invisible Lantern, and Buzz Factory). While the Screaming Trees' best efforts were their final three discs (Uncle Anesthesia, Sweet Oblivion, and Dust), Anthology:SST Years provides an excellent overview of the band prior to changing labels. This disc is chock full of excellent tunes - all which perfectly blend '60s psychedelia, '70s rock, and '80s punk.While the list of solid songs on here is too long to mention, I can say with confidence that it's worth the price just for ""Cold Rain"" and ""Black Morning Sun"". Everything else is icing..."
4,Good Product,"Should mention that it includes the dust cover. I was going to order that separately and was happy to see it included. Photo seems to show that it's a ribbon cable but it's four separate wires. I had to cut the cables anyway, so to keep it under control, I put 1/2"" pieces of shrink wrap each foot."
2,Below average quality hurts a potentially great travel set.,"I can live with the bishops and the pawns looking very similar. It would be nice if the board was a little bigger. But the biggest problem with the set is the fact that the paint on the black squares comes off too easily. For a $20ish dollar set, the board should be of a higher quality."
2,semi good design,"good basic design, but..... Nice to put the lid back on it aside. The pieces never shake loose or move. Great idea for playing a coworker one move a day. However the Bishops look way to similar to the pawns. So at a glance there can be huge mistakes in the game that ruin it for both. You look forward to a good game. Your friend stops by and plays there move, and leaves the queen threatened by the bishop, all because of a visual miscue. Eneded up having to paint the tips of the Bishups with white-out."
1,Junk,"The pawns look like bishops, the magnets come off the pieces, and all the magnets all on the black squares stuck to the paint, ripping it off. Total junk."
5,Just right for us,"Just what we needed for our 7-year-old who suddenly got serious about chess (his school has a chess club). It is very helpful to be able to stop in the middle of a game, throw the lid on and walk away with it. Easy at restaurants, in the car, at a friend's house etc. One improvement would be that the lid snapped on securely so if you drop it from a few feet up the pieces don't scatter. Yes, our magnets fall off. We stick them back on. A little dog visiting our house chewed a castle. We're hoping to buy just one piece from the company and will update post on if that is possible."
1,Junk,"The first set I received was damaged because of it's packaging. The black paint was worn off because there was no padding and it was just taped to the other items box in the order.The second arrived in good condition. I did not use it for some time as I was deciding to clear coat the board so the paint does not get removed on first use. Well when I moved the pieces many were glued to the black paint and removed the paint from the dark squares. Dam, I should have clear coated it at once!Also, the top does not seat unless you lay the pieces on there side. Otherwise you could put pressure on their tops and may break the pieces.Don't buy this set. Go to Wholesalechess and buy a 10 inch wooden travel set.Since I had the problem with the first two sets I contacted the company.Expecting nothing I was pleastly surprise by their intrest in my problem.Maybe I just got two bad sets? I will get back with an update on the third try."
4,Better than other options,"I got this set to play chess with my son. Over all I like the it, but there are many little tweaks in design that could have made it great. The board is rather large to store. This isn't a pocket chess set. Since they are all the same height it's difficult sometimes to tell a pawn from a bishop. The pieces are close to the same size as the squares and the magnets tend to attract as you move around the board.With all of the complaining it is still a good set and I would buy it again. But if other toy makers read this, it would not be hard make better."
2,Poor manufacturing quality,"There are two major quality problems I have with this set:1. The magnets aren't properly attached to the plastic pieces so they tend to fall off when you move the pieces by lifting them off. I removed each magnet and reattached with hot glue.2. The magnets' rough metal surface scratches the board when you slide the pieces. I stuck little self-adhesive felt pieces to the bottom of each piece to remedy this problem.One minor quibble - the pieces aren't initially easy to tell apart but you get used to that.The magnets are pretty strong - kids can play chess in the car, even bump against it with their knees etc. without the pieces moving.Probably wouldn't buy this again - too much hassle for such a simple item."
1,Not worth $5,Pathetically cheap construction. The magnets are simply slipped onto a plastic extrusion on the bottom of the piece so they simply slide off this post and stay on the board when you move the piece. The pieces are indistinguishable from one another. This is like something you'd win at a carny game.
2,very scratched after the first game,I like the fact that the lid fits while the pieces are in place but the board is pretty cheesy and the black squares started scratching off immediately.
4,Great Set Except The Pieces Look alike,I am quite satisfied with this product except for the fact that the bishops and the pawns are hard to tell apart. It's a good set for travel but not one that I would like to use all the time.
5,Carrom Magnetic Travel Chess Set,My son received this magnetic chess set for Christmas. He and his Dad have really enjoyed playing with this set. It is nice looking and seems durable. The really nice thing is that you can interrupt play and you can put the lid on without messing up the positions of the pieces. They stay in place. I am sure he will get many years of use out of this set.
2,avoid,"The magnets become stuck easily and rip off the black paint. The set had a lot of promise, but already I'm looking for a new one."
1,Do not buy this junk item.,"I purchased this item based on the wonderful, glowing reviews that this item had received. It is of the most ridiculous quality that you could imagine. The cheap plastic pieces are too small to be usable, bishops cannot be differentiated from pawns, queens look like rooks, all the pieces have plastic tags hanging on them, the magnets on the bottom are broken on half the pieces, the bottoms have plastic tags that will not let the pieces sit properly. The pieces are too big for the tiny squares of the board. The quality that is spoken of so much in the other reviews is absolutely not to be found in any part of this item. Within ten minutes of opening this junk, I had printed out my Return Authorization and Mailing Label and cannot wait to get this junk away from me. I hate it so much. Buy anything but this junk."
5,awesome,"this was the first ryche album i got and i still think it is the best one. the atmosphere that this album conjures is amazing. all the songs here are top drawer. tate sings flawlessly and the band never has sounded better, before or since. its a shame that the music media brands this type of music uncool, because it is really great stuff. check it out if you're looking for something that doesn't sound like creed(every new band out now). queensryche was truly a topflight band."
4,"Fast Paced, Hard Metal Courtesy of Queensryche","""Rage for Order"" is definately a cool, very fast paced rock album, sounding a lot more like hair metal than their newer albums. I can see some similarities to ""Iron Maiden"" in this album, but the lyrics and vocals by Geoff Tate are outstanding, better than Maiden's. Excellent guitar work and some of the coolest hard rock with intelligent lyrics and smooth, understandable vocals. It's an early work by Queensryche, and it rocks!"
4,Their Second Best,"Rage For Order is Queensryche's second best album, after the self-titled EP. After this, they strayed a little TOO far into the progressive tendencies, and got a little too technical. But this is a heavy metal classic. Every song reaches epic proportions with those melodic, brainy guitar riffs, before exploding into pure heavy metal dynamite. Geoff Tate's shrill howl rival's that of many other metal singers, and is certainly better than Robert Plant's idiotic yelp. This is great prog metal, without taking the prog thing too far ans straying away from heavy metal."
4,Were these guys ahead of their time or what?,"I think if Rage for Order were released today it would go through the roof. A lot of bands today seem to duplicate (perhaps not intentionally) the vocal sounds that Geoff uses on tunes like ""Screaming in Digital"". Nobody was doing it like that back in the mid-80's. So many of those tunes, which were great then, would be so relevant today. They're even greater when I listen to them now. ""Walk in the Shadows"" has one of the best guitar solos ever recorded. The way Michael and Chris trade off is incredible. ""Gonna Get Close to You"" is another great tune. I could go on and on, but I think I'm going to go listen to the cd instead."
4,My sentimental favorite,"This album was my first exposure to the Ryche, and even after 14 years it remains in heavy rotation on my stereo. The band tries a little too hard on the latter half of the album (""Chemical Youth"" and ""Surgical Strike"" come to mind), but the guitar solo in ""The Killing Words"" still gives me chills, and I still don't understand why neither ""Walk In The Shadows"" nor ""Gonna Get Close To You"" didn't become monster hits. I only have one other question though--what the hell does ""Neue Regel"" mean?"
5,The Ultimate Island CD,If you were trapped on an island with one CD~ this would be it!!! I can listen to this CD over and over and always enjoy it. This one stands the test of time! QR's BEST! Music with meaning! I picked this up almost ten years ago and have been a fan ever since.
2,WHO DID THESE PHOTOS ???!!!!,"To listen to this album, you must first throw away the booklet and the back cover of the CD. You just will not believe that QUEENSRYCHE accepted to dress like that, just copying the glam /posers bands that were around America at the time. This single fact alone almost killed the band credibility to me, but they redeemed themselves in OPERATION MINDCRIME."
5,Awesome release,"I love this album. While it was not the first QR album I owned it is the first one that really got me hooked. Great guitars, great vocals (No one sounds like Tate on this cd.)I saw them on this tour and they just amazed me. I pretty much wore this album (yes vinyl) out. A very different album for them or anyone else for that matter. Give it a shot, I think you'll like it."
5,One Of The Band's Best,"Geoff Tate probably said it best on Track 7 - ""I will light the way for us to find order of a new kind...""This is arguably the band's best album. Although the follow-ups of Operation Mindcrime and Empire could also wear that crown. Rage For Order proved the Queensryche was ahead of their time musically and had already come a long was as a band. You can hear the music evolving with almost every track - laying the ground work for the next masterpieces to follow. My favorites from this one are Walk In The Shadows, I Dream In Infrared, The Killing Words, Neue Regal, London, and I Will Remember."
5,RAGE FOR ORDER!!!!!!!!!,"One of the best metal albums ( epic albums ever. ) Queensryche is so talanted and tight that you will listen to this cd until you wear it out. I still can't get enough of it and I bought it on album when it first came out. Yes, I am a big fan of the Ryche."
5,Ahead of it's time....,"First of all, I'm not sure why their image on this album makes people think of typical glam. They were going for a goth look and if you remember the 'Gonna Get Close To You' video, it was a nice touch for them and for the overall tone of the album. This was not meant to be a commercial, radio friendly glam CD.'Rage For Order' is definitely the most progressive album by Queensryche. It should've been the album to come out after 'Empire'. It was darker, electronic sequences found their way into the sound and it's political and social lyrics would've been perfect for the alt/grunge/industrial movement, more than 'Promised Land'.Truly one of Queensryche's finest releases and an overlooked gem from their best years."
3,Great fun--some flaws,"This is the first game that has every attempted having hand-to-hand combat as well as shooting. So far, the product is amazing. The fighting is awesome, there are tons of combos and power moves, and it's very, very easy to learn. That said, there were a few flaws for this game. First, because this game was released on both consoles and the PC, there are fixed save points. That in itself is not that bad, but the save points are very spread out. Another thing is the game is told in anime form. This means that the acting is pretty cheap, and the plot doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But don't play this game for the plot. Play it for the fighting. The camera control can be kind of iffy sometimes, because a guy can sneak up behind you and you wouldn't know it. Also, the levels look a lot a like, you'll take full advantage of your compass."
2,Great fighting sequences but lacking overall.,"This game is really cool when there are enemies to fight,dynamics are amazing,but most of the time is spent running around opening doors,pulling switchs or activating computers.The plot is very confused as to what your missions are and there is not any variety in the game. Graphics are blocky and all the misssions look the same as do most of the characters in the game,the save game makes you repeat a lot of gameplay and there is no way to remap the keys.Control of your character would be much improved if you could remap the keys,default keys are to far apart and untuitive for fast paced action.On the plus side sound is okay and there are quite a few fighting moves which have been obviously been copied from the Matrix. Final word buy this game for the fights but you will get bored after about 1 hr of play."
1,Nothing but Hype,"Do not waste your money. Like many before, I agree the game had some amazing fighting and great Character Animation. But other than that the game play is absolutely TERRIBLE. The worst thing about this game is the environment. Other than running around in a box with some Half Life style crates the environments were completely empty, and boring. BADDDDDDD ART DIRECTION!"
4,good enough for me,"Well, the graphics are decent, and the gameplay is great. Since when I play a game the thing I notice the most is the gameplay, I really enjoy this game, lot's of moves, combos and stuff which are fairly easy to pull of. The gun's are cool, although you will probably find fighting hand to hand much more fun. My problem, as most have said, is the press switch, open door routine. I don't have much of a problem with the save scheme, since I find that I enjoy a game the most when I run through, risking it all and not saving before every door I'm going through.I don't know what people talk about when they say it is hard to use the the weapons. I find it pretty simple. Move the mouse over the bad guy, press the left mouse buton, and.... that's it.Well, those were my two cents."
3,Good game.... but lacks good graphics in certain areas......,"I've only played the first 3 levels of ONI. The game's gameplay, sound and music are very good, the only thing where they could have a done a better job with little effort was the graphics...... The Character animation in ONI is not so great.... in cutscenes, the characters are just standing still with no face expressions or moving parts like the mouth or the eyelashes...... maybe I'm being picky.... but these little things make watching cutscenes a lot more fun........ still, the game is fun and worth playing...."
2,"Cool game, but tough to learn","I've played a LOT of games, but this one is complicated to learn all the features and commands in order to execute smoothly. The game also lacks some better graphics in areas you'd expect. PASS on this one!"
1,$20 at farmandfleet.com,"Let me just start by saying that I am such a frequent shopper at amazon.com that I have the amazon.com credit card and kindle. But, I like to do my research to make sure that I am not getting ripped off. Well, this is a RIP-OFF!!!I found this exact same item at farmandfleet.com for $20, including shipping.I think amazon.com needs to regulate their prices somehow in order to keep their customers."
5,"Sad but insightful - hard to put down, like it or not!","I was shocked by parts of this detailed, sometimes graphic biography, disturbed by other parts of it, and very moved by other parts of it. I was fascinated by all of it, however, and ended up feeling as if I had lived it right along with poor Mr. Perkins! - who was clearly an intelligent, conflicted, loving, cruel, insecure, proud, scared, brave man - full of contradictions! A character greater tha any he ever played! No whitewash, this. Neither is it a hatchet job though. If honesty is your guide in life, then here is one very balanced, brutally frank book. I found it deeply compassionate. How happy I am that I found it at all! Happy reading all!"
1,Split Image-Awful!,The worst bio I've ever read. Parts of it are as unbelievable as Kitty Kelley's worst works. Author reaches conclusions about Mr. Perkins' life that completely contradict the evidence the author himself presents. A ridiculous waste of time.
1,"A Talented Man Who Had It All, and Threw It Away...","I have to say that of all the books I have read in my life, this is the only book I ever wished I hadn't read! I loved Tony Perkins, especially in ""Friendly Persuasion"", but after reading of the life he led, I was sickened. I knew he was gay, and I didn't care, but the detail in this book was nauseating. If this is what it means to be gay, then what is the big attraction? It seems worse to me than drug addiction or the depths of alcoholism. A life possessed by debauchery. I am very sorry you don't have a rating to fit this terrible book."
1,This is NOT the latest edition of this book!,"I don't know why Amazon has not corrected this - when you type in ""ANTHONY PERKINS"" you get ""SPLIT IMAGE"" - not ""ANTHONY PERKINS."" I don't get it.Plus this edition is out of print - and out-of-date.There is a NEW 10th ANNIVERSARY EDITION, revised and updated, that just came out in May 2006 - titled ""ANTHONY PERKINS: SPLIT IMAGE.""That is the best edition of this book.Do not buy this old edition.Sincerely,Charles Winecoff, the author"
1,Don't waste your money,"Forget this one. Unlike the Panic Mouse, (TONS more fun), this one just goes round and round in a circle- and it's hard to adjust the speed. Sounded like a great time, but seriously, the cats were bored in a minute. A real yawn."
1,Lousy pet toy,"My cats did not use this toy. I don't quite understand the theory behind it, and my cats apparently don't understand it either. The arm rotates around slowly and the balls just kind of roll around inside their ""cheese holes"".The balls don't pop up high enough for the cats to attempt to ""catch"" them. I found it a big waste of money and I wish I had sent it back for a refund. Instead it eventually found its way to the recycling bin. My cats enjoyed the Undercover Mouse much better."
2,not great,the toy is OK but my cats don't really like it because the arm hits them in the face every time they go to look in the cheese. And when I take the arm off they are not too interested.
2,An OK toy,"With more than a few cats, I was surprised and disappointed to find that the cats did not care for this toy. The marbles that roll around inside the top are loud...which scares the cats. So we took them out and they were not impressed with the rotating feather wand. These were adult cats and not kittens, so, kittens may like the toy better. Panic Mouse is our most successful and played with toy....it is unbeatable. Thanks!"
1,disappointed:(,I bought this a couple years ago and loved it but the new one just doesn't seem to have the same effect.
3,"Pretty good read, just wished it was longer","When navy nurse Alison Karaus is about to spend six months at sea and she needs her sister Shana to watch her daughter Jazmine while she is gone. Shana has just moved to a new town and bought a new business and she isn't sure she can handle Jazmine, but Alison says that Jazmine's ""uncle"" Lt. Commander Adam Kennedy is near and will be on hand to help. Shana is not looking for love, but it seem that Lt. Commander Kennedy has worked his way into Shana's heart.""Navy Husband"" is a pretty good book by Debbie Macomber. But I would have liked if it had been longer. The whole story seemed rushed and lacked character development. Overall I liked it, but it could have been so much more if it was longer."
4,Navy Husband,"It was a pretty good story and a quick read. However, it was so completely predictable. This book isn't one of my favorite ones by this author, but it's a feel good and it's a clean book with some chic fluff."
5,Great Read,This was my first kindle book purchase and my first Debbie Maccomber book. I LOVED it. After a stressfull holiday season what a treat to curl up with a great romance novel. I will be buying more of Debbies Books. This is a great read for someone who just wants a light hearted story that has a happy fairy tale ending.
4,Worth a Detour,"A fascinating view of the literary world as seen by a leading Russian emigre poet. Some of the essays (like the long dissection of an elegy by Marina Tsvetaeva) are so dense as to be almost unreadable. The equally long dissection of ""September 1, 1939"" by Auden,though, is like auditing a brilliant university lecture on contemporary British poetry. The paeans to Leningrad and to Brodsky's parents give a gritty feel of life in Soviet Russia. The book gives unexpected rewards, and is worth perseverin"
5,The third and as solid as their first two,"Out of all the Wasp albums I gave the first four releases each five stars- Headless Children got four and the rest are all dissapointing.This is the Wasp album that most frequently is in my cd player- and every song is great. No filler- songs like Mantronic, Sweet Cheatah, and Restless Gypsy are what metal is about. No politics, whining, or sappy love ballads, just music that brings back the good times- when music was about sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Thanks Blackie.Get the re-issue as it has the classic ""Douchebag Blues"""
2,tractor protection,"This was had to put together, doors keep coming off and with the lawn tractor inside its hard to get in and out."
3,Storage Shed,"I have mixed feelings about this shed. The instructions are sorely lacking in clarity, my daughter, who is an engineer by profession, and I had to several ""put together and the take it apart"" actions because of the instructions. It seems well constructed and has not leaked during rain storms where the rain came straight down, what happens with a driving rain will have to bee seen as there are plenty of gaps for rain or snow to enter when driven by the wind. As time progresses, I will elaborate on the water/snow proofness of this shed."
1,Would never buy it again,"The moldings where bad and had to send for missing and bad parts twice. Suncast was quick with replacing parts, but it took over a week each time.The shed took over 3 weeks to complete.Save yourself some time and trouble, go with a different company."
4,Scariest B-movie out there.,"This has to be the scariest and best low budget, B-movie horror flick of all time. It starts out a bit slow, with some silly paintball action and sophomoric banter, but gets off and running quickly enough when they start their ride through the woods and one of them thinks they see a girl running amongst the trees. Later, the boys come across an empty house. They witness an unknown female getting murdered on the TV in the barn, knowing that it was filmed in the very spot they stood, just minutes before they got there. It's one of the most original and scary sequences in any horror film I've ever seen. Lots of other truly frightening scenes in this one.Having watched countless horror films in my day, there are very few that actually creep me out, but this is one of them. I remember renting it back in the late 80's and being completely surprised at what I saw. A true cult classic, The Zero Boys is well worth adding to your horror collection."
2,Truly awful,"This is most likely the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen several movies on late-night cable. But at least those movies are good at what they're doing. The creators of The Zero Boys have no idea how to make a competent thriller, and it shows almost immediately. It's not the least bit scary, and if it were, it wouldn't matter because we don't care about any of the characters. Jared Moses as Rip is the only decent actor in the bunch, so you just know they gave him the smallest role. Kelli Maroney, in particular, is laughably bad. No wonder you haven't seen any of this movie's main players anywhere else. I say 2 stars, if only for how much fun it is to give this movie the MST3K treatment."
3,AN UNEXPECTED QUALITY THRILLER.,"I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST WATCHED THIS MOVIE TEN YEARS AGO WHEN IT CAME OUT.THE DESCRIPTION ON THE BOX JUST MADE IT SOUND LIKE A DESCENT ACTION FLIK.BUT WHEN I WAS FINISHED WATCHING IT .THE ZERO BOYS TURNED OUT TO BE ONE OF THE COOLEST HORROR FLIKS THAT YEAR AND ONE OF MY FAVORITE B MOVIES OF ALL TIME.IT STARTS OUT WITH A GROUP OF WEEKEND WARRIORS WHO CANT SEEM TO EVER WIN AT PAINTBALL. AND WHEN THEY FINALLY DO THEY TAKE A VACATION WITH THEIR GIRLFRIENDS ONLY TO RUN INTO REAL LIFE SURVIVAL AND TERROR.IT'S NOT THE MOST EMACULATE STORY LINE BUT HAS GREAT SCENARY, GOOD SPECIAL EFFECTS,DESCENT ACTING,AND SUSPENSE.THIS MOVIE HAS ITS OWN STYLE AND THE ONLY THING I COMPARE IT TO IS A CROSS BETWEEN DANGEROUSLY CLOSE AND FIDAY THE 13th PART 2.I RECOMMEND IT WITH MY OWN PERSONAL 2 HORNED HAIL."
3,GOOD AND BAD,"This is another DVD Nico Mastorakis has ""remastered"" and put in his ""2003 Collection."" The image and sound quality is good. Others have mentioned different versions. The newest(and best?) has ""2003 Collection"" near the title on the cover. The acting in this film is generally bad with exceptions. The the story is generally good with exceptions. The ending did suprise me.Mastorakis's modus operandi is to make films that are not garbage but are not great. One last caveat. This DVD is not worth the Amazon price. You can pick this up from other vendors for 2/3 the price."
5,Great to grow up with Pinkwater,"As a wee child, I loved ""The Big Orange Splot"". As a youngster, I loved ""Fat Men From Space"". As a slightly older child, I loved ""Lizard Music"" and all the rest. And now I can enjoy all of those books, as well as Pinkwater's short-story collections. It's great to see this stuff back in print. I hope the trend continues...I'd love to see new editions of ""Lizard Music"", ""The Worms of Kukumlima"", and ""Wingman""."
4,Always Marvellous,"This is a beautifully made, effortless-seeming collection of underwater fantasies and studies - I loved Water Dance. I'm not sure I'm with him on the makeup. But as playful/sirenesque/naiad photos it is the tops."
5,Unearthly,"With production values like a Hollywood movie, this book still manages to be intimate, and at the same time, otherworldly and unattainable. More technically accomplished and more luxurious compared to ""Water Dance"" (although the latter is also a must-have), I can pour over this book time and again, and find another detail or expression to seduce me."
4,Good for a compact binocular,Overall it does what it is supposed to do. Compact size is a plus. The only complaint is the view gets dim when you zoom in a cloudy day.
1,Olympus Tracker 10-30x25 Binoculars,"These binoculars were inexpensive, but you are better off spending some more money, and getting something good; this product is really junk and shouldn't have the good name of Olympus on them."
3,Not recommended as one's primary resource to learn Spanish,"There are pictures with the corresponding Spanish definition but the literal English translation is not included. I find this to be a bit challenging for some of the items as there can be multiple English words referring to a single object and without the exact English translation you aren't sure. For example, there is a picture of a 3 drawer dresser defined as comoda. In English this could be nightstand, dresser, bureau... Also some of the pictures are difficult to distinguish. One page has a picture of a sheet and of a pillow and they look almost identical."
4,Interesting....,"I bought this album again after many years of having it - and appreciating the music. It transfers well to CD. This was really the last of Liza's great musical performances - before everything started to go downhill for her - and the same holds true on the film soundtrack - you can hear her still riding her peak - from the success of 'Cabaret' five years prior. It's nice to hear her do these classic numbers which of course suit her voice beautifully.It's a random soundtrack in some ways... in the sense that it means more if you know the film, and the story. However, i feel it a necessary part of my Liza collection, and enjoy listening to it still :-)"
3,Rocket,"This was a gift for our nephew. It was supposed to arrive before Christmas, but did not. We contacted the company and they were helpful about making sure the package was delivered. When they could not track the first package, they sent out another. I would buy from them again because they made sure their product was delivered."
5,Exactly what I needed,"The item was exactly what I needed. I didn't expect to pay so much shipping for an o-ring, when it was ordered with a large order of filters, so I probably won't order it online in the future, but it is just what I wanted. The shipping was timely. Thank you."
2,keys are too soft,"My complaint about this calculator is that the keys on my model are too soft. I'd prefer something a little more ""clicky"" with more tactile feedback so that you can tell when you've pressed a key. As it is, there's no tactile way to feel when you've entered a number and I always have to be careful to make sure I've actually entered the numbers I think I have."
5,Great little calculator,The calculator is the perfect size. The numbers are not too large but your are able to use them with ease and the large screen is user friendly!
2,Be aware...,"I just purchased 2 Casio SL-200TE calculators. Be aware that the input sequence for this model is different from other simple calculators. Example: input 100, press +, inpur 10, press percent. Answer: 110. This is the usual sequence for all other simple calculators I have including the Casio SL-100L. The answer from the SL-200TE is 111.1111. The sequence for SL-200TE is: input 100, press X, input 10, press %, press +. Answer 110. Casio tech support's explanation was that the SL-200TE is programmed differently. No mention of this appears on the instruction page. I was hoping that the SL-200TE was just a larger version of the SL-100L but it appears to have a different logic chip. It isn't worth the effort for me to deal with them or to return them. Off to the yard sale."
2,Basically just a calculator,Basically all this is ... is a plain old calculator...too big to carry in your purse. I would have sent it back but it wasn't worth paying the return postage.
2,Not Very Useful,"Looking at this product's picture it appears that the top hinged part can be used in an upright position. This is mis-leading. When you open it and flip the top up, it is designed to lay back in a flat position. It seems designed to use on a flat surface more than a hand-held type of calculator. It is about 4-3/4"" wide so I can only hold it on its side, not fully grasp it. It is, however, a very attractive calculator with an elegant silver case. Very attractive for a woman's use, or handsome for a man's use. The keys are very soft and responsive. The readout is very large and easy to read. Overall it's a beautiful product, but not terribly functional as a hand-held calculator."
4,Beautifully Haunting...,"""Cold House"" has a nice blend of many of T.M. Wright's strengths... creepy atmosphere, all-too-human characters, and an unraveling past that binds them all together. The writing, without question, is simply outstanding. However, I didn't feel as connected to this story as I did with ""Sleepeasy"" or ""The House on Orchid Street"", but ""Cold House"" is still well worth the experience."
4,Piercing the Celuloid Veil: a movie lover's dream,"If you are a movie lover, then you probably love film music, especially the classic scores written by such past giants as Miklos Rosza or present day titan John Williams. Well, if you hunger for more richly orchestrated film-style music, this album will fill the bill very nicely--and there's more where it came from, as Mark Wolfram is a very active contemporary composer.The Sinfonia of London is a top-notch collection of London's best orchestral musicians, and under Mark's direction they give the kind of polished performance you would expect. The music itself covers a wide variety of cinema-influenced styles, all expertly handled by Maestro Wolfram. And the sound quality of the recording is excellent. Break out the popcorn!"
5,Great book,I have read several of Hilton Sutton's books and love the clarity and positive message of Revelation. I have had several of his books and loved them all.
5,Wonderful resource for educators,"I pulled this book off the shelf thinking it was going to be a pedestrian A-B-C type book. It was anything but. Rather, it's a carefully researched and wonderfully written primer to the United States government. My kids read it repeatedly and we took full advantage of the publisher's 27 page ""Teacher's Guide"" that enhances the educational experience. [...]HIGHLY recommended!"
2,Liberal Overtones,"It is imperative for parents to read and discern literature before children do. I give credit to the author for writing a book about deomcracy, but D is for Democracy has subtle liberal undertones (especially in the illustrations). Underneath the surface, the leftist agenda is pushing for Communism...an enemy of Democracy. PARENTS BEWARE! Know what your children are reading. Teach them to love LIBERTY everyday, lest the liberal socialist agenda deceive their minds and continue to pluck away freedom after freedom. Children should long after the American Dream that they can work hard, pursue their dreams, and be whatever they want to be because of the FREEDOM that is unique only to America. Give them the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,With My Rifle By My Side: A Second Amendment Lesson,American Soldier Proud and Free, and great biographies of the Founding Fathers and their families...but please, leave D is for Democracy on the library bookshelf."
4,Love Pixar,"This was adorable, and my grandson laughed out loud while he watched it. You can not go wrong with Pixar."
5,Fun and entertainment!,I loved this short.It's really easy to set amazon video on my PS3. I'm happy with using this service.
3,Good price for UHF,"First off, toss the batteries that come in the package and use new ones. So far, that's one of only two complaints with this product- the other being that the trap door for the battery is wonky, so you have to really pay attention to whether you've secured it, or you'll lose the cover.Beyond those two minor issues, these mics have (so far) proven up to the task of drunken handling in a bar setting for karaoke nights. And, for the price, they are quite sturdy. I also really like the VU meter and large input knobs on the unit."
3,hand held,"This unit works fairly well when you know some of its shortfalls. The sound and range are excellent, but if you hold the microphone too high on the handle, it muffles the sound and causes noises in the system. For the price, it is an excellent choice."
4,Microphone system.,"I bought these mics for the DJ equipment i had, so i could replace using the wired mics. The sound quality is pretty good, except for the fact that is recommended to have both the mics on at the same time even if your only using one. If i only had one mic turned on, the other channel would pick up some distortion and blare through the speakers. It wasn't constant though. It was the occasional rip of static. Overall, they are pretty decent for the price, and the range is really good on them."
1,MicroPhoneGeek,Please stay away from this very low end model since it did not have a decent sound at all - You should be spending just another $100+ for a much higher sound quality.. (or perhaps my 'refurbished' item was defective then I would still recommend against it) - My recommendation is to buy either Audio 2000 as 1st choice and VocoPro as 2nd since they offer great quality but not at real expensive price range
5,Great wireless mics!!,"This is a great duel wireless unit !! I have used it on several gigs now with no issues. We sing duets as street performers and at events, and have even done a wedding. There are tons of channels to choose from. sound is clean and clear. Batteries last a long time in the mics. Easy to keep portable. Stand work well and operate smoothly. They adjust to any height for kids to tall adults. If it were damaged, I would buy it again. Great Job for good wireless mics for a small amount of money."
3,works ok,The microphones work well. However if someone steps in between the microphone and the receiver the microphone cuts out for a moment. It's kind of frustrating when you're trying to make announcements or work the crowd.
3,vhf to uhf wireless mic,"Have vocopro vhf wireless mic system. Thought upgrade to uhf would be better. Not so, more drop out and eats aa batteries(2nd unit). Maybe just this product. Thinking of staying w/ vhf."
1,useless microphone,"""If I could put 0 stars I would do it""Purchased this and kept it in the case (my mistake) and opened until Christmas 2011 2 months later just to find out it doesn't work it constantly drops out even at less than 5 feet from the receiver tried new duracell batteries and the problem continuedif you are tempted to buy it based on the reviews (as I did) I recommend you to use it immediately that way if your product doesn't work you can return it.Unfortunatelly for my it was too late and amazon didn't accept the return..."
2,One mic doesn't work,I wish I would have shelled out the money for a more durable setup. I can't get one of the pair to work. It cuts in and out.
1,No Luck,"Let me preface this with the fact that I've installed noise filters in many vehicles, so I do know what I'm doing. My experience has been that a significant number of filters are faulty right out of the box - and in this case, both of the Scosche ones I purchased did not work. Considering how cheap these were, I simply consider it a small price to pay to learn to avoid this brand."
1,this is crap,"This is piece of crap and didn't help at all!My setup: Volvo 245DL, Pioneer Stereo, Kenwood kac-8405 amp, 2 polk audio 6.5"" and 2 polk audio 4"""
5,Excellent LCD TV ...,"Very Good Image ....Auto was up colors ....But I recommend that everybody connect this LCD TV in a source voltage regulator, Because This TV is very sensitive to electrostatic discharges, doing this we will be ensuring the life of LCD TV ..In Another words....I connect my PS3 with the HDMI cable, and the PS3 recognized a range of resolusion from 480p to 1080i, although it is 720p, I do not want me to imagine how it is the 1080p resolusion. ;)My seller was teach for less .. everything came good friends ... thank you very much."
4,Shopping center income and expenses,"This is a great book for people who need to analyze shopping centers (I'm an appraiser). However, I believe there will be a new addition of this book out in 2006."
3,Not as good as the original - No Squeaker!,"While I love Eric Carle's words and illustrations, this board book is not as good as the hardcover edition. Yes, the story is exactly the same, but the font in this book is quite small, so it might be harder for some people to see/read. The biggest disappointment for me, though, was the lack of the squeaky rubber duck at the end. We have board book versions of other Eric Carle books, and they still have their ""special"" last page: ""The Very Quiet Cricket"" board book still makes noise; ""The Lonely Firefly"" board book still lights up... I could have sworn we even had a board book version of this in the past that had a thicker final page and still had the rubber duck embedded, but this one does not. It just doesn't even feel like the same book without that added element. If I had known there was no squeaker in this one, I wouldn't have bought it for my niece. If I had to sum up my experience in one word, it would be ""disappointment."""
4,Some changes from the paper edition,"We've been waiting and waiting for this book to come out in a boardbook edition.It is a favorite of my children, but one is very young, and has accidentally ripped some pages in other books.My first complaint is that the type seems kind of small, relative to other boardbooks by Mr. Carle and compared to the original version.However, my biggest disappointment came with the surprise at the end.I won't spoil it for everyone, but the format is ""different"" than in the original. It is cuter, and likely longer lasting, but it is a little more difficult to get it to work than the simpler mechanism in the paper book.I'd *strongly* suggest that you look at one of these in person before purchasing it ...I'm quite disappointed, but we have it now and the kids certainly love it!"
5,Another great Eric Carle book!,"For those who collect Eric Carle's books for children or anyone who loves great children's picture books....10 Little Rubber Ducks is so cute and my one year old loves the ""squeak"" at the end. For teachers, it is perfect for numbers, counting, etc.Highly recommended!!!"
5,Great book!,"I love Eric Carle books - and so, do my son, daughter-in-law and grand-baby. This is a board book - I actually send her a hardcover paper coy of this book for Christmas. But, Adi needs to be able to hold the book and turn the pages herself. So, this book is for now, the other will be for her as she gets older!"
4,summer reading,"my son had to read this for school, summer reading before he started kindergarten. was read once before he entered k, never again. great effort by the author"
5,10 Little Rubber Ducks,"This book was purchased to assist special needs children with counting and the sound ""d"" identification. It works great for the job!"
4,Precious and informative,"True to Eric Carle's formula, the illustrations are his paper collage art, and the story resolves the story for one of the little ducks happily. There is also a lesson here about what happens to items that end up in the ocean on their transit from another country, creating awareness of ocean pollution being more than oil."
4,"A book worth reading, not for the fainted heart","A book mixing a variety of topics on the hot subject of child labor, it combines all the right elements to attract the reader. Though the lengh of the book is a little long its great ideas and intriguing subject keep you reading. This is an enjoyable book to read on a lazy day."
5,Isha's Facets,Isha's facets are magical. They are extraordinary healing tools that serve as a catalyst to get on with your life's calling.
5,picture perfect,"I found this book in the giftshop at the Sioux Falls airport in South Dakota. As a woman who grew up On the Plains, I found that Brown's photographs captured the true essence of the beauty one finds there. It's not simply a collection of ""postcard"" photographs of abandoned windmills, lonely pastures, and fragile pasque flowers. The photos depict the ""real"" plains, complete with its people and its architecture. Norris' introduction is, as I had anticipated, an enjoyable complement to the photos. This is a lovely book to share with people who appreciate the beauty of the Great Plains."
3,Not for those with close eye spacing,"I am a 5'4"" woman and I am not able to adjust the eye spacing to my eyes. I do believe I have eyes that are closer together than the average. But my 15 year old Nikon binoculars adjust to me. These would not work for young children or people with closely spaced eyes."
4,Variety Revisited,"For those who remember the 50s, when entertainment was entertainment. Great for Eartha Kitt lovers."
3,Better ... but still disappointing.,"Why has New Faces not been given a 16x9 transfer? It's pretty sharp, and the colour is much better than last time, but why the inferior 4x3 transfer?"
3,Reasonably Decent Restoration,"While in high school I saw a sneak preview of this film and I have wanted a decent copy for years. This is OK and will be very entertaining for Eartha Kitt fans. There is a disclaimer that some of the film has deteriorated. Since it is a specialist's item, I suppose this will be as good a restoration as is likely to be available. It is better than the VHS so if it brings back memories to you, buy it. It is perfectly watchable."
3,Disappointing transfer of film.,"VCI's release is the best looking this film has ever been on DVD. However, released in widescreen the print is not anamorphic, so the image is on the small side looking more like a windowbox than letterbox which spoiled it for me. I have a 52"" Tv, but someone with a small screen will not be satisfied at all. As for the film itself, I loved most of the musical numbers but the comedy skits seem a bit dated."
4,Interesting,"The question: How can angsty industrial music, old-school grunge music, and indie-rock combine to please the dissillusioned youth of pop culture? Answer: Fly. Despite the monotony that comes with being an angst ridden rock band, Fly pulls through to make a magnificent debut album. You can tell that these guys have been fed the beef stew of drunken grunge stars and love-haters their entire life. You hear Soundgarden in their progressions, as well as NIN. It's high time old-core rock got a new headliner, and Fly could be the guys who lead the movement."
2,I guess this would be great if you were a stoner.,"I just listened to the first few songs that were highlighted here and I didn't care for this much. I was looking for a band called Bombthreat, but I listened to this anyway and it is a sort of slow and dopey mix. Sort of like some old Jane's Addiction second side of the tape stuff."
5,Superb book,"I got it in good condition and in the time stated. The book is excellent.I love Harold Dull and his consciousness and work. I am sorry I only got to meet his wife, years ago at Harbin, during her first pregnancy. All the best to you."
4,A Valuable Addition to Your Desk,"This is a good book to keep by your desk, whether you are a veteran trader, a journalist or a novice in the financial markets. The author has done an outstanding job of presenting definitions many of us knew but had forgotten through misuse, as well as adding new ones that have crept recently into the changing marketplace. Well worth getting your hands on one!"
5,Very thorough,This is a very thorough dictionary that makes it quick to find the meaning of obscure financial terms. A great reference.
1,Sucky Suction,"My 11 month old was able to pull the bowl off the tray in about 30 seconds. Trust me, I wet the bottom of the suction cup, made sure it was securly attached to the bowl, etc. Bottom Line: the suction really isn't great and it's just not worth the money (no matter how cute they are)."
2,suction cup is useless,"i wish i had read the reviews before purchasing this bowl, because the suction cup doesn't work at all. i had chosen this adorable set to celebrate my 17 month old learning to use a fork & spoon. she still needs for the bowl to stay in one place however, so the suction is key...this is a disappointment. very cute, but probably too small to use for a child past the suction bowl stage."
2,"cute, but not functional","I bought this thinking that my 11 month old daughter wouldn't be able to move the bowl with the suction cup. WRONG! She pulled it right off the high chair. I tried it several more times, wet, dry, nothing worked. She also can peel up the suction part. Sigh....but it's really cute, and didn't break or chip when she threw it on the floor..."
3,Cute small bowl,"The bowl is cute. I did not try the suction yet b/c my baby hasn't started feeding herself yet. I took off the suction part and just use the bowl. It is a lot smaller than I expected. It is kind of pricey for such a small bowl. It is cute, but I wouldn't buy it again."
3,"Bowl is beautiful, but...",The bowl is really nice and sturdy but the suction doesn't work very well. It does not stay put. But the suction piece comes off so it can just be used as a nice bowl.
1,suspicious reviews,"I think some of these reviews are written by people affiliated with the company that sells the product, Touch of Europe."
5,Kept Me Glued,"I loved Belle Teal! Although it deals with mildly heavy subjects, it really shows them through the eyes of an innocent girl.Belle Teal Harper is in the fifth grade. She meets a disliked African-American boy who becomes friends with her. However, one of her best friends has troubles with the boy, ending up in a serious fight.This book kept my eyes glued to the page. This is a refreshing, fast-paced book that recaps how horrible racism is."
5,Race relations for pre-teens,"I was always a fan of Ann M Martin. I really loved Bummer Summer and her other novels long before the Baby-Sitters Club (but I read about 50 of those=). So I picked this up for sentimental reasons at the book fair at the school where I teach.I was so impressed by the caliber of writing here. Martin realy captured the voice of a rural southern girl in the 1950s! The cadence rang true and was clear and honest.I thought the story of rcaial tension in a newly segrated school was handled beautifully and might make children that age (5th grade) really think about prejudice and beliefs.It was poignant, funny, sad. Just a great story. I wish that it hadn't ended with the school Christmas pageant- I want to know how the rest of the year finished up!This is well worth reading- for all ages!"
2,Beat Up,This book is pretty basic and wasn't what I expected - not as helpful to poets as it would be to beginning college students. It was not in clean condition and arrived with a torn cover.
3,"I hate the baby-talk and poor grammar, but the kids love it","It's the old debate over encouraging kids to read garbage or to read nothing at all. The stories are funny, but the poor grammar makes me cringe. In my experience, kids read them just because ""everyone else is reading them."" Young female readers often read Junie B Jones as their first ""chapter book"" series. It's a feather in a first-grader's cap to read a chapter book, even if it is filled with baby-talk."
5,Junie B. Jones Smells Something Fishy,It's pet day in Junie B.'s school and she is very excited.Junie B. is very funny because she is a kindergartener. I gave this book five stars. I want to read more Junie B.books.
3,Junie B. Jones has a pet day problem!,"Junie B. Jones is both upset and angry about Pet Day in Room Nine. On Pet Day, you can bring in your pet--unless it's a dog or cat. Unfortunately for Junie B., she has a dog and can't bring it in. Now she must get a good pet to bring in before the big day. However, Junie B.'s idea of a good pet to bring in is a racoon and dead fish!This Junie B. Jones book was just ""okay."" Nothing wonderful, nothing terrible. In most of the Junie B. Jones books, there's humor on every page. In this one, there was just a little humor in every chapter. However, I really loved the surprise ending. There's no way I could have seen that coming!"
2,Audiotape version,"I found the audiotape version of this book to be disappointing. I enjoyed the plot of the book and the fact that it is abridged probably cut down on the highly technical details that the reviewers of the hardcover version found difficult or too involved. However, this version also leaves out any Donovan reference and no author's note that many found interesting.Further, the narrator's style did not fit with the characters, at least not as I had envisioned them. In many ways, I felt as if she were a kindergarten teacher trying to do different voices for different characters and exaggerated too much. I will wait until the book comes out in paperback to fill in the missing pieces."
2,Not Her Best,"Elizabeth Lowell has the ability to write FANTASTIC novels and this one just wasn't one of them... I mean, it was slow and dragged for about 200 pages. Not worth the price you pay for it... borrow it from the library!"
4,Good...but I hope there's more,"Elizabeth Lowell did an impeccable job in combining two stories into one incredible book. Everyone wants to believe in destiny and the existence of a true soul mate transcending the bonds of time. Also, if you have read Untamed, Forbidden, and Enchanted, this book is even more intriguing. I had hoped, though, that there would be more to the story of Erik the Learned and Serena of the Silverfells. I hope Ms. Lowell is planning on giving them their own book, as they deserve, since the story of their relationship is is scarce in Moving Target. I also hope the cameo appearance of the Donovans also signals the continuation of the family story. Not much is said of Lawe and Justin in her previous books. All of these brief mentions and no full explanations make me anxious for her next novel. Overall, her writing was as excellent as always and a joy to read. If you've never read any of her books before, this is certainly a good time to start."
2,What happened???,"After waiting years, i finally got to read Eric the Undefeated's story and I was so upset! It was a good story, but I did want to see Eric fall in love, and to see him feel the pain of love. We got to see Dominic fall in love with Meg, Simon fall in love with Ariel, and Duncan fall in love with Amber. What about Eric?? Out of all of these couples, i wanted to see the rowan bloom for Eric and i didnt, so needless to say, this is the first time that i have been disappointed in an Elizabeth Lowell book!!"
3,Very technical,"I love Elizabeth Lowell, but her books are getting a little too much technical details for me. I started to get bogged down in the technical aspects of 12th century illuminated manuscripts, thereby missing the plot. The basic story and the romantic suspense are great, but I don't think that the level of detail that she's been putting into her books is meant for the average, intelligent reader. I found this to be the case with other of her more recent works also.If you can overlook all of the technical details of illuminated manuscripts and just concentrate on the plot, this is a good book. If you want to know everything about 12th century illuminated manuscripts this is a great book for you."
2,Moving Target missed its target!,"If you were waiting for Erik and Serena's story then you will be let down. I have waited since Enchanted, for Eriks' story. I was so excited to see this book thinking that it might start off modern, but surely it would go back and tell the story. There were to many characters. There was barely any connection to the original characters. I could careless about the characters in this story. I am really disappointed in this and I think she should have stayed with the historical aspect of the story line. It was hard to follow with so many different characters. To much sub stories that had nothing at all to do with the main story. If you liked Enchanted, Forbidden....Then do yourself a favor and pass on this book."
2,A very forgettable book,"This is the first Elizabeth Lowell book I've read in a long time. I had tired of her books and stopped buying them--all the ""warrior"" stuff was tedious, and they were all minor variations on a theme. I couldn't find anything else I wanted to read, and was marginally intrigued by the plot line, so I shelled out the money for a hardback. Silly me! It was a waste of money and my time. Boring book, boring characters, and the standard, boring Lowell style of writing. In fact, it was so boring that I had forgotten I had read it! Searching for a book, I noticed this title on an end table and picked it up, thinking, ""Oh, I need to finish this book."" As I started leafing through, looking for my bookmark, I realized that I had, in fact, finished the book. It was that forgettable. Don't waste your time or money. Lowell is definitely riding on the few earlier publications that were worthwhile, and this is formula writing at its worst."
2,Why Bother,"This is my first read/listen of this ""author"". My comment: Why would anyone want to read the ""Book of the Learned"" or die for it. Yes I can see the rarity value of such a scroll but I won't fight or die for it.Either there's a backstory here that I don't know or this is weak, weak!"
2,Disappointed!,"I have really enjoyed all of Elizabeth Lowell's contemporary novels, however this one was a huge let down. As a romantic suspense (with a hint of history), the romance was a 1, the suspense a 3 and the details of illuminated manuscripts a boring 1. There was very little romantic chemistry between the lead characters and the only thing that redeemed the book was the slightly interesting (if not tidy) ending."
2,"Big Lowell Fan, but......","After waiting so long to get Erik's story, which was already in place from Enchanted, Forbidden, and Untamed, I am greatly disappointed in Moving Target. Even if this story had not been about a ""re-incarnated"" Erik and Serena, the reading of it was often tedious due to the excessive description of the Learned Pages. The prologue, which immediately grabbed my attention, and had me on the edge of my seat, was not a reflection of the action that took place in the rest of the story. Personally, I feel that Erik, the learned, still has a story that has been left untold."
2,This book is very disappointing,"I have read literally every book that Elizabeth Lowell has written, usually on the first day that they come out and all in one sitting. I am a major fan of her work, but had I not seen her name on the dustcover I never would have guessed that this book was her work. The characters were one-dimensional and I never really got to a point where I cared what happened to them. There was never any explanation of the past history between the original Erick and Serena, nor was the Book of the Learned explained. Characters from other Lowell novels were thrown in but their appearance was not fully explained. For the first time ever with a Lowell book I had to force myself to finish reading, and it took me several days to do it. Since I have always loved Elizabeth Lowell's work I am considering this a little ""bump"" in the road and eagerly awaiting her next work. I just wish it didn't take her a whole year to write each one!"
1,Bait and switch...I am STEAMED!,"Would give this a ZERO if I could! We thought we were getting Erik's story and found out we got SUCKERED into buying something other than tha. What a bummer for all the loyal fans of the Enchanted, Forbidden and Untamed books to find that THIS was the long awaited sequel that told Erik's story. It was HORRIBLE! We ALL feel CHEATED! Actually - I feel better just pretending that Erik's story hasn't been told yet than to think it was this piece of drivel! I'm sorry to say but since EL left those books, the Only series and Autumn Lover/Winter Fire behind - she hasn't written a decent thing that has to do with romance! If you want to write suspense or fiction or whatever RIDICULOUSLY descriptive book you want on jade, pearls, rubies, jems, ancient manuscripts, gold etc., etc. then STOP calling them ROMANCE novels! Move into the suspense genre of fiction and stop using the true romance fans out here to buy your books that don't have a THING to do with romance!"
1,Keep Moving,"Generic old time Harlequin romance with missing art tacked on. Derivative: soup cons of Krantz, Roberts; a line about trailer hitches made classic by Willy Nelson in the movie Electric Horseman; Donovans make a cameo appearance in chapter 19. Dialog out of the back seat of a school bus. When she is good she is very very good, but when she is bad who does she think she's kidding?"
3,ERIK'S STORY,"THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD ONE; I LOVED HOW THE DONOVAN CLAN GOT INTO THIS; AS SOMEBODY ALREADY SAID, DARE WE HOPE THAT LAWE'S STORY IS COMING SOON? WELL, ANYWAY, IT TIES BACK TO HER HISTORICAL SERIS OF ""UNTAMED"", ""FORBIDDEN"",AND ""ENCHANTED"". AND TELLS THE STORY OF ERIK, AMBER'S BROTHER. THE ONE THING I DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THIS, WAS THAT ERIK'S NOVEL WASN'T A HISTORICAL AS THE OTHER EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THAT HE FOUND LOVE, I WANTED TO READ ABOUT THE JOURNEY..."
2,You'll have more fun reading a history book....,"What the HECK was this book about?! I've read it - or tried to -and I have absolutely no clue. I was completely lost by the second chapter when the author began her lecture on 'leaves' and 'illuminations' and yada yada blah blah blah... In Moving Target Lowell goes through lengths in trying to impress the readers on the tiniest and quite boring details ancient manuscripts, the making of them, the forging of them, the making of them again and again and again. Erik and Serena become secondary characters to the boring history lesson. We (the readers) don't get the chance to know or understand Erik and Serena as they're development is hindered by the numerous (insignificant) secondary characters and the constant lectures by the author.All in all, I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book."
2,Book of knowledge dull,I found the heroine and hero weak. I also found the subject matter confusing. No real surprises in this story.
1,Miriam,"I have been waiting for the sequeal to the medieval romance for Eric & Serena, however after reading the reviews I don't believe I have the heart to read what clearly will be a disappointment. PLease consider writing a book during the medieval time, I have kept the triology for 8 years and patiently waiting for the fourth, faithfully devoted reader."
1,"Sadly, a total waste","This book is a total waste of time and money. EL, like other romance authors has insulted her fan base and thumbed her nose at her loyal readers...by going 'mainstream'. I guess what goes around comes around, because instead of the bright spark I've seen in her other works, this books is a dim-bulb.Instead of great writing talent, we get too much information about antiquities, not enough character development, lame 'romance' and yes, I was one of many who wanted to see Eric's story completed. It's the usual, predicatble 'what dunit' and sadly, just is a bore.So, good like EL in seeking your new fan 'base'. I'm outta here."
3,Kept trying to care...,"I love most of the newer Elizabeth Lowell, but I just couldn't get into this story. First, it's not really a romance. It's a thriller/suspense crime novel with a sex scene thrown in with little warning or payoff. I never really got under the skin of the hero, but Risa, the heroine, was fairly interesting. The little psychic twist seemed unnecessary and unconvincing. Still decent crime plot, some funny moments, and better written than most romances."
2,disappointment,"Until this book I have never regretted buying anything by Elizabeth Lowell. She repeatedly introduces new ""characters"" and then just sorta leaves them hanging there. I got no sense that her main characters were actually people. Everyone in this book is one dimensional. The book doesn't end, it just stops."
5,A Romantic Suspense for Intelligent readers,"In an era of overblown, over simplified, artificial conflict, standard plot books, Elizabeth Lowell has once again produced a book about people we want to meet. Erik and Serena manage to overcome a mountain of problems carried over from their personal and far distant past by weaving trust between each other. No space is wasted on childish conflict, the level of sexuality is adult without being blatant. The introduction of a new series framework is intriguing as a background, and promises many more lost hours of sleep. THANK YOU"
2,"Not a very ""fey"" read...","I'm not a reader of Elizabeth Lowell, but the book jacket grabbed me in the airport because of my love of historical fiction and all things Celtic.... I was disappointed, and LOST most of the time... She chose a very obscure and complicated premise (ancient illuminated manuscripts)and, I think, had a difficult time translating all that she had learned in her research into something understandable to the general reading public. I originally was caught up in the chemistry between Erik and Serena, but that, too, got old. And what's with the overuse of the word ""fey""? Is that the word of the week?"
2,Not the Elizabeth Lowell I love to read!,"I was so disappointed with Moving Target. I loved the Untamed, Forbidden, and Enchanted books and always wondered why Erik never got a story of his own. When I found out about this book I was so excited. The book just didn't deliver. The characters were not up to her usual standards and the story was no where near as romantic. I'm hoping this is her only book like this. This is the only book I have ever been diasappointed in by her and I have every other book she has written."
1,Very Disapointing,"I have never been so disappointed in an Elizabeth Lowell book as with Moving Target. I have read all of Mrs. Lowells books and this was an absolute let down and in no way did it even come close to the magical and passionate Enchanted, Forbidden, Untamed or any of her other books for that matter. There was too much talk about vellum this and palimpset that, and blah, blah, blah. There were too many characters and too much annoying banter between the sexes. Next to nothing was revealed about what was actually in ""The Book..."" or who the characters were. Overall there was too much talk, not enough action, virtually no passion, and generally boring with an abrupt ending. I am very sorry I paid the hardcover price for this book."
2,Huh?,"This book could have been a whole lot better. The history of the Book of the Learned was never well-explained, nor was the relationship between the original Erik and Serena. I guess the whole mystical/memory thing between modern Erik and Serena, as well as the importance of the Book as something other than historic art, would have made much more sense to me with a better handling. As it was, neither hero nor heroine were particularly interesting characters. Frankly, Mr. Picky the cat and the afterword about Lowell's trip to Scotland were the best parts of the book.Can we have more Donovans please?"
3,Let Down......,"Having been a fan of Ms. Lowells for many years,I couldn't wait for 'Moving Target' to come out.After reading it,I think this is not one of her best works.There is hardly any spark between the main characters and I was bogged down in all the details. The references to the first Eric and Serena were hard to follow. I felt like I was reading a mystery instead of a romance. Romance is what I think Ms. Lowell does best,but it is sadly lacking in this book. This will not be one that I will read over and over."
1,bad book,"I hated this book. I have read almost all her books and I think this is the worst book. Some of the people appeared in this story were irrelavent, like the Donovans. The action in the book was boring, and slow-paced."
2,Not surprising -- didn't like it.,"Sorry -- I can't recommend this book. I have tried to read Elizabeth Lowell many times, and I just can't get into her books. I find the dialogue between her characters boring and/or corny. Attempts at humor are lost on me, and there is little to no chemistry between the main characters. As if this wasn't bad enough, we have to get a school-type lession on different types of collecting (depending on which book you read -- this one is manuscripts). I don't want to know every detail there is to know about this stuff -- a little info. would be fine. If you are looking for a good read, try any book by Nora Roberts."
2,Sizing is ridiculously small,"I ordered a size larger than usual (33 inch waist and ordered large) and they were still way too small, especially the waist."
1,Well -- not thrilled,The products are individually wrapped they are smaller then the size marked and they shrink after just one washing. No opening in the front for some reason. I definitely would not buy again. Okay if you want a thong.
5,Don't buy it from Amazon.,"I had quite the ordeal getting this book. I ordered it from Warehouse Deals/Amazon and instead of getting 4 Volumes, I got the 4th Volume. Then UPS and I had a bit of a tiff.In the end, I had to order it from India [by the publisher]Just got the book today, and it's GREAT. Nice print, fine pages [even if a bit on the thin side] and from what i can tell, it's well printed. A little dusty and probably used, but it's still in GREAT shape.Highly suggest getting it."
1,WHY ONLY 5 OF THE 15 FILMS ?!,"ESPN Films was in between the first 2 'seasons' of 30 for 30.. so I don't understand why this isn't the complete series...? I doubt they come out with a 2nd & 3rd volume for ESPN Films because I think they only called it 'ESPN Films"" at the time because they weren't certain how 30 for 30 would continue (or something like that) Although I'm glad to see 30 for 30 back, but I'd like to see the ESPN Films Collection complete too."
1,Wont order again,Sent me Earing display cards. wont wast my time or money on this again. since they cant seem to fill an order correctly
5,A Must Read for Adoptive Families/Friends,"I saw this book advertised in Adoptive Families magazine and immediately ordered it. So many of the essays spoke to me even though each detailed experience was different. Stories about domestic adoptions, post adoption depression, international adoption, open adoption, special needs adoption, response of family to the adoption and more are shared in an honest and touching manner. As a mom of 3 boys (2 adopted from China) I could relate to many of the experiences which were written about. Not only did the essays cause me to reflect on experiences our family has already gone through, but provided me with insight on experiences we will very likely face in the future (racism at school, discussions about birth parents, whether to or when to take our children back to the country of birth, teenage identity issues, etc) This book is a must read not only for parents who have or will adopt a child but for their families and friends as well."
4,"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly","This was a wonderful insight into the many approaches to adoption and the many ways in which it happens. The authors in this book did not shrink from telling it like it is from their perspectives, and I appreciated the honesty in which they conveyed their adoption stories. No matter what kind of adoption you're going through, there's something in this book for you."
5,Compelling adoption stories,"This collection of essays covers all aspects of adopting. The stories are very moving, honest and compelling. It covers both international and domestic adoption. It addresses some of the most difficult challenges that adoptive families must face. It is the best adoption book that I have read in YEARS!!"
4,Oh No!! Low on Power!,"Sony's T-665C is an awesome PDA! Downside? So many cool things to do with it that you are liable to run low on power away from homebase sooner or later... (usually at the worst possible time!)With this product this is no longer an issue. AA batteries are available everywhere. I think it is a bit over priced, but the first time it saves your [tail], you won't feel so bad springing for it!"
4,for for me ethics paper,Used this book in a big ethics paper on martial arts in North American capitalism. Got some nice quotes to use and it also helped me gain further historical information about the arts.
5,"Sam invented lounge small ban swing, now he defines it.","Sam's 90's renditions of the old Louie standards are exciting and high entergy arrangements, but they cannot replace the original sounds of the 50""s and 60's. However, his new band arrangements of the ""new music"" is flawless. His new band is fantastic. This combination of the old and the new is priceless. Sam continues to shine. As a 40 year devotee' of Louie, Sam and Keely I have seen many bands and their individual sounds. Aside from the original band this group is by far the best Sam has fielded. Sam is 72 and I hope he continues to age 100, He certainly has not lost anything in horn tenique and command and his voice is so much more on target. His appreciation for changing times rooted in the basics of yesterday make a great sound and a pleasurealble listening experience. Keep'im coming, Sam."
4,Great,Everything Was great .. i even bought a book about indigo children :) .What i did not like though is the fact that they see dead people and that is something can never happen.
2,Well Intentioned garbage....,"This was an attempt to bring the Indigo Children into mainstream awareness and without having read the other reveiws, I can say that for myself, I was very disappointed by this film. It relies on Old Paradigms in order to describe the New Paradigms. This was so 'formula'....'Hollywood' that the real power of these children was trivialized and contrived.So much potential wasted. Sad. I don't know if it was a lack of money, focus, or pure intention...but so much was lost here.Hoping for a better attempt later by another team."
1,Soooo disappointing!,I am a mother of an indigo and crystal child and i was so looking forward to a movie about them that would educate the public and validate what i was going thru and this was just horrendous. i was embarassed that i dragged my mother to see it with me. i was hoping there would be some enlightenment about how every day indigos struggle at home and especially in school and out in suburbia. it was just plain terrible.
4,Indigo,"this movie shows us a lot of how we as a people seem to ignore the little things that children seem to know. I found the movie very enlighting because I see the same things in my child as they showed within the movie, How she seems to know thinigs that most of us have forgotten or how just by being next to you when you are feeling sick seems to make one feel better and even better the next day. I would recomend this movie to anyone who see things with thier child that most belive not to be reality."
2,"Nice topic, poor story and presentation.","I saw this movie in a local church not very long ago, and was hoping to have seen a documentary about the indigo children. What I saw was a poorly strung together and acted out drama about an indigo. Nobody attemps to explain anything about the children except that they seem to have something special happening around them. The fact that child can predict things in the future and knows things that she ""shouldn't,"" is about all that you get from this movie. I wanted information on the subject, not some soap opera story with soap opera rate actors."
3,Indigo,It wasnot what I thought it would be. I had a different idea of what Indigo children were. I'm glaed I say the video though because now I know. I thought some Indigo children were Autistic.
1,Pathetic attempt at a movie to explain the Indigo Phenom,This movie that is supposed to be about Indigo Children is very poorly acted and goes way overboard with the metaphysical abilities that are not entirely apart of the Indigo spectrum.
1,maybe next time...,"I am a fan of Neale, but this movie is completely baffling as to what they are trying to say.. it was painful to watch honestly.. I was cringing with embarrassment for NDW ..oops ! ..we (5 of us )as a group were VERY excited to drive two hours to see it being that we have done much work on the subject with Drunvalo (wonderful video) and others..but this story never got past an annoying and rude ""indigo"" brat and NDW toting a gun around with children in hand .. huh ?? these positive reviews can't have much to do with the actual movie, that's for sure ! Nice try anyway.. If you want to be inspired to make a better movie, check this one out. love y'all !!oxo"
1,A bad Hallmark card!,"Sooo disappointing, if not infuriating if you've ever met an indigo child. This piece is not much better than a watered-down, made for TV, Lifetime for women, movie-soap opera. It's cutesy & unrealistic. The child, the teenagers and a lot of the other acting is 2-dimensional and cliche-ridden. It's like watching a bad adaptation of a really good, important story. Indigos deserve better PR than this, not some saccharine, Disneyesque, moralizing, preachy infomercial of a film. Granted, it's difficult to present the reality of spirituality in this new millenium, but this does no justice to the real lives of Indigo children."
2,"Poor script, poor acting","This film was a huge disappointment. The actors that I work with in community theater are better actors than the ones in this movie. I'm not a spiritual person, and was not at all familiar with the indigo children concept. The movie Indigo certainly made the concept laughable.If the intent of the film was to introduce people to the idea of Indigo children, it failed. If the intent of the film was to entertain, it also failed."
2,Disconnected,"Wonderful idea, great team work, good intention, but not quite enough. I had hoped for a broader educational tool, something to help support the parents & families involved with these children. The story was stilted and 'not real'. The connection of these children was glossed over. The film left me concerned about exploitation of these kids and also about unrealistic expectations. Neale's best gift is writing, not acting. It ultimately left me disappointed and angry."
1,Not happy about it.,"I purchased the Haier Dehumidifier model HDN655E a year ago.I started to have problems with the switch that resets the unit after the water tank has been emptied and replaced,I recently set up a system so I did not have to carry the water upstairs to empty. When I attached the drain hose, per the instuctions, I found that the water did not drain out the hose, it continued to fill the built in water tank. I still have to empty the tank and fight the reset switch.This was my first unit. I have looked at other dehumidifiers and find others offer better systems to drain the water, the water tanks do not have to be emptied manually.I would not recommend this unit. The reset switch is getting harder to manually reset, (replacing the water tank won't reset it,) and I don't expect it to work much longer."
1,Worked for 5 minutes,"Bought this and when arrived home unpacked it and turned it on. It was loud when on high, really loud but that is not a real big deal to me for what I needed it for. While it was running it just shut off. It never came back on after that, it was dead. I checked my breaker as the manual suggested and the customer service lady advised. I will add it was easy to get someone on the phone. So never the less she told me it was a fluke. I checked it one more time in the morning just in case it fixed itself...you never know but still dead as a door nail. So I packed it up and returned it to the place whose returns are from 7:00am to 10:00pm....you could maybe guess where with that info.One more was in stock and it was obvious that it had been returned due to the open box and the adhesive tape removed from the top and back. So in the end I chose not to get this particular brand."
1,loud and doesn't stop,"This unit does extract the humidity from my basement well, but it is LOUD. It is as loud as a large box fan on hi. I wouldn't mind, but the fan blows continuously, even when the target humidity is reached.The timer sets time before it turns on, or time until it turns off, but does not cycle on for a specific amount of time every 24hrs.If power goes out, it doesn't turn itself back on.So, this thing is a pain in the rear since I have to either leave it on 24/7, or go down in the basement and turn it on and off. I'm returning this unit and will look for something that turns on/off automatically based on a target humidity level, as you might expect a device like this to work.Edit after 5 days of use: This unit started short-cycling and stopped removing any significant amount of moisture from the air, so I returned it. Don't buy this junk!"
1,"This thing sucks big-time, not just water either","I got one of the ""good"" ones. It ran 3 whole years then died. It was loud, ran nearly continuously, used lots of electricity, but the console is nice looking. It ""replaced"" a Sears 40 pint reconditioned model that ran for 20 years w/o service. The Sears seemed to get just as much humidity out of the air w/ less noise and energy consumption. I think Haier is the German word for junk."
1,Died after a month,"Bought one of these 5 weeks ago and it worked reasonably well, although I was thinking about getting a second one since it wasn't keeping the basement humidity low enough.Then a couple days ago it just died. Was within the return period for the store I got it from so I took it back.There weren't many reviews on this brand of dehumidifiers. I'll be looking for a brand and model with lots of good reviews this time."
2,short battery life,"The battery was delivered promptly and is a Nokia branded battery. Apparently an old battery or stored incorrectly. Battery life of my original battery was days. Battery life of this battery is about one day in stand-by mode only, shorter life if talk time added in."
1,Not even close,I had bought this as a Christmas gift.Remember listening to an old album with this group as a kid and thought Mom would love this. Wrong!First clue something was wrong was that there were no words included for the songs. The old MM records always came with the words.We got to maybe the second song before we realized that this was NOT the Mitch Miller group and sounded nothing like them. I feel cheated by this and wish I had seen the other review before buying it.There are too many excellent Christmas CDs available to get conned by this one.
2,"this is not Mitch Miller's ""gang""","Caveat: This is not the usual group of Mitch Miller singers. On closer inspection, the cover states: ""Mitch Miller presents .... with Orchestra and Chorus"". I'd been looking forward to hearing the old gang from the television show that I remember so fondly from my youth. ""Singa-longa Mitch!"" I used to say. Instead this is a mixed chorus with fairly insipid arrangements, and even though the credits say it has been digitally remastered, there is a tinny quality to the production.I think there are much better Christmas albums you can find, and I will get another CD that has the group I remember."
3,Good protocols overview,"If you need a reference book this is a good one. It is not detailed enough to be used by professional, but it is useful to students. The Cellular Networks,ATM and SONET parts are not the best. LAN related parts are quite good."
3,Good read,Interesting book. Sometimes a little slow in parts and jumps around in date a lot. Enjoyable though. Would recommend to friends
5,Dr. Kaplan Scores a Bullseye,"This book was the product of a 20 year investigation into the farce now called the Amityville Horror. This book confirms what people have suspected for years that the Lutzes were in cahoots with mass murder Ronnie DeFeo Jr to create this hoax and help him get released from prison. This book is a sad incitement on modern society that such a horrible tragedy as the murder of the DeFeos by their eldest son could be made into such a money making hoax by their murderer eldest son, his lawyer and the Lutzes.."
5,Fantastic! Blows the lid off a 25 year conpiracy!,"If you ever thought this movie or any of the wild tales of the ""amityville"" Horror House were true this TRUE Investigation will fully open your eyes to the truth. Dr Kaplan documents all factual events surrounding the ghost story turn hoax in a fasinating and some what frank manor. Trust me it is a exillent read.Warning if you bought the story of the amityville horror and think it was true, this book will bring down the wall on every thing you once thought factual."
2,Interesting subject...boring book.,"Too many details - this book sounded like a jumble of facts all thrown together, but not interesting enough to really hold my attention. Given the subject matter, it could have been much more interesting. I sold it back to the bookstore without even finishing it."
3,"Great topic, okay book","The book tended to be a bit repetitive. I enjoyed reading it, but wouldn't really recommend it."
5,Awesome,This is one of the best books I have ever read. It makes you think more about the supernatural world. A 5 star book! Buy It!
3,Kaplan should have gotten a life,"First the positive. This book has some factual information. It illustrates some inconsistencies in Amityville Horror. There is little doubt that Jay Anson, Amityville Horror's Author, took some liberties with the Lutz's story in order to make AH a better book. However, Amityville Conspiracy reads as a 20 year obsession of Mr. Kaplan with the Lutz's because of a personal vendetta. Why did Kaplan feel the need to spend the last 20 years of his life as an adversary to George Lutz? Kaplan takes minor issues and extrapolates endlessly on them to prove his case. A case that really should have been dealt with via biopharmaceuticals and therapy between himself and a professional therapist. If you want the standard Amityville is a hoax propaganda researched over 2 decades. This is a good book. If you want Amityville analysis, Kaplan's OCD issue with the Lutz's pollutes what could have been an interesting case study on AmityvilleJill Leighton"
4,You get What You Paid For,"Kaplans book does a great job at debunking the Lutzes story. His writing doesnt flow very well and he does repeat himself often but he backs up all of his claims. He also seems to pat himself on the back occasionally but all in all its a good read. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the ""true story"" behind the horror.It is too bad it wasnt really true, i think that would have been much more interesting."
4,A rare treasure indeed!,"Ernesto Lecuona wrote many unforgettable melodies, many transferred from their original classical form to pop music with English lyrics, such as SIBONEY, etc. To be able to own the composer's OWN interpretations is unbelievable...after all these years. Listen to MARIA LA O as a golden example...It is worth the price of the entire CD. And there are more on this beautiful album. If the remastering is not perfect...who cares in this case?...remember, the original recordings are now well over fifty years old, originally cut on wax with a hot needle. But the pianist/composer's inner sensitive soul still shines through it all. I've never been to Cuba...but one day soon....and I'll be searching for Lecuona's soul in those Havana nightclubs where he once was a star performer if they still exist. Thankfully, his music does! Raw, moving, warm talent!"
5,Lecuona at his best!,"Ernesto Lecuona's music is as Cuban as a small cup of strong Cuban coffee -- and no one better than him to interpret it. This is a wonderful CD. Technically it is superb despite the age of its recordings; BMG and RCA did an excellent job. More than that, Mr. Lecuona's incredible talent brings life to his music and reminds us that Cuba had more than Cha-cha-cha and mambo, although those are also fantastic when interpreted well. Hearing Lecuona's ""LA COMPARSA"" reminded me of the years I spent trying to play it well and never achieving an adequate skill level. His ""ANTE EL ESCORIAL"" is one of my favorite pieces, evoking truly the grandiosity of the Escorial in Spain. If you enjoy Cuban music, you MUST get this CD before it disappears from the market. Even if you prefer cha-cha-cha, mambo or any other popular style. It is a masterpiece. Please keep them coming, BMG, RCA, and Amazon!"
5,BtB Marketing covers more topics than expected,"This book was a good buy. It covers all areas and medium where you can get in touch with potential customers (ads, mail, flyer, catalogs, sales brochures etc.). Mr. Bly always emphasizes the importance of including direct contact information. The book is full of useful hints, checklists, and examples of successful direct marketing measures."
4,Great for what it is.,"This is a great tripod for what it is: an inexpensive, small, lightweight tripod that will work for small cameras, and fit into your pocket. Sometimes, I even leave it attached to the camera when I slip it into an inside jacket pocket. I have used this tripod all over the world, and it works fine. It's not all that versatile, it could use grippy feet, but for $9, it's great. You do need a somewhat flat surface, but even on a bumpy surface you can adjust it to be level."
2,"Anti-doctor, Anti-men","I was really looking forward to this book. I was very disappointed. I feel that all they did was bash doctors, bash men, and extoll the virtues of Viagra."
5,For Women Only,"Groundbreaking subject matter presented in an easy-to-read format that is right on target for women of all ages. One suspects that it will be appealing to the full spectrum of womanhood: from pubescent to postpartum; from prostitutes to professors, hoping to enlighten their students with its highly instructive content."
4,better than cosmo!,"Like many guys, I get way to much of my information on a women's perspective on sex by browsing cosmopolitan magazine in airport terminals. this book is a true gem. from the case histories which many couples can relate to, to the historical perspective of the role of sex in women's lives, to the emotional and physical factors that effect how a woman feels about sex, this book is informative and really readable.the message is great for women (and their partners!). almost any problem can be dealt with if the source of the difficulty is pin pointed.i loved this book. now i can go back to reading sports illustrated!"
1,The Berman's Book and Height of Arrogance and Ignorance,"I was very unhapy with this book. I bought it under the guise thinking there would be new information on treating female sexual arousal disorder, a condition that has plagued my marriage over the last 8 years as my wife has had clitoral arousal and vaginal lubrication problems. There is nothing new in this book - except maybe a direct/indirect sales pitch for their clinic, and my wife and I are are contemplating a divorce due to her/our problem. The Berman's are NOT the experts they think they are - unless it's in the areas of hype and arrogance. Save your money and use the internet for information on Female Sexual Arousal Disorder, this book was a complete waste of money."
5,Good Start!,"I think this book has been great. It doesn't only tote Viagra. It discusses other options for people that can't take hormones or afford the little blue pill. It has opened up a whole new area for exploration into where to start to rectify any problems you may be having. I think that if you're looking for a place to start finding the solutions to your problems, this is the book for you."
4,Not just for Cats!!,My Chihuahua LOVES this bed!!! It keeps him nice and toasty all night and his little 5 pound body fits perfectly inside. I just need to find a new cover as his digging has left the bed a little worn....
3,Seems good to me; not cat.,"The product seems nice and does seem to be as represented. However for some reason, my cat avoids it totally, and does not like it at all. If I knew why, I would share."
2,returned,I decided to return the item and was very unhappy to have to pay a 15% restocking fee. I have bought a good many items through Amazon and was suprised about the 15% restocking fee. That seems excessive; especically after excessive shipping fees both ways.I think Amazon should get the merchant to refund me the restocking fee.Ken Lowry
5,Moving Read!,The family is a great read. I really enjoyed the Marottas! Richard Haddock definitely captured the spirit of a loving family and their individual and collective pain and I found myself very moved and touched by the time I finished the last page. For such a short book Richard Haddock developed the characters extremely well and I found myself able to identify with each of them. He also did a nice job capturing the women's perspective. The character of Danny and his situation gives the book a unique twist and I recommend this book for anyone that likes to be moved while also being highly entertained.
5,Una nueva visión de Puerto Rico y la literatura,Un libro muy bien escrito y bonito con artículos interesantes sobre Puerto Rico y sobre la literatura. Lo leí viviendo allí y me hizo redescubrir cosas nuevas y entender algo más la cultura puerto riqueña. Muy recomendable!
5,2 years on my living,"More than a decade have past since the McLaren F1 was on the street. No one has ever surpassed it. Not even themselves, with the new Mercedes SLR Mc Laren. So if you really want automotive history on your house, this is it"
5,An engineer's delight!,"""Driving Ambition: The Official Inside Story of the McLaren F1"" is an absolutely delightful book, especially from an engineer's perspective. It thoroughly and entertainingly tells the story of how an engineer and his team can achieve their creative dreams if allowed maximum latitude.The overall quality of the text, diagrams and photographs is excellent. And it won't disappoint motorsport fans, either! This book would be well worth twice the asking price."
5,Can't stop listening!,"This is my first Third Day CD, and I love it! Every single song has it's own personality, and Mac's voice is awesome. My personal favorite song is ""Still Listening"", but they are all fantastic. We own over 700 CD's, and I'd put this one in my top ten. Easily. This CD has followed me from the house to the car and back again since it arrived, and I'm still listening..."
5,Another great album from 3D.,"Third Day followed the platinum success of their worship album ""Offerings"" with ""Come Together."" This record was the product of an 18 month process and projects the theme of Christians putting aside their denominational differences and ""coming together"" as a unified body of Christ, obeying His command to ""Love one another, as I have loved you."" Back at the production helm is Monroe Jones, who has produced 3D since the ""Time"" album. My overall favorite song on CT is ""Still Listening,"" about opening one's heart to hear God's voice for direction in our lives, and how we often listen expecting to hear a mighty shout when in fact He is actually whispering to us. Some other great tracks include the title track, ""40 Days,"" ""Show Me Your Glory,"" ""Get On,"" ""I Don't Know"" & ""Nothing Compares."" ""Come Together"" is another great album from Third Day--one that I always keep closeby to listen to either at home or in the car."
4,Keepin' It Real,"I fell in love with Third Day when I bought their albums ""Time"" and ""Offerings"". The incredible worship they perform is wonderful to hear, because it's not boring or trite... it's upbeat, it's genuine, and it's original songs written themselves. I purchased ""Come Together"" as soon as it came out, anxious to hear what else Third Day had come up with. There are some great songs, such as ""My Heart"", that I honestly love. However, I had to cut them down to 4 stars out of 5, because at the end of the CD, I was a little disappointed. Perhaps it was the fact that the entire album was very upbeat and peppy, and I felt it lacked some of the deeper, mellower Third Day that I love. However, don't let my personal bias affect your opinion of this album. It's great, and definitely worth your listen- my deeper needs just weren't satisfied."
3,Solid... Not Bullet Proof,"I have to say, I never know what to expect from Third Day... This cd is in the same vein as others, maybe too much so. I feel strange writing a less than stellar review after seeing all the hoopla surrounding this release, but after digesting this cd, I keep feeling like I've heard this music before... I don't think anything was intentionally ripped off, but if you're looking for something totally new, totally fresh, and totally surprising... Well, just make sure to listen to the samples first, ok? I give it a 3 out of 5. Solid, but not bullet proof."
5,Content,If you like their CD Time you will definitely like this. I like to listen to Time while I'm at the Gym to get into my work out. The music is a little similar in that it really gets you psyched up. I bought one for my brother too! If you buy it you definitely will not be disappointed.
5,Amazing!!!!!!!,"Third Day has the Golden touch and this album is the evidence of this . When I first heard this album my heart felt like it was going to burst. They really love the Lord and this reflects in their music. You can tell they are not just producing albums they are worshiping God from their heart with their music and that's what their music inspires me to do. What more could I ask for!It has a more contemporary feel than Wire and Conspiracy no5 which are edgier so it is really easy listening.My top picks from this album are Show me Your Glory, When the Rain Comes and My Heart...."
5,Excellent material on early development of islam,The book is well written and provides a balanced view of isalm from a scholar who is very open minded and does not follow the usual mullah style religion practices or thoughts
5,"Insightful, readable, accurate, and scholarly","This is a well documented book on the early years of Islam and development of the Shia Islam (Ja'fari School), one of the major schools of thought and jurisprudence in Islam.It describes in detail the last years of Prophet Muhammad's life and the events that followed in the 50+ years after his death.The descriptions of the events that led to sucessions of the Khalifs after Prophet's death, and the insurgencies challenging Imam 'Ali's leadership are well written and fill a void in scholarly books on these events.Finally, this book provides one of very few worthwhile writeups in the Western literature on (the why's and how's) of Imam Hussayn's (Prophet's grandson and designate) martyrdom and on his successful drive to cleans the first Islamic nation of its corruption."
2,No acid pack.,Battery was delivered without acid. Had to go to local auto supply and spend $10.00 for acid.Could have bought complete battery cheaper at local store.
5,Just what I needed.,"I bought this same battery a few years back for twice this price at our local motorcycle shop. Same battery the only difference is the shop put the acid in for me. I do wish this battery came with the acid but even after spending an adittional $10 for it, it is still way cheaper."
5,"Moroni, the ancient prophet",A book full of interesting factsThe book is very enlightening and I loved it and would recommend it to all.
5,Scotti makes St. Peter's a living thing,"I read a lot of history, and this book is one of my favorites. Scotti manages to take you along on the miraculous construction of St. Peter's against the changing backdrop of Italian politics and war. It's the story of the Renaissance Popes who started the project, the later ones who shepherded its completion and the great geniuses -- Bramante, Raphael, Michelangelo, Bernini -- who left their marks on this project. I can't wait to visit Rome and see all of St. Peter's treasures that Scotti reveals in her book."
3,Nice and light...,"Ms. Scotti has written a nice tidy piece of approachable history of a fabled (Holy for some) landmark. Her ""history"" is by no means ""deep"", her story is entertaining and moderately informative (although her conclusions on personal thoughts are highly speculative). There are some extraneous passages where her prose reflects merely guess-work at actual events, but overall a nice tour. Nice diversion. Recommended."
1,Disappointing,I am very disappointed in the quality of research and of the prose.I found it almost impossible to keep myself engaged.
5,PHENOMENAL WRITER!,"R.A. Scotti again delivers a phenomenal account of what would seem to be dry history -- but instead she deftly creates a riveting account of the building of St. Peter's, its intrigues and politics and so much more! The way she has put this together deserves the attention of Hollywood.As Scotti did with her earlier account of the '38 hurricane in ""Sudden Sea"", she is a most agile and engrossing writer -- mesmerizing the reader with her easy flow and invigorating account. She is a most accomplished author, ""Basilica"" underscores her great ability. I look forward to more from R.A. Scotti. I am a great fan of this phenomenal writer."
4,"Review for the Kindle version, packback gets 5 stars.","This was a Book Club selection that we recently read and all loved. The history of St Peter's, both old and new, is really fascinating. Even though it is a fact packed book the writing style is very approachable.My only complaint with the book was that when I got to the book club meeting to discuss the book I found out that the paperback book has lots of photos and these were not in the Kindle version. Really, I could have gotten the paperback cheaper and I would have gotten more by getting to see some of the images. There are two Kindle readers in our group and we were more than a little miffed about this exclusion from our books.I say, it's a great read but make it even better and buy the paperback so you can get even more information (i.e. the pictures). I would have even been happy with the Kindle's not-so-great photo rendering."
2,Ultimately Disappointing,"Several other reviewers have gone into lengthy detail about the editing deficiencies of this book, so I won't re-hash those points. This book could've been so much more, and I certainly bought it expecting a much better reading experience. If you want a mildly interesting account of papal excesses and a mediocre account of the actual architectural and building history of St. Peters, this is your book. Otherwise, I'd recommend not reading it."
1,"Too many popes, not enough building","I very much anticipated reading a history of the building of St. Peter's. I was dismayed to learn that this book is a thinly-researched effort that is too pope-bio focused, with very little concentration on the building itself.Full of anachronisms, full of misinformation. If you can keep your lunch down when reading chapter titles like ""The Knaves of Saint Peter's"", you are a better man than I am.Thank God that I borrowed it from the library as opposed to buying it!"
5,great read!,"Fascinating and very readable history of St. Peter's Basilica. had no idea of the intrigue that surrounded the process, or how long it took to complete."
4,Ready to go.,"I enjoyed reading about the people dynamics of building St. Peters. I enjoyed the history and have now moved visiting St. Peters to the top of my ""places to visit before I die"" list."
1,Amazon,The description of this publication is poor. It does not tell what volumes are involved in the sale. If you order this you will probable get one published in a date other than the one you ordered.
2,Not a scholarly work.,"This biography is not that interesting. Unlike the recent biography of Lady Hamilton, which was utterly ridiculous yet immenently readable and entertaining, this book is neither of those things and thus kind of boring. Although Crossland has ""discovered"" some new aspects of de Chirico's biography, she doesn't really investigate him and his motivations in-depth. Instead of offering insight, the book has a formulaic feeling to it. Furthermore, if you're reading the book for scholarly information instead of entertainment, you're going to be disappointed in that respect as well. This is not a work by a historian or art historian, and it shows. That being said, sadly this is the only full-fledged biography of de Chirico. For that reason alone, you should probably pick it up... at the library."
2,"Not a definitive study, IMO.","This is a short and not terribly well written biography of Giorgio de Chirico. The author should refrain from interpreting what motivated the paintings because she seems to have a superficial understanding of what art is really all about. I would not consider this a serious study of the painter. As well, this book should have been better edited. For example, on page 114, following the death of the painter's mother: ""When he go back, in 1938, he had intended to have a splendid tomb built ..."" Fortunately, I bought this book as a remainder and even then paid too much at $16.98. Look elsewhere for depth on the great painter Giorgio de Chirico"
4,"Very Cheap, but effective.","What you see in the picture is pretty much what you get. I drive a 2000 ford explorer and had to do a lot of dremeling to get a 2 din head unit to fit. After trying 3 other kits, this was the only one that would fit and look aesthetically ok. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
2,Only buy it if you have to,"I knew just by looking at this thing that it was cheap but it was the only double-din mount I could find for a '97 Ford Explorer. All other mounts were single-din. When it arrived, it was everything that I expected, cheap, cheap, and cheap. Only buy this unit if you have no other alternative."
1,Do We Care?,"The film is a remake of the Audrey Hepburn and Carey Grant classic, Charade. Regina (Newton), Charlie's wife, comes home from vacation to find her home completely empty and her husband murdered. Some very nasty characters, apparently her husband's former colleagues, believe she is in possession of a very valuable item. Regina no longer feels safe and, just then, in steps the handsome stranger (Wahlberg), to her rescue. This sounds like the original, correct?Well, The Truth About Charlie is that Johnathan Demme (The Silence of the Lambs) should have left Peter Stone's original screenplay alone. This remake is disjointed and badly acted. Newton's performance is weak, Wahlberg is stiff, and halfway into the movie you don't care what the truth about Charlie is....you just want to return the film.Buy this DVD as cheaply as possible, only because it includes a copy of Charade on the flip side. If this version is not available, purchase the original."
1,horrific...waste of money and time,"First of all, I have never seen the original so I had no comparison to make. And even without the original to compare with, I need to write that this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen...in my lifetime! I had to actually turn off the television, eject the dvd, and return it to the store! Mark Wahlberg is the pastiest, dullest actor to hit the big screen. He was horrific. Horrifying facial expressions, and absolutely no charisma with Thandie Newton (who was actually quite good). However decent Newton's acting, the tricky camera work, and completely stale ideas for bringing ""artistry"" to the screen made for a boring film. Tim Robbins was absolutely abysmal. Dull City. Not even the scenery was eye-catching. I almost believe they just filmed in Hollywood and kept shooting the same hotel exterior every time they were ""in"" France. Wahlberg is no Pia Zadora (snicker, snicker). Do NOT waste your money."
2,The Truth About Charlie is,"a very disappointing movie. We all know Demme can better than this. Tim Robbins: becomes ridiculous, Thandie Newton: still trying, Lisa Gay Hamilton: doesn't make sense, Mark Wahlberg: miscasting, Joong-Hoon Park: OK but suddenly becomes Jason, Christine Boisson: ???. Sometimes remakes of classic movies become disaster and this is the case."
1,The 1 Star is for The Truth About Charlie Not Charade!,I bought this DVD but only for an inexpensive way to get a nice widescreen version of Charade because that classic is included on the B side of the disc and because I can't afford to buy the Criterion Charade DVD. In all honesty The Truth About Charlie is a horrendous movie and I think the director was trying too hard to make some kind of artsy French movie but wound up making a pretentious artsy fartsy mess instead. The director said he let The French camera crew do what they wanted to do and let the American crew do it their way but did he tell them to make sure it all came together flawlessy in the end? apparently not and it showed as this movie was very uneven and disjointed! Watch the original instead or watch an actual French movie that this movie is trying to imitate! Charade should have been on the A side f the disc with exta features and The Truth About Charlie on the B side.
1,Marky Mark is no Cary Grant,The only good thing about this DVD is that it comes with Charade. Hollywood is too intellectually bankrupt to create anything original and too pathetic to do a worthwhile remake. Marky Mark can't act. This movie has no class. A total waste.
3,Not the original but still decent,"While it doesn't have the same charm as Grant and Hepburn's ""Charade"", it does stand out in it's own right. Thandie Newton's character comes home one afternoon to find her house ransacked and her husband, Charlie, dead. The French Police, three assailants, an official from the OSD as well as a handsome love interest, charmingly played by Wahlberg, approach her looking for a valuable item which they believe her late husband left in her possession.Overwhelmed by the onslaught of events and mysterious visitors popping up into her life, Newton becomes desparately confused over who she can trust. It is equally as confusing for the viewer when the name switches start happening more rapidly. Despite it all, the movie is very stylish with a great soundtrack. Newton and Wahlberg's chemistry works very well on screen.Worth the watch."
1,This movie made me want to vomit...,"The only sort of alright thing about this movie was Thandie Newton. But even she didn't do justice to Audrey Hepburn's Regina. And Mark Wahlberg just doesn't have the charm, poise, or presence that Cary Grant brings to the screen. Most of the best, witty, and funny dialogue between Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant was cut from this remake. The Truth About Charlie just doesn't have the heart or pacing that Charade had. I couldn't even watch the entire movie.If you want to see a funny and witty mystery movie that keeps you on your toes see Charade. Skip The Truth about Charlie, its a waste of time!!"
4,Get it for Charade,"I decided to buy this DVD because it comes with Charade. I'd never seen the Truth About Charlie, and it wasn't that great. But even so, it was worth it for Charade!"
2,Buy it for the Charade bonus disc.,"TTAC was a bold remake, but missed everything that made the original so charming. The sexual tension and age difference between Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn made the screen light up. If George Clooney had played the Mark Walberg role it could have been salvagable. If you like slow, French impression films or are a film student, you might appreciate the pacing and lack of important dialogue. Otherwise, stick to the classic."
2,Play side B,"I don't know what is wrong with Jonathan Demme lately: why is he only remaking films that don't need to be remade? The difference between Charade and The Truth about Charlie shows the difference in filmmaking techniques over the years. Films have gotten more slick, more glossy, and more realistic-looking. They have also lost a lot of charm, wit, and intelligence. The plot of Charade was hard to follow, but I still have no idea what happened in The Truth about Charlie - and I'd seen the original. The craft of screenwriting was declined notably over the years: dialogue has gotten bad and plots have become incomprehensible. I will not pick on Mark Wahlberg for not being Cary Grant - that's too cheap. The cast in this film is YOUNGER - apparently because one must be young to be a film star in this day and age.The best thing about the DVD however is that it contains the original movie Charade on the other side - it is worth owning for that reason alone."
2,the truth is a charade,"Do yourself a favor and save your money. This is a poor remake of ""Charade,"" which was charming movie with Cary Grant and Audry Hepburn, with a few notable supporting players, including Walter Matthau. Re-cast the original, coarsen the language, add some more gratuitous violence, eliminate the chemistry, and you have The Truth About Charlie. No matter how earnest the acting, it is once again proof that Hollywood can do nothing but remake and ruin (think: Sabrina). Interesting as a last-minute or date diversion, but stay home and rent the original if you want warmth, charm, and a fine good guy/bad guy/ guessing game."
1,IN A WORD? AWFUL!!!!!,"You're telling me that this drech is supposed to be a remake of the classic film Charade?Gee, that sure was lost on me, since The Truth About Charlie bears about as much resemblance to that GOOD film as Audrey Hepburn does to Rosie O'Donnell.Badly written, badly made, BADLY ACTED & a total waste of time & money.Thandie Newton is cute as button, I'll give the other critics that & ONLY that, but even SHE can't save this tripe from itself.Mark Wahlberg is supposed to be Cary Grant? Yeah, ok.Maybe the casting director would also like to use Roseanne Barr to play Grace Kelly, if there is ever an onscreen bio.And, hey, I like ""Marky Mark"", but ALL of the the actors in this film should have spent their time making something worthwhile & moreover, worth watching.Oh and the gimmecky cinematography is nothing more than than an annoyance.And amateurish to boot."
2,tortuous but recommended,"The whole movie is a tortuous experience just like the storyline then the last two minutes brightens visually and the mood does a complete turnaround just like the Korean's face. Tortuous includes Mark Wahlberg's trademark menacing and guilty face, Thandie Newton's unsmiling face with overplucked eyebrows, Paris looking dirty, rundown and exhausting, the camera moving in too close and the background looking too crowded. We, the audience, are intentionally made to suffer along with the plot."
3,Good But Not Great! (Decent!),"The Truth about Charlie is a decent movie and I thought Tandie Newton was adorable as Reggie and Mark Whalburg was also good. No its not as good as the first movie with Grant and Hepburn and if you have ever heard te director talk about the first movie and this remake you will hear that he cast Whalburg in the Cary Grant roll because he wanted the character to not be suave and debonair like Grant but different, handsome in a streetwise type of way. One thing I didn't like in this movie was the addition of Reggie's late husbands Charlies mother who acted like she was a crazed bag lady or something!"
2,don't mess with classic cinema.,"I am not a movie critic by any means, but I have always felt that re-makes and sequals are tricky business at best, and some films can never be equalled, such is the case with Charade, I think any attempt to remake it will fail in some catagory and this one sure did for me anyway.The flim is uneven, and at times seems to be too tongue in cheek. The characters are ok, and Tandie Newton does bear some physical resemblance to Audrey Hepburn, well she does a little. Mark Wahlberg is ok as the stranger who comes to her aid, or so it seems, and then there is TIm Robbins as a mysterious government like official, but still it seems like this movie got to a good start and then the script blew away and they said well just wing it. Like I said, im no Siskel, or Ebert, but I know a good film when I see it and this one didnt hit the mark for me."
5,Finally CHARADE on mainstream DVD!,"The great thing about THE THING ABOUT CHARLIE on DVD, and the only great thing, but a momentously great thing, is that it includes a second DVD that provides the first legit mainstream DVD print of CHARADE, the 1963 movie it is based on. CHARADE is the best light mystery-comedy ever made, starring Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau, and the city of Paris, all in luminous form. It has been available in numerous pirated editions at your local dollar store - of threadbare print quality. It HAS been available in mint condition on a Criterion disc - but at a patrician price. Here you have it pristine AND affordable; and the quality rivals Criterion's; Criterion's may win by an atom. Anyway, I'm delighted with my ownership of this version. (To spell out what was implicit in the first sentence: THE TROUBLE WITH CHARLIE, a desecration of a sacred text, stinks.)"
1,This was really bad!,Ouch! I watched this without knowing it was a remake. After about 20 minutes I could see a thin plot of Charade popping out. This film was a bore and really annoyed me. I kept wanting Cary Grant or someone nearly as good looking to come on the screen. Mark Wahlberg was a bore and lacked the romance/grace of Cary Grant. Some movies should never be remade. I love Charade. It would have been good to know it was a remake. I only watched it to the end to see how badly they could butcher Charade.
2,Uninspired and boring!!!,"The Truth About Charlie, a lackluster remake of ""Charade,"" about a Parisian widow menaced by a gang of crooks, is uneven and uninspired. Steer clear of this boring mess and watch the original film instead. I don't know what Jonathan Demme was thinking and we might never find out."
4,Great Build-up,"This book had an excellent plot- not what I was expecting from a traditional regency. It was innovative and still had the requisite ""guy gets the girl"" ending. The only letdown was that the ending was rather rushed and it felt like a lot of action was shoved into the last two chapters that could have easily filled a few more. This book would have made an excellent novel without being rushed, and more detail could have been added after the wedding. Is the rumor true about a maximum page length for regencies?"
3,Track listing is wrong.,This album is linked to the mp3 download for the K-Tel 60's Super Hits mp3 download but it is a completely different compilation. The track listing for this album matches with the K-tel 60's super hits but does not correspond with the track listing for the CD pictured.
1,Long words with little meaning!,"Throughout his novel, Tolley uses complex language to distinguish his intelligence and then contradicts that with a story that says little to nothing and lacks originality. The novel is riddled with bits of information borrowed from other books that could be profound if used in a coherent fashion. However, he uses quotes largely for attention and his book reads like a really long boring T shirt. Save your money for a book that has been edited."
3,Leaving Trains - 'The Big Jinx' (SST),"'The Big Jinx' was my first ever listen I've had of the band,as I've heard OF them before,just never got familiar with any of their material until now.It's a decent find,good indie rock,as some might call it.Tunes I found to my liking were ""Sex War"",the prog rocker ""A Woman's Clouds"",the pop-ish ""Chloroformality"" and ""Go-A-F**kin' Head"".It's sort of a long shot,but this group might appeal to some fans of Dinosaur Jr.,Hole,Soul Asylum,Breeders and possibly Veruca Salt."
5,amazing worship,I can't say enough about the Spirit filled worship of Hillsong. I have enjoyed watching and listening to it over and over again. I highly recomend it for anyone who leads worship at their church.
1,truly worthless,"This is so unauthorized, that there are no performances, and not even any recorded music by madonna in the entire film. There are brief snippets from public appearances, but most of the screen time is taken up by interviews with extremely uninsightful, minor journalists. If you know much about Madonna, you won't learn much from this. Simply boring from start to finish. A waste of your time."
4,A GOOD SEQUEL! FOR THE MINDY CLARKE FANS TOO,"This is a pretty ... good sequel. Mindy Clarke is fantastic as savanah. I really dig this film. I like the opening with the modelling, and then when she goes back to Two Moon Junction, the placidness of it. As much as the sex scenes are hot and very sexy, I don't see this film as just an excuse of a story to make a poor sequel with lots of sex- that's not the case of the film. We all know with the first film that sex is the subject matter, and with director Zalman King, that's his specialty(which I like anyway). I recommend this film. Once again Mindy Clsrke is wonderful. She is the queen of actress', she's really at the top of her game. Even this being one of her earlier films in fact all of her films I'm constantly impressed with all her albilities.By Justine Ryan"
2,"Not as visually attractive as ""Two Moon Junction"".","Return to the two moon junction is meant to be a follow on from the first although it does this by focusing on Savannahs adventure (Aprils little sister in ""Two Moon Junction"") it is done forcefully as there wasn't any story there anyway. The dissapointment however is that the film has lost it's photographic appeal and visual creativity (colours etc.), which to me was the greatest appeal of ""Two Moon Junction""."
4,The movie wasn't too great but she had a nice body.,"This movie is for people that stay up late every night and watch those noodie cinemax movies. It is the type with basically no plot, just sex. But hey, whats wrong with that?"
4,HOT AND SEXY,"I SEARCH AND SEARCH FOR THIS MOVIE, IN DIFFERENT VIDEO RENTALS, TIL I RAN ACROSS IT ON EBAY, AND BID FOR IT RIGHT AWAY. THIS WAS NOT JUST A SEXY SCENES MOVIE WITH NUDITY, IT WAS A LOVE STORY, BETWEEN TWO FEUDING FAMILIES, WITH A NICE HAPPY ENDING. I ENJOYED THIS MOVIE, AS WELL AS TWO MOON JUNCTION I."
3,"not bad, but not as good as the original, predictable ending","Melinda Clarke, who isn't bad, but she's no Sherilyn Fenn, is the granddaughter model, who returns home to Two Moon Junction, meets her grandmother, played by a fairly decent looking (for her age)Louise Fletcher. Of course, she falls for the long haired, muscular, occupant of the property. There's sex, there's conflict, and ultimately, the predictable ending. She looks kind of familiar. (The press person on CBS's The District comes to mind.) Mildly erotic. Ok for general purposes; the original, as always, is better. [Correction to this review: This actress is not the one on The District, as I originally thought; however, she did play ""Mistress Heather"" on several episodes of ""C.S.I.-Crime Scene Investigation, my bad.]"
2,Below average film,"I remember Melinda Clark from her stint on the soap, ""Days of our Lives"". She is a beautiful woman, no doubt about that. But all I can say is this movie was dumb. It had many sexy scenes but little else. I found the first film to be slightly better, but it too lacked a decent storyline."
5,Excellent Shoes,"Really well built shoes. Handsome too, and the sole looks less ""clunky"" in person than in the pics. (They don't look at all dated to me.) The size seems to run a bit small."
3,Made in USA,"Good quality shoes made in US. Will probably outlast your desire to wear them. Very heavy, rough and inflexible for daily wear. Look quite outdated."
3,Chick-flick in disguise,"I thought this was more of a drama with lots of plot after watching the pre-view. It turns out to be a chick-flick in disguise. Regardless, I made the best of it and enjoyed the movie to the end."
5,Good Balance,"In her book Awake Mind, Open Heart, Ms. Kneen wonderfully sets forth the image of the Shambhala warrior, Buddhist yet imbued with that pro-active spirit that distinguishes itself from (the admittedly sterotypic image) of the the monk in the cave or even the layperson going about their daily Buddhist business.Ms. Kneen's writing posseses the intellectual clarity found in academic treatises with the sense of ecstasy and compassion found in art and poetry.The discussion of mindfullness-awareness in particular, a concept that continues to confuse and lose me, is the best I've read..."
5,Great piece of work,The only Onyx and Amethyst necklace I could find that looked great. Most others where gaudy.My wife loved it. By the way They're the 2 birth stones for February which is why I hunted for a necklace made of the 2.Great craftsmanship.
3,Professional Framing is a Joke,this is the least professional framing job I have seen. The frame is cheap and the print was just stuck in & the points inserted on the back. The print slipped around in the frame. There was no dust cover on the back & this is really what constitutes professional framing. I would never spend the money to have framing done with this seller again.
5,Nice fragrance.,"It is floral, not as strong as the original Euphoria, I think it is perfect for the spring and summer time."
3,Only Rebecca Holden stands out in this boring film.,We only bought this film because of Rebecca Holden. She turned out to be the only one who knew how to act and her scenes were worth watching. The rest of the film was a rambling train wreck with a lot of footage obviously used on a moving train for lack of a real plot.
1,Broke within 5 minutes...,"Simple. I unpacked the charger, plugged it into the wall, went to plug it into the phone, and the piece that plugs into the phone came apart at the seam, exposing the wires from within. I unplugged it and tried to put it back together to no avail. Due to the low price, it quickly went in the garbage."
2,"Umm, skip this one","While I dont have US Open Tennis, I did just buy US Open 2002, which I assume is an upgrade to the game listed here. If so, I cant imagine how lousy the first version was.The player control is horrible. You swing and miss far too often. Sometimes your player takes off running in the opposite direction when you were trying to aim your shot. The tennis season is just 4 tournaments long. It appears that the only players you will be playing in your career are the few pros who stuck their name in the box.Hold out for Tennis Masters Series 2002 or whatever theyre going to call it (maybe 2003), due out soon. While it may not be perfect either, it should definitely be better than this."
4,GREAT MORAL LESSON!,A very good movie with a good moral message. I really like the move. it is one that should be watched by anyone that has any type of prejudices.
4,"Kind of needed a stronger ""Jesus saves message.","Great movie but... was disappointed that the Gospel was NOT given. It was kind of referenced to but no clear picture of Jesus saves is given (Acts 16:29-31). Leave that out and there is no grace for the grace card. If your going to do a Christian movie... it always helps to have a ...""gospel"" message."
3,Good message/bad acting,"I loved the message in this movie. It is just too bad that Christian films use B level actors, although I thought the two main characters did a good job."
5,Grace Card,"It was an excellent movie that I have watch twice, purchase four copies as gifts and referenced in my Diversity classes. I recommend it for everyone. We now have a copy in our church library."
5,Great Movie about the power of forgiveness....,This movie is a must-see for everyone who calls themselves Christians but don't understand the power of forgiveness...the acting is superb and the story line is plausible...just great!
2,Better than Nytol !!!!!!!,"Yes there is a message in this movie. It takes toooo long to get to it, and once you get to the meat and potatoesof the movie your off in LALALA land.Message of forgiveness is hard to swallow and they try to simplify way to much for me."
5,forgiveness on all fronts,"This movie is GREAT! It deals with ""issues"" on every front: Father/Son; Mother/Son; Husband/Wife; between friends; racial prejudice; tragedy and shows what True Grace is. I highly recommend it to everyone. It would also be a great movie to show in a class at church. Could open the door for some true repentance, discussion, and love to flow in a new dimension."
5,Must watch movie!,"This is an amzing movie! A good clean movie with a powerful message! I highly recommend this movie. Also, received this way ahead of schedule! Loved it so much, I got extra copies for my kids & their families!"
3,.,"great story but too long and drawn out otherwise the story was good. I would not watch it again, at all."
5,Very good movie,We have enjoyed watching Grace Card and after several times watching it we still enjoy the movie. Thank you! We will be ordering again.
4,Makes a Great Gift. Very inspirational,Bought is as a gift for someone. Am guessing that they liked it. I know I would have if it has been given to me.
5,"An Intelligent, Beautiful Book","Upham and Zappia have paired a haunting group of Native American photographic portraits by Curtis with a selection of Native stories that Curtis collected. The authors' introductory chapters reveal the broad range of their research, which they present concisely, to provide a thoughtful historical context for the primary materials. The Gilcrease Museum of Tulsa, in association with the Washington State University Press, has produced a book that is not only intelligent; but the symphony of brown tones in the prints throughout make it coffee-table beautiful."
4,A very good gift and instructional book.,This is a very good book to provide insite and reflection on our worship in the Eucharist and interaction as Church.
4,Danger in Quicksand Swamp,"When Ben and Jake found the treasure map and canoe buried in the sand they couldn't of been happier. They would go out onto a river by their houses and stay out all day. When they found the entrance to what seemed to be blocked off by chicken wire, Ben and Jake couldn't resist going into the swamp.When they reached the island in the middle of the swamp, they go swimming. Later, they noticed a huge log floating towards them. One of them acknowledges that it is an alligator and tells the other to swim as fast as he can.On top of the alligator problem there is quicksand as far as the eye can see. Not only is there quicksand, there is a strange man in the shadows watching them and waiting for them to die. The man in the shadows also sunk the canoe, so Ben and Jake are stranded on an island surrounded by quicksand and alligators.To find out what happens to Ben and Jake you must read the book."
5,ALL THAT!,"AS USUAL,I WOULD EXPECT NOTHING LESS THAN THE BEST FROM ANY OF EARL KLUGH""S WORK.AND AS I SAID ALL THAT!"
4,True classics are like fine wine,"Finding that this album is now available on CD is a pleasant surprise, though it should've been reproduced in it's entirety. The moods that Earl Klugh inspires in this album and its delivery are nothing short of masterful. I owned this album on tape in the 80's and before it was damaged, it was one of my most frequently played tapes. I'm greatful that someone decided to put it on CD because each instrumental is timeless and classic Earl Klugh."
5,"Mellow, warm & romantic...","This is to me quite possibly one of the most ROMANTIC jazz guitar CDs ever made !! I have had it on LP for over 15 years and the CD version sounds fantastic !! Mr. Klugh's warmth and talent really shines here... it's perfect for those ""special times"" with a loved one, or if you just want to chill after a hard day at work...Earl Klugh has made many good albums, but for me Heart String has such a warm, intimate feeling to it... every song touches your heart in a different way. It will always be my favorite !!Anyone wishing for an escape from all the noise and negativity of this era might want to check out this ""old school"" mellow jazz classic... you won't be disappointed !!"
3,Readable entertaining insight into big biz hierarchies.,"Esteemed executive, Wess Roberts, weaves an involving teaching tool of equal parts history, fantasy and illustrative instruction. This unique ""how to"" on building and leading a big business hierarchy from the middle, and the top, is also a true to history, interpretive extraction of the Hun empire revived and empowered by one man, Attila the Hun. Attila's own success is not only an analogous base for the lessons at hand but also their validation. An easy, concise read for top and middle managers on the go; an overlooked gem in a pile of rubblous hype."
4,Eye-opening and informative.,"Gave me insight to my ""Atilla"" at work and help to understand him. I love the book and hope to get more of Wess' books."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping this book would give me suggestions as to how to deal with angry children in this age bracket. Instead, it didn't give me any suggestions as to how to help these kids. It listed a bunch of reasons regarding why these kids might be angry, but did not help me teach them anything."
4,schlage knob,packaging was damaged but product was fine and it was easily installed and looks great! Too bad did not qualify for Prime.
3,Was ok,Ordered this CD but didn't realize it was all in spanish instead of italian. Wasn't aware that this CD does come in spanish. Was more or less useless for me and gave it away. I guess I can't blame the seller for not noticing it. My fault.
4,What An Outragous Family!,"Lilah and Suzanne's stories were a good follow up to the first of this series (C.C. and Amanda). I had a hard time staying into Lilah and Max's story. To me they just didn't seem to ""fit"" as a couple. Anyway, this was the slowest story in all of the series. Suzanne and Holt's story made up for it though, cause they were so easy to fall in love with. All in all I enjoyed reading about the Calhoun's. I really get into Nora Roberts books when she does a series like this. You get the chance to find out what happens after they fall in love and ""live happily ever after"". I just found out that there is a follow up to this series. It is a Silhoutte romance called Megan's Mate. Megan is Sloan's sister (Sloan married Amanda). Anyway I'm off to start it next!"
5,Enchanting,The 2-book series of the Calhoun sisters was wonderful. I was so involved in reading both books that I couldn't put them down. I loved the way the Nora Roberts wrote and kept the reader so involved in all the characters. She made each women so dynamic in their own way and the men in the lives that fit each personality. I was so interested in reading each life and seeing how they each fit together and worked together to end the books. Great Job!
5,I love family sagas,I love when Robert's writes many stories about one family. Its great to see the characters over and over.
3,Engrossing but predictable,After reading the first; Catherine & Amanda i had to read the next-Lilah & Suzanna. It's engrossing but for me a bit too mushy and predictable. I prefer a story line that is a little more realistic even though it is a romance novel. If you like the usual romance you'll definitely enjoy this one. Hope this helps.
5,That Nora Roberts woman,"Nora Roberts is at again! She creates people in a few sentances and makes you feel like you have always known them. Lilah and Suzanna are two of four sisters living with their eccentric aunt in a falling down old mansion. Add in handsome men, a thief and missing emeralds with an antique love mystery and you have all the elements of a good read. Sit back and enjoy! The ending will surprise you."
1,Missing Merchandise,"I ordered this book weeks ago and was promised delivery by January 14. That in itself was a long time, but didn't figure I'd have a lot of time to read around the holidays anyhow. I have not received the book yet and it is now January 21st."
1,Contrary to the rest of the reviews...,"... I thought this Nora Roberts book was dreadful.It was obviously written at the beginning of her career. Definitely not worth buying, borrow from the library and buy one of her later books. Instead of this, buy the Three Sisters' trilogy, or In The Garden trilogy. Can't wait for her latest trilogy.If possible, I would have rated this a minus one,sorry Nora."
4,Two good stories about two great sisters,"Lilah and Suzanna was a quick read. I must say, I think I liked Suzanna's story better. I did not read the first book ""Catherine and Amanda"" before I read this one, so I don't know if I missed something or not. Suzanna and Holt are great together and her kids are pretty cute, too. Not to mention her dog Fred and Aunt Coco. Never a dull moment in the Calhoun house, especially when great-aunt Colleen comes to visit. This book will keep you occupied for at least 2 days, if not more. I can hardly wait to read her other books!!!"
2,"Roberts, you've disapointed me this time","I have noticed that Nora Roberts doesn't stray too far from original plots. Does anyone else find in funny that Suzanna's story is strikenly familar to Laura's story in FINDING THE DREAM? Another thing that is funny, woman in the Calhoun family seem to fall in love very quickly. Come on, it took less than a week in COURTING CATHERINE. Unrealistic, unimaginitive. I am glad though, that Ms. Roberts managed to squeeze in a bit of the mystery that she often adds to her best sellers. I can't say that the Calhoun Women series got a great deal of that spice that makes her best sellers, but it trickled in. Great job on MONTANA SKY, DIVINE EVIL, THE REEF, The Templeton series, and the Ireland series. But please, spare me the cheesy romance books like the McGregors that they try to pass off as a novel."
1,False advertising,"In my eagerness to get Double Layer blank media I made the mistake of ordering this product. There is only 1 double layer disk out of 10. Since DVD+R media goes for about $1 per disk that means the double layer disk costs $21. Not very practical. I should have looked at the picture on the box more closely. The product detail description needs to be changed from ""8.5GB on single-sided disc"" to ""8.5GB on only one out of ten single-sided discs"" to be more clear."
1,Don't buy this,There is only one 8.5 GB disk in this 'solution kit'. All the other disks are 4.7 GB. The ad is pretty much an outright lie.
2,The name of the pack is trying to fool you.,This pack only includes one dual layer blank. all the others are single layer blanks. Some ads dont tell you the content and the picture is too small to see the contents.
3,Caveat emptor,"With all due respect to the previous reviews, the package does clearly indicate (along with most of the online descriptions and forum discussions) that only one DL exists in the box along with 8 8x and 1 RW. This makes it very expensive, at the current time, to test a new DL drive (or a firmware hacked one)."
3,Interesting twist on vampire flicks...,"This film is a fictionalized version of the making of the classic film, ""Nosferatu."" I say fictionalized because there is a plot twist toward the end of the film that makes this movie hard to believe. Hard to believe, but interesting nonetheless. Willem Dafoe is Max Schreck, a method actor who has agreed to play the vampire in F.W. Murnau's film, ""Nosferatu."" The cast and crew are stunned by his appearence and habits, but the man holds a darker secret that must be seen to be believed. John Malkovich, an excellent actor, plays Murnau flamboyantly and keeps him obsessed with his art. But it is Dafoe that steals the show, even getting an Oscar nomination for his part. The buildup to the dramatic climax is excellent, but the film runs out of fuel a little too early and the viewer is left with a half-full cup of a movie experience."
3,Please don't bother buying this DVD,The movie was filmed beautifully with great effects. However the movie was far too short and the concept that the movie was based on was never REALLY explored to a great degree. I found the movie unsatisfying as a whole. If you'd like to rent this movie be my guest. It isn't a waste of time or anything but it certainly wasn't what I was expecting.
2,Great premise but runs out of steam.,"I had looked forward to seeing this movie for a long time and after I was finally able to watch it on video I was distinctly under-whelmed. While the original silent film ""Nosferatu"" is deservedly considered a classic, a movie about a classic doesn't guarantee great results. Willem Dafoe is in creepy fine form as Max Shreck, the actor who played the vampire in the original silent and John Malkovich turns in yet another fine performance. However, the strangely anti-climactic ending leaves one feeling let down."
4,Chilling to the Bone,"John Malkovich. The name really sums it all up. I don't think there is another actor that really gives it his all more than he does. Consecutively he gives us, the audience, such movies as In the Line of Fire, Being John Malkovich, and RKO 281. Add in the Academy Award Nominee Willem Dafoe and you get an interesting black comedy about the making of the famed movie Nosferatu. The movie is very dark and you can hardly tell that Dafoe is hiding in that crazed blood-sucking vampire. Everything about this movie makes it worth watching. Check it out, you won't be dissapointed one bit that you did."
2,Nothing To It,"I was told that Shadow Of The Vampire is a much better movie than most productions of its genre. The starring of charcacter actor John Malkovich propped up this expectation, and so did the fact that it's filmed in my country of residence, Luxembourg.But no. There are only two good things about this movie! The acting is very very good, and the plot is much more original than in ordinary vampire stuff.And that's all! The movie itself is not at all exciting. Not catching, in no way scary, and not very well-written either.A disappointment - avoid it."
2,nothing impressive,"I'm just your average movie goer. I'm not a film school drop out (I'm a RN), I'm not obsessed with movies and I'm certainly no literally fount of knowledge. That being stated, I was unimpressed by this remake. Nothing within this film spoke to me, moved me or made me feel anything whatsoever besides ""is this almost over?"", the cinematography was even bland.Maybe this movie was made for a certain audience, but being your average laymen when it comes to movies, this one left me totally cold. Malkovich didn't seem to portray the qualities and passion of an obsessed director, and Dafoe did about as good of a job in his role as my 8 year old nephew could do. The only one in the movie who seemed to show an ounce of character was the brazen replacement photographer. I don't know. Maybe you'll sneer at this because I'm not educated in the world of film. But hey, if it sucks, it sucks."
3,"fictionalized and embellished account of the filming of Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (3.5/5)","this fictionalized and embellished account of the filming of the 1922 classic vampire tale Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens,directed by Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau was certainly eerie and atmospheric.Willem Dafoe is unrecognizable as Max Schrek/Count Orlock underneath all the prosthetics and makeup,and pretty much inhabits the character.John Malkovich portrays Murnau as possibly insane.the scenes of interaction between Murnau and Orlock crackle with intensity.i also liked the opening sequence.i thought it really set the mood,although i could see how some people might think differently.it is a bit long,and at first glance doesn't appear to be relevant to the rest of the film.anyway,i liked it.for me,Shadow of the Vampire is a 3.5/5"
1,"What, no zeros?","Excellent lighting, great photography and editing, fantastic makeup, brilliant acting and still it's a zero. John Malkovich turns in a memorable performance. Willem Dafoe as Max Schreck is at times truly chilling. In spite of that, if you leave wondering ""what the hell was that about"", you're with the majority of moviegoers who feel there should also be some sort of plot as well. This is ""Porky's Revenge"" masquerading as art."
2,not good,"If not for Willem Dafoe, I would have given this film one star. It was basically boring, pointless, disjointed, uninteresting, unrealistic, illogical, and oh yeah, did I say boring? John Malkovich and Cary Elwes could have really used some extra time with an accent coach, too. Too bad. With that lineup of actors and the idea they had to work with, it could have been great."
3,Unsatisfying,"Intriguing and stimulating, but ultimately disappointing and unsatisfying. The opening credits are beautifully filmed with patterns of intricate designs, and the sound track, the camera work, and the acting of Willem Dafoe and John Malkovich is great. The storyline (a director hiring a real vampire to act the part of a vampire) is very convincingly presented. I especially enjoyed some of the comic scenes between the director (Malkovich) and the vampire (Dafoe). However, the second half is boring.The DVD does come with plenty of extras, including interviews, trailers, and commentaries. Particularly interesting is a trailer of ""Begotten,"" another movie by E. Elias Merhige, the director of ""Shadow of a Vampire."""
3,Shadow of the Vampyre,"Interesting and inventive spin on the Nosferatu mythos. A black comedy and film-within-a-film, Shadow of the Vampire is certainly worth a look, but by the end you feel that theres something lacking. Though his make-up is really good, Dafoe doesn't really resemble actor Max Schreck. (They don't even have the fangs in this film!). The cast are very good however and in time it may become a minor cult classic, although it isn't very memorable."
4,"Eerie, Dark and Inventive","The movie took me by surprise, I wasn't expecting Nosferatu to be real. The darkness of the film and the poetry used to set the tone worked for me. The acting was very good, especially William Dafoes. The way he would tap his long nails together and pull his face in so it looked like he was sniffing was fascinating. The greediness of the director and the need to get his picture as real as he could makes you wonder if directors are really like this. His obession of getting all the carnage on film makes you think he is a human monster, using dracula as his weapon to inflict death on the innocent. Although, the main actress still feels the need to play out her part even in the throes of her deathbed. The narcisstic need to be a legend still is a consuming passion. Wow, what some people will do to achieve fame. Well, the movies depth and style caused me to give it 4 stars.Lisa Nary"
3,don't bet on this Bete Noir,"Shadow of a Vampire has all the ingredients of a black, black film, but comes off no more than a dark shade of grey. Still, not too shabby for a film whose brilliant acting includes a cast comprising Willem Dafoe, Eddie Lizard, and John Malkovitch."
4,Shadow of the Vampire,"Willem Dafoe gives an outstanding performance as usual. The rest of the cast also performed well, including Udo Kier, who has come so far from the camp/trash Andy Warhol horror flicksFlesh For Frankenstein / Blood for Dracula 2 DVD Set Criterion PAL. I enjoyed watching him as much as Dafoe! But John Malkovich, plays John Malkovich. His acting here as in most of his movies is worst than Udo Kier in the Warhol films. By no means let this stop you from buying this movie because, not even Malkovich's terrible acting can ruin it. If you haven't seen Nosferatu with Max SchreckNosferatu (The Ultimate Two-Disc Edition), it's a must that you see it first to appreciate Shadow fully. It's as important to the enjoyment of the film as seeing Plan 9 From Outer Space before watching Ed Wood. Then see Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's 70's remake of NosferatuNosferatu: The Vampyre/Phantom Der Nachtfor another perfect performance."
4,Brilliant,"This movie is working with the premise that Max Schrek, who played the vampire in the classic Nosferatu really was a vampire. The premise works and does so brilliantly. Malkovich is more frightening than the vampire as he plays a man so hell bent on making the perfect vampire movie that he has no problem with risking the lives of his crew, especially his leading lady to do it. William Dafoe plays a vampire so old that he can barely remember life as a man and he is stunning, especially in his monolouge on the movie set. Both he and Malkovich should've won Oscars for their peformances. The movie is spooky, inteligent and yes, even funny in places."
3,it doesnt suck (your blood) at least ...,"akin to ""confessions of a dangerous mind"" in that the movie takes a mostly-forgotten slice of popular history (here, the filming of the 1922 classic ""nosferatu""), and gives it a back story loaded down with the fantastic and bizarre. i think the filmmakers thought they were making a great movie, but its really just a frequently fun exercise in vanity, highlighted by the fun hamming of willem dafoe as pseudo-vampire max schreck."
5,must like dark comedy with pathos and layers,"a lot of vampire films should be held up for ridicule . i won't mention any by name here . the proliferation of reverent vampire films and related filmaking with long leather jackets and romance and pretentious scripts is a silly trend . a trend targeted at a young , white , male/female demographic that is too young and/or oblivious to seperate the wheat from the chaff . visit this film or ""THE HUNGER"" , hammer's ""CURSE OF DRACULA"" , ""BLADE II"" , ""THIRTY DAYS OF NIGHT"" , television's ""THE NIGHT STALKER"" , ""FRIGHT NIGHT"" , JOHN CARPENTER'S ""VAMPIRES"" and LON CHENEY JR. as ""THE SUN OF DRACULA"" just to name a few . why ? so as to get clued into the fun and possibilities of vampire pictues . i love a lovely goth girl as much as the next guy . lighten up and keep an open mind though . it's entertainment ."
4,Holy... this is some freaky stuff...,"This movie is one of the freakiest thing I've ever seen. I think Willem Dafoe plays one of the chilling characters ever on screen. He plays with romantic view of vampires that is played up in all other films. We see a very lonely, miserable vampire that has seen the centuries drag on until he is confronted with playing this roll in Murnau's creepy classic, Nosferatu. The last scene of the movie is one of the most uncomfortable things I've ever seen. Murnau's attempt to capture as much realism as he can makes the entire audience shift in their seats. I also liked the way the 35mm movie would transform into the older 16mm from that time."
4,Left it smiling...,"When you put Willem Dafoe, John Malkovich, and Eddie Izzard all in one movie, it's bound to be good. And this film does not dissapoint. Its a little like watching something on the History Channel in it's mockumentary style story- a serious spoof of sorts- presenting the behind the scenes story of the great classic German film Nosferatu. Although a little show moving, I just enjoyed watching these great actors do what they do. (Plus vampiric content always gives bonus points in my book.)Overall, a light look at early filmmaking and an entertaining conspiracy peopled with fabulous performances."
1,Disappointed,"I thought John Malkovich was good enough to save any film, but not this one, although he is good. I tried twice to see it to the end and always fell asleep before the middle. Willem Defoe as the Vampire got no fascination, no appeal whatsoever, you wonder how come a man like Murnau goes crackers over this snickering, handrubbing parody of a creep. Poor Max Schreck, who was REALLY frightening. He hasn't deserved this."
1,The worste vampire movie ever made,"I am not only a huge horror fan but a great fan of vampires. I was very dissapointed with this movie. 3 of us rented it and 3 of us turned it off and left. I tried hard to get into this movie, assuming because of the wonderful cast, that it had to get better. After sitting through an hour of it I couldn't take any more. I was the only one still awake. It put my other 2 friends to sleep. A complete waste of money."
1,I'll get to liking it another time.,"Well, I think that this movie was bad, an Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe) is supposed to actually be a vampire or cannibal or whatever. He doesn't have fangs though, and this movie could have done good if it was called ""Nosferatu"" and if it followed the same story as the REAL F.W. Marnau's classic Nosferatu. Therefor, this movie gives the real ""Nosferatu"" a bad name and I think Hollywood should cancel it before anyone else buys it, ...."
1,"not funny, not scary, not good",It took me three days to complete this movie. I could not get into it. The Vampire looked good and the props were nice. I didn't laugh once. I don't like to watch movies with nudity so I checked out the rating and it didn't say anything about nudity however it does contain nudity. I'm an Ed Wood fan and seen a lot of ref. to his movies in the review. Not Ed wood type.
2,Why?,"Willem Dafoe was great in this film, but that's as far as this good review goes. Maybe, I just didn't ""get"" what they were trying to do with this film. The story seemed extremely underdeveloped and was very rushed toward the end. Like the entire film crew suddenly realized that they had drug their feet during filming and had 10 minutes to tie it all up. Nosferatu was brilliant, and this almost downplays it's brilliance."
1,A move made in Hollywood for people in Hollywood,"I've long be a fan of the orignal Noseratu. I thought this might be a fun movie to watch. I've not seen Herzog's remake, but I might after this.This movie was more about egos and film making than it was about Vampires. Dafoe's character is downright comic. Let me take that back, he's ATTEMPTING to be comic. He's not funny. The sad part is he isn't even scary. Malkovich is unconvincing as Murnau playing the stereotypical egomanic director. The fake accents and bad ""recreations"" of scenes from original silent film really put me off.If I worked in the film industry, I might have enjoyed this film. As it was, I felt like it was a series of ""inside jokes"" and I was not an insider.I suppose I need to attend film school or something to appreciate this film. As it stands it comes off as a self-indulgent piece of dreck made for film snobs. It fails as comedy and fails as a horror film.I really was expecting better."
1,DREADFUL...yet not full of dread.,"This movie is so full of bad acting & bad accents that one wonders if there's some unspoken contest being perpetrated upon the film public by the powers-that-be in Hollywood: How rotten can we make this stuff before they stop paying to watch? Malkovitch playing another cartoony 2-dimensional lisping wierdie is particularly painful to watch. I'm sure I saw him in a good performance years ago. I just can't remember what. What's most irksome about this amateurish venture, though, is the desecration of a great director. ..."
1,"Bad Plot, Bad Acting, and a Mockery on a Good Movie","Please, do not watch this. It insults an extremly good example of early film. Watch Nosferatu and apreciate good acting. Don't watch this and see a an exaple of over thought art house crap"
2,Nottin much hetre,i getz hopw smart and sly thiz flicks wantz to bea but it getz to da points ofz beaing dum! it getz boreing afte a while. the direvcting isz okey and so isz da actting bute the movie just getz breingt thatz all iz can says. don't wastez two muche time onz thisz 1.......peace!
3,A realistic one...,"Well, it wasn't so scary but it looked really realistic! John Malcovich and Willem Dafoe are really into their roles and they give out a very good result. A director tries to shoot a horror film with a real vampire in it and in exchange for his very important contribution, the director gives the vampire the opportunity to drink the blood of an actress! Thrilling but not something special!"
2,Admittedly different take on a vampire movie,"Scores points for cleverness, interesting themes, and some dynamite acting by Willem Dafoe, but this movie never quite takes off as a gripping piece of cinema. Worth a look, though, especially right after watching, as I did, the original ""Nosferatu"" (if you don't already know, the story in ""Shadow of the Vampire"" takes place amid the filming of that original silent classic). The DVD offers a nice print and a fair amount of extras."
3,"Good actors, and a good premise, but...","Really not much of story. William Defoe had a few funny lines as the vampire on the movie set/buffet. The only one he bit was the, I think, the film editor. Kind of disappointed in the story, but good idea. Could have been better though."
2,Hmmmmmm....,"I rate the DVD media and image/sound quality with four stars. The movie itself???? ..... incredibly boring. The only DVD that I have given away because I KNOW I will never watch it again....this coming from someone who keeps an extensive library of DVDs. I can see that this movie was artistically well done and the performance by Willem Dafoe was great....however, the film just did not hold my interest and I am getting a bit burned out with Malkavich's type casting as a deranged lunatic."
2,Not One of the Better Vampire Movies,"The idea behind ""Shadow of the Vampire"" was pretty good. There are mysterious problems on the set while the filming of the classic story ""Nosferatu"" and eventually we learn the problem is our lead man really is a vampire. The final conclusion of the movie is outright ridiculous. It was almost like they decided they better wrap up the movie . . . well, this will do. The movie is somewhat strange and very slow paced. It's interesting for maybe one viewing but I can't imagine sitting through it twice."
1,Haven't a clue,"I got this book mixed up with books written by John Locke. He has written some westerns that are adult oriented and I thought this one was one of those. I haven't even read this book yet. Sorry to anyone confused by this, I have no idea if it is adult, I doubt it, its a Classic, but I highly recommend John Locke's ""Don't Poke the Bear"", and ""Emmet and Gentry"". I enjoyed the hell out of those. Sorry bout that. fredt"
5,Best drawing book ever!!!!,I love this book! I have never seen a book like this on drawing. After you read the first few pages you want to go and try it. I am only 14 but i think this is the best drawing book ever. I have used other drawing books but this one is the best. Get this if you are a beginner or an advanced drawer.
3,Have fun (sarcasm),"I think that it was half great, half horrible. It shows drawings of nude women. It doesn't give you step-by-step, it tells you what to COPY!!!!!!!!!!!! It's worth a hunk of junk."
3,easily scratched!!!,"I got this for my husband because the style was perfect. However, I was soon disapointed because the ring is easily scratched which is a SURPRISE because its Titanium and I thought is would be durable. Also, I find this seller to be very defensive about customers' satisfaction. too bad."
1,What was this garbage?,"I am FROM NO. I have to write a paper on NO literature for my NO lit class. I chose Almost Innocent thinking this was going to be a great read. Boy, was I wrong! I am astonished by all of these high remarks on this book. I thought the book was TERRIBLE. Just because a book takes place in NO doesn't make it NO literature!!!If you want GREAT NO literature read A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES. That is TRUE NO lit.Thank you!"
3,"Lil Ric is not from the ""south""","Lil Ric is tight. Im glad hes not with No Limit anymore. They are sorry. Everyone knows that no limit's only good releases were when they were an underground Bay Area rap label. West Coast Bad Boyz 2 and TRU's true to the game were the last good albums they put out. So it's not down south rap- it's Bay Area rap- at least it was when it was good. Now it's garbage. But anyway, Lil Ric is tight- this cd is pretty well put together. I don't think it does him justice though. Some better production would help Ric. To:""doggfather"" the review guy from la- Lil Ric is from Richmond, NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. Maybe you should stick to snoop and doggies angels aiiight. Check out Lil Ric on West Coast Trippin 2. Its game fasheeez."
3,Another history lesson....,"Very true....Lil Ric was one of the first to be signed to No Limit when it was all about Richmond and the East Bay. But Lil Ric didnt give his best effort until after that broke up. Shortly after Master P bounced out to New Orleans, most artists that were in No Limit (but not hooked in with Tru) hooked up in small indie lables to drop albums. Lil Ric went with Solo Records and dropped Wicked Streets which was by far his best CD to date...including his newer ""Thug Nut"". If you want the R-I-C at his absolute best...get this album (if you can find it). Smooth flows, and laid back beats that hit from beginning to end. From an era when it was all about Bay Area collaberation, it features B-Legit, E40, and many others that did what they had to to support the Bay. Wish things were still like that..."
2,this album aint that good,"When I heard that ""lil ric"" had a new album i thought it would be as good as the one he came out with a couple years ago on NO LIMIT RECORDS, that album was called ""DEEP N THA GAME"", that was a tight album !! This disapointed me, it had like 2 good songs, dont waste you're money on this album, if u like down south rappers check out ""shell shocked"" from MAC, that's one of ma faves, and u can buy it right here..., ANYWAYS, I WOULD PASS ON THIS 1, PEACE"
1,Almost no taste,"I'm very disappointed in this product. It has almost no taste, regardless of how much you put in. I guess I will stick to cheaper brands as I'm not sure how they justify the $16 for this."
1,Beginner's??? I don't think so...,"I went thru the first five chapters on this book and then decided to move on to another book. This is not a beginner's book, it is more like a grammar reference book. If you are really new to the language like me I suggest you go with ""Czech Step by Step"" by Lida Hola. It is more expensive but it is MORE usefull, I've learned more in just the first lesson than on the first 5 on ""Beginer's Czech"". If you try to learn with this book you will think that it is an impossible language... my advice... get another book!"
2,Broken Vow,"This book started off great but I found myself disappointed as I continued reading. Often times, it was difficult to keep track of which character was speaking. This was frustrating as I would have to stop reading and return to the beginning of the chapter to find the speaker.There were some great scenes throughout the book but not enough to keep my interest. I simply didn't care enough about characters to find out how things turned out in the end"
2,Terrible Book,"I could appreciate the plot of this book, with me being single and having single friends. But I felt like the characters were so sterotypical of black characters in all the all black books...you always have that one that is gorgeous but is a ""hoe"" and has many men taking care of her. Then you have the really smart one, who is career driven but thinks she's really above everyone else and then the one with the baby daddy....I had some semi respect for Vivian, when she started working on herself, FOR herself, but then she went backwards and ended upwith her baby daddy anyway....I was dissapointed, and glad that I didn't buy this book! I would have taken it back and gotten my money....."
1,The Vow. A Novel,"Actually, I didn't read it, because it isn't The Vow I thought I was ordering. I still haven't found the right one."
4,The Vow,"Three friends vow at another friend's wedding that they are going to find husbands within the next year. Women like Trista, Amaya, and Vivian don't come around a lot, so any man would be lucky to have them. Trista, the Hollywood agent, who is accomplishing everything she set out to do. Amaya, emerging actress who wants just one man, problem: he's married. And Vivian, she has been pining over her baby daddy since the moment she met him, if only she could get him to return the feelings instead of just meeting up for ""ex-sex"". Will the women be able to accomplish The Vow, or are they meant for other things."
3,The Vow--An ASiS Book Club Review,"The concept of The Vow was very intriguing. It was interesting to look in depth into the lives of Trista, Amaya and Vivian and to watch as they attempted to bring their pact to fruition. ASiS book club members were amazed at how three authors could come to together to and web one story. These authors should be applauded for their efforts. Although, The Vow started off a bit slow and had much more bread than meat, it kept you glued to the pages to find out how it ends. Kudos to Denene Millner,Angela Burt-Murray and Mitzi Miller for a job well done."
5,Is there going to be a sequel?,"I am a voracious reader and this is the first book I've read in a long time that I couldn't put down! I read it everywhere-at work, in the car, while I was cooking, in line at the store. It is obvious that all three authors are strong writers, who can create believable, interesting and compelling characters. I can't wait to read their next project. Buy this book. I promise you you won't be disappointed!"
2,Not the right picture,FYI--the picture is the bunk bed which is $399. The description is for 1 trundle bed that would fit under the lower level of the bunk bed.
5,Awesome!,"Everything I expected AND MORE in this little pocket pc. All the functionalities you need in your everyday life as well as everything you could possibly wish for in a portable device: WiFi, Bluetooth, IR, etc. I couldn't be more pleased about this device! Highly recommended for all users!!!"
1,Never worked--terrible customer service,"I ordered an HP iPAQ 4155 online on Nov 27 and received it on Dec 4 just in time to take it with me on a business trip overseas from which I returned just before Christmas. The 4155 never worked--the only screen that ever appeared was the alignment screen. Due to the holidays, I didn't get around to calling HP Technical Service until Jan 8. HP confirmed that the 4155 didn't work and told me that it could be repaired but not replaced because it was more than 30 days since the purchase date(35 days after receipt).HP TA said that the case had to go to Customer Relations to appeal for a new one.Hearing nothing by Jan 21, I called and HP said no customer relat no. was available & to wait one more week to hear from them. I am very unhappy with HP service to date."
1,Get a Palm.,When I got up today I found my iPAQ 4155 with a melted screen. Sometime in the night sitting on it's base it just died. Called support and was told that it was a common thing to have happen. Then I was told that it would be $175.00 to fix it. I'm now going out and getting a Palm. I wish I would have saved my money.
1,buyer beware,"do your homework before you buy this device!! it is primarily / solely for folks who work in a wi-fi shop....or spend their life in starbucks. getting it enabled to go on a wireless network is a nightmare...and do not count on the new compaq tech team to be helpful...i spoke to them 3 times, rec'd 3 different ideas on how to proceed. i finally just returned the pretty device. i likened it to a date who looked great but was dysfunctional...."
1,"iPQA 4155 is too fragile, shatters when dropped",The iPAQ 4155 is a perfect palmtop for you if you never drop anything. Previous HP palmtops that I've owned have been sturdy and could handle being dropped even in parking lots. I accidentally dropped the iPAQ 4155 in my house two months after purchase. It shattered. I had made the mistake of not purchasing an accidental damage warranty ($100/year). HP support was unhelpful and rude and expensive.
1,Screen Breaks and it will.,"All the good reviews are from people that have just purchased this item. Wait till the screen breaks by its self.I have owned 5 ipaqs, starting with the Aero and going all the way to 4155.One day I looked at my ipaq and it had a crack on the screen about 1 inch long. I knew immediately that the crack will grow and it did.The unit has never been dropped or mishandeled. Its does not even have a scratch on it. I am a person that uses a super fine tip fiber tip for my regular writing and never exert any pressure on the pen, letalone the stylus.The crack came by its self and now the repair costs are in excess of 180 $.After reading all the people that have broken their ipaq screens I am thinking of filing a class action law suit against HP. They should provide free screen replacements to their customers. (something similar to what compaq had to do to replace all floppy drives for their customers)I will try to setup a blog page where we can get together and sue the company.[...]"
3,"nice piece of hardware, but no 2003SE update","The 4155 is a very nice hardware. Good design and high quality manufactured. The mixture of features (WLan, Bluetooth, Irda, changable akku) combined in such a tiny and lightwight device is impressive.But reading that HP decided they will NOT supply upgrades of Pocket PC 2003 Second Edition for this device makes me thinking that I should have bought something else..."
5,Phenomenal Product,"A couple of days ago I decided to make the big leap from Palm (i.e. Handspring Visor) to PocketPC - and am I glad I did! Not only is there the obvious parallel of going from black to color, but the ease of synching ALL of my necessary files (especially Outlook) without having to go through mediator interfaces (e.g. DataViz and Chapura) is fantastic. All of the data comes through (not just truncated), and it is extremely legible.The third-party applications and data sources give it an enormous breath and functionality. But the deciding factor for this particular model was: no antenna to stick out, and yet both BlueTooth and Wi-Fi compatible.Have no doubt about purchasing this excellent productivity tool - you will not regret it!"
4,Ipaq 4155,"I have the ipaq 4155 for 1 week now, replacing my dell axim5 that I did love. But the size of the 4155 changes everything : its always in my pocket rather than in my briefcase.My screen is not yellowish, little clearer and sharper than the Axim5 one. Application much faster, including videos and flight sim. Wifi works fine, Bluetooth not tested yet.I really love it, very happy having buying it.Minors Cons (to find some) :- HP case : not to big, acceptable but not wonderfull (I'd like flap like clié or first palm III)- the stylus is hard to get form its hole (you need nails...)- plugging to the cradle is not very resistant and clever (you scratch the cradle every time and landing is difficult)NB : As no accessories for the 4100 family are in stores yet, I bought a HP1910 sync and charge cable to synchronise at home and it works fine !Messenger needs a patch to work, and hp picture viewer is excellent."
3,its alright,it was slow to ship but that's the only thing of note the table looks just like it does in the pictures and the wood almost feals like plastic
5,A Very Interesting Book,"First of all, I have no idea what the other reviewers are talking about. The thing to realize here is that this is an interesting work of international relations theory. The work is great in its methodology and presents relevant and unique empirical findings (unlike some/many of the recent academic work on the democratic peace). Even though I disagree with some of the work's findings, I appreciate it for what it is and could care less about all of the odd comments from the other reviewers."
4,Nice Media Player.,This was a nice media player I bought for my daughter for Christmas. It is a little tricky getting movies to play and sync. Must find the right combo. Has a good amount of features. How ever my daughter droped it and crack the LCD screen. To bad because I really like this media player.
1,"hate to say it, but confusing drivel","I don't know if the other reviewers read the same book I did, but this book slogged through random descriptions that seemed to go nowhere, tried to make a point about these people's lives that never really came to anything for me. It messed around in terms of timeline, jumping all over the place with no real effect except confusion. I got to the end and still didn't really get the point. All the characters seemed either clueless, or cruel, or otherwise extremely hurtful to everyone in their lives. In his twisted way the narrator tries to get us to forgive them for this, but in my case fails. I would not recommend that anyone take the time with this book getting to the end, and hoping, like I did, that somehow it would come together. You'll get to the last page and be disappointed."
2,A BIT OUTDATED.,"I bought it to try and rescue data and pictures from an old broken nokia phone. It did not work as described by the manufacturer. The instructions clearly state that a ""free"" software download is needed from the nokia website. This is where I explain (outdated). Almost all new laptops have some sort of wireless technology such as WiFi or bluetooth, So do nokia phones, this is how you can connect to the computer a free downloadable software. If for whatever reason you need a cable then by all means this is the product for you."
1,I'm not a billboard,"The picture shows the BACK of the hat. There's no indication that the logo and the words ""snake eyes"" are stitched on the FRONT of the hat. While the hat is both lightweight and a bit stretchy for a good fit, I'm not a billboard, and don't/won't wear things that double as such. And I now have to pay s/h both ways."
1,Nothing here for developers,"If you are looking to learn RIAs and are coming from a non Flash background skip this book. There is absolutely nothing here about the huge differences between developing Flash apps and developing in more conventional application environemnts under say, Java, or C#. Even basic things like structuring code (on frames, or central, use of timeline) are glossed over completely. There is no mention of the new Flash MX Pro 2004 screen or forms. There isn't even a discussion of preloading issues and transition between user interfaces. Over all I only found one useful thing in the book, and that would have been found just by doing a better read of the macromedia documentation. Very disappointing. This book is a big reason I try not to buy online. Had I leafed through this at a store I would have not brought it home."
5,RIAs in : ) Refreshing web pages out : (,"A truly down to earth book. It covers the programming aspects in easy to understand and real users lingo. Almost reads my mind as to when to throw in a 'cool exercise' to show the benifits of the particular section. I've read numerous books on Flash RIA development but this one is the one that makes it all seem simple in retrospect. The data is flowing!Well done, Phillip. You've moved to the top of my list for authors in Flash."
3,"Good theoretical book, to few practical examples.","This is one of the first FMX 04 books that was out, so I ordered it to get updated asap;I enjoyed reading the book, but it wasn't what I was looking for.It talks at length about how and why to build RIAs, but the practical examples (AS2 code) were not enough, it's too much theory.I much prefered his ""ActionScripting in Flash"" book, and even that one was very theoretical.For AS2 and all the new stuff, I'd recommend the Macromedia Press Books.But then the book's title is MX 04 for RIAs, the problem is, you can't scan through the book on the web before buying, and returning an item from France is not really usefull.."
3,Give the author a break,"Personally, I expected much more from this book when I first ordered it, however I realize now that at the time the author was writing the book, Macromedia was still developing this app. With that realization in mind I think that this book does a good job in giving an overview of what is new and exciting with Flash 2004.It is apparent that with the first release of 2004, that Macromedia itself was not ready (hell, the documentation for the application is continually updated as we speak), so how is someone going to give in-depth, detailed information that was probably ""vaporware"" when he was writing it. I think the author should be praised for hitting the publishing date, no one else has.That being said, sure I expected more, but I do not think I wasted my money. This book gave me some very good insight on where to concentrate going forward and I think was a useful and productive investement."
2,An advert not a book,Throughout the book the author keeps on singing an re-singing the praises and benefits of using the Flash but without any substantiative hands-on examples. It is the only book that I returned out of some dozen and a half books that I bought in the past year.
1,Not happy..,"This book did not meet my expectations at all,I own 30 other Flash books and this was the first real disappointment.Not that it is badly written, I like the style,it's just that the content doesn't get me what the title suggest;the largest part of this book is about project managment, good practices, debugging etc,instead I was hoping to find some real examples with sourcecode explained,how to code RIAs, which components to use, what the new Classes are for and how to write my own for these RIAs;this is sometimes touched, but never fully developed.Also, the inclusion of 2 entire chapters on Flash Com might be very interesting for some;I skipped these coz I don't know of any affordable hosting for a personal website which features this with their hosting plan..No need to learn a technology if you can't use it (and forget localhost, what good is an app' on your local comp when it's s'posed to be on the internet..).It's a nice read, just not usefull enough from a practical point of view."
5,Silver Speck & Box Chains... THE BEST!,"I always look at what type of chain comes with any pendant I buy. If it's not a box chain, I immediately go to Silver Speck and order a box chain. Box chains always seem to be the strongest and most secure. When it comes to great quality, great deals, and great service for silver, I have never been disappointed by Silver Speck. RE: chains, I can find any kind of chain in any length at Silver Speck for an amazing price. Highly recommended!!"
3,OK part of a series.,As an over 50 multi-marathoner I found this text lacking in some areas. It seemed to address a target market but missed because it assumed that all runners are speed motivated and were fast runners in early years. Most of today's distance runners are neither.
4,"Dated, but still relevant","I've run a lot of years. Not fast (e.g., never had any hope of qualifying for Boston), but steady (e.g., I've run every Bridge to Bridge Run in San Francisco since its inception over 33 years ago). Changes in life circumstances, aging...forces beyond our control have a gradual but profound effect on our running. Published in 1998, some aspects of Benyo's book are a bit dated, most evident in the photos and in some of the biographical sketches. However, overall, the information and advice in the book are still valuable, and they have helped me to re-evaluate how I approach this avocation that has for so long been a part of my life. Who knows, maybe there's still a marathon left in me after all."
3,cheaply made,"This pet pillerBullseye Pillgunmay be effective about 70 percent of the time ,I had one that looked very similar(for a decade or more ) to feed my chronic cat his pills,the rubber eventually dried out ,This was as close as i could find ,but it is difficult to keep the long plunger stick inside the device and it doesnt seem to reach the pill always,as if its not long enough ,or too slender to be effective also you can shoot small pill portions .It is better than nothing ,but the old one I had far exceeded this in effectiveness ,quality and durability"
1,Not as pictured nor size described,"This is my third purchase of an exact pill gun. The one in the picture shows the dark navy blue tip, which is the one that I use. What arrived is the cheap version with a teal tip and it falls apart after few uses. Having a canine child with bone cancer, I require the exact pill gun that I ordered and this was not. The item I purchased from this particular place does not work. Prior to purchase, contact the vendor and ask for specifics. That way, you will get exactly what you require. I did not do this so I had to repurchase the item, pictured, elsewhere."
2,Slow boat to nowhere - I wanted to disembark,"Despite the considerable collective thespian skills of the 3 primary actors (Sophia Loren, Richard Burton, Ian Bannen) playing the major roles, the slogging trek of the ""The Voyage"" is not worth the travel time. It is too slow. The occasional scenic glimpses of Italy and the music were nice, but the latter ruined by the horrible sound quality on DVD. Love scenes between R.B. and S.L. were amazingly without chemistry, lending credibility to a statement made by R.B. during an interview with Dick Cavett in which he (RB) claimed that he could not ""make love on the screen."""
5,Very Sweet Book.,"Simple, but sweet. Great rhyming pattern-reads very smoothly. I love to read this to my young children to help them understand why Daddy is gone all day & that he is doing it for us! Then we talk about our Daddy's work & how he does it out of love & how happy he is when he gets home to see us! When I ask my 1-year-old where Daddy is, he says ""Daddy work"". I recommend it for all young children with Daddies who work!"
3,Good read for a class requirement,"So I ended up ordering this book because I needed to read an ethnography for my anthropology class and present on it. It talks about different culture the author had visited and he provides interesting experiences and cases of what happens in these places. It was an okay book, better than the others choices I had."
5,The world's best accordionist--Great Artist!!,"Flaco is the world's best accordist and he shows it in this CD...with his versatility of music and songs he played in it. ""Recuerda"" is a beautiful heartbreaking love song, then ""Soulmates"" an Instrumental is just out of this world, of course the country songs are great. Every one should have this CD! It is one of his best! And has something for everybody's taste of music. And he projects the great personality and charisma and very much talent that he has and the love of music that is in his blood. And so does Nunie Rubio, his vocalist, together they are simply fantastic!!!! There is no question why Flaco has won 5 grammys and numerous other awards Can hardly wait for his new upcoming CD."
2,TOO SLICK FOR ME,"This is Flaco watered down, like bad salsa, for gringos - the trademark runs are few, the songs tend toward modern (i.e. wimpy) country rather than traditional conjunto and the whole thing sounds more like a sappy Rick Trevino or Mavericks production. Go for his earlier recordings if you want to hear why Flaco is the master."
5,My Friend,May you sing with the angels now Vestal. You will be missed by all of us remaining here until that glorious day. God Bless You
5,Simply Fun,"I purchased this game about two years ago and I love it. I was pretty addicted to it and then stopped for a while and started up again and have two more casinos to unlock.This game is cool. It probably wouldn't be impressive to frequent gamers with respect to graphics and such. However, to someone like myself who doesn't play a lot of video games, it is simple to play and fun building up the casinos. Also when you put in wedding chapels and other amenities, you can see a different array of characters moving about your casino. I think its interesting and fun to watch.The game is listed here for a really low price. I think it's worth it for the entertainment."
4,Casino Empire,"Fun game can get a little slow at times, make sure you read some strategies online before playing."
3,Overall Good Game,"I bought this game in a 2 pack with hoyle slots. I like this game. I don't like the fact that you cannot change the casino itself. This game is very entertaining but sometimes a little difficult, but who wants it to be easy. The casino sounds are good and so are the graphics. So all in all worth the money."
3,It's ok,"This game is pretty cool at first. There is a lot of graphic detail in regards to the casino and the games. You are given a lot of control over the table game prices, locations, payouts, etc. The only problem is there are only 8 casinos you get to play, with specific goals to accomplish. Or you can play freestyle. The casino interior cannot be changed, and so you run out of space for placing things like buffets, restrooms, etc. Its not a very challenging game at all, I finished it in a day. It is really funny though, when you click on your patrons they usually have something unique and comical to say."
3,Gets old....fast...,"The only probably with this game, is it's too short. There are 8, relatively easy levels to beat. And once you've done that, the game is pretty much down. Do yourself a favor, check for a 'used' copy first...then sell it as used once you're done with it."
2,The old version was better...,"I have the original UK book from the '70's and have used it so much it's falling apart. It has some wonderful recipes that have become family favorites. I was prepared to throw it away for the newer version. But when I got it and started looking through it, I was disappointed. It's got nicer font than the old one but I thought in a newer version there would be color photos. Nope. And they have trimmed some of the content! I was kind of upset! So it really isn't the same book I thought I was getting. So for now I keep using the old book in the boring font with no photos but with the 20 or so pages included that they didn't see fit to print in the new version. And I'll just keep taping in those pesky pages that keep falling out..."
5,The Bean Book,This lady is a wonderful addition your your cook books if you have any allergies or like me - gluten free. Very nice recipes and interesting combinations of foods. Love it!!!!
3,BUTTER COOKIES ANYONE?,"It smells like butter cookies, not something I want in a fragrance. Definitely a fragrance for a teen. Won't be purchasing again."
1,"Stick to magazines, Ms. Forden","Yes, the Gucci story is intriguing. And yes, Ms. Forden provides some historical facts. But remember, this is a book. It should be readable. Ms. Forden's constant and trivial inclusion of far too much 'stuff' is more annoying than enlightening.This book could be condensed into 200 pages. Thoughtfully written and entertaining by someone other than Ms. Forden. It is a laborious task to tread through the boring an completely unnecessary details. Ms. Forden, no one cares about the work history of then-Head-of BergdorfGoodman.Poorly written, this book is one long magazine article. Paragraph after paragraph of unnecessary filler. I suggest you find some other way to capture the history of the Gucci company."
3,Fabric and thread,"And all this time I thought that fashion was just about fabric and thread! _The_House_of_Gucci_ was a terrific read because of all of the novela-style twists and turns and because of the way that it expertly documents the history of a family, an industry and an era. I suppose that one of the morals of the story is ""be careful who you marry"" but another is sure to be ""there's always a new revenue stream."" I especially appreciated the background information regarding the family members and the hired hands like Tom Ford and Domenico De Sole as this information really gave the story the sort of depth that similar accounts lack. This book is proof positive that in business, as in life, there is usually more to the story than meets the (customer's) eye."
2,Not engaging - reads like a reference book at times,"I read a lot of non-fiction and thought this would be a fascinating read. It was one of those books that had an interesting basic storyline, but unfortunately, was written more like a reference book at times. I felt that the author did a great deal of research and wanted to stuff all the facts into the book, whether or not they were relevant to the main story (or at all interesting). This made it tedious at times. I seem to remember too many trivial details bogging things down. I'm afraid I was bored. I commend the author for the hard work. I just wish it had been a more focused effort on making it an interesting read."
1,Boring!,"I found this book to be so tedious, filled with unnecessary details and way too many characters. I could not finish it, so my advice is to skip this one."
5,the house of gucci,"This book reads like a novel, but is in fact the true story of the the Gucci family, of their triumphs and tribulations; culminating in the murder of one of tneir most favored sons. The author can WRITE, is familiar with the fashion business, knows Italy and did a massive amount of meticulous research. Excellent."
3,Interesting,"Interesting is about all I can say for this book. If you want to knowall about the running of the business of Gucci, this book will rewardyou amply. Know before hand if you think most of the book is aboutthe murder of Maurizio Gucci, there are not that many details. The Gucci family and what they acheived is a marvel. Guccio, the founder andthen his sons created a dynasty. They were such hard workers andseemingly all of them extremely talented in the fashion business.It is sad the way this dynasty crumbled down. I,m reminded of the oldnursery rhyme-Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humptytogether again."
3,The amazing world of fashion & business,"This book details the ups and downs of Gucci from the very beginning. If you don't know much about the world of fashion and business, you will learn alot!!! The inner world of Gucci, the business side, was at times a bit tiring to read about. What was missing from the tale was a more in depth look at some key figures surrounding the murdered Maurizio Gucci. His business partners and acquaintances were clearly portrayed..... however, his immediate family (wife Patrizia and two daughters) appeared to be shadowy figures appearing here and there in the book. A few more chapters to paint a clearer picture of Maurizio's personal life would have been satisfying. Overall an interesting book."
4,"quality doorknob, four star packaging","I'm replacing the same brand of knob so they have been easy to install, Schlage seems to make quality items. The packaging is sufficient, but it does allow some small surface scratches. Could be better, but I'd still recommend these."
3,Ex-Black Flag Sludge Rock,"Probably one of the better overlooked Ex-Black Flag bands. This sounds a lot like Black Flag's 'Process of Weeding Out' EP. All of the songs are instrumental and certainty has the Black Flag guitar sound. The drums sound a little like Big Black (drum machine), but it is all heavy instrumental music. Not to be missed if you are a Black Flag fan."
4,I am hooked !!!!,"A friend gave me this CD for my birthday last year and I love it !! It really ""grows"" on you. It is full of contemporary Christian music with a blend of favorite hymns that everyone knows. A good mix of Christian music, in my opinion - something for everyone. I liked it so well that I have given it as a birthday present for two of my friends this year."
4,good deal for a DVD/CD/VideoCD/MP3/DVD-R/CD-R/CD-RW player,"Great model for this price. When my friends came to visit,they were all amazed becasue this UN-EXPENSIVE one can play not only DVDs or VCDs,it can also play MP3s. It means that I don't need to change audio CDs for the BACKGROUND music while we are chatting since one CD can record more than 100 MP3 files and it can be played for several hours. I would say this one can be a extremly good deal for people who have tight budget but want to enjoy the convinience of technology."
3,Not bad,I gave this to my parents about 5 years ago. They recently had to replace it because the DVD tray doesn't work anymore. Kind of disappointing. They don't make stuff like they use to.
2,Misleading Reviews,"It is pathetic and distressing that the reviews here aren't edited for truth value.This DVD player DOES NOT play VCDs. It plays only DVD, CDAUDIO and MP3.I got RIPPED. I have a bunch of VCDs to play and this one's a waste."
1,"NOT the ""ORIGINAL""","Revlon changed this classic, timeless scent (NOT ""ORIGINAL"" as bottle says), and it didn't work!! I had seen the many comments on this and other sites, and decided to test it out for myself. I bought a new bottle, and splashed a handful of it on one arm, then splashed a handful from my old bottle on the other arm. I was amazed to find such a change - the new formula is awful! The fresh, spicy scent with the almost musky accent is completely gone. I could blend rancid lemon juice and some 50-year-old old talcum powder and produce something similar to this new scent. YUCK!! BAD JOB, REVLON! Maybe I'll come back to try it again in a year or so, though I doubt they'll listen to us and go back to the REAL ORIGINAL. I'm really going to miss my old Jean Nate!"
1,it stinks,"I have been wearing Jean Nate for something like 45 years or so (I know its been a long time) Then I ran into it at Walgreens and bought a bottle of the Splash. I tried it and it STUNK! What happened???? I tried it again, same stink as before. Then tried it on my daughter and mom to see if perhaps my body chemistry changed and made it smell bad on me. But it stunk on my mom and daoughter too! So, now I am researching the smelly Splash product on line and see that more ladies think also like me: the new Jean Nate Splash STINKS. I have used it 2 days now and gotta take it back for a refund or return it to Revlon. All I know is that i cannot wear the new scent. Please bring back the ORIGINAL Jean Nate Splash...please!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,What were they thinking?,"I've been using Jean Nate After Bath Splash my entire life, and have loved it and introduced it to friends and family, but my recent purchase smelled completely different. REVLON, DON'T MESS WITH A CLASSIC!!! I will never buy this product again unless they change the formula back to the original. What would possess them to make this change? Either create a new product with a new name, or leave the original as is. Did you think we wouldn't NOTICE???"
2,"Jean Nate Has Changed, and Not For the Better...","I have always loved Jean Nate after bath splash. It's so refreshing particularly in the summertime. I had read some of the reviews saying the formula had changed, but couldn't think of a good alternative so I went ahead and ordered some. The other reviewers are absolutely right - the formula has changed! I still had a little bit of the ""old"" Jean Nate in a travel bottle and compared. The new stuff doesn't even smell remotely like the true original Jean Nate. I'm giving it two stars because there is one good quality that remains - when you splash it on it does feel cool (although I imagine rubbing alcohol, which smells as good as this stuff, would work as well and cost a lot less). I just can't understand why Revlon would change what was once a fantastic product, but I do know I'm now on the hunt for an alternative that smells decent."
1,"""Ya think Revlon would've learned from the 'New Coke"" fiasco!","The new formula is TERRIBLE!!!!! ALL YOU CAN SMELL is the ALCOHOL. A saleslady said my perfume smelled ""woodsy"" because it was so offensive a smell. REVLON, are you listening? Revlon, do you really care about the comments of your most loyal female customers? No woman wants to smell like she has been out in the woods for weeks with your ""new formula""!!!! Enough said and written!!!!!"
1,They changed the scent - phew!,"I've loved Jean Nate for years. I was in the mood for an little indulgence, and I bought a bottle. It smells like horse. I am so disappointed that they changed the scent. It used to be so elegant."
5,Summer Jean Nate Is Refreshing,"I love Jean Nate in Summer. It has a pleasant lemon scent and you do not need to use very much. It will last all season. I apply it on my neck, arms, and feet. It has camphor in it, so the bugs stay away. It is refreshing right after a bath or shower and at bedtime. It is also very good for any oily skin areas. It is cooling for the hot spots. It also comes as a powder which is nice for an added touch. It absolutely repels gnats and mosquitoes. August is the best time to purchase this product for next Spring/Summer. Enjoy!"
1,Why did you change the Jean Nate Splash??????,"REVLON what have you done??????????? to the Jean Nate Body Splash. This Jean Nate splash is nothing, I repeat nothing like the Product I have used since the 60's. It smells like bug spray now. I use to get compliments from complete strangers asking what I was wearing every single time I wore it. I was asked what perfume did I wear? The Old Jean nate Splash that I used lasted all day and into the AM I could still smell traces of it on my wrists.The new Splash is offensive, it acutally made my stomach turn after I had it on awhile. Please, please, please bring back the old frangrance. I will buy several. I bought 3 bottles on sale and will be returning the two bottle I didnt open to Walgreens... because of the way it smells now ughhhhhhh.... Why did you try to fix something that wasnt broken. :("
1,very bad service,"When I went to get my parcel at the Post Office, the parcel was all wet, so I asked the clerk to return it. I'm still waiting for another bottle to be sent to me. Thanks!Nicole Tetreault"
2,The Design is Great!,"I order the charger and I had to send it back, because it did not charge at all, maybe it was defected I hope so, because is a shame. I like it very much because of the lights at the end of the cables, but Sorry. Don't ship any more Defected products!Sincerely,C.A. Saint Louis, MO"
2,Hopeless,"This scanty little volume barely even begins to get to grips with the complexity of Rosalind Krauss's writing. It gives the impression of something David Carrier knocked off on his vacation, completely lacking in any rigourous engagement with Krauss, and full of vacuous comments like ""Hmm, Rosalind Krauss is often controversial, but she is always interesting!"" Well, thanks for that Professor Carrier, you should really do a lot better than this. Krauss is barely even quoted properly either, for some kind of legal reasons mentioned in the preface. This contributes to the lack of seriousness which characterises this slim and ultimately unhelpful study. And what's more, it costs $90!! You would be completely out of your mind to pay that kind of money for this book."
5,A 5 Star Winner,I really enjoyed this book. The author keeps you on the edge of your seat while talking of the Rebel's attempting to escape from prison. The book is a real easy read and personnaly I had trouble putting it down. I highly reccomend this book.
2,Cling Shade,"Nothing educational or fun about it. It provides a dora picture for the kids to look at whilst protecting them from the suns rays. Also has a heat sensor on it, glows white when vehicle is too warm for children which is always useful.Be sure to follow instructions when attaching to window, can help avoid bubbles."
1,dont like it,"cool looking but not what i expected, i think it should be little brushes instead of end to put a rag around"
2,Okay... I guess...,"Honestly, I thought these were going to be different. I don't know when you would ever use them. I thought the tips were going to be rubber/soft, instead they are hard plastic."
3,Won't buy again,"These tags are difficult to write on because of a glossy finish. They made my jewelry look classy, but I won't buy them again. The seller is great to work with."
4,good size.,"These are the perfect size, the only thing is that you have to write the price on with a felt tip pen. A regular pen does not work. The do look really classy on the jewelry though and the price was right."
1,not what I expected,"I didn't look carefully enough before I bought this - it's my fault. But beware. These are not the original performers in many cases but tired versions of the groups. The Fifth Dimension, the band I wanted to see, has only two original members in this DVD. Even when it's the original members, they sound anemic and old. Do not buy this if you're looking for any sort of quality of performance - these wheezing memories of the original performers are not easy to look at or listen to."
4,Virtually Unlistenable,"That's right. Virtually unlistenable and incredible good. It goes right up to the line. How many times is he going to play that riff? Just when you think it's exhausted, or you're exhausted, there's a variation--exactly the right one. The album's an aquired taste, but worth it. Angular, jagged, convulsive, controlled, constrained. It focuses in on a very narrow musical spaace and explores it with great intensity and imagination. You start off not being able to live with it, and before you know it, you're addicted to some of the most innovative instrumental work by today's most important rock guitarist."
4,A good supplement for a well trained investor,"This book offers an excellent introduction to the mechanics of online investing. Don't look for the secret to successful investment results. But if you already have the basics of asset allocation and markets, it is a well written how-to guide to assist you in dramatically lowering your transaction costs. But hurry...this information will become stale at lightning speed."
3,The Music And Songs Seriously Save This Poor Movie,"This movie is not good , the plot is below average, the acting is poor the special effects boring, but! the songs written by Richard O'Brien of ""rocky horror"" fame are great and,it is worth watching tjis movie for the songs and music alone!, or watch it with friends if you want to see how they react to this very strange movie."
5,A Chill CD,"Great CD to sing along to. Ignore your previous conceptions about what music is and you will love this album (unless you're into death metal or something then this CD will be torture to you). But yeah anyways it's a really chill, mellowed out album with a lot of really catchy songs like ""love you"", ""here I go"", and ""octopus"". Even though his style is a lot different I enjoy listening to early Pink Floyd with Syd Barrett and his solo's even more than the later Floyd albums so in my opinion this CD kicks [butt]."
4,syd as it should be...,"With some doubts as to the overall song-writing quality i was a bit apprehensive before listening to Syd's solo non-floyd debut, but more to my surprise it turned out to be quite the album more on a mellow scale...while not as acomplished as Waters and Gilmours solo albums, Barrett shows what the aforementioned dont always achieve - genuine and unbrideled emotion coupled with sheer honesty. In some tracks Barrett sounds as if he had never sung a note before in his life i.e. ""If its in you"" and on others such as ""Octopus"" he has never sounded better. The inconsistent attributes of this album do not take away as one might derive but add to the uniqueness of this album making it oneof those albums that grow after repeated listening's. Overall quite good giving his earlier such albums as ""piper"" a run for its money."
5,Isn't good to be lost in the Woods,"Syd's first solo album is the closest studio attempt at capturing his magic. This album was made at just the right time in Syd's career, inbetween utter madness and pedestrian sanity. Although it shows that he didn't put very much time and effort into getting the cuts down, his ideas and his messages still shine brightly through the album. There are definite traces of the wall in this album especially in Dark Globe. Haunting title if you know what it means."
4,Madcap Laughs erns its title,"This album is a must for any Floyd fan or any fan of Indi or Alternitive music. It shows us the carefree feelings of artist and the fragmantation of the mind, which in pieces can beautifuly odd and abstract."
5,quirky erratic tinglings,"Very strange songwriting, to be sure. It has that kind of elusiveness, where you like it, and then again, not really, but then you know there's something there, and by the time you're on your 3rd listen, you're hooked. Same thing with the Smiths and Robyn Hitchcock, but this album is, I feel, a little better than all of that. ha! Wonderfully arranged song structures that have the perfected craftsmanship I-know-what-goes-where of the Beach Boys and the Beatles without being overly casual as Guided by Voices are. Kind of like the perfect balance between the perfectionistic virtues of a classical Chinese poet and the prolific brilliance of Shakespeare. But this isn't exactly a pop album of those sorts, it's just.. something of its own, just as Pipers..Dawn was. Incredible."
4,Highly inacessible masterpeice (3.5 stars),"This is a great album, but it will appeal to only about one in a thousand people. Syd had truly lost his mind in a sea of acid and music-hall reminisences. He created some mad, yet beautiful and even deep pop tunes. I hate Pink Floyd, but I love Syd. It will not click on the first listen. If it doesn't click on the second listen, check out the more acessible ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"", and than try again. If on the fifth try it still doesn't click, just give up, because this obviously will not appeal to you."
2,a great disappointment from a supposedly great genius,"when i saw this in the cd shop, i gasped in excitement.you see, i've never knew syd released some solo albums after pink floyd.i love his songs in the pf albums, the 66,67 singles and the piper album.those great melodies and moody lyrics.obviously i grabbed this first solo work.when i played it,i fell on my face!those great hooks and melodies were gone!and he seemed to be just playing his guitar all alone,sounds more like a demo.anyway i know some love this, well not as bad as those crappy boy bands i hear nowadays, but could have been better with more polished arrangement."
4,Not great music but a great experience,"Of course, Syd is no bach no Zappa but he stands on a hill of his own. From the mind comes a true glimps of a soul being slowly taken apart. Yes, there are off key songs but the lyrics and the dark beauti takes the mind willing to go to another world. Actually, ever been in a studio and forgot the words to what you're singing or realized you screwed up? I have and there ya go. I also have read that after David gilmore took over he put in things to make the effort sound even more wacked out. Get the cd, it's a trip to heave and ho!"
1,Druggies need not apply,"Sorry, never understood Syd, nor can I feel sorry for him. His music was at best, a training bra for Pink Floyd. No disrespect intended, except for being a founding member, he didn't count for much."
4,The best of the trio,"As an avid fan of Pink Floyd, I make it my business to own every CD whether solo or otherwise. The Madcap Laughs is by far Syd's best outside of Pink Floyd, so get this first rather than Opel or Barrett.Definitely Recommended."
5,avid pink fan,to me aguably one of syds best Cd's although not realy worth the extra money for the few new tracks
2,Listen before buying,"Being a Pink Floyd fan in the 60's (and still am today), I immediately bought this album when it first came out. Syd Barrett was THE man behind Pink Floyd, or so I thought. On playing it, and giving it many plays, I was very disappointed. It was obviously a noble effort by his former bandmates to prop him up. There are a couple of interesting songs, but aside from some historical value, it's not worth the pain to listen to. After nearly 40 years since it's release, I thought I'd give it another shot and borrowed it from the library. My opinion hasn't changed. I still love Pink Floyd, but this Syd Barrett solo effort, even with the help of his talented friends, is just plain awful. My advice is to rent it or borrow it before buying."
3,"Nothing to write home about, but worth a listen","If anything, ""The Madcap Laughs"" is aptly titled. It's just that...mad! Syd Barrett was most certainly dancing on that thin line between reality and delusion when he wrote and recorded his 1970 album as evident in his monotonous voice, lazy guitar picking, inconsistent rhythm playing and (at times) incoherent lyrics.On most of the tracks, the inconsistency and delusion makes for some pretty groovy lava lamp listening (the haunting ""Golden Hair"" and melancholy ""Long Gone"" for instance). On others, it's just plain stupid (Love You being the perfect examplePsychedelic and (in particular) Pink Floyd fans should, by all means check it out. But I warn you, don't expect Piper At The Gates of Dawn."
3,Not Floyd,"Bought this because I am an enormous pink floyd fan and read reviews that, in this case, Madcap is a must have. I was disappointed in the CD overall mostly due to its more pop-oriented tracks that lack the variety of percussion and synthisizer that make the early floyd albums great. Octopus is a catchy tune, but most of the others fail to engage. As a whole: an interesting album, but lacks the creativity of any of the Floyd productions."
2,You Gotta Be Kidding Me,"Some people must be blinded by the hype. I loved ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" but this CD should be played to middle school students to scare them off of drugs. Play ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and say ""This is Pink Floyd"", then play this and say, ""this is Pink Floyd on Drugs."" The kids will never take a baby aspirin again. Six of the songs are listenable (tracks 1 through 4 and 7 and 8). The rest sound like a cat caught in a washing machine. Terrapin, Octopus and Golden Hair are good enough tunes to warrant the second star, but your life will be just fine if you never hear any of this album. Go buy Moby Grape or Love if you're desperate for psychadelia."
3,"Good Book, But May Be Overrated","Many people find this book THE book to read in regards to a deaf child's experience (of course, that includes her family as well). And this book is very good at showing you what a hearing family goes through when a deaf child is born into it. It tells of the ""typical"" struggle between raising their child strictly oral or letting them sign, too.Many doctors and therapists tell hearing parents that to allow their deaf child to sign would be to hinder their ability to speak, lipread, or progress intellectually. All of this is hogwash, but, nevertheless, that is what this book is about. What should we do with our child?If you're looking for that kind of informative read, this book is sure to please. For me, it was just another book about the same old issue and I found myself skimming often just to get to something original. As harsh as that may sound, that's just this deafie's opinion. :v)"
5,Heartwarming story,"This book provides a fantastic insight to the struggles of raising a Deaf child in the 1960's and 70's in a world where American Sign Language was not a popular choice and oralism was at its peak. It shows the struggles of the family raising a bright, Deaf toddler and trying to do everything they can to help her, and taking every path they can to assist their daughter. The story is a great read for anyone who has or knows a Deaf child, as it introduces multiple options for what to do to help them and the advantages and disadvantages of each. A beautiful story."
5,Great Read,"This book was required reading for my ASL class. I had heard from my classmates that it was an interesting book. As I found out for myself, it was wonderful. The lies that the ""mainstream"" told to the Spradleys is still evident today where kids are forced to speak, wear cochlear implants and hearing aids and deny their native language. Being able to tell your child that you love them and have them understand is paramount and by denying a deaf child their native language, they can't ""hear"" you say that you love them...they have to see it."
4,Great little axe,"nice durable ""little"" axe, this thing chops wood like a boss but the protector is not very good as its starting to fall apart already"
2,Just Okay,I purchased this camp axe with the intention of storing it in my go bag. I chose this one in particular due to the high reviews here on amazon but have been pretty disappointed with it. Within the first 10 seconds of opening the package I ripped the button off of the sheath which is made of a very cheap plastic-y material. The axe itself is a bit too heavy for my tastes as there is only minimal benefit of added weight with an axe of this size. I wish I would have gone with something a bit more robust and lighter like the Fiskars camp axe.
4,Just listened to a promo of the cd....,Simply said: This album is Apache Indian's finest to date. For those of us that though that he was a thing of the past wake up he is back and better than ever!!! This CD shows Apaches extreme reggae depth and talents... To me the standouts on the CD are tracks 6(I Pray) and 7(Shackle and Chains) The Boy George track is kinda hot too......
2,wanna hear it,i would like to listen to samples but there aren't any. can you set me up with some samples?
3,Excellent,"Excellent textbook for the student/foreign executive who is proficient in ""Business English"" and needs a smooth transition into ""Social English"", i.e., it takes a student's English language skills to a new level."
5,Marco A. Solis y Rocio lo logran nuevamente!,"La gran inspiración de Marco A. Solis se deja ver nuevamente en este disco de Rocío, seguido inmediatamente de su disco anterior Como Tu Mujer que fue un gran exito en Mexico, de aqui se desprenden los hits Te Amo, A Que Me Quedo Contigo y Si Te Pudiera Mentir (Mismos que Marco incluyo en su disco Trozos de Mi Alma). Definitivamente un gran Cd digno de estar en cualquier coleccion de musica."
3,Fotography,"I wish it had more pictures, and pictures of better places. Nicaragua is rich in culture. The parks are nice, the churches are also nice, etc. I belive that ULYSSES will do better next time. The book is great.R.G."
4,WHERES THE SOFT GRIP?!,"good pen for a tabletpc.im using it on my IBM X41tablet and it works great.i only wish it was a soft grip pen, the weight and thickness is fine but wheres the softgrip?!for a pen over $40 it should have a softgrip.also the eraser is a little scary erasing with on the tablet. i suggest using a screen protector. i got mines from Strong Engineering and i no longer fear sratching the screen.i dont really use the pressure sensitive aspects of the pen. but they do work. be sure to realign your tablet to this pen because it uses a conic(cone) tip instead of the lead-like-tips of other tablet pens."
4,Tablet Pen,"I've used this pen for aproximately one month and found it is very nice to use. Better than the pen supplied with the tablet PC. Only complaint is the button is easy to accidently press. Not a major issue, just sometimes annoying."
2,Would Like to edit change for FOUR stars,"Worked great for a week.Did what it is suppose to do, BUT then after one week, the tip came out and I can't find it.Luckily they did send a spare, but now I have to decide whether to glue the only tip I have into the pen...Cross does NOT offer replacment tips.// //////////////Update to review ....Watcom Technology sells the ""nibs"".Five in a pack for $10.I ordered last night and they are in the system (UPS) already.Would like to change my review to FOUR stars but am unable to do that.Sorry everyone..."
2,Stopped working after 1 1/2 years,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the feel of this pen is great -- it is heavier and wider than most other tablet pens. Unfortunately, my pen stopped working very suddenly after 1 1/2 years, so I can't recommend this product."
1,"Great tablet pen, but not compatible, so waste of time.","I'm sure this is a great tablet pen and really wish I could have found out firsthand. Unfortunately, it is not compatable with my Wacom Graphire tablet. Nowhere in the description did it state that the pen (made by Wacom) was not compatible with my Wacom tablet. Would have been nice to have a list of devices that it works with/doesn't work with. It's shown right there on the back of the package, so I'll make it easier for the next person:""This pen is compatable with the Wacom Cintiq.This pen is NOT compatable with other Wacom products: Intuos, Graphire, Volito or FAVO products.""Hope this helps!"
4,The Gates of Sleep,I reccomend this book because it is very different than any thing else I have ever read as well as thought provoking and allegorical.
5,A wonderful book by a wonderful author!,"Sarah lives in Puritan Massachusetts. When she breaks the strict rules by laughing and playing on the Sabbath, she faces a painful moral dillema. If she says nothing, an innocent person will be punished in her place. Yet if she admits it was her, her father might shun her forever. How will Sarah find the courage to do what is right?"
4,Santa Barbara phenom going global...,"I have had the pleasure of seeing Kirstin perform several times in the Santa Barbara area and a few things have struck me: her energy, her optimisim, her raw talent, and her ability to capture an audience. All of this shines through on this EP. I'm pretty sure the EP is just a ""Glimpse"" (get it?) to get people stoked for ""Another Sweet Mess,"" which is her next CD, and that's understandable--there aren't enough songs on this record to give you a full idea of how good kirstin is! If you're looking for a new artist and want to take a chance this is definitely a place to begin--you won't be disappointed. And of course, if you're ever in Santa Barbara and Kirstin is playing--go. You will never be let down."
5,Excellent sunglasses,"I moved to New Mexico from Connecticut and realized the huge difference in the intensity of the sunlight. My dainty sunglasses that were sufficient in CT just weren't cutting it anymore so I decided to invest in a polarized, more protective pair of sunglasses. I used to dread buying sunglasses because I have a smaller face than most people. I trusted a review that another customer left about these sunglasses being good for someone with a smaller face. They are perfect! They wrap around the sides more to block the sun in my peripheral vision and still let me see clearly in all directions. They are very comfortable and my eyes are very happy even on the brightest of sunny days."
4,From slapstick to comedy,"Indeed, why bother buying this release when 28 films by the late Harold Lloyd are just about to be released, complete with seal of approval by Suzanne Lloyd? Well, the antics of the somewhat dated duet Pollard/lloyd are certainly not up to standard with the tightly-scripted, gorgeously-photographed and carefully-preserved features New Line is about to provide us as part of their impressive 7-DVD set, yet this massive offering was obviously conceived as a tribute to the stellar aspect of the comedian career, and the crude beginnings of his bespectacled persona have been carefully ignored. This Kino release shows us how Lloyd evolved from the madness of his post-sennettian style to the more subtle touch of his first three- and four-reelers; as such, and while it is admitted that the box set is indeed indispensable, this is a slice of history, not tampered with, for better and for worse."
1,GREETINGS TO HAROLD LLOYD FANS,DO NOT BUY THIS ONE. THERE IS A HAROLD LLOYD BOXSET COMING NOV 15. IT`S CALLED THE HAROLD LLOYD COMEDY COLLECTION FROM NEW LINE HOME VIDEO. IT COMES WITH ALL OF LLOYD`S SILENT FEATURE FILMS AND 13 SHORTS THAT`S ALL I KNOW FOR NOW. IT SHOULD BE SHOWING ON AMAZON REAL SOON.
3,Average,"most things are very obvious, anyone could have written this book.would be good for kids, easy for them to understand."
4,Interesting read,The information on decoding your kitty's body langauge is quite interesting. But most of the information be known to seasoned cat owners. Will be a useful read for first time cat owners though. The pictures are great too.
3,leaves much to be desired,"This book is cute, fairly informative but leaves much to be desired. It would be a good gift for a kid who is getting a cat for the first time, but the parent will want a book with a lot more answers than this picture filled book offers."
4,Interesting read,The information on decoding your kitty's body language is quite useful but simple. Might be known facts to experienced cat owners already. Useful read for first time cat owners though. Great pictures.
3,Not especially pleased with this rack,It comes with NO instructions. Gibralter has no instructions on their website for assembly of this rack. They offer no direction on how to find assmbly instructions on their website. While my rack looks very good and is much more practical than stands everywhere it wasn't without headaches/hassles. Even with memory locks my clamps slipped unless I tightened the clamps so tight I dented the heck out of the rack. Now the rack has little dings all over it. I ended up using memory locks on each side of each clamp ---> expensive <--- Overall I'm not at all impressed with the company. Anyone selling a product like this that doesn't include well written instructions and preferably videoes on their website isn't doing business right in my opinion. I still don't know so much of my hardware slipped so bad... and this is on a VERY expensive Masterworks kit...
5,beyond comparison,"I've been JL fans for more than 15 years.When I first heard this, I was totally amazed with his superb control of his total sound designs.Philly soul provides us with the best performanceof JL ever.Sensible touch and cool funky vibration is the trade mark of JL.No other keyboardist can play better than JL.I mean his pop sensibility and his sweet melodies. Keep pushing JL.I've been waiting for your next album."
3,"Jeff, You Can Do Better Than This!","Jeff Lorber has been for me since the mid-70s a premier contemporary jazz artist. Even at his lowest points, he is still worth being a part of your collection. Unfortunately, on this latest outing, it appears poor Jeff may have had musician's block. Nothing grabs you. It pales in comparison to his last outing ""Kickin' It"" which was quite simply wonderful. This project, unfortunately, is mostly flat and rather disappointing. If you are not a Jeff Lorber fan, you will probably find this tedious - if you are a Lorber fan you will thoroughly understand that we can't hit the mark all the time. This only serves to whet my appetitie for his next project because quite frankly ""this ain't the one!"""
3,World Aging Issues,"I have used this book as a multicultural gerontology text with mixed reviews. It is an excellent review of world poverty, issues, and programs to address these needs. It does a good job of not romanticizing other world views, but looks at struggles realistically.This book is really a report of HelpAge International and it actually reads more like a document than a book - I think more could be done with stories and narratives and make this come really alive.The graphs are sometimes difficult to decipher, but overall the graphics are easy to understand and there are many exellent links for closer review."
3,LONG,"i have to say that it took almost 200 pages for me to get into this one and once i was in, there was no putting it down. the book is like non other i have ever read. i kept wondering what kind of a man thinks of such a twisted, warped, horrifying story. if you are currently seeking psychiatric assistance at this time, FALSE MEMORY may not be the best choice for you. if you are looking for a SCARY page turner, pick this one up!"
4,"Good plot, but redundant","In this book you have Martine, a computer game programmer, and Dusty, her construction business owning husband. Martine has a friend named Susan, who is an agoraphobic neurotic. Susan senses something is wrong. She is finding something ""sticky"" in her underwear and feels like she's been raped. It happens every night but she deadbolts all of her doors and there is no sign of forced entry.With Susan's death, Martine and Dusty are thrown into chase for life and death, truth and falsehoods. This book is very fast paced, even though the 3 days spans into 750 pages. But who are Martine and Dusty, really? Yes, we all know about Skeet, Dusty's druggie brother. But, unfortunately, you don't really get a ""feel"" for the characters, except for maybe the exception of the villan, the psychopathic psychiatrist.Good plot and good suspense, but weak character development and redundant wit from the main characters."
3,"Sorry, but I didn't really like it.","What I did like (a little) was the characters. To me the story was too much like a hollywood movie. Specifically the scenes with the two assasins in... New Mexico? And like mentioned in another post, too much time describing shadows and bushes."
2,I have already read this book about twice now!,"Mr Koontz needs to think of a new story. He has used thisbasic premise several times now and it is getting old. If he uses theword ""fugue"" in one more story I might never buy another book of his again. I knew what his characters were going to be doing pretty early on. Thought the whole reason why the doctor chose that family as about the stupidest reason ever. I enjoy dogs. I really do. How come though it seems in half of his books they are always the smartest? Also, why do they always have to be retrievers? Ok Mr Koontz, I get the idea, you like retrievers! What about a German Shepard, even a poodle? Maybe even another animal? I did like the Skeet character. It was about the only original thing in this story. For a really good book by Mr Koontz, see Strangers. It had many of the same elements with a better story line...END"
4,Enthralling book. . .up all night!,"This book kept me reading well past bedtime. I managed to finish it in 2 days, while neglecting a few of my life's minor details! Haven't done that in ages. Anyway, I found the book to be totally captivating, even if I was put off initially by the ever present golden retriever (sometimes a Labrador in Koontz's stories). The ending wasn't as satisfying as it could have been, but wasn't bad either. Definately worth the 627 pages. My only quibble. . .what happened to the President's nose?"
3,"Great start, poor ending","I very much enjoyed the first third of the book, but, ultimately, it left me unsatisfied.The ending in particular was lacking in creativity. It was simply too pat. I would have enjoyed the book more had it remained at the intellectual level, with much less physical action. If I want physical action, I'll watch ""Mannix.""The characters themselves are a little on the extreme side. The good guys are nothing but good, the villain is perfectly villainous. And, somehow, a lowly housewife video game designer demonstrates expertise in close combat small arms usage. How's that? A few too many conveniences. In the end, my disbelief was left unsuspended."
4,"Pretty Good, Not Great/False Memory","I loved the premise. A doctor placing subconcious suggestions in our characters heads. Ones that can ruin their lives and did ruin the life of one of their friends. It seems a hopeless battle against the all powerful doctor, but Every villian has to make a mistake somewhere and Martie along with her husband and their band of renegade vigalantes seem to have found a way to foil the evil doctor. Great idea, slow at times, but well worth reading."
3,"""Terrifying concept--a bit too wordy for my taste""","This was the second Koontz book I've read (the first being Intensity). The format was identical to Intensity. The only difference being, this book took its own sweet time in identifying the villian. This book truly drags. The villian in this book is the best you will ever come across. I found him more despicable than even Hannibal Lechter. The concept is utterly creepy. Just the thought of someone having the power to get into a mind and brain-wash it is terrifying. The character; Susan was very well played. Some of the others: Dusty, Martie, Skeet, etc., etc., seemed somewhat shallow. The final destruction of the villian needed to be more gruesome, to justify his inhumane mutilation of others. Koontz does have an absolutely amazing way with words. I just wish he would use a few less, and get to the point."
3,Interesting,"Before I begin, I would like to mention that this is my first Dean Koontz book to read. I was highly intrigued by the description on the book flaps, and in the beginning I couldn't put the book down. Towards the middle-end, things went much slower. I will have to agree with Ben on this one, the storyline had much potential, then in the end it was just a violent gun fight, nothing thrilling about that. I enjoy the book and will continue to read Koontz, but this will not be on the top of my list."
5,One of his best!!!,"I have been a reader of dean koontz's works for some time now and was at first hesitant to read this particular novel mostly due to the fact that I didn't think I would have time to finish it. When I finally began it I wasn't able to put it down. His ability to deeply define his characters while sucking you into the story is something that you can find in his novels such as Phantoms, Dark Rivers of the Heart, Watchers, and Lightning but False Memory is a new high for him. You have to find out what will happen to the characters because you begin to feel a connection with them. I STRONGLY recommend this book to ANYONE who enjoys fastpaced novels with twists, turns, and surprises."
4,It was a real thriller,"It is a real thriller. The writing is good, the characters are engaging, I'm really enjoying it.Dean Koontz is a great writer. He really cares about his readers.(wink).Not only is this an intriguing thriller (I'll admit I listened to the audio book - time isn't what it used to be) - but it contains, or suffices, as a review of the Manchurian Candidate that makes you want to read that book as well, and a good, fast-paced, entertaining story with - while not suprising in any way - a solid, happy ending.Gotta love them retrievers.So - wherevery you are, Dean Koontz -- ""I'm listening.""Mark Ehriman"
3,Very Very Slow for the Most Part............,"I struggled to get through most of this book. It was a great read however(If you like novels like the ""Tommyknockers""). The book is so enveloped in creating loveable and unforgettable characters, that Koontz uses an excessive amount of detailing. For instance, One, 15 minute scene in the book is a slow, 2 hour read. On the good side the plot is awesome! There are enough twists and turns to keep you guessing to the last page. If you are a reader who doesn't mind many pages of slow scenes to get to a spectacular story, you will love this book! However, if you are looking for a typical fast-paced Koontz novel, try ""Whispers"" or ""Intensity"". Don't make this book your first Koontz book. It's not his usual style. Try something with more of his original flair first. You'll just have yo wait and see...it's very subtle."
4,"Memorable, if you can trudge through it","I read almost all of Koontz's books. Most of them I have loved while reading them, but a few years later, I can't remember much other than ""they were suspenseful and good."" This book was the first Koontz book I almost quit reading. Sixty pages into it and I was still not hooked. I have patience while reading and waiting for a story to develop, but this one almost lost me... and then it finally pulled me in. Once it got going, I liked it a lot and it did become a typical Koontz page-turner for me. And the story was unique enough that is has stayed with me, even though it's been a few years since I read it. This is not something I'd recommend to people who are reading Koontz for the first time, though."
5,Koontz does it again!,"I have a little trouble with starting a Koontz book. Only because before bed or during lunch is usually the only time I have to read. I lose lots of sleep and feel the urge to ""peek"" at my book during work. This book did the same as most others of his work. It was a brilliant book from beginning to end. It grabs hold of you right off and keeps you with it."
1,How many times can he write the same book!,"The continued success of Koontz both saddens and amazes me. It certainly shows that the average American reads somewhere below the ninth grade level, and/or has some serious short-term memory problems. I started this book and soon realized it was way too similar to two other Koontz works I had picked up (one I read, the other I brought back to the library after ten pages). How many times can this guy write about paranormal/esp type experiences involving criminal behavior, and have the public eat it up time and again? Obviously ad infinitem! Sad, very sad."
1,Ugh! Continued.,"In my previous post I expressed the hope that I could finish this book, and that it would be worth the effort. I finally did finish it, as it picked up some a third of the way through. Though the pace became faster, the ease with which the protagonists figured out the evil doctor's brainwashing techniques and the unrealistic, cardboard cutout characters toward the end ultimately provided a very unsatisfying read. I found Koontz's use of popular real life entities (Keanu and Amazon.Com) to advance the plot off-putting. Any suspense generated was dulled by too obvious red herrings planted earlier in the story (the kevlar vests, for example). Try again, Dean. You struck out with this one."
2,I've Been Here Before...,"Am I the only person who recognizes the evil doctor as the essentially the same villian as in DRAGON TEARS? In DRAGON TEARS , he is a young, demented hermit, who has an obession with eyeballs (which he keeps in jars of formaldehyde in his secluded mansion), has killed family members, may be a genius (and a sociopath), has a thing for junk food and wears black silk pajamas. Sound familiar? When I heard that Dr. Aramin's wears black silk PJ's, I said, ""Oh come on..."" Koontz recycled a formula here and has lowered his skills to mass-production. I wish he would find his imagination again."
2,Great Story - but Long - Long - Long...,"A fabulous story and plot ruined by the minutiae of seemingly endless nonsensical dialogue. I could not wait to get to the last tape of this audiobook, but almost gave up many times in frustration. What could have been a gloriously diabolical intrigue has been spoiled by sheer boredom."
2,Too disturbing,"I love horror stories, and have read the reviews others have already written about this book. I was looking for someone who shared my main problem with this book, but it seems I am alone so far. At first I thought I was going to love this book - fast paced and all as others have said (though I agree that there is way too much description of Marty running through the house afraid). The thing that is making me stop reading this book though is that one of the story lines deals with incest in a way that is so profoundly disturbing to me as a woman that I can't continue to read the book. It just makes me question Mr. Koonz's motivation in writing this. He is a little TOO good at imagining this fantasy,and it is so painful to read about the woman's reactions -- and so pornographic at times -- that I just found the whole thing pretty disgusting. A warning to woman readers that this book might be too misogynistic to enjoy."
1,I Feel Stupider for Having Read this Book,"The title says it all, but I'll add a few lines. The premise of the book is very good, which was why I picked it up. Unfortunately, I did not know that I was entering the perfect world of the 4.0 GPA house painter and his video game programmer wife. While the plot is very believable, every bit of verbage around it was ridiculous and overdone. Might be good for a cheap romance novel, but certainly not the ""Psychological Thriller"" the cover claims it to be. Much, much (!!!) too slow paced to be that. By the way, this is the first review I've ever written here. Usually I'd say to each his own, but I fear that others in this case may lose intelligence as I did if they read this book, so I just thought I'd warn you before you do it!"
2,Lame,"This was my first Koontz book, and perhaps my last. The idea of the story was interesting--mind manipulation. However, the author didn't MAKE it very interesting. I'm surprised I even finished it. Not much else to say...it wasn't very memorable. Perhaps someday I'll try reading The Watchers. For now, I'm going back to Stephen King."
3,Not His Best,"Having read all of Dean Koontz's books, this one fell below my level of expectation. The opening of the book was like riding a roller coaster that never stopped. The description of Martie's growing fear could have been told more succintly. There was too much useless description. The story could have been told better without it. The ending, which I am sure was supposed to have been a surprise or twist ending, came out of nowhere. There had been mention of Dusty's family throughout the story, but those descriptions did not prepare the reader for what was to come. So the ending felt like it came from another story. I am a fan of Dean Koontz, but this book was very disappointing."
1,Dean's Hyperbole,"""Along the whetstone of clear eastern sky, the sun sharpened scalpels of light."" Not only hyperbolic, but a mixed metaphor as well. (Would you want your surgeon to sharpen a scalpel on a whetstone?) Dean has gone all-out in this one with a 2000-word description of a dog poo, ending with a warm plastic bag in the dog owner's hand. (This I read while eating breakfast)."
3,"First 2/3 of book was riveting, then it went downhill","For the first 2/3 of the book I'd give it 5 stars. The whole idea of mind control is fascinating and the characters of Martie and Dusty are particularly well-drawn. Because they're so normal, their descent into the psychological hell that has been created feels all the more scary. I couldn't wait to turn each page. As I got nearer to the end I felt cheated. The wrap-up was implausible and the tie-in with Dusty's mother and the incidents at their house seemed silly. Even the final scenes with the Doctor could have been done with more finesse."
4,A Very Good Book.....Scary as in it could happen to you!,"I enjoyed this book very much. It is the first book by this authour that I have read and the first book I ever rated. Might have something to do with the book itself I suppose... ha,ha,..Then why a 4 start rating you might ask....that is because I did find myself wanting to skip through some parts of the book where the storyline was getting good but there was all these unnecessary explainations thrown in to slow me down. Other than that I give it an excellent rating and reccommend it to anyone who is looking for a good read."
4,Nothing like I expected but still excellent,"When I bought this book I expected it to be something entirely different than what it was but it still turned out to be better (and less cornier) than I thought it would be. When I saw how long it was I thought it would take me forever to finish it but by page 3 I was hooked and finished in four days. The pace is fast but not so fast that it lacks plot or character development. The doctor was just a little redundant, though, and seems like the perfect mix of two previous Dean Koontz characters (the doc with the steel hand in ""The Key to Midnight"" and Bryan Drackman in ""Dragon Tears"")but was definitely not a boring or typical villain. It's a great read and I'd write more about it but some guy who looks like Billy Crystal just told me to jump off a roof."
5,False Memory,"I found this book to be highly entertaining. Dean Koontz creates such interesting characters and I think that is what makes me enjoy his books so much. Sieze the Night and Fear Nothing were my favorite, but I thought this book was just as good."
4,A Troubling Psychological Thriller,One of the more absorbing psychological thrillers I've read in a while. Koontz is the master at fast pace storytelling and this book is no exception. The descriptive passages about the various phobias troubling the story's characters left my palms sweating and pulse racing. The only downside was the introduction of the character that resulted in the villian's ultimate downfall. It seemed this character was added as a convenient vehicle to bring the book to a close.
2,Just not as good.....,"I love Koontz - have read every single book he has written, started with Phantoms (scared the pants off me). False Memory just isn't one of his better books. I can't put my finger on it, but it seemed to me that Koontz was trying to do something outside of his pattern. This one just missed the mark. I'd rather go back and read Lightning, Intensity, Watchers, Phantoms, or Whispers than recommend False Memory to a new reader of Koontz."
4,excitement at its best!,"Although a bit drawn out in some places for DK, this book was wonderfully exciting and a bit scary. Things even tie up at the end. Kept me turning pages until I was done.Great Read!"
1,Waste of Time,"This is a very long book and it is equally slow in developing characters that are interesting. As the story unfolds you quickly learn the dark aspects of the Dr. Ahriman. He is one of the most disgusting and vile characters in a book I have ever read. SPOILER ALERT this character is raping women, planting ideas in childrens head that there parents were molesting them, and getting off with this power that he has. This book was a complete waste of time and I wish I have never started it."
2,False Memory,"Perhaps I shouldn't be writing this review, as I have not yet finished ""False Memory."" I can however, comment on the writing style. Koontz wastes lots of words describing everyday events in very purple prose. His writing is self-conscious and overuses similes and alliteration. What the author really needs for this book is a good high school English teacher to remind him how to state things descriptively but succintly and Reader's Digest to help him abridge his book.This is my first experience with a Koontz book and I will probably never read another. The story line is intriguing, which keeps me going. Perhaps the poor writing style will be forgiven once the story has come to an end."
4,What I liked and what I didn't...,"This book has a great plot and good, likeable characters that we care about (a true Dean Koontz specialty). However, the author does tend to ramble with the psychobabble (and there is a lot of it). This book would have been FANTASTIC if it was about 100 pages shorter. I found myself skimming in places. All that aside, I would like to thank Mr. Koontz (and that other guy, Stephen King)for maturing with their loyal readers and realizing we need a change - it is possible to scare (and entertain) without having to heap on the slobbering monsters. I will continue to buy his books as soon as they hit the shelf."
1,Totally Disappointing Koontz,"Did any one else notice, that with a few changes, this book could have been ""Strangers""? The plot is hackneyed and hacked together. Always have been a strong fan of Koontz, I have almost everything he has written under all of his names. What has happened to his books lately? Story line, from the first chapter, was predictable, and aggravatingly wordy. Have not finished, but can not put it down, in the same way you worry at a sore tooth.All in all, I am just plain disappointed."
2,Waste of time and money,"This book took way too long to develop into an interesting turn pager. The first 300 pages were very difficult to digest, and I found myself having to read the book in 10 page intervals before I really became interested in the story and the plot itself. After getting to the heart of the plot, the story became a bit clearer and more accessible.I really do not like Koontz's writing style at all. The word usage and metaphors just come across as pretentious. The length of this novel could be cut by well over 100 pages if Koontz would quit the intellectual posturing, and just stick with basic story telling.For all I know, a majority of the positive reviews for this book come from Koontz himself, under 59 different e-mail addresses."
1,No Way Koontz Wrote This One,"Let me just make a list of negatives, then positives:-Misleading intro. The cover and/or inside jacket of the book says that ""False Memory"" is about authophobia (fear of oneself), which is BS because it's NOT.-The villian is revealed too early on, so the suspense is gone before the book is halfway through (unlike in his Midnight, where readers don't know too much too soon)-Too much phycological description.-Disgusting description of the death of little girl, which belongs in a police file about child molestation, really.-One dimensional bad guy-The killing off of characters that had great potential in the story.-Dean Koontz ""no espeekee Spanish."" He keeps misspelling a young girl's Spanish name.-A saccharine fairy tale ending that I could not believe.The positives:+It could happen in real life+The characters felt real very likable+I'm glad I purchased the book second hand for only $1"
2,Big letdown...,"This was my first Koontz book, and it may be my last. Not even half way through the book you find out ""who done it"", and the rest of the book is everyone trying to catch the guy. I probably read the last half in about an hour, just flipping through the pages and finding nothing interesting. I'll stick with Vince Flynn, whose books keep you guessing all the way to the end."
2,"Tiresome, Tiresome, Tiresome","I've enjoyed Koontz's books for years, usually finishing them rapidly and recommending them to friends. Yet I could hardly get through False Memory because of its uninspired plot, overloaded scenes, tiresome detail (excessive and pointless in the extreme.) For example, does Koontz HAVE to LIST brand names,prices, adjectives, constantly? - ""...Gunsmoke Dodge City playset by Marx for only $3,250, and a die-cast Johnny Lightning Custom Ferrari for only $115."" Maybe he's being paid by the word? Do you think? Bottomline for me: I was very irritated by the whole thing. Very disappointing, especially as I've liked so much of his previous work."
2,Too similar.,"I'm afraid False Memory did not meet my expectation of a sizzling read. Although the character development was typical Dean Koontz quality, I found the story line boggy. Intensity kept the reader's nerve endings tingling which was simply not the case in False Memory. I this reader's opinion...False Memory is not one of Mr. Koontz""s best work."
3,OVERALL GOOD READ-FALSE MEMORY,"""I did enjoy this book. The unique and superior intellect of Mr. Koontz again shows itself here."
4,Intense reading pace.,"This has to be one of the best by Koontz. It's an excellent book which took off like a rocket from the first chapter. I actually read the new Crichton book ""Timeline"" before this and found this to be quite a bit more exciting. Buy and enjoy. I'm not auctioning mine off, it's going in the library."
3,Too Wordy!,"This was my first Koontz book and I was very disappointed. Although I thought the story was okay, I felt Koontz droned forever - off on some tangent that had nothing to add to the tale. It was the first book that I have ever ""skimmed"" and felt I missed nothing. It would have been better at 100 pages lighter"
2,Not My Favorite.,"I've got to say, this book fell short for me. I really enjoy Dean Koontz but this book just DRRAAGGGEEEDDD on FOREVER! I was completely enthralled by the description. I really thought I'd like it but I found it dry, boring and too long."
2,Tired of Koontz,"Sadly, I think I am over Dean Koontz. I just finished this 784 page book and will admit that I skipped over large chunks of it in order to avoid his overuse of descriptors and similes. Also, he seems to be more and more infatuated with grotesque sexual/abusive themes.I was very intrigued with Koontz after reading his excellent 'Lightning' 16 years ago. It remains one of my favorite books. I ended up reading many of his books written about the same time as Lightning and enjoyed those as well.At 700+ pages, this book takes a long time to get to Koontz' usual happy ending. I felt like the conclusion to the mystery/problem was presented in a rushed, contrived manner.It pains me to admit that my last few outings with Mr. Koontz' writing have left me dissatisfied and turned off. Perhaps he is going through a different creative stage and will one day find his stride again.I hope so."
1,Another re-encarnation of a geat story,"He has done it again, taken a good story and made it less appealing. This whole ""fear of open spaces phobia"" was in another horror book and it was even made into a movie with Sigourney Weaver and Harry Connick JR., in this False Memory, Koontz has taken the concept to deeper levels, but it is really not that appealing in the sense that he tries too hard to make you feel the fear of his protaganist, it is not realistic, nor exciting enough to be fantasy. I recall this once before in ""Fear Nothing"", he used the idea from another great book, ""Between the Shadows of the Night"", which was much more compeling than Fear Nothing and much more imaginitive. Dean Koontz is a great writer, but he needs to be more original with his new titles."
2,700+ pages of reader suffering,"This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself. It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature. So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second."
3,"Recycling helps the environment, but....","not when we're discussing novels. While False Memory is an enjoyable read, I enjoyed Night Chills much more. If you compare the two, you'll find so many similarities that False Memory could be termed a rewrite, as Winter Moon is a rewrite of Invasion. Nonetheless, Koontz is a gifted storyteller and you could do much worse than to spend a few enjoyable hours with this novel."
5,THE BEST YET FROM KOONTZ,"While I am an unabashed fan of Dean Koontz's work, I have always felt that his greatest strength as a storyteller lies in his ability to construct a compelling plot. However, I have also felt that his characters remain a bit underdeveloped, inhibiting my ability to care about them. (This is, conversely, Stephen King's greatest strength). However, in FALSE MEMORY, it all comes together and this book is without a doubt Koontz's best work ever. In Dr. Mark Ahriman, Koontz has created a villian who rivals Hannibal Lecter in his capacity for pure evil. If you're a Koontz fan, you will LOVE this book. And if you're not, give it a read anyway. You cannot help but be spellbound by it."
2,false memory,I'm a big fan of Mr. Koontz but I'm sorry to say this is not a good book. It's kind of predictable and long winded-like a Stephen King. But being a Koontz and a King fan I'll keep on buying them.
2,Too long and wordy,"Dean Koontz is a good writer, even though he is too wordy for the type of book/genre. This story could easily fit into 200-250 pages and the rest of the almost 700 pages is strictly filler material. This seems to be the course for most of today's name brand writers."
5,Uncanny Description Pulls Hard,"As a person who suffers from panic disorder that is controlled by wonderful medication, I can attest that this book is so perceptive in its description of phobias that it through me in a full out panic attack. I recovered, of course, and am finishing the book now.This is my first Dean Koontz book and I am hooked by his stunning writing and captivating characters."
3,300 pages too long,"Koontz is fine in this twisted tale of brainwashing and phobias, but the story becomes diluted in the second half of the book and loses its focus by the time page 600 rolls around. Koontz has been on a roll lately: Dark Rivers of the Heart, Intensity, and the two Christopher Snow novels are the best he's done. I put this one slightly ahead of Sole Survivor, but below the aforementioned four. Wait for this one in paperback. Koontz will be publishing a non-Snow novel ""From the Corner of His Eye"" next year, with the final Snow novel ""RIDE THE STORM"", to follow in 2001-2002. Can't wait."
2,Plodding and disjointed,"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan on books on tape. I've listened to the unabridged editions of almost everything he's done -- and he is the best. I could not get through the second side of the first tape. It dragged. It plodded. Sometime when I run out of books on tape I'll finish this one, but compared to Dragon Tears, Shadow Fires, and the like, I became afraid I'd be pulled over for sleeping while driving."
2,F. Scott Fitzgerald He Ain't,"As a long-time Dean Koontz fan, I slugged it out. As always, the premise of his novel was great. What I found most objectionable however, was Koontz's endless and annoying literary devices. Koontz is a great storyteller. He is neither Hemingway nor Fitzgerald and should stick to what he does best - telling the tale. This book is as full of similes as there are drops of water in the ocean, if not more. Hopefully, Koontz will stick to the story and stop trying to dazzle us with these tedious, ponderous and cumbersome forays into the literary realm."
2,plot drags...,"This book is extremely long for the message it is trying to convey. If koontz had taken the liberty to miss out a few hundred pages i think it would have given the book the successful status he was looking for. characters are interesting and well appointed , but there is alot of meaningless story line that could have best been forgotten. Save your money."
1,Muddled metaphors,"I find it hard to believe that Dean Koontz actually wrote this book. Maybe he has cloned himself. WATCHERS was interesting, as well as a couple of others, but FALSE MEMORY is what I hope will soon be my false memory. Agonizing, tedious descriptions, similies and metaphors on every page, a ridiculous plot. Granted, Koontz is, at best, a time filler, but at least 350 pages could have been cut. Koontz' edge is that he writes about the area I live in, so that's usually a good hook. But this writing is so banal and sophmoric, I doubt whether I'll ever pick up a Dean Koontz story, no matter how bored I am."
3,Could Have Been Better,"A young woman has a job she loves and a fabulous life, until things take a drastic turn for the worse. She suddenly develops an overpowering fear of her own shadow (yes, her shadow), and there's something in her mirror she also finds very disturbing. A good read for this genre, but more polished dialogue would have really helped this story."
2,Anti-Intellectual Diatribe,"At his best, Dean Koontz is one of the best suspense writers of all time. Unfortunately, however, his writing is often a vehicle for a philosophy of neo-anarchist romanticism and anti-intellectualism. This book, which deals with the implausible concept of mind control through deep programming, is basically an anti-intellectual diatribe. Intellectuals and government are seen as the source of all the problems in the world, and we are told that action guided by moral purpose is all that is needed. We are supposed to learn how to live from the superior wisdom of dogs. Koontz's prescription for living would seem to be something like this: Love a dog, get a gun, take care of your own, drop out of the political process and don't think too much. Yeah, right!"
2,I expected so much more....,"I have read one other Dean Koontz book, From the Corner of His Eye, and it was much better, although still long. This book, Falso Memory, was also too long winded- also, everything was revealed before halfway through the book. I kept reading because I ""just knew"" Koontz would have something up his sleeve. But he didn't, for the most part. A few surprises, but not 750 pages worth. He still hasn't touched Valerie WIlson Wesley's ""When Death Comes Stealing."" Way better read.Everyone is so obsessed with Koontz- sure his vocabulary is floral, but that's where it stops- either he loses me, I can't feel the characters, or both. I may read ONE more to see if I can jump on the bandwagon, if not, I'll be on the expressway."
1,A boring Koontz suspense,"I have read all Dean R Koontz books, I am always looking for new books from this author, I started to read False Memory at least 10 times and never got my interest, finally I ""read"" it in one day skipping most parts, sorry Dean I did not like this book at all, excepting Skeet, the characters were completely unappealing."
2,A Good Sleep Aid,"I gave it two stars because it helped me get to sleep,sorry Mr. Koontz.I enjoyed the moonlight bay stuff though but,zzzzzzz...."
3,Took me a year to finish it!,"I have read a Koontz book in less than a day but this book took a year to finish. It was far less interesting then the many other books, I have read by koontz. There was one great concept in this book I loved and it has little to do with the story line. It is obvious that I am not the Author or I would have given it 5 stars! Its a good book that I do recommend!"
3,false memory,"koontz's books are usually excellent,however this one was a bit of a letdown.This was partly because he took the discriptions of the scenery e.t.c a bit too far,and the book became tedious reading at times.this is unlike any of his other books that I have read,I couldnt put them down!.false memory seems to me to be of a different genre alltogether from his usual spine chillers."
4,All Dean Koontz fans must read this!,"For all the people that know and love Koontz this book is a must read. I have every last book written by Koontz, with the exception of his new one(already in the mail!) And enjoy everyone of them. This book is very well written and has plenty of plots twist to keep you interested. It also plays on a common fear of not having control over your own life. I honestly stayed awake until 4 in the morning reading this book because I honestly could not put it down. I hope you buy this book and enjoy it as much as I did!"
3,Hm....close but no cigar,"I won't deny it, this book is a fast read and quite entertaining. I finished it in less than a week, which is quite good for me. To quote the book, ""The plot was entertaining, the characters were colorful..."" However, certain aspects were too outlandish for me to believe. Maybe I didn't suspend my disbelief enough, but having Dusty and Martie as these heroes who deflect the Evil Dr. Ahriman and therefore save humanity was too contrived and far fetched. (What was the deal with the doctor and the preserved eyeballs??) However, Koontz did a pretty good job in concocting this whole crazy plot. He could have really done something with it. It was close, but no cigar."
3,Not particularly memorable,"I read every Dean Koontz book hot off the press and am usuallyhooked from the first few pages. This one is not typical Koontz inthat I was over 200 pages in before I became interested in the storyline. The protagonist is weird and dangerous, without a doubt, but in the end, he is simply a man, and I missed the supernatural/paranormal elements which are quintessentially Koontz. If I read correctly, the evil doctor's chief motive was revenge for bad literary reviews of his work on Amazon.com! The main characters -- Martie, Dusty, Valet, Skeet, et al. -- are well and highly developed and, once you get past the slow start, you will certainly gain sympathy, worry about them, and root for them to the end. The premise is brainwashing, keyed by an individualized haiku. As depicted, it's probably possible, which is genuinely frightening. END"
4,Good as usual,"Good, as usual, for Koontz. Along with Charles Wilson, he ranks as my favorite writer, and that's double-good reading with them both coming out with books the same month this year, Koontz's ""False Memory"" and Wilson's ""Game Plan."" Try either and you're in for a good read. The only problem is now I probably have to wait for a full year to get a new book from either of them now."
4,good book,"Although the beginning of this book was slow, I really enjoyed it. It was a little wordy, perhaps, but quite worth the read. I enjoy the way Dean Koontz uses such horror and kindness together. Goodness always triumps in the end. Imagine being married to such a wonderful storyteller."
3,What a Roller Coaster ride,"This book is a roller coaster ride from the beginning, a very intense roller coaster.I found it to be a bit too intense and a wee bit far fetched. The story line kept me rising, falling and turning in every directions with an unbelievable ending."
3,Try Another Koontz Book,"Please don't think that this is the best writing Dean Koontz does. I have been a fan of his for years and his other books, especially Watchers and Lightning are better page turners than this. Just the excerpt shown here shows a different Koontz than I remember. He seems to be out for the grade from the old high School English teacher who constantly harps on metaphors. I caught myself trying to picture all of these mental scenes, losing sight of the real reading. I am not a fan of the INTENSITY of this type of writing. I am not sure who will take his place in my heart and my bedside table ...but his older ones are better. HEAR THIS, Deano, go back to the old ways of the force.Give his other books a chance...you won't be as disappointed in them."
1,Most disappointing book I've read by Dean Koontz,"As much as I like most of Dean Koontz's writing, I found this to be very bad. I read almost half the book and found myself half sick about the story line and I was very bored. Story did not capture my interest at all, and in some ways it repulsed me. Thankfully, I bought it used so I didn't pay so much."
5,Nothing false about False Memory,"This is a classic example of a Dean Koontz novel. One of his best in my opinion. I don't mind the supernatural element to the stories that he usually adds, but this book is so fearsome because of it's realism. We are vulnerable to many things and this just demonstrates this. I will not spoil the novel by saying anymore than this. If you enjoy suspense, Dean Koontz' style of writing, being scared out of your wits and really getting into a book you can't put down, then this novel is definitely for you."
4,PGF...Pretty Good Fiction,"Excellent plot...truly evil villain...likeable characters. At times, a bit too much time is spent unnesessarily describing things in poetic prose. I would caution would-be-readers that a few of the scenes are difficult to get through. Due to the depravity of the villain in this story, some scenes will be highly offensive. I myself wanted to throw the book out the window while reading one part in particular, but didn't because I wanted to see justice for the characters. All in all, this is pretty good fiction...a thriller that keeps the pages turning."
2,False expectations,"This book had plenty of suspense which kept me turning the pages.The trouble was that the high pitch of tension lagged when the author obviously ran out of steam. It's too bad, because a shorter more tightly written piece would have been really good."
4,"Good, but certainly not his best.","I have been a long time fan of Mr. Koontz's since reading Whispers while pregnat with my now 15 year old. Most of his books get you with in the first couple of pages, except this one. The plot was entertaining, the characters colorful and I enjoyed it. :) But it was very slow at the beginning. Had this book been by any other author I would have put it down after the first 10 (short) chapters. Valet was great, but certainly not his best dog yet, as noted on the dust jacket. The evil Doctor was a great charactor, but Skeet could have used more depth. While I did enjoy the book, its not one that I will re-read several times."
2,Not to my taste,"After spending much time trying to pull all the plots and characters together, I have given up on this book. I find it too disjointed and hard to follow. I try to find books to excape the problems of the world and entertain me. This one missed the mark for me."
4,False Memory,"I have loved Dean Koontz novel's since I picked one up 15 years ago. This one is yet another that just keeps me wanting more. He is a spectacular author that puts thing into description that can actually make me sit on the edge of my seat and frighten me more then an actual horror film. I have read and seen his book which was made into a movie ""Hideaway"" Of course the book was better, but it's because of his writing technique. Keep up writing those best seller's. I highly recommend to anyone that has never read a book by Dean Koontz does. You'll be hooked"
1,Watch out! Your IQ will decrease by reading this!,"An earlier reviewer gave this 5 stars and gushed, ""You will not stop reading this until you are finished!"" Another 5-star bestower said, ""This was so suspenseful that you do not know what is going to happen next!"" Need I say more about Koontz fans? The next time you want to pick up something by this guy, reconsider and give the really talented and original writers out there a chance instead. If you are one of the reviewers I'm picking on, I'm so, so sorry. On so many levels."
2,Very Let Down,"I was very disappointed with this book. I have read most of Mr. Koontz's books and I was shocked how poorly this was written. I found myself scanning the pages waiting for useless, boring, cutsie dialogue to end between characters. So much time was spent trying to develop a base for the plot, there was no time for real story content. I feel most of the book could have been edited out. At the end I was very let down. I would not recommend False Memories to anyone."
2,Ugh!,"Being a long-time Dean Koontz fan I was very disappointed with the plodding pace of this book. I've always prided myself on never starting a book I didn't finish--regardless of how bad it was. This may be my first. After reading a third of the book (and forcing myself to do even that, skip-reading and skimming much of the time) it has caught dust on my coffeetable for two weeks. Koontz has always been a very poetic writer, using lots of words to convey simple scenes. In the past this never bothered me. This time it did. As always, his golden retriever character is great--much more interesting than the humans.I hope I can pick this book up and finish it. I also hope it is worth the effort."
2,If you can wait long enough . . .,"the book will get interesting. The interminable description of Martie's autophobia indeed is rather boring, but once the story finally gets started, the read is almost worth it. The plot is predictable, and the villain isn't very intriguing. However, if you have spent the money on the book, by all means finish because it gets better as it goes along. And, Koontz writes well."
1,Letdown,"The plot was great, but it was ruined by Mr koontz habit of useing flowery prose to describe every little thing in the story from the palm leaves to rugs on the floors. I almost didnt bother to finish the book after the first four chapters my mind was so numb. the book gets much better at about the halfway mark when he stops useing filler because he cant seem to write anything really pertinent to the story. I was very let down by this book , I payed for a novel and wound up with a short storie.The book is 751 pages long and about 300 of the pages is filled with mind numbing descriptions."
3,A Rhetorical Feast,"False Memory is the first novel by Dean Koontz that I have read. The story doesn't pick up until after the first 200 pages. The author had some obvious fun with literary concepts. His descriptions of places and people were liberally sprinkled with metaphors,similes,and metonomies. The Japanese poetry form of haiku plays a central part in the drama. While all of the literary going-ons were interesting, the novel has a flat and unbelievable ending. The main protagonists deserved a more realistic denounment. Still, it was a good read. I couldn't put it down until I finished it."
2,Not Memorable,"I had not been able to finish the author's previous two bestsellers but did finish this one. I wish I had not wasted my time with so many well-written novels waiting to be picked up. Its about time the reading population realizes that the bestseller list literally means nothing as far as good literature is concerned. ""False Memory"" starts off with a bang and ends with a fizzle. Unfortunately, about half way through the novel the plot becomes unbelievable and the characters likewise. I quickly lost interest in who was controlling whose mind and for what purpose. Koonz should have done more research on the subject as all of a sudden all the characters became masters at mind control. In a nutshell, this novel is too long, too ridiculous and too verbous to recommend as good reading."
2,Koontz USED to be my favorite author,"but good god, how many times can he write the same freakin' story?? I put this book down for like two months after the first couple of chapters, because I knew what was going to happen. Finally, I decided to pick it back up, but only because I hate leaving a book unfinished. I trudged through it, but it has to be one of his worst books to date. Why can't he get back to some original thinking like in The Bad Place or Lightning??"
2,He should have warned us,"I love Dean Koontz' work. I own and have read almost everything he has written; but as a victim of brutal childhood sexual abuse, and being currently under the care of a psychiatrist to deal with issues related to that abuse, and having not been believed by my parents, I never made it through this one. It was a brilliant story, and he portrayed the horror and shame of sexual abuse from the victim's point of view masterfully, but it was more than I, and I dare say most people who have actually experienced abuse, could handle. Next time, please, warn us when there will be rape and/or other sexual abuse (that may re-open old wounds we aren't quite ready to deal with yet) graphically and repeatedly used in a story line. I'm looking forward to his NEXT book."
1,Literally threw the book in the trash halfway through,I had heard that Dean Koontz was a great author so I decided to try him out. The back of this book was so intriguing I couldn't wait to read it. I wasn't drawn in at all in the first hundred pages and by page 250 I actually threw the book in the trash. I cannot believe anyone would like this?!
2,A Soap Opera,"This bloated novel starts off slowly. Then it becomes quite interesting and promising. Unfortunately, it looks like the author didn't have a plan how to develop and end this story: by the end it was so dumb, it wasn't even funny. Koontz wasn't even trying to keep it believable. I gave it 2 starts for the effort, otherwise it's a solid 1 star."
5,A MASTER STORYTELLER,"Sociologically speaking, Dean Koontz writes many basic truths about society, and a journey into the mind can be read about in False Memory. I think that Dean Koontz's works are extraordinary and will be the classics of tomorrow."
3,GOOD KOONTZ BUT NOT HIS BEST,"I read this book in three days and found the whole saga to be riveting, bright and fresh but all the way through I couldnt help feeling that certain parts dragged on. His descriptions can be at time infruriating as they red herring you from the plot; at times I just had to skip them to get on with it. Not bad but read intensity,dark rivers of the heart, cold fire & the bad place to experience this usually fascinating writer on 'better' form."
1,A haiku for Mr. Koontz,"book lacks focus, lifereads as though quickly writtenhair weave too tight DeanI should have known when I was able to buy _False Memory_ in a thrift store for $1. How did this best seller hit the skids so quickly?The copy I had was obviously rushed to press. The text had words hypenated as line endings but appearing in the middle of the sentence, which was distracting to the extreme. (It's like try-ing to fig-ure out what the in-tent was. Hurts reading that, doesn't it?)Picture this: A publisher's heart-to-heart with his best-selling author. ""Dean, they're just not buying the surfer lingo of your cooler-than-frost genetic reject Chris Snow. Can't you produce some of that psychic chill you're famous for?"" Factor in a late night with a double feature of _The Matrix_ and _The Manchurian Candidate_, some dodgy sushi, and you've got _False Memory_.Hey Dean, better luck next time with the sushi. For all our sakes."
5,Best Book ever!!!!!,"I have been a Koontz fan for a long time and read several of his books. This book is by far my favorite of his and of all time!!!!! It has been several years since I read it last, but I can still remember the jaw-dropping suspense of the climax of the story like it was yesterday!!!!!! If you are looking for a totally mind-blowing experience, this is the book for you!!!!"
4,solid koontz,"WHile maybe not up there with his very best, this is Koontz in all his glory, twists, and turns, with believable, likable characters and extraordinary circumstances that test the limits of the human will. A recommended read."
4,Manchurian Memories,"Anyone familiar with The Manchurian Candidate has a leg-up on this book, from the start. It's not giving anything away to say so, because the book itself makes it pretty apparent early on.This is essentially the much better version of Koontz's earlier Night Chills. A number of people in a given area begin displaying bizarre, atypical, destructive behavior. Of course, they all have something in common. That something is what the hero of the piece has to discover - and put an end to.A very involving read, though it has a shaky beginning. Koontz's characters, especially his psychopathic villain, are typically well-drawn. There are some nice comic touches, throughout.This is one of Koontz's few good books of the last several years. Nothing new, really, but at least he's back in the saddle with this one, and not exploring quasi-scientific metaphysics. False Memory is just a good, straightforward Koontz thriller."
5,"Didn't like it? Yes u did, Dr Ahriman instructed you not to","This is a sensational book by Koontz and extremely believable. What Dr Ahriman does with drugs and mind control is obviously something you hope will never happen but there are a lot of people out there with his outlook on life and on women who would do exactly the same thing if they could. This is what makes this book sensational, terrifying, believable and addictive. I couldn't put this one down."
4,The Fastest 700 Pages You Will Ever Read,"When I bought this 700 page book, my intention was to have something to read during my lunch break for the next couple of weeks. What I didn't expect was to breeze through everything within six days. Koontz grabbed me by the collar after the first couple of pages and refused to let go. The villian in this story is Koontz' most diabolical creation yet. There were several times when I just wanted to reach into the pages and pummel the guy to oblivion. That's a mark of a ""good"" character. Nevertheless, I was annoyed by a few things. The dialog between the two lead characters was at times cutesy and annoying and the ending seemed rushed. I've noticed from past books, that Koontz tends to paraphrase the fates of his characters in just a few pages rather than fleshing them out. [...]Regardless, this book has reawakened my admiration for Dean Koontz novels and I can't wait to start the next one."
2,too long with annoying distractions,"This book was way too long and Koontz's tedious metaphors and many descriptives were too distracting. However, I did like the good-hearted Martie, Dusty, Skeet and Valet characters, and the villian was satsifyingly evil and often hilarious as well. Also unlike some other readers I don't mind knowing who the villian is sooner rather than later, because it keeps you rooting for the good guys to catch him. But this book was filled with too many unnecessary details and descriptions. And towards the end, inexplicably one of the nutty patients suddenly seems to get rational enough to hire a lawyer to get her out of the trouble she got in due to a mental illness which she previously seemed to have no control over. What was the deal with that?"
2,Cruel and predictable,"I have been a fan of Koontz for a long time. Most of his books I find engaging, entertaining, and (of course) somewhat frightening. This book was only cruel. There was little suspense and too little reward. I'm glad I got it at the library and could just check it back in."
1,The koontz library in a blender,"I'm a big Koontz fan so I was looking forward to ""Fear nothing."" So it was with some disappontment that I finished the last page. There is nothing particularily wrong with this novel, it's just we've read it before. The mind-washing of ""Survivors"", the evil doctor (more sadistic it is true)from at least 2 books, the shadowy organisation (though it is never truely realised here and so on. It feels as through Mr. Koontz threw his past plot index cards up in the air and caught a few at random. This is a great starter book for new Koontz readers, but for fans disappointment awaits. Fingers crossed for the next book."
1,Boring!!!!!,"This book did not capture me at all. I tried, but I never evenfinished reading this book!!!"
2,Too slow to get going,"I've read just about all of Dean Koontz novels, and I'd have to say this ranks as one of his most, if not the most, disappointing. Like some of the other reviewers, I just found this way too long. He spent an excessive number of pages setting up his story. It was page 400 out of 600 before things really started moving. The first 200 pages I kept waiting for something to happen other than redundant setups and plot threads that eventually come together. While it becomes a real page-turner in the last 200 pages, for the first 200 it was a page skimmer. If this had been a 400-page novel, it would have been a four- or five-star thriller."
2,So Slow....,"This is the first Dean Koontz book I have read and I have a feeling it will be my last. I only picked up the book after my Mother and Sister ranted and raved about it forever, so you can imagine my disappointment when the book dragged on and on. The first half of the book was pretty good, but it went downhill after that. It took me about five weeks to finish this book because I found myself wanting to do so many other things besides pick it up and try again. I eventually forced myself to pick it back up and skimmed the rest of the book. I was extremely disappointed in Dean Koontz and his writing capabilities. I find it hard to believe so many people would love him if this was his best effort, therefore I realize it cannot be. Perhaps I should give another book of his a chance before I write him off for good - but there are so many other writers I enjoy that he just might not get another chance. I wouldn't pay the hardback price, but I guess it's worth the paperback."
5,GOOD TO THE LAST DROP!,"Dean Koontz is such a gifted and skilled individual when it comes to writing. I have read all of his novels and practially loved every one of them. He is a very unique author that combines Stephen King and John Sandford together. I believe that ""False Memory"" was one of his best novels. I like it a lot that Dean Koontz is starting to get away from the supernatural books that he used to write and is writing more mystery and believable type books. There is nothing supernatural in ""False Memory."" It is about a crazy doctor who wants to turn all of his patients crazy and puts them into a deep sleep in their sessions and hypnotizes them to do evil things, even kill people. Marty, the main character, must try and stop this deranged doctor before Marty's best friend is turned crazy. Dean Koontz will always be one of my favorite authors and I am greatly awaiting his new thriller, ""FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE"" on DECEMBER 26, 2000!"
1,POOR REVIEW TURNS AUTHOR INTO PSYCHO KILLER,"A HUGE fan of Dean Koontz (think I've read them all), this book was a HUGE disappointment. Still reeling from Chris Snow and his adventures which left me panting for more, reading this book was an out and out chore. Seemingly written in a weekend with weak characters and an even weaker plot, the only thing I found gratifying was the motive for the psycho killer to target Marty in the first place . . . a poor review written about the killer's book on (get this) Amazon.com. C'mon Dean . . . were you just wiped out?"
2,A disappointment.,"This book disappointed me. I am a die-hard Koontz fan, but this book actually bored me. It was hard to sympathize with the characters, the plot was thin, and the book lacked the magic usually present in a Koontz novel. The dog had potential as one of those magical Koontz animals, but even he turned out to be a real nothing in the book. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on this one."
2,Cookie Cutter,"The characters are all cookie-cutter characters from his previous novels, up to and including the adorably intelligent golden retriever. The first third of the book is excellent, and his peek inside the heads of neurotic people are spooky. Then in the next third we meet the obligatory megalomaniac-genius-evil-doctor and the rest of the book might as well have been any other of his 'let's get paranoid' thrillers. The last third is highly improbable-action-adventure, however it redeems itself when we meet the wonderfully bizarre family of the male lead. These characters deserve a book of their own. But the plot is interesting and I think the first third of the story makes it worth reading."
4,a very good read,"I enjoyed this book alot, but wondered if anyone else noticed all the hyphenated words that are not usually hyphenated. I started noticing them about midway through the book,and started writing them down thinking that there might be some sort of message. As with all of DK`s books, this one is very wordy and you will need adictionary close by."
1,Demented,"I find it disturbing that an individual could consciously write something like this. It is both sick and tactless. If this is the way Dean Koontz is going to write from now on, I'm finished with him. I value the sacredness of life and of the mind, both of which Koontz shamelessly exploits in this novel. And the way he seems to write disparagingly of women in this novel (most of the victims in this book are women) angers me greatly."
2,"Way too much descriptive, repetitive writing",I have read most of DK's books and this one was almost painful. Things really don't start moving until half way through. I forced myself to continue and did a lot of skimming when it came to the wordy descriptions and detailed repetative drama in the beginning. Rather disappointing.
3,False treatment of false memories?,"I was interested in others' reviews of Koontz's False Memory because the ones who suggested keeping on reading it until 220 or 300 did keep me reading until 300, but then I quit. I liked the characters Dusty and Skeet, but I found the descriptions of Martie's problems to be unbelievable and boring. And then the distasteful treatment of the psychiatrist's abuse of Susan was really overboard.Here's hoping the next Koontz I read is better."
2,Worst Book of Koontz I've read,"I have read alot of Koontz, and all have been excellent, until this one. It was slow, it dragged. I had trouble finishing it. I did though, thinking it would get better, it didn't.The dog really annoyed me in this one. I was waiting for him to show some spunk, but he remained a wimp all the way through.I'm not sure what happened here, but this is one Koontz, I would skip if I were you."
2,false memory,I have tried to pick up this book 3 times now and just can't seem to get into it. Does it start out slow. I keep hearing how good it is put I just haven't gotten to the point to where I don't want to put the book down. Like most of his other novels. Give me some input please!
5,The fifth star is for keeping me up at night,"I can't remember when a story has so thoroughly gotten under my skin. I'm the one who loved the horror movies (so laughable)and telling ghost stories but they never ""hungover"" the way this story did.I found the book in a half price bookstore over Christmas. I almost didn't buy it, I've been let down by recent stories by Koontz (not the Moonlight bay set). But everything in the store was 20% off half price... Can't go wrong with that.This book took me 3 nights to read, after work. I couldn't put it down, but always reached a point where I had to... I was getting goosebumps & hearing noises & jumping at shadows.This story captivated me. It is the best by Koontz in a long time."
3,False Memory by Dean Koontz,"This man has a wonderful imagination. Mr. K., you have made me positively lust for a Golden just like Valet! This is no mean feat, since I have four cats. This being said, I have to carp a little. Please, no more space filling similies! This device is annoying, detracts from great story lines, and just seems like showing off all your considerable knowledge. I loved the people and cared about their fates. I also appreciate the amount of research that went into this book. My only complaint is the amount of unnessary filler. Less is more!"
2,Good First Half..,"False MemoryAfter the first 250-300 pages I couldnt go on. I even went farther then I wanted to.It should have ended about here,instead it went on to things I cared nothing about and I couldnt figure out what could possibly happen that I didnt already know......And it drives me nuts not finishing a book."
1,Too much horror for me,"A friend of mine had this audio book, and she did not have time to listen to it so she lent it to me. I tried, really I did, to get through this book. However, I finally stopped and sent it back to my friend. It was awful. The author takes too long to get into the main plot of the book for one. He also describes the worst kind of psycological horror and cruelty, and great detail of rape. I could not take it. This was not entertainment to me. I do not recommend that anyone read this book. Save your money for an artfully done suspense thriller book."
4,Clear your Schedule,"Marty, Dusty, Valet the dog, and family awake one day to see the world from new eyes, a new perspective. Only the love they share for one another will keep them grounded as mysteries unfold and the truth about those they trusted is exposed. Forced into unreal situations with no where to turn and no one to trust they set out to save thier own lives and the lives of many who may never know the danger. The enemy within and without proves to be a viable foe as they press through.Koontz lends good twists and a fairly intersting plot. Full of prose and poetry the good and bad guys in this novel teach us a lesson about power and love. The love story makes it worth the read. Not for those who seek climactic showdowns."
2,Predictable,This was not one of Duncan's best. The ending wasn't good at all. Most of the book was too predictable. Duncan has many great books and this isn't one of them. Anyone deciding if they should read this book should read something else by Duncan. Read something like Down A Dark Hall. That was a good book.
4,An outstanding suspense!,"Killing Mr. Griffin was an outstanding book! The characters, settings, and the plot was very percise and detailed. What most intriqued me was the interesting suspense that kept me on the egde off my seat! I like the book and would definitly recommend it to a mystery lover."
5,Killing Mr. Griffin,Frustrated students at a high school in New Mexico kidnap a teacher named Brian Griffin just to scare him. But he died while the teens left him the mountain until he begged to set him free. Then they panicked and then they tried to. The main character Mr. Griffin died and that is how he was changed. Yes I would because the book has a lot of suspense and the story line is great. I would give the book a 5 in the rating process. This was a good book that all young teens should enjoy.
3,Pretty Great!!!,"I had to read ""Killing Mr. Griffin"" for my 8th grade English class and I loved it!! I could not put it down! I thought the book should have ended a different way then that but all in all it was pretty great! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good suspenseful book to read!"
4,Krista's review,"This book was cartainly very interesting, and I would recomend it to anyone. It is full of suspence with a exciting twisted ending. Even though the teacher in question was pretty mean and strict, and I could identify with their dislike, it was very sad to me what happens. The author uses flash backs in this book very well, always giving the right information at the right time. Lois Duncan also is incredibly good at developing his characters. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that the students deal with the problem in a very bad way, which only escalates their predicament. Anyway, I could not put the book down and I would recomend it to both readers for pleasure and for teachers to use in class."
2,Dumb - not one of Duncan's best,"I had a hard time believing that Mr. Griffin's students would go so far as to kidnap him, even if they meant it as a joke. Yes, the idea was that of Mark, a psychopath (the book even describes him as such), but even so, he did not strike me as being anywhere near charismatic enough to persuade any of his classmates to kidnap a teacher.Susan was clearly meant to be the novel's heroine, but quite frankly, I wanted to smack her. She was supposed to be smart; why couldn't she see that the Popular Crowd's sudden acceptance of her was entirely self-serving? Why did she allow herself to be used as a decoy in Mr. Griffin's kidnapping?Lois Duncan's strength has always been in creating believable characters in even the most outlandish circumstances..but in this novel, she fails to do so."
4,Killing Mr.Griffin,"Killing Mr. Griffin is an awesome book. It is filled with tons of mystery and secrets. In this book, Mr. Griffin is a strict high school English teacher who pushes his students too hard. Five of his students thought it would be fun to pull a prank on him. But when their prank fails, they find him dead on the ground up in the mountains in a place where nobody knows about."
1,What's So Funny?,"I found this book not morally complex or sophisticated so much as just plain offensive and cruel. I don't see the point of taking us inside the minds of teens who would even consider such a brutal crime as kidnapping and terrorizing another human being. This has none of the layers and provocative questions of ""Lord of the Flies."" It was, to me, pointless. Most teens I know are interested in cleaner fare, in deep questions about life on other subjects. And despite the predominance of disturbing themes and plots in teen novels, many teens I know look for other books instead; they really aren't that interested in stories of kidnap, rape, incest, suicide, and murder."
1,this book is stupid,this book was the worst book i ever read if you have to read this yu should jump out a window
2,Killing Mr. Griffin,"Killing Mr. Griffin was not the best book I was ever forced to read. It was kinda confusing because they would jump personalities to different peoples thoughts. This was also hard to read because it drug on FOREVER. I like to be forced to read scary books that jump right to the chase on the crime that certain person was committing. BUT, don't NOT read this book because of what I said because no ones the same, and you might like it, all I'm saying is that I didn't like the book Killing Mr. Griffin."
4,Danny's review,"I was reading Killing Mr.Griffen by Lois Duncan. It is a great book I really liked this book because of all the action. I think I'm really going to like this author.This book is about how this English teacher is a really hard teacher and the kids in his class don't like him. So these five kids [David, Mark, Jeff, Betsyand Susan], want to scare him. So they tie him up and take him to a place nobody knows about. When they leave him there and comeback, and he's dead.I think a reader who would like this is a reader who likes mystery and action. He would like this because it has a lot of mystery and action. So if you want to find out if anyone finds out about Mr.Griffen? or where they put the body? Read this book!"
3,Killing Mr. Griffin,The story is about a group of students witch takes place in school in an english class. There teacher in that calls is call Mr. Griffin he is the meanest and hardest teacher in the school he takes no late papers and no slack work.The main charecter of the book is makr he decieds to make up a plane to kill Mr. Griffin but in order to do that he needs help so he askes a cupple of his friends that he hangs out with to help him with his plane. It takes him some time to convince his friends into doing it but say lets not kill him but to scare him into thinking of killing him. it ends up in a big mess they end up attaing Mr Griffin in a cabin but the thing about it was he ended up dead and no one knows who did it??I thought Killing Mr. Griffin is a very well writtin suspense novel. I thought the book was ok in my point of viewbecause it took kinda long for me to get into it but when i did it was good. i would recomend this book to people that like to read suspense and mystery novels.
4,Killing Mr. Griffin,Killing Mr. Griffin by Lois Duncan was a good story. It made me think about how people are. David took care of his grandmother everyday and seemed like he was a nice guy. Yet he still had another side to him. This side was mean and wanted to do something bad to his teacher. I think all the other kids should not do something wrong just because a cool or popular kid says that you should. I recommend this book to read.
4,Fabulouse book!,"I thought Killing Mr. Griffin was one of the best books by Louis Duncan. Her other books are good too, but you can not put down this one, not even for a second. I really loved the twist and turns in every chapter. Also I really enjoyed the ending as well. I think in some part of the book it's very much like the book and the movie ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"". Especially the part that they wanted to hide the body and not tell anyone what had happened. I really felt bad for Mrs. Griffin because now she had to take care of the baby all by herself. I defiantly recommend this book to all teenagers even if they don't like to read a lot of books."
3,"Good, But not for everyone!","I know a lot of people that read this book really found itamazing. I only did on the middle part, when the kidnapping begins. Irecommend this book for people that read regularely. But, like me, a rare reader (i actually had to read it for class) i kind of got bored. The story is a really good idea, but if you want a book that you can get the stroy right when you open the book, then Killing Mr. Griffin is not for you. It has a lot of details, personnally, a bit ""too much"" details. Anyway, the book and story was good, as Lois Duncan is too!"
3,mr. griffin boring,"Not a very exciting or suspenseful book, kind of dated use of the words ""foxy"" ""far-out"""
2,I can see why other people would like this book,"This book wasn't incredibly interesting to me. I could definately see why other people would like it, but I just didn't. The characters were just too much alike to be interesting, the language was too low for the reading level, and the plot was farely unrealistic. I mean who gets away with murder like that? Especially in a small town! The police should've tested for fingerprints right away, and Mrs. Griffin should've gone to the police when she suspected Mark, Sue, Dave, Jeff, and Betsy."
2,My opinion!,"If you want my opinion, the novel is not very interesting. There are five students, who want to take revenge on their English teacher, by scaring out of his wits, because he openly humiliates them. They actually kill him, because they don't know, that he needs those pills to survive, which one of them destroy. The novel can also said to be unrealistic, because the reason for kidnapping are not very plausible. No one kidnaps a teacher, or any other person, because of their being unfair. If we hadn't read it in our English class, I wouldn't have read it. In fact, I would have given it away after the first twenty pages."
3,killing mr. griffin,"Killing Mr. Griffin by Lois Duncan is an interesting murder suspence novel. Lois Duncan has written several other books including Gallows Hill, Dauters of Eve, A Gift Of Magic, and I Know What You Did Last Summer, which inspired the motion picture. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat and guessing. I found it frustrating that you're never exactly sure who you should be rooting for. It is an entertaining story, but I think there should have been a little better closure at the end. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy suspense and a different kind of murder story."
2,Nearly Perfect,"As a big fan of lois duncans amazing work, i must say that this is a unique horror thriller. it is about a students that dreadfully hate their teacher Mr. Griffin. the reason for this is because almost every student in that particular class gets atleast a D or below. So...by the title of this, do YOU thuink Mr. Griffin will survive?"
3,"Ending is hard to understand, but the rest is well writtten","Susan Mconnell is far from being voted most popular in her school, but one day she bumps into the most popular boy in her class and the next thing she knows hes asking her on a date. Mark, David, Jeff and Betsey are convinced that this teacher, Mr. Griffen, Is the meanest cold hearted man they have ever met.This date was setup by mark, Jeff, David and Betsy so that susan would agree to distract the hardest, yet best, teacher in shcool while Mark and Jeff creep up behide him and kidnap him to a spot that only one other person knows about. Susan soon relises how mark has gone mad, but will she save Mr. Griffen's and her own life in time, read KILLING MR. GRIFFIN to find out. This book is very interesting to see what each character will do next. I recomend it to ages 12 and above."
4,Killing Mr Griffin,I think That the book was Sort of interesting. The best part of the book was when Mr Griffin Got kidnaped by the kids. He had a heart problem.
4,Interesting,"We found this book okay to read, it was interesting enough to read and report on but it could have been better. The parts we liked were when Mr Griffin died and when susan was tired up. Betsy was our fave character."
2,a very boring book,Killing mr Griffin by Lois Duncan was kind of boring but it was kind of a good book in a way because it was a mystery sort of book. In some parts of the book it gave things away. In a way the book was sort of confusing because the chapters ended with one thing and started with another.
3,boring Books,I thought Killing Mr Griffin was boring after reading a few chapters.It started good but then it became a bit hard to believe that this would really happen to any teenage students.The best part of the whole book was Susans poem for the final song of Ophelia.The poem is only meaningful if you have read or seen Hamlet.the end was very far-fetched and had nothing to do with the story
3,Far Fetched,I thought killing Mr Griffin was a really far fetched book. It would have been better if it was set to something that might actually happen to teenage school kids. The part in the book though that I did like was the poem that susan wrote for the final song of Ophelia. It would help you to understand the poem if you read Hamlet first. I thought the poem was really meaningful.
2,Disappointing,"I had to read this book for school, and I thought it would be good from the synopsis. I didn't like it at all. It was too long, and the characters didn't seem as if they could be real kids, more like psychos. If you like dumb, predictable violence then this is for you."
4,Killing Mr. Griffin,"Five teenagers decide to kidnnap their English teacher. They bring him to the mountains, and leave him there. But something unexpected happened. Sometimes people cannot guess at the consequences of their actions. I recommended this book to any young adult from the age of 12-16 who like mysteries."
3,Dissapointed in Killing Mr. Griffin,"Compared to the rest of Lois Duncan's thrillers, this book shouldn't make it on the chart. Though I love all of her books, this one is my least favorite because of some of the unanswered questions left in my head when the book ended."
3,This is the fourth year I have taught Killing Mr Griffin,"This is the fourth year I have taught Killing Mr Griffin my English classroom. Why do I keep coming back to it? Well, it deals with controversial issues such as peer group pressure, popularity, revenge and responsibility. Also, it inspires some thoughtful discussions about the impact teachers have on our lives. (Surprisingly, most students acknowledge that while there will be personality conflicts with teachers, there are better solutions out there than killing them.) The novel contains some interesting intertextual references to Hamlet and actually encouraged some girls to rent the Mel Gibson video. There are some drawbacks to studying the novel. In many ways the book is preachy and message-driven. I also found the character of Mark to be a stereotypical 'baddie'. All in all, it is a well-written book that requires the students to confront their strongly held beliefs and attitudes towards learning."
3,Not one of Duncan's best,The book was okay but not one of Duncan's best. It was kind of slow. The ending was good and I think the plot was good too but I think the plot was wasted on such a bad story. I don't mean anything offensively to Lois Duncan and I really enjoyed all of your other books!
2,"A strange book, with a strange twist","This book is about a group of teenagers, who plan to scare their crabby English teacher. They kidnap him, tie him up and leave him in the woods, when they get back, HE'S DEAD, well now what are they going to do, you'll have to read it and find out."
5,"An exciting, fast paced mystery that has unbelievable ending","I loved KILLING MR. GRIFFIN. This book was suspenful and kept me on the edge of my seat until I finished it. Lois Duncan is an incredible author that can write things that teenagers understand well. I've read a lot of her books, and I believe that this is one of her best."
3,How can it be sanitary?,"It is sturdy enough for sure, but not set up to be sanitary. All the surfaces are fabric. How do you clean THAT in the wilds? I wouldn't want to have to share it, though we did.The hole into which you do you business is not that generously sized. Probably works fine for medium to small people who have a really good aim! Ha ha."
5,Awesome!,"This product is just awesome. I am 310lbs and this is sturdy, strong, and comfortable. Definitely a must have for camping, especially if you bring women. They will love it!"
4,Sit On It,Construction is solid. Likely to provide years of use and abuse. Arrived in a timely manner. Great!
5,Great improvement to any camping trip,"My husband and I camp in the Alaskan bush. The folding commode vastly improved our enjoyment camping (we used it without the plastic bags). It is sturdy and strong to sit on, and well made. It folds up to a size smaller than a folding camping chair. It has small pockets to hold toilet paper which is handy. If you camp without bathrooms, this product will really be helpful."
5,i love camping now!!!!,"I have just recently started to camp. My boyfriend loves to go rustic camping but i really hated the out houses. This is the best thing ever made!!!We recently went for 5 nights camping, some nights extremely cold and a few raining all night so it was wonderful to not have to go out of the tent. I was sick of going off the bumper of the truck :):):) LOL.Wonderful is all i can say!!!!"
3,A boy searching for his wisdom,"It is not the big karate of the year, but it has very nice karate moves. Its the story of a boy trying to build his confidence, by searching the power within the ring, which a karate master gave to him. If you are looking for a high tech movie, this is not the one you are looking for."
4,The tale of 2 rings,"This is one of my favorite TJ Roberts films by far and I'll start with the things I like being the choreography. TJ really delivers when he puts one the rings of power on. William Zabka plays the bad guy ( something he does well) you might know him from movies like the karate kid or just one of the guys. Well he possess the other ring which he stole in attempts to gain the one that was given unto TJ's character. The rings of power increases what is already inside of a person but to have them both is to make a person nearly invincible. ""The best explaination for all things is time"" a quote you'll learn as the story develops. I'm grading this according to quality of acting and delivering for a martial arts movie. Its worth getting if you like martial arts movies that the family can watch together."
2,Diplomacy,I think this book will be more helpful to understand real diplomacy but is just how British diplomacy has to be.
5,Kyocera Cell Phone Charger,It works as well as the original charger and is less than half the price. Getting this one over the one sold by Verizon is probably a good idea.
1,Missing Parts,The wire kit I was shipped was missing half of the harness and he connectors. Went to an auto parts store and bought the same one and it was fine. Had to send this one back. Amazon made it easy with ups pick up and quick credit.
5,Works like a charm.,"Well made and performs as it should. Plenty of wire. I am always concerned about these types of items as Chinese wiring is usually evident if you look at the wire head-on to see if the conductor is centered in the insulation. Like pencils now..the lead is almost always off-center in the wood. This, however, seems to be well-made."
4,Live the Dream,"""Live the Dream"" is a well balanced production of M. Lee Davis. The song, written by Davis and singer Karen Shayne offers luscious textures of vocal and choral arrangements, by Jan Smith and Alan Baker respectively, and sung by the heart rending voices of both Shayne and the ""Survivors Choir"". Singing for cancer victims and survivors, Karen Shayne and the Survivors Choir shine brightly. Well done!"
5,Remarkable and Poignant,"I am using this book in a social work class that I teach at Michigan State University. City of One is beautifully written, with well-chosen words demonstrating a thoughtful approach to sharing her story and insights. Dr. Cournos' personal reflections are both thought-provoking and somewhat jarring. As a foster care survivor myself, I am taken back to my own journey of pain, loss and triumph. The careful reader will find the book both dramatic and riveting as well as filled with life-lessons for personal use or for foster care reform. There are more than a few foster care memoirs on the market that are worth reading, but I recommend City of One if you chose only to read one book in this genre.Dr. John Seita"
4,Fun,I really liked this movie. Yes it's silly but it makes you laugh. Not bad at all. Good for a date night. LL Cool J is a player abd Gabrielle Union plays her part to the t. A good rom com.
2,Dull regurgitation of a familiar story makes this unnecessary...,"Shakespeare has been used over and over for many films over the decades. `Deliver Us from Eva' is yet another one and while it isn't good it isn't bad and so I have to kind of label it, well, unnecessary. I love Gabrielle Union, so I'll watch her in anything, but it's a shame that things like this get made without any real style. Substance can, at times, be substituted if there is some spunk, some sharpness involved, but this film is just kind of bland. The charisma of the leads (LL Cool J exudes it) isn't enough to make this anything more than just another of a long line of others."
4,Deliver Us from Eva,Loved the movie! I have nothing else to say about it. I really liked the movies. Why so many words? One would be sufficient.
3,Not bad!,I love both of the main characters in the movie but it was just a basic movie with a simple story line.
3,Annoying characters,This is an imperfect-but-creditable movie. It would have been better without the gay guy and the nymphomaniac talking about their fantasties. Eva's narcissism and controlling behavior were annoying. I was glad that her new boyfriend Ray was able to mellow her out. Unfortunately for the three scheming guys their plan did not work out.
2,yuck,"i really wanted to like this movie, but it turned out to be exactly what i expected: shallow, predictable & poorly written. they got a few chuckles out of me, but the overall movie wasn't funny or even entertaining. gabrielle union is obviously very talented, and she deserves a much better script."
5,Eva's Just like me!,"Eva's in people's business because she has no business of her own. I am the same way, however in my defense, a lot of people come to me for advice before I get into their business. This movie is good for a couple reasons, first my girl Gabby Union comes through representing like she always does in her little roles, but on top of that it shows the unity of sisters. I love that probably because i dont' have any sisters and I always missed that. But it was nice to see that love between the 4. My disappointment was at the end and when LL Cool J's body wasn't comin thru like it should on the little simi nude scene. What the hell was the gut about? disappointment. The end just was silly. How can everyone accept that they made it like he died. Who would just be cool with a fake funeral and all that? Someone would get murdered if it was me, but i guess that's just me. try the movie out though"
5,"Bravo,Bravo","I don't know what took me so long to see this movie. Now that I did. I'm sorry I have waited so long . Finally a movie that portays black characters in a positve and brillant light. Great leading actor LL cool J who plays a reformed player who falls for the smart, beautiful and controlling Eva played by Gabrelle Union who's just terrific. Supporting characters were great as well. The husbands were hilarious. This is a must keep in your DVD library."
4,Friday night fun,"This is such a cute,fun romantic comedy. I recommend it to anyone who will ever be spending a Friday night at home. Goes great with popcorn and even better with friends."
4,I took for what it was supposed to be which is a fun movie,"Deliver Us from Eva isn't a perfect film and it's not supposed to be. The film is a romantic comedy not just a urban film. LL Cool J and Gaberille Union have very good chemisty togetehr and carry the film. Essence Attkins, Megan Good and Robinee Lee all dyme pieces also do acting jobs and the men in their lives played by Mel Jackson and Duane Martin make the film enjoyable also. If you just want a fresh fun movie then check this out since the film does have a lot of heart and anyone can enjoy it."
3,It was o.k.,The movie was not as good as everyone proclaimed it to be. The story had a decent plot but it's not worth buying. Go to blockboster and rent it.
4,THE GOOD LIFE,THE GOOD LIFE TAKES YOU BACK TO THE DAYS OF ELLA FITZGERALD AND BILLY HOLIDAY. THE SOLOIST HAS A RICH DEEP SOUND THAT IS UNIQUE AND STRONG.
3,Better than most ski games,"I used to race stand ups and X2 model skis.This is overall a good game. Not the best game but by far, not the worst. Not the ""feel"" of the real thing, but good enough to allow ""non riders"" to have fun playing.I would have liked to have real tracks and skis but I guess the IJSBA, Lake Havasu, other locations, Kawasaki, and Yamaha didn't want to license out."
4,Great Action Game!,"This game is fun but it's really hard to win sometimes, and it's too easy to crash."
1,Three times not a charm...,"KOY and POW are splendid. This however......I mean, people will like it...if they like constant solarize effect and spinning 3d logos....I rate NAQ 5 bloqs of cheese."
2,80% Cheese,"The music is great. But 80% of the images are STOCK photos that you would pull from some video library--run through filters as though they had just discovered them. From the discussion on the DVD, apparently they meant it to be that way, but it comes across as cheesy cliché imagery. Their excuse is that it requires the viewer to 'work' more...translation = it lacks the universal quality that differentiates 'good' from 'GREAT!'"
2,Slightly dissapointed..,well to be honest I expected better.. did not live up to the standards of the original two 'qatsi' films.. the effort put in was great.. but this film could have been far more dramatic than it was.. the juxtapositioning could have been improved.. the theme was nice but you keep getting the feeling that there isnt one at all.. some visual effects were nice.. others 'cheap looking'.. alot of images/shots were draggedddddd.. even though most of them were great.. the film has that 'amateur film' feel.. primarily because of the constant usage of effects and video filters.. philip glass and his music get five stars though.. i wouldnt see this one again.. go see 'Baracka' if you need to see a masterpiece..
2,Crash Test Dummies,"Is it an accident that a crash test dummy is the cover art for this installment? It's always tough to meet such intensely built-up expectations following amazing innovation in imagery and music, but this was especially disappointing.Hey, what's Godfrey done lately??"
2,There is something better out there,"This ain't ""Fantasia""I like--to some degree--the music of Philip Glass. (But apparently I don't like 89 minutes of it at once.)I like--to some degree--the flash of images--even the flash of discordant image--and the thoughts these images provoke.But, mostly through it, I was rooting for Mickey Mouse to appear and hungering for the triumphance of ""greatest"" classical hits.This won't be viewed again; ""Fantasia"" will."
1,"so very, very bad","If you were to give a 15 year old 1 week on a 3 year old computer he could certainly create a more poignant statement about the perils of our species' addiction to technology. The only reason you could possibly give this movie more than one star is that you saw Reggio's first two movies in the series, rushed out to buy this one (I nearly did myself, thank g*d I rented) and are now somehow trying to rationalize buying the single most trite and boring piece of cinematography ever burned onto DVD. One reviewer called it a ""culmination of the trilogy"". Sure, in the sense that it is the culmination of all the left over footage from the last two movies. Trust me, there was a good reason he left the footage out in the first place. I was really looking forward to this movie too. What a shame."
1,"very, very disappointing... and bad","The first film in this trilogy, Koyaanisqatsi, is a classic.The second, Powaqatsi, is not as good but still worth watching.Naqoyaqaatsi, to quote some other reviewers, is just 'a mishmash of computer-treated footage, signifying nothing'... 'all quite forgettable'... except that the feeling of disillusionment and disappointment is hard to forget... The absence of Ron Fricke and his incredible cinematography that mad the other films so great stops this from even being interesting.Don't waste your time."
2,Mayhem,"Mayhem, missiles, madness and bombs in high contrast black and white or supersaturated, highly tinted colour. A dark and unpleasant collage of images, not particularly imaginative, that almost left me with a headache. Occasionally visually striking, so 2 stars rather than one. But overall - disappointing."
3,I liked the first two better.,"I got real excited for this one and had my hopes up for something amazing. Its ok, and my friends gave it a less rating then I did. I do appreciate what they are trying to do with this film even though I have no idea what they are trying to do in this film:) A good conversation piece though like the rest of the series."
1,I stepped in this one. Man it stunk.,"Really I did. This film was lying on the ground of a horse stable and I stepped in it. Then I picked it up with an inside out plastic baggie, brought it inside and popped it into my DVD player.This was so bad I kept pressing the display button on my DVD remote to see how much time was left. This film has no meaning. Don't be fooled by the director telling you it has a meaning. He's lying through his fake teeth. Seeing an 90 minutes of CGI number patterns, inverted images of nature and images of people eating McDonalds hamburgers is not a statement. It's a waste of the viewer's precious time. This movie is a piece of trash. I loved Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi but this was horrendous. I'm so happy I only rented it.I swear I rolled on the floor laughing when they were showing those wax statues. I almost bust a gut when I saw Abraham Lincoln.THIS MOVIE GETS ONE STAR FOR MAKING ME LAUGH SO MUCH."
3,Beautiful parts but unsatisfying whole,"There is no question that this film, like others in the trilogy, includes powerful and beautiful imagery. These images and pieces are amazingly well-crafted. Throughout the film there are wonderful images unfortunately interpersed with a number of too-familiar pieces of stock footage. (Do we really need another series of mushroom cloud images?)As much as I admire Philip Glass & Yo-yo Ma, I found the music far less interesting than in the other installments of this trilogy.I agree with those that assert that the main weakness of the film is that lack of a coherent flow or structure. The message is clear from the beginning and doesn't develop or unfold. I confess I watched the DVD in three sittings because I couldn't maintain attention long enough to get through it."
2,A disappointing end to a great trilogy,"For anyone looking for a fitting conclusion to the trilogy that began with the exciting Koyaanisqaatsi and then continued with the gorgeous Powaqatsi, this film is a bit of a disappointment. Instead of the beautiful cinematography of the first two films, this film relies on animation and special visual effects. If there is a single purely ""in camera"" shot, I didn't see it. It is very tiresome to see scenes so distorted by visual trickery that they are entirely disassociated from the real world. The Phillip Glass music sounds like someone trying to sound like Phillip Glass. The jumbled and distorted images eventually grow monotonous and it felt like a very long film for being only 90 minutes.The best thing about the DVD is the interview with Glass and Reggio who you rarely get to hear speak about the trilogy. I highly recommend the first two films, but the third one is best watched while doing the dishes or folding your laundry."
2,Botched Opportunity,"First, let me say, I LOVE Koyaanisqatsi, the original film in this trilogy. Koyaanisqatsi is a true visual poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are doing to the earth.The second film in the trilogy, Powaqqatsi, wasn't as good as the first but it was still fairly understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another.Naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war. Instead, it comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation, nothing more. If not for Philip Glass' music, I would not have given this film any rating at all.I write this criticism in hopes that Godfrey Reggio sees it. He should pull this travesty off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage showing us, as clearly as he did with ""Koy"", why war (the topic of ""Naq"") is so horrific. If you want an effective critique of violence, try ""Clockwork Orange"". Naqoyqatsi is simply a mess."
3,Miramax says this is how the picture should look,"As others have noticed, this picture is not anamorphic - with many or most scenes stretched horizontally. The Miramax technician I talked to said that this was how the producer wanted the film transferred (!) and that they were not planning any changes to the release.I don't know if this is really the case but you should be aware if you buy this DVD that it will not look good on a 16X9 television. If anyone knows the producer of the film you might pass this information on to him. The technician did admit that they've received a number of calls on this issue."
1,Naqoyqatsi is a horrible film-and not at all worth seeing,"I doubt Reggio decided before doing Koyanisqatsi that he would create a total of 3 films-all which have no correlation whatsoever. I think it is false advertising to call these 3 films a ""Trilogy"" when the only thing they all have in common is the fact that it is all images and no dialogue. I watched this on DVD and saw that Reggio compiled a bunch of stock footage and just edited it creating a hodgepodge of meaningless, repetitive visuals that were lacking in originality.Koyanisqatsi was a great film, in my opinion. Unfortunately, Naqoyqatsi did not live up to my expectations and left me w/a poor impresson of Reggio as a director. My boyfriend and I scanned fast forward on the DVD and could not believe how nothing tied together. If people want to sit and assume, or buy into the idea that this is a masterpiece-then you are creatively challenged. The only way to find this remotely interesting is to drop some blotter or fungi and watch."
2,Digital Vomit,"What a complete disappointment. I waited patiently for 15 years for the completion of the Qatsi trilogy, and Reggio pukes up a video nightmare. The first two films had moments of beauty to contrast the theme of technological hell, but Naqoyqatsi is completely bereft of any aesthetics whatsoever. Only the beginning shots of an old Michigan train station and later of deep iterations of the Mandelbrot Set held any kind of aesthetic quality. This is just a moralistic harangue about how the 21st century, with all its dizzying digital unreality, really and truly sucks. Yo Yo Ma was good, but that's about it. Man, I hate the 21st Century."
3,oh yuk,"This is a mess..what happened??The best thing about the whole movie was the opening scenes in theabandoned building..and I would love to know where those scenes were shot.They never go back to scenes,which is really confusing. What were they there for??Too much overly bright shots,this is far below their other superb movies."
1,"Music Great, but the Movie Absolutely Sucked","This movie is the weakest of all of the ""qatsi"" movies. I've watched it 3 times now and it still has no rhyme or reason to it. It looks like they made it because Philip Glass had written the final score of the trilogy and they just a slapped together a movie to go with the music, which is a shame because the music is excellent.I gave Koyaanisqatsi 5 stars, Powaqqatsi 3 stars, but this I give this 1 star all just for music. Save yourself some money and buy the CD, which is fantastic."
2,Too Many [American] Flags,"This film has some beautifully striking moments but, on the whole, there are just plain too many [American] flags for most people to stomach and, after a while, even the most admiring aficionados of the ""-qatsi"" series are going to notice that the letters ""U.S.A."" appear too often. If you want patriotism, go to a baseball game with ""Who Let the Dogs Out"" as piped music - for ""Naqoyqatsi"" it goes as well as cyanide in the blood stream."
3,"CAUTION:This is NOT Blu Ray, regardless of ad picture","Cigala & Tango: Gran RexThe main purpose here is to forewarn other potential buyers that this is a standard dvd, NOT a Blu Ray even though the picture in the advertising shows a blu ray box. However, I have other Cigala products and trust that the music contained herein is equally fine. I have yet to open the sealed box and play it. The only other reviewer gave it a 5 (via Spanish), so that is probably accurate. My lower rating reflects my great disappointment at the misleading advertising. I am sure the defendant would hide behind the fact that the text in the ad refers to DVD. My guess is that 9 out of 10 people are under the impression that Blu Ray is a type of DVD and would thus fall victim to the trap laid by the use of a blu ray box in the advertisement. I only paid $12.57 plus s&h; for it, so I'll just keep it."
2,music from Sao Tome,"interesting CD, although a bit monotonous, I expected different views on music from Sao Tome, the country certainly has a wider range of variety in its music. This CD is too traditional."
5,YOU WILL LOVE THIS,"I have many of Max's books as well as this one. As always, well written, easy to understand. He gives you an understanding of God that you can't get anywhere else. Go for them all. You will be enriched!"
5,A wonderful book that reaches deep into your heart,"I have read a few books by this author, and this is my favorite. Not only did it touch my heart, with stories like the one about Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, it challenged me to think deeply about issues of faith. Max Lucado has a wonderful gift of bringing Bible stories to life, and this book has produced in me a greater thirst for God's word. The study guide at the end is great! Although I haven't yet worked through it, I have read the questions and they are very thought-provoking. I wholeheartedly recommend this book."
1,amazon print size is misleading,"saw this book in paperback but print was a wee bit small. checked out the hardback on amazon and the print seemed much better when I looked 'inside', but when the book came, the print size was no different than in the paperback. If amazon is going to let us 'look inside' the look should be accurate.seems small to many people but my vision is not as good as it used to be.Max Lucado always gets 5 stars but amazon messed up big time"
2,Lacking new Insight to an age-old problem,"I waited in anticipation for this book to arrive. Much hype had been made about this new research and the 21 day plan. Business men and women stuggle to balance work and home-life, and the foundation of this book is right on. If we loose weight, drink more water and exercise we will have more energy for both. The problem with this book is that it says very little more. I found myself brousing through the book looking for new ideas to give me some boost. The book does have some excellent chapters on how to deal with stress in the work place. In fact, this book is worth buying just for these two chapters. However, for those of us who read self help books on a daily basis, you might be looking for more."
4,Great content,"I bought this book after hearing a presentation Groppel made at a conference a few years ago, and being impressed with what he had to say there.The content of this book is great: simple, practical, accessible suggestions for improving your ""health and happiness"" through better exercise, diet, emotional balance, etc. I particularly like Groppel's pragmatic views on diet and exercise, which are not at all prescriptive, and thus attainable for anyone, no matter what their age and current activity level. I'm slowly trying to adopt his approaches and am finding them helpful. My one criticism is that the book is not very well-written: he tends to ramble a little at times and say similar things in multiple sections of a chapter in a rather unstructured way. If you can put up with that minor problem, you should get a lot of benefit from the book."
4,Great book!,"A great book for those that feel that there is a definite connection between physical fitness and career performance. Great for those already fit, but can be an inspiration to those who are not, but could benefit from some support as to the benefits of doing so. Read it, then read it once a year to refresh."
5,Corporate Athlete -- what does it take to become one?,"The Corporate Athlete provides insight that helps individuals perform at their peak -- maximum performance. Just like professional athletes train, so must corporate ""athletes"". It's a fine art to balance your mental, physical, emotional and spirtual life. Dr. Groppel provides a great plan to help you realize what's important, and how to achieve your full potential. I wish I would have read this 20 years ago....but it's never too late to become your very best! I'd highly recommend this book. Put a plan in action -- the proof is in your mindset and willingness to commit to action -- which the author provides careful details and a road map."
2,Save your nickel,One goodie-good kid and overpowering parent wrote this book. Not very helpful in directing the youth. A video would be more helpful.
3,Second shelf Beach Boys,"Seem like this CD was a catch-all for tunes the label didn't know what to do with. Some of the selections are classic Beach Boys, but tunes like ""Spirit of America""; and others are yawners that make us go into the kitchen to browse through the fridge. Die hard fans no doubt need this in their collection, but most could not have it and never miss it."
5,Awesome!,I have been wanting this cd for a longtime1 Very PLEASED with the looks of the cd & the sound was INCREDIBLE! Thanks & God Bless Amazon!
1,Boring boring boring,I get the whole concept of the video but it didn't keep my attention is very dry and boring and a waste my money.
3,Learning Spanish,"If you are a fan of learning foreign languages, such as I am, then this book is the right choice to help in learning Spanish. Although you might still need a tutor if you want to advance in your Spanish conversation skills, this book can help with learning how to sharpen your thinking caps in terms of learning Spanish. The exercises are perfect in terms of toning in your comprehension skills, I believe that this book should be used for the late-Beginner level and early-Intermediate level in terms of where you, the learner, might be in terms of your language learning level, specifically in Spanish. I say this because I believe that there are some exercises in this book that might not make sense to an early-Beginner or, perhaps on a curve, a middle-Beginner level of a Spanish language student. Either way, this book is helpful to learn Spanish."
5,Stretching out,"I knew the Germs back in the 80s and have seen Pat grow with his music. I admire his achievements to this date, and he's made good choices. His solo CD is a breath of fresh air for him and on a creative level, very experimental as well as another step up from where he needs to go next. Although his demeanor is of a contemplative quiet nature, he's the force that leads a band."
3,The Original Packaging Was All But Destroyed!!!!!,Overall the product was in good condition but the packaging was terrible. Looks like the box was dug out of last weeks trash. But Dig Em was in good shape himself. Do a better job of care for the original packaging.
4,deep poetic electric countryfied cosmic blues,"they are back. after a disapointing,very unstructured album/""OPEN""Michael,Margo and the boys are back in the form that made us fans and thatmade them quasi-famous. top notch,tight musicianship and crisp recordingof a very good set of angular electric musings and thoughtful lyrics.""A DUSTY SIMPLE MINDED PIECE OF FICTION. STRANGE AND ODD,TWISTED AS ACONTRADICTION, A GLITTERING JEWEL OF FLAWS AND CELEBRATION""/ song: WHY THIS ONE. there are a very few weaker tracks that I personally find myself skipping over ""JESUS,SWEET JESUS,CAN YOU PASS ME TO YOUR PA?""but overall this is a very solid effort from a very solid Canadian/American band.I am very gratified to see these folks come back this strongly."
4,"Get ""One Soul Now"" now.","Like any album, this one gets better each time I listen to it. This isn't their best or worst album, but it's pretty solid. ""Stars Of Our Stars"" is the rocker on here, the rest is typical ""Junkies"" material. All is good, but favorites are ""No Long Journey Home"" and ""Why This One"". The bonus disc is also a major extra, including covers of ""Springsteen"", ""Neil Young"", ""The Cure"", and two others. I wouldn't call this album alone essential, but if you can get it with the bonus covers disc, essential."
1,dissapointing effort,"I found this cd to be a big let down. most of the songs have a monotonous dirge like quality, even the musical arraingments are uninspired. overall this is a flat sounding cd with very few interesting or inspired moments"
4,Their best!,"Weird, I'm not a huge Junkies fan, and I like this one best and not the ones most fans love. Lay it Down is good, Trinity is way over-rated. The songs here have depth and they develop in interesting ways. And they aren't all one-note. This is their best album easily. Best Tracks: One Soul Now, No Long Journey Home, Stars, Hunting Ground, Wild Child. Why This One is the best and grooviest song they have."
2,If you liked Open you'll probably like this one,"I'm an avid Cowboy Junkies fan, but their last two albums, Open and now One Soul Now, just haven't done it for me. The band is definitely moving in a new direction, I just personally don't like it. There are a few good tracks on the CD, but, I find myself hitting the fast forward button too often."
1,Don't waste your money!,I bought this off of a person who said they bought it here and the CD-Rom won't even work. What's the use in having this CD-Rom if the games won't play?! I've heard rumor that the servers where the games are played thru are no longer in existence and that's why the games played via email won't work. Don't waste your money on this one!
5,Amazing,This is a amazing read. She is the reason womens wrelsting Is what it is today. I think this is a great read for anyone
4,OLD SCHOOL OF WRESTLING,"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT THE LIFE AND WRESTLING CAREER OF LILLIAN ELLISON AKA(FABULOUS MOOLAH). IT IS INTERESTING AND ENTERTAINING IN MOST PARTS. SHE SPENDS ALOT OF TIME TELLING US HOW GREAT THE MCMAHON FAMILY IS (WHY NOT, THEY ARE HER EMPLOYER)BUT NOT ENOUGH TIME ABOUT BEHIND THE SCENES. SHE ALSO MAKES US BELIEVE THAT SHE GAVE EVERYONE WHO WRESTLED HER THE BEATING OF THEIR LIFE. I THINK ALOT OF THIS BOOK HAS BEEN EXAGGERATED BY MOOLAH. BUT YET I LIKED IT. NOTHING GREAT BUT STILL AN OK READ."
1,"Moolah is Fabulous, in her own mind that is","After the success of Mick Foley's first autobiography it seems that everybody associated with the pro wrestling business is now writing their tales of the squared circle. Sadly, while Foley's book was excellent, the majority of these wrestling books are cheaply put together pieces of lies, fluff and self-promotion. You can add Lillian Ellison's name to this list, although to be technical, the actual name would be Fabulous Moolah. Moolah is one of those people who got famous by being around for so long, that everyone would just assume there must be something special about her. This book, however, shows just how conceited and deluded she is when it comes to her place in wrestling history. To read these pages you would think that wrestling begins and ends with Moolah. Well, women's wrestling nearly did end BECAUSE of Moolah, but that's another story....All in all, yet another ... cash-in on the wrestling boom that is insulting to the readers' intelligence."
4,Warren Commemorative,"I was most impressed by this issue.The sound quality is exemplary and the potted biography illuminating. Coming to the the ""voice"" itself, it is an extraordinary instrument, not unlike Titta Ruffo in timbre and power, and melifluous in the more tender moments. My only disappointment centred on the Falstaff and Otello items: a little too generalised, where perhaps he could have sacrificed beauty of tone for the characterisation displaid elsewhere on these discs and of course in his complete recordings. But never mind. This is certainly a collection worth having and one which I shall return to with pleasure and admiration. Please can we have more of his deleted material?"
4,Real Verdi singing,"Thomas Hampson should be tied down and forced to listen to this great artist sing Verdi, THE WAY IT SUPPOSED TO BE SUNG. He would learn about phrasing, breath control, power, tone, artistry and drama all at the same time. Hampson can't carry Maestro Warren's scores for him."
1,an opportunity missed,"Aside from 4 ""previously unissued"" tracks, everything on these CDs is available elsewhere especially Romophone and Myto. This is a dispapointing release that could have been far more valuable by making available Warren's live or privately recorded material. For example, the book mentions Warren's Met Audition on the Air. A fellow artist, John Carter, recorded his parts of the program - which included the duet from THE PEARL FISHERS with Warren. The annual CD for a UK magazine, THE RECORD COLLECTOR, included this track. Why couldn't it have been used by the Warren Foundation. Ditto for Warren's live Met material, much of which is beyond the 50-year copyright limit.The answer is that instead of celebrating Warren's art, their goal was a quick buck from readily availabe material. But, maybe such laziness complements the equally poor biography."
3,Needs more examples from OTHER companies catalogs,"After reading this book, I found it to have some good ideas, but it was too specific. I thought the author was just writing a book to promote his catalog because, unlike other catalog books, he used examples from HIS catalog. While the page with the Highland attire was a good example, all of the pages from his catalog just became overkill. It would have been much better had to also used examples from a variety of catalogs."
3,Did you notice?,"For diehard fans of the show, you will have noticed this, but for the others who bought it, or plan on buying it, please note: The last two episodes in this collection are out of order. ""Happy Anniversary"" (for obvious reasons) is the last episode of the season. I'm surprised it wasn't caught before it was released, but maybe it makes these copies collectors' items..."
2,"Please, stop whining!","I had remembered this show as much cuter and sweeter than it really was. If I hear another New Yorker whine about how life is not all about them I think I'll puke! There is such potential for a series about newlyweds, but these two just seem to have some complaint about everything and everyone."
2,Boring formula,"A formulaic comedy without much happening. The male lead becomes less irritating but remains two-dimensional after the first 12 or so episodes. Helen Hunt is fun to watch, even if she isn't given much to do. All the other characters are so two-dimensional they're almost one-diensional."
1,is this really necessary?,"having to watch the show for the 2 seconds required when flipping past it was bad enough, but to enshrine the 1st season onto dvd? puhlease! paul reiser got lucky with this windbag of a sitcom. the writing was NEVER funny. the only thing this drab show had going for it was helen hunt- and she is a dramatic actress HELLO! mad about you was horrible and terribly over rated. if a friend ever gives this to me as a gift, i will never speak to him/her again. i could never stand this show and the fact that its now been immortalized on dvd makes me even more annoyed."
1,The Show was Bad enough,"This DVD is an expample of unchecked greed , and half formed talents. Fortunately helen Hunt managed to break out of this rut.The show was a waste of time , the DVD a waste of time, and money."
3,"good, but some errors","IN MY ORIGINAL ORDER, I GOT TWO COPIES OF THE SAME DVD, INSTEAD OF THE FULL SEASON 1. I WAS ABLE TO RETURN THE WRONG ORDER, BUT I HAD TO PAY FOR IT BECAUSE I'M NOT IN THE USA.THE NEW ORDER ARRIVED ON TIME, BUT THERE WAS A MINOR PROBLEM WITH THE LABELLING ON DISC 2. THE ORDER OF THE FINAL TWO EPISODES IS REVERSED, WHICH MEANT THAT I WATCHED THE SEASON FINALE BEFORE THE EPISODE PRECEDING THE SEASON FINALE.THIS WAS ANNOYING, BUT NOT A HUGE PROBLEM, SO I DIDN'T RETURN THE ORDER. BESIDES, I WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY TO RETURN THE ORDER."
3,This is not the show it eventually becomes.,"The first season is much more about Paul than it is about Paul and Jamie. The series started out as the story of a man who falls in love and is struggling to give up being a bachelor in favor of the romantic relationship. It was not until the third season that the show began to take shape into what it is best known as: one of the greatest romantic comedy series TV has ever seen.The first season features Selby, Paul's bachelor friend who constantly tempts Paul's wild side. His character does nothing for the series and was dropped after this first season. I remember seeing first-season episodes only when the show was first syndicated, and it seems they've since been taken out of rotation.Buy this if you love the show and want to see subsequent seasons on DVD. But be prepared: this is not the show as you came to love it during its last 5 seasons."
2,Distractingly Poor Video-Quality,"I foolishly ignored the comments about how the episodes were crammed onto two discs. I'm not a videophile, I don't own an HDTV, and I don't watch DVDs on my laptop. Even on a regular TV, the video quality was so poor that it was distracting. I would almost rather the old videotapes that I made of the show when it was on NBC -- commercials and all. I'm sorry I paid 30 bucks for this.I won't review the first season itself, because you probably already know whether or not you're a fan of the show. If you are, what you should ask yourself is are you going to be able to endure seeing it so shoddily rendered."
4,You don't want to miss it,Ilike this series very much and it was nice to be able to watch them completly
4,A good investment for M.A.Y. fans,"If you like Mad About You, you will really enjoy this selection. There are 22 great episodes on 2 discs (11 each). You will relive the witty banter of Fran, Mark, Selby, cousin Ira, and of course Paul and Jamie. The only thing keeping this from getting all 5 stars is that there aren't any special features of any kind. But, it is still great to be able to watch a great episode any time you like, without any commercials."
4,"5+ stars for the show, 4 for the DVD, well worth it!","This was a truly fantastic program which still makes me laugh out loud. People have complained about the quality of the video on the DVD, and the reordering of episodes, and certainly those things are poor decisions by Sony, but it's still well worth having and enjoying this wonderful show! If you like, you can get the list of episodes in airdate order here so you can watch them as they were aired: http://epguides.com/MadAboutYou/season1.shtmlEnjoy the show! I hope they bring out the rest of the seasons soon -- not excerpts like ""The Mad About You Collection"", but the full seasons."
3,Out of sequence episodes are so frustrating.,"What can I say?Mad About You is a fantastic show and the actors are just brilliant.You could almost believe that Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt are really man and wife.I don't even mind the less than perfect picture quality, which shows itself particularly in the first few episodes, where the graininess is quite pronounced.However, the most frustrating thing is the way some episodes are out of sequence, with the biggest problem being episodes 21 and 22 being back to front.This results in Fran (Leila Kenzle) admiting to an indiscretion in episode 21, that doesn't actually take place until episode 22.I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that season 2 isn't also out of sequence."
5,Oh this is so terrific!!!,"This is one of the classic series of all time. There is everything about being a couple in this series, a modern couple of the '90s that is. Jamie and Paul are the couple, the New York city typical, or sometimes not-so-typical, couple that everything revolves around. And then there's Murray the dog, their dear companion through the whole series. There's also Fran and Mark, also a married couple that they can pal around with. Lisa, Jamie's ditzy sister jumps in and out at the most inexpected moments. And let's not forget Paul's parents, oh yes, the in-laws, they're always there in some form. It all makes for some interesting and unusual moments that we can all relate and laugh and cry to. This is so wonderful to have on DVD now, I can throw away some of those poorly abused VCR tapes. It'll be a joy to relive the Buchman's all over again!"
5,Geek Redemption,"I found this book very amusing and entertaining. It was easy reading and the perfect vacation book. After reading the book, I have come to believe that there is a ""little bit of geek"" in all of us."
5,This is not your typical self-help book.,"I found Geek Redemption amusing and entertaining. While I have observed many of the same type happenings as did Johnny Dupa while growing up and entering the workforce, much of this behavior is never mentioned. I too have had a pocket protector for my pens and can readily identify with the ""snake"" attack on your girlfriend. I now wonder aloud, if executives with whiz-bang computers while their secretary types on a clunker, will qualify for geekdom. Surely those who can't make it from the 1st to the 5th floor without bottled water should be allowed entry.While the stories are light and humorous, it does shed some light on the cause and effect of our behavior and how we react to illogical situations. In the real world, I do fear we are headed for the Star Trek Federation as described in the book.Perhaps after reading this book you will see office politics in an entirely different light."
1,Pass on this.,Just what one would expect from Dupa. A dull and uninteresting tale by an obvious introvert.
2,catchy,"The ring is very pretty, and seems worthwhile, but we found that it catches on clothing, and even upholstery fabric at times."
5,Great Product,"I am able to charge my phone with no proble, plus with the proper software downloaded of ActiveSync you can get anything you want on your phone..."
4,"Works great, except for CD","This cable works great for music transfer, etc. The only problem was that the programs that are on the included CD will not connect to the phone. Other applications worked fine. Great price compared to anywhere else."
1,Got everything in good condition but did not did work.,"From looking at the reviews this product seems pretty hit or miss as far as working goes. I have Windows XP and after trying two different methods(installing the software it came with and installing V Cast Music Manager), it still does not work."
3,"Cheap, provides a data connection","It's an original OEM Samsung cable, and it works. My only gripe is that it does NOT charge the phone. I have to dock two stars for that because USB probably provides enough current to. (The original charger is rated at 0.7 A and USB provides a maximum of 0.5 A)"
4,seems to work fine,"I've only used this cable once, so far, but it seems to work fine, and I don't anticipate any problems, any time soon. It was less expensive than Verizon Wireless's audio accessories package."
5,Great buy,Very satisfy about this cable. I saved lots of money because of purchasing a non OEM data cable. It works well and I got what I want at a cheap price.
2,Didn't try it yet,I try it with a Mac OSX with no success yet thought I didn't take much time to research if any software is need it or available.
3,Neithah heah naw theah,"The software would not work (I have Windows XP), which is a problem I encounter frequently with products. It seems that manufacturers spend all their time on the hardware, and none on the software. But, once I downloaded a USB driver from elsewhere, the hardware (cable) worked just fine."
1,"Oops, something went wrong","Well, unfortunately, it did not fit my cell phone. It was really inexpensive so not worth sending back. Will have to try again. Could be my fault or not."
